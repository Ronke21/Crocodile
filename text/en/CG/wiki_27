<text>Wem is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England, north of Shrewsbury and south of Whitchurch.

The name is derived from the Old English term , meaning &#x27;marsh&quot;.

As a caput of a barony and a large manor and parish Wem was a centre for justice and local government for centuries, and the headquarters of the North Shropshire District Council until Shropshire became a unitary authority. From the 12th century revisions to the hundreds of Shropshire, Wem was within the North Division of Bradford Hundred until the end of the 19th century.

It is considered that the landscape around the town may be the inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &#x27;As You Like It&#x27;, a belief reflected in cultural programming in the town.

==History==

=== Prehistory and Roman era===
The area now known as Wem is believed to have been settled prior to the Roman Conquest of Britain, by the Cornovii, Celtic Iron Age settlers: there is an Iron Age hillfort at nearby Bury Walls occupied over into the Roman period, and the Roman Road from Uriconium to Deva Victrix ran close by to the east at Soulton.

It is understood a lost Roman camp may have been in the area, called Rutunium.

=== Post-Roman period===
The Wem Hoard, a collection of coins deposited in the post-Roman period, was found in land in the Wem area in 2019.

=== Norman and medieval periods ===
&quot;Weme&quot; was an Anglo-Saxon estate, which transitioned into a planned Norman castle-town established after the conquest, with motte-and-bailey castle, parish church and burgage plots. The town is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as consisting of four manors in the hundred of Hodnet. At Domesday the town comprised:

* Households: 4 villagers. 8 smallholders. 2 slaves.
* Land and resources: ploughland: 8 ploughlands. 1 lord&#x27;s plough teams. 1 men&#x27;s plough teams.
* Other resources: woodland 100 pigs.

with an annual value to lord: 2 pounds in 1086; up to 1 pound 7 shillings in 1066.


The Domesday Book records that Wem was held by William Pantulf (Guillaume Pantol in French) and is its first known Lord. Orderic Vitalis described Pantulf as:

kind to the poor, to whom he was liberal in alms, he was firm in prosperity and adversity, put down all his enemies, and exercised great power through his wealth and possessions.

Pantulf fought at the Battle of Hastings under his superior lord Earl Roger. Stafford Castle and Wem was granted to him with a further 28 manors in the area bounded by Clive, Ellesmere, Tilley and Cresswell, with some of the manors within this area belonging to other lords (Prees to the Bishop of Lichfield, and Soulton to the King&#x27;s Chapel in Shrewsbury Castle, for example).

Pantulf refused to participate in an 1102 rebellion against King Henry I led by Robert de Belesme and assisted the crown defeating it, by marching with the king on Shrewsbury, during which the roads in the area were found to be bad, thickly wooded, providing cover for archers: 6000 foot soldiers cut down the woods and opened up the roads. Hugo Pantulf, a descendant of William, was Baron of Wem in the mid 1100s: he attended the court of Richard the Lion Heart, was Sheriff of Shropshire, and likely attended the Crusades with the king, certainly paying scutage to towards his ransom.

The Norman town was probably enclosed by an earthwork: there is a record from the lord&#x27;s steward of repairs to the town&#x27;s enclosure in 1410, in which year the town had been &quot;totally burnt and wasted by the Welsh rebels&quot;. There is some speculation that the town had walls by the 1400s, as Samuel Garbet recorded an annotation to Fabyan&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; that Wem &quot;was totally burnt to the ground, with its walls and castle&quot; in the reign of Henry VI.

The supposed route of the walls or earthworks follows Noble Street, Wem Brook, the Roden and crossing the High Street between Leek Street and Chapel Street.

There were bars at the three entrances to the town, and a 1514 record exists of four men being employed to keep the bars on market days.

There is some thought that a market was held from the days of Pantuf, but King John certainly granted a charter in 1202. Initially, the permission was for a Sunday market. This was subsequently revised, in 1351, to a Thursday: this followed a decree of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Islip in the reign of Edward III that Sunday markets were banned. Wem&#x27;s market day remains Thursday to this day.

The manor was held by some of the great baronial families: including the Earls of Arundel, and the Lords Dacre, Bradford and Barnard and, after the 14th century the lord of the manor was not resident.

During the course of 1483, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (linked by some historians with the murder of the Princes in the Tower), was engaged in rebellion against Richard III with Henry Tudor. By October of that year Buckingham&#x27;s army were in the Hereford area, and fighting for survival and the campaign was unravelling in deteriorating weather; Buckingham&#x27;s army deserted. Disguised as a simple labourer he fled north to Shropshire and went into hiding at Lacon Hall, the house of a local retainer, Ralph Bannister who betrayed him for £1000.

An account of the capture of the Duke is as follows:

&quot;he was disguised and digging a ditch at the time of his arrest; and on the approach of Thomas Mytton the sheriff, who came to apprehend him, he knelt down in the orchard wherein he was taken, and solemnly imprecated vengeance upon the traitor and his posterity, which curses are said to have been signally fulfilled...shortlie after [Bannister] had betrayed the duke his master, his sonne and heyre waxed mad, and so dyed in a bore&#x27;s stye: his eldest daughter, of excellent beautie, was sodainly stricken with a foule leperye; his second sonne very marvellously deformed of his limmes and made decrepit; his younger sonne in a small puddel was strangled and drowned; and he, being of extreme age, arraigned and found gyltie of a murder, and by his clergye saved: And as for his thousand pounds, kyng Richard gave him not one farthing, howbeit some say he had a small office or a ferme to stop his mouth.&quot;

Buckingham was subsequently tried, convicted and executed for treason at Salisbury.

This incident is referred to by William Shakespeare in the play &quot;Richard III&quot;, in Act IV, scene iv:

&quot;Third Messenger&quot;
The news I have to tell your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Buckingham&#x27;s army is dispersed and scatter&#x27;d;
And he himself wander&#x27;d away alone,
No man knows whither.
&quot;KING RICHARD III&quot;I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim&#x27;d
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

Large common fields farmed in strips lay outside the town walls: Pool Meadows (waste ground by the river within the lord&#x27;s demesne); Cross Field (lying toward Soulton, and thought to have been named for a wayside cross); Middle Field (part of which was later known as Leper Middle Field, giving an insight into medieval life); and Chapel Field (named after a chapel of ease on the Horton Road dedicated to St John which was suppressed in 1548). There was a Manorial Court House at Wem in which a twice yearly Court leet with the grim privilege of a gallows, hearing pleas including hue-and-cry, bloodshed.

=== Tudor period ===
In Henry VIII&#x27;s reign Lord Dacre (d. 1563) began to fell Northwood, a task completed by the Countess of Arundel (d. 1630), his grand-daughter. Dacre also drained the Old Pool, work again completed by his grand-daughter.
During the 1550s Sir Rowland Hill (&quot;Old Sir Rowland&quot;) publisher of the Geneva Bible, built a headquarters at Soulton Hall, ranging over to Hawkstone Follies where his activities are thought to have provided some of the inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Certainly, &quot;Old Sir Rowland&quot; bought both of those manors from Sir Thomas Lodge, father of Thomas Lodge, the acknowledged author of the source text.

Another important connection of antiquarian note is that the Cotton family, who came to hold the Cotton Library (a foundational collection of the British Library, including the Beowulf manuscript and copies of Magna Carta) originated in the Wem area and by the sixteenth century had the manor at Alkington nearby, members of this family were early patrons of Inigo Jones at Norton-in-Hales.

By 1561 the former castle enclosure was held at will by the rector, John Dacre. Manor perquisites noted in 1589 show that there were two annual fairs where the lord took a toll on all goods worth above 12&quot;d.&quot; sold by strangers and tenants (but not burgagers) and the profits of the courts. In 1579 the lord&#x27;s steward ruled that there should not be more than five alehouses in the township; however, unlicensed brewers were not prevented and were fined in number at each court leet.

=== 1600s ===
==== Civil war ====
In early 1642 Royalists were staying in Wem.

In September 1642, during the English Civil War Charles I passed close by Wem &quot;en route&quot; from Chester to Shrewsbury at the invitation of the corporation of the latter town where he made a temporary capital, taking the route via Soulton and Lee Brockhurst which corresponds to the old Roman Road.

However, in September 1643, the town was planted with a Parliamentarian garrison.

Under the supervision of Sir William Brereton a broad ditch four yards deep and wide and rampart, strengthened by a palisade made from timber cut from a felled 50 acre wood at Loppington was thrown up around the town to fortify it (some traces of this survive in the town). The route of this fortification was as follows: it began at a wooden tower on Soulton Road, just beyond the present station, from there it ran to &quot;Shrewsbury Gate&quot; crossing Well Walk and the bottom of Roden House garden; it than ran to the &quot;Ellesmere Gate&quot; where the stream crossed road; the earthworks continued along the back of Noble Street to &quot;Whitchurch Gate&quot;; on from there to &quot;Drayton Gate&quot; at 18 Aston Street and then back to the wooden tower. Many of the buildings beyond this rampart were destroyed in fortifying the town, to prevent them being of use to attackers.

In October, 1643 Lord Capell, was dispatched by the Royalists to the area to seek to retake Wem. H. Pickering (who served under Lord Capel) writing to the Duchess of Beaufort sets out the engagement as follows:

3 cannon, 2 drakes, one great mortarpiece that carried a 30ln. bullet, had 120 odd wagons and carriages laden with bread, biskett, bare and other provisions and theire armye being formydable as consistynge of neer 5,000.

Wem was not ready for the attack: the walls were not finished, the gates were not hinged, some of the guns on the ramparts were wooden dummies and the defending force consisted of only 40 male Parliamentarians; but then the local women rallied round positioning themselves in red coats in well chosen spots to mislead the Royalists.

On 17–18 October 1643 Royalist attackers formed up on one side, approaching Wem only from Soulton Road. The commander, Lord Capel, lightheartedly smoking his pipe half a mile from the town on that road. The town was not taken and the manoeuvre lasted less than a day resulting in this couplet:

The women of Wem and a few musketeers.

Beat the Lord Capel and all his Cavaliers.

It has been suggested that Sir Rowland Hill&#x27;s statecraft involved the accumulation of state papers and culturally important texts at Soulton, which then passed, via the Alkington Cottons into the Cotton Library, which includes the Beowulf manuscript and copies of Magna Carta, and this offers a potential explanation for the battle of Wem in the English Civil War during which Soulton was ransacked. After this incident it is further recorded the houses of the neighbouring seat(s) of the Royalist Hill family, at Soulton and possibly Hawkstone &quot;[were] pillaged, and ransacked by the rebel [parliamentarians]&quot;, and after this that family had to go into hiding in the Hawkstone landscape and caves.

Brereton&#x27;s report claimed Royalist losses in the Wem engagement were heavy.
Prince Rupert came to the district in 18 February 1644, was welcomed by Shrewsbury&#x27;s aldermen and made Shrewsbury his headquarters. Shortly afterwards he passed by Wem to the west and remarked of it:

It was a crow&#x27;s nest that would not afford each of his men a piece of bread.

Prince Rupert also mustered troops a short distance to the east at nearby Prees Heath.

Wem was the seat of the Shropshire Committee until the fall of Royalist Shrewsbury in 1645.

The sword of a Cromwellian trooper was dug up at Wem in 1923, and a cannonball of the same period was found during construction work at the Grammar School.

==== Restoration ====
In 1648 Hinstock, Loppington, and Wem were assessed for sale, and lands were sold from the manorial holdings throughout the 1650s. By 1665, when Daniel Wycherley bought the manor, the manorial property was much reduced from the holding it had been in 1648.

William Wycherley, Daniel&#x27;s son, was born at Clive near Shrewsbury, although his birthplace has been said (by Lionel Cust) to be Trench Farm to the north near Wem later the birthplace of another writer, John Ireland, who was said to have been adopted by Wycherley&#x27;s widow following the death of Ireland&#x27;s parents.
Wem was held by Judge Jeffreys (1645–1689), known as the &quot;hanging judge&quot; for his willingness to impose capital punishment on supporters of the Duke of Monmouth, who had bought the manor from Daniel Wycherley. His seat was Lowe Hall at The Lowe, Wem. In 1685 he was made Baron Jeffreys of Wem.

==== Great Fire of Wem ====
On 3 March 1677, a fire destroyed many of the wooden buildings in the town, the event came to be known as the &quot;Great Fire of Wem&quot;. Jane Churn dropped a candle, which started a huge fire. The intense heat partly melted the church bells, which had to be recast. A contemporary account of this disaster was as follows:

This dreadful fire began on Saturday, between seven and eight o&#x27;clock, at a small house near the upper end of Leek-lane, which stood on the same ground which Mr. Phillips&#x27;s brewhouse now stands. It was occasioned by the carelessness of a girl, about fourteen years of age, called, Jane Churm, who went up stairs to fetch some fuel kept under a bed, in order to make a good fire against the return of her sister, Catharine Morris, of the New-street, who was washing linen at Oliver&#x27;s well, The inconsiderate girl whilst she was gathering the sticks together, stuck her candle in a twig that encompassed a spar, when catching the thatch, it set the house in flames; which being agitated by a violent tempestuous wind, soon defied all human means to extinguish them. It was a very dry season, and the houses were covered with straw, or shingles, so that the fire spread into several streets, and with such rapidity seized house after house, that in a short time the conflagration became general. A strong easterly wind blew the burning thatch and shingles to a vast distance, and the devouring flames ran along the High-street, Cripple-street, and the Horse Fair, consuming every edifice, the free school only excepted, as far as Burton&#x27;s pit, or the house of George Groom, when on a sudden the wind turned to the south-west, and carried the raging fire through the Noble-street as far as the Draw-well house. A great number of country people were now come in, who offered to assist Mr. Higginson in carrying out his goods, but he would not suffer any to be removed, being intent on the preservation of his house.

His barns and out-buildings were on fire, and the flames caught the pinnacle, the weather boards, and the shingles of his house, but by the care, and activity of the people in pouring out water, and casting off the shingles, an entire stop was put to time fire on that side, but on the other it ran the full length of the street. In the High-street the fire spread eastwards to the same point on the north side; on the opposite no farther than the same place where it began. In the Mill-street it extended to the Rector&#x27;s barns; in Leek-lane to the house of William Smith, late of John Hales. The church, the steeple, the market house, and seven score dwelling houses, besides treble the number of out-houses and buildings were burnt. In the space of one hour they were all on fire, and the blaze was so great, that at the distance of eight or nine miles it seemed very near, and gave almost as great a light as the moon in full. In the town was a scene of the greatest confusion, and horror. The wind blustered, time flames roared, women and children shrieked. People ran at the cry of fire, to the place where it began, and at their return found their own dwellings burning. In the streets they were scorched with excessive heat, in the fields they were ready to perish with cold. Some striving to save their houses, with them lost all their goods, others despairing to extinguish the flames, attempted to carry off their most valuable effects, and many lost by thieves what they had saved from the fire; one man, and several cattle were consumed in the flames. The man was Richard Sherratt, a shoemaker, who lived on that ground where Sarah Jones now does. Having fetched a parcel of shoes out of his shop, he was seen to go under the market house, which is supposed to have fallen on him.

An estimate being taken of the buildings, and the value of the goods consumed by fire, it was computed that the buildings were worth £14,760. l0s. and the household goods £8,916. 13s. 1d, so that the whole loss amounted to about £23,677. 3s. 1d. for which a brief was obtained, dated the 31st of May, 1677.

A contemporary response to the disaster was written by Andrew Parsons, called &quot;Seasonable counsel to an afflicted people in a letter to the distressed inhabitants of Wem in the county of Salop, after the dreadful fire, which consumed that market-town, March 3. 1676,&quot; part of it read as follows:

...how could I be otherwise affected than Nehemiah was, Chap. 1.4, when he heard Jerusalem lay waste and burnt? He was astonished, wept and prayed to the God of Heaven. ...Wem would be built again, as Jerusalem was; the glory of whose second Temple exceeded that of the first, as did also their own Houses and habitations.. But is Wem burnt indeed? What, Wem! the place that God hath blessed, and where he hath as signally manifested hispower, goodness, forbearance, and mercy, as in any place you or I ever knew? And is this lot and fate at last befallen Wem? 

The King, Charles II, gave a commission to Thomas Hill of Soulton to receive and distribute the funds for the relief effort.

=== 1700s ===

By 1740 a workhouse existed in Wem, by 1777 it could house 20 inmates. During this period, the Old Town Hall, while still the Town Hall, was used for sittings of the County Court. The farming in this period saw an emphasis on dairy and grains. Other specializations included linen cloth.

The town was the childhood home of one of England&#x27;s greatest essayists and critics, William Hazlitt (1778–1830). Hazlitt&#x27;s father moved their family there when William was just a child. Hazlitt senior became the Unitarian Minister in the town occupying a building on Noble Street that still stands. In 2008 the town held a 230th Anniversary Celebration of Hazlitt&#x27;s Life and work for five days, hosted by author Edouard d&#x27;Araille who gave series of talks and conference about &#x27;William of Wem&#x27;. William Hazlitt moved away from Wem in later life and ultimately died in London.

Artist John Astley, writer John Ireland, and pugilist Joe Berks all also grew up in the town.

=== Victorian period ===
In the era of the stagecoach the town was served by two: &#x27;The Hero&#x27; called at the Castle and the Union Stagecoach at the White Lion.

Within the town the sweet pea was first commercially cultivated, under the variety named Eckford Sweet Pea, after its inventor, nursery-man Henry Eckford. He first introduced a variety of the sweet pea in 1882, and set up in Wem in 1888, developing and producing many more varieties.

There is a road to signify the Eckford name, called Eckford Park (within Wem). Each year, the Eckford Sweet Pea Society of Wem have held a sweet pea festival apart from the years 2020 and 2021. In Victorian times, the town was known as &quot;Wem, where the sweet peas grow&quot;.

=== 20th century ===

Several public buildings built in the early 20th century used the Arts and Crafts style: the Morgan Library building, the old post office and the current town hall building are examples.

==== First World War ====
Fifty-five men of Wem are recorded as having fallen serving their country in the First World War. The town&#x27;s war memorial was dedicated in 1920.

==== Second World War ====
In 1940 Anna Essinger (1879–1960), a German Jewish educator, evacuated her boarding school, Bunce Court School from Otterden, in Kent to Trench Hall, near Wem. She facilitated Kindertransport.

The US Army created a storage facility at Aston Park estate on 14 December 1942. The facility was later converted to a prisoner of war camp, and was used for that purpose until 1948.

Nineteen men of Wem are recorded to have died serving in the Second World War.

==== After the war ====
Wem was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

In November 1995 the town hall suffered a catastrophic fire. It reopened after repair, renewal, and redesign in 2000.

=== 21st century ===
From 2002 to 2019 the Morgan Library building was leased to &#x27;Mythstories&#x27;, which styles itself as the world&#x27;s first museum of storytelling.

Wem is a Transition Town.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain were resident in the area and the community built them an emergency performance space.

In late 2021 the town, being in the middle of the North Shropshire constituency, saw heavy campaigning in the by-election which saw a record swing.

In 2023 efforts began to establish a community owned pub in the district. The same year two community members of the town were each presented with British Empire Medal in a ceremony in the town hall presided over by the Lord Lieutenant.

== Culture ==
===Shakespeare ===

The town and wider community has held cultural programming and a Midsummer events to celebrate its association with William Shakespeare; this has also included charity openings of normally private woodlands and drama.

===Legends===

==== Secret tunnels ====
There is said to have been a tunnel from the cellars under the castle mound to the building formerly known as &quot;The Moathouse&quot;, and then on under Mill Street to Roden House, the former rectory, and there are blocked doorways in the cellars of both of these houses.

==== Witchcraft ====
Some time around 1660, some people of Wem suspected that they had found a witch. In the event the suspected witch was brought before Thomas Hill of Soulton, as justice of the district. They were spared any judicial processing as a witch and the case was disposed of mildly by the harsh standards of the time.

==== Wem ghost ====
In 1995 an amateur photographer photographed a blaze which destroyed Wem Town Hall; the photo appeared to show the ghostly figure of a young female in a window of the burning building, dressed in &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; clothes.

Although the photographer (who died in 2005) denied forgery, after his death it was suggested that the girl in his photo bore a &#x27;striking similarity&#x27; with one in a postcard of the town from 1922.

==== Treacle mines ====
Wem is reputed to have &quot;treacle mines&quot;, although it is not possible to mine treacle. Two explanations have been offered for this legend: (a) a confectioner&#x27;s shop, despite the rationing and food shortages of the Second World War, was apparently always in stock of candy; alternatively (b) the byproduct of the tanning industry within the town was considered to resemble treacle.


=== Recreation areas ===
There are recreation areas at the Wem Recreation Ground and the Millennium Green (Wem Millennium Green being the smallest such green in the country).

=== Events ===
Each year Wem holds a traditional town carnival which is held on the first Saturday of September.

The Sweet Pea Festival on the third weekend of July. Wem Vehicles of Interest Rally &amp; Grand Parade also runs alongside the Sweet Pea Festival on the Sunday.

A Wem running race was instituted in 2019.

There is a Wem Transport show annually in July.

==Governance==
Wem was historically the centre of a large parish, which became a civil parish in 1866. In 1891 the civil parish had a population of 3796.

On 1 April 1900 the parish of &quot;Wem&quot; was abolished and the outer parts of the parish were separated to form the civil parish of Wem Rural, and the town itself became the civil parish of Wem Urban, coextensive with Wem Urban District. In 1967 the urban district was abolished and became part of North Shropshire Rural District. From 1974 to 2009 it was part of North Shropshire district.

The parish council of Wem Urban has exercised its right to call itself a town council.

The electoral ward of Wem for the purposes of elections to Shropshire Council also covers part of Wem Rural parish. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 8,234.

==Economy ==
The pre-modern economy of the town was based on agriculture and forestry and the processing of its output. Brewing, initially a cottage industry, was carried out in Wem as early as 1700, when Richard Gough wrote of a contemporary in his &quot;History of Myddle&quot; a Latin aphorism he translated: &quot;Let slaves admire base things, but my friend still/My cup and can with Wem&#x27;s stoute ale shall fill.&quot;

By 1900 a Shrewsbury and Wem Brewery Company traded on a widespread scale after acquiring the brewery in Noble Street previously run by Charles Henry Kynaston. The company was taken over in turn by Greenall Whitley &amp; Co Ltd but the brewery was closed in 1988. From 1986 to 1988 the brewery was the shirt sponsor for Shrewsbury Town.

A new brewing company, Hanby was founded in December 1988 by Peter Simmonds and Jack Hanby, who had previously worked for the Greenall Whitley brewery in Wem. Initially located in rented accommodation in Aston Park, the company began brewing their own ales in Easter 1989 once they had suitable premises. The brewery was taken over in late 2008, following Hanby Ales going into receivership, to be renamed as Wem Brewing Company.

There is a mid-sized industrial estate to the east of the town.

== Coat of arms and flag ==
The Wem Town Council use arms which are the shield of Shropshire, with a phoenix crest, with the shield laid over of an axe and a scythe.

==Geography==
The River Roden flows to the south of the town.

The Shropshire Way long distance waymarked path passes through Wem.

== Education ==
St Peters is a Church of England primary school in Wem.

Thomas Adams School is a state-funded secondary school, established in 1650. This was an independent grammar school until 1976, at which point it merged with Wem Modern School to form a comprehensive school. It also has a Sixth Form College on site.

A number of private schools have operated in Wem over the centuries. William Hazlitt&#x27;s father ran a &#x27;model crammer for the dissenting rationalist&#x27; in the town, the &#x27;Mrs Swanswick&#x27;s School&#x27; ran from the late 1700s to the 1840s and one of its headmasters, Joseph Pattison, took a leading role in founding British Schools to educate children from less advantaged families. A further six private schools operated out of Wem over time.

== Religious life ==
Within the town there are four main churches:

* Anglican Parish Church of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul - this was once allied to nearby Edstaston Church of St Mary the Virgin and is currently aligned with St Luke&#x27;s Weston-under-Redcastle.
*Baptist
*Methodist
* Roman Catholic
A modern long barrow has recently been built at Soulton Long Barrow

The town has staged outdoor nativity plays.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Wrekin TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Capital North West and Wales. The Whitchurch Herald and Shropshire Star are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway was completed in 1858, and Wem has been connected to national rail services since this time.

The town has a railway station located on the Welsh Marches Line. All services are operated by Transport for Wales. The majority of services that call at the station are between Shrewsbury and Crewe, however, some long-distance services to Manchester Piccadilly, Cardiff Central, Swansea, Carmarthen and Milford Haven also stop at the station during peak times.

=== Canals ===
The canal network came closest to Wem at Whixhall and Edstaston; the Ellesmere canal was closed to navigation by Act of Parliament in 1944.

=== Air ===
There is an airfield at Sleap.

=== Bus ===
The town is served by the 511 and 512 bus route, operated by Arriva Midlands North, which runs between Shrewsbury and Whitchurch. Some services terminate in Wem and do not continue to Whitchurch.

== Twin towns ==
Since 1978, Wem has been twinned with Fismes in France, after which is named a road in Wem, Fismes Way.

<doc id="982022" wikidata="Q892177" url="?curid=982022" title="Sharp's Commercials">
<text>Sharps Commercials Ltd was a British car maker based in Preston, Lancashire. It was founded in 1922 by Paul Sharp. It changed its name to Bond Cars Ltd in 1963. The company was taken over by the Reliant Motor Co Ltd of Tamworth, Staffordshire in February 1969, who eventually closed the Preston factory at the end of July 1970, transferring the spare parts business for the Bond Minicar, 875 saloon, 875 Ranger van and Equipe models to a firm called Bob Joyner &amp; Son in Oldbury in the English Midlands. Reliant nevertheless continued to use the Bond name until 1974 on Bond Bug models made at their own Tamworth plant.

==Bond Minicar 1949–1966==

Sharp&#x27;s Commercials began production of an economical three-wheeled car early in 1949. Based on a design by Lawrie Bond, it was called the &quot;Bond Minicar&quot; (retrospectively to be called the Mark A) and was powered by a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers engine of 122 or 197 cc. Bodywork was mostly aluminium, though some later models used fibreglass for parts of the car. It proved very popular at the time owing to post-war economies. 

The Minicar moved on through several different incarnations, culminating in the &quot;Mark G&quot; in 1961. Convertibles were offered, as were van and estate versions. The engine was upgraded, first to a single-cylinder 250 cc and then to a 250 cc twin-cylinder Villiers 4T (optional only on the Mark G). The engines were essentially a Villiers motorcycle-type unit and therefore had no reverse gear. However, this was a minimal inconvenience, because the engine, gearbox and front wheel were mounted as a single unit and could be turned by the steering wheel up to 90 degrees either side of the straight-ahead position, enabling the car to turn within its own length.

Reverse gear of a sort was offered on later models, but using this involved stopping the engine and starting it backwards. This was achieved by reversing the Siba Dynastart unit, a device which doubled as both starter and generator. It operated as a starter motor when the starter button was pressed but when the engine was running it generated power instead and recharged the battery.

The last Bond Minicar, a Mark G, was made in November 1966.

==Bond Equipe 1963–1970==
The Equipe GT was Bond&#x27;s first four-wheel car, a sports car, with fibreglass two door body. Essentially it was a Triumph Herald chassis, complete with bulkhead, windscreen and doors, with the Triumph Spitfire 1147 cc engine. The doors had slightly revised glass, to accommodate the fibreglass fastback roof and rear assembly. The Herald&#x27;s forward hingeing bonnet was replaced with a revised version giving an excellent, clean sportscar-like appearance. This was replaced by the GT4S model in 1964, offering 4 seats, and an opening boot lid. In front, the beautiful Italianate bonnet styling was somewhat compromised by the addition of the quad headlights from the Triumph 2000, flanking a cut-down version of the original Herald grille. A bonnet scoop was also added. A 1296cc engine was introduced in 1967.
During the life of this car, it was not uncommon to see Triumph Heralds modified by the fitting of a Bond Equipe bonnet, as all the side body lines matched perfectly. Less common were Bond Equipes, bizarrely fitted with Herald front ends.

In August 1967, 19 months before the take-over by Reliant in February 1969, the new Equipe 2 Litre was introduced. Based partly on styling proposals by Trevor Fiore but mainly designed by Bond&#x27;s own in-house designer, Alan Pounder, the doors had new skins and all external traces of the Triumph Herald were gone, with the exception of the windscreen surround and the bonnet catches. The Triumph 2000 headlamps were retained, but were now incorporated into a more stylish, full width grille. At the rear, the Lucas triple-bullet tail-lamps were replaced and this version of the car began to resemble the later Reliant Scimitar SS1, which would not in fact appear for another twenty years. This model had the six-cylinder 2-litre Triumph Vitesse chassis and engine, uprated to the Mk 2 version in 1968, at which time a convertible version was also offered.

==Bond 875 1965–1970==
The Bond 875 was a three-wheeler with a rear-mounted four-cylinder 875 cc four-stroke, Hillman Imp engine. It was discontinued in 1970 after Reliant took over Bond.

==Bond Bug 1970–1974==
The Bond Bug, based on a Reliant Regal, became a fashion statement in the 1970s. The Bug was a three-wheeler with a Reliant 700 cc (later increased to 750 cc) four-cylinder engine and a top speed of . Finished in a lurid orange, the Bug had a &quot;wedge&quot; body styled by Tom Karen of Ogle Design. Lacking conventional doors, entry was gained by swinging the roof upwards on a pair of hinges.

==Other products==
Other products produced by the company included Motorscooters, a power ski, trailer tents, suitcases, etc.

<text>Juan Carlos Mortensen (born 13 April 1972, in Ambato, Ecuador) is an Ecuadorian professional poker player of Danish descent and the first South American Main Event winner of the World Series of Poker. Mortensen is known for his loose play, bluffing tactics, and interesting chip-stacking style.

== Poker career ==
=== World Series of Poker ===
Mortensen moved from Spain to the United States in the late 1990s to play poker. He won $1,500,000 at the 2001 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event. Mortensen defeated a then-record field of 613 players, including a very tough final table that included professional players Mike Matusow (sixth), 1989 WSOP Main Event champion Phil Hellmuth (fifth), Phil Gordon (fourth), and Dewey Tomko (second). In the final hand, Mortensen&#x27;s out-drew and defeated Tomko&#x27;s , when Mortensen&#x27;s hand improved to make a straight.

Mortensen won his second career bracelet at the 2003 World Series of Poker in the $5,000 Limit Hold&#x27;em event, earning $251,680. He defeated professional player Mark Gregorich heads-up to win the title.

At the 2006 World Series of Poker, Carlos made three final tables. He finished in ninth place in Event #2 (No Limit Hold&#x27;em) winning $71,617. He once again finished in ninth place in Event #6 (NL Hold &#x27;em), earning him $73,344. Mortensen came up just short of winning his third bracelet in Event #33 (Razz), where he finished runner-up to fellow professional James Richburg, earning him $94,908.

Mortensen finished in 10th place in the 2013 WSOP Main Event, being the &quot;Final Table Bubble Boy.&quot;

Mortensen was the last big-name poker professional to win the Main Event at the World Series of Poker, until Hossein Ensan in 2019. As a result of the poker boom, which ignited itself two years after his win, when Chris Moneymaker won the Main Event, the fields in that tournament have increased exponentially, making it extraordinarily more difficult for individual players to maintain consistent success in it.

==== World Series of Poker bracelets ====
=== World Poker Tour ===
In 2004, he won the World Poker Tour (WPT) Doyle Brunson North American Poker Championship for $1,000,000. Mortensen won the Season Five World Poker Tour championship event for a $3,970,415 first place prize, his largest tournament cash to date, and his second career WPT title, making him the first player in professional poker history to ever win the World Championship events at both the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour.

In 2010, Mortensen won the Season 8 WPT Hollywood Poker Open.

=== Other poker tournaments ===
Mortensen has made the prize money in the World Heads-Up Poker Championship, and was a semi-finalist in the second season of the Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament.

Mortensen had a good run at the 2007 European Poker Tour Main Event in Monte Carlo finishing 11th.

In 2006, he and his wife, fellow poker player Cecilia Reyes Mortensen, divorced.

As of August 2017, his total live tournament winnings exceed $12,100,000. His 21 cashes as the WSOP account for over $3,200,000 of those winnings.

<doc id="982058" wikidata="Q7590685" url="?curid=982058" title="St Michael's College, Tenbury">
<text>St Michael&#x27;s College (the College of St Michael and All Angels) at Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, England, was founded by Sir Frederick Ouseley in 1856 as a boys&#x27; preparatory school. Ouseley created the school to provide a model for the performance of Anglican church music. Choral services were performed daily in term time. The college possessed a library that contained rare books of international importance. Financial difficulties forced its closure in 1985.

The buildings were reopened as an independent international boarding school under the name of King&#x27;s College Saint Michael&#x27;s in 1990, before closing in June 2020 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2024, the site was bought by SIAS Education Group and Anglo Independence School. It is due to re-open as St Michael Abbey School in September 2025.

==History==
The school was founded in reaction to the decline of Anglican church music in the Victorian period. Ouseley sited it in a remote location so as to insulate it from the influence of London. Designed by architect Henry Woodyer, until its closure the school regularly sang 150 settings of evensong; it was the last educational establishment in England to sing the orders throughout the week. In the school chapel the choir is separated from the chancel by an ornate gilded screen topped by candles. The choir is backed by a &#x27;Father&#x27; Willis organ, painted with a representation of St Michael defeating the dragon.

Recordings of the choir are listed in the British Library Sound Archive and are available on CD in back catalogue editions. A recording of the final Evensong sung at the school in 1985 is found on the Archive of Recorded Church Music site

The school chapel is now the parish church for the surrounding village of St Michael&#x27;s which was created to support the creation of the school.

Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman spoke of the college, referring to:

&quot;……..the unique atmosphere of St. Michael’s College, Tenbury. I shall never forget my first impression of the place. There was the climb up from the little market town of Tenbury whence some of the lay clerks make their twice daily journey to Mattins and Evensong to lend men’s voices to the boys’ choir, and there before me stretched an enormous common. In the far corner, in a land of blossoming orchards and backed by the blue distance of Clee Hill, rose a chapel, seemingly as large as Lancing.

Attached to it were Warden’s house, school buildings, cloister and dining hall, all in a style of the fourteenth century, re-interpreted in local materials for the nineteenth century by architect, Henry Woodyer.

After Evensong, where the music was equal to that of the best cathedral choirs, and a walk round the buildings in the quiet of a Worcestershire evening, I visited the large dormitory, which runs almost the whole length of a building parallel with the chapel. Here Christopher Hassall read his poem to the boys and held them spellbound as the stars shone through the narrow Gothic windows in the gabled roof…………&quot;

The crest on the school tie was a red broadsword on a blue background symbolising St Michael&#x27;s defeat of the dragon by its colour and the two kinks in the sword.

===Musical library===
Supported by friends of Ouseley, the library contained such important articles as the original score of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; and Handel&#x27;s own conducting score from the Dublin premiere of &quot;Messiah&quot;. It was therefore a site of pilgrimage for musical scholars, including Benjamin Britten After the school&#x27;s closure the library was transferred to the Bodleian Library.

==More recent history of the buildings==
The year after the college closed the school buildings were used as the set for the 1986 film, &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; based on the novel by Jill Murphy, starring Diana Rigg, Tim Curry and Fairuza Balk.

From 1990 to 2020 the buildings were occupied by King’s Saint Michael’s College which was an international boarding school with students from many countries. It closed in 2020. That school specialised in providing education to international students by providing an intensive English language course alongside the traditional curriculum of GCSEs and A Levels. The school also ran a University Foundation Course. During the months of July and August, Saint Michael&#x27;s ran an English language summer school for students from around the world.

The buildings were bought in 2024. The newly formed St Michael’s Abbey School is expected to open for the 2025/26 school year.

<text>Wyszogród is a town in central Poland, in Masovian Voivodeship, in Płock County, by the Vistula River. The population of Wyszogród was 2,793 in 2004.

==History==

The settlement dates back to the 7th century, when there was a Slavic pagan temple at the site. In the 11th century Wyszogród became fortified and started to act as a local centre of commerce. In the 12th century it became the seat of local castellany and soon it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. Relocated on Magdeburg Law in 1398, Wyszogród became one of the most important inland ports and centres of textile production in the area. Brewing and crafts also developed. In the 16th century, King Sigismund II Augustus approved the statutes of the guilds of tailors and furriers, and Sigismund III Vasa issued new privileges for several guilds.

During the Deluge the town was pillaged and burnt by the Swedes. Several subsequent fires destroyed Wyszogród almost completely. During the Swedish invasion of Poland (1701–1706), Polish King Augustus II the Strong stayed in the town in 1704. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia. Prussia initiated German colonization and handed over the old Franciscan church to German Protestant colonists. The town also experienced an influx of Jews. In 1798 the Prussian administration dismantled the old castle of the Piast dynasty. In 1807 the town was reconquered by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw and after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815 it was transferred to so-called Congress Poland within the Russian Partition of Poland. During the January Uprising, on June 2, 1863, it was the site of a clash between Polish insurgents and Russian troops, won by the Poles. After World War I, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

During the Polish–Soviet War, in August 1920, Polish troops were stationed nearby to defend the crossing over the Vistula River against a possible Soviet attack.

During World War II, the town was heavily damaged during the course of the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. During the German occupation, Poles and Jews were brutalized in the town and conscripted for forced labor. In March 1941, around 120 Poles were expelled from the town, temporarily deported to a camp in Działdowo, where they were stripped of money and valuables, and afterwards deported to the General Government, while their houses were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Beginning in March 1941, Jews were deported to other ghettos and then on to Treblinka where they were murdered in October 1941 and to Auschwitz, where most were murdered in November 1942. During these deportations and the time spent in other ghettos, they suffered unimaginable horrors along with starvation and disease. These experiences of the Holocaust resulted in the deaths of all but 250 of Wyszogrod&#x27;s 2,700 Jews.

There were several Polish underground resistance groups operating both within the city and in the forests nearby. The town was rebuilt after the war, though its population did not recover to pre-war levels.

In 1997–1999 a bridge was built over the Vistula River, which was the longest bridge in Poland until the opening of the Solidarity Bridge in Płock in 2007.

==Sights==

<doc id="982072" wikidata="Q4585642" url="?curid=982072" title="Special Constabulary">
<text>The Special Constabulary is the part-time volunteer section of statutory police forces in the United Kingdom and some Crown dependencies. Its officers are known as special constables.

Every United Kingdom territorial police force has a special constabulary except the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which has a Reserve constituted on different grounds. However, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (and the previous Royal Irish Constabulary) did have its own Ulster Special Constabulary from 1920 until 1970, when the Reserve was formed. The British Transport Police (a national &quot;special police force&quot;) also has a special constabulary. In the Crown dependencies, the Isle of Man Constabulary and the States of Guernsey Police Service also have special constabularies, but the States of Jersey Police does not. Jersey has Honorary Police.

The strength of the special constabulary as of September 2018 in England and Wales was 11,343, -12.3% on the previous year. The number of special constables in Scotland in 2018 was 610. Special constables are not the same as police community support officers (PCSOs), who are employed by police forces to provide operational support to regular officers. Special constables usually work for a minimum number of hours per month (depending on the force – the national minimum is 16 hours), although many do considerably more. Special constables might receive some expenses and allowances from the police service, including a £1,100 &quot;recognition award&quot; in Scotland and some forces in England, but their work is in the main voluntary and unpaid.

Special constables have identical powers to their regular (full-time) colleagues and work alongside them, but most special constabularies in England and Wales have their own organisational structure and grading system, which varies from force to force. Special constabularies are headed by a chief officer. In Scotland, special constables have no separate administrative structure and grading system.

==History==
While the idea of a populace policing itself dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, with English common law requiring that all citizens have the legal obligation to come to the assistance of a police officer, it was not until 1673 that Charles II ruled that citizens may be temporarily sworn in as constables during times of public disorder. This ruling was in response to rising public disorder relating to enforcement of religious conformity, and any citizen refusing to acknowledge the call would have been subject to fines and jail sentences. The 1673 act was enforced for centuries after, mainly used to call up constables in the north of England.

Public disorder of that nature was renewed during the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, which was coupled with falling living standards and starvation. In 1819, mass meetings calling for parliamentary reform took place across England, including 60,000 demonstrators rioting in Manchester where a special constable was killed. In light of these events, in 1820, an Act was passed allowing magistrates to recruit men as special constables.

In 1831, Parliament passed &quot;An act for amending the laws relative to the appointment of Special Constables, and for the better preservation of the Police&quot;. This Act, forming the basis of special-constable principles to the modern day, and in particular allowed the formation of special constables outside of times of unrest, if the regular police force was deemed to be too small in a particular area. Specials were also granted full powers of arrest like their regular counterparts at this time, as well as weapons and equipment to carry out their duty.

A further act in 1835 redefined the Special Constabulary as a volunteer organisation, and expanded its jurisdiction. The constabulary was redefined for the last time into the organisation which exists today by the Special Constables Act 1914 just after the outbreak of World War I, during which they safeguarded water supplies from German infiltrators. During the Second World War, besides their normal duties, they were trained to deal with a range of eventualities such as first aid in case of injury, initial coordination of the security of aircraft crash sites, clearing people from the vicinity of unexploded bombs, handling of unignited incendiary bombs and checking compliance with lighting regulations.

==Application==

Requirements for being a special constable vary from force to force. The recruitment process in Scotland is also significantly different from the process in England and Wales. It can take from as few as six to as many as eighteen months from initial application through to attestation where recruits take the police oath. A number of different steps are involved in the recruitment process and the order can vary from force to force. The first part of the process usually involves completing an application form. After that, there may be a combination of entrance test (the Police Initial Recruitment Test in England and Wales or the Standard Entrance Test in Scotland), interview, security checks, fitness test and medical assessment although the exact process is force specific.

==Ranks==
There are currently a total of nine ranks currently in use across the special constabularies. Some of these ranks are rarely in use and special constabularies rarely use more than six ranks. The &quot;NPIA&quot; style rank insignia have a set of only seven ranks. There is no basis in law for ranks or grades for special constables. As such there is no equivalency of a regular police sergeant versus a special police sergeant for example. A special constable who is a higher rank or grade has no additional powers or opportunities in the same way as a regular officer. For example, a custody sergeant must be a regular police sergeant. A special inspector cannot authorise a section 18(1) PACE search and so on. In an operational setting, a special constable whatever their rank or grade has no formal authority over a regular officer in terms of supervision, although occasionally a very experienced senior special officer may informally temporarily oversee inexperienced regular officers. 

Only the Cheshire Special Constabulary and the Durham Special Constabulary use the special chief superintendent rank within the force.
Within the City of London Special Constabulary is the Honourable Artillery Company Specials, provided by the Honourable Artillery Company; members of this unit wear HAC on the shoulders in addition to other insignia.

===Insignia===
There is a large variation in the design of epaulettes used across Great Britain for special constables. This has been recognised at national level and as part of the Special Constabulary National Strategy 2018-2023 the structure and insignia is under review with the intention to standardise.

Special constabulary epaulettes frequently bear the letters &quot;SC&quot; (with or without a crown above) to differentiate them from regular officers. Senior special constables wear the same markings on their hats as equivalent regular ranks.

Other special constabularies use combinations of bars, half bars, pips, crowns, laurel wreaths, collar numbers, force crests and the SC identity (with or without a crown) to distinguish ranks (and/or role).
Northumbria Police and Police Scotland are the only forces to not have a rank structure, and special constables are line managed by regular sergeants. 

Northumbria Police plan to introduce a Special Sergeant rank to reduce the administrative burden on regular Response, Operations and Neighbourhood operational sergeants. 

Wiltshire Special Constabulary has special constable section leaders (SCSLs) strategically located around the county, but no other ranks.

Police Scotland plans to experiment with a limited management role in some divisions. 

==Uniform==

Special constables generally wear identical uniforms to their regular colleagues.
In some constabularies, their shoulder number may be prefixed with a certain digit or they may have additional insignia on their epaulettes which is usually a crown with the letters SC above or below it (although some forces just use the letters). Formerly, male special constables in English and Welsh forces did not wear helmets while on foot patrol but wore patrol caps instead, but in most forces they now do wear helmets. Some forces also issue special constables with a different hat badge from that of their regular counterparts although this is now extremely rare.

==Equipment==
Special constables all carry the same personal protective equipment (PPE) as their regular counterparts, such as handcuffs, batons, incapacitant spray (CS/PAVA spray), and protective vests.

The issuing of equipment varies from force to force with financial factors being the main reason behind the differences. In some forces protective vests, or body armour, may be personally issued to an officer, made to measure, however many other forces cannot afford this practice and instead the use of pool sets is prevalent.

The same practice is also seen with regard to radios: although many forces provide special constables with personal radios kept securely at their police station, other forces may only have pool sets. The management task is to ensure there are enough working pooled radios available in a command area to meet any &quot;surge&quot; need.

On 19 May 2022, Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that special constables would be able to carry tasers. Prior to this, special constables were not issued or trained to operate tasers. The British Transport Police became the first force to issues tasers to special constables on 27 May 2022, starting a group of 22. Whilst not lawfully excluded from doing so, specials do not carry firearms due to enhanced vetting and the training commitments required.

==Powers and jurisdiction==

===Territorial police forces===
The vast majority of special constables serve with one of the 45 territorial police forces in the United Kingdom. Depending on where they are attested, they have full police powers throughout one of three distinct legal systems - either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. This is identical to the jurisdiction granted to regular officers, although prior to 1 April 2007, special constables in England and Wales only had jurisdiction within their force area and any adjacent force areas. Recent changes have seen special constables enjoy the same cross-border powers as regular constables.

===British Transport Police===
Special constables of the British Transport Police have exactly the same powers and privileges as regular BTP constables, and the same cross-border powers. BTP special constables do not wear the distinctive &quot;SC&quot; insignia on their epaulettes. They work across England, Wales and Scotland and will often parade on at their home station and work 40 to 80 miles away from it.

==Duties==

As well as patrol duties, special constables often take part in response duties and specials often police events such as sports matches, carnivals, parades and fêtes. While this event policing is the stereotypical image of a special constable, it only represents one of the wide range of duties undertaken. Many police forces in England and Wales have introduced neighbourhood policing teams and the Special Constabulary has been incorporated into this concept.

=== Special operations ===

Many special constables have taken the opportunity to join specialist teams within their constabularies such as marine support, dog units and roads policing. Durham Constabulary, Warwickshire Police, West Mercia Police and Devon and Cornwall Police have for a number of years been training some of their specials to work with their road policing units (RPU); this has been expanded and some specials with Warwickshire and West Mercia are now working with their force&#x27;s criminal intercept team.

In 1995, special constables from Cheshire Police assisted officers from the Ministry of Defence Police with a surveillance operation at the former Royal Ordnance Factory at Radway Green near Crewe.

=== Public order ===

A number of special constables are trained in public order duties, including policing of football matches and demonstrations. In West Yorkshire Police, 24 specials have received Level 2 PSU (Police Support Unit) training, and have become part of the Operation Target team.

=== 2012 Olympics ===

There were plans for the Metropolitan Police to have up to 10,000 specials to help with security at the 2012 Olympic Games. This was to be done either through recruitment, with 700 extra specials being employed in the last year&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23667964-mayor-boris-to-flood-capital-with-olympic-army-of-10000-police-specials.do&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or by borrowing them from other forces.
While this idea would have created a much safer environment for the Olympic celebrations, the plans came under fire from the police federation, which said that &quot;volunteer special constables could drop out at the last minute, causing significant staffing problems&quot;. After the security firm G4S failed to hire enough security staff, the government called in 3,500 additional military personnel to cover the shortfall.

==Acceptance==

Historically, special constables were often looked down upon by regular officers and resented, as they were sometimes seen as &quot;hobby bobbies&quot; and not proper police officers. During the 1980s, specials were often considered to be preventing regular officers from earning overtime pay.

A sizeable proportion of regular officers have served as special constables before joining the regular force, which is encouraged by recruitment departments. Most police forces will accept applications from the age of 18; and the minimum age to commence training is 17 years 9 months in Essex Constabulary and 17 years 6 months for Humberside Police.

The Association of Special Constabulary Officers was established as a registered charity to represent special constables in relation to terms and conditions and representation at various Home Office and College of Policing boards. ASCO has also represented special constables for welfare issues and supported them as a &#x27;police friend&#x27; in misconduct cases.

Having previously not been allowed to join, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 now allows Special Constables to join the Police Federation. They are afforded the same representation as &quot;regulars&quot; and are eligible to become representatives, time and schedule permitting. They must also pay the same membership fee, currently £24 per month (Discounted 50% for the first year of service), despite being unpaid volunteers. This membership also allows them benefits such as &quot;Group Insurance&quot; and other associated perks of the Federation. Membership is not mandatory. 

==Honours, medals and awards==
Established by Royal Warrant on 30 August 1919, the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal may be earned by special constables after nine years&#x27; service, with a clasp issued for each additional period of 10 years. The name and rank of the recipient and the date of the award are engraved on the rim of the medal. The clasp includes the inscription &quot;THE GREAT WAR 1914 - 18&quot; for service as a special in The Great War or &quot;LONG SERVICE (year clasp was issued)&quot; for clasps earned for service after the war.

Special Constables are also eligible for other honours and a full list of honours can be found at the List of British Special Constables awarded honours with seven members of the Special Constabulary being awarded MBEs and BEMs in the 2019 New Year Honours. 

Special Constables are now eligible to receive the King&#x27;s Police Medal. On 11 March 2022 HM Queen Elizabeth II approved amendments to the Royal Warrant to expressly state that members of the Special Constabulary in England and Wales were eligible for the medal, with members of the Special Constabulary in Scotland already eligible.

The Lord Ferrers&#x27; Awards recognise outstanding contributions to volunteering in policing. The awards, previously known as the Special Constable and Police Support Volunteer Awards, highlight the vital role volunteers play in support of policing, by giving up their free time to make communities safer, and enhancing the effectiveness of policing across England and Wales. In 2013, they were renamed in memory of Rt Hon Lord Ferrers, the former Home Office minister who created the awards in 1993.

<doc id="982081" wikidata="Q908998" url="?curid=982081" title="Dooley Wilson">
<text>Arthur &quot;Dooley&quot; Wilson (April 3, 1886 – May 30, 1953) was an American actor, singer and musician who is best remembered for his portrayal of Sam in the 1942 film &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In that romantic drama, he performs its theme song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;.

Wilson was a drummer and singer who led his own band in the 1920s, touring nightclubs in London and Paris. In the 1930s he took up acting, playing supporting roles onstage on Broadway and in a series of modest films. His role in &quot;Casablanca&quot; was by far his most prominent, but his other films included &quot;My Favorite Blonde&quot; (1942) with Bob Hope, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943) with Lena Horne and the Nicholas Brothers, and the Western &quot;Passage West&quot; (1951).

==Early life and career==
Arthur Wilson was born in Tyler, Texas, the youngest of five children. At age seven, the year of his father&#x27;s death, he began to earn a living by performing in churches in Tyler. When he was eight years old he was earning $18 a week, singing and playing in tent shows. By 1908 he was in Chicago in the repertory company of the Pekin Theatre, the first legitimate black theatre in the United States. By then he had earned the nickname &quot;Dooley&quot;, for his whiteface impersonation of an Irishman singing a song called &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot;.
Part of the emerging African American theatre scene, Wilson worked with the Anita Bush company in New York City in 1914 and with Charles Gilpin&#x27;s stock company at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem in 1915. He performed in James Reese Europe&#x27;s band, and after World War I he toured Europe with his own band, The Red Devils, throughout the 1920s.
Working in the U.S. again during the Great Depression, Wilson starred in Rudolph Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Conjur&#x27; Man Dies&quot; (1936) and other plays for the Federal Theatre Project&#x27;s Negro Theatre Unit, then under the direction of John Houseman. His breakthrough role came in 1940, with his portrayal of Little Joe in the Broadway musical &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;. This won him a contract with Paramount Pictures in Hollywood. He found himself playing Pullman porters while his stage role in the MGM film adaptation of &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; was played by Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson.

==&quot;Casablanca&quot;==
In May 1942, Warner Bros. was casting its production of &quot;Casablanca&quot; and borrowed Wilson from Paramount Pictures for seven weeks at $500 a week. Per the studio custom of the day, Wilson received his contract salary, $350 per week, and Paramount kept the balance.

Wilson was cast in the role of Sam, a singer and pianist employed by nightclub owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart). Wilson performs the Herman Hupfeld song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, a continuing musical and emotional motif throughout the film. According to Aljean Harmetz, &quot;Variety&quot; singled out Wilson for the effectiveness of the song, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said he created &quot;something joyous&quot;. The phrase &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;, commonly believed to be a quote from the film, is in fact never heard; the line is, &quot;Play it, once, Sam.&quot; In the film, Wilson as Sam performs several other songs for the cafe audience: &quot;It Had To Be You&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot;.

Wilson was a singer and drummer, but not a pianist. The piano music for the film was played off-screen, either by Elliot Carpenter or Jean Plummer, and dubbed.

==Later life and career==
Wilson was cast in the film version of &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), as Gabe Tucker, the best friend of Bill Williamson (Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson). It was the second all-black cast motion picture made by a major studio in the 1940s, after &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;.
Back on Broadway, Wilson played Pompey, an escaped slave, in the musical &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; (1944–46). His performance of the song &quot;The Eagle and Me&quot; in this show was selected by Dwight Blocker Bowers for inclusion in a Smithsonian recordings compilation, &quot;American Musical Theatre.&quot; Later, Wilson played the role of Bill Jackson on the television situation comedy &quot;Beulah&quot; during its 1951–52 season. Wilson was on the executive board of the Negro Actors Guild of America.

==Death and legacy==
Wilson died May 30, 1953, of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles. He had become ill two years earlier while performing in a New York stage production of &quot;Harvey&quot;.

In January 2017, Wilson&#x27;s hometown of Tyler, Texas dedicated a memorial marker to him on its &quot;Half Mile of History&quot;.

<text>Paul Bowman Popenoe (October 16, 1888 – June 19, 1979) was an American marriage counselor, eugenicist and agricultural explorer. He was an influential advocate of the compulsory sterilization of mentally ill people and people with mental disabilities, and the father of marriage counseling in the United States.

==Personal life==
Born Paul Bowman Popenoe in Topeka, Kansas, in 1888, he was the son of Marion Bowman Popenoe and Frederick Oliver Popenoe, a pioneer of the avocado industry. (Popenoe dropped his middle name early in life.) He moved to California as a teen. After attending Occidental College for two years and Stanford University for his junior year majoring in English with coursework in biology, Popenoe left school to care for his father and worked for several years as a newspaper editor. 

Popenoe married Betty Stankowitch in New York on 23 August 1920. They remained married until her death on 26 June 1978. He died less than a year later, on 19 June 1979 in Miami, Florida, at the age of 90.

The youngest of Paul Popenoe&#x27;s four sons, David Popenoe, became a sociology professor who was a prominent advocate for &quot;rebuilding a marriage culture&quot; and reviving the &quot;married-parent nuclear family.&quot;

==Biology and eugenics==

Popenoe worked briefly as an agricultural explorer collecting date specimens in Western Asia and Northern Africa for his father&#x27;s nursery in California, along with his younger brother, Wilson Popenoe, a horticulturist. His travels received considerable support and interest from the US Department of Agriculture. Paul Popenoe published his first book, &quot;Date Growing in the Old World and the New&quot;, in 1913.

In the mid-1910s, Popenoe became interested in human breeding and edited the &quot;Journal of Heredity&quot; from 1913 to 1917, with a special attention to eugenics and social hygiene.

By 1918, Popenoe had become well-established enough to co-author (with Roswell Hill Johnson) a popular college textbook on eugenics (&quot;Applied Eugenics&quot;, edited by Richard T. Ely), which outlined his vision of a eugenics program that primarily relied on the segregation of &quot;waste humanity&quot; into rural institutions, where they would perform manual labor to offset the cost of their institutionalization. He opposed child labor because he believed that people whom he regarded as unfit members of society would have fewer children if their children were not allowed to work. Additionally, &quot;Applied Eugenics&quot; contains a chapter expounding on Popenoe&#x27;s belief in the racial inferiority of black people. During World War I, Popenoe was inducted into the officer corps of the US Army. Under the War Department Commission on Training Camp Activities, he was charged with rooting out liquor and prostitution in an effort to reduce the high incidence of venereal disease in US troops.

In the mid-1920s, Popenoe began working with E.S. Gosney, a wealthy California financier, and the Human Betterment Foundation to promote eugenic policies in California. In 1909, California had enacted its first compulsory sterilization law to allow for the sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded in its state psychiatric hospitals. With Popenoe as his scientific workhorse, Gosney intended to study the sterilization work done in California and to use it to advocate sterilization in other parts of the country and in the world at large. That would culminate in a number of works, most prominently their joint-authored &quot;Sterilization for Human Betterment: A Summary of Results of 6,000 Operations in California, 1909-1929&quot; in 1929. The work would become a popular text for the advocacy of sterilization, as it purported to be an objective study of the operations in the state and concluded, unsurprisingly, that rigorous programs for the sterilization of the &quot;unfit&quot; were beneficial to all involved, including the sterilized patients. In the 1930s, he served as a member of the American Eugenics Society&#x27;s board of directors, along with Charles B. Davenport, Henry H. Goddard, Madison Grant, Harry H. Laughlin, and Gosney, among others.

In 1929, he received an honorary Sc.D. degree from Occidental College, which he had attended. Thenceforth, he commonly referred to himself as &quot;Dr. Popenoe&quot;. In 1976, Popenoe also received the Auld Lang Syne award from Occidental. However, on April 26, 2019, Occidental rescinded the honorary Sc.D. degree after a unanimous vote of its board of trustees. Leading up to that vote, Occidental Professor Peter Dreier wrote an opinion article in March 2019 about the college&#x27;s historical role in eugenics and racism, and 86 percent of the college&#x27;s faculty then signed a statement urging the board to revoke the degree granted to Popenoe 90 years earlier.

==Marriage and family counseling==
Along with his advocacy of sterilization programs, Popenoe was also interested in using the principles of German and Austrian marriage consultation services for eugenic purposes. Aghast at the divorce rate in US society, Popenoe came to the conclusion that &quot;unfit&quot; families would reproduce out of wedlock, but &quot;fit&quot; families would need to be married to reproduce. With financial help from Gosney, he opened the American Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles in 1930. It was described in 1960 as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and best known marriage-counseling center,&quot; with a staff of seventy.
For a while, Popenoe&#x27;s two major interests, eugenics and marriage counseling, ran in parallel, and he published extensively on both topics. As public interest in eugenics waned, Popenoe focused more of his energies into marriage counseling and during public rejection of eugenics at the end of World War II, with the revelation of the Nazi Holocaust, Popenoe had thoroughly redefined himself as primarily a marriage counselor, which had lost most of its explicit eugenic overtones. Over time, he became more prominent in the field of counseling.

Popenoe favored a popular, rather than academic, approach. In that vein, he appeared on the Art Linkletter television show for over a decade, and he regularly gave lectures and wrote mainstream articles for the general public. For many years, he had a nationally syndicated newspaper column promoting marriage and family life. As presented in a 1960 biography, the focus areas of his counseling approach and the American Institute of Family Relations included couples&#x27; attitudes towards marriage, preparation (including sexuality education), moral values, a focus on action, and mutual understanding between the sexes.

At the peak of his career, he co-founded and edited &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; most popular column of all time, &quot;Can This Marriage Be Saved?&quot; In 1960, he co-authored (with Dorothy Disney) the book of the same name. His introduction to the book catalogued some of the statistics of the American Institute of Family Relations over its first 30 years. Under his direction, the institute gave intensive training to over 300 marriage counselors and shorter courses around the US to over 1500 other people. The caseload averaged about 15,000 consultations per year. From the files of the numerous cases came the material for the &quot;Can This Marriage Be Saved?&quot; book and serial. The institute published a bulletin, &quot;Family Life,&quot; monthly or bimonthly for decades.

Given the role of clergy in responding to crisis in families, Popenoe increased focus in training the clergy over many years. That culminated in 1978 with the American Institute of Family Relations creating the Pastoral Psychotherapy Training Program, which offered the Master of Arts in Pastoral Psychotherapy. It was the second offering of a master&#x27;s degree by the institute.

As Popenoe maintained his traditional values (chastity before marriage), changes in popular culture such as feminism and sexual revolution challenged his approach. At the same time, thought leaders in the helping professions tended more and more to favor self-fulfillment over preservation of the family. That led Popenoe to ally increasingly with religious conservatives even though he was not religious himself. For example, one of his assistants was James Dobson, who founded Focus on the Family in 1977. In the US society of the third millennium, the approach Popenoe developed to marriage counseling, educational and directive rather than medical or psychological, is becoming fashionable again. In the end, the American Institute of Family Relations turned out to be highly dependent on Popenoe&#x27;s leadership. It closed in the 1980s, not long after Paul Popenoe&#x27;s death.

==Archives==
Shortly before his death, Popenoe transferred his papers to the University of Wyoming. In 2002, the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming reported the collection Paul Bowman Popenoe Papers, 1874–1991, consisting of 85 cubic feet of material. The archives of the Human Betterment Foundation are in Special Collections at Caltech in Pasadena.

<text>A resettable fuse or polymeric positive temperature coefficient device (PPTC) is a passive electronic component used to protect against overcurrent faults in electronic circuits. The device is also known as a multifuse or polyfuse or polyswitch. They are similar in function to PTC thermistors in certain situations but operate on mechanical changes instead of charge carrier effects in semiconductors. These devices were first discovered and described by Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs in 1939 and described in US patent #2,258,958.

==Operation==
A polymeric PTC device is made up of a non-conductive crystalline organic polymer matrix that is loaded with carbon black particles to make it conductive. While cold, the polymer is in a crystalline state, with the carbon forced into the regions between crystals, forming many conductive chains. Since it is conductive (the &quot;initial resistance&quot;), it will pass a current. If too much current is passed through the device, the device will begin to heat. As the device heats, the polymer will expand, changing from a crystalline into an amorphous state. The expansion separates the carbon particles and breaks the conductive pathways, causing the device to heat faster and expand more, further raising the resistance. This increase in resistance substantially reduces the current in the circuit. A small (leakage) current still flows through the device and is sufficient to maintain the temperature at a level which will keep it in the high resistance state. Leakage current can range from less than a hundred mA at rated voltage up to a few hundred mA at lower voltages. The device can be said to have latching functionality. The hold current is the maximum current at which the device is guaranteed not to trip. The trip current is the current at which the device is guaranteed to trip.

When power is removed, the heating due to the leakage current will stop and the PPTC device will cool. As the device cools, it regains its original crystalline structure and returns to a low resistance state where it can hold the current as specified for the device. This cooling usually takes a few seconds, though a tripped device will retain a slightly higher resistance for hours, unless the power in it is weaker, or has been often used, slowly approaching the initial resistance value. The resetting will often not take place even if the fault alone has been removed with the power still flowing as the operating current may be above the holding current of the PPTC. The device may not return to its original resistance value; it will most likely stabilize at a significantly higher resistance (up to 4 times initial value). It could take hours, days, weeks or even years for the device to return to a resistance value similar to its original value, if at all.

A PPTC device has a current rating and a voltage rating.

==Applications==
These devices are often used in computer power supplies, largely due to the PC 97 standard (which recommends a sealed PC that the user never has to open), and in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult. Another application for such devices is protecting audio loudspeakers, particularly tweeters, from damage when over driven: by putting a resistor or light bulb in parallel with the PPTC device it is possible to design a circuit that limits total current through the tweeter to a safe value instead of cutting it off, allowing the speaker to continue operating without damage when the amplifier is delivering more power than the tweeter could tolerate. While a fuse could also offer similar protection, if the fuse is blown, the tweeter cannot operate until the fuse is replaced.

<doc id="982096" wikidata="Q139798" url="?curid=982096" title="Seleucus of Seleucia">
<text>Seleucus of Seleucia ( &quot;Seleukos&quot;; born c. 190 BC; fl. c. 150 BC) was a Hellenistic astronomer and philosopher. Coming from Seleucia on the Tigris, Mesopotamia, the capital of the Seleucid Empire, or, alternatively, Seleukia on the Erythraean Sea, he is best known as a proponent of heliocentrism and for his theory of the causes of tides.

==Heliocentric theory==
Seleucus is known to have supported the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus of Samos, which stated that the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun. According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to demonstrate the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. According to Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, Seleucus may have constructed his heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, as Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. He may have used trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus.

Since the time of Heraclides Ponticus (387 BC–312 BC), the inferior planets Mercury and Venus have been at times named &quot;solar planets&quot;, as their positions diverge from the Sun by only a small angle.

According to the Greek geographer Strabo, Seleucus was also the first to assume the universe to be infinite. None of his original writings have survived, though a fragment of his work has survived only in Arabic translation, which was later referred to by the Persian philosopher Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865–925).

==Tides==

According to Lucio Russo, Seleucus&#x27; arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. The annual cycle of tides (which was studied by Seleucus) can indeed hardly be explained in a geocentric system. Seleucus correctly theorized that tides were caused by the Moon, explaining that the interaction was mediated by the pneuma. He noted that the tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to Russo, Seleucus ascribed tides both to the Moon and to a whirling motion of the Earth, which could be interpreted as the motion of the Earth around the Earth-Moon center of mass.

According to Strabo (3.5.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon&#x27;s position relative to the Sun.

==Seleucus in Strabo==
Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch, Aetius, and Strabo, all of whom were Greeks, and the Persian Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi. Strabo lists Seleucus as one of the four most influential &quot;Chaldean&quot; astronomers:
In Chapter XVI of his Geographia, Strabo mentions several &quot;Chaldaen&quot; astronomers. At the end he adds: &quot;Seleukios of Seleukia was a Chaldaean too.&quot; ... Babylonian astrologers and astronomers were often called &quot;Chaldaeans.&quot; Strabo calls them &quot;the so-called Chaldaeans&quot;. Their writings were translated into Greek and used by later authors like Geminos. The &quot;Chaldaean&quot; astronomers mentioned by Strabo are Kidenas, Naburianos, Sudines, and Seleukos. The first two are also known from astronomical cuneiform texts under their Akkadian names Nabu-Rimannu and Kidinnu.

<text>Whitley Bay Football Club, also known as The Seahorses, or simply The Bay, are an English football club based in the seaside town of Whitley Bay, in the North East county of Tyne and Wear. Initially founded as Whitley &amp; Monkseaton Football Club in 1897, the club took its present name in 1958. The team plays its home matches at Hillheads Park, which is adjacent to the Whitley Bay Ice Rink and has a maximum capacity of 4,500.

Since 1958 the club has spent the vast majority of seasons in the Northern Football League&#x27;s Division One. The Seahorses first competed in the division for 30 years between 1958 and 1988, before rejoining for the 2000–01 season, where they have been ever since.

Whitley Bay are the most successful club in FA Vase history, the national cup competition for more than 600 teams in the 9th and 10th tier of English football. They have won the competition a record four times, including three consecutive victories at Wembley Stadium in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The club has also won twelve Northumberland Senior Cups, three Northern Football League championships, and a Northern Premier League Division One title.

==History==
=== Origins; formation and early years (1896–1958) ===

A football club has existed in Whitley Bay since 1896. The first team was known as Whitley and Monkseaton F.C; later renamed Monkseaton FC and then again to Whitley Bay Athletic in 1950. In 1958 a limited company was formed, with &#x27;Athletic&#x27; dropped from the title.

From 1950 until 1955, Whitley Bay Athletic were members of the Northern Alliance League, winning the League Championship, League Cup (twice), and in 1952–53 became the first amateur team to win the Northumberland Senior Cup in sixty years, beating rivals North Shields in front of 17,000 fans inside St James&#x27; Park.

In 1955, The Seahorses briefly joined the North Eastern League wholly made up of professional sides,

=== First appearance in the Northern Football League (1958–1988) ===

==== Initial success (1958–1973) ====
Whitley Bay was elected to the Northern League by a winning vote of 11–3 on 14 June 1958. It was here that the club won two league titles (in 1964–65 and 1965–66) and two Northern League Cups (in 1964–65 and 1970–71). In addition, the Northumberland Senior Cup was won eight times in twelve years between 1961–1973.

In the FA Amateur Cup (the predecessor to the FA Vase), The Bay twice reached the semi-finals, and quadrice the quarter-finals; A 1965 quarter-final appearance of which holds the club record attendance (7,301) in a 3–1 loss to Hendon.

On 18 March 1968, floodlights were installed around Hillheads Park; marked by a friendly match against Newcastle United.

==== Decline and then recovery (1973–1988) ====

Fortunes began to fade from the mid-1970s before having to re-apply to the Northern League as a result of coming last in the 1979–80 campaign. Success remained limited in the aftermath of re-election, with successive finishes of 19th, 19th, 13th, and 9th—during the early 1980s.

Former player, Bobby Graham, was appointed first team manager in 1986. Graham&#x27;s first season marked Whitley Bay&#x27;s highest league position in 15 years (5th), their best-ever FA Trophy campaign (reaching the final sixteen) and their first Northumberland Senior Cup since 1973 (beating Newcastle Blue Star, 2–1, in the final at Hillheads Park). The team then sustained a title challenge for the majority of the following season before finishing 4th in midst of numerous injuries.

=== Northern Premier League members (1988–2000) ===

==== Division One (1988–1991) ====
Whitley Bay left the Northern Football League after 30 successive years in the division, applying for promotion to the second tier of the Northern Premier League (NPL) at the end of the 1987–88 season.

In their debut season in the NPL Division One, The Seahorses finished 5th. The team then followed it up with 4th place the season after, in a campaign that also saw them record their best–ever FA Cup run, when they reached the Third Round Proper, beating Scarborough of the fourth tier and Preston North End of the third, before losing 1–0 to Rochdale. In only their third season, Whitley Bay became champions of the Northern Premier League Division One, gaining promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division.

==== Premier Division (1991–1995) ====
Whitley Bay only spent four seasons at the club&#x27;s zenith. 17th in both the first and second season, the highest-ever final league position to date of 11th in the third, before 21st place relegation in the fourth sent the club back to Northern Premier League Division One

==== Division One (1995–2000) ====
Following relegation at the end of the 1994–95 season, Whitley Bay returned to the NPL Division One, finishing 8th in their first season back. The Seahorses then followed it up with 12th in the second season, 13th in the third, and 19th in the fourth. The Bay then finished 22nd and bottom in 1999–2000, being relegated back to the Northern Football League.

=== Return to the Northern Football League (2000–present) ===
Following a second relegation in six seasons in 1999–2000, Whitley Bay returned to Northern Football League Division One after a 12-year absence.

In 2005, Whitley Bay ended an 18-year barren run without a Northumberland Senior Cup title.

The Bay won their third-ever Northern League title in 2006–07, 41 years on from their back–to–back titles in 1964–65 and 1965–66, however they did not apply for promotion.

In 2010, The Seahorses won a twelfth Northumberland Senior Cup.

==== Three appearances at Wembley Stadium and four FA Vase trophies ====
Whitley Bay first won the FA Vase at Villa Park in 2001–02. The Seahorses then maintained a 100% record in finals as they went on to win three consecutive trophies at the new Wembley Stadium in 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2010–11, becoming the competition&#x27;s most successful club both in the total number of titles and most won consecutively.

<doc id="982102" wikidata="Q4426710" url="?curid=982102" title="European Union Association Agreement">
<text>A European Union Association Agreement or simply Association Agreement (AA) is a treaty between the European Union (EU, or its predecessors), its Member States and a non-EU country or bloc of countries that governs bilateral relations. Areas frequently covered by such agreements include the development of political, trade, social, cultural and security links. The provision for an association agreement was included in the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, as a means to enable co-operation of the Community with the United Kingdom, which had retreated from the treaty negotiations at the Messina Conference of 1955. According to the European External Action Service, for an agreement to be classified as an AA, it must meet several criteria:

The EU typically concludes Association Agreements in exchange for commitments to political, economic, trade, or human rights reform in a country. In exchange, the country may be offered tariff-free access to some or all EU markets (industrial goods, agricultural products, etc.), and financial or technical assistance. Most recently signed AAs also include a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and the external party.

Association Agreements have to be accepted by the European Union and need to be ratified by all the EU member states and the state concerned.

==Names and types==
AAs go by a variety of names (e.g. Euro-Mediterranean Agreement Establishing an Association, Europe Agreement Establishing an Association) and need not necessarily even have the word &quot;Association&quot; in the title. Some AAs contain a promise of future EU membership for the contracting state.

The first states to sign such agreements were Greece in 1961 and Turkey in 1963.

In recent history, such agreements have been signed as part of two EU policies, the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAp) and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).

The countries of the western Balkans (official candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and potential candidate Kosovo) are covered by SAp. All six have &quot;Stabilisation and Association Agreements&quot; (SAA) with the EU in force.

The Eastern European neighbours of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are all members of the Eastern Partnership and are covered by the ENP. While Russia has a special status with the EU-Russia Common Spaces instead of ENP participation.

Meanwhile, the countries of the Mediterranean, (Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia) are also covered by the ENP and seven of the Mediterranean states have a &quot;Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association&quot; (EMAA) with the EU in force, while Palestine has an interim EMAA in force. Syria initialed an EMAA in 2008, however signing has been deferred indefinitely. Negotiations for a Framework Agreement with the remaining state, Libya, have been suspended.

Moldova and Ukraine have Association Agreements in force. Armenia completed negotiations for a AA in 2013 but decided not to sign the agreement and later signed a revised CEPA with the EU in 2017. Azerbaijan was also negotiating an AA, but did not conclude one.

Both the SAA and ENP are based mostly on the EU&#x27;s acquis communautaire and its promulgation in the co-operating states legislation. Of course, the depth of the harmonisation is less than full EU members and some policy areas may not be covered (depending on the particular state).

In addition to these two policies, AAs with free-trade agreement provisions have been signed with other states and trade blocs including Chile and South Africa.

==Impact on environment and national economies==
===Agriculture &amp; Manufacturing===
Trade agreements between the EU and other countries or free trade zones have differential effects on the respective economies. Agricultural industries are most significantly impacted when regional farms have to compete with large producers that gain access to markets when tariffs fall. For large agreements such as the AA with Mercosur, significant opposition exists in European countries against cheaper imports of meats and other products. However, for the manufacturing sector of cars and industrial products for export, usually involving larger global corporations, relevant volume increases are obvious for the more industrialised trade members.

===Environment=== 
The impact on the environment for those nations that export farm products from areas with rain forests or other ecologically relevant regions, for example in Brazil, has been increasingly documented by environmental groups opposing EU trade agreements. In addition, other industries with large environmental impact such as mining are expanding in areas where the regulatory burden is low, for example in South America and Asia. Industry groups have argued that increased economic performance in those sectors will only strengthen standards in participating nations, and that EU trade agreements should go hand in hand with harmonisation efforts for environmental regulations.

<text>Principal photography is the phase of producing a film or television show in which the bulk of shooting takes place, as distinct from the phases of pre-production and post-production.

== Personnel ==
Besides the main film personnel, such as actors, director, cinematographer or sound engineer and their respective assistants (assistant director, camera assistant, boom operator), the unit production manager plays a decisive role in principal photography. They are responsible for the daily implementation of the shoot, managing the daily call sheet, the location barriers, transportation, and catering. Additional typical roles during filming include the script supervisor to record changes to the script and the still photographer to produce images for advertising and documentation.

Several reports are prepared each day to track the progress of a film production, including the daily production report, the daily progress report, and the sound report.

== Process ==
=== Preparation ===
Principal photography can take place in a studio or in an actual setting, and the choice of location depends on artistic and economic aspects. While shooting in a sound stage offers more accurate planning, constructing sets may be expensive. Costs and artistic reasons (see French New Wave and Dogme 95) are the main drives behind filming on location. However, outdoor shooting requires more effort because equipment and personnel must be transported to the location. In the early days of cinema, filmmakers tried to film outdoors as much as possible, as sunlight was needed to ensure adequate exposure of poor-quality early film stock; nowadays, due to the increased use of CGI, more shooting is done in a studio.

Depending on the laws of the respective country, the producer must obtain filming permits from private individuals, authorities or companies for the selected locations before filming begins. An extensive production may require closing the area with signs and diversions. A filming permit within an urban area usually requires a fee, which depends on the complexity and scope of the filming as well as the attractiveness of the location.

Once the locations have been set, the screenplay is summarized in a script breakdown with all information relevant to the shooting. Under the supervision of the producer, the unit production manager prepares the production schedule, production board, and shooting schedule to work out the exact sequence in which the scenes in the script will be shot. Due to a great many considerations beyond the scope of this article (but addressed at length in the production board article), the sequence of the scenes to be shot normally does not follow their chronological sequence in the script. These schedules are then used to build the daily call sheets, which summarize the relevant information from the schedule and lists exactly who has to be on the set for a planned daily shoot. At the same time, the call sheets provides information about the scene numbers, script pages and locations relevant for each day, as well as the necessary equipment.

Feature films usually have insurance in place by the time principal photography begins. The death of a bankable star before completing all planned takes or the loss of sets or footage can render a film impossible to complete as planned. Furthermore, professional quality movie cameras are usually rented as needed, and most camera houses do not allow rentals of their equipment without proof of insurance.

All this meticulous planning is necessary because time equals money. Every hour spent on set resolving issues which could have been resolved earlier—while the cast and crew wait for filming to resume—equals thousands of dollars which will need to come out of some other portion of the film&#x27;s budget. As of 2012, the average &quot;day cost&quot; for an American film ranged from as low as $25,000 for low-budget films, to $35,000-$60,000 for midlevel budget films, to as high as $100,000-$250,000 for blockbuster films. The first assistant director is paid very well to keep filming on schedule and within the original budget, and may be replaced (that is, fired) if the production strays too far from its original schedule and budget.

=== Main shooting ===
Principal photography is typically the most expensive phase of film production, due to actor, director, and set crew salaries, as well as the costs of certain shots, props, and on-set special effects. When filming begins, the preparation time is over: the final version of the script is done, the cast has been selected, and the buildings and structures on set have largely been completed. The start of filming generally marks a point of no return for the financiers, because until it is complete, there is unlikely to be enough material filmed to release a final product needed to recoup costs. While it is common for a film to lose its greenlight status during the pre-production phase – for example, when an essential cast member drops out or unexpectedly dies, or some scandal engulfs the studio or an actor – it is rare for a film to lose financing once principal photography has begun.

Immediately before a take is shot, the scene is rehearsed with camera, light and sound. Most American productions follow a specific procedure:

The assistant director (AD) calls &quot;picture is up!&quot; to inform everyone that a take is about to be recorded, and then &quot;quiet, everyone!&quot; Once everyone is ready to shoot, the AD calls &quot;roll sound&quot; (if the take involves sound), and the production sound mixer will start their equipment, record a verbal slate of the take&#x27;s information, and announce &quot;sound speed&quot;, or just &quot;speed&quot;, when they are ready. The AD follows with &quot;roll camera&quot;, answered by &quot;speed!&quot; by the camera operator once the camera is recording. The clapper, who is already in front of the camera with the clapperboard, calls &quot;marker!&quot; and slaps it shut. If the take involves extras or background action, the AD will cue them (&quot;action background!&quot;), and last is the director, telling the actors &quot;action!&quot;. The AD may echo &quot;action&quot; louder on large sets.

A take is over when the director calls &quot;Cut!&quot; and the camera and sound stop recording. The ritual helps the general concentration at the location and allows saving costs by only recording the scene rather than the preparation for the scene. Each shot is repeated until the director is satisfied with it.

In addition to the actual film crew that does the principal photography (unit), there may be a second team (second unit), which in turn comprises a full film crew with its own director, especially for more complex productions. The second unit works independently but in coordination with the director of the overall project and is responsible for city and landscape shots, establishing shots and intermediate images as well as for mass, action and stunt scenes.

The length of the filming depends not only on the length of the film, but also on the number and type of locations. The shooting time for a 90-minute film in Europe is 12 to 100 days. In the USA, depending on the film project, a shooting time of 15 to 20, 40 to 50 or, for larger productions, 80 to 100 days is used as a basis for studio productions, although in other countries the shooting takes considerably longer. Because of breaks in recording and subsequent shoots that are difficult to calculate, the principal photography is usually planned longer than actually necessary.

Once a film concludes principal photography, it is said to have wrapped, and a wrap party may be organized to celebrate. During post-production, it may become apparent that some shots or sequences are missing or incomplete and are required to complete the film, or that a particular scene is not playing as expected, or that a performer needs to be replaced entirely. In these circumstances, additional material may have to be shot.

=== Follow-ups ===
When using analog cameras, the exposed photographic film from a day of shooting is rushed to a photographic processing lab for development overnight, and then the developed raw footage is viewed by the director, cinematographer and producer the next day to determine whether reshooting is needed. With digital cameras, the so-called dailies can be viewed immediately after they are recorded. If the material proves to be inadequate or faulty, a re-shoot will be carried out on the day of shooting (digital) or on the day of the viewing (analog).

Sometimes, additional shooting is needed after principal photography is complete, because the shots already made have subsequently turned out to be unusable or additional shots are required. For example, serious deficiencies in the narrative structure may become clear only after filming (such as when a rough cut of the film is put through test screenings with audiences who have not had the benefit of reading the screenplay in advance). Other reasons for re-shoots may be the production company&#x27;s desire to make the film more commercially appealing, or the replacement of actors whose performance was lacking or who no longer fit the project after significant revisions to the film&#x27;s plot or tone.

If the new material has already been shot once or is substantial, this process is referred to as a re-shoot. However, if the material is new and relatively minor, it is often referred to as a pick-up.

<text>Ho Ho Ho, also known as VH-1 Presents RuPaul: Ho Ho Ho, is a Christmas album and the third studio album by American singer and drag queen RuPaul. Released on October 28, 1997, by the record label Rhino, it is RuPaul&#x27;s first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to his 1996 album &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;. RuPaul co-produced the album with Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato from the production company World of Wonder. &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; consists of thirteen tracks, including ten covers of Christmas standards and carols, and three original songs written by Joe Carrano and RuPaul. Music critics frequently described the album as an example of camp though RuPaul clarified that it included several more serious covers, specifically &quot;All Alone on Christmas&quot; and &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot;.

&quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; was praised by critics following its release and during retrospective reviews; its cheerful and humorous compositions were frequently cited as the album&#x27;s highlights, though some commentators responded negatively to the record&#x27;s use of humor and the lack of clarity in its overall message. It was included in a 2016 parody list discussing the alt-right, the &quot;War on Christmas&quot;, and the bathroom bill. The album peaked at number 27 on the Heatseekers Albums &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, selling a little more than 4,000 copies in one week. To support the record, RuPaul filmed a television special as part of his VH1 talk show &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot;.

== Recording and release ==
&quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; was recorded in RuPaul&#x27;s living room in New York City; it was completed over the span of three days in July 1997. RuPaul attributed the album&#x27;s success to his chemistry with American singer Michelle Visage, saying: &quot;You can hear us having a good time. So whether it was a Hanukkah album or a Kwanzaa album, it didn&#x27;t make a difference, because the chemistry is there.&quot; RuPaul and Visage interpreted Christmas songs as examples of camp while describing them as still holding clear messages; RuPaul explained: &quot;Even the camp stuff still holds the true meaning of Christmas, the sweetness and the love about another year gone by.&quot; The album&#x27;s record label Rhino executive promoted the album through the tagline: &quot;Celebrate Christmas with classic holiday songs and camp, RuPaul style!&quot;

&quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; was made available on October 28, 1997, by Rhino on cassette and CD. It was rereleased as a digital download in 2009 through Rhino and Tommy Boy Records. The album was also known as &quot;VH-1 Presents RuPaul: Ho Ho Ho&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; was issued on vinyl, and a deluxe edition, which included RuPaul&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; and four remixes, was released on streaming services. RuPaul promoted the record by headlining a 1997 Christmas special as a part of his VH1 talk show &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot;. 

In the United States, &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; reached a peak position of number 27 on the Heatseekers Albums &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, and remained on the chart for two weeks. It sold a little more than 4,000 copies in one week. The remix of &quot;Celebrate&quot; peaked at number 31 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart on October 11, 1997, and remained on the chart for a total of seven weeks.

== Composition and lyrics ==
The opening track for &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; is &quot;With Bells On&quot;, a &quot;disco-influenced country&quot; interpretation of the Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song of the same name. Visage is featured on the track, and sings about batteries as her only memorable Christmas present. The second track is RuPaul&#x27;s re-imagining of &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; as &quot;RuPaul, the Red-Nosed Drag Queen&quot;. In &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot;, the singer makes a list of requests for various plastic surgery procedures that he would like to receive for the holiday, including cheek implants, chin implants, and a buttock augmentation. He also recorded a cover of &quot;All Alone on Christmas&quot;, calling it his favorite Christmas song; he clarified that he wanted to do a serious interpretation of the track.

RuPaul&#x27;s covers of &quot;I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; and &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot; were noted for their use of camp. He identified &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot; as one of the &quot;serious ones&quot; on the album, and said it was only considered camp due to &quot;the fact that [he was] doing it&quot;. When recording the song, Visage was unfamiliar with its source &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, and sang it according to RuPaul&#x27;s direction. Carol Hall, who had written the song, had described RuPaul&#x27;s cover as her favorite version, and ranked it above Dolly Parton&#x27;s interpretation. The album also includes a cover of &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot;, incorporating elements from funk, and &quot;Christmas Train (Medley)&quot;, serving as a club remix of various Christmas songs. The final track is a remix of the song &quot;Celebrate&quot;; the original version had previously appeared on RuPaul&#x27;s second album &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; (1996).

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; received primarily positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Vibe&quot;&#x27;s Shawnee Smith described the album as a &quot;collection of reinterpretations guaranteed to lift your spirits&quot;, and commended it for its up-tempo instrumentals and ability to reverse &quot;holiday depression&quot;. While highlighting the changes made to the songs&#x27; titles, Ken Veeder of &quot;The Advocate&quot; positively responded to RuPaul&#x27;s interpretations of the Christmas classic in &quot;the gay way&quot;. Veeder pointed to &quot;I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; as his favorite track. &quot;E! News&quot;&#x27; Joal Ryan noted that the album was one of the most boundary-pushing Christmas releases of the year. &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Melinda Newman considered the album a novelty record, praising it as a more humorous example of the genre.

&quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; has also been the subject of praise from several retrospective reviews. During a 2015 interview with the &quot;Gay Times&quot;, RuPaul and Visage stated that &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; had become a &quot;classic Christmas traditional album&quot; alongside releases by American singers Johnny Mathis and Barbra Streisand. In a 2015 article, Idolator&#x27;s Robbie Daw described it as a &quot;yuletide classic&quot;. The same year, Darren Scott of the &quot;Gay Times&quot; praised it as one of his favorite Christmas albums of all time, and a writer from OutTV referred to it as a &quot;collection of cheeky and cheerful tunes&quot;. On the other hand, in a 2017 article, Junkee&#x27;s Bel Ryan felt the album had &quot;for the most part, fallen into the mighty chasm of obscurity&quot;.

In a 2016 retrospective review, Serene Dominic of &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; jokingly included RuPaul as part of its list of artists who should not have released a Christmas album for &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot;. The article was written as a parody of the alt-right and the &quot;War on Christmas&quot;, Dominic joking that the album led to the creation of the bathroom bills.

Some critics have negatively responded to RuPaul&#x27;s use of humor in &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticized RuPaul&#x27;s reliance on camp in the album, writing that it was &quot;tired, predictable, and simply not funny&quot; and that it was a &quot;sad display from an entertainer who used to be hip, clever, and very funny&quot;. Newman questioned the effectiveness of the record&#x27;s overall message, noting that RuPaul&#x27;s message in the liner notes about &quot;creating one&#x27;s own family for the holidays&quot; did not fit with the image of &quot;Ru&#x27;s Christmas panties around his ankles&quot;. While she responded positively to a majority of the songs, Newman viewed &quot;You&#x27;re A Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot; as an unsuccessful cover. In an interview with &quot;Queerty&quot;, American drag queen Hedda Lettuce revealed that RuPaul&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot; was her least favorite Christmas song of all time; Lettuce said that the song &quot;makes [him] want to shove a candy cane in [his] eye&quot;.

<text>Ra’ouf Mus&#x27;ad (sometimes known as Raouf Moussad-Basta) is a playwright, journalist and novelist who was born in Sudan to Coptic parents from Egypt. He moved to Egypt as a teenager and lived in various countries, both in the Middle East and in Europe, during the past 30 years. He has now settled in Amsterdam with his Dutch wife and their children and has taken Dutch nationality.

== Biography ==
He comes from a Coptic Christian background. Although his father&#x27;s family was Coptic, the father was converted to Protestantism and became a Protestant minister. This religious, and more specifically Christian, background is an important part of the struggle with identity and belonging which becomes apparent in much of Mus&#x27;ad’s writing.

He was born in Port Sudan, an Eastern Port on the Red Sea, in 1937 and lived the first years of his life there, before moving with his family to Wad Madani, to the south east of Khartoum on the Blue Nile. From here he was sent to boarding school in Asyut in Middle Egypt, from where he returned to Wad Madani for the summer holidays before his father’s work prompted the family to finally relocate to Luxor-Egypt. He studied journalism at the University of Cairo and graduated in 1960. It was in Cairo in 1954 that he first joined a small underground Marxist organisation initially called ‘The Vanguard of the Workers and Fellaheen’ and then later renamed ‘The Party of the Workers and Fellaheen’.

In Cairo, the family moved around various areas, including al-Fajjala and Deir al-Malaak, in increasing poverty because his father had fallen seriously ill and could no longer work.

In Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, Communist organisations were illegal and political activity was a dangerous pursuit punished with imprisonment. During the Suez Crisis of 1956 Mus&#x27;ad was arrested whilst handing out leaflets urging popular resistance to the foreign occupation of the Suez Canal Zone. He and his comrades were held for one night and then released. In December 1960 he was again arrested at the family flat in Deir al-Malaak after a naïve attempt to escape and disappear. He was held for seven months before being brought before a military court in Alexandria and sentenced for Years imprisonment. He spent another seven or eight months in custody in Alexandria before being moved to the oases prisons where he stayed until the mass releases of 1964. It was in prison that he met and befriended the writers Sonallah Ibrahim and Kamal al-Qalash, with whom he co-authored his first book In 1956.

After his release, in 1964, he started to work as a journalist and began his literary work: plays, stories and reportage. In 1970 he moved to Warsaw, where he studied theatrical production and got married, After he finished his scholarship.

He lived in Poland for five years, during which time he visited many Soviet Bloc countries. This was the start of a long period of self-imposed exile which saw him establish himself in Baghdad (1975) and Beirut (1979) before returning briefly to Egypt in 1982. In Baghdad he worked in the Cinema and Theatre Foundation and met the woman who would become his next wife (after divorcing his Polish wife). In Lebanon he worked as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;as-Safir&quot;, and other magazines &quot;El Louts the magazine of Afro-Asia Union of Writers&quot; and lived in Beirut through the Israeli siege of 1982, where he worked in Beirut El Mesa&#x27;a the magazine of the Communist Workers Organisation which is what eventually forced him to leave Beirut and return to Egypt.

He moved to the Netherlands in 1990, To live with his new family after he met the Dutch lady In Cairo, who became the mother of his children and thy married .He settled in Amsterdam, where he has lived and worked since. He has, in his own words, ‘attained a certain amount of fame’ and has been active in the media, contributing to cultural and political debates, such as the consequences of the war in Iraq and taking part in a televised debate on censorship alongside the celebrated Arab poets Mahmoud Darwish and Adunis.

In 2004 he established in Amsterdam a small publishing house, in collaboration with a number of other Arab writers living outside the Arab world. Named ‘Muhajiroun’, the publisher is intended to print the works of Arab writers free from the difficulties of publishing in the Arab world, which Mus&#x27;ad sees as being beset by problems engendered by ‘the state of decline in the Arab political scene’.
Before that he established a Publishing House in Cairo called &quot;DAR Shouhdi &quot; on the name of a communist leader who was killed in Naser prisons under torture with the help of Shouhdi&#x27;s widow and his daughter hanan.
Now he stopped all other activities but writing.

<text>John James Furlong (25 December 1937 – 27 June 2021) was an Irish businessman and poker player who won the 1999 World Series of Poker main event. 

==Early life==
Furlong was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. He originally became a millionaire from his carpet manufacturing business, Furlong Flooring.

Although christened John James Furlong, he was nicknamed &quot;Noel&quot; because he was born on Christmas Day.

==Poker==
Furlong began playing poker in 1984, and in his first trip to the World Series of Poker in 1989, he placed 6th in the Main Event. That final table was won by Phil Hellmuth, and also included two time world champion, Johnny Chan, and business executive and professional poker player, Lyle Berman.

According to Furlong in 1989, his mentor was Terry Rogers. Furlong stated, &quot;He was my mentor at cards. He got me to take up the game originally.&quot; He added, &quot;I would not have gone to Las Vegas this year to play in the World Poker Championships if not for him. He rang me two days before the event started and said, `I have two firstclass tickets to Vegas.&#x27; He persuaded me to go.&quot;

Ten years later, Furlong&#x27;s biggest win came in the 1999 WSOP main event, in which he won $1 million. He defeated a final table that included professional poker players, Padraig Parkinson, Erik Seidel, Chris Bigler, 1996 WSOP Main Event Champion Huck Seed, and Alan Goehring, whom Furlong defeated in heads-up play to win the title. He was the second-oldest winner of the Main Event at the time of his victory, trailing only Johnny Moss.

Until Andy Black&#x27;s 5th-place finish at the 2005 World Series of Poker main event, he was the top money-winning Irish poker player in the world. He is ranked on the Irish poker tournament money-winning list.

Furlong also won the Irish Poker Open, the longest running tournament in Europe (and now one of the largest), in 1987 and again in 1989. Furlong is one of only five players in Irish Poker Open history to have won the tournament twice.

In his later years, he did not travel much to play poker, preferring to concentrate on his business and other interests while playing occasionally in tournaments in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

As of 2009, Furlong&#x27;s total live tournament winnings exceed $1,100,000. His 3 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,070,785 of those winnings.

==Business and other interests==
Furlong owned a carpet distribution company that does over $100 million worth of business a year. Because of his involvement with the carpet business, he didn&#x27;t play poker frequently, usually only the WSOP and tournaments in Ireland and western Europe. 

Furlong&#x27;s other interests included owning horses and working as a horse trainer. In March 1991 he won £1.5m from bookmakers when his horse Destriero won the Supreme Novices&#x27; Hurdle at Cheltenham.

==Death==
Furlong died on 27 June 2021 from natural causes, aged 83.

<doc id="982134" wikidata="Q2888513" url="?curid=982134" title="Battle of Focchies">
<text>The Battle of Focchies was a significant naval engagement that took place on 12 May 1649, in the harbour of Focchies, Smyrna between a Venetian force of nineteen warships under the command of Giacomo da Riva, and an Ottoman force of eleven warships, ten galleasses, and seventy-two galleys, with the battle resulting in a crushing victory for the Venetian fleet. The battle was an episode in the Cretan War from 1645 to 1669 between the Venetian Republic (along with its allies, the Knights of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Papal States) and the Ottoman Empire over dominance of various territories in the Mediterranean Sea. The war was one in a series of wars between the two warring powers, which contested for control of the Adriatic and Mediterranean trade routes. The primary territory that was contested during the war was Crete, the largest and most profitable of the overseas holdings of the Venetian Republic. The battle came after a squadron of Venetian ships under the command of Giacomo da Riva, a Venetian admiral, came to the rescue of the blockading Venetian force in the Dardanelles Straits, after the blockade had run into unexpected weather conditions and many ships sunk as a result.

Admiral da Riva moved to engage the Ottoman fleet, attempting to prevent them from sailing to Crete and reinforcing the Ottoman forces that were laying siege to the island. To reinforce his fleet before engaging the Ottomans, da Riva hired several English and Dutch armed merchantmen, promising to their captains that he would compensate them for any damages or casualties that they suffered. The Venetian fleet set sail towards the harbour, with the intention to destroy the Ottoman fleet while it was trapped. When the Ottomans saw that the Venetian fleet advancing, ten galleasses were placed in front of the harbour entrance to cover the other ships. The Venetians easily broke through the galleasses, and intense combat began and lasted for four hours, with the Venetian (and hired) warships engaging the Ottoman fleet, easily overwhelming them with superior firepower. The Ottomans put up a spirited defence, but could not stop the Venetians from destroying a significant portion of the fleet. Despite the overwhelming victory, it was not a complete one, and Ottoman naval forces were able to sail to Crete to bring reinforcements, with Crete falling to the Ottomans two decades later.

==Background==

After the loss of Cyprus to the Ottomans in the fourth Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573), the island of Crete (the &quot;Kingdom of Candia&quot;) was the last major overseas possession of the Venetian Republic. Its important strategic position made it an obvious target for future Ottoman expansion, while its size and fertile ground, together with the bad state of its fortresses, made it a more tempting prize than Malta. On the Venetian side, the Serenissima, with its weak military and great dependence on uninterrupted trade, was anxious not to provoke the Ottomans. Hence Venice scrupulously observed the terms of its treaty with the Ottomans, securing over sixty years of peaceful relations. By the early 17th century moreover, Venetian power had declined considerably. Its economy, which had once prospered because of its control over the Eastern spice trade, had suffered as a result of the opening of the new Atlantic trade routes, and from the loss of the important German market because of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1645, the war broke out as Ottoman forces moved to capture Crete from the Venetians.

A Venetian fleet had been ordered to blockade the Dardanelles Straits since April of 1648. On 19 November, most of the fleet withdrew, leaving thirteen warships, under da Riva to maintain the blockade. In Spring 1649, he was joined by Bertucci Civrano with seven more warships, bringing up the total strength of his fleet to nineteen warships, as he had lost a warship to bad weather in the previous months. In early May, the Ottoman fleet appeared from the direction of Istanbul. Only two of Riva&#x27;s ships actually managed to engage them, and in the ensuing chaos, the Ottoman fleet safely made it out of the Strait and headed southwards. Giacomo da Riva, marshaling his fleet, ordered them to follow and successfully trapped the Ottoman fleet at the port of Focchies, on the mainland. Many of the Venetian ships were hired Dutch or English armed merchantmen, and da Riva had to promise to compensate their captains for any damage, due to da Riva realizing that the Dutch or English captains would be unwilling to risk their ships unless they knew that they were going to be adequately compensated for their efforts. On May 12, da Riva ordered his fleet to sail into the harbour and engage the Ottoman ships lying at anchor.

==Battle==

Leading the action from his flagship, the &quot;Rotta Fortuna&quot;, da Riva led his into the harbour. The larger and taller Venetian warships easily smashed aside the galleasses, and the minuscule amount of cannon that a single galleass could carry was no match for the dozens of cannons carried by the Venetian warships. Three galleasses were destroyed, with the rest being damaged and scattered, leaving the path into the harbour clear. The warships, one by one, sailed into the harbour and began engaging the Ottoman warships, aiming to use their overwhelming power to capture the warships and sink the galleys, which carried only a few cannons. The warships moved to engage, as they could withstand the broadside of the Venetian ones in a one-on-one engagement. However, da Riva was short one warship during the engagement, as the captain of the &quot;Esperienza&quot; had refused to sail into the harbour at all, instead keeping out to sea and only rejoining the fleet on the next day. During the action, the Ottoman fleet was slowly overwhelmed and destroyed, as the crews proved no match for Venetian, English and Dutch ones in terms of gunnery skill and seamanship, with many abandoning their ships as they sunk in the harbour.

Once the battle looked to be clearly in the Venetians favour, da Riva ordered men from his ships to set alight and burn the sinking Ottoman ships, as there was still a risk they could be re-floated, and being impossible to be towed out the harbour. In an unusual occurrence during a naval engagement, the galley slaves of one of the Ottoman galleys managed to overwhelm her crew and row towards a Venetian warship, whereupon the liberated slaves promptly surrendered the galley. Two of the smaller warships, the &quot;San Bartolamio&quot;, and the &quot;Francese&quot;, were abandoned by their crew due to damage incurred by Ottoman cannonade. The &quot;San Bartolamio&quot; was able to be successfully regained by the crew of the &quot;Tre Re&quot;, whereas the &quot;Francese&quot; drifted onto the shore and was burnt and destroyed by Ottoman soldiers while beached. When the action was concluding, da Riva surveyed the scene to see a spectacular success- nine warships burnt, three galleasses burnt, two galleys burnt, and one of each type captured. However, at midnight, the wind changed, and the fires set by the Venetians threatened to burn their own warships to the waterline. Upon seeing this, da Riva gave the order to retreat, and the action concluded.

==Aftermath==

In total, the Venetian fleet suffered 105 men killed or wounded, alongside one warship destroyed, burnt by the Ottomans after it drifted onto the shore after being abandoned. The Venetian fleet suffered another loss just ten days later- the &quot;James&quot;, which had captured the galleass during the battle and was dismasted during the fighting- sunk in heavy weather due to damage sustained during the battle. The casualties for the Ottoman fleet was devastating, although not absolute- they still had one warship, seven galleasses, and sixty-nine galleys still intact alongside their crews. The reason for so many ships surviving was due to the wind moving the direction of the flames away from the rest of the Ottoman fleet, and causing the Venetian fleet to withdraw. In the days following the action, da Riva made no attempt to follow up on his victory, but after waiting near Focchies ordered his fleet to weigh anchor and sail towards the Gulf of Smyrna, where he hoped to prevent Christian ships from entering in the service of the Ottoman Navy. Failing to sight any ships, da Riva instead ordered his fleet to sail towards Crete, to link up with Captain General Alvise Mocenigo, who da Riva had written a letter to when he saw the Ottoman fleet leaving the Dardanelles Strait.

On May 23, da Riva, along with his fleet reached Nixa, waiting there for six days until Mocenigo joined forces with him. Mocenigo brought with him four warships, six galleasses and twenty-one galleys from Crete. Mocenigo dissuaded da Riva from launching patrols in the region to search for Ottoman ships, instead holding their position and stopping any significant Ottoman force from reaching Chania. In early June, the Kapudan Pasha left for Rhodes, merging the ships that had not been destroyed into a larger fleet. This fleet was joined by warships and galleys from Egypt and the Barbary States, and reached a size of eighty-three galleys and seventy-four warships, along with countless smaller vessels such as xebecs and gunboats. By late June his fleet arrived at Tine, and from there he sailed towards Milo in preparation for the final journey to Chania. Around the same time, da Riva was stationed at Santorin, but was able to sail to Milo to intercept the Ottoman fleet. However, neither fleet was willing to risk an all-out engagement, and both sides withdrew, the Ottoman fleet allowed to sail unmolested towards Chania. The fleet was able to assist in the ongoing siege, which eventually fell to the Ottomans in 1669, bringing an end to the war in favour of the Ottomans.

<text>John Bull (1562/63 – 12/13 March 1628) was an English composer, organist, virginalist and organ builder. He was a renowned keyboard performer of the virginalist school and most of his compositions were written for this medium.

==Life and career==
Bull&#x27;s place of birth is uncertain. In an article published in 1952, Thurston Dart presumed that Bull&#x27;s family originated in Somerset, where it is possible the composer was born. It was the 17th-century antiquarian Anthony Wood who first proposed that he was related to the Bull family of Peglich, Somerset, but in 1959 Dart wrote that Bull was &quot;probably the son of a London goldsmith…&quot;. Then, in the second edition of his &quot;Calendar of the Life of John Bull&quot;, Dart proposed Hereford as a third possibility. More recent research by Susi Jeans suggests that Bull was born in the Radnorshire parish of Old Radnor within the Diocese of Hereford, although no birth records have yet been discovered. Bull&#x27;s appointment as organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1582 lends credence to this diocese being his place of birth: it was customary at this time for organists to return to their home cathedrals after training in London (cf: Thomas Morley).

In 1573 he joined the choir at Hereford Cathedral, and the next year joined the Children of the Chapel Royal in London, where he studied with John Blitheman and William Hunnis; in addition to singing he learned to play the organ at this time. After being appointed to the Merchant Taylor&#x27;s Company in 1577–78, Bull received his first appointment as organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1582, and then became Master of the Children there.

In 1586 he received his degree from Oxford, and he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal that same year. In 1591, following the death of John Blitheman, he became organist at the Chapel Royal; in 1592 he received his doctorate from Oxford, and in 1596 he became the first professor of music at Gresham College on the recommendation of Queen Elizabeth, who admired him. There is some evidence that she sent Bull on espionage missions: his eighteen-month trip to the continent in 1601–02, ostensibly for health reasons, has never been satisfactorily explained, and his whereabouts there, apart from a visit to Brussels, then in the Spanish Netherlands, remain a mystery. On the death of Elizabeth, he entered into the service of King James, establishing a reputation as a skilled composer, keyboard performer and improviser.

However, in addition to his virtuosity as a keyboard performer and composer, Bull was also skilled at getting into trouble. In 1597 his appointment to Gresham College required him to obey the committee&#x27;s ordinances, lodge at Gresham House, and give an inaugural lecture during the second week of June in the presence of the lord mayor, the aldermen, the Bishop of London and the master and warden of the Mercers Company. Fearful of losing his readership because his assigned rooms were still occupied by Thomas Gresham&#x27;s stepson, William Reade, he forced an entry to the rooms by engaging a mason to help him break down a wall, which led to an action against Bull in Star Chamber. The outcome of this case is not known. Ten years later, he was forced to leave his post at Gresham College on 20 December 1607, after he fathered a child pre-maritally with an Elizabeth Walter, thus losing his best source of income as well as his quarters. Even though he filed a petition for a marriage licence two days after he lost his job, he never returned to the college. He married Elizabeth Walter in 1607, by whom he had a daughter.

Just after publishing seven keyboard pieces in &quot;Parthenia,&quot; Bull left England for good, secretly and with great haste in October 1613.
His salary at the Chapel Royal was paid in lieu to Edmund Hooper. Bull was fleeing the wrath of George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, and King James himself; the charge this time was adultery. William Trumbull, the English envoy in the Low Countries, after first attempting to cover for him – but later fearing for his own position if he continued to do so – wrote to the King in early 1614:

The Archbishop of Canterbury had said of him the previous year: &quot;the man hath more music than honesty and is as famous for marring of virginity as he is for fingering of organs and virginals.&quot; The archbishop described the case to Trumbull; Bull slept in a bed with his wife and two maidservants slept in a truckle bed underneath. One summer morning Bull made one of the maids take his place by his wife, while he slept with the other maid in the truckle bed. Bull had also assaulted a church minister in front of the congregation.

Bull remained in Flanders, where it seems he stayed out of trouble. He was briefly employed at the Brussels court, but was released after Trumbull communicated King James&#x27;s displeasure; he continued to receive money from the court until 1618. In 1615 Antwerp Cathedral appointed him as assistant organist, and as principal organist in 1617. Bull wrote a series of letters while in Flanders, including one to the mayor of Antwerp, claiming that the reason he left England was to escape religious persecution. Although there is no evidence that he was a Catholic, he wrote, somewhat ambiguously

He seems to have been believed, for he was never extradited back to England in spite of Trumbull&#x27;s complaining to the Archduke. While in Antwerp he most probably met Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the most influential keyboard composer of the age.

In the 1620s he continued his career as an organist, organ builder and consultant. He died in Antwerp and was buried on 15 March 1628 in the cemetery next to the cathedral.

==Works==
Bull was one of the most famous composers of keyboard music of the early 17th century, exceeded only by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck in the Netherlands, Girolamo Frescobaldi in Italy, and, some would say, by his countryman and elder, the celebrated William Byrd. He left many compositions for keyboard, some of which were collected in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;.

His first (and only) publication, in 1612 or 1613, was a contribution of seven pieces forming part of a collection of virginal music entitled &quot;Parthenia, or the Maydenhead of the First Musicke That Ever Was Printed for the Virginalls,&quot; dedicated to the 15-year-old Princess Elizabeth, who was his student, on the occasion of her betrothal to Frederick V, Elector Palatine of the Rhine. The other contributors to &quot;Parthenia&quot; were Bull&#x27;s contemporaries William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons, among the most famous composers of the age. Bull also wrote an anthem, &quot;God the father, God the son,&quot; for the wedding in 1613 of the princess and the Elector Palatine.

In addition to his keyboard compositions, he wrote verse anthems, canons and other works.

His 5-part anthem &quot;Almighty God, which by the Leading of a Star&quot;, known colloquially as the &quot;Star Anthem&quot;, was the most popular Jacobean verse anthem, occurring in more contemporary sources than any other.

Much of his music was lost when he fled England; some was destroyed, and some was stolen by other composers, though occasionally such misattributions can be corrected today based on stylistic grounds. One of the most unusual collections of music from the period is his book of 120 canons, an astonishing display of contrapuntal skill worthy of Ockeghem or J.S. Bach. Of the 120 canons, 116 are based on the &quot;Miserere&quot;. Techniques employed to transform the simple theme include diminution, augmentation, retrograde and mixed time signatures. Some of his music in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot; is of a lighter character and uses whimsical titles: &quot;A Battle and No Battle,&quot; &quot;Bonny Peg of Ramsey,&quot; &quot;The King&#x27;s Hunt,&quot; and &quot;Bull&#x27;s Good-Night.&quot;

He is sometimes credited with the composition of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the national and/or royal anthem of a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the Crown Dependencies.

<text>is a Japanese ska punk band from Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka Prefecture.

Debuting in 2001, 175R has released seven singles, seven albums and four DVDs. The band&#x27;s members include Shogo on Vocals, Kazya on guitar, Isakick on bass and Yoshiaki on drums. The band shared their second single with the band Shaka Labbits. The name 175R means &quot;Inago Rider,&quot; which is derived from the &quot;goroawase&quot; of &quot;175&quot; plus &quot;R&quot; for &quot;rider.&quot; &quot;Inago&quot; (蝗) means grasshopper in Japanese, as a reference to the popular &quot;Kamen Rider Series&quot; of tokusatsu television programs. In 2007, the group&#x27;s single &quot;Yume de Aeta Nara...&quot; was featured as the ending theme for the film &quot;Kamen Rider Den-O: I&#x27;m Born!&quot;. 

Another one of their songs, &quot;Melody&quot;, was used featured in a music-related video game for the Nintendo DS called &quot;Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan&quot;. Unlike the other songs included in the game, &quot;Ouendan&quot; made use of an actual (albeit edited) 175R recording, instead of a cover version.

<text>Hueco Tanks is an area of low mountains and historic site in El Paso County, Texas, in the United States. It is located in a high-altitude desert basin between the Franklin Mountains to the west and the Hueco Mountains to the east. &quot;Hueco&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &quot;hollows&quot; and refers to the many water-holding depressions in the boulders and rock faces throughout the region. Due to the unique concentration of historic artifacts, plants and wildlife, the site is under protection of Texas law; it is a crime to remove, alter, or destroy them.

The historic site is located approximately 32 miles (51 km) northeast of central El Paso, Texas, accessible via El Paso&#x27;s Montana Avenue (U.S. Route 62/U.S. Route 180), by turning at RM 2775. The park consists of three syenite (a weak form of granite) mountains; it is in area and is popular for recreation such as birdwatching and bouldering. It is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans. This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, many of which are thousands of years old.

==Designation==
Hueco Tanks State Park &amp; Historic Site was obtained from the county by special deed on June 12, 1969, and by purchase of additional land on August 10, 1970. This site was opened to the public in May 1970. This park is named for the large natural rock basins or &quot;huecos&quot; that have furnished a supply of trapped rainwater to dwellers and travelers in this arid region of west Texas for millennia.

== History ==

The park has gone through considerable changes during private and public ownership. The inscribed names of Texas Rangers and US Cavalrymen, as well as Native American artifacts and paintings, attest to its historic nature.

This site had originally attracted people due to its critical resource needed to survive life in the desert-water. The huge rocks and boulders have cracks and are pocketed with holes-huecos that trap and hold rainwater for months at a time. Passing people found this out and had made it known for future travelers by encrypting the walls with pictures and symbols on the rocks.

===Early inhabitants===
Human habitation of the area dates back 10,000 years with the arrival of the Desert Archaic Culture. These people would have eaten mesquite beans, banana yucca and cactus fruits in Hueco Tanks. The region was inhabited by various peoples, from the Paleo-Indians who used Folsom points to hunt the Megafauna of North America, to the people of the &#x27;Jornada Mogollon&#x27; (pronounced &quot;mo-goi-YONE&quot;). This site was once a Jornada Mogollon village, according to an archaeological dig of the ground between North Mountain and West Mountain. By about 700 years ago, the population of the village could no longer be sustained by the small agricultural area surrounding Hueco Tanks. At this point, a population shift occurred and settlements were formed on the nearby playas to the south, west, and northwest. There, they flourished until about 1450 A.D. when the area suffered from a series of severe droughts. Although it took time, by about 1600 A.D. the region was inhabited by the Apache people, who moved in from Canada (see the Athabascans).

Agriculture was introduced in the area sometime around 1000 A.D. and along with it, the development of the Jornada Mogollon Culture. The Jornada people built a village in the area and grew corn.

Later the area was occupied by Mescalero and Lipan Apaches and Jumano people. Also using the area were Comanche, Kiowa and Tiguas. Spanish and Mexican travelers were rare visitors to the area. The Kiowa called the area the &quot;Tso-doi-gyata-de-dee&quot;, meaning &quot;rock cave where they were surrounded.&quot; In 1837, the Kiowa signed a treaty with the United States, however, shortly after Mexican soldiers forced them into a six-day siege in Hueco Tanks, during which most of them died. The earliest known modern graffiti dates back to the 1840s.

The area was visited by United States Boundary Commissioner, John R. Bartlett, in 1852 who recorded some of the pictographs. Between 1858 and 1859, the Butterfield Overland Mail kept a stagecoach station in the area, but left when a better location was found to the south. An El Paso businessman, Juan Armendariz, purchased much of the Hueco Tanks land to use for ranching in 1895. Silverio Escontrías bought the land from Armendariz in 1898 and the family used it as a ranch and tourist attraction until 1956. The early El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) began to campaign for the land to be turned into a park and in 1935, the National Park Service offered to buy the land from the Escontrías family, but they refused. Fort Bliss leased land from the Escontrías family for training purposes in the 1940s and 50s. The ranch went on the real estate market in 1956 and during this time, members of archaeological and historical societies raised awareness of the area&#x27;s significance. El Paso County took over the land in the mid-1960s.In 1968, it was discussed whether or not the park should be turned over to the Tiguas. In 1969, the El Paso County commissioners decided to deed the park to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. It was made a Texas State Park in 1970. The park&#x27;s information center was made from the old Escontrías ranch house. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Archaeological excavations conducted by George Kegley took place in the area between 1972 and 1973. The park was named the Hueco Tanks State Historic Site in 1998.

== Pictographs ==
The first paintings made at Hueco Tanks were done by members of the Desert Archaic Culture, and depicted abstract designs. These were created between 6000 and 3000 B.C. Between 3000 BC and 450 A.D., pictures of animals and humans were drawn on the rocks.

Most of the pictographs at Hueco Tanks are of Jornada Mogollon origin. The drawings may have been used in praying for rain. The Jornada&#x27;s religion was influenced by Mesoamerican religions. Many of the Hueco Tanks drawings depicted Tlaloc, a rain god and Quetzalcoatl.

Modern graffiti by Anglo people started appearing when someone painted &quot;1849&quot; over some of the original pictographs.

The first scientific overview of the rock paintings at Hueco Tanks happened in the summer of 1939 with Forrest and Lula Kirkland recording the art. Most of the colors used in the paintings came from minerals in the area. The paintings themselves became bound to the rock through the aging process.

In 1972, the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) and the Anthropology Club of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) systematically documented the drawings, their current conditions and sometimes relocated and inspected the rock art. The project discovered 300 previously unrecorded pictographs. The findings of their work was published in &quot;A Rock Art Inventory at Hueco Tanks State Park&quot; (1974). In 1988, park ranger Dave Parker and archeologist Ron Ralph plotted the location of all known pictographs. A digital database of the art and its GPS coordinates was started in 1999 with Robert Mark and Evelyn Billo.

== Geology ==

The syenite pluton was formed 34-38 million years ago, as part of a larger range, the Hueco Mountains, which range in age to over 320 million years ago, when this area was covered by an inland sea. The pluton was eventually exposed through weathering to form the rock formations visible today, which jut from the desert floor. The tanks were once capable of containing a year&#x27;s supply of water. In addition to the tanks, there are several permanent springs and seasonal springs in the area. The area receives less than of rainfall a year.

The syenite rock formation is covered with &#x27;desert patina&#x27; (visible in the image below), the result of thousands of years of weathering of the rock surface by sun, sand, and water; the site is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans, such as the Mescalero Apache, the Kiowa, the Hopi, and the Pueblo people. This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, some of which are thousands of years old. Hueco Tanks contains the single largest concentration of mask paintings by Native Americans in North America, of which hundreds exist at this site.

==Wildlife==
Freshwater shrimp and spadefoot toads survive at the site; for this and other reasons, visitors are cautioned against touching the pools of water at Hueco Tanks to avoid destroying the eggs of these animals. Other amphibians seen in the park include barred tiger salamanders. Around 30 different species of reptiles live in the area. In 2002, 222 different species of bird were documented at the site during the year. Migratory birds such as waterfowl and songbirds pass through during migration seasons. Several birds such as the prairie falcon, burrowing owl, white throated swift, black-chinned hummingbird, ash throated flycatcher, Crissal thrasher, blue grosbeak, Scott&#x27;s oriole and lesser goldfinch all likely breed in the area. The park is home today to mule deer, black bears, bobcats, gray fox, coyotes, badgers, ringtails, skunks, raccoons, mountain lions, black-tailed jackrabbits, desert cottontail, eastern cottontail, six species of bats and twenty species of rodents.

==Plants==
Around the syenite outcrops, the park is surrounded by Chihuahuan Desert scrub with creosote bush as the dominant species. The site contains enough water to support live oaks and junipers, species which survive from the last ice age. Other trees found in the area include netleaf hackberry, Texas mulberry, Mexican buckeye, catclaw acacia, and Arizona white oak. Hueco Tanks has the only population in the United States of the plant &quot;Colubrina stricta&quot;.

== Bouldering ==

Hueco Tanks is widely regarded as one of the best areas in the world for bouldering, that is, rock climbing low enough to attempt without ropes for protection. It is unique for its rock type, the concentration and the quality of the climbing. In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. In February an outdoor bouldering competition known as the Hueco Rock Rodeo is held. The event is a world-class outdoor competition that attracts many professional climbers every year. 

Since the implementation of the Public Use Plan in June 2000, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service&#x27;s inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, more than two-thirds of the park is restricted to tours by volunteer or commercial guides. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time, except on the south side at ground level, which is closed to the public. The park offers camping and showers for $12 per night (as of April 2020), or, as is most popular for climbers, the nearby Hueco Rock Ranch offers camping where climbers can relax and socialize. This is also where commercial guides can be found, and where many volunteer guides stay during the climbing season.

<doc id="982157" wikidata="Q2212160" url="?curid=982157" title="Taxonomy of the Orchidaceae">
<text>The taxonomy of the Orchidaceae ([[orchid family]]) has evolved slowly during the last 250 years, starting with Carl Linnaeus who in 1753 recognized eight genera. De Jussieu recognized the Orchidaceae as a separate family in his Genera Plantarum in 1789. Olof Swartz recognized 25 genera in 1800. Louis Claude Richard provided us in 1817 with the descriptive terminology of the orchids. (See &quot;External links&quot; below). The next step was taken in 1830-1840 by John Lindley, who recognized four subfamilies. He is generally recognized as the father of orchid taxonomy. The next important step was taken by George Bentham with a new classification, recognizing subtribes for the first time. This classification was first presented in a paper that Bentham read to the Royal Society in 1881. Then it was published in 1883 in the final volume of Genera Plantarum. The next great contributors were Pfitzer (1887), Schlechter (1926), Mansfeld (1937), Dressler and Dodson (1960), Garay (1960, 1972), Vermeulen (1966), again Dressler (1981). and Burns-Balogh and Funk (1986). Dressler&#x27;s 1993 book had considerable influence on later work.

&quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot; was published in 6 volumes over 15 years, from 1999 to 2014. It covers all of the known orchids, including a description of each genus. It reflects the considerable progress in orchid taxonomy that had been made since Dressler published his classification in 1993. In the 1990s, orchid taxonomy began to be influenced by molecular phylogenetics based on DNA sequences. The first molecular phylogenetic study to include a substantial sample of orchids was published in 1999. The first classification that was based on cladistic analysis of DNA data was published by Chase et alii in 2003.

An update to that classification was published by Chase et alii in 2015. This classification takes a different approach from &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot;, by consolidating many of the tribes and subtribes, and by recognizing very widely circumscribed genera. As of 2015, Orchidaceae was not yet covered in &quot;The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants&quot;, though most of the vascular plant families had been covered by that time.

The number of genera recognized in the family has varied from one classification to another. In &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot;, many genera were consolidated, reducing their number to 765, smaller than in any previous modern classification. In 2015, Chase et alii merged even more genera, reducing their number to 736.

Useful resources include the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Wikispecies () closely follows this source with modifications as they become accepted. The Plant List also has lists of genera and species, but no other taxonomic information.
== History ==
The following taxonomy follows largely the classification system of Robert Louis Dressler, an orchid specialist and adjunct curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History. This classification, published in 1981 in the book &quot;The Orchids: Natural History and Classification&quot;, was widely accepted by botanists and growers before the publication of &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot;. The initial scheme of 1981 was modified in 1986, twice in 1990, and then again in 1993. This comprehensive classification relies heavily on morphology, especially a few key characters, such as anther configuration and pollinarium structure. Consequently, many of the taxa are not monophyletic.

Cladistic analyses, especially those based on molecular data, provide a firmer basis for classification than intuition, and the certainty (or uncertainty) of conclusions can be quantified by measures of statistical support. While our understanding of orchid phylogeny has greatly improved in recent years, the elucidation of orchid relationships is still ongoing.

When Dressler published his classification in 1993, the relationships of orchids to other monocots was still unknown. Some of the first molecular phylogenetic studies of monocots resolved the Orchidaceae as sister to the astelioid clade of the order Asparagales, but this result never had strong statistical support. It is now known that Orchidaceae is the most basal clade in Asparagales, with the astelioid clade diverging next.

According to cladistic analyses based on morphological character states or on nucleotide sequences, the orchid family is a monophyletic group. The subfamilies recognized by Dressler, however, were not all monophyletic. Dressler&#x27;s delimitation of subfamilies was contradicted by subsequent studies of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear DNA sequences. In 2003, a new phylogenetic classification divided Orchidaceae into five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. These five subfamilies were all strongly supported as monophyletic groups in subsequent studies.

In 2003, the position of Vanilloideae remained equivocal. The subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae clearly formed a monophyletic group and Dressler believed that their closest relative was Vanilloideae. In 2006, a study based on the plastid genes rbcL and atpB found the closest relative of this pair to be Cypripedioideae, rather than Vanilloideae. This result had only weak maximum parsimony jackknife support, but in a phylogenomic study in 2015, it received strong maximum likelihood bootstrap support.

Since 2006, phylogenies of two of the subfamilies, Vanilloideae and Epidendroideae have been published. Phylogenies of several tribes and subtribes have also been published. Compared to previous classifications, more of the tribes and subtribes of Dressler were monophyletic, but not all of them were supported by subsequent studies.

In the classification that was published in 2015, the authors expressed doubt about their division of the tribes Orchideae and Vandeae into subtribes. The placement of the genera &quot;Pachites&quot;, &quot;Holothrix&quot;, and &quot;Hederorkis&quot; is especially problematic. The monophyly of the subtribe Cranichidinae is also in doubt. These authors singled out the tribe Podochileae, as well as the subtribes Oncidiinae, Goodyerinae, and Angraecinae as being in special need of phylogenetic study. The basal epidendroids, especially the tribe Gastrodieae, remain poorly sampled in phylogenetic studies.

== Taxonomy ==
The orchid family (Orchidaceae) is subdivided into five subfamilies, and then into tribes and subtribes. Groups of closely related genera are sometimes referred to informally as alliances. An alliance is a group of taxa, at any taxonomic rank, but usually at the rank of genus or species, that are thought to be closely related. Alliances are designated provisionally and are not recognized in the ICNAFP.

The subtribes are formally divided into genera. Some of the genera are divided into subgenera, and some of the subgenera are divided into sections. All of the genera contain at least one species. A special nomenclature is used to name hybrids between different species.

About 150 species and about a dozen new genera were described each year from 2000 to 2015.

According to Dressler, there are 5 subfamilies, 22 tribes, 70 subtribes, and about 850 genera of orchids. When he published his classification, only about 20,000 species of orchids were known. Several thousand have been described since then.

A distinction between monandrous flowers and others is especially important in the classification of orchids. A monandrous flower is one that has only a single stamen. The flowers are monandrous in the subfamilies Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. Like many others before him, Dressler believed that the monandrous orchids form a monophyletic group. It is now known that monandry arose twice in the orchids, once in Vanilloideae, and again in the common ancestor of Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. The other subfamilies, Apostasioideae and Cypripedioideae, have either three stamens or two stamens and a staminode.

The following subfamilies are recognized:
*Subfamily Apostasioideae: monophyletic - the most basal of the orchids: three fertile anthers, or two fertile anthers and a filamentous staminode.
*Subfamily Cypripedioideae: monophyletic - two fertile diandrous anthers, a shield-shaped staminode and a saccate (= pouch-like) lip.
*Subfamily Orchidoideae: monophyletic - one fertile, monandrous, basitonic anther.
**(Subfamily Spiranthoideae): now accepted as nested within a more broadly defined Orchidoideae as the sub-tribe Spiranthinae of the tribe Cranichideae.
*Subfamily Epidendroideae: monophyletic - includes almost 80% of the orchid species; orchids with an incumbent to suberect (= ascending towards the edges) anther.
**(Subfamily Higher Epidendroideae (formerly Vandoideae): specialised clade within a more broadly defined Epidendroideae
*Subfamily Vanilloideae: monophyletic - an ancient clade now recognized as a distinct subfamily. Their phylogenetic position had long been controversial.

Cladistically, the interrelationships of these subfamilies can be shown in a phylogenetic tree as follows:

==Subfamily Apostasioideae==
The subfamily Apostasioideae belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae).
All well-sampled molecular phylogenetic studies have produced strong bootstrap support for its position as sister to a clade consisting of the other orchid subfamilies. Bootstraping is a method of resampling for quantifying the statistical support for nodes in a phylogenetic tree (= a treelike diagram showing the evolutionary diversification of organisms).

The apostasioid orchids are the most primitive orchids, with only two genera. &quot;Neuwiedia&quot; has three fertile, abaxial (= facing away from the stem) anthers, while &quot;Apostasia&quot; has two fertile abaxial anthers and a filamentous staminode (= a sterile stamen). Plants with mealy or paste-like pollen, which ordinarily are not aggregated into pellets, called pollinia, with two or three fertile long anthers, leaves with sheathing bases, elongated staminode and labellum similar to the petals.

These primitive features make them, according to some authorities, not true orchids but rather ancestors of modern orchids. However, more recent studies indicate that many of their differences with the other orchids were not inherited from a common ancestor with orchids, but arose within the stem group of apostasioid orchids.

==Subfamily Epidendroideae==
This is the largest subfamily, comprising more than 10,000 species in about 90 to 100 genera. Most are tropical epiphytes (usually with pseudobulbs), but some are terrestrials and even a few are myco-heterotrophs. All show a unique development of the single anther: it is incumbent, meaning that it forms a right angle with the column axis or pointed backward in many genera. Most have hard pollinia, i.e. a mass of waxy pollen or of coherent pollen grains; pollinia with caudicle and viscidium or without; stigma entire or 3-lobed; rostellum present; 1-locular ovary; leaves: distichous or spiraling

==Subfamily Higher Epidendroideae==
Formerly called Vandoideae, this is the second largest subfamily with over 300 genera in more than 5,000 species. They are mostly epiphytes, but include some terrestrials and myco-heterotrophs, all occurring in most tropical areas. The main stem grows in a single direction. Many of the species develop pseudobulbs (i.e. a bulge at the base of a stem), that are normally shorter and sturdier than those in the epidendroids. The striking characteristics of the vandoids are a cellular pollinium stalk (= stipe), superposed pollinia and the unique development of the incumbent anther, that bends early in development.

===Tribe Cymbidieae===

===Tribe Orchideae===
This is the largest tribe, containing more than 1,700 species. It has been divided into two subtribes, Orchidinae and Habenariinae. However, the generic boundaries are unclear, and phylogenetic studies show that many genera are paraphyletic or even polyphyletic, so a clear assignment of genera to subtribes is currently not possible.

<doc id="982159" wikidata="Q579719" url="?curid=982159" title="Irrational Exuberance (book)">
<text>Irrational Exuberance is a book by American economist Robert J. Shiller of Yale University, published March 2000. The book examines economic bubbles in the 1990s and early 2000s, and is named after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan&#x27;s famed 1996 comment about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; warning of such a possible bubble.

==Overview==
Published at the height of the dot-com boom, the text put forth several arguments demonstrating how the stock markets were overvalued at the time, and likely to offer poor return on investment based on analysis of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio which Shiller co-developed in the late 1980s. By happenstance, the dot-com bubble peaked the month of the book&#x27;s publication as measured by the Nasdaq stock index, before a gradual collapse by over 80% in the next two years.

The second edition of &quot;Irrational Exuberance&quot; was published in 2005 and was updated to cover the housing bubble. Shiller wrote that the real estate bubble might soon burst, and he supported his claim by showing that median home prices were six to nine times greater than median income in some areas of the country, far above historical long-term averages. He also showed that home prices, when adjusted for inflation, have produced very modest returns of less than 1% per year when measured over long-term periods. Housing prices peaked in 2006 and the housing bubble burst in 2007 and 2008, an event partially responsible for the Worldwide recession of 2008–2009.

The third edition of &quot;Irrational Exuberance&quot; was published in 2015 and included new material on bonds. Shiller warned of significant downside risk to holding long term bonds. Shiller also warned that global house prices were approaching bubble territory and that US Stock prices are high.

==Reactions==
Finance professor Eugene Fama of The University of Chicago has written that Shiller &quot;has been consistently pessimistic about prices,&quot; so given a long enough horizon, Shiller can claim foresight in predicting any crisis. Fama, Shiller and Lars Peter Hansen were co-recipients of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics. Shiller and Fama have had a long-running dispute, with Shiller arguing Fama&#x27;s efficient market hypothesis is seriously flawed.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a retired Wall Street options trader, spoke highly of Shiller&#x27;s book in his own &quot;Fooled By Randomness&quot; (2001). The pair struck up a friendship, and in revised editions of &quot;Randomness&quot; Taleb says he urged Shiller to update &quot;Irrational Exuberance&quot; for what turned out to be the book&#x27;s second edition.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised the third edition of book, saying it was a rarity among economic publications in being loyal to the complexities of the subject while &quot;wholly accessible to general readers.&quot;

==Quotations==
:&quot;[t]he stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average. ... People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes.&quot;

<text>Donna Louise Tartt (born December 23, 1963) is an American novelist and essayist. She wrote the novels &quot;The Secret History&quot; (1992), &quot;The Little Friend&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; (2013), which was adapted into a 2019 film of the same name. She was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2014 &quot;100 Most Influential People&quot; list.

==Early life and education ==
Donna Louise Tartt was born in Greenwood, Mississippi, in the Mississippi Delta, the elder of two daughters. She was raised in the nearby town of Grenada. Her father, Don Tartt, was a rockabilly musician, turned freeway &quot;service station owner-cum-local politician&quot;, while her mother, Taylor, was a secretary. Her parents were avid readers, and her mother would read while driving. As a child, Tartt memorized &quot;really long poems by A. A. Milne&quot;, and described herself as a &quot;horrible repository of doggerel verse.&quot;

Tartt wrote her first poem in 1968, when she was five years old. She was first published at 13, when a sonnet was included in a 1976 edition of the &quot;Mississippi Review&quot;. In high school, she was a freshman cheerleader for the basketball team and worked in the public library. Tartt&#x27;s essays about patriotism and alcoholism won prizes, and she also wrote &quot;short stories about death&quot; during this period.

In 1981, Tartt enrolled in the University of Mississippi, where she pledged for the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and wrote short stories for &quot;The Daily Mississippian&quot;. An editor at the paper gave one of her stories to prominent writer Willie Morris, who found Tartt at the Holiday Inn bar one evening and declared her &quot;a genius.&quot; Following a recommendation from Morris, Barry Hannah, then an Ole Miss writer-in-residence, admitted the 18-year-old Tartt into his graduate course on the short story. Hannah referred to her as &quot;deeply literary&quot; and &quot;a literary star.&quot;

In 1982, following the suggestion of Morris and others, she transferred to Bennington College. At Bennington, Tartt studied classics with Claude Fredericks, and also met Bret Easton Ellis, Jonathan Lethem, and Jill Eisenstadt. Tartt graduated in 1986 with a degree in philosophy.

==Career==
&quot;The Secret History&quot; (1992) was derived from her time at Bennington College. Amanda Urban was her agent and the novel became a critical and financial success. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called Tartt a precocious literary genius, as she was just 29 years old.

Tartt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Little Friend&quot; (2002) was first published in Dutch because her books sold more per capita in the Netherlands than elsewhere.

In 2006, Tartt&#x27;s short story &quot;The Ambush&quot; was included in the Best American Short Stories 2006.

Her 2013 novel &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; divided reviewers as to whether it was a literary novel or not, a controversy possibly based on its best-selling status.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com/2013/10/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted for the movie &quot;The Goldfinch&quot;. Tartt was reportedly paid $3m for the movie rights but parted company with her long-standing agent, Amanda Urban, over the latter&#x27;s failure to secure Tartt a role in the screenplay writing or wider production. The movie was a critical and commercial failure.

Tartt is a convert to Catholicism and contributed an essay, &quot;The spirit and writing in a secular world&quot;, to &quot;The Novel, Spirituality and Modern Culture&quot; (2000). In her essay she wrote that &quot;faith is vital in the process of making my work and in the reasons I am driven to make it.&quot; However, Tartt also warned of the danger of writers who impose their beliefs or convictions on their novels. She wrote that writers should &quot;shy from asserting those convictions directly in their work.&quot;

She has spent about ten years writing each of her novels.

==Personal life ==
In 2002, it was reported that Tartt had lived in Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side, and on a farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. Tartt is tall. She has also stated that she would never get married. 

In 2013, Tartt claimed that she was not a recluse while stressing the freedoms of shutting the door, closing the curtains, and not participating in the life of culture. 

In 2016, Tartt&#x27;s cousin, police officer James Lee Tartt, was killed while on duty.

As of 2016, &quot;Virginia Living&quot; published that Tartt lived with art gallery owner Neal Guma. Both of them studied at Bennington. She and her partner purchased the Charlottesville property back in 1997. Tartt also dedicated her second novel to someone named Neal, although she did not elaborate on his identity.

<doc id="982175" wikidata="Q3977990" url="?curid=982175" title="Supermodel of the World">
<text>Supermodel of the World is the debut studio album by American singer and drag queen RuPaul, released on June 8, 1993, by Tommy Boy Records. It is his second album overall, his first release being a soundtrack album. With the release of the &quot;Supermodel of the World&quot; album, RuPaul obtained higher celebrity status, notably due to the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;. Before the release of this album, he had done some modeling work as a drag queen, hence the album title.

==Background==

African American actress/comedian LaWanda Page (best known as Aunt Esther on the television series &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;) is featured in spoken word clips on several album tracks, though she is heard most notably on the track &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;. That song&#x27;s chorus also features RuPaul repeating the phrase &quot;Sashay! Shantay!&quot; When asked about the meaning of &quot;shantay&quot;, RuPaul replied that the term means &quot;to weave a friend&quot; (from the French &quot;enchanté&quot; which means nice to meet you). The term had previously appeared in the 1990 drag ballroom documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;. It also sounds like the French expression &quot;Sachez chanter!&quot;, at the imperative form, meaning &quot;Know how to sing!&quot;

The album was reissued on Rhino Records.

==Singles==
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;, was a huge club and dance hit that peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and achieved Gold sales status. It also reached number 39 in the UK Singles Chart. The video for the song was put into heavy rotation on MTV; this was a huge surprise to RuPaul and his record label as, at the time, the music being heavily played on MTV was grunge, gangsta rap, and rock. In addition to the success of &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;, &quot;Back to My Roots&quot; charted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Club/Dance Play Songs Chart on July 24, 1993, and number 40 in the UK Singles Chart, where it was backed with &quot;House of Love&quot; as a double A-side. &quot;A Shade Shady (Now Prance)&quot; also charted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Club/Dance Play Songs on October 9, 1993.

==Critical reception==

Robert Christgau wrote in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;I know it wouldn&#x27;t be an authentic disco album without filler, but this self-creation is too blandly male a singer to put over pro forma romance. The exception is &#x27;Supernatural,&#x27; as you&#x27;ll figure out if you match title to persona and consider the possibilities. And when he cops an attitude—on five cuts by my count, culminating in the deep-dish &#x27;A Shade Shady&#x27;—he brings off a time-warped genderfuck all his own.&quot;

Alex Henderson from AllMusic wrote in retrospect: &quot;A colorful transvestite and icon of African-American gay culture whose outrageous sense of humor never seems to let up, RuPaul could arguably be described as &#x27;The Little Richard of &#x27;90s Dance Music.&#x27; But RuPaul isn&#x27;t the novelty act some have dismissed him as being. Boasting a decent vocal range and a strong passion for &#x27;70s disco/soul, RuPaul is a bona fide dance/house music artist whose debut album, Supermodel proved him to be a definite asset to &#x27;90s house and R&amp;B. When he tears into &#x27;Supermodel (You Better Work)&#x27; and other overtly &#x27;70s-influenced dance-floor gems, RuPaul shows himself to be a sweaty, emotional belter who projects a lot more soul and honest emotion than most of the cookie-cutter artists dominating &#x27;90s urban-contemporary radio. Hopefully, those able to look past his wild image will come to realize how good a singer he is.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album peaked at number 109 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="982180" wikidata="Q19090" url="?curid=982180" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">
<text>Robin Hood is a 1973 American animated musical adventure comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. Produced and directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it is based on the English folktale &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. Taking place in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, the story follows the adventures of Robin Hood, Little John, and the inhabitants of Nottingham as they fight against the excessive taxation of Prince John, and Robin Hood wins the hand of Maid Marian. The film features the voices of Brian Bedford, Phil Harris, Peter Ustinov, Pat Buttram, Monica Evans, Terry-Thomas, Roger Miller, and Carole Shelley.

The idea to adapt &quot;Robin Hood&quot; into an animated feature was dated back to Walt Disney&#x27;s interest in the tale of Reynard the Fox following the release of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). The idea was repeatedly shelved for several decades. In 1968, Ken Anderson pitched a film adaptation of Robin Hood, incorporating ideas from Reynard the Fox by using anthropomorphic animals rather than humans. The project was approved, becoming the first completely &quot;post-Walt&quot; animated feature and the first with an entirely non-human cast.

&quot;Robin Hood&quot; was released on November 8, 1973. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was nonetheless a box-office success, grossing $33 million worldwide against a production budget of $5 million. Although some retrospective reviews have criticized the heavy use of animation recycled from previous Disney films, the film&#x27;s reputation has grown positively over time and has since become a cult classic.

== Plot ==

Minstrel Alan-a-Dale narrates the story. While crossing Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood and Little John narrowly escape capture by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his archers. They learn that the arrogant, greedy, and immature Prince John will be traveling through the forest. They rob his caravan, embarrassing the Prince who promises revenge. Robin and Little John distribute the Prince&#x27;s wealth among the starving and overtaxed villagers of Nottingham. Robin also gives a hat and bow to young Skippy Rabbit for the latter&#x27;s birthday. Trying out the bow, Skippy accidentally fires an arrow into the courtyard of Prince John&#x27;s castle. While retrieving it, Skippy and his friends meet Maid Marian and her lady-in-waiting Lady Kluck. Skippy&#x27;s hat reminds Marian of Robin Hood, and she reveals that they were childhood sweethearts. She wonders if Robin still remembers her.

Meanwhile, Robin is thinking of Marian at his and Little John&#x27;s forest hideaway. Local priest Friar Tuck brings news that Prince John will be hosting an archery tournament; the grand prize will be a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin and Little John, disguised as a Devonshire stork and (respectively) the Duke of Chutney, win the competition; however, Prince John sees through Robin&#x27;s disguise and sentences him to death. Marian pleads for Robin&#x27;s life; while they proclaim their love for each other, Little John gets Robin released by threatening Prince John with a dagger in his back. Suddenly the Sheriff of Nottingham intervenes, and Prince John again orders Robin&#x27;s death. The Nottingham villagers fight Prince John&#x27;s soldiers. During the fight, Robin proposes to Marian, which she accepts. Robin, Marian, Lady Kluck, and Little John escape.

Robin and Marian share a romantic evening, which is disrupted by the partying of the Nottingham villagers. They sing “The Phony King of England”, about Prince John&#x27;s fraud and incompetence; the song becomes popular even among Prince John&#x27;s own advisors. The Prince angrily triples the taxes on the villagers, all of whom are soon jailed when their money runs out. Visiting Friar Tuck&#x27;s now-empty church, the Sheriff takes a gold coin from the poor box. When Friar Tuck attempts to get the coin back, he is arrested for high treason. Prince John orders his execution as bait to trap Robin Hood.

The night before the execution, Robin and Little John break into the jail. They free the villagers, who make off with Prince John&#x27;s wealth. Sir Hiss, ostensibly the Prince&#x27;s aide-de-camp but in fact his whipping boy, tries to stop the breakout by rousing the castle. The villagers escape, but Robin is trapped while rescuing Skippy&#x27;s younger sister Tagalong. The Sheriff chases Robin with a lit torch, setting the castle on fire. Cornered, Robin evades Prince John&#x27;s archers by diving from a turret into the moat. Sir Hiss criticizes Prince John for the plot, which resulted in his mother&#x27;s castle being destroyed. Infuriated, the Prince chases Hiss through the flames.

Later on, King Richard returns from the Crusades. He puts Prince John, Sir Hiss, and the Sheriff of Nottingham in prison. Richard also pardons Robin Hood and forgives the villagers&#x27; taxes. Robin and Marian are married and ride off together.

== Production ==
During production on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1937, Walt Disney became interested in adapting the twelfth-century legend of Reynard the Fox. However, the project languished due to Disney&#x27;s concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero. In a meeting held on February 12, 1938, Disney commented: I see swell possibilities in &#x27;Reynard&#x27;, but is it smart to make it? We have such a terrific kid audience ... parents and kids together. That&#x27;s the trouble – too sophisticated. We&#x27;ll take a nosedive doing it with animals.For &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), Disney seriously considered three animated sections, each one of the Reynard tales, to be told by Long John Silver to Jim Hawkins as moral fables. Ultimately, the idea was nixed as &quot;Treasure Island&quot; became the studio&#x27;s first fully live-action film. In the next decade, the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film based on Edmond Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Chanticleer&quot;, but the production was scrapped in favor of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963).

In October 1968, Ken Anderson went on a fishing trip with Disney Studios president Card Walker. There, Walker suggested that a classic tale should be the subject for the next animated film after &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970). Anderson proposed the tale of Robin Hood, to which Walker responded enthusiastically. Back at the studio, Anderson relayed the idea during a story meeting on &quot;The Aristocats&quot; which was met with approval. In a follow-up meeting, with Wolfgang Reitherman, Bill Anderson (no relation), and Larry Clemmons, Ken Anderson was assigned the job to begin &quot;exploratory animal character drawings&quot;. On his own, Anderson blended his ideas for the character Robin Hood by conceptualizing him as a slick fox that still used his skills to protect the community.

Additionally, Anderson wanted to set the film in the Deep South desiring to recapture the spirit of &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). Anderson explained, &quot;Basically I had a wonderful time on &quot;Song of the South&quot;, and I know that all of my friends in animation did. They loved the part I played and I loved the part they played ... And so it was an attempt on my part to get the best of that sort of thing and get it going on again, bring it up-to-date.&quot; However, the Disney Studios executives had precautions because of the racial controversy surrounding &quot;Song of the South&quot;. Reitherman further overruled Anderson&#x27;s creative suggestion by setting the film in its traditional English location as inspired by &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952). Clemmons came on board the project to write a story outline with dialogue that was later storyboarded by other artists.

As production went further along, Robin Allan stated in his book &quot;Walt Disney and Europe&quot; that &quot;Ken Anderson wept when he saw how his character concepts had been processed into stereotypes for the animation on &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.&quot; According to Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, one such casualty was the concept of making the Sheriff of Nottingham a goat as an artistic experiment to try different animals for a villain, only to be overruled by Reitherman who wanted to keep to the villainous stereotype of a wolf instead. Additionally, Anderson wanted to include the Merry Men into the film, which was again overridden by Reitherman because he wanted a &quot;buddy picture&quot; reminiscent of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969). Little John was the only Merry Man retained in the film, while Friar Tuck was put as a friend of Robin&#x27;s who lived in Nottingham, and Alan-a-Dale was turned into the narrator.

Because of the time spent on developing several settings, and auditioning actors to voice the title character, production fell behind schedule. In order to meet its deadline, the animators had no other choice but to recycle several dance sequences from previous Disney animated films, including &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970) that are used in the &quot;Phony King of England&quot; scene.

=== Casting ===
By October 1970, most of the voice actors were confirmed, with the exception of Tommy Steele cast in the title role. Steele himself was chosen because of his performance in &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (1967) while Peter Ustinov was cast because Walt Disney had enjoyed his presence on the set of &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968). However, Steele was unable to make his character sound more heroic, and his replacement came down to final two candidates which were Bernard Fox and Brian Bedford. Disney executives had first seen Bedford performing onstage in Los Angeles, in which they brought him in to test for the role in May 1971 and ultimately cast him. Meanwhile, Louis Prima was so angered at not being considered for a role that he personally paid the recording expenses for the subsequent album, &quot;Let&#x27;s &quot;Hear&quot; it For Robin Hood&quot;, which he sold to Disneyland Records.

== Release ==
The film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on November 8, 1973. The film was re-released on March 26, 1982.

=== Home media ===
The film was first released on VHS, CED, Betamax, and Laserdisc on December 3, 1984, becoming the debut installment of the Walt Disney Classics home video line. Disney had thought the idea of releasing any of its animated classics (known as the &quot;untouchables&quot;) might threaten future theatrical reissue revenue. However, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was viewed as the first choice since it was not held in such high esteem as some of the other titles. The VHS counterpart was re-released several times. The release went into moratorium in April 1987. 4 years after the moratorium, it was re-issued as a permanent availability title on July 12, 1991. The film was re-released on VHS six more times; on October 28, 1994, March 3, 1995, February 28, 1996, July 15, 1997, March 31, 1998, and July 13, 1999, in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line.

In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection. Six months later, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was re-released on VHS and DVD in the line on July 4, 2000, and remained in stock until the spring of 2006. The DVD contained the film in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and was accompanied with special features including a trivia game and the cartoon short &quot;Ye Olden Days&quot;. The remastered &quot;Most Wanted Edition&quot; DVD (&quot;Special Edition&quot; in the UK) was released on November 28, 2006, in a 16:9 matted transfer to represent its original theatrical screen ratio. It also featured a deleted scene/alternate ending of Prince John attempting to kill a wounded Robin Hood. On August 6, 2013, the film was released as the 40th Anniversary Edition on a Blu-ray combo pack.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reaction ===
Judith Crist, reviewing the film in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, said it was &quot;nicely tongue-in-cheek without insult to the intelligence of either child or adult.&quot; She also stated that it &quot;has class – in the fine cast that gives both voice and personality to the characters, in the bright and brisk dialogue, in its overall concept.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;should ... be a good deal of fun for toddlers whose minds have not yet shriveled into orthodoxy&quot; and he called the visual style &quot;charmingly conventional&quot;. Dave Billington of &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; wrote &quot;As a film, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; marks a come-back of sorts for the Disney people. Ever since the old maestro died, the cartoon features have shown distressing signs of a drop in quality, both in art work and in voice characterization. But the blending of appealing cartoon animals with perfect voices for the part makes &quot;Robin Hood&quot; an excellent evening out for the whole family.&quot; Also writing in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Ruth Gilbert called it &quot;a sweet, funny, slam-bang, good-hearted Walt Disney feature cartoon with a fine cast&quot; and wrote it was &quot;a feast for the eyes for kiddies and Disney nostalgics.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the Disney &quot;hallmarks are there as they ever were: the incomparably rich, full animation, the humanized animal characters perky, individual and enchanting, and the wild, inventive slapstick action.&quot; Awarding the film four stars out of five, Ian Nathan, in a retrospective review for &quot;Empire&quot;, praised the vocal performances of Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas acknowledging &quot;while this is hardly the most dazzling of animated features, it has that cut-corner feel that seem to hold sway in the &#x27;70s (mainly because Disney were cutting corners), the characters spark to life, and the story remains as rock steady as ever.&quot;

Among less favorable reviews, Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a mixed verdict writing, &quot;Even at its best, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is only mildly diverting. There is not a single moment of the hilarity or deep, eerie fear that the Disney people used to be able to conjure up, or of the sort of visual invention that made the early features so memorable. &quot;Robin Hood&quot;″s basic problem is that it is rather too pretty and good natured.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, describing the film as &quot;80 minutes of pratfalls and nincompoop dialog,&quot; and criticizing the animation quality as &quot;Saturday morning TV cartoon stuff.&quot; John Baxter of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;for the most part the film is as bland and one-dimensional as the product of less sophisticated studios; and except for Peter Ustinov&#x27;s plummy Prince John, the voice characterisations are as insipid as the animation is unoriginal.&quot;

Decades since the film&#x27;s release, the film has been noted for the recycled scenes of animation. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus states that &quot;One of the weaker Disney adaptations, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is cute and colorful but lacks the majesty and excitement of the studio&#x27;s earlier efforts.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 57 based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

=== Box office ===
During its initial release, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; earned $9.6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada. It also grossed $18 million in foreign territories, which was at the time a Disney record, for a worldwide rental of $27.5 million.

The film has earned a lifetime gross in the United States and Canada between $32–35 million across its two releases.

=== Accolades ===
== Music ==

In 1969, Roger Miller began composing the songs for the film. A record of the film was made at the time of its release in 1973, which included its songs, score, narration, and dialogue. Both &quot;Oo-De-Lally&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; appear on the CD collection, &quot;Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic&quot;. &quot;Love&quot; is featured in the soundtrack for the 2009 film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;, directed by Wes Anderson. The full soundtrack of the film was released on August 4, 2017, as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection&quot; series on compact disc and digital.

The song &quot;The Phony King of England&quot; bears a strong resemblance to a much older, bawdy English folk song, &quot;The Bastard King of England&quot;.

=== Songs ===
Original songs performed in the film include:

== Legacy ==
The film has since become a fan favorite. Disney animator and director Byron Howard admitted that &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was his favorite film while growing up and cited it as a major influence on &quot;Zootopia&quot;. It was also one of the many inspirations for the then-emerging furry fandom. Some of the characters from the film also cameoed in the 1983 Oscar-nominated featurette short &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. The film was nominated for a spot on AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 by American Film Institute in 2008 for the Animated Film list.

The song &quot;Love&quot; was featured in the 2009 feature film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;. as well as on the 2023 Amazon.com Super Bowl ad &quot;Saving Sawyer&quot;. The song &quot;Whistle-Stop&quot; was sped up and used in the Hampster Dance, one of the earliest internet memes, and later used at normal speed in the Super Bowl XLVIII commercial for T-Mobile. The song &quot;Oo De Lally&quot; is featured in a 2015 commercial for Android which shows animals of different species playing together.

Robin Hood, Little John, Maid Marian, Prince John and Sir Hiss appear as playable characters in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, along with attractions based on Sherwood Forest and Nottingham. In the game, the characters are involved in new storylines that serve as a continuation of the events of the film.

=== CGI remake ===
In April 2020, it was reported that Disney was developing a live-action/CG hybrid remake of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; featuring the same kind of anthropomorphic characters as in the 1973 film, with Kari Granlund writing, Carlos Lopez Estrada directing (after previously directing the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;), and Justin Springer producing. The remake was set to be released exclusively on Disney+.

<text>Adam of Ebrach (late 11th century – 23 November 1167) was a Cistercian monk and the first abbot of Ebrach Abbey in the area of Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany, and later the founding abbot of Langheim Abbey.

==Biography==
Adam, originating from Cologne, is first recorded when entering the Cistercian monastery of Morimond Abbey in Burgundy. He is probably the monk Adam, who belonged to a group led by Abbot Arnold the German, who left Morimond Monastery in 1124 to found a new monastery in the Holy Land. After Abbot Arnold&#x27;s death on January 3, 1126 Bernhard of Clairvaux wrote to Adam asking him to return to Morimond. The confidence with which Bernard assumed that the rest of the monks would follow Adam points to Adam&#x27;s gift of leadership.

In 1127, he led twelve monks to Franconia to settle the monastery of Ebrach, newly founded by local Frankish nobles Berno and Richwin von Eberau. Berno was an important retainer of the Würzburg prince-bishop Embricho. The first church was dedicated in 1134 by Bishop Emicho.

Adam seems to have led the monastery with great success, so that six daughter monasteries were founded with his influence, in Franconia, Styria and Lower Bavaria:in 1129 in Rein, the oldest Cistercian monastery in the world that still exists today, in 1132 in Heilsbronn and in Langheim, in 1145 at Nepomuk, in 1146 the monastery of Aldersbach near Passau and in 1156 the monastery of Bildhausen near Münnerstadt in Bavaria. As abbot, he made yearly visits to the monasteries founded from Ebrach. He would also travel to the order&#x27;s annual General Chapter at Cîteaux.

Three brothers from the city of Bamberg made a gift of the estate of Langheim to Otto I, bishop of Bamberg, who in 1132 offered it to Adam on condition that it should be used for the establishment of a new monastery of the order. The first stone was laid on 1 August 1132. The abbey, like Ebrach, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and Saint Nicholas. The first abbot was Adam, who succeeded in gaining the support not only of the bishops of Bamberg but of the local nobility. 

Adam was a close friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, and maintained contact with Hildegard of Bingen and theologian Gerhoh von Reichersberg, provost of Reichersberg Abbey. He also had a major role in the mobilisation for the Second Crusade. He was well received at the court of Conrad III, whose wife, Gertrude of Sulzbach, and their young son, Friedrich von Rothenburg, were buried at Ebrach Abbey. Adam was also held in esteem by the pope and by Emperor Frederick I. The latter added him to his first delegation to Pope Eugenius III, referring to him as &quot;the man of my trust, in ecclesiastic and worldly things&quot;. However, when Barbarossa later backed the Antipope Victor IV, he lost Adam&#x27;s support.

Adam&#x27;s remains rest in the mausoleum of the abbey church in Ebrach.

<text>Tyrolean Airways, legally &quot;Tyrolean Airways Tiroler Luftfahrt GmbH&quot;, was an Austrian regional airline based in Innsbruck with its hub at Vienna International Airport and its homebase at Innsbruck Airport. It was owned by the Lufthansa Group and was an affiliate of the Star Alliance together with its parent Austrian Airlines.

Tyrolean operated regional flights under the &quot;Austrian Arrows&quot; brand on behalf of Austrian Airlines from 2003 until July 2012, when nearly all employees and the fleet of Austrian Airlines was transferred to it following a labour dispute. Following a new labour agreement, Tyrolean was merged into Austrian Airlines and dissolved as a company on 31 March 2015.

==History==
===Early years===
The airline was established in 1958 as Aircraft Innsbruck by Gernot Langes-Swarovski and Christian Schwemberger-Swarovski. It adopted the title Tyrolean Airways when scheduled services began on 1 April 1980.

Tyrolean Airways was the only airline to operate Dash 7 airplanes into the steeply inclined mountain airport at Courchevel in France.

===Development as part of Austrian Airlines===
The airline was acquired by Austrian Airlines in March 1998 after the original majority owner, Mr Gernot Langes-Swarovski, made the company available for purchase. In 2003, as part of an effort by its parent company to consolidate its brand, the fleet was rebranded as &quot;Austrian Arrows&quot; with livery changed to match that of the Austrian Airlines Group. Airline operations, however, were still managed independently by Tyrolean from its Innsbruck base.

As of 1 July 2012, all Austrian Airlines Group flights were carried out by Tyrolean Airways. In a consolidated effort to save Austrian Airlines from bankruptcy, the Austrian Airlines CEO at the time, Jaan Albrecht merged the entire fleet and staff of the Austrian Airlines Group, approximately 460 pilots and 1,500 cabin crew, into Tyrolean. All Austrian Airlines Group flights — except for a single Boeing 777-200ER (OE-LPB) due to international traffic laws — were operated by Tyrolean, but maintained their Austrian flight numbers.

In October 2014, it was reported that Tyrolean&#x27;s flight operations and staff were to be re-integrated into Austrian Airlines, as a new labour agreement had been signed. On 31 March 2015 all flight operations, crew members and aircraft were reintegrated into Austrian Airlines. Tyrolean Airways was dissolved having served as a vehicle to return Austrian Airlines to operation.

<text>Peter Pan is a 1953 American animated adventure fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1904 play &quot;Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, the film was directed by Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, and Wilfred Jackson. Featuring the voices of Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont, Hans Conried, Bill Thompson, Heather Angel, Paul Collins, Tommy Luske, Candy Candido, Tom Conway, Roland Dupreee and Don Barclay, the film&#x27;s plot follows Wendy Darling and her two brothers, who meet the never-growing-up Peter Pan and travel with him to the island of Never Land to stay young, where they also have to face Peter&#x27;s archenemy, Captain Hook.

In 1935, Walt Disney began considering plans to adapt Barrie&#x27;s play into an animated feature. He purchased the film rights from Paramount Pictures in 1938, and began preliminary development in the next year. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Disney shelved the project when his studio was contracted by the United States government to produce training and war propaganda films. The project sat idle in development for the rest of the decade until it experienced a turnaround in 1949. To assist the animators, live-action reference footage was shot with actors on soundstages. It also marked the last Disney film in which all nine members of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men worked together as directing animators.

&quot;Peter Pan&quot; was released on February 5, 1953, becoming the final Disney animated feature released through RKO before Disney founded his own distribution company. The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, Upon its release, the film earned positive reviews from film critics and was a box office success. Its representation of the Native Americans received retrospective criticism.

A sequel, titled &quot;Return to Never Land&quot;, was released in 2002, and a series of direct-to-DVD prequels focusing on Tinker Bell began in 2008. A live-action adaptation of the film was released on Disney+ in 2023.

==Plot==

In Edwardian London 1904, George and Mary Darling&#x27;s preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of their boys, John and Michael, who are acting out a Peter Pan story told them by their elder sister Wendy. An irritated George demands that Wendy drop the stories and move out of the nursery, since &quot;sooner or later, people have to grow up&quot;. Later that night, Peter himself arrives in the nursery to find his lost shadow. He persuades Wendy to come to Never Land, where she will never have to grow up, and she and the boys fly there with the begrudging help of the pixie Tinker Bell.

A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, led by Captain Hook and his first mate, Mr. Smee. Hook wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his hand, but fears the crocodile which consumed the hand, knowing it is eager to eat the rest of him. When Pan and the Darlings arrive, Hook shoots at them with a cannon, and Peter sends the Darlings off to safety while he baits the pirates. Tinker Bell, who is jealous of Pan&#x27;s attention to Wendy, convinces the Lost Boys that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy. Tinker Bell&#x27;s treachery is soon found out, and Peter banishes her. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island&#x27;s Natives; however, the Natives capture the group, believing them to be responsible for taking the chief&#x27;s daughter, Tiger Lily.

Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids, who flee in terror when Hook arrives on the scene. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to force her to disclose the location of Peter&#x27;s hideout. Peter frees Tiger Lily and returns her to the Chief, and the tribe honors Peter. Meanwhile, Hook takes advantage of Tinker Bell&#x27;s jealousy of Wendy, tricking the fairy into revealing Peter&#x27;s secret hideout instead.

Wendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return to London. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to join them and be adopted by the Darlings. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter does not want to grow up and refuses. The pirates lie in wait, and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit the lair, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. Hook attempts to persuade the Lost Boys and the Darlings to join the crew or walk the plank. Tinker Bell learns of the plot, just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes.

Peter rescues Tinker Bell from the rubble, and together they rescue Wendy, confronting the pirates and releasing the children. Peter engages Hook in combat as the children fight off the crew, and defeats him. Hook falls into the sea and swims away, pursued by the crocodile. Peter commandeers the deserted ship and, assisted by Tinker Bell&#x27;s pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard.

George and Mary Darling return home and find Wendy sleeping at the nursery&#x27;s open window. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, who has softened his position about Wendy staying in the nursery, recognizes the ship from his own childhood, hinting that he himself went to Neverland when he was a boy.

==Production==
===Early development===

Walt Disney was familiar with J. M. Barrie&#x27;s play &quot;Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; since childhood, having seen a touring production starring Maude Adams at the Cater Opera House in Marceline, Missouri, in 1913. In 1935, he first expressed interest in adapting the play as his second animated feature film after &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which was still in production at the time. During his acquisition spree in Europe in April 1938, Roy O. Disney went to London to acquire the rights from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, but Paramount Pictures had already secured the live-action screen rights. The hospital unsuccessfully offered to have Disney and Paramount make an agreement; however, by October of that year, Walt had purchased the animation rights from Paramount and commissioned Dorothy Ann Blank to develop the story. In January 1939, Disney signed a £5,000 contract with the hospital, and by May of that year, as the story work was in the preliminary stages, he had several animators in mind for some of the charactersBill Tytla was considered for the pirates, Norman Ferguson for Nana, and Fred Moore for Tinker Bell.

During this time, many possible interpretations of the story were explored. In the earliest treatment, written by Blank on April 14, 1939, the film would start by telling Peter Pan&#x27;s backstory, which was based on Barrie&#x27;s 1906 book &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;. However, during a story meeting the following month, Disney decided that they &quot;ought to get right into the story itself, where Peter Pan comes to the house to get his shadow. That&#x27;s where the story picks up. How Peter came to be is really another story.&quot; Disney also explored the idea of opening the film in Never Land with Peter coming to Wendy&#x27;s house to kidnap her as a mother for the Lost Boys. Eventually, it was decided that the kidnapping plot was too dark, and Disney went back to Barrie&#x27;s original play, in which Peter comes to get his shadow back and Wendy herself is eager to see Never Land.

By early 1940, David Hall, who had also worked on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, created first exploratory storyboards and concept art for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Later that year, Disney personally attempted to contact Maude Adams, who by then had retired from acting and was teaching drama at Stephens College. Disney notified her of his plans for an animated feature, and requested for her to view an early reel of the film that the studio had produced for her approval. He further affirmed that his studio would send the necessary screening equipment to Columbia College for the presentation and that it could be open to any Stephens College student or faculty member interested in attending. Adams, however, rejected Disney&#x27;s proposal. In a 1941 studio memo to Kay Kamen, he wrote: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t even give me the courtesy of looking at our reel. Her reasons were to the effect that &#x27;Peter whom she created was to her real life and blood, while another&#x27;s creation of this character would only be a ghost to her&#x27;. It seems pretty silly and from my point of view, I would say that Miss Adams is simply living in the past.&quot;

===Production delays===
By 1941, the basic story structure of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was completed, but later that year, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States military took control of Walt Disney Productions. It commissioned the studio to produce training and war propaganda films, thus pre-production work on &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, as well as on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), was suspended. However, the Bank of America allowed for production on &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, along with &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1949), to continue during World War II. After the war had ended, pre-production of the film resumed with Jack Kinney as director. At the time, Kinney had considered leaving Walt Disney Productions for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, but wartime restrictions prevented it. Since he did not want Kinney to get out of his contract, Disney appointed Kinney to direct &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

Impatient with the delays, Disney asked Kinney to work on sequences consecutively rather than finishing the entire script before it was storyboarded, so that a scene would be approved at a morning story meeting and then immediately put into development. Six months later, during a storyboard meeting, Kinney presented a two-and-a-half-hour presentation, during which Disney sat silently and then stated, &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve been thinking about &quot;Cinderella&quot;.&quot;

===Return to actual production===
By 1947, Walt Disney Productions&#x27; financial health started to improve again. Around this time, Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies, but emphasized to his financial backers that slashing production would be suicidal to the studio. In order to restore the studio to profitability, Disney expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. By then, three animated projects—&quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;—were in development. Disney had felt the characters in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; were too cold, but because &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950) contained similar elements when compared to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), he decided to greenlight &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In May 1949, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;Peter Pan&quot; had been placed back into production.

The scene in the nursery went through many alterations. In one version, it is Mrs. Darling who finds Peter Pan&#x27;s shadow and shows it to Mr. Darling, as in the original play. In another version of the film, Nana goes to Never Land with Pan and the Darling children, the story being told through her eyes. In another interpretation of the story, John Darling is left behind for being too serious, practical and boring, but story artist Ralph Wright convinced Disney to have John go with the others to Never Land. This adaptation also included Wendy bringing her Peter Pan picture book and Peter and the children eating an &quot;imaginary dinner&quot;. At one point, a party in Peter&#x27;s hideout was conceived at which Tinker Bell becomes humiliated and, in her rage, tells Captain Hook the location of Peter Pan&#x27;s hideout of her own free will. However, Disney felt that this story was contrary to Tinker Bell&#x27;s character; instead, he had Captain Hook kidnapping Tinker Bell and persuading her to tell him. In Barrie&#x27;s play, Captain Hook puts poison in Peter&#x27;s dose of medicine and Tinker Bell saves Peter by drinking the poison herself, only to be revived by the applause of the theater audience. After much debate, Disney discarded this story development, fearing it would be difficult to achieve in a film.

In earlier scripts, there were more scenes involving the pirates and mermaids that were similar to those with the dwarfs in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Ultimately, these scenes were cut for pacing reasons. The film concept was also a bit darker at one point than that of the finished product; for example, there were scenes involving Captain Hook being eaten by the crocodile like in the original play, the Darling family mourning over their lost children and Pan and the children discovering the pirates&#x27; treasure loaded with booby traps.

===Casting===

Walt Disney originally wanted to cast Mary Martin as Peter Pan, but Roy Disney disagreed, finding Martin&#x27;s voice &quot;too heavy, matured and sophisticated&quot;. Jean Arthur also approached Walt Disney to consider her for the role. Bobby Driscoll, who was Disney&#x27;s first contract child actor and had previously starred in such films as &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; (1948), and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), was ultimately cast. This was the first time that a male actor was cast as Peter Pan, breaking a tradition of women portraying him in both films and stage productions. Driscoll also provided some of the live-action reference for the character. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was Driscoll&#x27;s last Disney film, as his contract with the studio was abruptly terminated shortly after its release.

For the role of Wendy, Disney wanted a &quot;gentle and gracefully feminine&quot; voice, which he found in Kathryn Beaumont, who had previously voiced the title character in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951) and had just finished working on the film. Disney initially offered the role of Captain Hook to Cary Grant, which the latter was &quot;intrigued with&quot;, but eventually Hans Conried was cast as both Hook and, in keeping the tradition of the stage play, George Darling.

===Animation===
====Live-action reference====
As with previous Disney animated features since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), a live-action version with the actors performing to a prerecorded dialogue track was filmed to serve as an aid to animators. Margaret Kerry received a call to audition to serve as the live-action reference for Tinker Bell. For the live-action reference, Kerry said she had to hold out her arms and pretend to fly for all the scenes requiring it. Additionally, Kerry served as reference for one of the mermaids, along with Connie Hilton and June Foray.

At the same time, the studio was looking for an actor to portray Peter Pan, to which Kerry suggested her dancing teacher Roland Dupree. He was interviewed and eventually won the role, providing visual reference for the flying and action sequences. Bobby Driscoll also served as the live-action reference model for Peter Pan, although he was mainly used for the close-up scenes. Kathryn Beaumont, who was the voice of Wendy, performed the live-action reference footage for the character.

Hans Conried completed the voice work over the course of a few days, but served as the live-action reference for two and a half years.

====Character animation====
Milt Kahl wanted to animate Captain Hook but was instead assigned to animate Peter Pan and the Darling children; he claimed he was &quot;outmaneuvered&quot;. During production, while animating Peter Pan, Kahl claimed that the hardest thing to animate was a character floating in mid-air. While observing the animation of Peter Pan, Disney complained that the animators had let too many of Bobby Driscoll&#x27;s facial features find their way into the character design, telling Kahl that &quot;[t]hey are too masculine, too old. There is something wrong there.&quot; Kahl replied, &quot;You want to know what&#x27;s wrong!?... What&#x27;s wrong is that they don&#x27;t have any talent in the place.&quot;

The job of animating Captain Hook was assigned to Frank Thomas, who faced conflicting visions of the character. Story artist Ed Penner viewed Hook as &quot;a very foppish, not strong, dandy-type, who loved all the finery. Kind of a con man. [Co-director Gerry] Geronimi saw him as an Ernest Torrence: a mean, heavy sort of character who used his hook menacingly.&quot; When Disney saw Thomas&#x27; first test scenes, he said, &quot;Well, that last scene has something I like I think you&#x27;re beginning to get him. I think we better wait and let Frank go on a little further.&quot; Because Thomas could not animate every scene of Hook, certain sequences were given to Wolfgang Reitherman, such as Hook trying to escape the crocodile at Skull Rock.

Ollie Johnston animated Mr. Smee. To best capture his comedic yet fear-ridden, sycophantic personality, Johnston used a variation of the Dwarf design from &quot;Snow White&quot;, and had Mr. Smee blink repeatedly. Johnston&#x27;s former mentor, Fred Moore, worked in his unit as a character animator for Smee&#x27;s minor scenes. Moore also animated the mermaids and the Lost Boys. The film would be Moore&#x27;s final work as he died in a traffic accident on November 22, 1952.

==Music==
Frank Churchill wrote several songs for the film during the early 1940s, and Charles Walcott wrote additional songs in 1941. When work on &quot;Peter Pan&quot; resumed in 1944, Eliot Daniel composed songs for the film. However, this version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was shelved so the studio could complete &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In April 1950, it was reported that Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain were composing songs for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. 
The incidental music score for the movie is composed by Oliver Wallace.

===Songs===
The melody for &quot;The Second Star to the Right&quot; was originally written for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as part of a song to be entitled &quot;Beyond the Laughing Sky&quot;. Some Disneyland-issued compilations give the title as &quot;Second Star to the Right&quot; (no &quot;The&quot;); see, for example, &quot;50 Happy Years of Disney Favorites&quot; (Disneyland Records, STER-3513, Side II). &quot;What Made the Red Man Red?&quot; became controversial because of its stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans. &quot;Never Smile at a Crocodile&quot; was cut from the movie soundtrack, but was included for the 1997 Walt Disney Records CD release. The song, with lyrics, also appears in the &quot;Sing-Along Songs&quot; video series and the corresponding &quot;Canta Con Nosotros&quot; title, where it is titled &quot;Al reptil no hay que sonreír&quot;.

Original songs performed in the film include:

===Music releases===
* The 1997 soundtrack release contains the bonus tracks &quot;Never Smile at a Crocodile&quot; (with lyrics) and an early demo recording of &quot;The Boatswain&#x27;s Song&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Peter Pan&quot; premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on February 5, 1953, and was simultaneously released in theaters as a double feature with the &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; documentary short, &quot;Bear Country&quot; (1953). To promote the film, a television special &quot;The Walt Disney Christmas Show&quot; was aired on CBS on December 25, 1951, with Bobby Driscoll and Kathryn Beaumont reprising their roles of Peter Pan and Wendy as live-action characters. A promotional behind-the-scenes featurette &quot;The Peter Pan Story&quot; was released the following year.

During its initial theatrical run, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; grossed $6 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada and $2.6 million internationally.

It also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark Theatres from February 16–18, 2013. To celebrate Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was re-released in theaters across the UK on September 1, 2023, for a week. The movie has earned a lifetime domestic gross of $87.4 million. Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film has had a lifetime gross of $427.5 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Peter Pan&quot; was first released on North American VHS, LaserDisc and Betamax in 1990 and UK VHS in 1993. A THX certified 45th anniversary limited edition of the film was released on March 3, 1998, as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was released on DVD on November 23, 1999 as a part of the Walt Disney Limited Issues series for a limited 60-day time period before going into moratorium. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was re-released as a special-edition VHS and DVD release in 2002 to promote the sequel &quot;Return to Never Land&quot;. The DVD was accompanied with special features including a making-of documentary, a sing-along, a storybook and a still-frame gallery of production artwork.

On March 6, 2007, a Platinum Edition of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was released as a two-disc DVD, containing a new digital restoration of the film. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was re-released on Diamond Edition Blu-ray on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. A DVD and digital copy were also released on August 20, 2013. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was re-released in digital HD format on May 29, 2018 and on Blu-ray on June 5, 2018, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection line, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 65th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
&quot;Peter Pan&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics upon release, some of whom praised the animation but felt it veered too far from the play. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s lack of faithfulness to the original play, claiming it &quot;has the story but not the spirit of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as it was plainly conceived by its author and is usually played on the stage&quot;. Nevertheless, he praised the colors are &quot;more exciting and the technical features of the job, such as the synchronization of voices with the animation of lips, are very good&quot;. However, &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave the film a highly favorable review, writing &quot;it is a lively feature-length Technicolor excursion into a world that glows with an exhilarating charm and a gentle joyousness.&quot; Mae Tinee of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The backgrounds are delightfully picturesque, the music only so-so. The film is designed for broad effect, with the accent of comedy. I&#x27;m sure the youngsters who grow up with cartoons will be right at home with all the characters.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as a &quot;feature cartoon of enchanting quality. The music score is fine, highlighting the constant buzz of action and comedy, but the songs are less impressive than usually encountered in such a Disney presentation.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; felt the film was &quot;another Walt Disney masterpiece. It should prove a delight, not only to children, but also to every adult. The animation is so good that the characters appear almost natural.&quot;

Giving the film stars out of 4, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted the &quot;drawing of Tinkerbelle [&quot;sic&quot;] and the flamboyance of Captain Hook&quot; as well as the &quot;quality music mixed with appropriate animation&quot; were the film&#x27;s major highlights. Michael Jackson cited &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as his favorite film, and from it he derived the name of his estate, Neverland Ranch, in Santa Barbara, California, where he had a private amusement park. Ronald D. Moore, one of the executive producers of the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, has cited this film as the inspiration for the series&#x27; theme of the cyclical nature of time, using the film&#x27;s opening line, &quot;All of this has happened before and it will all happen again&quot;, as a key tenet of the culture&#x27;s scripture. 

===Controversy===
&quot;Peter Pan&quot; has been criticized in recent decades for its broadly stereotypical treatment of Native Americans. 
In 1995, Eric Goldberg, director of that year&#x27;s Disney animated romance &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, expressed his belief that &quot;all the Indians [in the 1953 film] were caricatures&quot;.

In particular, the song &quot;What Made the Red Man Red?&quot; has been removed from television airings of the film and widely described as &quot;racist&quot; since 2014. Its lyrics claim that Native American men are &quot;red&quot; due to &quot;the very first Injun prince&quot; blushing after kissing a &quot;maid&quot;. It also contains usage of the word &quot;squaw&quot;, gibberish utterances like &quot;ugg-a-wugg&quot;, and a mocking explanation of the Lakota greeting &quot;háu&quot;. The visuals include tipis, drumming, tobbacco ceremonial pipes, and the Inuit eskimo kiss. Multiple characters use the word &quot;squaw&quot; throughout the film, in reference to two different Native women as well as protagonist Wendy.

The Native American tribe was not included in the 2002 sequel &quot;Return to Never Land&quot;, but they were included in a tie-in video game and are referenced by a brief shot of Peter Pan flying by a totem pole.

Animator Marc Davis was quoted in the 2007 audio commentary: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure we would have done the Indians if we were making this movie now. And if we had, we wouldn&#x27;t do them the way we did back then.&quot;

In 2021, the film was one of several that Disney limited to viewers 7 years and older on their streaming service Disney+. They cited the film&#x27;s depictions of Native American characters that were &quot;stereotypical&quot; and not &quot;authentic&quot;, and references to them as &quot;redskins&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Disney Fairies===

===Video games===
&quot;Peter Pan: Adventures in Never Land&quot; is an adventure game in which Peter Pan and Tinker Bell are after a hidden treasure, before Captain Hook reach the treasure first.

Neverland is a playable world in both &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, with Tinker Bell appearing as a summon. Both Peter Pan and Tinker Bell appear as a summon in the sequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Neverland also appears as a playable world in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot; and returns as a playable world in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;.

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy, John, Michael and Captain Hook are playable characters in &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, being unlocked during the progress of the main storyline of the game.

===Board game===
&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Peter Pan: A Game of Adventure&quot; (1953) is a Transogram Company Inc. track board game based upon the film. The game was one of many toys that exploited the popularity of Walt Disney&#x27;s post-World War II movies. The object of the game is to be the first player to travel from the Darlings&#x27; house to Neverland and back to the Darlings&#x27; house.

Play begins at the Darlings&#x27; house in the upper left hand corner of the game board. Each player moves, in turn, the number of spaces along the track indicated by his spin of the dial. When a player reaches the Never Isle, he selects a character from the film (Peter, Wendy, Michael, or John) and receives the instruction card for that character. The player follows his chosen character&#x27;s track on the board, obeying instructions upon the character&#x27;s card. The player is also obligated to follow any instructions on those spaces he lands upon after spinning the dial during the course of his turn at play. The first player who travels from Never Land to Skull Rock and along the Stardust Trail to Captain Hook&#x27;s ship, and returns to the Darlings&#x27; house is declared the winner.

The board game makes an appearance in the 1968 version of &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; as a Christmas present.

===Musical===
&quot;Disney&#x27;s Peter Pan Jr&quot; is a one-hour children&#x27;s musical based on the Disney Peter Pan movie with some updated material. It became available for school and children&#x27;s theatre productions in 2013 after several pilot productions.

===Sequels===
This was Disney&#x27;s first &quot;Peter Pan&quot; film. In the early 2000s, a &quot;Peter Pan&quot; franchise was spawned, involving a number of other animated releases. The franchise also included:
* &quot;Peter Pan: Return to Never Land&quot;: Released theatrically in 2002, and a direct-sequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
* The &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; film series: A spin-off and prequel to the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; films. Disneytoon Studios produced a number of &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; films, including six feature-length straight-to-home video films, and two shorts.
* The television series &quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot; includes Hook and Smee as main characters, and is set in Never Land, some time after the events of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Tick-Tock the Crocodile appears as a recurring character in the series. Peter, Tinker Bell, Wendy, Michael and John also appear as guest characters.

===Live-action adaptation===
In April 2016, following the individual financial and critical successes of &quot;Maleficent&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, a number of live-action adaptations of Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; classic animated films were announced to be in development. The Walt Disney Company announced that a live action &quot;Peter Pan&quot; film was in development, with David Lowery serving as director, with a script he co-wrote with Toby Halbrooks. In July 2018, it was reported that the feature length film would be released exclusively on the company&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+. It has since been said that the film may instead get a theatrical release.

In January 2020, casting was underway while the film was retitled &quot;Peter Pan and Wendy&quot;. Joe Roth and Jim Whitaker will serve as producers. Principal photography was scheduled to commence on April 17, 2020, in Canada and in London, United Kingdom. By March, Alexander Molony and Ever Anderson were cast as Peter Pan and Wendy, respectively. Later that month however, filming on all Disney projects were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and industry restrictions worldwide. In July 2020, Jude Law entered early negotiations to portray Captain Hook, and was officially cast two months later. Joaquin Phoenix, Adam Driver, and Will Smith were all previously on the short-list of actors being considered for the role, though each of them ultimately passed on the opportunity. In September 2020, Yara Shahidi was cast as Tinker Bell. In October 2020, Alyssa Wapanatâhk was cast in the role of Tiger Lily. In January 2021, Jim Gaffigan joined the film&#x27;s cast as Mr. Smee. On March 16, 2021, the same day that principal photography officially began, Alan Tudyk, Molly Parker, Joshua Pickering, and Jacobi Jupe were announced to play Mr. Darling, Mrs. Darling, John Darling, and Michael Darling, respectively.

In December 2020, it was announced that the film would be debuting on Disney+. Filming began on March 16, 2021, in Vancouver, Canada, and was expected to wrap on June 30, 2021. Additional filming took place on the Bonavista Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador, in August 2021. &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy&quot; was released on Disney+ on April 28, 2023.

<doc id="982204" wikidata="Q7077519" url="?curid=982204" title="Oddpost">
<text>Oddpost was a pay-for webmail service that debuted in 2002. It pioneered the use of JavaScript to mimic a desktop mail application, the first notable foray into using Ajax methodologies for webmail. Ajax techniques minimized the amount of data sent during an email session by sending &quot;Datapacks&quot; instead of reloading the whole interface on every click like a traditional webmail service (Hotmail, AOL). This made the service much faster, at the time, than its counterparts.

==History==
Oddpost created an interface much like the traditional 3-pane view used by many desktop software applications (namely Microsoft Outlook, Apple&#x27;s Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Mozilla Thunderbird, and others).
Oddpost also had the design philosophy of making the interface invisible, where unread message headers were bolded, so there was no need for an unread message icon next to each message; sub folders were indented under the parent, so there was no need for a little ant trail connecting each folder.

This excerpt from a 2003 interview with Ethan Diamond, Oddpost&#x27;s co-founder and then president, explained this minimalist approach:

Google made extensive use of these ideas in Gmail, which was launched two years later.

Oddpost was also known for its humorous blog entries about feature additions, bug fixes, and random musings about Oddpost.

Some disadvantages of Oddpost were seen to be that it required Windows and Internet Explorer, and that it lacked mail filters and support for secure email.

Oddpost was purchased by Yahoo! on July 9, 2004, and became the new version of their Yahoo! Mail service. On September 14, 2005, Yahoo! Mail started letting some users register to beta test the new Yahoo! Mail web client.

The original Oddpost servers have been shut down, however existing Oddpost customers were able to keep their Oddpost email addresses to be used with Yahoo!.

<text>Isparta is a city in western Turkey. It is the seat of Isparta Province and Isparta District. Its population is 247,580 (2022). Its elevation is 1035 m. It is known as the &quot;City of Roses&quot;.
Isparta is well-connected to other parts of Turkey via roads. Antalya lies 130 km to the south and Eskişehir is 350 km to the north.
Süleyman Demirel University has introduced thousands of youths from varied backgrounds to the city&#x27;s mostly conservative fabric in recent years. The city&#x27;s football team, Ispartaspor, plays in Group 7 of the Turkish Regional Amateur League.
== History ==

===Roman era===
Isparta is a Turkish spelling of Greek &quot;Sparta&quot;, by prothesis declustering.
Isparta was said to correspond to the ancient city of Baris, which is a namesake and was part of the Roman province of Pisidia. A later theory has it instead as the Eastern Roman fortress Saporda; in Muslim sources it appears as Sabarta. GE Bean characterized the situation thus: &quot;These perpetually shifting conceptions leave the reader quite bewildered.&quot; Modern scholars locate Baris near Kılıç, in Keçiborlu district, Isparta province.
At an early stage it became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolitan see of Antioch of Pisidia, the capital of the province. The names of two of its bishops are known with certainty: Heraclius participated in the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and Leo in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In addition, Paulus was at the Council of Constantinople (869) and Stephanus was at the Council of Constantinople (879), but one or both of these may have been of the Baris in the Roman province of Hellespontus. Like most sees in Asia Minor, it faded away.

*1071: Conquered by the Seljuk Turks.
*Late 13th century: Becomes part of the Hamidids.
*1381: Isparta is sold to the Ottoman sultan Murad I by the Hamidid Emir.
*Late 19th century: Muslim refugees from the Balkans settle around Isparta. The Bulgarian refugees brought the knowledge of kazanlik rosewater production with them, leading to Isparta&#x27;s nickname: city of roses.
*1914: According to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Isparta had a total population of 54.465, consisting of 46.698 Muslims, 6.648 Greeks and 1.119 Armenians.
*1923: The Greek inhabitants of the area were forced to move to Greece under the Greco-Turkish population exchange.
===Notable flight crashes===
On 19 September 1976, Turkish Airlines Flight 452, a Boeing 727 aircraft, crashed on a hill in Isparta, also known Mount Karatepe, killing all 154 passengers and crew.
On 30 November 2007, Atlasjet Flight 4203 crashed on approach to Isparta Süleyman Demirel Airport, killing all 57 passengers and crew.
==Titular see==
No longer a residential bishopric, &#x27;Baris in Pisidia&#x27; is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular bishopric, nominal suffragan of Nicomedia, since the diocese was nominally restored in 1933: Latin adjective Baren(us) in Pisidia (Latin). It has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:
* Alfred Bertram Leverman (1948.04.24 – 1953.07.27) as Auxiliary Bishop of Halifax (Canada) (1948.04.24 – 1953.07.27); later Bishop of Saint John, New Brunswick (Canada) (1953.07.27 – 1968.09.07), emeritate as Titular Bishop of Altava (1968.09.07 – death 1972.04.28)
* José de Almeida Batista Pereira (1953.12.22 – 1955.11.07) as Auxiliary Bishop of Niterói (Brazil) (1953.12.22 – 1955.11.07), Bishop of Sete Lagoas (Brazil) (1955.11.07 – 1964.04.02), Bishop of Guaxupé (Brazil) (1964.04.02 – retired 1976.01.16); died 2009
* António Cardoso Cunha (1956.03.09 – 1967.01.10), first as Auxiliary Bishop of Beja (Portugal) (1956.03.09 – 1965), then as Coadjutor Bishop of Vila Real (Portugal) (1965 – 1967.01.10), next succeeded as Bishop of Vila Real (1967.01.10 – retired 1991.01.19), died 2004.
== Economy ==
The main economic activities of Isparta are the production of rosewater and handmade carpets. Tourism, both local and increasingly international due to &quot;biblical tourism&quot;, is becoming an important source of revenue.
In the early 20th century, carpetmaking was a major industry in Isparta.
== Climate ==
Isparta has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), or a temperate continental climate (Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Dc&quot;). Winters are chilly, rainy and often snowy, summers are hot and dry. The lakes around the city have an important moderating influence on the climate. Precipitation occurs mostly in the winter months, with a notable decrease in summer.
== Sights ==
The city lies close to a fault line and is thus prone to violent earthquakes.
Most of the ancient city was destroyed by an earthquake 1914. So there are only a few historical buildings left. The oldest building is the &quot;Kutlu Bey Mosque&quot; (or &quot;Ulu Camii&quot;, which means great Mosque), built in 1429 by Kutlu Bey, a general of Sultan Murad II. It was very badly destroyed by the earthquake 1914, but restored 1922.
Famous is the &quot;Firdevs-Bey-Camii&quot; (Mosque) (also: &quot;Firdevs Paşa Camii&quot;, &quot;Mimar Sinan Camii&quot;) from 1561. The mosque and the neighboring &quot;Bedesten&quot; (market hall) are attributed to the architect Sinan. Badly damaged by earthquake in 1914, it was renovated afterwards.
Most of the churches have been destroyed, only a few remain, especially the &quot;Aya Payana Church&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Aya Baniya Kilisesi&quot;); a Greek-Orthodox church from 1750. In a state of ruin since 1923, the roof was re-covered in 1999. Another renovation is planned but has not yet been carried out (as of 2022) 

The city also has a museum.

<doc id="982207" wikidata="Q7945546" url="?curid=982207" title="W. Fred Turner">
<text>Winton Frederick Turner (April 17, 1922 – November 23, 2003) was an American attorney. He successfully defended Clarence Earl Gideon in his retrial after the 1963 Supreme Court case of &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; overturned his first conviction. The story behind this case was told in Anthony Lewis&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot;. There was also a 1980 made-for-TV film called &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; in which Lane Smith played Turner and Henry Fonda played Gideon.

Turner was born in Millville, Florida, now part of Panama City. He joined the Army Air Corps, the precursor to the present-day Air Force, after high school and was a supply officer in the 308th Bombardment Group during World War II. He rose to the rank of captain before leaving for the University of Florida in Gainesville. After graduating in 1948, he returned to Bay County to practice law.

== Gideon&#x27;s case ==
Clarence Earl Gideon was a drifter convicted of petty theft from a pool hall; at the trial he was denied a lawyer. His appeal to the Supreme Court was accepted, and the decision ordered that counsel be provided in all criminal cases. Gideon&#x27;s conviction was not overturned, but he was to be tried again.

Gideon chose Turner to be his lawyer for his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, five months after the Supreme Court ruling. By destroying the credibility of the prosecution&#x27;s key witness through exposing contradictions with other eyewitnesses and the witness&#x27;s self-admittedly false statements (such as about his prior criminal record), Turner won an acquittal for Gideon. The jury acquitted Gideon after one hour of deliberation.

== After &quot;Gideon&quot; ==
Turner worked as a private attorney until 1979, when he was appointed and subsequently elected to a circuit judge seat. He retired from the bench in 1991 at age 70. His wife Helen died in 1997. Turner died in 2003 at age 81 at his home in Panama City.

He was survived by three children and three grandchildren.

<doc id="982219" wikidata="Q1033220" url="?curid=982219" title="Massachusetts Route 2">
<text>Route 2 is a major east–west state highway in Massachusetts, United States. Along with Route 9 and U.S. Route 20 to the south, these highways are the main alternatives to the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 toll highway. Route 2 runs the entire length of the northern tier of Massachusetts, beginning at the New York border, where it connects with New York State Route 2, and ending near Boston Common in Boston. Older alignments of Route 2 are known as Route 2A.

==Route description==

=== Berkshire and Franklin counties ===
Route 2 proceeds east from the New York state line on a winding, scenic path in Berkshire County through Williamstown, where it serves the Williams College area, and through North Adams, where it serves the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. East of North Adams, Route 2 ascends via a hairpin turn into the Hoosac Range along what is known as the Mohawk Trail.

Route 2 then enters Franklin County, meeting Interstate 91 at an interchange in Greenfield and briefly runs concurrently with I-91. While the old Route 2 becomes Route 2A and goes through downtown Greenfield, Route 2 joins I-91 in a short concurrency before leaving it and becoming a two-lane freeway. Outside Greenfield, Route 2A temporarily ends and merges with Route 2, and Route 2’s freeway section ends. Route 2 remains a two-lane surface road in Gill and Millers Falls (though it does have an interchange with Route 63). The road in Erving was routed to the north and straightened to avoid the paper mill next to the river. This rerouting led to the road being shortened by less than one-tenth of a mile.

=== Orange–Cambridge ===
As the route approaches Orange, Route 2A resumes and diverges from Route 2. At this point, Route 2 again becomes a two-lane freeway. In Orange, Route 2 runs concurrently with U.S. Route 202. The road at this point enters the town of Athol in Worcester County. After its eastern interchange in Phillipston when US-202 departs to the north, Route 2 becomes a four-lane freeway, though not to Interstate standards at most points. It continues through Gardner into Fitchburg where Route 2 has several at-grade intersections with Oak Hill Rd, Palmer Rd, Mt. Elam Rd and Abbott Ave. At the intersection with Mt. Elam Rd, a traffic light remains in use on the eastbound side. Continuing east into Leominster, Interstate 190 splits off, heading south to Worcester.

Route 2 continues east to Middlesex County and enters Boston&#x27;s outer loop at the interchange with Interstate 495 in Littleton. It continues into Acton, where Route 2 reduces its speed to 45 miles per hour, and becomes a four-lane expressway with at-grade intersections. At the Concord Rotary, a major traffic choke point, Route 2 becomes a four-lane surface road and intersects with Route 2A and the eastern terminus of Route 119 (which is concurrent with Route 2A). After the rotary, the road passes by the State Police (who have an emergency-only traffic light) and over the Assabet River. Route 2A formerly broke away from Route 2 at the next traffic light to go left into Concord but is now overlaid with Route 2, where it becomes a four-lane expressway again. At Crosby&#x27;s Corner, the sixth intersection after the rotary, Route 2A exits under the highway while Route 2 veers right (but still heads east). After a signalized at-grade intersection with Bedford Road in Lincoln, the highway becomes a four-lane arterial road.

Route 2 enters Lexington and heads to Boston&#x27;s inner belt, and as it crosses Interstate 95/Route 128, it becomes a six-lane freeway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. In Belmont, Route 2 remains a six-lane freeway, and then becomes an eight-lane freeway at Exit 132 (formerly 57) in Arlington, where U.S. Route 3 would have joined it from the north. At Exit 135 (formerly 60), the freeway narrows in width to six lanes. The section of freeway from Route 128 to the Cambridge line meets the standards of an interstate highway. The highway enters Cambridge, the highway reduces its speed limit back to 45 miles per hour and becomes a five-lane freeway (three lanes heading east, two lanes heading west), with a strip of residential and transit-oriented development on its eastbound side, including an off-ramp that serves the MBTA Alewife Station, Cambridge Discovery Park and development to the south and west of the station. After the Alewife exit, the highway narrows again to four lanes.

=== Cambridge and Boston ===

The highway then meets a large at-grade intersection with Routes 3 and 16, where Route 2 east merges with U.S. Route 3 south and Route 16 and continues as a four-lane, 35 mile per hour arterial road — managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation — for the rest of its time in Cambridge. Route 2 follows Alewife Brook Parkway and Fresh Pond Parkway along its wrong way concurrency with Routes 3 and 16, before Route 16 heads west into Watertown. Route 2 and Route 3 concurrently start paralleling the Charles River as Memorial Drive, passing by Harvard University’s campus. It then heads southward on the Boston University Bridge into Boston proper, as it separates from Route 3. It winds through the Boston University campus as Mountfort Street and crosses over both the Massachusetts Turnpike and Commonwealth Avenue before heading due east towards Kenmore Square, while running parallel to U.S. Route 20. Immediately east of the Boston University campus, it crosses into Kenmore Square, which is also the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 20. From Kenmore Square, Route 2 follows Commonwealth Ave to Arlington St. It circles the Boston Public Garden, using Arlington, Boylston, and Charles Streets.
Route 2 east goes along northbound Route 28 north at the intersection of Charles and Beacon Streets between Boston Common and the Boston Public Garden. As Route 28 north joins Storrow Drive, which shortly after would join Route 3, Route 28 south joins Route 2 and completes the loop around Boston Public Garden.

==History==
The route amalgamates and supersedes various named highways in some cases going back to the pre-automobile era. For example, parts of Route 2 are sometimes known as the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike and the Mohawk Trail.
In the early 1920s, Route 2 was known as New England Interstate Route 7 (NE-7), a major road in the New England road marking system connecting Boston with Troy, New York. NE-7 ran roughly where Route 2A (the original surface alignment of Route 2) does now except near the New York state line. NE-7 used current Massachusetts Route 43, New York State Route 43 and New York State Route 66 to reach Troy. Current Route 2 from Williamstown to Petersburgh was previously numbered as Route 96.

Route 2 connected as a highway in its current right-of-way at Alewife Brook Parkway at some point before 1937.

An upgraded Route 2 was originally planned to continue as Boston&#x27;s Northwest Expressway (merging with a re-routed U.S. Route 3 at the Arlington-Lexington or Arlington-Cambridge border) to a junction with Interstate 695, the Inner Beltway, but this, along with the Inner Beltway itself, was cancelled in 1970, accounting for the abrupt narrowing at Alewife. In place of the highway project, the MBTA Red Line was extended from Harvard to Alewife in the 1980s.

The Leominster to Ayer section opened on July 3, 1953, completing the expressway portion from Westminster to West Concord. Full grade separation between Route 128 and Alewife Brook Parkway was completed around 1970.

===Crosby&#x27;s Corner intersection===

This major project has been planned since 1999. The intersection had an average of 90 accidents a year. The project was intended to solve the traffic and safety problems that had long occurred at the Crosby&#x27;s Corner intersection (junction of Route 2 and 2A) in Concord. The project, which was expected to cost $71.9 million, widened Route 2 from Bedford Rd in Lincoln to 300 feet west of Sandy Pond Rd in Concord. The project eliminated the at grade intersection, realigned Route 2, and constructed new entrance and exit ramps along with new service roads next to Route 2.

The full project included building a new overpass bridge over Route 2 and building multiple service roads next to Route 2. Work also consisted of a new signalized intersection. The project was put out to bid for contractors on September 19, 2011. A contractor was expected to be chosen over the winter and construction was expected to begin in Spring 2012 on the estimated $55 million project.

The Army Corps of Engineers published a notice for this project, because of its impact on wetlands at Crosby&#x27;s Corner. During the summer of 2012, activity on this portion of Route 2 included surveying and the installation of orange-painted stakes. Signs were added in January 2013 indicating that construction would start on January 14. As of April 2014 the project was underway and predicted completion was spring 2016. The project was completed in 2016, with a large improvement in traffic flow.

==Future==
A project to improve the Concord Rotary, at the convergence of Route 2, Route 2A/119 (Elm Street), Barrett&#x27;s Mill Road and Commonwealth Avenue, has been in planning since 2003 or even earlier. More than 61,000 cars use this rotary on a typical day, and the backed up traffic can be significant. The improved intersection would include overpasses for local streets, while Route 2 traffic would continue unimpeded at grade. However, the project was removed from the funded portion of the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization&#x27;s (MPO) Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) in August 2009 and is currently on hold.

==Major intersections==
MassDOT was scheduled to replace the old sequential exit numbers with the new milepost-based exit numbers beginning in summer 2020, which had been delayed since 2016. On March 16, 2021, MassDOT announced that the Route 2 exit numbers would get renumbered for four weeks starting on March 23.

<text>Adam d&#x27;Ambergau was a German compositor (one who sets words into type for printing) who lived at the end of the 15th century.

Adam d&#x27;Ambergau was probably born in Ammergau, Upper Bavaria. Neither his place of birth, nor his residence have been precisely recorded and can only be reconstructed from his prints. There exists a print of the Virgil signed &quot;Adam, Venice 1471&quot;, and an edition of Cicero&#x27;s talks signed &quot;Adam d&#x27;Ambergau, Venice 1472&quot;. However the types in both prints are different, therefore it may be possible that two compositors of the name of Adam have lived in Venice at the same time.

The name Adam is found repeatedly in the following years: A &quot;Magister Adamus&quot; publishes in 1470 &quot;Augustini Dati elegantiae&quot; in 4°. Also known are other printers using the names &quot;Petrus Adamus Mantuanus&quot;, &quot;Adam Rost&quot; (Rome, 1471-1475) and &quot;Adam de Rotwil&quot; (Aquila, 1482). The common use to only use the first name, sometimes with an added place of birth in Latin, makes it difficult to ascertain the identity of the printers of this time.

<text>Rover Dangerfield is a 1991 American animated musical comedy film starring the voice talent of comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who also wrote the screenplay and story and co-produced the film. It revolves around the eponymous character, a canine facsimile of Dangerfield owned by a Las Vegas showgirl, who gets dumped off the Hoover Dam and finds himself living on a farm. Critical reception was unfavorable, although its animation received minor praise.

==Plot==
Rover Dangerfield is a Basset Hound living the life of luxury in Las Vegas with his owner Connie, a showgirl. One night, he sees Connie&#x27;s duplicitous boyfriend Rocky negotiating with a pair of gangsters, and accidentally disrupts it by dropping a bone into the meeting. Thinking Rocky is an undercover cop setting them up, the gangsters flee as their boss tells Rocky that he has blown his last chance. When Connie goes on tour for two weeks, she leaves Rover in the care of Rocky. In retaliation for ruining his deal, Rocky stuffs Rover in a bag, drives him to Hoover Dam and throws him into the water.

The bag is later pulled out of the water by two passing fishermen, who take Rover back to shore and place him in the back of their pickup truck. Rover regains consciousness, jumps out of the truck during a stop, and begins wandering down the road. He ends up in the countryside, and encounters a farmer, Cal, and his son, Danny. Danny convinces his father to take the dog in. Cal agrees on one condition: if he causes trouble, he will be sent to an animal shelter. Rover has difficulty adjusting to life on the farm but with the help of Daisy, a beautiful collie next door, and the other dogs on the farm, he succeeds in earning their trust. Rover spends Christmas with the family, and begins to fall in love with Daisy.

A pack of wolves attempt to kill a turkey on the farm. Rover saves the turkey, but the bird ends up dead from shock. Cal mistakenly believes Rover to be responsible for the turkey&#x27;s death, and takes Rover into the woods to shoot him the next morning. The wolves appear and attack Cal, Rover fights off the wolves, and then rallies the other farm dogs to get the injured Cal home. Rover&#x27;s heroics make the papers; Connie discovers Rover&#x27;s whereabouts and travels to the farm to pick him up and take him back to Las Vegas. Although initially satisfied to be reunited with Connie and his old friends, Rover soon begins to miss his life on the farm. Rocky comes into Connie&#x27;s dressing room, and accidentally confesses to her what he did to Rover, causing Connie to break up with him. Infuriated, Rocky tries to retaliate, but Rover and friends chase him out of the casino, where he is beckoned into the gangsters&#x27; limo, presumably taken to be thrown off the Hoover Dam.

Sometime later, Rover, missing Daisy, becomes despondent. Understanding that he misses his new life, Connie takes Rover back to the farm to stay, allowing Cal and Danny to keep him. Rover is reunited with Daisy, who leads him to the barn, revealing that he is now a father of six puppies: five of them resembling Rover and one resembling Daisy. The story ends with Rover teaching his kids how to play cards and happily chasing Daisy around the farmyard.

==Voice cast==
Additional voices by Bob Bergen, Louise Chamis, Bill Farmer, Barbara Goodson, Patricia Parris, Burton Sharp, and Ross Taylor

==Production==
Conceived in the late 1980s, the film was the brainchild of Rodney Dangerfield, and planned at the time for a December 1988 release. It was originally planned as an R-rated animated film, in the vein of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s films, but Warner Bros. wanted the film&#x27;s content to be toned down to a G-rating. Initially, the film was to be directed by animator Steve Moore, who worked alongside Rebecca Rees on further developing the script written by Harold Ramis attributed to Dangerfield. He would soon be initially fired by Dangerfield, who wanted him to produce the script as is with no further revisions. Ultimately, Moore remained onboard the project as a sequence director. Ramis left the project not soon long after Moore&#x27;s demotion. Cartoonist Jeff Smith, best known as the creator of the self-published comic book series &quot;Bone&quot;, described working on key frames for the film&#x27;s animation to editor Gary Groth in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; in 1994. Although he admitted he had fun working on the film, he would describe the film itself as &quot;terrible&quot;.

The film was preceded in theaters by a re-issue of the 1958 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot;. A newly-produced &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short, &quot;(Blooper) Bunny&quot;, was originally intended to accompany &quot;Rover Dangerfield&quot; in its theatrical release, but that short was shelved due to what Warners considered irreverent satirical content (some of it aimed at the studio).

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film a &#x27;C&#x27;, questioning Dangerfield&#x27;s decision to make the film and said, &#x27;Dangerfield should have known he had written a no-win scenario. His strongest suit — that gleeful lounge-act vulgarity — has always been a little too crass for kids. Yet when Rover offers gooey, sentimental life lessons, it feels unconvincing, like a rock star in a suit. This mongrel-movie badly wants to be a kidvid hit, and with that star and decent animation chops, it stands a chance. But don&#x27;t bet the farm on it.&#x27; &quot;TV Guide&quot; awarded the film two stars, criticizing the tone and inconsistent animation, and said, &#x27;The result is a confused hybrid creation, suspended in a twilight zone between Don Bluth&#x27;s benign but dull children&#x27;s fare and Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s gratingly hip work.&#x27;

&quot;Screen Rant&quot;, on the other hand, listed &quot;Rover Dangerfield&quot; as a must-see performance for its star, stating that:

&quot;To hear Dangerfield voice an animated version of himself is quite funny, and the film, while no classic, is completely watchable due to Dangerfield&#x27;s fresh and entertaining voice-performance&quot;.

==Home video==
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc on February 12, 1992. Warner Archive Collection released the film on DVD, and Blu-ray on January 30, 2024.

==In popular culture==
Rover Dangerfield appears in a pound in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Woof of Wall Street.&quot;

<text>&#x27; (; The Luncheon on the Grass) – originally titled Le Bain&quot;&quot;&#x27; (&quot;The Bath&quot;) – is a large oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet created in 1862 and 1863.

It depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés, where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy. The work increased Manet&#x27;s fame; in spite of this it nonetheless failed to sell at its debut.
The work is now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris. A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.

==Description and context==
The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young dandies, sit with her. In front of them, the woman&#x27;s clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a still life. In the background, yet too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.

Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 × 104.1 in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious and mythological subjects. The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of Cabanel or Ingres.

A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences&#x27; sense of propriety, though Émile Zola, a contemporary of Manet&#x27;s, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the Louvre. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently from the perspective of &quot;analytic&quot; painters like Manet, who use a painting&#x27;s subject as a pretext to paint.

There is much not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, how he got the idea and how and what sort of preparatory works he did. Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 francs in 1871, it remained in his possession until 1878 when Jean-Baptiste Faure, opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.

==Figures in the painting==
The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to . Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be l&#x27;Île Saint-Ouen, which was just up the Seine from his family property in Gennevilliers. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process. The female nude is thought to be Victorine Meurent, the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of &quot;Olympia&quot;. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor Ferdinand Leenhoff. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet&#x27;s family portrait.

==Interactions of the figures==
What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman. Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman&#x27;s gaze.

==Inspirations==
As with the later &quot;Olympia&quot; (1863) and other works, Manet&#x27;s composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi&#x27;s engraving &quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot; () after a drawing by Raphael. Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the École des Beaux-Arts, where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. &quot;Le Bain&quot; (an early title for ) was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the Renaissance into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.

Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet&#x27;s painting : &quot;The Pastoral Concert&quot; by Giorgione or possibly Titian (in the Louvre) and Giorgione&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, both of which are famous Renaissance paintings. &quot;The Tempest&quot;, which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet&#x27;s painting . &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; even more closely resembles &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe,&quot; as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; is in the collection of the Louvre in Paris and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.

According to Antonin Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, &quot;I copied Giorgione&#x27;s women, the women with musicians. It&#x27;s black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there.&quot;

There may be a connection between and the work of Antoine Watteau. Manet&#x27;s original title, &quot;Le Bain&quot;, initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau&#x27;s &quot;La Villageoise&quot;, as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It is possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his, years before his creation of .

==Criticism==
There were many mixed reviews and responses to when it was first displayed and it continues to yield a variety of responses. The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the Salon des Refusés. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative.
* Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.
* Le Capitaine Pompilius, a contributor for &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, thought the characteristically &quot;male&quot; colors of the piece brought the countryside into the salon, but thought the painting was underdeveloped.
* Castagnary, appreciator of realist works, identified it as a nice sketch but said it lacked sincerity and lost the definition of the anatomy of the subjects. He also described Manet&#x27;s painting technique as &quot;flabby&quot;.
* Arthur Stevens, contributor for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, praised Manet as a talented colorist but felt that he neglected form and modeling in this piece.
* Thoré, Paul, and Louvet loved the energy of the colors but found the brush strokes to be uneven.

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.

=== Criticism of the subject matter ===
* Louis Étienne characterized the painting as a puzzle, while describing the nude female as &quot;a Bréda of some sort, as nude as possible, lolling boldly between two swells dressed to the teeth. These two persons look like high school students on holiday, committing a great sin to prove their manhood.&quot;
* Arthur Stevens could not understand what the painting was saying.
* Didier de Montchaux found the subject to be &quot;fairly scabrous&quot;.
* Thoré described the nude as an ugly and risqué subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one &quot;who doesn&#x27;t even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors ... It&#x27;s the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking.&quot;
* Philip Hamerton, an English painter and contributor at the &quot;Fine Arts Quarterly&quot;, had an affinity for the characteristic photographic detail of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings. Though he did recognize the inspiration from Giorgione, he found Manet&#x27;s modern realism to be offensive in this situation. His disapproval of Manet and similar artists was related to the idea of indecency behind &quot;vulgar men&quot; painting nude women.

Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Anne McCauley claimed that laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.

==Commentary of Émile Zola==
&quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.

Zola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his 1886 novel &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; (&quot;The Masterpiece&quot;).

== Inspired works==

* In &quot;L&#x27;Oeuvre&quot;, Émile Zola&#x27;s 1886 novel about a painter, a work by his main character, Claude Lantier, exhibited in a fictional salon des refusés, resembles Manet&#x27;s painting.

* Claude Monet&#x27;s own version of from 1865–1866, was inspired by Manet&#x27;s painting. After Monet finished his painting, Manet was conscious of that artwork and renamed his own artwork &quot;Le Bain&quot; to &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; in 1867.
* French painter James Tissot, painted &quot;La Partie Carrée&quot;, in 1870; arguably a tamer version without the nudity of .

* Paul Cézanne painted the same theme in his (1876–1877), Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie, Paris. It is not certain, however, that Cézanne was responsible for the title of the work, but it does incorporate many of the same elements of subject in the piece. For example, Cézanne&#x27;s clothed female subject poses similarly to the model of Manet in which her chin rests in her hand. The male figure, meant to resemble the painter himself, mimics the hand gesture of the man furthest right in Manet&#x27;s piece. The composition of Cézanne&#x27;s painting also bears resemblance to &quot;Bacchanal&quot; (between 1627 and 1628), by Nicolas Poussin, whose works in the Louvre were periodically copied by Cézanne. It is possible that Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Déjeuner&quot; represents nothing more than the joyful memories of outings in the countryside around Aix-en-Provence, known especially from the testimony of a childhood friend of the painter, Émile Zola.

* Manet&#x27;s painting inspired Picasso as he completed the largest concentration of art prompted by a single work during the 20th century, consisting of 27 paintings, 140 drawings, 3 linogravures and cardboard marquettes for sculpture carried out between 1949 and 1962. In addition, &quot;Picasso exploited the foreground nude again for the masked female on the right in his groundbreaking &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; of 1907&quot;.
* Paul Gauguin 1897 painting &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot; &quot;includes various references to Manet&#x27;s picture, the most apparent being the Tahitian girl seated on the right who is based on the &quot;Déjeuner&#x27;s&quot; foreground nude&quot;.
* Max Ernst painted a parody version of this piece named &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;Herbre&quot; in 1944. He inverts the painting, replaces the nude woman with a fish, and adds an &#x27;r&#x27; to the title for comedic effect.
* The painting inspired the 1959 film of the same name by Jean Renoir.
* Alain Jacquet copied in 1964 the composition of Manet in his &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;:, a serie of 95 serigraphies portraying the art critic Pierre Restany and the painter Mario Schifano, one of which was left in the lobby of the hotel Chelsea in New York City for payment of his room.
*Peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega produced many works inspired by this painting. One of the first, &quot;Les invités sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;, 1970, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de Paris, is a mix between &quot;Las Meninas&quot; by Velazquez and Le &quot;déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; by Manet, which features Picasso and Velasquez as naked guests. It is a tribute to Picasso who produced both a series of paintings inspired by &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; and an other series inspired by &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. It also is part of a series called &quot;Picasso dans un déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; described as &quot;seriously hilarious&quot; by art critic John Canaday. Later Braun-Vega produced other inspired works like &quot;Encore un déjeuner sur le sable&quot;,1984, where he pictures himself in place of one of the characters. This work as the following ones is typical of the syncretism that characterizes the work of Braun-Vega from the 80s. He mixes contemporary characters (mainly south american ones) with Manet&#x27;s characters as he does in &quot;Cita en el campo&quot; and &quot;Cita en la Playa&quot; in 1985; &quot;Fin d&#x27;un déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Picnic en el Patio&quot; in 1988, showing critical irony about his time as in &quot;I love the neutron bomb&quot;, lithography,1986. He also moves the scene to Central Park for his 1999 New-York exhibition with, &quot;Le déjeuner in Central Park&quot; (Château Malescasse collection).
* New Jazz Orchestra released the album titled &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;Herbe&quot; in 1968 and its cover shows a photograph resembling Manet&#x27;s painting. Dave Gelly&#x27;s liner notes for the 2014 CD reissue assert that the cover photograph &quot;was inspired by a Picasso lithograph of the famous Monet painting&quot;; it is not clear if this attribution comes from Gelly himself or one of his sources.
* It was copied in the cover photo of the Bow Wow Wow LP &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!&quot;, and the EP &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Controversy arose because the naked girl (lead singer Annabella Lwin) was only 14 at the time.
*It was also parodied by Neon Park in the cover of Lowell George&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Thanks I&#x27;ll Eat It Here&quot; with Marlene Dietrich, Fidel Castro and Bob Dylan as the diners.
*Priit Pärn used the painting as the basis of the 1987 short film &quot;Eine murul&quot; (Breakfast on the Grass), depicting the day that led to the four subjects of the original painting meeting for their luncheon.
*Mickalene Thomas has produced (2010)&quot;.&quot; The painting is both a critique of and reference to . Thomas&#x27; piece portrays three bold, black women adorned with rich colors, patterned clothing, and radiant Afro-styled hair; the women&#x27;s positioning and posing is reminiscent of the subjects of Manet&#x27;s piece, but the gazes of all three women are fixed on the viewer. Thomas created the painting, her largest piece at the time, in 2010 after being commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.
*Gilbert Shelton parodied it for the cover of &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; comic #3.

<text>The rubble trench foundation, an ancient construction approach popularized by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, is a type of foundation that uses loose stone or rubble to minimize the use of concrete and improve drainage. It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments are not suitable for this kind of foundation, particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (&lt; 1 ton/sf) soils. A rubble trench foundation with a concrete grade beam is not recommended for earthquake prone areas.

A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once.

To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the frost line. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1&quot;:8&#x27; to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2&quot;) or recycled rubble. A steel-reinforced concrete grade beam may be poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure.

If an insulated slab is to be poured inside the grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS foam board, which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation.

The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and environment-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer&#x27;s approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

<text>The Polar Express is a 1985 fantasy children&#x27;s picture book written and illustrated by American author Chris Van Allsburg. The book is now widely considered to be a classic Christmas story for young children. It was praised for its detailed illustrations and calm, relaxing storyline. For the work, Van Allsburg won the annual Caldecott Medal for illustration of an American children&#x27;s picture book in 1986, his second after &quot;Jumanji&quot;.

The book is set partially in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the author&#x27;s home town, and was inspired in part by Van Allsburg&#x27;s memories of visiting the Herpolsheimer&#x27;s and Wurzburg&#x27;s department stores as a child. It was adapted as a motion-capture film in 2004 starring Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis. Van Allsburg served as an executive producer on the film.

==Plot summary==
On Christmas Eve, a young boy, listening from his bed for the ringing sounds of Santa&#x27;s sleigh, instead hears the sound of a train. He looks through the window to see it right outside his house. He sees a conductor who looks up at his window. He tiptoes downstairs and goes outside. The conductor explains that the train is called the Polar Express and is journeying to the North Pole. The boy then boards the train, which is filled with other children in their pajamas and nightgowns. They all sing carols and are served candies and hot chocolate by the train&#x27;s staff.

The Polar Express races north past towns and villages, through boreal forests, and over mountains, but the train never slows down. When it arrives at the North Pole, the conductor explains that Santa Claus will select one of them to receive the first gift of Christmas.

The boy and the other children see thousands of elves gathered at the center of town waiting to send Santa Claus on his way. The boy is handpicked by Santa to receive the first gift of Christmas. Realizing he could choose anything in the world, the boy asks for a bell from Santa&#x27;s sleigh. An elf cuts a bell from one of the reindeer&#x27;s harnesses. The boy places the bell in the pocket of his robe and all the children watch as Santa takes off into the night for his annual deliveries. As the train begins the ride home, the boy discovers that the bell had fallen through a hole in his pocket. The boy arrives home, the conductor wishing him a merry Christmas as the train speeds away.

On Christmas morning, his sister Sarah finds a small box for the boy behind the tree. The boy opens the box and discovers that it contains the bell, delivered by Santa along with a note explaining that he found it on the seat of his sleigh and to get the hole in his pocket fixed. When the boy rings the bell, both he and his sister marvel at the beautiful sound. His parents, however, are unable to hear the bell and remark that it is broken. The book ends with the following line:

==Development==
Van Allsburg based the story on a mental image of a child wandering into the woods on a foggy night and wondering where a train was headed.

At the premiere of the film, Van Allsburg stated that Pere Marquette 1225, a 2-8-4 Berkshire N-1 class steam locomotive, formerly owned by the Michigan State University and now owned by the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, was the inspiration for the storyline. He played on the engine as a child when it was on display and was inspired by the number, which to him was 12/25 – Christmas Day. The real 1225 was used to create the CGI version of it in the film.

==Reception==
In 1986, &quot;The Polar Express&quot; was awarded the Caldecott Medal and appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. By 1989, a million copies had been sold – more each year than the last – and the book had made the bestseller list four years in a row.
Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. It was one of the &quot;Top 100 Picture Books&quot; of all time in a 2012 poll by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

&quot;The Polar Express&quot; is a 2004 American animated film based on the book. Written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film features human characters animated using the live action performance capture technique.

The film stars Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, Michael Jeter, Eddie Deezen and Tom Hanks. The film was first released in both conventional and IMAX 3D theaters November 10, 2004, and grossed $307 million worldwide.

== Rail tours ==
&quot;The Polar Express&quot; has inspired real-life train rides across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom based on the book and film. These train rides are hosted by a number of different railways, including the Grand Canyon Railway, the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, the Texas State Railroad, the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan, the Valley Railroad in Connecticut, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad in Frostburg, Maryland, and others. Beginning in 2016, the UK&#x27;s Telford Steam Railway offered the Polar Express ride on a steam engine.

The round-trip journey to the &quot;North Pole&quot; includes a live musical performance, hot cocoa and cookies, and Christmas characters such as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. At some locations, guests are invited to wear pajamas, similar to the characters in the book.

<text>A condyle (; , from ; κόνδυλος knuckle) is the round prominence at the end of a bone, most often part of a joint – an articulation with another bone. It is one of the markings or features of bones, and can refer to:
* On the femur, in the knee joint:
** Medial condyle
** Lateral condyle
* On the tibia, in the knee joint:
** Medial condyle
** Lateral condyle
* On the humerus, in the elbow joint:
** Condyle of humerus &quot;(Condylus humeri)&quot;
* On the mandible, in the temporomandibular joint:
** Mandibular condyle
* On the occipital bone, in the atlanto-occipital joint:
** Occipital condyles

Although not generally termed condyles, the trochlea and capitulum of the humerus act as condyles in the elbow, and the femur head acts as a condyle in the hip joint.

&quot;Condyle&quot; may also be used to describe an intrusion of the endocarp into the seed cavity of flowering plants like Abuta.

<doc id="982243" wikidata="Q2165639" url="?curid=982243" title="Watership Down (film)">
<text>Watership Down is a 1978 British animated adventure-drama film, written, produced and directed by Martin Rosen and based on the 1972 novel by Richard Adams. It was financed by a consortium of British financial institutions and was distributed by Cinema International Corporation in the United Kingdom. Released on 19 October 1978, the film was an immediate success and it became the sixth-most popular film of 1979 at the UK box office.

It features the voices of John Hurt, Richard Briers, Harry Andrews, Simon Cadell, Nigel Hawthorne and Roy Kinnear, among others, and was the last film work of Zero Mostel, as the voice of Kehaar the gull. The musical score was by Angela Morley and Malcolm Williamson. Art Garfunkel&#x27;s hit song &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; was written by songwriter Mike Batt. Since release, the film has gained a cult following.

==Plot==
In Lapine language mythology, the world was created by the god Frith. All animals were grass eaters, living harmoniously. The rabbits multiplied, and their appetite led to a food shortage. Frith ordered the rabbit prince, El-Ahrairah, to control his people, but was scoffed at. In retaliation, Frith gave special gifts to every animal, making some into predators to hunt the rabbits. Satisfied that El-Ahrairah had learned his lesson, Frith gave rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning.

In the present, in a warren near Sandleford, a rabbit seer named Fiver has an apocalyptic vision when he and his older brother Hazel come across a signboard; it says a residential development is coming, but they cannot read it. The two beg the chief rabbit to order an evacuation; the chief dismisses them, and orders Captain Holly, the head of the warren&#x27;s Owsla police force, to stop those trying to leave. Fiver and Hazel manage to escape with six other rabbits named Bigwig (an Owsla officer who deserts), Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, and Violet.

They journey through the woods, avoiding several dangerous situations; until Violet – the group&#x27;s only doe – is killed by a hawk. The others eventually meet a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites them to his warren, where a farmer leaves Cowslip&#x27;s group ample vegetables. They are grateful, but Fiver leaves when he senses something unsettling in the atmosphere. Bigwig follows, berating Fiver for causing tension. When Bigwig is caught in a snare, his friends manage to free him, and Fiver realizes that the farmer is protecting and feeding Cowslip&#x27;s warren so that he can snare rabbits for his own meals. The group returns to its journey.

The rabbits discover Nuthanger Farm, which contains a hutch of domesticated does. Before they can free the females, the farm cat and dog chase them away. Later, they are found by Captain Holly, who recounts the destruction of Sandleford by humans as well as an encounter with vicious rabbits called the &quot;Efrafans&quot;. Fiver finally finds the hill he envisioned, Watership Down, where the group settles in with Hazel as their new chief.

The rabbits soon befriend an injured black-headed seagull named Kehaar, who flies out in search of does. That night, the rabbits return to Nuthanger Farm to attempt to free the does, but Hazel&#x27;s is shot in the leg and the rest are forced to retreat. Fiver follows a vision of the mythical Black Rabbit to his injured brother. Kehaar returns and, while pecking out buckshot from Hazel&#x27;s leg with his beak, reports of the many does at the overcrowded Efrafa warren. Captain Holly describes it as a dangerous totalitarian state, but Hazel feels they must go there. Bigwig infiltrates the warren and is made an Owsla officer by their cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Blackavar and Hyzenthlay. With Kehaar&#x27;s help, the escapees use a boat to float down the river. That night, Kehaar leaves for his homeland, but promises to return in winter.

Efrafan trackers eventually find Watership Down. Woundwort rejects Hazel&#x27;s offer of peace, and demands that all deserters must be turned over or Watership Down will be wiped out. While the Watership rabbits barricade their warren, Fiver slips into a trance, in which he envisions a dog named Bob running loose in the woods. His mumblings give Hazel an idea; he chews through the Nuthanger Farm watchdog&#x27;s leash, and Blackberry, Dandelion, and Hyzenthlay bait the dog into following them to the warren. Meanwhile, when the Efrafans break through the warren&#x27;s defences, Woundwort goes in alone; Blackavar attacks him but is easily killed. Bigwig ambushes Woundwort and they fight to a standstill. When Bob arrives and starts attacking the Efrafans, Woundwort abandons Bigwig and emerges from the warren, refuses to flee and he stands his ground until Bob notices him, and Woundwort fearlessly attacks Bob. However, no trace of Woundwort is ever found, which leaves his fate a mystery.

Several years later, an elderly Hazel is visited by the Black Rabbit, who invites him to join his own Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down&#x27;s perpetual safety. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies peacefully. His spirit follows the visitor through the woodland and trees towards the Sun, which metamorphoses into Frith, and the afterlife, as Frith&#x27;s parting advice to El-Ahrairah is heard once more.

==Production==
Film rights were purchased by producer Martin Rosen. He did this with the assistance of a merchant banker, Jake Eberts, who enjoyed the experience so much it launched Eberts&#x27;s career in the film industry. The option for the film rights was £50,000.

Rosen estimated the budget at $2.4 million. Eberts raised $1 million from the Pearson company and clients of the merchant bank Lazard.

Production of the film began in 1975 by a new animation studio, formed in London by Rosen. It was originally going to be directed by John Hubley, who left after disagreements with the film&#x27;s producer Martin Rosen. His work can still be found in the film, most notably in the &quot;fable&quot; scene. He was replaced by Rosen who thereby made his directorial debut.

The backgrounds and locations, especially Efrafa and the nearby railway, are based on the diagrams and maps in Richard Adams&#x27;s original novel. Most of the locations in the movie either exist or were based on real spots in Hampshire and surrounding areas.

===Music===
The musical score was by Angela Morley and Malcolm Williamson, Morley replacing Williamson after the composer had fallen behind and only composed the prelude and main title theme in sketch form. A list of the musical cues for the film can be found on the composer&#x27;s website, which also gives information about the different composers working on the project.

The soundtrack includes Art Garfunkel&#x27;s British No. 1 hit, &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, which was written by the British singer and songwriter Mike Batt. He also wrote other songs for the film which were not used. The composer recorded three songs with vocals by Garfunkel, but only &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; made it to the film. The song &quot;When You&#x27;re Losing Your Way in the Rain&quot; has a very similar feeling and arrangement, and was recorded by the former Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone in 1979. Garfunkel&#x27;s version was heard years later, on the &quot;Watership Down&quot; TV series soundtrack released in 2000. The song, like many others which appeared on the TV soundtrack, was never used in the show.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Watership Down&quot; was first released to the UK on 19 October 1978, and was later released in the United States on 1 November 1978, where the movie was distributed by AVCO Embassy Pictures. In British cinemas the film was preceded by the 1974 live-action short film &quot;Tahere Tikitiki: The Making of a Māori Canoe&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was very successful at the box office. According to financier Jake Eberts, the investors who put up the $50,000 development finance &quot;got their money back with interest, plus an additional $450,000, making a total of ten times their investment&quot;. Other investors in the film reportedly received a return of 5,000% on their investment.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1979.

===Reception and legacy===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 81% approval rating based on 37 reviews. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;Aimed at adults perhaps more than children, this is a respectful, beautifully animated adaptation of Richard Adams&#x27; beloved book.&quot; Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were divided on their opinions of &quot;Watership Down&quot; on their show &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. Siskel thought that the film was too long, but that otherwise he found &quot;most of it very effective&quot; due to the film&#x27;s success at situating the audience in the rabbits&#x27; point of view which put him &quot;in touch with the delicate and brutal balance of nature&quot;. He also called the film &quot;more mature than what we usually expect or get from an animated feature film&quot;. However, Ebert felt that the realism of the story, which he liked, did not match with the style of animation which he described as &quot;soft-edged, cuddly and like a cartoon&#x27;.

Some critics commented on the film&#x27;s success as an adaptation, such as &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Philip French, who wrote that &quot;the novel&#x27;s texture isn&#x27;t there and the characters never take on strong pictorial identities&quot;. Later in the review he elaborated that the rabbit characters are &quot;blandly drawn&quot; and concluded that the film as a whole is &quot;difficult to enthuse over&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, David Robinson also criticised the film&#x27;s translation to the screen as inaccessible for &quot;People who come to the film without the assistance of the book&quot;, as they &quot;may well have a little difficulty with the special lore and language of Richard Adams&#x27; rabbit civilisation&quot; and with the fictional Lapine language spoken by the rabbits. Robinson nevertheless complimented the voice acting and the &quot;fresh and pleasant&quot; animation design. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s Jay Scott, on the other hand, described the animation backgrounds of the film as &quot;second-rate shopping mall watercolor landscapes&quot; but praised the film&#x27;s allegorical aspects (drawing comparisons between the villain General Woundwort and Adolf Hitler), the realistic and compassionate approach to its rabbit characters, and the voice cast.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s Margaret Hinxman also praised the voice acting, the &quot;delicious&quot; music, and called the background landscapes &quot;superb&quot;, but concluded that &quot;Watership Down is by no stretch of the imagination a Disney-type animation feature film. Sadly, I have to say, if it had been I might have enjoyed it more.&quot; However, other critics drew favourable comparisons with Disney, notably Julian Fox in &quot;Films and Filming&quot;, who called &quot;Watership Down&quot; &quot;far and away the most exciting and totally involving animated feature since Disney&#x27;s peak years (&quot;ie&quot; that period which ended with &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot;).&quot; He praised in particular the aesthetics, sound design, and the film&#x27;s way of humanising the rabbit characters without over-anthropomorphising them. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Derek Malcolm also complimented Kehaar the seagull&#x27;s &quot;most Disney-like&quot; animation style even though he found the film as a whole to be &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and the song &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; to be &quot;more than a trifle bland&quot;.

In a joint review of &quot;Watership Down&quot; and Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, animation historian Michael Barrier described both films as &quot;very stupid movies, of a special kind&quot; and that &quot;the films themselves show no sign that any intelligence was at work in making them&quot; due to their &quot;grim literalism&quot; in adapting their source texts. He did describe &quot;Watership Down&quot; as the &quot;least offensive&quot; of the two but nevertheless characterised the animation style as &quot;graceless&quot; and expressed disappointment that the vision of the film&#x27;s original director John Hubley was never fully realised. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen also drew comparisons with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but while he disliked Bakshi&#x27;s film he was more effusive about &quot;Watership Down&quot;, which he said &quot;has the relentless momentum of a good war movie&quot; and &quot;is swift of foot, graced with wit, and capable of touching the hearts of both children and adults&quot;.

In a review of the DVD edition, &quot;Film Freak Central&quot;″s Walter Chaw praised the film for offering an &quot;unusually thoughtful&quot; alternative to Disney animated films of the era: &quot;&quot;Watership Down&quot; arose in that extended lull between Disney&#x27;s heyday and its late-Eighties resurrection. ... &quot;Watership Down&quot; points to the dwindled potential for American animation to evolve into what anime has become: a mature medium for artistic expression of serious issues.&quot; Chaw commended the film&#x27;s frankness, honesty, and themes of friendship and loyalty, concluding that, in spite of the film&#x27;s violent elements, &quot;the picture may be &quot;more&quot; appropriate for young children than a legion of condescendingly sugarcoated Disney fare.&quot;

===Effects on children and BBFC classification===
&quot;Watership Down&quot; has developed a reputation as a distressing children&#x27;s text, with Ed Power of &quot;The Independent&quot; describing the film in a 40th anniversary retrospective as a &quot;classic&quot; but which &quot;arguably traumatised an entire generation&quot;. In 2016, British broadcaster Channel 5 faced criticism after broadcasting the film in a pre-watershed slot on Easter Sunday, which was seen to be in poor taste due to the film&#x27;s representations of violence inflicted upon rabbits, and with many on social media expressing concern about child viewers being distressed (though it is unclear whether any children were actually negatively affected). Despite the criticism, Channel 5 broadcast &quot;Watership Down&quot; on Easter Sunday again the following year.

Despite the film&#x27;s reputation as traumatising, initial regulators and critics expressed little concern about the potentially negative effects on children. When first submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), it passed with a U (universal, suitable for all) classification, deciding that &quot;Animation removes the realistic gory horror in the occasional scenes of violence and bloodshed, and we felt that, while the film may move children emotionally during the film&#x27;s duration, it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken, and that a &#x27;U&#x27; certificate was therefore quite appropriate.&quot; This choice has proven controversial, and in 2012, the BBFC acknowledged that it had &quot;received complaints about the suitability of &quot;Watership Down&quot; at &#x27;U&#x27; almost every year since its classification&quot;. In August 2022, the BBFC raised the classification to PG for &quot;mild violence, threat, brief bloody images, language&quot;.

Like the BBFC, critics during initial release characterised &quot;Watership Down&quot; as suitable for children in spite of its potentially distressing aspects. &quot;The Spectator&quot;″s Ted Whitehead described it as &quot;a straightforward children&#x27;s adventure story&quot;. Scott in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;Parents are more apt to feel squeamish about this than their children: there is nothing as devastating as the death of Bambi&#x27;s mother. In &quot;Watership Down&quot;, some of the rabbits are unlucky and some live to old age. When they do die, the deaths are treated with sympathy but not morbidity. The message is that life is hard, and difficult, but that it&#x27;s fun, and rewarding, too.&quot; Malcolm in &quot;The Guardian&quot; dismissed concerns about the film&#x27;s suitability for children by stating that &quot;It is not true, as had already been hinted at by some, that the film is too violent and disturbing for children. What, pray, about some of Grimms&#x27; fairy tales?&quot; Fox in &quot;Films and Filming&quot; was one of the few critics to express caution by saying that, because of the &quot;graphic horror&quot;, &quot;one could scarcely recommend the film to the &quot;very&quot; young&quot;.

More recently, critics and scholars have defended &quot;Watership Down&quot;″s potential value for child audiences. Children&#x27;s media scholar Catherine Lester argues that the violence is &quot;never without a specific narrative or moral purpose&quot; and that discussions of the film&#x27;s effect upon children require &quot;greater nuance&quot; that acknowledges the complexity and variety of children as viewers and how they respond to films. Gerard Jones, in his essay for The Criterion Collection, admits that the film &quot;has troubled me ever since I first saw it&quot; at the age of twenty-one, but that he believes it is an important film for viewers of all ages because it &quot;asks us to spend time with those elements of existence that we will always find most troubling (and haunting and moving), and that we so rarely allow our children&#x27;s culture or our own entertainment to dwell on.&quot; He cites as an example the non-violent death of Hazel from old age at the end of the film, which he calls &quot;as joyous as it is poignant&quot;.

==Media==
===Picture book===
A picture book adaptation was also produced, titled &quot;The Watership Down Film Picture Book&quot;. Two editions of the book were published, one a hardcover, the other a reinforced cloth-bound edition. The contents include film stills linked with a combination of narration and extracts from the script, as well as a preface by Adams and a foreword by Rosen.

===Home media releases===
&quot;Watership Down&quot; was initially released on VHS in the UK by Thorn EMI Video, then later by Guild Home Video and later by PolyGram Video. It was given a DVD release in 2001 by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and another in 2005 from Warner Home Video.

In the US, &quot;Watership Down&quot; was first released on CED in 1981 by RCA SelectaVision VideoDiscs and was given a VHS and Betamax release in 1983 by Warner Home Video. The film was re-released a number of times on VHS in the US by Warner Home Video, including through their Warner Bros. Classic Tales label, and was released on DVD in the US in 2002 and again in 2008. The 2002 DVD release was later duplicated for Warner Bros&#x27; 2005 DVD release in the UK, with the only difference being the film being converted to PAL format.

A UK Blu-ray for the film was planned to be released in 2010 but, due to a rights dispute between Euro-London Films, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros., the release was cancelled. Warner eventually put out a BD release in Germany, where it held distribution rights. The UK Blu-ray was eventually released in 2013 by Universal using the same HD master as on Warner&#x27;s 2008 DVD and 2011 German Blu-ray release. In 2014, Euro-London Films acquired the remaining US rights from Warner Bros. (who had held US distribution rights since the 1980s) and licensed the film to The Criterion Collection for release on DVD, Blu-ray and streaming in 2015 and Janus Films for theatrical repertory runs.

The British Film Institute planned to release the film as a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in the UK in February 2023, but cancelled the release due to external issues beyond their control. In July 2024, however, the company announced a release date of 11 November 2024. A trailer for the 4K restoration was released on 11 September 2024. The restored film premiered at the 2024 BFI London Film Festival on 12 October 2024, and was released in UK and Irish cinemas on 25 October.

<text>Environmental archaeology is a sub-field of archaeology which emerged in 1970s and is the science of reconstructing the relationships between past societies and the environments they lived in. The field represents an archaeological-palaeoecological approach to studying the palaeoenvironment through the methods of human palaeoecology and other geosciences. Reconstructing past environments and past peoples&#x27; relationships and interactions with the landscapes they inhabited provide archaeologists with insights into the origins and evolution of anthropogenic environments and human systems. This includes subjects such as including prehistoric lifestyle adaptations to change and economic practices.

Environmental archaeology is commonly divided into three sub-fields:
* archaeobotany (the study of plant remains)
* zooarchaeology (the study of faunal remains)
* geoarchaeology (the study of geological processes and their relationship to the archaeological record)

Environmental archaeology often involves studying plant and animal remains in order to investigate which plant and animal species were present at the time of prehistoric habitations, and how past societies managed them. It may also involve studying the physical environment and how similar or different it was in the past compared to the present day. An important component of such analyses represents the study of site formation processes. 

This field is particularly useful when artifacts may be absent from an excavated or surveyed site, or in cases of earth movement, such as erosion, which may have buried artifacts and archaeological features. While specialist sub-fields, for example bioarchaeology or geomorphology, are defined by the materials they study, the term &quot;environmental&quot; is used as a general template in order to denote a general field of scientific inquiry that is applicable across time periods and geographical regions studied by archaeology as a whole.

== Subfields ==

=== Archaeobotany ===

Archaeobotany is the study and interpretation of plant remains. By determining the uses of plants in historical contexts, researchers can reconstruct the diets of past humans, as well as determine their Subsistence economy strategies and plant economy. This provides greater insight into a people&#x27;s social and cultural behaviors. Analysis of specimen like wood charcoal, for example, can reveal the source of fuel or construction for a society. Archaeobotanists also often study seed and fruit remains, along with pollen and starch. Plants can be preserved in a variety of ways, but the most common are carbonization, water logging, mineralization, and desiccation. A field within archaeobotany is ethnobotany, which looks more specifically at the relationship between plants and humans, and the cultural impacts plants have had and continue to have on human societies. Plant usage as food and as crops or as medicine is of interest, as well the plants&#x27; economic influences.

=== Zooarchaeology ===
Zooarchaeology is the study of animal remains and what these remains can tell us about the human societies the animals existed among. Animal remains can provide evidence of predation by humans (or vice versa) or domestication. Despite revealing the specific relationships between animals and humans, discovery of animal bones, hides, or DNA in a certain area can describe the location&#x27;s past landscape or climate.

=== Geoarchaeology ===
Geoarchaeology is the study of landscape and of geological processes. It looks at environments within the human timeline to determine how past societies may have influenced or been influenced by the environment. Sediment and soil are often studied because this is where the majority of artifacts are found, but also because natural processes and human behavior can alter the soil and reveal its history. Apart from visual observation, computer programming and satellite imaging are often employed to reconstruct past landscapes or architecture.

===Other related fields===
Due to the multidisciplinary nature of archaeology in general, the range of research in the earth and environmental sciences, and possibility of methodologies, environmental archaeology has branched and connected with a number of other fields to include numerous cross and subfields such as:
* 
* 
* archaeoentomology
* 
* 
* bioarchaeology and human ecology
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Quaternary research
* as well as fields related to various chronological dating techniques; including radiocarbon dating, luminescence dating, and archaeomagnetic dating.

== History ==

Environmental archaeology has emerged as a distinct discipline since the second half of the 20th century. In recent years it has grown rapidly in significance and is now an established component of most excavation projects. The field is multidisciplinary, and environmental archaeologists, as well as palaeoecologists, work side by side with archaeologists and anthropologists specialising in material culture studies in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of past human livelihood and people-environment interactions, especially how climatic stress affected humans and forced them to adapt.

In archaeology in the 1960s, the environment was seen as having a &quot;passive&quot; interaction with humans. With the inclusion of Darwinism and ecological principles, however, this paradigm began to shift. Prominent theories and principles of the time (oasis theory, catastrophism, and &quot;longue duree&quot;) emphasized this philosophy. Catastrophism, for instance, discussed how catastrophes like natural disaster could be the determining factor in a society&#x27;s survival. The environment could have social, political, and economic impacts on human communities. It became more important for researchers to look at the direct influence the environment could have on a society. This gave rise to middle range theory and the major questions asked by environmental archaeology in the 20th and 21st centuries. Research has since led environmental archaeology to two major conclusions: humanity originated in Africa and agriculture originated in south-west Asia. Another important shift in thinking within the field centered around the notion of cost-effectivity. Before, archaeologists thought that humans usually acted to maximize their use of resources, but have since come to believe that this is not the case. Subsequent theories/principles include sociality and agency, and the focus on relationships between archaeological sites. Government research audits and the &#x27;commercialisation&#x27; of environmental archaeology have also shaped the sub-discipline in more recent times.

== Methods ==
Environmental archaeologists approach a site through evaluation and/or excavation. Evaluation seeks to analyze the resources and artifacts given in an area and their potential significance. Excavation takes samples from different layers in the ground and uses a similar strategy to evaluation. The samples typically sought after are human and faunal remains, pollen and spores, wood and charcoal, insects, and even isotopes. Biomolecules like lipids, proteins, and DNA can be revelatory samples. With respect to geoarchaeology, computer systems for topography and satellites imaging are often used to reconstruct landscapes. The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system that can process spatial data and construct virtual landscapes. Climate records are able to be reconstructed through paleoclimatology proxies, which can provide information on temperatures, precipitation, vegetation, and other climate-dependent conditions. These proxies can be used to provide context for present climate and compare past climate against the present.

== Significance ==

Each focus within environmental archaeology collects information about a different aspect of humans&#x27; relation with their surrounding environment. Together these components (along with methods from other fields) are combined to fully understand a past society&#x27;s lifestyle and interactions with their environment. Past aspects of land use, food production, tool use, and occupation patterns can all be established and the knowledge applied to current and future human-environment interactions. Through predation, agriculture, and introduction of foreign biota into new environments, humans have altered past environments. Understanding these past processes can help us pursue conservation and restorative processes in the present.

Environmental archaeology provides insight on sustainability and why some cultures collapsed while others survived. Societal collapse has occurred many times throughout history, one of the most prominent examples being the Maya civilization. Using lake sediment core and climate reconstruction technology discussed earlier, archaeologists were able to reconstruct the climate present at the time of the Mayans. Although the Yucatán Peninsula was found to have extreme drought at the time Mayan society collapsed, many other factors contributed to their demise. Deforestation, overpopulation, and manipulating wetlands are only a few theories as to why the Maya civilization collapsed, but all of these worked in tandem to negatively impact the environment. From a sustainability perspective, studying how the Mayans impacted the environment allows researchers to see how these changes have permanently affected the landscape and subsequent populations living in the area.

Archaeologists are increasingly under pressure to demonstrate that their work has impact beyond the discipline. This has prompted environmental archaeologists to argue that an understanding of past environmental changes is essential to model future outcomes in areas such as climate change, land cover change, soil health and food security.

* John Birks, a botanist and emeritus professor at the University of Bergen and University College London, is renowned for his novel quantitative techniques in Quaternary palaeoecology. His extensive research focuses on the vegetational and environmental history of the past 10-20,000 years across various regions, including Fennoscandia, the United Kingdom, Minnesota, the Yukon, Siberia, and Tibet.
* Don Brothwell (1933–2016), was a distinguished British archaeologist and anthropologist, who specialised in human palaeoecology and environmental archaeology. His career spanned several prominent institutions including the University of Cambridge, the British Museum, and the University of London, the University of York. Brothwell was celebrated as a pioneer in archaeological science, contributing extensively to the study of human and animal remains, and founding the Journal of Archaeological Science.
* Karl Butzer is a notable pioneer of environmental archaeology and has won numerous awards and conducted research in the fields of archaeology, geography, and geology.
* Eric Higgs researched the development of agriculture in Asia and the method of &quot;site catchment analysis&quot;, which looks at the exploitation of land based on the land&#x27;s potential.
* Douglas Kennett is a controversial environmental archaeologist and human behavioral ecologist known for his work investigating how climate change affected Maya civilization in its development and disintegration. and for his contributions as a member of the Comet Research Group to the controversial and disputed Younger Dryas impact hypothesis which asserts that the Clovis culture was destroyed by a shower of comets. His most widely disseminated paper was a collaboration with biblical archaeologists who believe they have discovered the ancient city of Sodom at Tell el-Hammam, Jordon, and that it was destroyed by a comet. On February 15, 2023, the following editor’s note was posted on this paper, &quot;Readers are alerted that concerns raised about the data presented and the conclusions of this article are being considered by the Editors. A further editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.&quot;
* Louis Leakey contributed to a vast amount of research in this field. Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey are most known for their work on human origins in Africa. Lewis Binford developed the middle range theory. Under this theory, researchers study the relationship between humans and the environment, which can be depicted in models.
* Cathy Whitlock, an Earth Scientist and Professor at Montana State University, specializing in Quaternary environmental change and palaeoclimatology. She is most known for her research on &quot;palaeofire,&quot; which uses sediment cores to reconstruct historical vegetation, fire, and climate patterns (particularly post-Yellowstone fires). Whitlock has significantly contributed to academic understandings of climate dynamics and encouraging informed conservation efforts and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2018.
* Janet Wilmshurst, a New Zealand-based palaeoecologist who has researched fossil records to examine relationships between human settlements and natural disturbances, including novel methods of carbon-dated rat-gnawed seeds to trace Polynesian settlements over time.

<text>&quot;Bart to the Future&quot; is the seventeenth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2000. In the episode, Bart is shown a vision of his future as a wannabe rock musician living with Ralph Wiggum, while Lisa has become the President of the United States and tries to get the country out of financial trouble. &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; was the second episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to be set in the future, following &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding.&quot;

The episode was directed by Michael Marcantel and written by Dan Greaney, who wanted to explore what Bart&#x27;s life would end up like. Several designs were made by the animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on how he wanted him to look.

Reception of &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; by critics has been generally mixed. Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, because of a reference to the presidency of Donald Trump.

==Plot==
The Simpsons drive to the park for a picnic but discover that it has been overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds a Native American casino. Bart is turned away because he is 10 years old but is able to sneak in by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall&#x27;s dummy case. During Crandall&#x27;s performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager&#x27;s office, where the Native American manager shows him a vision of how his future will turn out if he does not change his ways.

Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of DeVry Institute. He lives with his bandmate Ralph Wiggum in a beach cottage by the shore, where they are struggling to make ends meet and have resorted to mooching off Bart&#x27;s parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart and Ralph can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, they are only paid in popcorn shrimp. The morning after their disastrous concert at Nelson&#x27;s bar, Bart and Ralph find out that they have been evicted from their house.

Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa becomes &quot;the first straight female President of the United States&quot;, and moves into the White House, to where Bart quickly moves in and invites their parents to live in, and his antics prove a burden on Lisa&#x27;s political activities, much to Lisa&#x27;s discomfort. Homer uses the time to search for gold buried by Abraham Lincoln on the grounds of the White House. When he finally locates the &quot;gold&quot;, it is in fact a chest with a scroll in it that Lincoln had written on explaining that his &quot;gold&quot; is &quot;in the heart of every freedom-loving American.&quot; Homer does not appreciate the metaphor and angrily curses Lincoln; when present-day Bart asks the manager about this subplot, he claims that he needed filler after the main vision became &quot;too thin&quot;.

Bart disrupts one of Lisa&#x27;s addresses to the nation to promote his music career, which leads Lisa to be branded unpopular when Bart sings to the public on live television that Lisa will be imposing a tax rise to get the country out of debt; the leaders of America&#x27;s creditor nations then demand that America pay them back. Frustrated with his antics, Lisa distracts Bart by making him &quot;Secretary of Keeping it Real.&quot; His conscience manifests in the form of Billy Carter&#x27;s ghost, who reminds him that he is an embarrassment because of his actions and suggests he atone for his mistakes (although he does endorse the casino within the vision).

Bart steps in at Lisa&#x27;s meeting with the leaders and uses his skills at stalling debt collectors to save the day, promising the money will soon be repaid in full, pleasing Lisa. As a thank-you, Lisa promises Bart to &quot;legalize it.&quot; After the vision is over, Bart promises that he will change; the manager then disappears. Lisa finds Bart and tells him that the family has been kicked out of the casino after Homer pushed a waitress and Marge lost $20,000. Bart tells Lisa about his vision of the future where he has a rock band and a moped, while downplaying Lisa&#x27;s future presidency as &quot;some government job&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Bart to the Future&quot; was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Michael Marcantel as part of the eleventh season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1999–2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family&#x27;s life in the future, following the season six episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;: &quot;Future-Drama&quot; (season 16, 2005), &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; (season 23, 2011) and &quot;Days of Future Future&quot; (season 25, 2014). Greaney&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; came from &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. He and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer Matt Selman were sitting in Greaney&#x27;s office one day, trying to come up with new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode. Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought it would be interesting to explore how the future works out for &quot;a guy like Bart, who doesn&#x27;t pay attention to school work and is all about being cool.&quot;

Selman commented in an audio commentary for &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; that &quot;the thing that really got the [&quot;Simpsons&quot;] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart.&quot; Greaney identified this version as &quot;the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else that they used to be cool, that it&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s fault that his life hasn&#x27;t gone the way he wants it to go.&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is the kind of person who is &quot;always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he&#x27;s owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that&#x27;s gonna come sooner or later.&quot; Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.
According to Greaney, the animators originally designed future Bart as &quot;cool and fun&quot; and made several designs where he was &quot;slim, attractive, and hip.&quot; Greaney did not think any of these designs went along with the personality he and the other writers had assigned to future Bart, so he told the animators to draw the character with belly fat, a ponytail, sags under his eyes, and one earring. Scully said on the audio commentary that he thought the design of Bart looked &quot;great&quot;, though he added that it was &quot;slightly disturbing&quot; to see the older versions of Homer and Marge in the episode, and joked that it is &quot;a little bit sad to watch cartoon characters age.&quot;

Greaney needed a setpiece for the episode that enabled him to get into a vision of the characters in the future, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer George Meyer came up with the idea of the Indian casino. When Homer and Bart first enter the casino, Homer tells Bart that &quot;Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.&quot; He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying &quot;Hi-how-are-you?&quot; in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) &quot;did [the joke] so funny when we were at the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending.&quot;

==Release and reception==
The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 8.77 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 8.7, the episode finished 28th in the ratings for the week of March 13–19, 2000. It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (which received a 10.0 rating and was watched in 10.1 million homes).

On October 7, 2008, &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; was released on DVD as part of the box set &quot;The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season&quot;. Staff members Mike Scully, Dan Greaney, Matt Selman, and George Meyer participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.

&quot;Bart to the Future&quot; has received mixed reviews from critics compared to &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which was met with positive response. Nancy Basile of About.com listed it as one of the episodes she felt &quot;shined in season eleven&quot;. While reviewing the eleventh season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson commented on &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;, writing: &quot;This kind of fantasy episode can be hit or miss, and that trend holds true here. However, more of &#x27;Future&#x27; succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove pretty good. At no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time.&quot;

Hayden Childs of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote in 2011 that the episode &quot;was not so good, although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of &#x27;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding. In 2003, Ben Rayner of &quot;Toronto Star&quot; referred to &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; as &quot;a lame 2000 outing&quot; and noted that &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;rightly dubbed [it] the &#x27;worst episode ever. &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; columnist Randall King wrote in his review of season eleven that the episode &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot; (which features the death of the character Maude Flanders) was &quot;proof that the dependably brilliant series could – and did – go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin compounded by the Bart to the Future episode [...]&quot;.

In his 2006 book &quot;Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality&quot;, Jonathan Gray analyzed the many advertisement parodies featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He commented on &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;, writing: &quot;As if ads in children&#x27;s toys or in churches are not enough, in &#x27;Bart to the Future&#x27;, an episode in which an Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, &#x27;I guess I am an embarrassment&#x27;, and a ghost responds, &#x27;You sure are. But, hey, there&#x27;s an embarrassment &quot;of riches&quot; at the Caesar&#x27;s Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!&#x27; Here [...] &quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric.&quot;

==Donald Trump presidency==

The episode heavily implies that real estate mogul Donald Trump became president, and caused a budget crisis that Lisa inherits. In 2015, news media cited the episode as a foreshadowing of Trump&#x27;s future run for president; the episode was produced during Trump&#x27;s 2000 third-party run. Dan Greaney told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in a 2016 interview that the thought of a Trump presidency at the time &quot;just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.&quot; In an interview with &quot;TMZ&quot; in May 2016, Matt Groening said he thought it was unlikely that Donald Trump would become the president of the United States.

On November 8, 2016, Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Four days later, in the opening credits of the episode &quot;Havana Wild Weekend&quot;, aired on November 13, 2016, Bart writes &quot;Being right sucks&quot; as the chalkboard gag. Scenes from a 2015 &quot;Simpsons&quot; YouTube post &quot;Trumptastic Voyage&quot; (which references real-life scenes of Donald Trump around that time) have been mistakenly identified as those from &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;. The episode attracted further attention in 2021 after the inauguration of Joe Biden when the dress Vice President Kamala Harris wore for the event was compared to Lisa&#x27;s outfit in the episode. During the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris was nominated by the Democratic Party following President Biden&#x27;s withdrawal from the election. Harris would ultimately lose the election to Trump, which in turn prompted further attention to the episode.

<doc id="982257" wikidata="Q1375710" url="?curid=982257" title="Challenge International de Tourisme 1930">
<text>The International Touring Competition in 1930 () was the second FAI international touring aircraft contest, that took place between July 18 and August 8, 1930 in Berlin, Germany. Four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe.
==Overview==
Germany organized the contest, because the German pilot Fritz Morzik won the previous contest in 1929. The regulation based upon the FAI rules, but details were worked out by the German Aero Club. The international Sports Committee was headed by the German Gerd von Hoeppner. 98 crews applied, but eventually 60 aircraft entered the Challenge in 1930, from six countries: Germany (30 crews), Poland (12 crews), United Kingdom (7 crews), France (6 crews), Spain (3 crews) and the Swiss (2 crews). In the British team there was one Canadian, and in the French team – one Belgian. It was the first major international event in which the Polish aviation took part, with second most numerous team in addition, equipped with own design aircraft. This time, Italy nor Czechoslovakia did not participate.

In the German team there was first of all Fritz Morzik – a winner of the Challenge 1929. Among the British team, there were pilots: Captain Hubert Broad (2nd place in 1929), the Canadian John Carberry (3rd place in 1929) and two women: Winifred Spooner and Lady Mary Bailey. In the Spanish team, there was prince Antonio de Habsburgo-Borbón. Many other known aviators of that time took part in the contest as well.

The contest was open on July 18, 1930, at Berlin-Staaken airfield. It consisted of two parts: a circuit over Europe and technical trials. Since one of the aims of the Challenge was to generate a progress in aircraft designing, it was not only pilots&#x27; competition, but technical trials also included a construction evaluation, to build more advanced and reliable touring planes. All planes flew with two-men crews, pilot and passenger or mechanic (apart from the Swiss Charles Kolp, who took two passengers, including one woman, into his Klemm VL.25).

==Aircraft==

Most of the aircraft in the contest were popular sport planes of the late 1920s, that took part in the previous contest as well, like de Havilland Gipsy Moth DH-60G, which was the main aircraft of the British and Spanish teams. These aircraft had mostly open cabs, and were built in mostly low-wing (29) or high-wing (17) layout, only 13 were biplanes (and 1 mid-wing). Only five were of all-metal construction, most were all-wooden. On contrary to a previous contest, there appeared also some special aircraft, better suited to meet the Challenge demands. First of all, they were German BFW M.23c and Klemm L 25E, being new variants of successful machines of 1929 – wooden low-wing monoplanes with closed canopy, belonging to lighter category, yet fitted with powerful Argus engines, having better chance in technical trials. All aircraft in the contest had fixed conventional landing gear and had no wing mechanization (slats or flaps) yet.

Aircraft participating were BFW M.23c (10), BFW M.23b (1), Klemm L.25 (4), Klemm L.25E (3), Klemm L 26 (2), Klemm VL 25 (1), Junkers A50 (3), Arado L II (4), Albatros L 100 (1), Albatros L 101 (1), Darmstadt D-18 (1), de Havilland DH.60G Gipsy Moth (6), Avro Avian (1), Spartan Arrow (1), Monocoupe 110 (1), RWD-2 (3), RWD-4 (3), PZL.5 (2), PWS-50 (1), PWS-51 (1), PWS-52 (1), PWS-8 (1), Caudron C.193 (3), Caudron C.232 (1), Peyret-Mauboussin PM XI (1), Saint Hubert G1 (1), Breda Ba.15S (1), CASA C-1 (1).

20 aircraft were assigned to the Class II with net weight up to 322 kg (300 kg plus 15%), the remaining 40 to the Class I with net weight up to 460 kg (400 kg plus 15%). Class II aircraft were 11 German BFW M.23s and 5 Klemm L.25s and L.25E&#x27;s (apart from two L.25 IVa), 3 Polish RWD-2s and one French PM XI. The classes had influence on awarding points for cruise speed and fuel consumption only.

The aircraft had alphanumerical starting numbers, the German from a range: A2-A9, B3-B9, C1-C9, D1-D8, E1-E9, F1-F2, British: K1-K8, French: L1-L3, M1-M6, Polish: O1-O9, P1-P5, Swiss: S1-S2, Spanish: T1-T7 (numbers were painted in a circle, with inscription: &quot;Challenge International&quot; and &quot;1930&quot;).

==Circuit over Europe==

The contest in 1930 was the only &quot;Challenge&quot;, in which a rally was the opening phase. It was a 7560 km circuit over Europe, with compulsory stops at: Berlin – Braunschweig – Frankfurt – Reims – Saint-Inglevert – Bristol – London – Saint-Inglevert – Paris – Poitiers – Pau – Zaragoza – Madrid – Seville – Zaragoza – Barcelona – Nimes – Lyon – Lausanne – Bern – Munich – Vienna – Prague – Breslau (Wrocław) – Poznań – Warsaw – Königsberg (Kaliningrad) – Danzig (Gdańsk) – Berlin. Distances ranged from 77.5 km (Lausanne – Bern) to 410 km (Danzig – Berlin). In spite of attempts of many pilots at being the first man home, it was not a race, but rather a reliability test. A regularity of flights was the most important factor, the second was a cruise speed (minimal cruise speed had to be 80 km/h for Class I aircraft or 60 km/h for lighter Class II aircraft. Cruise speeds above 175/155 km/h respectively did not give extra points). The average speed was judged on flying time, so a competitor had to have his log book signed as soon after landing as possible. A competitor was given 75 points for regularity, which were mulcted for spending nights off the control airfield or not covering any stage in a day. One night outside the control or arrival after the official closing time (8 p.m.) costed 15 points, two nights – 45 points, and three failures to reach the control caused a disqualification. Also, for failing to fly any stage in a day, a competitor would lose 10 points, and for the second time – another 20 points. The original time limit for the return to Berlin was 4 p.m. on July 31, but it got extended later for some crews, due to bad weather in Pau. Apart from 75 points for regularity, up to 195 points could be gained for a high cruise speed. Comparing with 1929 competition, the rally could bring only 54% of maximum number of points (in 1929 – 72%), what meant more stress on technical trials.
The crews took off between 9 and 9.59 AM on Sunday, July 20, from Berlin-Tempelhof. Despite poor weather, on the first day, fifteen crews reached Saint-Inglevert near Calais, 1058 km away (among them, 6 British crews, 4 French, 3 Polish and only 2 German). One Spanish and one Polish crew damaged aircraft (CASA C-1 and PWS-52) and had to withdraw, the other Pole from the fastest group Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-4) got ill from appendicitis. On July 21 the weather enabled flying only about mid-day, but then most crews flew over the English Channel, and the fastest 23 planes managed to return to France. Three British and three French crews reached Paris that day, flying 843,5 km. One French crew destroyed the plane during forced landing (PM XI), several other planes got damaged on that or the previous day, but could be repaired.

On July 22 – the third day of the rally, the fastest pilots reached Madrid, 3019 km from the start. They were five British crews: Hubert Broad, Alan Butler (both DH-60G), Sidney Thorn (Avro Avian), John Carberry (Monocoupe 110) and H. Andrews (receiving penalty points for landing after closure), three Germans (Fritz Morzik, Willy Polte – both BFW M.23c, Reinhold Poss – Klemm L.25E) and two Frenchmen (François Arrachart, Maurice Finat – both C.193s). Four more aircraft, including Prince de Habsburgo-Borbon and Georg Pasewaldt, managed to fly to Zaragoza over the Pyrenees, but the French crews of Cornez (C.193) and MacMahon (C.232) crashed their aircraft, while trying to fly farther. The rest was spread out on the whole track, the slowest pilots being only 800–1000 km away from Berlin. Five crews dropped out on that day – apart from the mentioned ones, also one German and Spanish crew damaged their aircraft during flight to Pau. Another German pilot von Oertzen withdrew, when his passenger von Redern was killed by a propeller of their Albatros L.100 in London.

Twelve fastest crews were the lucky ones to get to Spain, because on July 23 and 24, the whole rest of crews were grounded in Pau due to bad weather over the Pyrenees. Lady Bailey was the last to try to fly to Zaragoza, but she was forced to return to Pau. Due to flight prohibition, there were no penalties for not flying farther, and the return time limit was extended by 24 or 48 hours, depending on time when the crew arrived at Pau. Five crews reached Barcelona on the 23rd, and Lausanne on the next day. On July 25, the weather improved and the rest of crews was allowed to fly to Zaragoza. Meanwhile, 4 fastest pilots: Hubert Broad, Sidney Thorn, Alan Butler and Reinhold Poss, reached Breslau, and Fritz Morzik – Prague. Four crews dropped out that day, among them the best Polish pilot Franciszek Żwirko, flying RWD-4 (due to engine failure), also two German and the only Belgian crew of Jacques Maus (St. Hubert G.1).
On July 26, four crews reached Warsaw (Poss, Broad, Thorn and Prince de Habsburgo-Borbon). The fastest of crews, that had been halted by the weather, reached Bern (the Pole Jerzy Bajan and two Germans Aichele and Dinort), being 700 km behind last crews of the first group, resting in Viena. On that day two German crewmen Erich Offermann and E. Jerzembski (BFW M.23c) were killed in a crash landing in Lyon, hitting an aerial mast, while the other German crew of Rudolf Neininger (Darmstadt D-18) fell into the Gulf of Lyon, but were salvaged by a passing ship. 
On July 27 the first pilots finished in Berlin. The first came Hubert Broad, then Sidney Thorn followed closely by Reinhold Poss. In an hour, there flew also Fritz Morzik, Maurice Finat, prince Antonio de Habsburgo-Borbon, Georg Pasewaldt, H. Andrews and A.S. Butler. The fastest on the whole track was Alan Butler (DH-60G – average speed 179 km/h), but due to a propeller exchange in Poznań, he was disqualified and finished the rally off the contest. The fastest of qualified crews and the only one to gain full points, was Hubert Broad (176 km/h). On that day, 35 crews were still on the track. On July 28 seven crews reached Berlin (Willy Polte, Oskar Dinort, Winifred Spooner, Mary Bailey, John Carberry, François Arrachart, Stanisław Płonczyński), on July 29 – 9 more (among others, Theo Osterkamp, Jerzy Bajan, Johann Risztics, Robert Lusser, Oskar Notz), and the rest – on next days. The last crews finished the rally on August 1. Some crews dropped out or were disqualified in these last days as well.

The circuit over Europe appeared to be quite difficult for aircraft and pilots. Only 36 crews out of 60 finished in time. Further 6 crews completed the circuit in spite of being disqualified due to time infringement or propeller repairs, in case of not carrying a spare propeller. Among those, who dropped out, were 9 German crews (3 of them completed the circuit), 8 Polish (3 completed the circuit), 4 French, 2 Spanish and 1 British (completed the circuit). After the rally, a leader in the general classification was Hubert Broad (DH-60G, 270 points), behind him: John Carberry (Monocoupe, 268 pts), Reinhold Poss (Klemm L.25E, 264 pts), fourth was Fritz Morzik (BFW M.23c, 263 pts). The fastest German pilot was Dietrich von Massenbach (151 km/h), but he lost 10 points for regularity.

Top results of the rally:.

Note, that lighter aircraft, like Klemm L.25, BFW M.23, RWD-2 (below 322 kg empty weight), were in the Category II, with lower cruise speed demands.

==Technical trials==
The first was a trial of quick wings&#x27; folding, which was a feature to save place in hangars. The quickest were the crews flying DH-60s (Hubert Broad&#x27;s crew folded and unfolded wings in mere 48 sec), awarded with 19 points. Crews of the German BFW M.23c scored 17-18 pts, of the Klemm L.25E – 16-17 (F. Morzik – 18 pts, O. Notz and W. Polte – 17 pts, R. Poss – 16 pts).
John Carberry&#x27;s Monocoupe, the Polish RWD&#x27;s and the Avro Avian lost a number of points, not having folding or dismounting wings at all.

The next was quick engine starting test, in which equipping with a starter was extra awarded. The best Klemm L.25Ia of Theo Osterkamp, with Salmson AD.9 engine, earned 11 points. The British aircraft were handicapped by lack of starters, and the best crews – Miss Spooner and Lady Bailey, got 6 points, while H. Broad got 4 points. On the other hand, F. Morzik and R. Poss got only 7 points. On August 3 there was a fuel consumption trial on a 304 km distance. The best in fuel consumption were light RWD-2s, then German Klemms and BFWs, but 17 aircraft scored maximum of 30 pts and point differences between most of other aircraft were not big. The German Walter Spengler (Klemm L.25) was disqualified for not carrying his spare propeller aboard during this trial. Hubert Broad was still the leader, but F. Morzik was only one point behind.

On August 4 there took place a technical evaluation of competing planes&#x27; construction. Since it was a touring plane contest, such features, like comfortable cabs, side-by-side seats, rich set of controls, twin controls, safety devices (anti-fire devices and places for parachutes and water safety equipment) were also awarded. In a technical evaluation, a maximum of 104 points could be won, of a total of 230 points for technical part. Most important feature was a comfortable cab (up to 42 points). Most points was given to the American Monocoupe of John Carberry (74 pts), then to three German Junkers A50s (67-69 pts), then Breda Ba.15S and Arado L IIa (65 pts). 62 points were given to Klemm L.25E of Reinhold Poss, the same to Polish RWD-4 of Jerzy Bajan. DH-60G&#x27;s of Hubert Broad and Winifred Spooner were awarded only with 56 pts, while the BFW M.23c of Fritz Morzik with 54 pts. The worst was evaluation of Hans Böhning&#x27;s BFW M.23b, with 39 pts (a winning type of the previous Challenge), the second worst was Sidney Thorn&#x27;s Avro Avian – 43 pts.

Additionally, in a meantime, the sports commission evaluated possibilities of dismantling the aircraft for transport (the points were added to results of wings&#x27; folding and unfolding). The German crews, flying BFW M.23c, along with F. Morzik, received additional 6 points, and Klemms L.25E, along with Poss and Notz – 3 points. No points were given to the British, Polish or French aircraft.

After these trials, leaders in a classification became the Germans: Reinhold Poss (382 pts), Oskar Notz (380 pts), Fritz Morzik (378 pts), then John Carberry (377 pts), Hubert Broad (375 pts) and Winifred Spooner (370 pts). Last trials however brought some changes to this classification.

From evening August 5 until August 7 there were carried short take-off and landing trials. Short take-off trial demanded flying over an 8.5m-high gate, which consisted of two masts with a stretched tape. Each crew had two training attempts and two trials. The German pilot Ernst Krüger was the best, starting from the lowest distance of 125.5 m, then Fritz Morzik (126.4 m) – both flying the BFW M.23c, and awarded with 30 pts. Next places were occupied also by the Germans, the sixth was Winifred Spooner flying DH-60 (142 m – 25 pts). Hubert Broad was given only 12 points (198.4 m), and John Carberry – 21 points (153.7 m).

The last was a short landing trial, from above an 8.5m-high gate. The best result, 127.3 m (30 pts), was made by the German Theo Osterkamp, flying older model of Klemm L.25 Ia, then Friedrich Siebel (Klemm L.26, 25 pts). The third was Winifred Spooner (21 pts); Fritz Morzik and Reinhold Poss had the 5th and 6th result respectively. Again Hubert Broad&#x27;s result was only 8 points, and John Carberry&#x27;s – 7 points. In both last trials, the Polish and French aircraft performed poorly as well.

To sum up technical trials part: Hubert Broad&#x27;s advantage over other competitors was decreasing in following trials, then he lost several places after the aircraft evaluation and wings&#x27; folding tests. After poor take-off and landing results, he occupied the 8th position eventually. Due to lack of folding wings and engine starter, John Carberry fell from the 2nd to 11th position, only to regain this position thanks to best aircraft evaluation. However, mediocre take-off and landing results gave him the 6th place overall. Technical part saw a duel between Reinhold Poss and Fritz Morzik, occupying the 3rd and 4th places respectively after the circuit part. Poss took a lead, while Morzik fell to the 5th position after the aircraft evaluation, but Morzik&#x27;s superb take-off and landing made him a winner, while Poss took the 2nd place. Oskar Notz and Winifred Spooner both performed very well, improving their positions by three places (from the 7th and 8th place respectively), while Willy Polte improved it only by one step (from the 6th position). Winifred Spooner performed good take-off and landing as the only British competitor and the only flying DH.60. Other competitors, who managed to improve their positions much in this part, in spite of flying older aircraft, were Theo Osterkamp (from the 16th to 11th place), Robert Lusser (from the 18th to 14th place) and Friedrich Siebel (from 25th to 18th place). Among the competitors, who lost most position, were Edward Więckowski (from 15th to 21st place), S. Thorn and A. Gothe.

==Results==
After all trials, on August 8 there was a closing ceremony. The first three places were occupied by the Germans, flying specially developed variants of sports aircraft, the winner being Fritz Morzik again. On the fourth place was Miss Winifred Spooner, who managed to improve her position since the rally part, thanks to skills in technical trials, which were not favourable for the British aircraft.

Only 35 crews of 60 completed the contest, among them 20 German, 6 British, 4 Polish, 2 Swiss, 2 French, 1 Spanish:


The 1st place was awarded with 100,000 French francs, the 2nd place with 50,000 FRF, the 3rd place with 25,000 FRF, the 4th place with 15,000 FRF, from 5th to 20th place – with 10,000 FRF.

Due to the German victory, the next Challenge 1932 was organized in Germany as well. The next Challenge, due to regulations&#x27; changes, turned out to be more difficult contest. For 1932 contest, most countries developed advanced sport aircraft, with high technical performance.

<text>Anglican church music is music that is written for Christian worship in Anglican religious services, forming part of the liturgy. It mostly consists of pieces written to be sung by a church choir, which may sing &quot;a cappella&quot; or accompanied by an organ.

Anglican music forms an important part of traditional worship not only in the Church of England, but also in the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, the Church of Ireland, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Australia and other Christian denominations which identify as Anglican. It can also be used at the Personal Ordinariates of the Roman Catholic Church.

==Forms==
The chief musical forms in Anglican church music are centred around the forms of worship defined in the liturgy.

===Service settings===

Service settings are choral settings of the words of the liturgy. These include:

; The Ordinary of the Eucharist
: Sung Eucharist is a musical setting of the service of Holy Communion. Naming conventions may vary according to the churchmanship of the place of worship; in churches that tend towards a low church or broad church style of worship, the terms &quot;Eucharist&quot; or &quot;Communion&quot; are common, while in high church worship, the more Catholic term &quot;Mass&quot; may be used. Musical pieces corresponding to the liturgical pattern of the Ordinary of the Mass (&quot;Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus &amp; Benedictus, Agnus Dei&quot;) may be sung by the choir or congregation. Many English-language settings of the communion service have been written, such as those by Herbert Howells and Harold Darke; simpler settings suitable for al singing are also used, such as the services by John Merbecke or Martin Shaw. In high church worship, Latin Mass settings are often preferred, such as those by William Byrd.

; Morning Service
: The Anglican service of morning prayer, known as Mattins, is a peculiarly Anglican service which originated in 1552 as an amalgam of the monastic offices of Matins, Lauds and Prime in Thomas Cranmer’s Second Prayer Book of Edward VI. Choral settings of the Morning Service may include the opening preces and responses (see below), the &quot;Venite&quot;, and the morning canticles of &quot;Te Deum, Benedicite, Benedictus, Jubilate&quot; and a &quot;Kyrie&quot;.

; Evening Service

: Evening Prayer, also known as Evensong, consists of preces and responses, Psalms, canticles, hymns and an anthem (see below). The evening canticles are the &quot;Magnificat&quot; and the &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot;, and these texts have been set to music by many composers. Herbert Howells alone composed 20 settings of the canticles, including his &quot;Collegium Regale&quot; (1944) and &quot;St Paul&#x27;s&quot; (1950) services. Like Mattins, Evensong is a service that is a distinctively Anglican service, originating in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1549 as a combination of the offices of Vespers and Compline. Choral Evensong is sung daily in most Church of England cathedrals, as well as in churches and cathedrals throughout the Anglican Communion. It is noted for its particular appeal to worshippers and visitors, attracting both believers and atheists with its meditative quality and cultural value. A service of Choral Evensong is broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 3, a tradition begun in 1926.

===Preces and responses ===

The Preces (or versicles) and responses are a set of prayers from the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for both Morning and Evening Prayer. They may be sung antiphonally by the priest (or a lay cantor) and choir. There are a number of popular choral settings by composers such as William Smith or Bernard Rose; alternatively, they may be sung as plainsong with a congregation.

===Psalms===

Morning and Evening Prayer (and sometimes Holy Communion) include a Psalm or Psalms, chosen according to the lectionary of the day. This may be sung by the choir or , either to plainsong, or to a distinctive type of chant known as Anglican chant by the choir or congregation.

===Anthems or motets===

Part-way through a service of worship, a choir may sing an anthem or motet, a standalone piece of sacred choral music, which is not part of the liturgy but is usually chosen to reflect to the liturgical theme of the day.

===Hymns===
The singing of hymns is a common feature of Anglican worship and usually includes congregational singing as well as a choir. An Introit hymn is sung at the start of a service, a Gradual hymn precedes the Gospel, an Offertory hymn is sung during the Offertory and a recessional hymn at the close of a service.

===Organ voluntary===
A piece for organ, known as a voluntary, is often played at the end of a service after the recessional hymn and dismissal.

==Performance==

Almost all Anglican church music is written for choir with or without organ accompaniment. Adult singers in a cathedral choir are often referred to as &quot;lay clerks&quot;, while children may be referred to as &quot;choristers&quot; or trebles. In certain places of worship, such as Winchester College in England, the more archaic spelling &quot;quirister&quot; is used.

An Anglican choir typically uses &quot;SATB&quot; voices (soprano or treble, alto or counter-tenor, tenor, and bass), though in many works some or all of these voices are divided into two for part or all of the piece; in this case the two halves of the choir (one on each side of the aisle) are traditionally named decani and cantoris which sing, respectively, Choir 1 and Choir 2 in two-choir music. There may also be soloists, usually only for part of the piece. There are also works for fewer voices, such as those written for solely men&#x27;s voices or boys&#x27;/women&#x27;s voices.

==Vestments==
At traditional Anglican choral services, a choir is &quot;vested&quot;, i.e. clothed in special ceremonial vestments. These are normally a cassock, a long, full-length robe which may be purple, red or black in colour, over which is worn a surplice, a knee-length white cotton robe. Normally a surplice is only worn during a service of worship, so a choir often rehearses wearing cassocks only. Younger choristers who have newly joined a choir begin to wear a surplice after an initial probationary period. Cassocks originated in the medieval period as day dress for clergy, but later came into liturgical use. Additionally, junior choristers may wear a ruff, an archaic form of dress collar, although this tradition is becoming less common. In some establishments, including the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Eton collars are worn.
Whist singing the offices, adult choir members may also wear an academic hood over their robes. In England, young choristers who have attained a certain level of proficiency with the Royal School of Church Music, an international educational organisation that promotes liturgical music, may wear an RSCM medallion.

==History==
Prior to the Reformation, music in British churches and cathedrals consisted mainly of Gregorian chant and polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass. The Anglican church did not exist as such, but the foundations of Anglican music were laid with music from the Catholic liturgy. The earliest surviving examples of European polyphony are found in the &quot;Winchester Tropers&quot;, a manuscript collection of liturgical choral music used at Winchester Cathedral, dating from the early-eleventh to mid-twelfth centuries. By the time of King Henry V in the fifteenth century, the music in English cathedrals, monasteries and collegiate churches had developed a distinctive and influential style known in Western Europe as the &quot;contenance angloise&quot;, whose chief proponent was the composer John Dunstable.

In the early 1530s, the break with Rome under King Henry VIII set in motion the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church and the Reformation in England. The Church of England&#x27;s Latin liturgy was replaced with scripture and prayers in English; the Great Bible in English was authorised in 1539 and Thomas Cranmer introduced the Book of Common Prayer in 1549. These changes were reflected in church music, and works that had previously been sung in Latin began to be replaced with new music in English. This gave rise to an era of great creativity during the Tudor period, in which composition of music for Anglican worship flourished. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, musicians of the Chapel Royal such as Thomas Tallis, Robert Parsons and William Byrd were called upon to demonstrate that the new Protestantism was no less splendid than the old Catholic religion. The defining characteristic of English polyphony was one-syllable-one-note, as opposed to continental polyphony, which was melismatic (multiple notes per syllable). Latin was only permitted in Oxford/Cambridge collegiate chapels where it could be understood by the congregation.

Following the events of the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I, Puritan influences took hold in the Church of England. Anglican church music became simpler in style, and services typically focused on morning and evening prayer. During the Restoration period, musical practices of the Baroque era found their way into Anglican worship, and stringed or brass instruments sometimes accompanied choirs. In the late 17th century, the composer Henry Purcell, who served as organist of both the Chapel Royal and Westminster Abbey, wrote many choral anthems and service settings. During the Georgian era, the music of George Frideric Handel was highly significant, with his repertoire of anthems, canticles and hymns, although he never held a church post.

Up until the early 19th century, most Anglican church music in England was centred around the cathedrals, where trained choirs would sing choral pieces in worship. Composers wrote music to make full use of the traditional cathedral layout of a segregated chancel area and the arrangement of choir stalls into rows of Decani and Cantoris, writing antiphonal anthems.

In parish churches, musical worship was limited to congregational singing of metrical psalms, often led by a largely untrained choir. A great quantity of simple tunes were published in the 18th and early 19th century for their use. From the mid-18th century, accompaniment began to be provided by a &quot;parish band&quot; of instruments such as the violin, cello, clarinet, flute and bassoon. These musicians would often sit in a gallery at the west end of the church, giving rise to the later term, &quot;west gallery music&quot;.

The tradition of a robed choir of men and boys was virtually unknown in Anglican parish churches until the early 19th century. Around 1839, a choral revival took hold in England, partially fuelled by the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive Catholic liturgical practice in Anglican churches. Despite opposition from more Puritan-minded Anglicans, ancient practices such as intoning the versicles and responses and chanted Psalms were introduced. The 16th century setting by John Merbecke for the Communion Service was revived in the 1840s and was almost universally adopted in parish churches. Composers active around this time included Samuel Sebastian Wesley and Charles Villiers Stanford. A number of grandiose settings of the Anglican morning and evening canticles for choir and organ were composed in the late 19th and early 20th century, including settings by Thomas Attwood Walmisley, Charles Wood, Thomas Tertius Noble, Basil Harwood and George Dyson, works which remain part of the Anglican choral repertoire today.

The singing of hymns was popularised within Anglicanism by the evangelical Methodist movement of the mid-18th century, but hymns, as opposed to metrical psalms, were not officially sanctioned as an integral part of Anglican Orders of Service until the early nineteenth century. From about 1800 parish churches started to use different hymn collections in informal service like the &quot;Lock Hospital Collection&quot; (1769) by Martin Madan, the &quot;Olney hymns&quot; (1779) by John Newton and William Cowper and &quot;A Collection of Hymns for the Use of The People Called Methodists&quot; (1779) by John Wesley and Charles Wesley. In 1820, the parishioners of a church in Sheffield took their parish priest to court when he tried to introduce hymns into Sunday worship; the judgement was ambiguous, but the matter was settled in the same year by Vernon Harcourt, the Archbishop of York, who sanctioned their use at services. Anglican hymnody was revitalised by the Oxford Movement and led to the publication hymnals such as &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; (1861). The &quot;English Hymnal&quot;, edited by Percy Dearmer and Ralph Vaughan Williams, was published in 1906, and became one of the most influential hymn books ever published. It was supplanted in 1986 by the &quot;New English Hymnal&quot;.

The acceptance of hymns in Anglican liturgy led to the adoption of the folk tradition of Christmas carol singing during the 19th century, the popularity of which was enhanced by Albert, Prince Consort teaching German carols to the royal family. The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols originated at Truro Cathedral in 1888 as a means of attracting people away from pubs on Christmas Eve; a revised version was adopted at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, first broadcast on BBC radio in 1928 and has now become an annual tradition, transmitted around the world. This has done much to popularise church music, as well as published collections such as &quot;Oxford Book of Carols&quot; (1928) and &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot;. Following the early music revival of the mid-20th century, the publication of collections such as the &quot;Oxford Book of Tudor Anthems&quot; encouraged renewed interest in 17th-century composers such as Byrd and Tallis.

In all but the smallest churches the congregation was until recently confined to the singing of hymns. Over the past half century or so efforts have been made to increase the role of the congregation and also to introduce more &quot;popular&quot; musical styles in the evangelical and charismatic leaning congregations. Not all churches can boast a full SATB choir, and a repertoire of one-, two- and three-part music is more suitable for many parish church choirs, a fact which is recognised in the current work of the Royal School of Church Music.

Anglican churches also frequently draw upon the musical traditions of other Christian denominations. Works by Catholic composers such as Mozart, Lutherans such as Bach, Calvinists like Mendelssohn, and composers from other branches of Christianity are often featured. This is particularly the case in music for the Mass in Anglo-Catholic churches, much of which is taken from the work of Roman Catholic composers.

Traditionally, Anglican choirs were exclusively male, due to a belief that girls&#x27; voices produced a different sound. However, recent research has shown that given the same training, the voices of girls and boys cannot be told apart, save for an interval from the C above middle C to the F above that. Salisbury Cathedral started a girls&#x27; choir in 1991 and others have since followed suit. There has been some concern that having mixed choirs in parish churches leads to fewer boys being willing to participate.

<text>Peter Forsskål, sometimes spelled Pehr Forsskål, Peter Forskaol, Petrus Forskål or Pehr Forsskåhl (11 January 1732 – 11 July 1763) was a Swedish explorer, orientalist, naturalist, and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus.

==Early life==

Forsskål was born in Helsinki, now in Finland but then a part of Sweden, where his father, the priest , was serving as a Lutheran clergyman, but the family moved to Sweden in 1741 when the father was appointed to the parish of Tegelsmora in Uppland and the archdiocese of Uppsala. As was common at the time, he enrolled at Uppsala University at a young age in 1742, but returned home for some time and, after studies on his own, rematriculated in Uppsala in 1751, where he completed a theological degree the same year.

==Linnaeus&#x27;s disciple==

In Uppsala Forsskål was one of the students of Linnaeus, but apparently also studied with the orientalist Carl Aurivillius, whose contacts with the Göttingen orientalist Johann David Michaelis are probably the reason why Forsskål travelled to the University of Göttingen in 1753; he studied Oriental languages and Philosophy and completed a doctorate there with a dissertation entitled &quot;Dubia de principiis philosophiae recentioris&quot; (1756). Returning to Uppsala in 1756, he wanted to pursue studies in economics.

In November 1759, he published a political pamphlet called, in Swedish, &quot;Tankar om borgerliga friheten&quot; (Thoughts on civil liberty). As it advocated complete freedom of the press, it was at the time controversial and was consequently suppressed by the authorities on the day of publication. The pamphlet was censored by the &quot;Hats&quot; government and caused him to be warned by the Royal Chancellery.

==Journey to Yemen and death==

On Michaelis&#x27;s recommendation, and with Linnaeus&#x27;s approval, Forsskål the next year (1760) was appointed by Frederick V of Denmark to join, amongst others, the orientalist and mathematician Carsten Niebuhr on an expedition to Arabia. The group first went to Egypt where they stayed for about a year, with Forsskål pursuing studies in Arabic dialects, and arrived in South Arabia (Arabia Felix, present-day Yemen) at the end of December 1762. Just 31 years old, Forsskål worked hard on collecting botanical and zoological specimens, but fell ill with malaria and died in July 1763. He was buried at night in Yarim, Yemen.

Linnaeus mourned the death of his young student and named one of the plants Forsskål had sent home &quot;Forsskaolea tenacissima&quot; because the plant was as stubborn and persistent as the young man had been.

The entire journey of this Danish expedition was the subject of Thorkild Hansen&#x27;s first book, &quot;Det lykkelige Arabien&quot; (1962, translated into English as &quot;Arabia Felix&quot;).

==Legacy==

Forsskål&#x27;s companion Niebuhr, who was the only one of the participants to survive the expedition, was entrusted with the care of editing his manuscripts, and published in 1775 &quot;Descriptiones Animalium – Avium, amphiborum, insectorum, vermium quæ in itinere orientali observavit Petrus Forskål&quot;. In the same year his account of the plants of Yemen and of lower Egypt also appeared, under the title of &quot;Flora Ægyptiaco-Arabica sive descriptiones plantarum quas per Ægyptum Inferiorem et Arabiam felicem detexit, illustravit Petrus Forskål&quot;. Most of his specimens were lost in transport or deteriorated due to bad storage in Copenhagen; his herbarium was reconstructed some 150 years after his death by the botanist Carl Christensen.

In his taxonomy work, Forsskål assigned the local Arabic name of the fish as the Latin species name: so they reflect the names used then (and now) on the coasts of the Red Sea for many species of fish.

In his pamphlet, &quot;Thoughts on Civil Liberty&quot; (1759), Forsskål argues the case for civil liberties of the kind people in modern democracies take for granted. A sample (para 21):

Finally, another important right in any free society is the liberty to contribute to the Public Good. But for this to happen, it must be possible to make the state of affairs in society known to one and all, and everyone must be free to express their thoughts about it. Where this is lacking, liberty is not worth its name.

Shortly after its publication the pamphlet was banned, and Forsskål was forced into exile. But only seven years later, in 1766, freedom of the press was given protection in Swedish constitutional law – the first such legislation in world history. (Under the reign of Gustaf III Sweden fell back into repression. Freedom of the press was reinstated in the Constitution of 1809.)

== Species named in his honor ==

The tiger fish &quot;Hydrocynus forskahlii&quot; was named in his honor by Georges Cuvier. Forsskål originally reported this species as &quot;Salmo (=Alestes) dentex&quot; in 1775.

The siphonophore &quot;Forskalia&quot; in the monotypic family Forskaliidae was named in his honor by Kölliker.

The black sea cucumber &quot;Holothuria forskali&quot; was named in his honor by Delle Chiaje.

The plant genus &quot;Forsskaolea&quot; L. was named in his honor.

Many plants also bear his name in the epithet, among which :
*&quot;Gymnosporia forsskaoliana&quot; (Sebsebe) Jordaan, Celastraceae.
*&quot;Dracaena forskaliana&quot; (Schult. f.) Byng &amp; Christenh., Asparagaceae.
*&quot;Cynanchum forskaolianum&quot; (Schult.) Meve &amp; Liede, Apocynaceae.
*&quot;Viola forskaalii&quot; Greuter, Violaceae.
*&quot;Centropodia forskaolii&quot; (Vahl) Cope, Poaceae.
*&quot;Helichrysum forskahlii&quot; (J. F. Gmel.) Hilliard &amp; B. L. Burtt, Asteraceae.
*&quot;Aneilema forskaolii&quot; Kunth, Commelinaceae.
*&quot;Ruellia forsskaolii&quot; Thulin, Acanthaceae.

His name is one of those with most variants, as botanists are free to choose their latinization, and the transcription to the vowel å has varied through time.

==Variant spellings of his name==
In subsequent botanical works many different variants of his name were recorded (Forsskål, Forskål, Forskåhl, Forsskåhl, Forsskaal, Forskal, Forsskal, occasionally also Forsskaol). For citing the scientist&#x27;s name it was recommended not to replace å by a. Family members in these times used three alternative spellings Forsskål, Forskål and Forsskåhl. Modern members of the family seem to prefer Forsskåhl. Peter&#x27;s father and brother used the spelling Forsskåhl. Peter himself alternatively used Forsskål and Forsskaal, in approximately the same frequency, but the choice depended on the language of a letter&#x27;s recipient. In one letter to England he once spelled his name Forsskol. Linnæus spelled Peter&#x27;s name Forskåhl, not in agreement with the student&#x27;s father. In publications issued during Peter&#x27;s lifetime the spelling Forsskål was used, including in his dissertation issued in 1756 in Göttingen.

In the important work &quot;Descriptiones animalium&quot; which was published 12 years after his death and which was attributed to him the spelling &quot;Forskål&quot; had been used. In current zoological sources both spellings Forskål and Forsskål are in use, Forskåhl and Forsskåhl are not used.

<doc id="982292" wikidata="Q683170" url="?curid=982292" title="S. C. Johnson &amp; Son">
<text>S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (commonly referred to as S. C. Johnson) is an American multinational corporation, privately held manufacturer of household cleaning supplies and other consumer chemicals based in Racine, Wisconsin. In 2017, S. C. Johnson employed approximately 13,000 people and had estimated sales of $10 billion.

The company is owned by the Johnson family. H. Fisk Johnson, Chairman and CEO since 2004, is the fifth generation of the Johnson family to lead the company.

== History ==
The company is one of the oldest family-owned businesses in the U.S., beginning in 1886 when Samuel Curtis Johnson purchased the parquet flooring division from the Racine Hardware Manufacturing Company and named the new business S. C. Johnson. The company&#x27;s principal product at that time was parquet flooring, later adding other floor care products such as Johnson&#x27;s Prepared Wax, Johnson&#x27;s Dance Wax, and Johnson&#x27;s Wood Dye.

Under Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr., the company expanded worldwide, establishing its first subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1914. Giving his employees credit for a successful year, Herbert gave them $35,000 in 1917. In 1932, SC Johnson introduced Johnson&#x27;s Glo-Coat. The success of Glo-Coat bolstered the company during the Great Depression. S. C. Johnson&#x27;s line of wax-reliant products necessitated Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.’s 1935 expedition to Fortaleza, Brazil, to find a direct sustainable source of wax.

From April 1935 until May 1950, the company was the sponsor for the Fibber McGee and Molly radio show, officially known as &quot;The Johnson Wax Program&quot;. During the 1950s, the company served as sponsor of the game show, &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;. The company went on to co-sponsor &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; on NBC, and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; on CBS.

In April 1939, the Frank Lloyd Wright–designed SC Johnson Administration Building opened. Its addition, the Research Tower, opened in 1950. The SC Johnson Headquarters was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974.

The launch of Raid House &amp; Garden Bug Killer in 1955 marked the company&#x27;s first major departure away from wax-based products. Within the next few years, Sam Johnson, fourth generation leader, introduced some of the company&#x27;s best known brands: Glade, OFF!, and Pledge.

In April 2018, the company updated its tagline from &quot;A Family Company&quot;, which began in 1998, to &quot;A Family Company at Work for a Better World&quot;. According to the company, the updated tagline is &quot;A reminder that SC Johnson holds itself to a higher standard.&quot;

== Environmental record ==
In 2011, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son settled a lawsuit that alleged the company&#x27;s Greenlist label misled consumers into believing the products were reviewed by a third party and given a seal of approval. The company agreed to an undisclosed sum and dropped the labeling of Greenlist on Windex.

S. C. Johnson &amp; Son is the main sponsor of the Serra das Almas Private Natural Heritage Reserve in the states of Ceará and Piauí, Brazil. The reserve protects an area of the caatinga biome, including wild specimens of the carnauba palm tree (Copernicia prunifera), the source of carnauba wax.

On December 18, 2012, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son began operation of two wind turbines at their largest manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The turbines, in addition to the gas reclamation system in place at a nearby landfill, are estimated to produce enough electricity to completely power the facility.

In 2017 S. C. Johnson purchased the ecological product Ecover and Method brands on undisclosed terms.

== Controversy ==
A RICO lawsuit by tax whistleblower Mike DeGuelle alleges that since 1997, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son has taken advantage of audit errors and filed fraudulent tax returns, underpaying its taxes by millions of dollars. H. Fisk Johnson ordered an inquiry into the allegations, and told Tax Analysts that he learned &quot;other details of the decisions they (the tax department) made that I didn&#x27;t like. I didn&#x27;t like what I heard.&quot; On December 15, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Case No. 10-2172, ruled that DeGuelle had alleged a valid claim that the company&#x27;s discharge of him was part of the tax fraud scheme. DeGuelle&#x27;s claim was reviewed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin with the Court ruling to dismiss the RICO lawsuit on the grounds of preclusion. The Court did not rule on SC Johnson&#x27;s actions as they pertain to tax evasion, with Judge Stadtmueler stating that &quot;the legality of SC Johnson&#x27;s actions (and whether those actions did, in fact, occur) is of no importance to the Court&#x27;s consideration of the defendant&#x27;s motion for summary judgment.&quot; The Wisconsin Court of Appeals reviewed DeGuelle&#x27;s case and affirmed an earlier ruling of the Racine County Circuit Court in favor of SC Johnson for defamation related to Deguelle&#x27;s claims of tax evasion and breach of a confidentiality agreement.

S. C. Johnson &amp; Son was one of 13 large consumer product companies who were together fined €948.9million by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products. At the time, it was the largest single fine ever imposed by Autorité de la Concurrence.

In March 2022, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son faced public scrutiny after its decision to continue to operate in Russia despite widespread sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company was reported to have stopped new investments and scaled back unspecified operations as of April 1, 2022.

<text>Anglican chant, also known as English chant, is a way to sing unmetrical texts, including psalms and canticles from the Bible, by matching the natural speech-rhythm of the words to the notes of a simple harmonized melody. This distinctive type of chant is a significant element of Anglican church music.

Anglican chant was formerly in widespread use in Anglican and Episcopal churches, but today, Anglican chant is sung primarily in Anglican cathedrals and parish churches that have retained a choral liturgical tradition. Additionally, Anglican chant may be sung in Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Reformed churches.

Anglican chant grew out of the plainchant tradition during the English Reformation. When singing a text in Anglican chant, the natural rhythm of the words as they would be spoken by a careful speaker governs how the music is fitted to the words. The majority of the words are freely and rhythmically chanted over the &quot;reciting notes&quot;, which are found in the first, fourth, eighth, eleventh (etc.) bars of the chant and with the other notes of the music appropriately fitted to the words at the end of each half-verse. Formerly the rhythm of the non-reciting notes was strictly observed, but nowadays the rhythm is based on the natural cadence of speech. Thus, the length of each of these notes bears little relation to the normal musical value of a note such as a minim or semibreve.

Anglican chant was well established by the 18th century. The earliest known examples are single chants written by John Blow, Henry Purcell, and their contemporaries. Earlier examples by Tudor composers such as Tallis, Farrant, and others are not original. The earliest double chants are from about 1700.

==Method==
The text is pointed for chanting by assigning each verse or phrase to a simple harmonised melody of 7, 14, 21 or 28 bars (known respectively as a single, double, triple or quadruple chant).

An example of a single chant is shown above. Below are the first four verses of the Magnificat, with the text coloured to show which words correspond to which notes in the music (&quot;the chant&quot;).
:1. My soul doth &#x27; magnify the &#x27; Lord : And my spirit hath re&#x27;joiced in &#x27; God my &#x27; Saviour.
:2. For &#x27; he hath re&#x27;garded : the &#x27; lowliness &#x27; of his &#x27; handmaiden.
:3. For be&#x27;hold from &#x27; henceforth : all gene &#x27; rations shall &#x27; call me &#x27; blessed.
:4. For he that is mighty hath &#x27; magnified &#x27; me : and &#x27; holy &#x27; is his &#x27; Name.

Another example of the color-pointed text for chant scores is the Vox Barnabas Psalter, a collection of public domain double chant scores by St. Barnabas Chorus, used to sing their Daily Office in Chant podcast of Morning, Noon, Evensong and Compline. 

Various psalters have been published over the years, with each one showing how the chant is to be fitted to the words and each having its own variation on the precise rules for doing so. The rules used in the &quot;Parish Psalter&quot; (one of the more popular psalters, edited by Sydney Nicholson) are as follows:
* Each verse is sung to seven bars of music (the whole chant in the example above, though most chants are 14 bars = 2 verses long)
* The bar lines in the music correspond to the &quot;pointing marks&quot; which are shown above as inverted commas or apostrophes in the text.
* The double bar line in the music corresponds to the colon in the text.
* Where there is one note (a semibreve) to a bar, all the words for the corresponding part of the text are sung to that one note.
* Where there are two notes (two minims) to a bar, unless indicated otherwise all the words &quot;except the last syllable&quot; are sung to the first minim. The final syllable is sung to the second minim. Where more than the last syllable is to be sung to the second minim, a dot (·) (between words) or a hyphen (within a word) is used in the text to indicate where the note change should occur.

Other psalters use different notation; modern psalters such as the &quot;New St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Psalter&quot; (John Scott, 1997) have adopted the following convention:
* A vertical bar (|) is used to indicate a barline.
* Whenever there are 3 or more syllables in a bar containing two minims, a dot (·) or hyphen is used, even if the change of note is on the final syllable.

There are various additional rules which apply occasionally:
* Some chants have more complicated rhythms than the example above, generally in the form of a dotted minim and a crotchet (in any bar except the last of a quarter) or of two crotchets taking the place of a minim.
* When a minim in an internal bar (i.e. not the first or last bar of a quarter) is replaced by two crotchets, one of two things happens. If there is only one syllable, both notes are sung to it in quick succession. If there are two (or occasionally more) syllables, they are split as appropriate to smoothly match the rhythm of the words to the two notes.
* When an internal bar has a dotted rhythm, it is to be sung as above, excepting that the crotchet can be omitted from the music if the natural rhythm of the words and the sentiment of the words indicate that it is appropriate to do so.
* When the first bar of a quarter has a dotted minim and a crotchet, all syllables except the last are sung to the note of the dotted minim, with the crotchet being tucked in on the last syllable before the barline. If there is only one syllable, both notes are sung to it in quick succession with the subtle emphasis being on the first note.
* Sometimes the last bar of a quarter has two minims instead of the usual semibreve, in which case a dot/hyphen may be required after the last barline in the text: (e.g. even as &#x27; though they &#x27; were mine &#x27; ene-mies.)
* Particularly in long psalms, changes of chant may be used to signal thematic shifts in the words. Psalm 119, which is the longest in the psalter, is generally sung with a change of chant after every 8 of its 176 verses, corresponding to the 22 stanzas of the original Hebrew text. However, it is never sung all at once, but spread over successive days.

==Double, triple and quadruple chants==
The example above is a single chant. This is mostly only used for very short psalms (half a dozen verses or so).

The most commonly used chants are &quot;double chants&quot;. These are twice the length of a single chant. The music of the chant is repeated for every pair of verses. This reflects the structure of the Hebrew poetry of many of the psalms: Each verse is in two halves – the second half answers the first; the verses are in pairs – the second verse answers the first.

&quot;Triple&quot; and &quot;quadruple chants&quot; are considerably rarer. They appeared from the latter part of the 19th century to cover some of the exceptions to this format. They set the verses of the psalm in groups of three or four verses respectively. Psalm 2 (for example) is suited to a triple chant; a quadruple chant might be used for Psalm 78.

A double chant is divided into &quot;quarters&quot;, each of which has the music for half a verse. Triple and quadruple chants may also be described as containing six or eight quarters.

If the entire text (or a section of it) has an odd number of verses, the second half of the chant is usually repeated at an appropriate point, which may be marked &quot;2nd part&quot;. Similarly, &quot;3rd part&quot; markings may be used for triple chants.

An example of a double chant:
Below are the four lines of the doxology &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Gloria&quot;), with the text coloured to show which words correspond to which notes in the music (pointing varies from choir to choir):

Glory be to the Father, and &#x27; to the &#x27; Son : and &#x27; to the &#x27; Holy &#x27; Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and &#x27; ever &#x27; shall be : world without &#x27; end A &#x27; - - &#x27; men.

The doxology &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, usually sung at the end of a psalm or canticle, is two verses long. Depending on the type of chant, it is sung in one of the following ways:
*to a single chant sung twice,
*to a double chant,
*to an appropriate 14 bars (usually specified by the composer) of a triple chant or quadruple chant.

==Accompaniment==
Psalms may be sung unaccompanied or accompanied by an organ or other instrument. Organists use a variety of registrations to mirror the changing mood of the words from verse to verse; but the organ should never be so loud that the words cannot be clearly heard. Organists may sometimes utilize word painting, using effects such as a deep pedal note on the word &quot;thunder&quot;, or a harsh reed tone for &quot;darkness&quot; contrasting with a mixture for &quot;light&quot;.

==Antiphonal singing==
A further stylistic technique is used in cathedrals and churches which use an antiphonal style of singing. In this case, the choir is divided into two equal half-choirs, each having representation for the four musical parts, and usually facing one another. They are typically named &quot;Decani&quot; (usually the half-choir to the south side) and &quot;Cantoris&quot; (usually the half-choir to the north side). Then the choir may employ either of the techniques known as &quot;quarter-chanting&quot; and &quot;half-chanting&quot;. In quarter-chanting (which is more true to the structure of the Hebrew poetry), the side that starts (usually decani) sing the first quarter of the chant (and thus the first half of the verse). The side that did not start (usually cantoris) then sing the second quarter of the chant (and thus the second half of the verse). This sequence then repeats. In half-chanting (which is more true to antiphonal singing in the Gregorian style), decani sing the first two quarters of the chant, and cantoris the next two quarters (so that each half-choir sings a whole verse at a time).

With antiphonal singing, the first two verses, the &quot;Gloria&quot; and perhaps the last two verses are often sung by the whole choir.

A few choirs elaborate further, e.g. by having some verses sung by soloists, trebles only, alto/tenor/bass only (with the treble line transferred into one of the other parts) or one part or soloists singing the melody while the rest of the choir hums. Occasionally some or all trebles may sing a descant; this usually happens only in the final verse of the psalm or the Gloria.

<text>Ghetonia (Griko: Γειτονία, &quot;neighborhood&quot;) is a cultural group based in Calimera, Grecìa Salentina in southern Italy, which exists to preserve the music, poetry, language and folklore of the Griko-speaking people of Salento by documenting the various aspects of the Grecìa Salentina traditional life, history, language and folklore, and has published extensively on these subjects. However, Ghetonia is best known for its musical group whose members include Roberto Licci, Emilia Ottaviano, Salvatore Cotardo, Emmanuelle Licci, Angelo Urso and Franco Nuzzo.

== History ==
Born in 1992 from the idea of Roberto Licci (voice and guitar, member of the Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino), Salvatore Cotardo (sax) and Pierangelo Colucci with the aim of recovering the ancient local musical and cultural traditions. From the very beginning their music also recovered the ancient cultural belonging of Salento to the Mediterranean, which for some decades had been forgotten to pursue Western development models which later turned out to be ephemeral. Thanks in particular to Colucci and his knowledge of Arabic music and instruments, Ghetonìa were the first to use Mediterranean rhythms and sounds in their arrangements, a current that is today the most fertile but which in the early nineties was an absolute novelty.

The group has given numerous concerts not only in Italy but also abroad, especially in Greece, but also in the Balkans, Cuba and the USA where they were invited by the World Music Institute.

<doc id="982336" wikidata="Q236985" url="?curid=982336" title="Helene Schjerfbeck">
<text>Helena Sofia (Helene) Schjerfbeck (; July 10, 1862 – January 23, 1946) was a Finnish modernist painter known for her realist works and self-portraits, and also for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life her work changed dramatically, beginning with French-influenced realism and &quot;plein air&quot; painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings. At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the &quot;Wounded Warrior in the Snow&quot; (1880), &quot;At the Door of Linköping Jail in 1600&quot; (1882) and &quot;The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin&quot; (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism, and her works from mostly the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life.

Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of late-19th-century academic realism…it ends with distilled, nearly abstract images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect balance. (Roberta Smith, New York Times, November 27, 1992)

Schjerbeck&#x27;s birthday, July 10, is Finland&#x27;s national day for the painted arts.

== Early life ==

Helena Sofia Schjerfbeck was born on July 10, 1862, in Helsinki, in the autonomous Grand-Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire, to Svante Schjerfbeck (an office manager) and Olga Johanna (née Printz). She had one surviving brother, Magnus Schjerfbeck (1860–1933), who went on to become an architect. In 1866, aged 4, she fell down some stairs injuring her hip, which prevented her from attending school and left her with a limp for the rest of her life. She showed talent at an early age, and at eleven years old in 1873 she was enrolled at the Finnish Art Society School of Drawing. Her fees were paid by Adolf von Becker, who saw promise in her. At this school Schjerfbeck met Helena Westermarck. These two, and artist Maria Wiik and lesser-known Ada Thilén had a close friendship during their lives.

When Schjerfbeck&#x27;s father died of tuberculosis, on February 2, 1876, Schjerfbeck&#x27;s mother took in boarders so that they could get by. A little over a year after her father&#x27;s death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck and paid for by Professor , at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the University of Helsinki drawing studio. There, Becker himself taught her French oil painting techniques.

In 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at Sjundby Manor, owned by her aunt on her mother&#x27;s side Selma Printz and her husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age. Later in 1880 she set off to Paris after receiving a travel grant from the Imperial Russian Senate.

==Career==
===Paris===
In Paris, Schjerfbeck painted with Helena Westermarck, then left to study with Léon Bonnat at Mme Trélat de Vigny&#x27;s studio. In 1881 she moved to the Académie Colarossi, where she studied once again with Westermarck. The Imperial Senate gave her another scholarship, which she used to spend a couple of months in Meudon, and then a few more months in Pont-Aven a small fishing in Concarneau, Brittany. She then went back to the Académie Colarossi briefly, before returning to the in Finland. Schjerfbeck continued to move around frequently, painting and studying with various people. Schjerfbeck made money by continuing to put her paintings in the Art Society&#x27;s exhibitions, and she also did illustrations for books. After returning to Finland in 1882, in 1884 she was back in Paris at the Académie Colarossi with Westermarck, but this time they were working there. During this time she participated in Académie des Beaux-Arts’ The Salon and painted again in Brittany. In the chapel of Trèmolo near the village of Pont-Aven Schjerfbeck produced the painting &quot;The Door&quot; (1884).

===Engagement and travels===
In late Autumn 1883, Schjerfbeck got engaged to a Swedish painter Otto Hagborg who also lived in Pont-Aven in the winter and spring of 1883–1884. The engagement, however, came to an end in 1885 when a problem with Schjerfbeck&#x27;s hip led the groom&#x27;s family to suspect tuberculosis. In reality the issue was a result of her fall during childhood. Schjerfbeck never married.

After spending a year in Finland, Schjerfbeck travelled again to Paris in the autumn of 1886. Schjerfbeck was given more money to travel by a man from the Finnish Art Society and in 1887 she travelled to St Ives, Cornwall, in Britain. There she painted &quot;The Bakery&quot; (1887) and &quot;The Convalescent&quot;, the latter winning the bronze medal at the 1889 Paris World Fair. The painting was later bought by the Finnish Art Society. During this period Schjerfbeck was painting in a naturalistic plein-air style.

===Teaching and sanatorium===
In the 1890s Schjerfbeck started teaching regularly in Finland at the Art Society drawing school, now the Academy of Fine Arts. Hilda Flodin was one of her students. However, in 1901 she became too ill to teach and in 1902 she resigned from her post. She moved to Hyvinkää, which was known for its sanatorium, all while taking care of her mother who lived with her (the mother died in 1923). While living in Hyvinkää, she continued to paint and exhibit. &quot;Schjerfbeck’s sole contact with the art world was through magazines sent by friends.&quot; Since she did not have art, Schjerfbeck took up hobbies like reading and embroidery.

During this time Schjerbeck produced still lifes and landscape paintings, as well as portraits, such as that of her mother, local school girls and women workers, and also self-portraits, and she became a modernist painter. Her work has been compared to that of artists such as James McNeill Whistler and Edvard Munch, but from 1905 her paintings took on a character that was hers alone. She continued experimenting with various techniques such as using different types of underpainting.

===Exhibitions===
In 1913 Schjerfbeck met the art-dealer , with whose encouragement she exhibited at Malmö in 1914, Stockholm in 1916 and St Petersburg in 1917. In 1917 Stenman organised her first solo exhibition and in that year Einar Reuter (alias H. Ahtela) published the first Schjerfbeck monograph. Later she exhibited at Copenhagen (1919), Gothenburg (1923) and Stockholm (1934). In 1937 Stenman organised another solo exhibition for her in Stockholm, and in 1938 he began paying her a monthly stipend. Her paintings were successfully displayed in several exhibitions in Sweden in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Later years and death ==
As the years passed, Schjerfbeck travelled less. When a family matter arose she would return to her home city of Helsinki and she spent most of 1920 in Ekenäs, but by 1921 she was back living in Hyvinkää.

For about a year, Schjerfbeck moved to a farm in Tenala to avoid the December 1939–March 1940 Winter War, but returned to Ekenäs in the middle of 1940. She later moved into a nursing home, where she resided for less than a year before moving to the Luontola sanatorium. In 1944 she moved into the Saltsjöbaden spa hotel in Sweden, where she continued to paint actively even during her last years; e.g. the series of self-portraits.

She died on January 23, 1946, and was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

== Work ==
&quot;Dancing Shoes&quot; is one of Schjerfbeck&#x27;s most popular paintings and she returned to the theme three times, and executed a lithograph of it that catapulted the painting to international fame. It depicts her cousin Esther Lupander, who had extremely long legs, which led to the painting being nicknamed &quot;The Grasshopper&quot;. Executed in Realist style, the painting shows the clear influence of Schjerfbeck&#x27;s stay in Paris, where she had expressed admiration for Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt. It fetched £3,044,500 at a 2008 Sotheby&#x27;s London sale.

&quot;Girl with Blonde Hair&quot; (1916) is an example of Schjerfbeck&#x27;s mature style, drawing on French Modernism. The work belongs to a series (including also &quot;The Family Heirloom&quot; of the same year) depicting neighbours of Schjerfbeck, Jenny and Impi Tamlander, who ran errands for Schjerfbeck and her mother and helped look after the family home. Here the sitter is Impi. The painting realized £869,000 at a 2015 Sotheby&#x27;s London sale. Schjerfbeck&#x27;s work was included in the 2018 exhibition &quot;Women in Paris 1850–1900&quot;.

==Legacy==
Art forger was an admirer of her works, and writes of his time forging them: &quot;By encroaching on Schjerfbeck I felt like I had violated something sacred. It was if I had broken into a sacristy to steal the church silver.&quot; Fellow forger and self-admitted seller of 60 Schjerfbeck counterfeits Jouni Ranta was more critical and considered that her fame was undeserved.

The 2003 biographical novel &quot;Helene&quot; by Rakel Liehu was a critical and commercial success, and won the 2004 Runeberg Prize. It also formed the basis of a 2020 film by the same name, directed by Antti Jokinen and starring Laura Birn as Schjerfbeck, which was nominated for an award in the feature-length category at the Shanghai International Film Festival.

===Exhibitions===
* From 20 July to 27 October 2019, the Royal Academy set up an exhibition with over 60 paintings, landscapes and still lifes, remarking the evolution of her career.

<text>The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust (JRCT) is a philanthropic grant-making trust that supports work undertaken in the UK and Ireland, and previously South Africa. It is one of three original trusts set up by Joseph Rowntree in 1904. The Trust supports work in five programme areas: peace and security, rights and justice, power and accountability, sustainable future and Northern Ireland.

==History==
In 1904, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust (JRCT), along with sister organisations the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, were created by Joseph Rowntree, who gave about a half of his wealth to establish them. The original trustees of the JRCT were: Rowntree, his sons John Wilhelm, Benjamin Seebohm, Joseph Stephenson and Oscar Frederick, and his nephew Arnold Stephenson Rowntree. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust&#x27;s values are rooted in Quakerism. Joseph Rowntree, who was a Quaker, believed that it is only possible to make a lasting difference by addressing the root causes of a social or economic problem. Quaker values include peace, equality, simplicity, integrity and stewardship of the earth.

==Current day==
The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust describes itself as &quot;a Quaker trust which seeks to transform the world by supporting people who address the root causes of conflict and injustice.&quot;

The Trust says that in order to engage in philanthropy that effects real change, &quot;JRCT does not shy away from supporting those working on unpopular or contentious issues&quot;. It also believes that change can &quot;take many years to achieve&quot;. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust offers grants to around 100 different charitable organisations a year.  In 2018 these included Reprieve, Fawcett Society, Operation Black Vote and Fair Tax Mark. It makes grants in excess of £10 million a year.

===Cage controversy===
The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said it works to &quot;strengthen the hands of those leading change&quot; and recognises that such work carries a level of risk.

Between 2007 and 2011, the trust gave three grants to CAGE, formerly known as Cageprisoners, described as a &quot;controversial Islamic rights group&quot;, totalling £305,000, to support the work of Moazzam Begg.

Cage describes itself as &quot;an independent organisation working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror&quot; and has spoken out against the UK&#x27;s anti-terrorism laws.

CAGE spokesman Asim Qureshi called on Muslims to support jihad at an extremist rally, and described militant Mohammed Emwazi, as a &quot;beautiful young man&quot;. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government&#x27;s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: &quot;I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners. I have concerns about the group. There are civil liberty organisations which I do give money to but CagePrisoners is most certainly not one of them.&quot;

Speaking in 2015, the human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith defended the &quot;vital&quot; work of Cage and denied they are apologists for terrorism. He said: &quot;They do important work and the UK authorities need to understand that alienating moderate Muslims is the worst thing that could possibly be done at this time. I myself represent those said to be &#x27;terrorists&#x27; and since Magna Carta, in 1215, we have presumed people innocent rather than guilty…it is clear beyond dispute that when we jettison our principles we make ourselves hypocrites and hypocrisy is the yeast that ferments extremism.&quot;

In October 2015, following an application for judicial review by Cage, the Charity Commission said it would not in future interfere in the discretion of charities to choose to fund Cage. The judicial review heard evidence that Theresa Villiers, a British Cabinet Minister, and US intelligence had both applied pressure on the charity commission to investigate Cage, with US intelligence agents describing Cage as a &quot;jihadist front&quot;.

===Ethical investment===
The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust invests its endowment sustainably and responsibly. It does not invest in the arms industry, gambling, the tobacco industry or nuclear power. The Trust has also divested from fossil fuel extractive companies. In 2019 it was among a coalition of 20 charities which asked the attorney-general and the Charity Commission for England and Wales to seek a ruling on whether the public benefit of charities means they should be required to align their investment policies with their own objectives and commitments to wider society.

In September 2019, JRCT was named a &quot;global leader&quot; by the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment for its commitment to ethical and responsible investment. The global leader group also included the Church Commissioners for England and the Environmental Agency Pension Fund.

<text>Brendan Daly (2 February 1940 – 6 July 2023) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He was a long-serving Teachta Dála (TD) for the Clare constituency, a government minister, and Senator.

==Life and career==
Daly was born on 2 February 1940 in Cooraclare, County Clare, and educated locally at CBS Kilrush school. His political career began at the 1973 general election, when he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for Clare. When Daly ran in the next general election in 1977, Limerick-based journalist Arthur Quinlan described him in the Irish Times as “a 37-year-old bundle of energy who has concentrated all his efforts on making his career out of politics”. Quinlan was sceptical that Daly would top the poll, but in the end he did so, getting elected on the first count. His first-preference total of 11,933 was more than double the figure of 5,758 he got in 1973 although he said: “I worked for every single vote I got&quot; He held his seat at five further general elections before losing it at the 1992 general election. He was returned at the 1997 general election but was defeated again in the 2002 general election.

Daly was a strong supporter of Charles Haughey during his period as Fianna Fáil leader. In 1980 Daly became Minister of State at the Department of Labour. In 1982 he joined the Cabinet as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. When Fianna Fáil returned to power after the 1987 general election he once again became a minister, this time as Minister for the Marine in the 20th Government of Ireland.

Daly was not re-appointed a minister when Fianna Fáil entered into coalition with the Progressive Democrats after the 1989 general election, but was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for Heritage Affairs and Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. He returned to the cabinet in February 1991 as Minister for Defence. In November Albert Reynolds and Pádraig Flynn were sacked from the government and Daly was appointed Minister for Social Welfare. His time in cabinet was short-lived; in February 1992, Haughey resigned as Taoiseach and was succeeded by Reynolds, who did not appoint Daly to cabinet. He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs from February 1992.

Daly lost his Dáil seat in the election that year, retaining his position as Minister of State until the formation of a new government in January 1993. He contested the Seanad election on the Agricultural Panel, and was returned to the 20th Seanad.

Daly was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1997 general election but lost his seat at the 2002 general election. He stood for election to the 22nd Seanad on the Labour Panel, and was returned to the Seanad for a second time. He was unsuccessful again at 2007 general election, and did not contest the subsequent elections to the 23rd Seanad. He then retired from public life.

Brendan Daly was married to Patricia Carmody of Kilrush, County Clare, from the early 1970s until her death in 2014; they had three children. Daly died on 6 July 2023, aged 83.

In the Dáil, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin paid tribute to Daly as “an extraordinarily committed public servant” who had served in several departments.

<text>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) is a charity that conducts and funds research aimed at solving poverty in the UK. JRF&#x27;s stated aim is to &quot;inspire action and change that will create a prosperous UK without poverty.&quot;

Originally called the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust, it was founded by English businessman Joseph Rowntree in 1904. Rowntree, a Quaker, was a long-standing philanthropist and with his brother developed a confectionery company, &quot;Rowntree&#x27;s&quot;. He established the foundation in order to investigate the root causes of social problems. In its current form, the foundation works with private, public and voluntary sectors, as well as impoverished people. It is politically neutral and independent from all UK political parties.

== History ==
JRF was established in 1904 by Joseph Rowntree to understand the root causes of social problems. Joseph was a visionary Quaker businessman and social reformer. Watching his father set up a York soup kitchen in the mid-1800s helped Joseph to realise that such actions were not comprehensive enough. This led to a shift in the Rowntrees&#x27; social action, from treating the symptoms to addressing the root causes of poverty. Joseph gave away half of his own fortune to set up various trusts; he was committed to understanding the causes of poverty and disadvantage in order to create a better society. He built New Earswick, a village in York, for people on low incomes, giving them access to decent homes at affordable rents.

Joseph&#x27;s son, Seebohm Rowntree, was also a pioneering social researcher who undertook one of the country’s first investigations into poverty. &quot;Poverty, A Study of Town Life&quot; (1901) influenced the Liberal Government&#x27;s introduction of Old Age Pensions (1908) and National Insurance (1911) as a means of protecting people from insecurity. His further studies of York (in 1936 and 1951) demonstrated the increasing effectiveness of welfare measures in anchoring the citizens of York in times of hardship. Seebohm Rowntree&#x27;s surveys were pivotal in a line of intellectual thinking that ended with Beveridge’s Welfare State. In addition his book, &quot;The Human Factor in Business&quot; (1921), set a standard for various workplace provisions; from pension schemes and industrial regulations to employee education and work’s councils. Such progressive measures led to him becoming an advisor to the Liberal PM David Lloyd George during the First World War. Seebohm helped to design welfare boards in the new state-owned munitions factories.

Both Joseph and Seebohm Rowntree had a clear vision about how to improve people&#x27;s lives. Joseph outlined these ideas in his &#x27;Founder&#x27;s Memorandum&#x27;, a blueprint for his early charitable work. Although it was written in 1904, many of its aims remain at the heart of JRF&#x27;s mission today: carrying out social research, and working to influence society and policy through robust evidence and communication.

== Current work ==

Areas of work cover:

* Cities, towns and neighbourhoods
* Housing
* Income and benefits
* People
* Society
* Work.

In February 2020, figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation showed that the proportion of people living in poverty in the United Kingdom who are in a working family is at a record high:
the proportion was 56% in 2018, up from 39% twenty years earlier in 1998.

<text>Noel Davern (24 December 1945 – 27 October 2013) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister of State from 1997 to 2002 and Minister for Education from 1991 to 1992. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary South constituency from 1969 to 1981 and 1987 to 2007. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1979 to 1984.

==Career==
Davern was born in Cashel, County Tipperary, in 1945. He was educated at CBS Cashel and at Franciscan College in County Meath. His family had a long political tradition. His father Michael Davern was a Fianna Fáil TD from 1948 to 1965, when he was succeeded in Dáil Éireann by Noel&#x27;s brother Don Davern. After Don&#x27;s sudden death in 1968, the seat remained vacant until Noel was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election.

At the 1979 European Parliament election he was elected as an MEP for the Munster constituency. He did not contest the 1981 general election so as to concentrate his time as an MEP. However, he lost his seat at the European Parliament at the 1984 European Parliament election.

Davern was again elected to the Dáil at the 1987 general election. In 1991, he was appointed to cabinet as Minister for Education in a reshuffle that followed a failed attempt of Albert Reynolds and Pádraig Flynn to oust Charles Haughey as taoiseach. Davern&#x27;s term in office was short-lived; when Reynolds succeeded as taoiseach in early 1992, Davern returned to the backbenches. In 1995, he became Opposition Spokesman on European Affairs when Bertie Ahern named his new front bench. Fianna Fáil were returned to government and Davern was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food. He served in that position until 2002.

Davern was one of only three members of the 29th Dáil who had first been elected in the 1960s, the others being Séamus Pattison, elected at the 1961 general election and Michael Smith, also elected at the 1969 general election.

He died on 27 October 2013.

<doc id="982356" wikidata="Q6981754" url="?curid=982356" title="Naval Aviation Supply Corps insignia">
<text>The Naval Aviation Supply Corps insignia is a military badge of the United States Navy which is awarded to Naval Aviation Supply Officers (NASOs) of the Navy Supply Corps who have qualified for duties as a Supply Officer in support of naval aviation and are also qualified to serve in duty assignments onboard aircraft carriers. The Aviation Supply Corps insignia is one of four warfare badges issued to Supply Corps officers by the U.S. Navy. The others are the Navy Expeditionary Supply Corps Officer Badge, Surface Warfare Supply Badge, and the Submarine Supply Corps Badge.

To be issued the insignia, a service member must complete a standard qualification program which includes supply procedures of a naval aviation unit, qualifications in certain aviation related watch stations, as well as an abbreviated amount of aviation knowledge which would normally be required for flight deck personnel.

Junior supply officers, assigned to aircraft carriers, Naval Air Stations or aviation squadrons, are granted between 18–24 months to qualify for the Aviation Supply Corps insignia. Reserve officers may take up to 36 months to qualify for their insignia, if assigned to a qualifying billet.

The Aviation Supply Corps insignia appears as a Naval Aviator Badge, in the center of which is positioned the Navy Supply Corps three oak leaf emblem. The insignia is also only authorized for officers, while enlisted supply personnel (such as those in the rate Logistics Specialist) are eligible to receive the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist Badge.

<doc id="982359" wikidata="Q3072931" url="?curid=982359" title="Graham Crowden">
<text>Clement Graham Crowden (30 November 1922 – 19 October 2010) was a Scottish actor. He was best known for his many appearances in television comedy dramas and films, often playing eccentric scientist, teacher and doctor characters.

==Early life==
Crowden was born on 30 November 1922 in Edinburgh, the son of University of Edinburgh-educated schoolmaster Harry Graham Crowden (d. 1938) and Anne Margaret (née Paterson). He was educated at Clifton Hall School and the Edinburgh Academy before serving briefly in the Royal Scots Youth Battalion of the army until he was injured in an accident. During arms drill he was shot by his platoon sergeant, when the sergeant&#x27;s rifle discharged. The sergeant reportedly enquired &quot;What is it now, Crowden?&quot;, to which Crowden replied &quot;I think you&#x27;ve shot me, sergeant.&quot;. He later found work in a tannery. His sister, Anne Crowden was a world renown prominent classical musician and founder of the Crowden Music School, which has rich history of many renown graduates, faculty, and history of board members in Berkeley, California.

==Acting career==
Crowden had a long theatrical career, most notably at Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre where he performed as The Player King in &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, a play by Tom Stoppard.

He occasionally played mad scientists in film, taking the role of Doctor Millar in the Mick Travis films of director Lindsay Anderson, &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973) and &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982) and also playing the sinister Doctor Smiles in the film of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s first Jerry Cornelius novel, &quot;The Final Programme&quot; (1973). He also played the eccentric history master in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;if...&quot; (1968). In 1970, he appeared in the popular Thames Television series &quot;Callan&quot; as The Groper, a de-registered doctor, who had been in Wormwood Scrubs called on by Callan, when unofficial medical assistance was required (e.g. Series 3, &quot;A Village Called G&quot; and probably others between 1967 and 1973 though some are now lost).

In 1975, he made an appearance in &quot;No Way Out&quot; an episode of the British sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; alongside Ronnie Barker, Brian Wilde, Richard Beckinsale and Fulton Mackay, as the prison doctor when Fletcher was complaining of an injured leg.

He was offered the role of the Fourth Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1974, when Jon Pertwee left the role but turned it down, informing producer Barry Letts that he was not prepared to commit himself to the series for three years. Crowden&#x27;s potential hiring was the reason why Ian Marter was originally hired for a role, as the producers and directors considered Crowden too old to be seen running about and taking on a larger physical role. The role of the Doctor ultimately went to Tom Baker. Crowden appeared in &quot;The Horns of Nimon&quot; (1979–80) as a villain opposite Baker.

A regular role was in the BBC comedy-drama &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; (1986–1988) as the alcoholic Dr Jock McCannon. In 1990, he appeared as a lecherous peer in the BBC comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up&quot; and in 1991 he played a modest role in the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; episode &quot;Rumpole and the Quacks&quot;, playing Sir Hector MacAuliffe, the head of a medical inquest into the potential sexual misconduct on the part of Ghulam Rahmat (played by Saeed Jaffrey).

In 1990, he landed the role of Tom Ballard in the sitcom &quot;Waiting for God&quot;, opposite Stephanie Cole&#x27;s character Diana Trent, as the two rebellious retirement home residents. The show ran for five years and was a major success. In 1994, Crowden played the part of Professor Pollux in the BBC TV adaptation of the John Hadfield novel &quot;Love on a Branch Line&quot;. Crowden then voiced the role of Mustrum Ridcully in the 1997 animated Cosgrove Hall production of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Soul Music&quot;.

In 2001, he guest-starred in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode &quot;Ring Out Your Dead&quot; and also played The Marquis of Auld Reekie in &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot;. Between 2001 and 2002, he played a role in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;The Leopard in Autumn&quot;. In 2003, he made a cameo as a sadistic naval school teacher in &quot;The Lost Prince&quot;. In 2005–2008, he starred in the Radio 4 sci-fi comedy &quot;Nebulous&quot; as Sir Ronald Rolands. In 2008, he appeared as a guest star in &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;.

==Death==
For many years in later life, Crowden lived in Mill Hill, London. Crowden died on 19 October 2010 in Edinburgh after a short illness, survived by his wife, Phyllida Hewat, whom he married in 1952, a son and three daughters, one of whom, Sarah Crowden, followed him into acting.

<doc id="982370" wikidata="Q4809034" url="?curid=982370" title="Assistant secretary of the Navy">
<text>Assistant Secretary of the Navy (ASN) is the title given to certain civilian senior officials in the United States Department of the Navy.

From 1861 to 1954, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy was the second-highest civilian office in the Department of the Navy (reporting to the United States Secretary of the Navy). That role has since been supplanted by the office of Under Secretary of the Navy and the office of Assistant Secretary of the Navy has been abolished. There have, however, been a number of offices bearing the phrase &quot;Assistant Secretary of the Navy&quot; in their title (see below for details).

At present, there are four Assistant Secretaries of the Navy, each of whom reports to and assists the Secretary of the Navy and the Under Secretary of the Navy:

* Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition)
* Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)
* Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller)
* Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy, Installations and Environment)
* The General Counsel of the Navy is equivalent in rank to the four Assistant Secretaries.

==History==
The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy was established in 1861, to provide a senior deputy to the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary was responsible for the Navy&#x27;s civilian personnel, as well as for administration of shore facilities (such as naval bases and shipyards). Gustavus Fox was the first to hold the post, serving throughout the Civil War. The office was disestablished in 1869, during Reconstruction, but was reestablished by Congress on July 11, 1890. James R. Soley was the first to be appointed to the newly reestablished position.

The Assistant Secretary was the Navy&#x27;s number-two civilian until 1940, when Congress established the position of Under Secretary of the Navy, who was given oversight of the Assistant Secretary&#x27;s activities. James V. Forrestal, later Secretary of Defense, was the first to serve as Under Secretary; he held the post until 1944, when he became Secretary of the Navy.

During the 20th century, the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary were divided among several officials. During the 1920s, for example, to reflect the increasing importance of naval aviation, Congress established the position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air.

The office of Assistant Secretary of the Navy was disestablished in 1954.

===Notable officeholders===
* U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1897 to 1898, during the William McKinley administration. His short tenure was due to resigning to organize and lead into combat the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry during the Spanish-American War. It is notable for his taking the initiative to order Admiral George Dewey to sail to Manila where he sank the Spanish Pacific Fleet at the very outset of the war.
* U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 until 1920, and helped to implement Navy policies during World War I.
* According to author Edward J. Renehan, Jr., no fewer than five members of the extended Roosevelt clan served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. who served from 1921 through 1924 under Harding and Coolidge, Theodore Douglas Robinson (the son of Corinne Roosevelt) who served from 1924 through 1929 under Coolidge, and finally Henry Latrobe Roosevelt, a descendant of Robert Fulton&#x27;s old friend &quot;Steamboat Nicholas&quot; Roosevelt, who served from 1933 through 1936 under FDR.
* Ralph Austin Bard was Assistant Secretary (1941–1944) and then Under Secretary (1944–1945) during World War II.
