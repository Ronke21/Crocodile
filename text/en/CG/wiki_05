<text>The Korean War Service Medal (KWSM, , ), also known as the Republic of Korea War Service Medal (ROKWSM), is a military award of South Korea which was first authorized in December 1950.

==History==

===6.25 Incident Participation Medal===
Originally and technically known as the &quot;6.25 Incident Participation Medal&quot; (Presidential decree #390; 6.25 stands for June 25, 1950, the date of the beginning of the North Korean invasion into South Korea.), the colored and enameled 5-pointed star version of the Korean War Service Medal was first authorized to South Korean troops who had participated in the initial counter-assaults against North Korean aggression in June 1950.

On September 15, 1951, President Syngman Rhee referred to and authorized the commander-chief of the United Nations Command to confer the award of the &quot;Korean War Medal&quot; and &quot;Korean War Ribbon&quot; (&quot;Korean War Service Medal&quot;), &quot;to the brave and valiant members of the United Nations Command who have been, and are now, combating the communist aggressor in Korea.&quot;

====Crossed bullets medal====
On April 14, 1954, the South Korean government authorized the change of the star medal design to the round &quot;Crossed Bullets&quot; design (Presidential decree #892) of the Korean War Service Medal. The Taeguk symbol is not worn on the center of the suspension ribbon of the original medal or the suspension ribbon of the crossed bullets medal. The Taeguk symbol is only on the center of the service ribbon.

==Criteria==
The South Korean government specifies the eligibility period and criteria. Only the South Korean-provided medal is approved by the US government to meet the US criteria for wear on military uniforms.

In order to wear the medal and ribbon personnel must have:
*served between the outbreak of hostilities, June 25, 1950, and the date the armistice was signed, July 27, 1953:
*been on permanent assignment or on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 non-consecutive days, and
*performed their duty within the territorial limits of Korea, in the waters immediately adjacent thereto or in aerial flight over Korea participating in actual combat operations or in support of combat operations.

===Order of precedence===
The order of precedence for non-US service medals and ribbons is determined by date of approval. The Republic of Korea War Service Medal (August 20, 1999) should be worn after the Kuwait Liberation Medal (March 16, 1995). For the majority of Korean War veterans, the medal will be worn after the United Nations Service Medal, or the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal if they served during that conflict.

==Foreign acceptance==

===Australia===
On April 6, 2017, the Korean War Service Medal was authorized for acceptance and approved for wear, by the Governor-General of Australia. This approval came after the efforts of the Australian Council of Korea Veterans Associations to get the South Korean government to extend a new offer for the government of Australia to accept. Veterans who meet the eligibility criteria may obtain the medals from private medal dealers.

===New Zealand===
On April 23, 2001, the Korean War Service Medal was authorized for distribution and wear by service members of the British Commonwealth forces including the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF).

===United States===

While a number of countries accepted the medal, at the time of the Korean War Service Medal&#x27;s presentation to UN troops the United States of America declined to award the medal to US soldiers. This was based on regulations of the time which curtailed the acceptance and wear of foreign decorations on US military uniforms; the US Congress changed the law on May 8, 1954. Although subsequently some veterans attempted to have the award accepted, the Korean War Service Medal faded into history after the war and was not heard of again until 1996. At that time the Army noted that it could find no record that the South Korean government ever offered the medal to the Department of Defense. This was technically true since the original offer was made to the United Nations Command. The Army took the position that unless the South Korean government resurrected their original offer, it was &quot;not in a position to officially recognize or approve acceptance of the medal.&quot; Although some photographs show the Korean War Service Medal displayed with a Taeguk on the suspension ribbon of the medal, this is not authorized and indicates that it is a photo of a reproduction medal.

On August 20, 1999, Francis M. Rush Jr., Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army authorized the Korean War Service Medal for distribution and wear by service members of the United States military. The task of issuing the medal was assigned to Randolph Air Force Base while the National Personnel Records Center was responsible for providing documentation to verify eligibility and updating military records to show receipt of the award.

On May 13, 2000, the South Korean government announced it would provide the medal at no cost to eligible Korean War veterans for the years 2000 to 2003 (50th anniversary of Korean War, 1950 to 1953). The two governments held 50th anniversary ceremonies during that time period. The U.S. Air Force was the designated agency to receive and designate the medals.

====50th anniversary medals====

<text>Beggars in Spain is a 1993 science fiction novel by American writer Nancy Kress. It was originally published as a novella with the same title in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; and as a limited edition paperback by Axolotl Press in 1991. Kress expanded it, adding three additional parts to the novel, and eventually two sequels, &quot;Beggars and Choosers&quot; (1994) and &quot;Beggars Ride&quot; (1996). It is held to be an important work, and is often hailed for its predictions of emerging technologies and society.

The original novella won the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. The novel was also nominated for both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award, but did not win.

==Plot introduction==

&quot;Beggars in Spain&quot; and its sequels take place in a future where genetic engineering has become a reality, and society and culture face the consequences of genetic modifications (genemods), particularly in the United States. The story revolves around the existence of the &quot;Sleepless&quot;: individuals genetically modified to not need sleep, who have greater potential for intelligence and accomplishment than ordinary humans, called &quot;Sleepers&quot;.

The world of &quot;Beggars in Spain&quot; is also powered by cold fusion, named &quot;Y-energy&quot; after its pioneer Kenzo Yagai. Yagai also founded &quot;Yagaiism&quot;, a moral worldview Kress based on objectivism, in which dignity is solely the product of what a person can achieve through his or her own efforts, and the contract is the basis of society. As a corollary, the weak and unproductive are not owed anything.

The novel&#x27;s title comes from its primary moral question, as presented by character Tony Indivino: what do productive and responsible members of society owe the &quot;beggars in Spain&quot;, the unproductive masses who have nothing to offer except need? This is underscored by the rift between the Sleepers and the Sleepless; the Sleepless are superior in mind and body, and easily capable of outperforming their normal cousins. All men are &quot;not&quot; created equal. Where, then, is the line between equality and excellence? How far should any superior minority hold themselves back for fear of engendering feelings of inadequacy in their inferiors?—especially if this minority is not hated and feared, but rather the elite? This question is explored, but not elaborated on by the novel.

Nancy Kress has explained that the book, and the trilogy generally, grapples with the conflicting principles of Ayn Rand on one hand and Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s picture of communist-like community on the other.

== Plot summary ==

===Book I (the original novella)===
Leisha Camden, born in 2008, is the twenty-first human being to have the genemod for sleeplessness. She is the daughter of one of Yagai&#x27;s most noted sponsors, financier Roger Camden, who felt he had wasted far too much of his life in sleep, and his wife Elizabeth Camden, an Englishwoman who wanted a normal child. Sleeplessness confers a number of secondary benefits—higher IQ and a sunnier disposition most notably, as well as 50% more productive time (vs the time the unmodified spend asleep); Sleepless not only don&#x27;t need sleep, they &quot;cannot&quot; sleep (though they can be knocked unconscious).

By the age of fifteen Leisha has become a part of the community of Sleepless, few though there are in the world; she, like all of them, is several grades ahead of her age; the oldest, Kevin Baker, has already become the most wealthy computer software designer since Bill Gates at the age of 16 (in 2020). The first she meets, Richard Keller, becomes her lover; the others become friends and confidants. Two, however, trouble her. One is Tony Indivino, whose mother had problems adjusting to his Sleepless ways and forced him to live as a &quot;Sleeper.&quot; Tony advocates a banding-together of all Sleepless in a sort of socio-economic fortress. He predicts that the Sleepers will soon begin to discriminate against Sleepless, and is quickly proved right: a Sleepless athlete is barred from the Olympics, for instance, because her 16-hour practice days are impossible for other competitors to compete with. Likewise some cities forbid Sleepless from running &quot;24-hour&quot; convenience stores. Tony is eventually jailed (for illegal actions on behalf of the Sleepless community), though not before attracting the attention of Jennifer Sharifi, the other person who makes Leisha nervous. The Sleepless daughter of a movie star and an Arab oil tycoon, Jennifer&#x27;s money purchases land in upstate New York (Cattaraugus County, specifically) to create a Sleepless-only community known as Sanctuary. Finally, Leisha faces rocky relations with her twin sister Alice. By sheer chance, Elizabeth conceived a natural daughter at the same time Leisha was implanted in vitro, resulting in fraternal twins, only one of whom is Sleepless. Alice is constantly in her sister&#x27;s shadow: &quot;Whatever was yours was yours, and whatever wasn&#x27;t yours was yours, too. That&#x27;s the way Daddy set it up. The way he hard-wired it into our genes.&quot;

When Leisha is approaching her bar exams at the age of 22, her father dies of old age. On the drive home from the funeral, Leisha&#x27;s surrogate mother Susan Melling (not only Roger Camden&#x27;s second wife, but the genetic researcher who devised Sleeplessness) reports some startling news. Bernie Kuhn, a Sleepless in Seattle, has died due to a road accident at the age of 17. Autopsy reveals every one of his organs is in pristine condition. Evidently Sleeplessness unlocks a heretofore-unknown cell regeneration system. The bottom line is that Sleepless will not physically age. Their estimated lifespan is totally unknown. They might be immortal.

Leisha passes her exams, but shortly thereafter she is informed by Richard that various acts of prejudice and violence against Sleepless have culminated in the murder of Tony Indivino by fellow inmates. The Sleepless have no choice but to retreat to Sanctuary. However, Leisha is sent out on one last errand of mercy: a Sleepless child, Stella Bevington, is being abused by her parents. Alice turns the tables by masterminding and almost singlehandedly carrying out the kidnapping, not only saving both Leisha and Stella but proving that even the most privileged and elite can be beggars too. Leisha is left with the revelation that trade is not linear, but rather an ecology, and that today&#x27;s beggar may be tomorrow&#x27;s savior.

===Book II (2051)===
The book opens on Jordan Watrous, Alice&#x27;s son (born 2025), an employee at a We-Sleep factory. The &quot;We-Sleep&quot; movement is an attempt by founder Calvin Hawke to rejuvenate working-class pride by buying and selling only products made by Sleepers; despite the fact that the products themselves are often shoddy and over-priced, revenues have been lucrative. He shepherds his aunt Leisha on a tour of the factory; afterwards she meets with Hawke to &quot;rail against stupidity;&quot; since America is founded on the premise that all men should be &quot;treated&quot; equally, encouraging class hatred will only lead to destruction.

Leisha then receives an unusual client at her law firm: a genetic researcher, Dr. Adam Walcott, who claims to have discovered a post-partum gene therapy to turn Sleepers into Sleepless. Unfortunately for him, his research has been stolen from the safe-deposit box in which he left it; even worse, his patents have already been filed ... In the name of Sanctuary, Incorporated. Thankfully, the research is incomplete, but evidently Sanctuary is concerned about keeping its edge. Leisha asks Susan Melling to attempt to complete it and determine its legitimacy.

Leisha also discovers that Sanctuary Council leader-for-life Jennifer Sharifi has decided to institute a loyalty oath, in which all Sleepless swear to place the needs of Sanctuary above their own. Jennifer has always been convinced of the need to protect her people from the Sleepers, but her husband, Richard Keller, has his own reservations about the paranoid atmosphere his children are being fostered in. He doesn&#x27;t think his wife is capable of murder, though ... Until Jennifer is indicted for the murder, via sabotage and destruction of his vehicle (a We-Sleep scooter), of Dr. Walcott&#x27;s primary research partner.

&quot;The People vs. Jennifer Fatima Sharifi&quot; is a circus. Though the sabotage was clearly performed by a Sleepless, a piece of jewelry that serves as Sanctuary&#x27;s equivalent of a garage-door opener was found on the scene, which no Sleepless would be sloppy enough to leave behind. Meanwhile, Leisha&#x27;s life is slowly unraveling: Sanctuary has voted in the oath of solidarity and, furthermore, voted to ban Leisha for life; her partner Kevin Baker chooses to take the oath and abandon her; Stella Bevington, the closest thing she has to a daughter, is considering the same; and Susan is dying of an incurable brain condition. Fortunately, Alice comes to save the day, knowing (evidently through twin ESP) that her sister needs her; Stella confesses that the pendant is hers, which was stolen from her at a party; and Susan discovers that Walcott&#x27;s research is a sham, completely infeasible. With that information, Leisha now knows who has orchestrated the entire campaign: Calvin Hawke. He stole the pendant from Stella at a house-warming party Alice threw; he propagated the research, which he knew to be false, hoping that Sanctuary would react as it did; and, for reasons that remain unspecified, he had Walcott&#x27;s assistant killed. The volume ends with Leisha on retreat with Susan and Alice, and Jennifer informing her children that she will keep them safe: Sanctuary is moving into space.

===Book III (2075)===
In the year of America&#x27;s tricentennial, all is placid. America has re-stratified itself into a three-tiered society. At the bottom are the &quot;Livers,&quot; an under-educated but well-fed 80% of the population who enjoy a life of leisure. Above them (or below them) are the &quot;donkeys,&quot; the genemod white-collar force who run the infrastructure and are elected into office by the Livers, earning votes via bread and circuses. Finally, the Sleepless are the source of just about all technological, genetic and scientific advances.

Two new faces swiftly turn the tables. One arrives at Leisha&#x27;s Susan Melling Foundation in New Mexico, a ten-year-old Liver named Drew Arlen. He is intent on enrolling in the Foundation, which (in Leisha&#x27;s words) &quot;asks beggars why they&#x27;re beggars and provides funding for those who want to be something else.&quot; Drew has charisma and a harmless nature, but runs afoul of Eric Bevington-Watrous, second son of Jordan and Stella; a fistfight between the two leaves Drew paralyzed from the waist down. Attending various private schools, Drew finds a flair for artistic expression, but consistently fails or flunks out of each of them; by nineteen he has becomes a delinquent. Eric forces him into an experimental therapy in which the pathways between the limbic system and the neocortex are strengthened, supposedly forcing the brain to cope with its more primitive, bestial nature. In Drew, the treatment backfires, and he gains access to a sort of genetic collective unconscious, which he perceives in visual terms (in the next book, in which Arlen is a first-person narrator, he constantly describes people, things, concepts and emotions as having shape, texture, color and so on). Drew learns to project these shapes in holographic form and becomes the Lucid Dreamer, a performance artist who places his viewers in a waking dream, the contents of which are determined by the holograms.

The other new face is born at Sanctuary Orbital: Miranda Serena Sharifi, the first of the &quot;Superbrights.&quot; Her genemods cause her brain to operate at three or four times the speed of a standard Sleepless, at the cost of muscle control (she and all the other Supers, including her brother Tony, twitch, jerk and vibrate with &quot;manic vitality&quot;). Within the first few years of Miri&#x27;s life, it becomes clear that she and all the other Supers think differently than do normal Sleepless; their thoughts take the form of &quot;strings,&quot; which are entire piles of data arranged in geometric shapes and involving analogy and cross-reference. Her growth is set against a Sanctuary becoming even more careful and even more suspicious of the earth-bound Sleeper haters. Five children have been conceived that, through regression to the mean, lack the dominant Sleeplessness gene, and Jennifer is obsessed with declaring Sanctuary independent of America. To that end, Sharifi Enterprises begins research into an airborne, instantly-fatal biological weapon which can be used as a deterrent.

===Book IV (2091)===
In 2080 the United States loses its exclusive patents on Y-energy, leading to a massive economic depression. In October 2091, a new sliding-scale tax package is proposed to take advantage of the huge revenues going to Sanctuary Inc. and all associated businesses, which are, after all, incorporated in America. (To be specific, Sanctuary Inc. will be taxed a staggering &quot;92%&quot; of total income.) With this in mind, Jennifer and the Sanctuary Council prepare to bid for their independence.

Miri starts the volume with a trauma: her beloved younger brother Tony receives neural injury in a playground accident. Regardless of the total damage to his person and faculties, he will doubtless need to sleep for at least a portion of the day. Miri flies into a rage when Jennifer reminds her of Sanctuary&#x27;s Yagaiist, community-first philosophy, and must be sedated; when she wakes, she is told that Tony has died of his injuries. Regardless, she and the other Supers band together for defense, recognizing that the Sleepless of Sanctuary have become so nervous of outsiders that even the Supers, created by the community and to serve it, constitute a threat due to their sheer alienness. Miri names the group &quot;the Beggars.&quot;

Miri&#x27;s thought-strings—indeed, the thought-strings of every Super—have had structural flaws from the beginning, gaps where information ought to go that they don&#x27;t have. Miri rectifies this gap when she is introduced to one of Drew Arlen&#x27;s Lucid Dreaming concerts; the ability to tap into their unconscious allows the Supers to make a number of technological, medical and conceptual breakthroughs, including allowing Miri to cure the twitching and stuttering. The Beggars decide to install defensive overrides throughout Sanctuary&#x27;s systems so that they can take over if necessary, discovering in the process the Sharifi Enterprises bioweapon. Packets of the organism have been secreted in several cities across the United States and it can be deployed at the touch of a button.

On 1 January 2092 Sanctuary declares independence from the United States of America. The Internal Revenue Service decides to wait until non-payment of taxes on January 15 and then seize the orbital as collateral, but before then Sanctuary demonstrates its bioweapon on a cattle-ranching space station purchased solely for the purpose (all human tenants were evicted prior to the demonstration). The stand-off is averted when Miri and the Beggars use their overrides to force Sanctuary to stand down. Jennifer refuses Miri&#x27;s offer to surrender in exchange for immunity to the rest of the Council, proving that &quot;all of Sanctuary&#x27;s political philosophy ... comes down to [Jennifer&#x27;s] personal needs.&quot;

The novel ends with Miri and the Superbrights moving to the Susan Melling Foundation complex in New Mexico, and Leisha deciding to act as the counsel for the defense in Jennifer Sharifi&#x27;s trial. There are, after all, no &quot;permanent&quot; beggars in Spain.

<doc id="974709" wikidata="Q5155847" url="?curid=974709" title="Comparison of baseball and cricket">
<text>Baseball and cricket are the best-known members of a family of related bat-and-ball games. Both have fields that are or more in diameter between their furthest endpoints, offensive players who can hit a thrown/&quot;bowled&quot; ball out of the field and run between safe areas to score runs (points) at the risk of being gotten out (forced off the field of play by the opposing team and thus left unable to score further runs during that play), and have a major game format lasting about 3 hours.

Despite their similarities, the two sports also have many differences in play and in strategy; for example, far more runs are scored in a cricket match compared to a baseball game. A comparison between baseball and cricket can be instructive to followers of either sport, since the differences help to highlight nuances particular to each game.

==Bat-and-ball games==
Bat-and-ball games, in general, are sports in which one team (the fielding team) has possession of the ball and delivers it to a member of the other team (the batting team), who tries to hit it. The two opposing teams take turns playing these two distinct roles, which are continuous during a specified interval.
* This contrasts with &quot;goal-oriented&quot; games, such as all forms of football, hockey, and basketball, in which possession of the ball or puck can change in an instant, and thus &quot;attackers&quot; and the &quot;defenders&quot; frequently reverse roles during the course of the game.

In both cricket and baseball, the players of one team attempt to score points known as &quot;runs&quot; by hitting a ball with a bat and running, while the members of the other team field the ball in an attempt to prevent scoring and to put batting players &quot;out&quot;.

* In both games, runs can either be scored by running between safe havens (around the bases in baseball and between the wickets in cricket), or by hitting the ball out of the field.
* Outs can be gotten either by fielders catching a batted ball, batters not hitting a ball thrown at the strike zone/wicket, or getting a batter/runner out as they are running between safe havens, often by getting the ball to the safe haven the runner is running towards before the runner gets there.

Once a certain number of batting players are out (different in the two sports), the teams swap roles. 
* This sequence of each team taking each role once is called an &quot;inning&quot; (plural &quot;innings&quot;) in baseball, while one team taking its turn to bat is called an &quot;innings&quot; (both singular and plural) in cricket. The single and plural usage in cricket is comparable to the baseball slang term for a single inning as the hitting team&#x27;s &quot;ups&quot;. 
** A baseball game consists of nine innings per team (each team having nine &quot;half innings&quot; to bat in, and nine half innings to field in), while a cricket match may have either one or two innings per team. 
** The team with the most runs wins after the team with fewer runs has completed all of its turns to bat.
***Each team may play one or more extra innings in the case of a tie. These innings may be full-length (as in baseball) or very shortened (as in the case of cricket&#x27;s Super Over).

How the safe havens and end of the innings work:
* In cricket, there are two safe havens, with each required to be occupied by one player from the batting team. The two players are batting partners, with one of them hitting the ball for any given delivery, and the two scoring one run for each time they swap safe havens; the partner who ends up at the &quot;striker&#x27;s end&quot; safe haven once the ball is dead becomes the hitter for the next delivery. Once one of the partners is out, that player can no longer participate for the remainder of the innings, and a new player from the batting team occupies the now-empty safe haven. 
** Within each safe haven is a wicket; the batsman can be out if the ball is delivered to him and hits the wicket, or if a fielder hits the wicket with the ball while the batsman is not grounded in the safe haven of the wicket.
** A team that doesn&#x27;t have the two players necessary to occupy the safe havens is said to be &quot;all out&quot; or &quot;bowled out&quot;, and thus its turn to bat ends.
**In limited overs cricket, another way a team&#x27;s turn to bat can end is when the fielding team has legally delivered the ball a maximum number of times to its opponent&#x27;s batters. In a Super Over tiebreaker, this number is 6.
* In baseball, there are four safe havens, and a batter must run to the first of the safe havens (first base) when he hits the ball into fair territory, to avoid being put out. Once a batter is running, he becomes a baserunner, whose goal is to make it around all the bases back to home plate. 
** A fielder with the ball can get a runner out by touching either a base (if the runner is forced to advance to it) or the runner, either before the runner reaches the base (if forced to advance), or while the runner is not touching a base.
** Three outs ends the half-inning.

Other present-day bat-and-ball games include softball, stickball, rounders (both English and Irish forms), stoolball, pesäpallo or Finnish baseball, punchball, kickball, and British baseball. 
* Earlier forms include The Massachusetts Game of baseball, which was similar to rounders, and Old Cat.

==Field==

* Both sports have fields with large outfields (though baseball&#x27;s distinction between infield and outfield is more naturally derived, being based on the separation of the base-running area of the field from the rest of the field). In cricket, the bowling, batting, and running may all take place on the cricket pitch, which is the area where the ball travels through as it is delivered before being hit by the batter, while in baseball, the running happens separately around the bases. 
* The baseball warning track and the boundary rope in cricket (which is generally pulled in a few feet away from the wall bounding the field of play from the spectators) serve similar purposes: to ensure outfielders don&#x27;t crash into the wall/fence while trying to get to the ball.

===Baseball===

Baseball is played in a quadrant of fair territory between foul lines, with most play only occurring from balls hit into the fair territory. 
* The official minimum distance from home plate to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction is , and the recommended distances are at least along the foul lines and in center field. 
* This produces a recommended fair territory field area just over . 
* Most Major League Baseball parks have fair territory areas in the range of .

===Cricket===

In contrast, Test and limited overs cricket is played on a field with no foul areas. 
* There is a minimum width of and length , giving a minimum area of , assuming an elliptical shape. 
* However the shape of a cricket ground is not fixed. Test grounds around the world are typically , an area of about , ranging up to or at a venue such as the MCG.

===Bowling/pitching distance===
The area from which the ball is thrown:
*In cricket, the &quot;pitch&quot; is a prepared rectangular area between two wickets. Its length is the distance between the wickets, . While its width is 12 feet or 3.66 metres in length, the width of the playing area on that pitch is distance between two return creases, which are 8 feet 8 inches or 2.44 metres apart. The popping creases at each end of the pitch, from which the bowler bowls and the batsman plays, are 4 feet or 1.22 metres in front of the wickets. The bowling, popping and return creases are defined by contrasting lines, generally white in color.
*In baseball, the pitcher must deliver from a rubber slab (typically referred to as &quot;the rubber&quot;) that lies atop a raised area of the infield called the &quot;pitcher&#x27;s mound&quot;. The front of the rubber is from the rear point of home plate (officially called &quot;home base&quot; and often simply &quot;home&quot;). Before the advent of the pitcher&#x27;s mound and the rubber, the pitcher threw from within a rectangular &quot;pitcher&#x27;s box&quot;. There was a large rectangular dirt area, between the pitcher&#x27;s box and the batting areas around home, which resembled the cricket pitch.

The release point of the ball and where it reaches the batter:
* The bowler at the moment of delivery must have part of the front foot behind the popping crease and be within the return crease. The rules do not prohibit delivery of the ball from behind the popping crease, and the ball may be released from well behind the crease. The ball must be &quot;bowled,&quot; not thrown. The batsmen &quot;take guard&quot; or &quot;block&quot; in front of the wicket, and they may choose to do so in front of or behind the popping crease. That nets to a typical distance of about between the delivery point and batsman.
* In baseball, the pitcher&#x27;s release point could be about depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends to stand back or &quot;deep&quot; in the batter&#x27;s box, to maximise his time to &quot;look the ball over&quot;, up to further from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. 
Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman, is similar in both sports. 
* However, the ball usually travels further in cricket as it normally bounces off the ground first, adding a significant vertical component to the total distance travelled. In addition, though the distance between batsman and bowler is 58 feet, the batsman&#x27;s wicket is from the batting crease, meaning the ball must travel in order to bowl the batsman.

==Equipment==

* Baseball players use thin, round bats and wear gloves to field (with the catcher wearing a special, more protective glove)
** Note that while baseball fielders&#x27; gloves do provide modest protection against impact, they are used primarily to extend reach and are generally not padded (except for the catcher&#x27;s glove). 
** The only required protective gear for baseball batters is an unsecured helmet (as required in major league baseball rule 1.16); many batters also use elbow, shin, ankle, or hand protectors, and most wear a cup (A.K.A. a box) and use batting gloves (similar to golf gloves) to aid grip.
* Cricketers use wide, flat bats and field barehanded (except for the wicket-keeper, who wears gloves and protective leg pads). 
** In cricket a batsman wears protective gear such as pads, gloves, thigh pads, helmet, a chest guard, an arm pad and a box (A.K.A. a cup).

Another difference between the two sports involves the condition and replacement of the ball as a match progresses. 
* In cricket, if a ball is hit into the stands, the spectators must return it to the field. Also, a ball that is scuffed or scratched will continue in use; a ball must be used for a minimum number of overs (currently 80 in Test cricket and 25 in One-Day-International cricket with a different ball being used from each end) before it can be replaced. If a ball is damaged, lost, or illegally modified, it is replaced by a &quot;used&quot; ball of similar condition to the old one. Finally, cricketers are allowed sparingly to modify the ball, though this is highly restricted. The ball may be polished (usually on a player&#x27;s uniform) without the use of an artificial substance, may be dried with a towel if it is wet, and may have mud removed from it under supervision; all other actions which alter the condition of the ball are illegal. 
* In Major League Baseball (MLB), a ball that is hit into the stands is never returned to play and spectators are free to keep any balls that come into their possession (although local tradition may provide for a ball to be thrown back, specifically in the case of home-run balls hit against the Chicago Cubs when playing at Wrigley Field).
** Moreover, baseballs are replaced on a regular interval during the course of a game. Major League Baseball requires the home team to supply the baseballs that will be used during that day&#x27;s games. MLB further require that the home team make available at least 90 new baseballs to the umpires prior to the start of the game. Generally, a baseball is replaced every time it either is hit by a batter or touches the ground. In a typical Major League Baseball game, baseballs are replaced every five pitches or so with a total game average of around 70 baseballs being used.
** Because baseball hitting is difficult, baseball rules prohibit the deliberate scratching or scuffing of a ball, or the application of any foreign substance that could conceivably affect the flight or visibility of a ball. 
*** Balls that are deliberately made more difficult to hit by applying foreign substances are often known as spitballs, regardless of the specific substance applied (such as Vaseline). Both spitballs and those that become scuffed or scratched through normal game play are immediately removed from play and never reused. The current rules regarding the condition of baseballs did not come into effect until 1920, after the death of Ray Chapman from being hit with a Carl Mays spitball. Before that point, the rules were similar to those still present in cricket. However, the new rules were not consistently enforced for several decades afterwards, and several pitchers (most notably Gaylord Perry) built careers around skirting these rules, doing such things as hiding nail files in their gloves or putting Vaseline on the underside of the peaks of their caps. In modern baseball, however, the prohibition against modifying the baseball in almost any way is strictly enforced and players found to be in violation of this rule are not only ejected from the game in which the infraction occurred, but are also subject to a suspension.
*** The only substance applied to a baseball is the Delaware River mud formula that umpires rub in before a game to remove the &quot;shine&quot; from the ball and improve its grip. The pitcher is also allowed to use rosin on his hands (via a rosin bag) to improve his grip, and to blow on his hands in cold weather.

==Gameplay==
* Theoretically, in baseball, a single pitcher can throw every pitch for his team, while in cricket, a single batsman (so long as they get their batting partner to consent to running at the end of every over) can face every delivery for his team. However, the opposite (a bowler bowling every ball/a baseball batter facing every pitch) isn&#x27;t possible.
* The distance between the two batsmen&#x27;s grounds, which are the areas the batsmen run between to score runs in cricket, is . In baseball, each base is from the next base, meaning one run is equivalent to running .

===Fielding team===
A significant difference between baseball and cricket is that in baseball, because the batting team&#x27;s players are forced to advance around the bases, the fielding team must make outs in order to prevent scoring. A batter who hits the ball into fair territory, which is the main part of the field, is obligated to run to the first base, and since players are obligated to abandon the base they are on to run to the next base whenever there is a player forced to run to their base, any player from the batting team who is on a base will eventually either reach home plate to score or be put out, unless the half inning ends sooner because three offensive players are put out. By contrast, cricket players are never forced by rule to run or try to score.

A significant difference between the fielding team in baseball and limited overs (one-day) cricket is that in one-day forms of cricket, the fielding team does not have to get anyone on the batting team out in order to switch sides or win the game, since a team&#x27;s turn to bat automatically ends after they receive a maximum number of legal deliveries (a baseball team must make three outs in each of the nine regulation innings, and can potentially play extra innings in the case of a tie, meaning they must make at least 27 outs to win). Because of this, cricket fielding teams can use strategies unavailable to baseball teams that involve focusing more on minimizing the number of runs they concede per delivery (known as lowering the batting team&#x27;s run rate) than on trying to get anyone out.

====Fielding====
* A ball that has touched the bat and been caught by a fielder without bouncing on the ground results in the batter being out; see Catch (baseball) and Catch (cricket). (A caveat to this in baseball is if the batter has either 0 or 1 strikes, caught &quot;foul tips&quot; only count as one strike [but if the batter has 2 strikes, a caught foul tip counts as an out].)
* Fielders try to stop the ball from leaving the field (since this generally nets the batting team more runs than running), and attempt to throw the ball to wherever the batting team&#x27;s players are running to prevent them from scoring runs and get them out.
** In baseball, a fielder with the ball in hand may tag a runner, and in some situations, the base the runner is forced to run towards, to get a runner out, while in cricket, a ball that has been touched by a fielder may be used to put down the wicket of a batsman&#x27;s ground if neither batsman is in it.
* Baseball fielders specialize to play in one position (with this being mentioned in their lineup card), whereas cricket fielders generally rotate through various positions in a game; some cricket fielders are especially known for fielding in certain positions (such as the slips) or areas of the field (infield, outfield, etc.) most of the time.

The main difference in fielding in the two sports is that even though a cricket ball is harder and heavier than a baseball, generally fielders in cricket are not permitted to use gloves (except in exceptional circumstances, and when approved by both umpires) or external leg guards. 
* The only fielders who wear protective gear are the wicket-keeper, who is allowed to wear padded gloves as well as leg guards and an abdominal protector or box; and fielders in potentially dangerous close-in positions such as silly point and short leg may wear leg protection underneath their clothing, boxes and helmets but are still not allowed any gloves.
* In baseball, catchers and first basemen normally wear mitts, which have no fingers and are specially designed for each respective position. The other fielders wear gloves with fingers. (Early baseball was also played bare-handed; gloves were adopted in the later 19th century.)
This means that the risk of hand injury due to the impact of the ball is far higher in cricket. Also, especially in Test cricket, it is common for several fielders to be stationed close to the bat (slips, short leg, silly point, and similar positions) since the likelihood and value of dismissing a batsman by a catch in a close fielding position is higher.

Importance of runs in both sports:

* Baseball games have far lower scores than cricket matches. The largest combined runs total in a single game in the history of Major League Baseball is 49, whereas first-class cricket matches, including Tests, have produced combined totals from all four innings of over 1000 runs.
* For a more direct comparison, matches in Twenty20 cricket, a form of limited overs cricket in which games last about the same time as a regulation baseball game, frequently produce combined run totals of 300 or more, with the all-time record being 489. Each run in a baseball game is roughly 75 times as important as a run in a Test cricket match (or 10–20 times the value of a cricketer scoring 4 or 6 runs off a single ball); therefore moments of poor pitching and individual fielding mistakes are much more costly. A baseball player who is a great hitter will start games regularly regardless of how good his fielding is, but a player who is merely an above average hitter, but who is not a competent fielder, may not play regularly, or may be used only in the designated hitter position in leagues that use it.
Baseball players often need to throw immediately after catching a struck or thrown ball (for example, the double play), while this is unnecessary in cricket as the ball is deemed &quot;dead&quot; when a dismissal takes place (An exception occurs when there is a free hit ball: catches do not get batsmen out in these scenarios, so fielders may have to attempt run outs after catching the ball). 
* Hence, fielders in cricket have a greater incentive to dive and take a catch because a run out is generally much harder to achieve than it is for a baseball batter-runner to be thrown out.

Left-handers and right-handers in fielding:

* The configuration of the baseball diamond effectively bars left-handers from the fielding positions that make throwing to first base a primary responsibility. Right-handers can throw to their left – i.e., toward first base – with much greater ease than can left-handers. So in practical terms, all second basemen, shortstops, and third basemen are right-handed. Left-handed catchers are also exceedingly rare; while the reasons appear to be primarily cultural, handling bunts up the third-base line and throws on plays at home pose particular obstacles to left-handed catchers.
** While most throws a first baseman must make go to the right, which a left-hander can generally accomplish with greater speed and fluency, this is a relatively small factor to the advantage of a left-handed first baseman. More important advantages are related to the position of a left-handed first baseman with respect to the base. 
*** First, a left-handed first baseman has an advantage over his right-handed counterpart when catching a pickoff throw from the pitcher—when a first baseman is in pickoff position, standing in front of the bag, the left-hander can catch the ball and make a tag without having to move his arm across his body. (See the picture in the &quot;Strategy over the course of the game&quot; section below for the standard pickoff position with a right-handed first baseman.) 
*** Second, because the first baseman starts most plays with his left leg closer to the base, the left-hander does not have to make a half-pivot to get into the correct position to stretch out for a throw. For these reasons, left-handed throwers are far more common at first base than in the general population of baseball players. 
* In contrast, cricket is fielded in the round: The handedness of the fielder in any given position is of far less consequence because catching is more important than throwing; also, the batsmen run in opposite directions, and both left-handed and right-handed throwers are in all parts of the field. Still, it is common for right-handers to field at point and cover, and for left-handers to field at mid-wicket (to a right-handed batsman). In each case, this gives the fielder a better aim at the bowler&#x27;s end stumps when the batsmen run, which is usually the preferred target as the non-striker will normally reach the opposite crease first (because batsmen normally back up).

Body contact between runner and fielder is frequent in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven to a large extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. 
* However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, if he thinks he can dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does &quot;not&quot; have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. 
** Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally &quot;throw out&quot; a runner by hitting him (or &quot;soaking&quot;/&quot;plugging&quot; him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket&#x27;s wickets). 
*** This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal &quot;bowling&quot; of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. &quot;All &#x27;round hands down&quot; kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.
* By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for &quot;tagging&quot; rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate.

Rules around &quot;fake fielding&quot;:
* In baseball, the pitcher can be penalized with a balk for not delivering the ball, which in some instances involves not throwing to a baseman when the pitcher made a motion to do so.
* In cricket, a fielder can be punished for fake fielding.
Fielders choosing which players they want to try to get out:
* In baseball, runners can often advance on a fielder&#x27;s choice, which is when the fielder prioritizes putting out other runners.
* In cricket, fielders have a choice in who to get out when both batsmen are out of their grounds; when this occurs, they can hit either wicket with the ball, with the batsman who is nearest to the end of the pitch which that wicket is in being runout.
How fielders behave near the field boundary, and how they deal with deliveries that get past the fielder behind the batter:

* In cricket, because the field boundary is treated the same as the area outside of the field, fielders must be careful not to touch the boundary as they are handling the ball, because it will be treated as if they had stepped out-of-bounds with the ball, resulting in 4 or 6 runs for the batting team. 
** The wicketkeeper must be especially careful not to let the bowled ball get past them, since with every ball being in play in cricket, a ball that gets past the batter and wicketkeeper (such as a wide) can go to the boundary and score 4 runs for the batting side.
* Fielders can let the ball bounce &quot;off the wall&quot; that acts as the outfield boundary in baseball before fielding it.
** In general, baseball catchers do not have to worry if a pitch gets past them while the bases are empty, because the batter can not run in such a situation; the exceptions are when the pitch that gets past them is the fourth ball or third strike.

=====Fielding positions=====
Fielding position naming scheme:
* Baseball&#x27;s fielding positions are fixed and based on places in the field or areas relative to home plate i.e. &quot;center field&quot; is a position in the center of the outfield.
* Cricket fielding positions are named in relation to the handedness of the batter, and there are significantly more positions (some of which aren&#x27;t filled, since there are only 9 fielders to cover the large area) with names that loosely follow a polar coordinate system (i.e. words in the name of the fielding position give clues as to what angle and how far away the fielder is relative to the batter).

====Bowling/pitching====
* The ball may be thrown within a given area to get a batter out if the batter fails to hit the ball (In baseball, the strike zone if the ball is unhit a maximum of 3 times, and in cricket, the wickets).
* Baseball pitchers may legally throw the ball such that it reaches the batter at any height (though it may be called a ball), but are more limited in whether they can make the ball bounce before it reaches the batter. Cricket bowlers may throw the ball so that it bounces on the ground before reaching the batter at any height, which can make the ball deviate sharply, but they may not throw the ball directly to the batter above waist height unless it bounces first. 
** A baseball batter who swings at an &quot;unfairly&quot; delivered ball can be out in most of the usual ways, whereas a cricket batter can&#x27;t get out in almost any way when swinging at a no-ball, though they can be against a wide.

The different ways of making the ball move unpredictably:
* Cricket bowlers, since they are not restricted to a small strike zone as their target, also use a wide variety of approaches which are not available to baseball pitchers. These involve varying the line and length of deliveries and using unpredictable movement caused by the ball bouncing on the pitch before it reaches the batsman. 
* Baseball pitchers, by contrast, must use changes in ball speed and movement (in cricket bowlers also vary ball speed) caused only by air friction and spin to deceive batters, as most pitches which come near touching the ground are ineffectively allowed to pass as balls.

The ways in which the ball&#x27;s design itself interacts with the movement:
* The raised undulating stitching on a baseball allows an accomplished pitcher to create a huge variety of motions in the air; even fastballs are thrown in such a way as to create certain kinds of movement. 
* The cricket ball also moves in the air, swinging both inward and outward and even in reverse when the shine comes off the ball; but it achieves its most pronounced movement on the bounce, with seamers (fast bowlers) landing the ball on the seam to create slight but unpredictable turn, and spinners using spin to create significant turn and bounce variation.

From where and how the ball is delivered:
* Furthermore, pitchers must begin their throw from a stationary position, while bowlers may run up to their delivery. (In the early days of baseball, the pitcher pitched from anywhere within a &quot;box&quot; and so had more flexibility as to where to stand when releasing the ball, before the 1880s.) 
* Baseball pitchers also throw from an elevated mound ( above the level of home plate), while cricket bowlers are at the same height as the batsman (because every 6 deliveries which end of the pitch is used for bowling and batting switches) and must bowl with an overarm (or roundarm, a style rarely seen today) rotation of the arm during which the arm must not straighten by more than 15 degrees. (This was also a restriction on pitchers in the early days of baseball, abolished in the 1880s; today, baseball pitchers use a variety of delivery motions discussed below.)

Speed of the ball:
* While both sports can and have exceeded pitch speeds that exceed 100 mph / 161 kmph, it is far more common to see such high speeds thrown more regularly in baseball. The fastest recorded cricket delivery is with baseball&#x27;s record quicker at . 
** It is the case, however, that baseball pitches near or at 100 mph are considerably more common than bowled balls of comparable velocity in cricket. The bowler in cricket is much more restricted with respect to how much he can straighten his arm in delivering the ball, and this is one very significant reason why baseball pitchers can deliver the ball faster with more frequency.

One main difference, however, is that the ball in cricket is harder and heavier in weight. 
* The legal weight for the ball in baseball is from 
* The ball in cricket must weigh between .


Categorization of bowlers and pitchers:
* Cricket&#x27;s bowlers are grouped into different categories based on their bowling style—pacemen, seamers, off-spinners (or finger-spinners), leg-spinners (or wrist-spinners)—though a bowler may fall into more than one category (pace and seam bowling, for instance, largely overlap). 
** The faster bowlers usually open the bowling, when the ball is at its hardest and smoothest. Spin bowlers generally bowl later, when the ball has begun to deteriorate and become rough.
* Baseball&#x27;s pitchers are classified primarily by their throwing hand (left or right, with left-handed pitchers often called &quot;southpaws&quot;) and their usual role in games. 
** A starting pitcher begins games, typically not more than one game in five, in a rotation with four teammates who are also starters who will start games in a sequential cycle, and usually pitch five or more innings. Starters rarely appear as substitutes in games started by others. 
** A relief pitcher enters games later, sometimes on short notice in crisis situations when there are runners on base or the opponent&#x27;s best hitters are due to bat, and usually pitches fewer innings in any given game. But relievers may be called upon to pitch in several games consecutively. Some relievers even specialise further strictly as closers brought in just to pitch the last inning of a game in which his team leads by a narrow margin. Perhaps the most specialised group of relievers is left-handed specialists—left-handed pitchers who pitch almost exclusively to left-handed batters (sometimes to switch hitters who are weaker batters right-handed). Such pitchers frequently faced only one batter in a given game before 2020, when Major League Baseball required that pitchers who enter a game must face at least three batters, or record the final out of a half-inning, before being replaced.
*** Pitchers are sometimes secondarily grouped according to pitching style, type of pitch most often used, or velocity. This is especially common when pitching technique is rare or unusual. 
For example, there are many different variations on how the pitch is delivered, including the conventional overhand in which the ball is thrown from the 12 o&#x27;clock position, 3/4 styles (with the arm moving towards the plate between 12 and 3 o&#x27;clock), as well as the less common sidearm (3 o&#x27;clock arm angle, compare roundarm bowling in cricket) and &#x27;submarine&#x27; (below 3 o&#x27;clock, compare underarm bowling in cricket) deliveries. The submarine pitch is rare, and a pitcher who throws in this way usually has a &#x27;submariner&#x27; attached to his name or description. Similarly, there are many kinds of pitches thrown, including the fastball, curve ball, slider, and knuckleball. Capable knuckleballers are extremely rare and are usually described by this skill first.

Matchups between left-handed batters and right-handed pitchers, or vice versa:
* For reasons that continue to spur debate, it is historically the case that most right-handed pitchers succeed at higher rates against right-handed hitters than against left-handers, and that most left-handed pitchers succeed at higher rates against left-handed hitters than right-handers.
* One substantial strategic element to baseball is to use this phenomenon as much as possible. Defenses try to force a match between pitcher and hitter by side, and offences attempt to mismatch them; both teams use substitutions at times to accomplish the desired outcome. One response to this phenomenon is that many hitters, among them a number of the finest and most powerful to play the game, such as Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, became adept as youngsters to hitting both left-handed and right-handed to prevent defences from using that advantage against them. Many professional clubs employ as many as two or three switch hitters so as to neutralise the advantage of side selection. However, only one switch pitcher has played in the major leagues in modern times. 
* A similar phenomenon in cricket is where the two opening batsmen are selected to be one left-hander and one right-hander, so as to make it difficult for the opposition to select a bowler who can specialize against either type of handedness. This can apply even to other batting partnerships.

The prevalence of balls thrown at the batter&#x27;s body:
* In addition, if a baseball batter is struck with a pitch, he is awarded first base; &quot;hitting&quot; the batter includes hitting loose parts of his uniform without hitting his body (baseball rules specify that a player&#x27;s person includes his uniform and equipment except for his bat). 
** Pitchers may throw close to the batters, and a &quot;brushback&quot; is often used as an intimidation tactic. Deliberately hitting a batter is fairly uncommon, however, chiefly because it is punished severely. If the umpire believes a batter was intentionally hit, the umpire has his discretion on a first offence to warn both benches that the pitcher for either team will be expelled from the game if there are any further hit batsmen (the one baseball term in which &quot;batsman&quot; is used). The warning—and the power to expel if it is contravened—is intended not only to protect batters but to avert fighting; being hit by a fastball is taken seriously by batters, and bench-clearing brawls occasionally result when one team decides the other is deliberately throwing at its batters.
** Amazingly, in the history of the major league game, only one player has ever been killed by a pitched ball striking him in the head (Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians in 1920). This occurred before the invention of the batting helmet and was the principal cause for introducing this piece of equipment into the game as well as replacing dirty balls and outlawing the spitball. Baseball batters wear helmets, but they are unsecured and lack the &quot;cage&quot; of cricket helmets since only one side of the head/face is exposed. Catchers typically wear a helmet with a cage or protective bars.
* In cricket, bowlers consider the right to hit a batsman as part of their armoury; indeed, one of the most common methods of dismissal (leg before wicket) requires the bowler to hit the batsman&#x27;s body rather than his bat. (However, to cause dismissal, the ball must be adjudged to be going onto hit the wicket, and therefore generally be relatively low, where batsmen are mostly protected by padding.) 
** A fast bowler will punctuate his overs with deliveries intended to bounce up toward the batsman&#x27;s head, either to induce a poor shot (which can be either defensive or attacking) which may result in the batsman being caught out, or to intimidate the batsman, making him less likely to play forward to the next few deliveries for fear of injury. These tactics have long been an accepted part of cricket.
** In the modern game, batsmen usually wear helmets and heavy padding, so that being struck by the ball only rarely results in significant injury—though it is nevertheless often painful, sometimes causing concussion or fractures (although it can also have fatal consequences: Phillip Hughes died after being struck in the head/neck area by a Sean Abbott bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match in 2014). 
** An equivalent to a batter being hit by a pitch in baseball, where the ball hits the batter without bouncing first, would be a beamer in cricket. These are rare and usually caused by the ball slipping out of the top of the bowler&#x27;s hand. The even rarer intentional beamer provokes strong reaction from batter and crowd alike. The umpire is authorised to take disciplinary action in such instances. The bowler is generally given a first warning, and is dismissed from the game if the offence is repeated. 
*** A notable such case was between Waqar Younis and Andrew Symonds: Younis was banned from bowling by umpire David Shepherd for delivering a beamer to Symonds in a match between Pakistan and Australia at the 2003 World Cup; it was the first of only two times it&#x27;s ever happened during an international match.

What height the ball may reach the batter at, and how this plays into the possible deliveries:
* In cricket, a no-ball is called if the ball reaches the batter above waist-height without first bouncing. 
* In baseball, there is no such limitation, so a pitcher could throw a sinker that is thrown towards above the batter&#x27;s waist height, with the batter believing and setting up to hit the ball as if it will legally reach him at that height, but then sinks below the waist height upon reaching the batter.

There is a major difference in the way in which different bowlers or pitchers contribute to a single game. 
* In baseball, a single pitcher starts the game, and makes every pitch until the manager replaces the tiring pitcher with a relief pitcher. Replaced pitchers cannot return to pitch again in the same game (unless they are shuttled to another position in the field and thus stay in the line-up, a move rarely seen in the major leagues), and a succession of pitchers may come into the game in sequence until it ends.
** Although moving a pitcher to a fielding position and returning him to pitch later in the game is legal in baseball, it is a rarely used and potentially risky strategy, as the pitcher may be unprepared to play another position.
* In cricket, two bowlers begin the game, with those not actively bowling spending time as fielders. Every player in the team, including the wicket-keeper but excluding the 12th man, is available to be used as a bowler. Bowlers alternate bowling overs of six balls each. A bowler will usually bowl for a &#x27;spell&#x27; of several (alternate) overs, and will generally bowl the entire spell from the same end of the pitch. A second bowler will bowl the overs missed by the first, from the other end of the pitch, for his own spell, with the two bowlers said to be &quot;bowling in tandem&quot;. After a bowler is taken off, he may be, and often is, asked to bowl another spell later in the same innings.

The terms &quot;bowling&quot; and &quot;pitching&quot;, as words, both denote underarm deliveries, as were once required in both games. The rules for delivery were also initially very similar. Once overhand deliveries were permitted in the respective sports, and pitchers were compelled to toe the pitching rubber instead of throwing from anywhere within the &quot;pitcher&#x27;s box&quot;, the actions of bowling and pitching diverged significantly.

Penalties for bad or unfair delivery:
* The &quot;wide&quot; in cricket and the &quot;ball&quot; in baseball both derive from the concept of a &quot;fair&quot; delivery, i.e., a delivery that the batter or batsman has a fair chance of making contact with his bat. While there is no sharply defined &quot;strike zone&quot; in cricket as there is in baseball (but there are lines known as the return creases perpendicular to the other crease lines which the umpires can use as a guide, and in limited overs cricket specific wide lines are painted on the pitch 17 inches (43.2 cm) inside the return creases), in both cases the umpire must judge whether the ball was delivered fairly. Both the &quot;wide&quot; and the &quot;ball&quot; result in a &quot;penalty&quot;. 
** In cricket, like a no-ball, a single run is awarded to the batting team and it does not count as a legal delivery. However, a batsman may still be run out.
*** A no-ball is a delivery in which the bowler or the fielders violate the rules in other ways; it can often occur when the bowler bowls from too close to the batter. It is a delivery in which a batsman can&#x27;t be dismissed in any of the usual ways other than run out.
** In baseball, a ball is called, and if a pitcher gives up four balls the batter is awarded first base, which is called a &quot;base on balls&quot; or a &quot;walk&quot;. 
A walk will only score a run directly if the bases are already loaded, forcing the runner at third base to advance to home (known as &quot;walking in a run&quot;); otherwise the threat is merely of another runner reaching base instead of making an out. However, since runs are scored so much more frequently in cricket, the occasional wide, scoring a run directly, is not taken too seriously, although the extra delivery can be of vital significance toward the end of a match. In both games, a wide or a ball can be the decisive factor in winning a match or a game.

The number of pitchers/bowlers on a team:
* In limited overs cricket, teams are required to have at least five of their players bowl.
* In baseball, only one of the active players on a team has to be a pitcher, with the other players all being good batters and/or fielders. While allowed, it is quite rare for the pitcher to switch positions with another fielder in the way that occurs in cricket. However, because substitution is allowed, multiple pitchers may participate in a game without changing who the other fielders are, with each departing pitcher being permanently removed from the game,

The prevalence of batters occasionally doing some pitching, even when they are weak at it:
* Cricket batsmen are sometimes asked to bowl for short periods of time, as this can help rest the bowlers. In certain cases, a batter&#x27;s unorthodox style can flummox the opposition batters in a way that regular bowlers can&#x27;t.
* Except for blowout games where the likely-to-win team doesn&#x27;t want to have its pitchers get unnecessarily injured, &quot;position players&quot; (fielders) don&#x27;t pitch.

The way that each delivery has an impact in advancing the game:
* In baseball, every single pitch (with the exception of most foul balls with only one strike remaining) contributes to the batter either getting out or getting to first base, because every pitch is either put into play (in which case the batter can be forced out), or is adjudged as either a ball or strike (with 3 strikes getting the batter out).
* In cricket, only deliveries aimed at the wicket put the batsman at risk of being dismissed directly by the bowled ball, and only deliveries out of the batter&#x27;s reach (or that are otherwise illegally delivered) result in automatic runs for the batting team. Thus, it is possible for a ball to be bowled away from the wicket, but still within the striker&#x27;s reach, so that it does not contribute either to getting the batting players out or to the batting team scoring runs (for example, if the ball is not struck and the batsmen choose not to run.) The main impact of this type of delivery (dot ball) is that it reduces the number of deliveries left for the batting team to score off of (as there will either be a limited number of deliveries the batting team can face in their innings, or a time limit for the overall game, which doubles as a de facto limit on the number of deliveries in the overall game.)

===Batting team===
====Batting====

* The further the ball is hit away from any fielders, the more time for running and thus runs the batting team can score, or is likely to score in future plays.
* The ball may be hit out of the field to automatically score runs. (In baseball, a batter must run around all of the bases on a home run hit out of the park, but is under no risk of being out while doing so. In cricket, the batsman scores a six, which while not technically being the maximum number of runs scoreable off a single ball, is almost always so).
* Batters can play defensively to avoid getting out (&quot;fouling off&quot; pitches in baseball or the defensive strokes in cricket) while putting less of a focus on scoring, or can play more aggressively (&quot;power hitting&quot; or &quot;batting positively&quot; in cricket) to score runs more quickly while putting themselves at a higher risk of getting out.
* A cricket batter has significantly fewer restrictions than a baseball batter. They may swing and miss, or not swing, as many times as they like (so long as the ball isn&#x27;t going toward the wicket), don&#x27;t have to run if they hit the ball, may face as many deliveries (pitches) as they want to even after scoring runs (until they get out), and they have much more room between fielders to hit the ball to, given that there are no foul areas and the fielding team only has 2 more fielders to cover the significantly larger area of a cricket field than they would have in baseball.
** However, unlike a baseball batter who may have several at-bats (opportunities to bat) in an inning, a cricket batter can only bat once in an innings, with their opportunity to bat itself being called the &quot;batsman&#x27;s innings&quot;.

One of the main differences between baseball and Test cricket is the primary intent of the batsman. 
* Usually, in Test/First Class cricket, wickets come at a far higher premium, since survival is of primary importance. While nine innings per side are played in a baseball game within a few hours, only two per side are played in Test cricket over five days (thirty hours), so the cost of a dismissal is far higher in cricket. It should be kept in mind that a batsman in cricket is not obligated to take a run after striking the ball, nor is there any penalty for swinging at the ball and missing unless it hits the stumps (i.e., the wicket) (or, as often happens, makes a glancing contact with the bat and is caught) and there is no limit to the number of deliveries a batsman can face; a batsman with the required concentration, determination and technical ability often bats for several hours (occasionally days) without being dismissed. 
** Many of these characteristics are reversed in limited overs cricket, as batsmen have a limited number of legal deliveries to score from, and in the shortest formats of the game (such as T10 cricket), it may be possible to lose one wicket every couple of overs without the team becoming all out. 
* By contrast, in baseball a batter takes a serious penalty (a &quot;strike&quot;) if he swings and misses: three strikes result in an out, and if the batter hits the ball inside fair territory he must run.

Defensive technique and area for legal deliveries in cricket:
* This contrast means that in cricket, unlike baseball, the quality of a batsman&#x27;s defensive game and footwork are of the utmost importance. The nuances of batting technique are also greater in cricket, since the interplays between bowling variations, field placements and scoring strengths are more dynamic. Since cricket is played over an extended duration, the bowler and the fielding captain have time to &quot;work over&quot; a batsman (e.g., trying several different bowlers). Thus, cricket batting requires a very tight technique and the ability to withstand sustained examinations.
* The area for legal deliveries is much larger in cricket than it is in baseball, overlapping the batsman&#x27;s entire body. Deliveries that reach the batsmen at rib or shoulder height are legal, and quite common. Depending on the form of the game, more or fewer deliveries can be bowled to reach the batsmen at throat or head level. Any fear or hesitation can lead to a batsman playing a poor shot which may result in him giving away his wicket (being dismissed).

The amount of &quot;place hitting&quot; in both games:

* Since the cricket bat is wide and flat, while the baseball bat is narrow and round, on the whole cricket batsmen find it easier to hit and direct the ball than baseball batters, resulting in many more runs being scored in a cricket match. While bowlers can influence the ability of the batsmen to do so, perhaps the most famous episode being the Bodyline tactic, cricket batsmen can use a wider variety of batting strokes to direct the ball in many directions into a field which provides much more open space than in baseball. Keeping in mind, cricket batsmen are under no obligation to attempt to score a run after any stroke, but must strike balls to prevent them from hitting the wicket or their pads. Many strokes are in fact defensive in nature against a well-bowled ball and the quality of defensive batting is often the determining factor of a batsman&#x27;s success over his career, especially in the longer forms of the game.
* By contrast, the balance of power is largely reversed in baseball. While particularly skilled batters have some ability to &quot;place hit&quot; and direct the ball to desired locations, the pitcher&#x27;s influence is much more dramatic. Pitchers induce more ground outs, fly outs, or strikeouts, depending on the style of pitch. Thus particular pitchers are known for causing batters to make certain kinds of outs, depending on their mastered pitches. 
** Also in contrast to cricket, baseball batters must attempt to take first base on any ball put into fair territory, and failing to do so will result in an out, but the size of the strike zone more strictly limits the set of deliveries that must be swung at compared to cricket. 
** Like cricket, baseball batters do have a defensive tactic available; many batters will often attempt to deliberately &quot;foul off&quot; pitches that are strikes yet difficult to hit well, by hitting them into foul territory, awaiting an easier delivery later in the at-bat. Since an uncaught foul ball cannot be a third strike (unless it was a bunt attempt), this tactic allows the batter to receive more pitches.
***Because foul balls require runners to return to their bases, a foul ball on two strikes means that the game situation does not change whatsoever; this is in contrast to cricket, wherein the time/delivery limits in the game mean that legal deliveries that are not struck with the intent to score can hurt the batting team, as they are left with fewer deliveries in the remainder of the game to try to score off of.
** In the early generations of baseball, the emphasis was mostly on bat control, place hitting, bunting, etc. But, starting in 1919, several factors resulted in a dramatic expansion of strategic orientation, supplementing traditional &quot;small ball&quot; with the &quot;power game&quot;: a &quot;livelier&quot; ball, because of better materials and a tighter weave; more frequent substitutions of new balls; lighter, more flexible bats; the outlawing of the spitball; and the increase in attendance which drove owners to build more outfield seating, thus reducing the outfield area significantly. The power game has been encouraged further in recent years, by the construction of new ballparks with smaller outfields than previously, and even the reduction of field size at &quot;classic&quot; ballparks known for spacious outfields; for example, the distance to the fence in deep left field at the original Yankee Stadium was reduced from between 1984 and 1988 (the post-1988 dimensions were maintained at the current Yankee Stadium). Still, it is generally agreed that no one can hit a home run at will, and every successful batter knows never to go to the plate intending to hit a home run. Rather, he should attempt a level swing, try to pull only the ball on the inside of the plate, go the other way with balls low and outside, and otherwise start each at bat intending to drive the ball up the middle, which is the most vulnerable part of the infield (especially if the pitcher is not particularly good at fielding his position).

Which directions a batter may be incentivized to hit the ball in:
* In cricket, the boundary behind the striker&#x27;s wicket is generally a shorter distance away than the boundary in front of it. In addition, fewer fielders are generally positioned behind the wicket. So batsmen have some incentive to aim hits to behind their wicket. 
* In baseball, various game situations can dictate whether the ball should be hit to the left or right side of the field. For example, if the batting team has a runner on second base that they are intent on advancing, they will want to hit the ball to right field, as this gives the runner more time to advance to third base - positioned on the left side of the field - as the right fielder&#x27;s throw arrives.

The games emphasise power hitting to different degrees. 
* Cricket requires the accumulation of large numbers of runs; and placement of the ball between the fielders produces runs efficiently and is generally accepted as a better strategy than &quot;swinging for sixes&quot;. In cricket situations can arise in a match where power hitting, also called &quot;slogging&quot;, is required. This typically occurs towards the final overs of a limited overs game and can also be an option to get runs for batsmen even earlier in the innings. It is still quite risky.
** A batsman generally must hit the ball about or more to get it to the boundary. Whereas in baseball the batter needs to hit up to an excess of 450 feet (if center field) to get the ball outside the boundary. 
* In baseball, power hitting can produce runs quickly and frequently in many situations, as well as force pitching changes and other fielding moves; but it can also result (because of the great difficulty of driving a ball off a cylindrical bat) in a great many strike outs, fly outs, and ground outs.

Facing a delivery just outside the batter&#x27;s reach:
* In cricket, bowlers can bowl in the corridor of uncertainty, which is just a small distance away from the stumps. This forces the batter to consider swinging (to keep the ball away from his stumps) while putting him at risk of mishitting the ball and it flying behind him to the slip fielders for a catch.
* Pitchers can attempt to make a batter swing at a ball by making it seem like it will go in the strike zone, in which case the batter may have to make contact to foul off the ball in order to avoid a third strike, or hit into fair territory.

Batter&#x27;s ability to move around before and as they hit:
* In cricket, batters occasionally &quot;stand outside the crease&quot; (closer to the bowler) to counter the effects of swing or spin on the ball, though this can get them stumped.
* Baseball batters are restricted to staying in the batter&#x27;s box.
How the field boundary in each sport influences the way in which batters try to hit the ball out of the field:
* In cricket, the boundary is simply a line or relatively flat object (like a rope) that stretches around the field. Balls that touch the boundary in any way are considered to be outside of the field, and so batters can get significant scoring value on shots along the ground that can pierce a gap between fielders and reach the boundary.
* Baseball has an outfield fence which is considered to be within the field of play. This means the only way a hit ball can leave the field is for it to bounce or clear the fence in the air; thus, batters get less value from hitting the ball directly across the ground.
Whether a player who got out can participate further in the game:

* Cricket batters can not bat again for the rest of the innings once they&#x27;re out. This has significant strategic implications, as once the good batters on the team are out, the bowlers, who tend to score fewer runs, are the only players left to bat. 
*A baseball player, after getting out, can bat again one or more times in subsequent innings when it is his turn in the &quot;line-up&quot;, or even in the same inning, if all his teammates come to bat and the team has not made three outs and it is his turn again.

=====Running=====
* A runner may be out when not at a safe haven. This can occur when a fielder gets the ball to the safe haven the runner is running towards before they get there. (In cricket, this is through run outs. In baseball, forceouts are most similar to runouts). In baseball, other types of outs can be made against runners, such as tag outs.
** At most one runner can occupy a safe haven.
* Runners must coordinate to some degree, and must decide how much to run; running too much risks a runner getting out (particularly if a fielder is about to throw the ball to wherever they are running towards), but can also help them score more runs.

The safe havens:
* In baseball, the bases are the safe havens.
* In cricket, the popping creases and the area of the field between them are what separate the rest of the field into two separate safe havens, known as the batsmen&#x27;s grounds.

What counts as contact with the safe haven, for the purposes of making a player &quot;safe&quot;:
* In cricket, either the batsman or his bat (that he is holding) must touch the ground. 
** When sliding, batsmen almost always slide head-first into their ground with their bat outstretched in front of them.
** Practically speaking, the allowance of the use of the bat to be safe allows the nonstriker to more quickly be ready to face the next delivery if he becomes the striker after taking a single, and ensures the striker&#x27;s bat need not be moved out of the way or retrieved.
** Batsmen may leave their ground to avoid injury and remain safe. A 2017 modification to the Law also allowed a batsman who was safe to remain so if their bat or body went airborne, so long as they were trying to get into their ground.
* In baseball, only the runner&#x27;s body can be used to get on base; batters frequently drop the bat when setting off for first base, and can be called for interference if they carry it.
** Runners slide into base either head-first or feet-first.
** A runner is not safe at any point in which he is not in contact with the base. However, an exception is made for batter-runners who overrun first base.

How the ball is used to get a runner out:
* In cricket, the ball can be used to put down the wicket, with this being considered a discrete instance. In other words, if a batsman is in the ground of a wicket that has been put down, he is not out, and may leave that ground and continue to score runs, though the wicket may be remade and put down again.
* In baseball, if a fielder with the ball is tagging the runner, then the ball is &quot;live&quot; and the runner is out if at any moment he is not in contact with the base.
** The &quot;current&quot; rule of street cricket emulates this aspect of baseball.

How runs are scored through running:
* In cricket, two batters (one of whom is known as the nonstriker, akin to a baserunner) start out at opposing grounds, which are areas of the field behind lines drawn on the ground just in front of each wicket. Any time the two swap grounds, one run is scored. 
** There is no limit on the number of runs that can be scored off a single delivery in this way, so long as neither batter gets out. 
* Running counter-clockwise around the bases while making contact with each one with one&#x27;s body counts as a run in baseball. 
** A single player from the batting team can only score one run from each of their turns at bat by doing this.

When a player of the batting team is legally allowed to run in the attempt of scoring:
* In baseball, a batter must remain within the batter&#x27;s box, and may not advance around the bases on a live ball, unless they have either hit a fair ball, or the catcher has failed to cleanly catch the third strike of their at-bat. Runners may advance anytime during a live ball, even before the pitcher has pitched. 
* In cricket, the batsmen may run at any time after the ball in play has been bowled, regardless of whether or where to the ball was struck by one of them. The striking batsman may also bat out of his ground in a bid to shorten the distance they must run to score the first run, and the nonstriking batsman may begin running before the ball has been bowled.

Running plays a much larger role in baseball because of the low scoring; also, players on the batting team must run much further to score a run, because runners may remain in play (that is, on the bases) without scoring, and because baserunners can advance to the next base before the ball is hit again (&quot;steal&quot; the base) as soon as the ball is live. Base stealing often requires sliding, in which the runner throws himself to the ground to avoid being tagged or overrunning the base. The runner may also deliberately slide into the fielder at the base he is trying to steal to keep him from catching the ball or to disrupt a double play. At home plate the runner often will simply, and legally, run into a catcher who is blocking the baseline but who does not have the ball (a defensive player may not impede the runner unless he has the ball or is in the process of catching it).

The equivalent in cricket is almost impossible because the bowler is next to the non-striker, and in fact is able to mankad him if he strayed out of his crease (or simply cancel his runup, rendering the ball dead); in addition, it is legally considered unfair play for the batsmen to steal runs during the bowler&#x27;s runup. Tactical running in cricket rarely strays beyond the consideration of &quot;can I make it to the other end before the ball does&quot;. One exception of this is towards the end of a closely fought limited overs game, where a batsman (normally a tail-ender) would sacrifice his wicket to allow the better batsman to remain on strike, usually in the last few balls. While in baseball, steals, sacrificial running, forces, double plays, intimidation, and physical contact enter into the equation.

* Making contact with a fielder, as baserunners often do, would be unsportsmanlike in cricket, and unnecessary, as play stops when a single wicket is taken. 
* Occasionally a cricket runner will dive over the crease, but in baseball this is a regular occurrence, as players are frequently forced to run even when their chances are slim.

Since a team almost always scores fewer runs in a baseball game than its number of outs, a baserunner will frequently take risks attempting to advance an extra base or to score a run, resulting in close plays at a base. 
* In cricket, since the number of runs scored is much greater than the number of wickets taken in a match, a batsman would be very foolish to risk getting run out in an attempt to score an extra run without a very high expected chance of success. In general, cricket batsmen are run out due to exceptional fielding, poor judgment/communication, indecision, or a combination of said factors.
* In baseball, runners are often out not of their own accord – they are simply forced out.

In baseball, there is an ambiguity as to whether a tie goes to the runner or not; that is, if the fielding team executes an action meant to put the runner out at the same moment that the runner reaches a safe haven, is the runner out or not? 
* In cricket, ties do go to the batsman; both a run out and a stumping require that a batsman be &quot;out of his/her ground&quot;, meaning that a batsman who makes their ground at the same time that the wicket is put down will be safe.

===Umpiring===

In both sports, there is one umpire per safe haven, and additional umpire(s) to handle technology replays. In baseball, the umpire nearest the pitcher stands behind the batter, whereas in cricket they stand behind the bowler.

Cricket uses the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS for short), while there is Instant replay in Major League Baseball. One major difference is that, ignoring the umpires, DRS can only be invoked by players, while instant replay can only be invoked by the team managers.

===Game length===
A direct comparison is difficult since: 
* Cricket is predominantly played in three different formats: Test (and other first-class matches), One Day International (and other List A matches which last 50 overs, i.e. 300 legal deliveries, per innings) and Twenty20 matches (which last 20 overs, i.e. 120 legal deliveries, per innings). Of these, the Twenty20 format takes much the same time as a baseball game: around three to three-and-a-half hours. 
* Baseball games are generally much shorter than Test and One Day cricket games. Most Major League Baseball games last between two-and-a-half and four-and-a-half hours. 
** Because the Major League playing season is 6 months long (183 days, between April and October with spring training in February and March), with 81 games played at home and 81 away (162 in all, not counting the postseason or the All-Star Game), baseball teams often find themselves playing double-headers and series games. A doubleheader entails two games, played back to back, in one day. This usually occurs when a game needed to be rescheduled, and is a common occurrence at the beginning of the Major League season, which coincides with the rainy spring season. Although they were once common, double-headers are rarely scheduled any more by teams, but are part of the culture of baseball, with Ernie Banks&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s play two&quot; a famous refrain. A series occurs when two teams play on several consecutive days. This is a part of the regular schedule in baseball because of the number of games required in a season, and because there are large distances between stadiums in the US and Canada, thus conserving time and resources by allowing the teams to spend several days in a single location. In Major League Baseball there is a maximum of 20 days consecutively played before a break in games must be observed.

In cricket, test matches and certain domestic first class matches can last up to five days, with scheduled breaks each day for lunch and tea, giving three sessions of play each day. Full length games, for example between English counties or between Australian states, have a similar format to Test matches, but either three or four days are allowed. 
The &quot;limited overs&quot; versions of the sport usually last up to 7 hours. Twenty20 has innings of twenty overs per team and generally takes around 3 hours.

One Day Internationals and Twenty20 cricket, with their inherent limit on the number of fair deliveries, do not have an exact equivalent in baseball. The closest comparison would be games that have a pre-set number of innings shorter than the standard 9 (as with the second game of a doubleheader at some levels) or a pre-set time limit of some kind, such as a curfew restriction, or in the case of one of baseball&#x27;s cousins, recreational softball, a pre-set length of the game, such as one hour. In winter ball Caribbean leagues (and the MLB during the coronavirus) doubleheaders are commonly pre-set to last 7 innings instead of 9, except if they are necessary as tiebreakers; 100-ball cricket can be thought of as a similar shortening relative to T20 cricket&#x27;s game length.

====Result====

In both sports, when one team has completed all of their turns at bat, this entitles the other team (if they are currently batting) to automatically win at the moment that their score total surpasses the initial team&#x27;s total. (This is known as the winning team having chased down their &quot;target&quot; number of runs in cricket, and as the winning team having achieved a walk-off in baseball.)

The possibility of a result:
* Cricket:
** In Test cricket, it is possible neither team wins or ties; this is known as a draw. 
*** The original form of Test cricket, Timeless Test cricket, prevented this so long as teams had the time to play to a result. 
*** In the entire history of Test cricket, there have only been two tied Tests, with there being no tiebreaker rule for multi-day cricket.
** In limited-overs cricket, if a Super Over is used with the provision that additional Super Overs will be played if the tie fails to be broken, then a result is guaranteed.
* In baseball, if teams are tied, then they play as many extra innings as necessary to get a result.

Ability to predict result before end of game:
* In all forms of cricket other than the Timeless Test, it is sometimes possible to predict the match result well before the end of the game during the final innings, simply because it is almost impossible for a team to score more than 6 runs off a delivery, without either significant fielding errors or illegal deliveries being bowled.
* Whereas in baseball, the lack of time or delivery limits means a batting team that still has outs remaining can always come back (though certain competitions limit this possibility by instituting run-ahead rules to terminate blowout games).

==Strategy==
A wide array of factors affect both games (from composition of the pitch or field soil to weather conditions, wind, and moisture) and numerous strategies in both games can be employed to exploit these factors. 
* Other than the bowler, cricket places very few restrictions on fielding placement, even for the wicket-keeper, and its variety of bowling styles, 360 degrees of open field, wide bowling area (target zone), and so on give scope for strategic play. Notable exceptions include the limit of two fielders in the leg side quadrant, introduced to prevent the use of Bodyline tactics, and limiting outfield players in the early stages of limited overs matches and the subsequent introduction of powerplays. 
* In baseball, there are very specific rules about the positions of the pitcher and the catcher at the start of each play. The positioning of the other seven fielders is as flexible as cricket, except that each one must start the play positioned in fair territory. The fielders are otherwise free to position themselves anywhere on the playing field, based on the game situation.

===Condition of the ball===
A major element of strategy in these sports is the condition of the ball. 
* Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, seam movement, off-spin, leg-spin and so on), the condition of the ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will often ask for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack is more likely to be successful, he will persist with the old ball, which is rougher and better grips the surface as well the bowler&#x27;s fingers. 
* In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in optimum condition.

Various factors affecting the movement of a cricket ball:
* The aerodynamics of swing in cricket are different from baseball. Once a particular hemisphere of the cricket ball is more rough or scratched than the other, the fielding team meticulously works to preserve the shine on the other half by rubbing it on their clothes or by applying saliva (no &quot;external&quot; substances can be applied to alter the condition of the ball). Bowlers can then utilise both the asymmetrical aerodynamics of the surface combined with the effects the seam can have through the air to cause the ball to swing (curve through the air). Moreover, the raised seam also causes movement off the pitch in cricket, which is a very important part of medium pace bowling.
* The old ball in cricket also tends to generate greater amounts of reverse swing, which is swing towards the polished side. This can be exploited by genuinely fast bowlers (usually, those who can bowl over ). Especially on pitches in the Indian subcontinent, which tend to have abrasive surfaces, bowlers might resort to bowling across the seam as early as the tenth over, so as to quickly scruff up the ball and generate reverse swing early on. Strategies that rely on early reverse swing also need the backup of effective spin bowlers to be able to exploit the roughed up ball.
* Due to these factors, a batsman in cricket needs to watch very carefully how the bowler grips the ball even during his run-up, as well as the type of revolutions on the ball as it approaches. Master spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, who were able to dramatically vary the trajectory, direction and extent of spin, frequently bowled deliveries with a scrambled seam to disguise the type of ball actually bowled.

===Batting first or last===
* In cricket, since the strategies are greatly influenced by factors such as soil characteristics of the pitch, condition of the ball, time of the day, weather and atmospheric conditions, the decision to bat first or last is of great tactical importance.
** The team that wins the coin toss has the choice of batting first or last. This choice can be crucial to success; particularly in Test cricket. As the pitch is used for up to five consecutive days with little maintenance, the deterioration of the pitch with wear can have a major influence on the result of the match (e.g., typically the ability of spin bowlers to &quot;turn&quot; the ball increases toward the end of a Test match, whereas fast bowlers often prefer a harder and bouncier pitch often found at the start of a match). It is usual for some amount of grass to be left on the pitch on the first day of a Test, since it helps bind the surface. The presence of grass on the pitch is conducive for pace bowling, so a grassy pitch may also tempt a captain to field first. Sometimes, weather conditions also influence the decision, since a cloud (especially overcast cloud) cover has been found to assist swing bowling. Aggressive captains such as Allan Border of Australia have been known to bat first in Test cricket regardless of the conditions.
** In One Day International cricket, the time of day is also a crucial factor in determining the captain&#x27;s decision at the toss. In some parts of the world, dew on the ground can be significant. In a day-night game, grounds in some countries like India or South Africa become wet due to dew, which makes it difficult for a spinner to grip the ball. The captain must balance this against a consideration for bowling becoming more effective under lights, since the ball might skid off any dew on the pitch or get assistance in swing from the cooler night-time air. Even for a day game, the captain might be inclined to exploit early morning dew on the pitch.
* In baseball, on the other hand, the &quot;home&quot; team always bats last. 
** At a &quot;neutral&quot; site, such as the College World Series, the &quot;home&quot; team may be decided by coin toss, but that &quot;home&quot; team must bat last.
** This was not originally the case. In the early years, the winner of a coin toss could decide whether to bat first or last. The more offence-oriented aspect of the early game might influence a team&#x27;s decision to bat first and hope to get a quick lead. This led to the occasional unfortunate situation where the home town crowd would have to watch their team lose a game in the last of the ninth inning, in &quot;sudden victory&quot; fashion by the visiting team. By the late 1800s, the rule was changed to compel the home team to bat last.

===Fielding strategy===
In cricket, since the batsmen can hit the ball with greater variation and different objectives, the field placements are more important and varied. 
* Modern-day coaches and captains have intricate knowledge of the strengths of opposition batsmen, so they try to plug the dominant scoring areas for each batsman. Moreover, since the bowling attack has greater variety in cricket, the field placements required for each type and line of attack also vary greatly.
* Depending on the scoring strengths of the batsman (off-side, leg-side, straight, square, front foot, back foot, power hitter, &quot;finds the gap&quot;, &quot;clears the field&quot; and so on), the captain must make adjustments to the field each time the batting pair score a run and change ends, which can possibly happen after every ball in an over. To meet the demands of a speedy over-rate (typically, about 15 overs an hour), the captain must arrange the fielders in a way that they can swiftly interchange positions for the two batsmen. This is especially important if one batsman is right-handed, while the other is left-handed. And also in limited overs cricket if the umpires deem the over rate of the team fielding first is too slow they can dock them overs so they may have less than 20/50 overs to reach their target score when it is their turn to bat.
* Fielders in cricket can field in all positions, but modern players have specialised field positions. 
** In particular, slip positions require special skills since the slip fielder is placed behind the batsman and the ball comes directly off the edge of the bat. 
** Close catching positions such as forward short leg and silly point, as well as positions for the cut shot such as gully and point, require very fast reflexes and canny anticipation, so they are also specialist positions. 
** Conversely outfielders also can be specialist positions due to the need for a strong throwing arm. (Often fast bowlers are well-suited for this.)

In baseball, although only the positions of pitcher and catcher are prescribed by the rules, fielders&#x27; positions are dictated closely by custom, and shifts in fielders&#x27; positions according to circumstance are less dramatic; the strike zone and smaller angle of fair territory limit the usefulness of some strategies which cricket makes available to batsmen. 
** The chief occasion on which fielding placement differs markedly from the usual is the presence of a &quot;pull&quot;, or &quot;dead-pull&quot;, hitter at bat (such hitters almost never, except on the rare occasion of a fluke or mishit, hit the ball in any direction except towards the same side of the field as they stand at the plate, i.e., a right-handed pull hitter hits everything toward left field). In such case the fielders will move so far in the direction of the pull that one half of the field is almost completely unprotected. This is called an infield shift or &quot;overshift&quot;. A six-man infield has also been used when circumstances warrant. 
** For the great majority of batters, however, the traditional fielding arrangement is used, with minor changes in position to accommodate the batter&#x27;s power or bat-handling ability, the location of runners, or the number of outs. (For example, with a base runner on third with less than two out, the importance of fielders being able to throw quickly to home plate on a bunt is increased, and the infielders will play closer to home plate.) 
However, baseball has no equivalent of cricket&#x27;s close-in fielders, because it is impractical to have fielders so close to the bat as they would have virtually no chance of latching onto a ball travelling so fast. It is possible to place a close-in fielder to catch a bunt, but this practice is almost never followed except in specialised circumstances such as a pitcher being forced to bat late in a game, with less than two outs and the opportunity to drive in a run. The team&#x27;s best chance to score in such a situation may be to sacrifice bunt and may warrant the first or third baseman playing halfway up the line to cut off the run at home.

===Use of signals, commands, and discussion===
====Coaching strategy and tactics====
* In cricket, coaches cannot intervene or direct gameplay; the captain must make all the calls once the players are out on the field. However, the coach may convey messages to the captain or the players at any time, since there is no restriction on signalling or speaking to players on the field. In dynamic situations, like a run chase with an imminent possibility of rain, it is quite common for coaches to update tactics using signals. Hansie Cronje, the former cricket captain of South Africa, once took the field with a wireless link to the coach, Bob Woolmer. Subsequently, the use of gadgets to transmit messages was banned by the International Cricket Council. Regardless, the coach is merely an adviser; it is almost always the case that the cricket captain has complete authority over the team once play starts. 
* In baseball, by contrast, managers and coaches will often direct the players (through hand signals) to carry out a play (such as a stolen base or hit and run), or to field at a particular depth. In fact, &quot;stealing signs&quot; can play an important part in baseball strategy when a player on an opposing team tries to interpret hand signals between pitcher and catcher or between runner and base coach, and possibly then relay this information to another player without being themselves detected.

====On-field players and captains====
* In cricket, the captain, bowler, and wicketkeeper may all confer over where to place fielders, and what type of ball to bowl. Non-active bowlers may offer advice to the current bowler. 
* The catcher has an outsized role in baseball, having to make many signals to the pitcher on what type of pitch to throw. Sign stealing is an issue. 
** The closest example of a wicketkeeper advising his bowler would be MS Dhoni advising Joginder Sharma in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final in the final over, and this was likely influenced by Dhoni being the captain.

===Strategy over the course of the game===

In both sports, strategy varies with the game situation. 
* In baseball, pitcher, batter, and fielders all play far differently in the late innings of a close game (e.g., waiting for walks, trying for stolen bases or the squeeze play to score a decisive run) than they do early, or when one team has already scored many more runs than the other (where batters will be likely to swing at many more pitches and try for extra-base hits and even home runs). 
** The number, speed, and position of baserunners, which have no equivalent in cricket, all dramatically change the strategies used by pitcher and batter. 
** A runner on first base must decide how large a lead to take off the base—the larger the lead, the greater the chance of advancing on a stolen base or batted ball, but also the greater the risk of being picked off by the pitcher. 
** In leagues which do not allow designated hitters, strategic thinking also enters into substitutions. For example, in the double switch, the substitution of a relief pitcher is combined with the substitution of a pinch hitter who takes the pitcher&#x27;s spot in the batting order so that the new pitcher will come to bat later (as almost all pitchers are poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). Since players may not return to the game after being substituted for, a manager cannot take lightly the decision when and if to substitute a better-fielding but worse-hitting player if his team is ahead.

Another difference between baseball and cricket strategy is the importance of sacrifice plays in baseball. These are plays in which a batter deliberately hits in a particular way or in a particular direction to advance runner(s) at the expense of himself getting out. 
* For example, a poor batter may deliberately bunt (hit a low slow ball) a ball towards first base so that he will be easily put out, to ensure that a runner on second base will end up safe on third. A stronger batter may deliberately hit a long &quot;sacrifice fly&quot; that he knows will be caught (resulting in an out) so that a runner can make it home to score a run. 
** This strategy results from the relative cheapness of individual outs in baseball and the relative importance of individual runs in baseball.
** In cricket, such a strategy would be foolish as runs cannot be scored when a wicket has fallen except in the case of a run-out (although if a batsman is caught and if he and the non-striker attempt a run and cross each other the new batsman must assume the non-striker&#x27;s position).

The essential action in baseball is either (for the offence) to advance runners around the bases or (for the defence) to halt that advance. 
* As simple as this is in principle, in practice it generates a remarkably large range of strategies. Any given situation—the number of runners on base, the bases they occupy, their skills as runners or base-stealers, the count on the hitter, the number of outs, the specialties of the pitcher and the batter, the catcher&#x27;s skill at throwing out runners, the positioning of fielders, which inning is being played, and so on—allows for a considerable variety of possible plays, on either side of the ball. 
* At any moment, one manager may be calculating how to advance his runners (whether to call for the steal, the hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, a double steal, the squeeze, and so on) while the opposing manager is calculating how best to thwart his opponent (not only through the pitching approach and positioning of fielders, but by, say, calling for a pitch-out when a steal is anticipated, and so on). 
** Since the variables that determine which strategies are possible or advisable change from pitch to pitch, and according to all the varieties of play situation that may come about in any game, the game played between the two managers is the most intricate aspect of the game, and for many followers of the sport is considered the true &#x27;inner game&#x27;.

Regarding the role of time in the result:
* First-class cricket also has a number of strategic elements not found in baseball, simply because the maximum time duration of the game is fixed (which can be up to five days for Test cricket) and a match not completed by the end of the time duration results in a draw regardless of the relative score (Although, in domestic competitions and the World Test Championship a 1st innings lead is beneficial to a team&#x27;s final standings).
* By contrast, baseball games are played to completion regardless of the time duration and there is no possibility for a tie or draw (with the exception of certain exhibition games such as the MLB All-Star Game, or in the case of Japan, where games are declared ties after 12 innings). There are no equivalents in baseball of, for example, deciding when to declare or whether or not to make your opponent follow on.

===Strategy based on the playing surface===
The condition of the playing strip (the pitch) in cricket is of vital significance as, unlike baseball, the ball more often than not is deliberately bounced on the pitch before reaching the batsman. While in baseball, playing conditions between different stadia are much the same (except for perhaps small differences in the dimensions of the field, whether the outfield is fast or slow, and if the field is grass or artificial turf), the physical characteristics of the cricket pitch can vary over the course of the game, or from one field to another, or from one part of the world to another. 
* On the Indian subcontinent, for instance, pitches tend to be dry, dusty, rough and soft which tends to wear down the ball more. These pitches offer less assistance to fast bowlers because the ball tends to bounce slower and lower, where most fast bowlers rely on bounce and speed to defeat the batsman. On the other hand, spin bowlers prefer this surface because it gives greater traction to the ball and will result in the ball breaking or turning more when it hits the surface. When such a delivery is bowled, the ball is said to have &quot;turned&quot;. 
* Conversely, pitches in places such as Australia, England, South Africa and the West Indies tend to be hard, true surfaces, called &quot;batting wickets&quot; or &quot;roads&quot; because the ball bounces uniformly and thus batsman find it easier to score runs, although these wickets suit fast bowlers more than spinners. 
* Accordingly, teams are generally much harder to beat in their own country, where both their batsmen and bowlers are presumably suited to the types of pitches encountered there. On any given pitch, however, conditions will become more suitable for spinners as time progresses as the pitch becomes softer and worn through use, making the spin bowler something of a cricketing &quot;closer&quot;. The pitch can be cleaned of debris and rolled between innings, and should be mowed before each day&#x27;s play at the discretion of the umpires. But the pitch cannot be watered once the match has started (unless it rains which can happen at a time when nobody can cover the pitch). Its characteristics can therefore change during the game, and can be a major factor in deciding whether to bat or field first.

Baseball parks are also not completely uniform, however many of the variations in playing conditions in baseball also arise in cricket. 
* Stadiums with retractable roofs, for example, usually play differently with and without the roof. For example, with the roof open the wind will affect how far the ball carries. 
* Against a running team the basepaths may be heavily watered. 
Many stadiums have idiosyncratic features – for example, the short right field and high left field wall (called the Green Monster) at Fenway Park, the former hill and flagpole in the outfield (Tal&#x27;s Hill) at Daikin Park, or numerous &quot;porches&quot; (parts of the grandstands hanging over the outfield, such as the &quot;Short Porch in Right&quot; at Yankee Stadium) which allow short home runs. There is an equivalent for this in cricket, where the placement of the pitch may render one perpendicular boundary significantly shorter than the other. For example, in a particular game, the leg-side boundary may be 15 feet closer to the batsman than the off-side boundary. Such a boundary can then be targeted by batmen in search of quick runs.

The baseball behaves differently in those stadiums with artificial turf as well. 
* Artificial surfaces are harder and more uniform than grass, and the ball tends to roll farther and straighter, and to bounce truer and more highly on these fields. Teams built to play the majority of their games on this field tend to place a higher premium on defence (since it is more likely to get an infield out) and speed (since it is more important to be able to beat out a throw) than on power hitting. 
* The altitude of the stadium (most notably Coors Field) can also impact the distance a batted ball travels and the amount of ball movement a pitcher can generate with his deliveries, although recently balls have begun being placed in humidors at high-altitude parks to negate these effects. 
* The amount of moisture in the dirt on the basepaths can also affect the behaviour of ground balls and the ease with which players may steal bases; some teams are known to alter the amount of watering done to the dirt depending on the skills of the home and visiting team. 
* The amount of foul territory is also an important variable, since foul pop-ups that would be outs in some parks (e.g., the Oakland Coliseum) may end up in the stands in other parks, thereby allowing the batter to remain at the plate (e.g., Fenway Park and Coors Field). 
On the whole, though, these variations do not produce effects as great as variations in cricket pitches, with one arguable exception being Coors Field.

In general, the condition of the pitch is a much greater factor in cricket than in baseball, while at the professional level stadium shape and quirks permanently built into the playing surface are greater factors in baseball than in cricket. Note that in amateur cricket pitches may have considerable variation in shape and may even incorporate obstacles (like tree roots), but this is not considered desirable or ideal. In baseball, familiarity with distinct field layout is considered to be an important part of having home-field advantage.

===Strategy based on batting order===
* The batting order in baseball must be declared before the game begins, and can only be changed if a substitution occurs. 
** Batting out of turn is a rule violation resulting in a penalty. When a manager makes a substitution, the new player must occupy the same place in the batting order as the old one. To allow more complicated changes in batting order, managers may use the double switch, substituting for two players simultaneously. This is typically used to replace the pitcher but put the new pitcher in a spot in the batting order that will not come up to bat soon, previously occupied by another fielder (pitchers are almost uniformly poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). However, the rule remains that no individual player can ever change his position in the batting order within the same game.
* Unlike baseball, the batting order in cricket is not fixed, and can be changed at any time, provided each player bats at most once per innings. 
** This gives rise to the &quot;pinch hitter&quot; in cricket– a non-specialist/lower order batsman promoted up the order to get quick runs– and the Nightwatchman. This latter is typically a lower-order batsman put in to bat near the end of the day to avoid a better batsman having to make two cold starts, a particular risk. In addition, there may be a &quot;finisher&quot; who is sent in near the end of the final innings in a one-day game to try to chase down a total.
** If a batsman is not ready to bat at the fall of a wicket, another batsman, typically the player who occupies the next spot in the batting order, will go out to bat in his place, to eliminate the risk of the original batsman being timed out.

The roles of individual players in the batting order are strikingly similar. 
* In both sports, the players near the top of the batting order are considered superior batters or batsmen. 
* The initial batters or batsmen generally specialise in avoiding making outs/losing their wicket, while the third through fifth batters and batsmen are considered their team&#x27;s best at providing runs. 
* After that, the talent generally drops off, with the pitchers and bowlers generally being the worst at batting. 
Sacrifice plays:
* Because outs are less important in baseball than in cricket, poorer batters are sometimes asked to attempt a &quot;sacrifice&quot; play in which they deliberately get themselves out in baseball to achieve a bigger team goal. 
* This only occasionally happens in cricket, at the end of a limited-overs game, when a poorer batsman may sacrifice himself so that his partner will be on-strike for the next delivery.

How the fielding team can negate the influence of a skilled batter:
* Also, since in baseball a batter who puts the ball in play does not get another at-bat until the entire batting order is cycled through, the opposing team may &quot;pitch around&quot; a skilled batter, deliberately walking him so that another batter comes to the plate. 
* In cricket, a batsman remains at the pitch until he is out, his team is all out, his captain declares or the set number of overs have been bowled, and the other team must bowl to him until he is out or one of the other above mentioned situations occur. The only way captains can negate the influence of superior batters similar to &quot;pitching around&quot; is to try to keep the more skilled batsman &quot;off-strike&quot;. This can be seen at the end of closely fought matches, where a captain might try to maximise the number of deliveries his bowlers can bowl at a non-specialist batsman. The exception is if the player is injured and has to leave the field for treatment: the next batsman in the order will then take his place. If the original batsman is able to continue later on, he can join the game again when one of his team&#x27;s batsmen is out provided his injury time has expired or after 5 wickets have fallen, whichever comes first provided the rest of the team is not bowled out before either of these situations arises.

==Evaluation and presentation==
===Scoreboard and scorekeeping===

Here are two examples of the scoreboard from one of the sports transferred to the other, to demonstrate what types of information both convey (the examples are designed for situations where there is greater ambiguity):

Notation: &quot;xxx&quot; means that a piece of information isn&#x27;t transferred to the other sport, while &quot;?&quot; indicates that a piece of information can&#x27;t be retrieved.
* Cricket to baseball:
** Cricket score (as would be seen on TV in a Test match): codice_1
** Baseball score (assuming one knows who the fielding team is): codice_2
** Notes: 
*** Many of cricket&#x27;s scoreboard stats only shown stats pertaining to the current innings, rather than previous innings; baseball stats tend to show performance across the whole game. 
**** Thus, the pitcher/bowler, Abbott, is known to have thrown at least 23 legal pitches in the current innings, which is derived as (3*6)+5. 
**** Baseball sometimes shows hits and at-bats, which in cricket would most closely correspond to the number of scoring shots and batsmen&#x27;s innings. Since 6 runs is almost always the most runs one can score from a delivery in cricket, it is possible to guess that Neil&#x27;s 20 runs were earned from at least 4 scoring shots (3 sixes and 2 more runs) or more.
*** Cricket scoreboards don&#x27;t always show the number of a batter in the batting order.
*** In a 2-innings cricket match, it is not always possible to know which team batted first or second, or even which inning it is; since NED was said to &quot;Trail by 7&quot;, this means that IND have batted exactly once (since if IND had not batted yet, then there would be no need to describe how many runs NED were ahead or behind of them, since NED would simply have a lead of however many runs they had scored so far, and if IND had batted the maximal number of times, which is two in this case, then NED would instead be described as &quot;chasing&quot; a &quot;target&quot; of however many runs they needed to score in their final inning to win, or &quot;needing&quot; 7 &quot;more&quot; runs to win); however, NED may have batted once or twice during the game.

** Cricket score: codice_4

===Statistics===

* Both games focus on batters, bowlers/pitchers, and fielders. Cricket emphasizes the number of balls (pitches) a batter has faced while batting, particularly in relation to the number of runs they scored, as well as how this relation varied over the course of their inning (at-bat). Baseball puts a heavier emphasis on the number of times a batter has gotten on-base and how many bases they advanced, as well as what type of hit got them there; the closest equivalent in cricket is measuring the number of balls a batter scored a certain number of runs from (with &quot;4s&quot; and &quot;6s&quot; being most common and showing how many balls a batter scored 4 or 6 runs from respectively, and &quot;Scoring Shots&quot; encapsulating all such balls.) Baseball stats are generally more comprehensive, though the advent of T20 cricket has led to more cricket stats being developed (similar to sabermetrics), and more in-game information collected.

Both games have a long history of using a vast array of statistics. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire. Every play or delivery is logged, and from the log, or scoresheet, is derived a summary report. 
* Baseball commonly uses times at bat, base hits, RBIs, stolen bases, errors, strikeouts and other occurrences. These are then often used to rate the player. 
* In cricket, commonly used individual player statistics for batsman include batting average, strike rate (mainly used in limited overs cricket), and number of 50 and 100 run scores made during an innings. For bowlers, bowling average, economy rate (most relevant to limited overs cricket), career wickets taken and number of five wicket hauls are commonly cited. Although cricket uses detailed statistics as a guide, owing to the variety of situations in cricket, they are not always considered a true reflection of the player. Ian Botham is an example of a player who, despite relatively poor averages, was particularly noted as one of England&#x27;s greatest cricketers for his ability to dominate games.

* Rather than evaluate innings pitched, cricket tends to look at how many runs a bowler concedes over a certain number of pitches, or how many runs they concede for every out they get. 
* Baseball maintains certain statistics for when a pitcher pitches an entire game without allowing runs, while cricket&#x27;s most similar such measurement is the number of maiden overs bowled.

Henry Chadwick (1824–1908) was an English-born American sportswriter, pioneer baseball statistician and historian, often called the &quot;father of baseball&quot;. Before he first came across organised baseball in 1856, he was a cricket reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and player of cricket and similar ball games such as rounders.

In baseball, questioning of the validity and utility of conventional baseball statistics has led to the creation of the field of sabermetrics, which assesses alternatives to conventional statistics. Conclusions are sometimes drawn from inadequate samples – for example, an assertion that a batter has done poorly against a specific pitcher, when they have only faced each other a handful of times, or that a player is &quot;clutch&quot; due to having more success with runners in scoring position or during the late innings with rather small sample sizes.

===Presentation and broadcast===
Both sports generally have broadcasts where the camera starts by looking towards the batter from behind the pitcher as the ball is delivered. 
* In cricket, the camera stays like this, but often quickly cuts to a view that is more zoomed out and focused on wherever the batter has hit the ball. 
* However, in baseball, the visual switches to a view that is high up and behind the batter when the ball is hit. 
* The two ways of portraying the action (one from in front of the batter, the other from behind) are reflected in the way that their field position diagrams are drawn, with both usually putting the &quot;viewer&quot;/camera (or where they can be thought of as &quot;looking from, but zoomed in&quot;) at the bottom of the diagram, and what is seen as &quot;further away&quot; at the top (see the diagrams in #Fielding strategy). 
** With baseball, one advantage of showing the fielding action from behind the batter is that &quot;Left/Right Field&quot; are to the left and right respectively of the camera&#x27;s view.

Both sports tend to use the lulls in the game which are common to bat-and-ball games (such as breaks between outs, or overs in cricket) to present statistics.

==Competitions==

Cricket:
* The twelve Test-playing nations regularly participate in tours of other nations to play usually both a Test and One Day International series. Twenty20 is becoming more popular in international competition. The amateur game has also been spread further afield by expatriates from the Test-playing nations. Many of these minor cricketing nations (including the US and Canada and other nations, such as the Netherlands, which do not have a British heritage) compete to qualify for the Cricket World Cup. The very first international cricket match was played between the US and Canada in 1844, and their rivalry till today is known as the KA Auty Cup.
** Cricket&#x27;s international programme allows the weaker cricketing nations to play against the best in the world, and the players have the chance to become national heroes. On the other hand, the dominance of national teams also means that a great many talented cricketers in nations such as Australia and India will never receive recognition or prestige unless they make it into the national team.
* India&#x27;s Indian Premier League, Australia&#x27;s Big Bash League and English T20 Blast are the most popular domestic T20 leagues, attracting huge crowds and popular players. Other countries with franchise based leagues include South Africa (SA20), West Indies (Caribbean Premier League), Bangladesh (Bangladesh Premier League), Pakistan (Pakistan Super League), Sri Lanka (Lankan Premier League) and Afghanistan.

Baseball:
* Baseball in a similar way has also been spread around the world, most notably in Central America and East Asia. Canadian baseball developed as a minor league sport in parallel to the US major leagues before eventually joining them. 
* Serious domestic leagues are found in many nations including Japan, South Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, and players routinely move across countries to join professional baseball teams. 
* However, baseball does not have a robust tradition of national teams or professional international competition, although this is slowly becoming more popular around the world with the emergence of competitions like the World Baseball Classic. 
* There have been several Australian Major League Baseball players, a country where cricket is more popular by far.
===International competitions===
* International cricket has three main formats, with one major tournament per format. The International Cricket Council has indicated a preference for the T20 World Cup to be the event for globalizing the game, while the longer-format tournaments will likely remain exclusive to the top 10 countries in the world.
* International baseball has dozens of countries compete in its tournaments (such as the World Baseball Classic and Premier12 created by the World Baseball Softball Confederation), with several countries winning trophies over the years.

===Domestic competitions===
Difference in domestic league structure:
* T20 leagues in cricket generally have 8 teams, and follow the Page–McIntyre system for the playoffs, with about 50 games total occurring over a month or two (Minor League Cricket is one significant exception). 
* Baseball domestic leagues have dozens of teams who are split into two &quot;leagues&quot; (akin to pools). Each team plays about 100 to 200 games over the course of about half a year, with the &quot;final&quot; being a series of 7 games (like the World Series and Nippon Series) to determine the winner of the top team in each league. 
The USA&#x27;s Minor League Cricket T20 event is more akin to the baseball structure, with &quot;regional conferences&quot;, but retains the single-match final common to cricket leagues.

==Sportsmanship==
Standards of sportsmanship differ. 
* In cricket, the standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase &quot;It&#x27;s just not cricket&quot; was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few decades though, top-level cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging, although players are still expected to abide by the umpires&#x27; rulings without argument, and for the most part they do. 
** Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been a spectacular save (though they may well be found out by the TV umpire anyway) and also signal if they did not take a catch even if it appeared that they did. 
** In addition, many cricket batsmen &quot;walk&quot; when they think they are out, even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is considered a very high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman might easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions; but with the introduction of the decision review system this has become more difficult (in games when the system is in use). 
** The &quot;Spirit of Cricket&quot; was added as a preamble to the Laws in 2000, declaring that &quot;Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game. Any action which is seen to abuse this Spirit causes injury to the game itself&quot;.
* Baseball:
** In baseball, a player correcting an umpire&#x27;s call to his own team&#x27;s detriment is unheard of, at least at the professional level. 
** Individual responsibility and vigilance are part of the game&#x27;s tradition. It is the umpire&#x27;s responsibility to make the right call, and matters of judgment are final. Similarly, when a runner misses a base or leaves too early on a caught fly ball, the umpire keeps silent, as it is the fielder&#x27;s responsibility to know where the runners are and to make an appeal. When a fielder pretends not to know where the ball is (the &quot;hidden ball trick&quot;), the umpire keeps silent, as it is the runner&#x27;s responsibility to know where the ball is.
** In baseball, celebrating an out, stealing bases when well ahead, or smiling on the field when well ahead are considered serious breaches of sportsmanship. Possibly the most serious breach of sportsmanship is the pitcher&#x27;s throwing behind the batter, since batters often react to a pitch that may hit them by backing up.

== History ==
=== Early history in the United States ===
The history of baseball&#x27;s formation and rise in popularity took place in the originally more cricket-supporting societies of England and America. Predecessors of baseball were brought to America during the colonial era by immigrants from England who played games similar to rounders; at the time, cricket was significantly more popular in the United States, since it was one of the primary sports played by Anglo-American colonists. At the time, the main format of cricket was first-class cricket, in which games lasted multiple days; baseball by comparison was a game that lasted less than two hours. Because of the vast difference in the duration of the two sports and for other reasons, such as Americans&#x27; desire to have some type of national game distinct from England&#x27;s games, baseball began to grow in America, especially among some of the non-English sections of society, such as among the Irish and German immigrants. Some attempts were made to nativize cricket in a way that would reduce its length and other perceived disadvantages relative to baseball; one example of this was wicket, an American variation of cricket which could be played in an afternoon, and which George Washington is known to have played with his troops during the Revolutionary War.

By the time of the Civil War, baseball had begun to overtake cricket in popularity; one reason for this was that troops during the Civil War preferred to play baseball, as it did not require a specialized playing surface like the cricket pitch. However, cricket had still been popular enough that President Abraham Lincoln had watched two American cities play each other in the sport in the years before the war. After the Civil War, baseball became a much more organized sport than cricket in America, with more money and competition available to baseball players across the country; thus, several professional cricket players switched to playing baseball, and cricket faded away in America.

=== Later history ===
In other countries that were part of the British Empire, cricket slowly emerged as the game of choice for the colonizers to spread their culture and values among the colonized. Some of the colonized people adapted to playing cricket in order to win the favor of the British, while in other cases, colonized peoples played cricket as a way of beating the British at their own sports, and thus proving themselves as equals. This helped to cement cricket as part of the national culture of several countries that later won their independence from the British.

In 2003, a new format of cricket called T20 cricket emerged which was designed to last only about three hours. By this time, the average MLB game had gone from being two hours long to about three hours long, so the two sports now had formats that were of a comparable duration. Later on, the T10 format of cricket, in which games last less than two hours, emerged at a domestic level, with leagues being started for it in several major cricket-playing countries.

=== Exchanges between the sports ===
Don Bradman was a famous cricket batsman who was known for his childhood drill of hitting a golf ball with a stump, which many consider to have significantly improved his hand-eye coordination. His batting average of 99.94 stands leagues above all other batsmen.

Babe Ruth is considered to be one of the best baseball batters. Babe Ruth and Don Bradman once met to discuss baseball and cricket, with Babe Ruth later trying out cricket in London, but saying he wouldn&#x27;t play it professionally as it didn&#x27;t pay well enough.

The South Korean national cricket team has received coaching from a former baseball player.

=== Popularity and cultural impact ===

Both sports play an important part in the cultures of the societies in which they are popular. 
* Baseball is deeply ingrained in the American psyche, and is known in the United States as &quot;the national pastime&quot;. It is one of the sports most readily identified with the United States. Baseball references abound in American English, and the sport is well represented in American cinema in numerous baseball movies. Baseball also plays an important cultural role in many parts of Latin America, (specifically Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Venezuela), as well as in East Asia. Many terms and expressions from the sport have entered the English lexicon. Examples are &quot;getting to first base,&quot; &quot;out of left field&quot;, &quot;having two strikes against him/her&quot;, &quot;swinging for the fences&quot;, &quot;he struck out&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s a home run&quot;, and &quot;southpaw&quot; (baseball diamonds are traditionally built with home plate to the west so hitters do not have to fight the setting sun as well as the pitch, a pitcher&#x27;s left arm is always to the south).
* Cricket has an equally strong influence on the culture of many nations, mainly Commonwealth nations, including England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe, the English-speaking Caribbean and especially in the Indian-subcontinent where it is often said to be followed like a religion. Canada has seen a marked increase in domestic, as well as interest in international cricket, over the past decade. This can be attributed, in large part, to the growing subcontinental diaspora in Canada. Cricket is the most popular sport or a major sport in most former British Colonies. Like baseball, cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations with such phrases as &quot;that&#x27;s not cricket&quot; (unfair), &quot;had a good innings&quot;, &quot;sticky wicket&quot;, &quot;hitting for six&quot;, &quot;played with a straight bat&quot; and &quot;bowled over&quot;.

==Informal versions of the games==

Both sports are often played in the streets or in other circumstances with modified/simpler rules, and with more makeshift equipment.

The basics that are retained are:

* Informal versions of cricket retain running between the wickets, as well as most forms of dismissals (except sometimes LBW) 
* Informal versions of baseball retain running around and being safe on bases, as well as some kind of foul area and strikeouts.

Both cricket and baseball have street versions that are passionately played in parts of the Americas, such as bete-ombro and plaquita for cricket or streetball and Vitilla for baseball. In addition, both have a variation where players kick the ball, rather than batting it: kickball and leg cricket.

<doc id="974713" wikidata="Q1195785" url="?curid=974713" title="Paul Arthurs">
<text>Paul Benjamin Arthurs (born 23 June 1965), known professionally as Bonehead, is an English musician. He is best known as the co-founder, rhythm guitarist, and occasional keyboardist and bassist of the rock band Oasis.

==Early life==
Arthurs was born in 1965 at Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Manchester, the son of Irish Catholic immigrants from Swinford, County Mayo and near Belfast. He went to St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Grammar School in the nearby town of Prestwich. He earned the nickname &quot;Bonehead&quot; at the age of eight after his parents insisted he get very short haircuts. &quot;It was only my mum and dad throughout my life, really, that called me Paul,&quot; Arthurs said. Arthurs left school in 1981 and worked as a plasterer. He started his first band, Pleasure and Pain, in 1984. Around this time, he began a relationship with his future wife Kate. In the late 1980s, while working as a building contractor, he started a band, the Rain, with his friends Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan, Tony McCarroll, and Chris Hutton. Unlike the Gallagher Brothers and McGuigan who are Manchester City supporters, Bonehead is a Manchester United fan.

==Career==
===Oasis ===
When Hutton was sacked, he was replaced by Liam Gallagher, who suggested the band change their name to Oasis. Liam and Arthurs teamed up as co-songwriters. However, the band were still unsuccessful until Liam encouraged his brother Noel, who had just come back from travelling the world as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, to join the band. Noel brought with him a collection of songs that were to make the band famous. Arthurs remembers the first songs Noel Gallagher played to him, &quot;Live Forever&quot; and &quot;All Around the World&quot;. Arthurs broke down and cried when Noel played &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; to the band on their tour bus. On the &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; DVD, he said his favourite Oasis song to play live was &quot;Columbia&quot;, as the song only consisted of three chords that create a hypnotic groove. 

When Oasis performed the song &quot;Whatever&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, they mimed and one of the cellists from the string section was replaced by Arthurs. Towards the end of the song, he started using the bow to conduct.

Arthurs is a multi-instrumentalist, credited as having played piano and Mellotron on &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; and can be seen on piano in the video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;, as well as pictures featured in the &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; album booklet. Arthurs briefly shifted to bass guitar after Scott McLeod — who replaced McGuigan before he was convinced to rejoin — quit in the middle of Oasis&#x27; 1995 U.S. tour; he appeared with the band on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; playing bass.

Arthurs was originally supposed to sing lead vocals on &quot;Bonehead&#x27;s Bank Holiday&quot;, a bonus track named after him and included in the vinyl version of &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; After he and Liam Gallagher got intoxicated on the day of the recording, Noel Gallagher sang lead vocals instead. Backing vocals from both Arthurs and Liam can be heard on the track.

===Post-Oasis===
Arthurs left the band in 1999, during the recording of Oasis&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;. His official statement said he wanted to spend more time with his family (his first child, Lucy was born 23 January 1995 and his son, Jude Arthurs was born on 16 August 1997).

Arthurs was replaced by Gem Archer; the rest of the band downplayed the reaction to his departure, Noel Gallagher commenting &quot;it&#x27;s hardly Paul McCartney leaving The Beatles&quot; though he also said &quot;We&#x27;ve got to respect their (Bonehead and Guigsy&#x27;s) decision as family men.&quot; Gallagher has said on several occasions he holds no malice toward the former rhythm guitarist and admiring him for the effort he put forth. In 2016, Gallagher said Arthurs was &quot;the spirit of Oasis.&quot;

Arthurs now lives in Manchester where he has built a recording studio under his house and formed Moondog One (named after Johnny and the Moondogs, one of the Beatles&#x27; former titles before they rose to fame), which also included The Smiths&#x27; Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke prior to the latter&#x27;s death from cancer in 2023.

In 2004, Arthurs teamed up with Sek Loso to play rhythm guitar alongside Loso&#x27;s new English bandmates. The group toured Asia, Europe, and the US in search of a label deal.

In early 2007, Arthurs had a visible presence in the North West of England for the first time since leaving Oasis eight years previously. His support for Andy Rourke&#x27;s Versus Cancer fundraising concert saw the pair busking together in Manchester&#x27;s Cathedral Gardens to raise cancer awareness and to fund raise for Manchester&#x27;s Christie Hospital. On 30 March 2007, the Versus Cancer concert was held at Manchester&#x27;s MEN Arena. Arthurs played bass guitar (rather than the trademark rhythm guitar from his Oasis days) in a two-song set. He was in a band billed as &#x27;Electric Milk Band&#x27;, which also featured former members of Happy Mondays.

He has been playing DJ sets in clubs, most recently in London. His playlist features Oasis songs such as &quot;Live Forever&quot;, and collaborations between the Gallagher brothers and Death in Vegas and The Chemical Brothers.

He also presented a radio show on BBC Radio Manchester with Terry Christian, Natalie-eve and Michelle Hussey. The show is Manchester Music and has had fellow Manchester music artists as guests including members of Happy Mondays, The Smiths and The Charlatans.

In 2018, Arthurs was set to appear on the ITV show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. However, he suffered an injury during training, after crashing into a rink-side vending machine.

====One-off projects====
The group Parlour Flames, made up of Arthurs and Vinny Peculiar (Alan Wilkes), released an eponymous album in May 2013, Arthurs&#x27; first since leaving Oasis. Guest musicians on the project included percussionist Che Beresford and brass-player Bob Marsh from Badly Drawn Boy and Anna Zweck from Samson &amp; Delilah on flute and backing vocals.

Arthurs&#x27; followed his Parlour Flames project up with a new group called Phoneys &amp; the Freaks, started in 2014 with singer/songwriter Alex Lipinski. Their eponymous EP was released in May 2014 under Cherry Red Records; it included four tracks and was made available on vinyl and digital download.

====Liam Gallagher====
In 2013 and 2014, Arthurs performed with Liam Gallagher&#x27;s band Beady Eye filling in for Gem Archer, who suffered from a head injury. This led to Arthurs reuniting with Gallagher.

Arthurs also joined Liam Gallagher to play rhythm guitar on the song &quot;Bold&quot; and keyboard on &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; on Liam&#x27;s solo album &quot;As You Were&quot;. He joined the band on their debut performance at the O2 Ritz in Manchester, playing rhythm guitar on the Oasis track &quot;Be Here Now&quot;.

On 22 May 2018, Arthurs performed with Gallagher at the London Stadium as part of Gallagher&#x27;s support slot for The Rolling Stones.

On 18 August 2018, Arthurs along with his son Jude and Richard Ashcroft, joined Gallagher on stage to perform &quot;Live Forever&quot; at Gallagher&#x27;s gig at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

During November 2019, Arthurs joined Gallagher on stage to perform Oasis songs during Gallagher&#x27;s UK and Ireland &quot;Why Me, Why Not&quot; shows, usually amounting to 10 or 11 songs in a set. As of 2020, Arthurs continued to tour with the Liam Gallagher band, later joining Liam for a virtual reality concert on 5 December 2020 called &quot;Down by the River Thames&quot;.
From 27 to 29 August 2021, Arthurs joined Gallagher to perform his set headlining Reading &amp; Leeds Festivals, playing songs from Gallagher&#x27;s solo career, as well as Oasis songs.

Following a health scare, Arthurs bowed out of Liam&#x27;s 2022 and 2023 tours, but returned for his 2024 tour.

====Radio====

On 8 May 2023, Arthurs co-presented a one-off show for British radio station Radio X titled &quot;Bonehead&#x27;s Bank Holiday&quot;.

On 25 December 2023, Arthurs would return to Radio X to co-present a one-off Christmas special titled &quot;Bonehead&#x27;s Christmas Day&quot;.

== Personal life and health ==
On 26 April 2022, Arthurs announced a statement saying that he had been diagnosed with tonsil cancer and could not join Liam Gallagher on his tour in order to undergo treatment. On September 29, 2022, Arthurs announced that he has been declared cancer-free.

==Equipment==
Arthurs used the same 1982 Japanese-made Matsumoku Epiphone Riviera throughout his time as Oasis&#x27; rhythm guitarist. He still uses this guitar today. He has also been known to play piano as heard in the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; and &quot;The Masterplan&quot;, mellotron on &quot;Wonderwall&quot; along with playing electric piano at the 1994 MTV Most Wanted for the songs &quot;Live Forever&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot;.

<text>Stone is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England. It is located 2.5 miles east of Dartford. In 2011 the parish had a population of 10,778.

==History==
Iron Age pottery and artefacts have been found here proving it to be an ancient settlement site. The 13th-century parish church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin at Stone, was known as the &quot;Lantern of Kent&quot; from its beacon light known to all sailors on the river. It is one of Kent&#x27;s most dramatic churches and is renowned for its Gothic sculpture made by the masons who built Westminster Abbey. The Grade I listing entry narrates each spandrel is either identical or almost identical to those at Westminster Abbey and therefore also dates to 1260, it also describes the North Chapel built for Sir Richard Wiltshire&#x27;s death in 1527 

The parish (including Bean) was part of Axstane Hundred and later Dartford Rural District.

Stone Castle is located about a mile to the south of Greenhithe.

==Today==
Stone Castle is now the regional office of a large cement manufacturer. The cement works, which once stood here, have been demolished.

<doc id="974718" wikidata="Q415122" url="?curid=974718" title="Fexofenadine">
<text>Fexofenadine, sold under the brand name Allegra among others, is an antihistamine pharmaceutical drug used in the treatment of allergy symptoms, such as hay fever and urticaria.

Therapeutically, fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 blocker. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine because it is less able to pass the blood–brain barrier and cause sedation, compared to first-generation antihistamines.
It was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Fexofenadine has been manufactured in generic form since 2011. In 2022, it was the 257th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Fexofenadine is used for relief from physical symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for treatment of hives, including chronic urticaria. It does not cure, but rather prevents the aggravation of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and reduces the severity of the symptoms associated with those conditions, providing relief from repeated sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes or skin, and general body fatigue. In a 2018 review, fexofenadine, along with levocetirizine, desloratadine, and cetirizine, was cited to be a safe drug to use for individuals with inherited long QT syndrome.

=== Efficacy ===
For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, fexofenadine is similarly effective to cetirizine, but is associated with less drowsiness than cetirizine. Fexofenadine was also shown to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare to a significantly greater degree than loratadine or desloratadine, but was slightly less effective than levocetirizine.

Fexofenadine at doses above 120 mg a day does not appear to provide additional efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include headache, back and muscle pain, miosis or pinpoint pupils, nausea, drowsiness, and menstrual cramps. Anxiety and insomnia have also been rarely reported. The most common side effects demonstrated during clinical trials were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and otitis media for children ages 6 to 11 and fatigue for children ages 6 months to 5 years.

==Overdose==
The safety profile of fexofenadine is quite favorable, as no cardiovascular or sedative effects have been shown to occur even when taking 10 times the recommended dose. Research on humans ranges from a single 800-mg dose, to a twice-daily, 690-mg dose for a month, with no clinically significant adverse effects, when compared to a placebo. No deaths occurred in testing on mice, at 5000 mg/kg body weight, which is 110 times the maximum recommended dose for an adult human. If an overdose were to occur, supportive measures are recommended. Theoretically, an overdose could present as dizziness, dry mouth, and/or drowsiness, consistent with an exaggeration of the usual side effects. Hemodialysis does not appear to be an effective means of removing fexofenadine from the blood.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist. Blockage prevents the activation of the H1 receptors by histamine, preventing the symptoms associated with allergies from occurring. Fexofenadine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so is less likely to cause drowsiness in comparison to other antihistamines that readily cross that barrier (i.e., first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine). In general, fexofenadine takes about an hour to take effect, though this may be affected by the choice of dosage form and the presence of certain foods.

Fexofenadine also exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===
* Absorption: After oral application, maximum plasma concentrations are reached after 2–3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with a high-fat meal, as mean concentrations of fexofenadine in the bloodstream are seen to be reduced by 20–60% depending on the form of medication (tablet, ODT, or suspension).
* Distribution: Fexofenadine is 60–70% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin.
* Metabolism: Fexofenadine is a substrate of CYP3A4, but only about 5% is metabolized by the liver, indicating that hepatic metabolism is relatively minor in clearance from the body.
* Elimination: Most of the substance is eliminated unchanged via the feces (80%) and urine (11–12%).

== Interactions ==

Taking erythromycin or ketoconazole while taking fexofenadine does increase the plasma levels of fexofenadine, but this increase does not influence the QT interval. The reason for this effect is likely due to transport-related effects, specifically involving p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Both erythromycin and ketoconazole are inhibitors of p-gp, a transporter protein involved in preventing the intestinal absorption of fexofenadine. When p-gp is inhibited, fexofenadine may be better absorbed by the body, increasing its plasma concentration by more than intended.

Fexofenadine is not to be taken with apple, orange, or grapefruit juice because they could decrease absorption of the drug. Therefore, it should be taken with water. Grapefruit juice can significantly reduce the plasma concentration of fexofenadine.

Antacids containing aluminum or magnesium should not be taken within 15 minutes of fexofenadine, as they reduce its absorption by almost 50%. This is not thought to be due to a change in pH (in fact, absorption can actually &quot;increase&quot; under increasingly alkaline pH), but rather due to the formation of metal complexes with charged/polar moieties on fexofenadine. As suggested by Shehnaza &quot;et al&quot; (2014), various sites of the molecule are thought to be responsible for this interaction, including the piperidine nitrogen, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and both hydroxyl (-OH) groups.

==History==
The older antihistaminic agent terfenadine was found to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, fexofenadine. Fexofenadine was found to retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so terfenadine was replaced in the market by its metabolite. Fexofenadine was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of fexofenadine HCl, along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of US$1.87B in 2004 (with $1.49B coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis which enabled the growth of AMRI.

In January 2011, the FDA approved over-the-counter sales of fexofenadine in the United States, and Sanofi Aventis&#x27; version became available in March 2011. In December 2020, the MHRA reclassified fexofenadine from prescription only to allow general sales in the United Kingdom.

==Society and culture==
===Brand names===

<doc id="974723" wikidata="Q5401390" url="?curid=974723" title="Estimation of covariance matrices">
<text>In statistics, sometimes the covariance matrix of a multivariate random variable is not known but has to be estimated. Estimation of covariance matrices then deals with the question of how to approximate the actual covariance matrix on the basis of a sample from the multivariate distribution. Simple cases, where observations are complete, can be dealt with by using the sample covariance matrix. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) is an unbiased and efficient estimator of the covariance matrix if the space of covariance matrices is viewed as an extrinsic convex cone in R&quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot;; however, measured using the intrinsic geometry of positive-definite matrices, the SCM is a biased and inefficient estimator. In addition, if the random variable has a normal distribution, the sample covariance matrix has a Wishart distribution and a slightly differently scaled version of it is the maximum likelihood estimate. Cases involving missing data, heteroscedasticity, or autocorrelated residuals require deeper considerations. Another issue is the robustness to outliers, to which sample covariance matrices are highly sensitive.

Statistical analyses of multivariate data often involve exploratory studies of the way in which the variables change in relation to one another and this may be followed up by explicit statistical models involving the covariance matrix of the variables. Thus the estimation of covariance matrices directly from observational data plays two roles:
:* to provide initial estimates that can be used to study the inter-relationships;
:* to provide sample estimates that can be used for model checking.

Estimates of covariance matrices are required at the initial stages of principal component analysis and factor analysis, and are also involved in versions of regression analysis that treat the dependent variables in a data-set, jointly with the independent variable as the outcome of a random sample.

==Estimation in a general context==
Given a sample consisting of &quot;n&quot; independent observations &quot;x&quot;1..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional random vector &quot;X&quot; ∈ R&quot;p&quot;×1 (a &quot;p&quot;×1 column-vector), an unbiased estimator of the (&quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot;) covariance matrix

:formula_1

is the sample covariance matrix

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the &quot;i&quot;-th observation of the &quot;p&quot;-dimensional random vector, and the vector

:formula_4

is the sample mean.
This is true regardless of the distribution of the random variable &quot;X&quot;, provided of course that the theoretical means and covariances exist. The reason for the factor &quot;n&quot; − 1 rather than &quot;n&quot; is essentially the same as the reason for the same factor appearing in unbiased estimates of sample variances and sample covariances, which relates to the fact that the mean is not known and is replaced by the sample mean (see Bessel&#x27;s correction).

In cases where the distribution of the random variable &quot;X&quot; is known to be within a certain family of distributions, other estimates may be derived on the basis of that assumption. A well-known instance is when the random variable &quot;X&quot; is normally distributed: in this case the maximum likelihood estimator of the covariance matrix is slightly different from the unbiased estimate, and is given by

:formula_5

A derivation of this result is given below. Clearly, the difference between the unbiased estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator diminishes for large &quot;n&quot;.

In the general case, the unbiased estimate of the covariance matrix provides an acceptable estimate when the data vectors in the observed data set are all complete: that is they contain no missing elements. One approach to estimating the covariance matrix is to treat the estimation of each variance or pairwise covariance separately, and to use all the observations for which both variables have valid values. Assuming the missing data are missing at random this results in an estimate for the covariance matrix which is unbiased. However, for many applications this estimate may not be acceptable because the estimated covariance matrix is not guaranteed to be positive semi-definite. This could lead to estimated correlations having absolute values which are greater than one, and/or a non-invertible covariance matrix.

When estimating the cross-covariance of a pair of signals that are wide-sense stationary, missing samples do &quot;not&quot; need be random (e.g., sub-sampling by an arbitrary factor is valid).

==Maximum-likelihood estimation for the multivariate normal distribution==

A random vector &quot;X&quot; ∈ R&quot;p&quot; (a &quot;p&quot;×1 &quot;column vector&quot;) has a multivariate normal distribution with a nonsingular covariance matrix Σ precisely if Σ ∈ R&quot;p&quot; × &quot;p&quot; is a positive-definite matrix and the probability density function of &quot;X&quot; is

:formula_6

where &quot;μ&quot; ∈ R&quot;p&quot;×1 is the expected value of &quot;X&quot;. The covariance matrix Σ is the multidimensional analog of what in one dimension would be the variance, and

:formula_7

normalizes the density formula_8 so that it integrates to 1.

Suppose now that &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent and identically distributed samples from the distribution above. Based on the observed values &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of this sample, we wish to estimate Σ.

===First steps===

The likelihood function is:

: formula_9

It is fairly readily shown that the maximum-likelihood estimate of the mean vector &quot;μ&quot; is the &quot;sample mean&quot; vector:

:formula_10

See the section on estimation in the article on the normal distribution for details; the process here is similar.

Since the estimate formula_11 does not depend on Σ, we can just substitute it for &quot;μ&quot; in the likelihood function, getting

: formula_12

and then seek the value of Σ that maximizes the likelihood of the data (in practice it is easier to work with log formula_13).

===The trace of a 1 × 1 matrix===
Now we come to the first surprising step: regard the scalar formula_14 as the trace of a 1×1 matrix. This makes it possible to use the identity tr(&quot;AB&quot;) = tr(&quot;BA&quot;) whenever &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are matrices so shaped that both products exist. We get

:formula_15

where

:formula_16

formula_17 is sometimes called the scatter matrix, and is positive definite if there exists a subset of the data consisting of formula_18 affinely independent observations (which we will assume).

===Using the spectral theorem===

It follows from the spectral theorem of linear algebra that a positive-definite symmetric matrix &quot;S&quot; has a unique positive-definite symmetric square root &quot;S&quot;1/2. We can again use the &quot;cyclic property&quot; of the trace to write

:formula_19

Let &quot;B&quot; = &quot;S&quot;1/2 Σ −1 &quot;S&quot;1/2. Then the expression above becomes

:formula_20

The positive-definite matrix &quot;B&quot; can be diagonalized, and then the problem of finding the value of &quot;B&quot; that maximizes

:formula_21

Since the trace of a square matrix equals the sum of eigenvalues (&quot;trace and eigenvalues&quot;), the equation reduces to the problem of finding the eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;1, ..., &quot;λ&quot;&quot;p&quot; that maximize

:formula_22

This is just a calculus problem and we get &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;n&quot; for all &quot;i.&quot; Thus, assume &quot;Q&quot; is the matrix of eigen vectors, then

:formula_23

i.e., &quot;n&quot; times the &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot; identity matrix.

===Concluding steps===

Finally we get

:formula_24

i.e., the &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot; &quot;sample covariance matrix&quot;

:formula_25

is the maximum-likelihood estimator of the &quot;population covariance matrix&quot; Σ. At this point we are using a capital &quot;X&quot; rather than a lower-case &quot;x&quot; because we are thinking of it &quot;as an estimator rather than as an estimate&quot;, i.e., as something random whose probability distribution we could profit by knowing. The random matrix &quot;S&quot; can be shown to have a Wishart distribution with &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom. That is:

:formula_26

===Alternative derivation===

An alternative derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator can be performed via matrix calculus formulae (see also differential of a determinant and differential of the inverse matrix). It also verifies the aforementioned fact about the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean. Re-write the likelihood in the log form using the trace trick:

:formula_27

The differential of this log-likelihood is

:formula_28

It naturally breaks down into the part related to the estimation of the mean, and to the part related to the estimation of the variance. The first order condition for maximum, formula_29, is satisfied when the terms multiplying formula_30 and formula_31 are identically zero. Assuming (the maximum likelihood estimate of) formula_32 is non-singular, the first order condition for the estimate of the mean vector is

:formula_33

which leads to the maximum likelihood estimator

:formula_34

This lets us simplify

:formula_35

as defined above. Then the terms involving formula_31 in formula_37 can be combined as

:formula_38

The first order condition formula_29 will hold when the term in the square bracket is (matrix-valued) zero. Pre-multiplying the latter by formula_32 and dividing by formula_41 gives

:formula_42

which of course coincides with the canonical derivation given earlier.

Dwyer points out that decomposition into two terms such as appears above is &quot;unnecessary&quot; and derives the estimator in two lines of working. Note that it may be not trivial to show that such derived estimator is the unique global maximizer for likelihood function.
==Intrinsic covariance matrix estimation==

===Intrinsic expectation===

Given a sample of &quot;n&quot; independent observations &quot;x&quot;1..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional zero-mean Gaussian random variable &quot;X&quot; with covariance R, the maximum likelihood estimator of R is given by

:formula_43

The parameter formula_44 belongs to the set of positive-definite matrices, which is a Riemannian manifold, not a vector space, hence the usual vector-space notions of expectation, i.e. &quot;formula_45&quot;, and estimator bias must be generalized to manifolds to make sense of the problem of covariance matrix estimation. This can be done by defining the expectation of a manifold-valued estimator formula_46 with respect to the manifold-valued point formula_44 as

:formula_48

where

:formula_49
:formula_50

are the exponential map and inverse exponential map, respectively, &quot;exp&quot; and &quot;log&quot; denote the ordinary matrix exponential and matrix logarithm, and E[·] is the ordinary expectation operator defined on a vector space, in this case the tangent space of the manifold.

===Bias of the sample covariance matrix===

The intrinsic bias vector field of the SCM estimator formula_46 is defined to be

:formula_52

The intrinsic estimator bias is then given by formula_53.

For complex Gaussian random variables, this bias vector field can be shown to equal

:formula_54

where

:formula_55

and ψ(·) is the digamma function. The intrinsic bias of the sample covariance matrix equals

:formula_56

and the SCM is asymptotically unbiased as &quot;n&quot; → ∞.

Similarly, the intrinsic inefficiency of the sample covariance matrix depends upon the Riemannian curvature of the space of positive-definite matrices.

==Shrinkage estimation==

If the sample size &quot;n&quot; is small and the number of considered variables &quot;p&quot; is large, the above empirical estimators of covariance and correlation are very unstable. Specifically, it is possible to furnish estimators that improve considerably upon the maximum likelihood estimate in terms of mean squared error. Moreover, for &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; (the number of observations is less than the number of random variables) the empirical estimate of the covariance matrix becomes singular, i.e. it cannot be inverted to compute the precision matrix.

As an alternative, many methods have been suggested to improve the estimation of the covariance matrix. All of these approaches rely on the concept of shrinkage. This is implicit in Bayesian methods and in penalized maximum likelihood methods and explicit in the Stein-type shrinkage approach.

A simple version of a shrinkage estimator of the covariance matrix is represented by the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimator. One considers a convex combination of the empirical estimator (formula_57) with some suitable chosen target (formula_58), e.g., the diagonal matrix. Subsequently, the mixing parameter (formula_59) is selected to maximize the expected accuracy of the shrunken estimator. This can be done by cross-validation, or by using an analytic estimate of the shrinkage intensity. The resulting regularized estimator (formula_60) can be shown to outperform the maximum likelihood estimator for small samples. For large samples, the shrinkage intensity will reduce to zero, hence in this case the shrinkage estimator will be identical to the empirical estimator. Apart from increased efficiency the shrinkage estimate has the additional advantage that it is always positive definite and well conditioned.

Various shrinkage targets have been proposed:
# the identity matrix, scaled by the average sample variance;
# the single-index model;
# the constant-correlation model, where the sample variances are preserved, but all pairwise correlation coefficients are assumed to be equal to one another;
# the two-parameter matrix, where all variances are identical, and all covariances are identical to one another (although &quot;not&quot; identical to the variances);
# the diagonal matrix containing sample variances on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else;
# the identity matrix.

The shrinkage estimator can be generalized to a multi-target shrinkage estimator that utilizes several targets simultaneously. Software for computing a covariance shrinkage estimator is available in R (packages corpcor and ShrinkCovMat), in Python (scikit-learn library ), and in MATLAB.

<doc id="974724" wikidata="Q311964" url="?curid=974724" title="Damien Rice">
<text>Damien George Rice (born 7 December 1973) is an Irish musician, singer and songwriter. He began his career as a member of the 1990s rock group Juniper, who were signed to Polygram Records in 1997. The band enjoyed moderate success in Ireland with two released singles, &quot;The World is Dead&quot; and &quot;Weatherman.&quot; After leaving the band in 1998, Rice worked as a farmer in Tuscany and busked throughout Europe before returning to Ireland in 2001 and beginning a solo career. The rest of Juniper went on to perform under the name Bell X1.

In 2002, Rice released his debut album, &quot;O&quot;. It reached No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart, won the Shortlist Music Prize, and generated three top 30 singles in the UK. He released his second album, &quot;9&quot;, in 2006. After eight years of various collaborations, Rice released his third studio album, &quot;My Favourite Faded Fantasy&quot;, in 2014. He has contributed music to charitable projects such as Songs for Tibet, the Enough Project, and the Freedom Campaign.

==Early life==
Rice was born in Dublin on 7 December 1973, the son of George and Maureen Rice. He grew up in Celbridge, County Kildare where he attended Salesian College. He is the second cousin of Irish singer Stevie Mann and English composer David Arnold.

==Career==
===Juniper===
Rice formed the rock band Juniper along with Paul Noonan, Dominic Philips, David Geraghty and Brian Crosby in 1991. The band met whilst they were schoolmates in Celbridge. After touring throughout Ireland, they released their debut EP &quot;Manna&quot; in 1995. Based in Straffan, the band continued touring and signed a six-album record deal with PolyGram. Their recording projects generated the singles &quot;Weatherman&quot; and &quot;The World is Dead,&quot; which received favourable reviews. They also recorded a song named &quot;Tongue,&quot; which was later released on the Bell X1 album Music in Mouth. The song &quot;Volcano&quot; was also written with Juniper but not released. It was later released by both Bell X1, on the album &quot;Neither Am I&quot;, and on Rice&#x27;s debut album &quot;O&quot;.

After achieving some of his musical goals with Juniper, Rice became frustrated with the artistic compromises required by the record label, and he left the band in 1998. He moved to Italy, where he settled in Tuscany and took up farming for a time, then returned to Ireland before busking around Europe. He returned to Italy a second time and gave a demo recording to his second cousin, English composer David Arnold, who then provided him with a mobile recording studio.

===Solo career===

In 2001, Rice&#x27;s song &quot;The Blower&#x27;s Daughter&quot; made the top-40 chart. Over the next year, he continued to record his album with guitarist Mark Kelly, New York drummer Tom Osander aka Tomo, Paris pianist Jean Meunier, London producer David Arnold, County Meath vocalist Lisa Hannigan and cellist Vyvienne Long. Rice then embarked on a tour of Ireland with Hannigan, Tomo, Vyvienne, Mark and Dublin bassist Shane Fitzsimons.

In 2002, Rice&#x27;s debut album &quot;O&quot; was released in Ireland, the UK and the United States. The album peaked at No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart and remained on the chart for 97 weeks, selling 650,000 copies in the US. The album won the Shortlist Music Prize and the songs &quot;Cannonball&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot; became top 30 hits in the UK.

In 2005, Rice participated in the Freedom Campaign, the Burma Campaign UK, and the U.S. Campaign for Burma to free Burmese democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi. He campaigned for her release by writing the song &quot;Unplayed Piano,&quot; which he performed at the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo.

In 2006, Rice released his second album, &quot;9&quot;, which was recorded during the two previous years. 2007 was a year of touring, with Rice appearing at England&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival and the Rock Werchter festival in Belgium In 2008, he contributed the song &quot;Making Noise&quot; for the album &quot;Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace&quot; in support of the 14th Dalai Lama and Tibet.

In 2010, Rice contributed the song &quot;Lonely Soldier&quot; to the Enough Project and played at the Iceland Inspires concert held in Hljómskálagarðurinn near Reykjavík centrum. Records released in the UK, Europe and other countries were published by 14th Floor Records via Warner Music. In spring 2011, Rice featured on the debut album by French actress and singer Melanie Laurent. He appears on two tracks on her debut album &quot;En t&#x27;attendant&quot; while collaborating on a total of five tracks which feature on the album. In May 2013, Rice told the audience at the South Korea Seoul Jazz Festival 2013 that he was working on a new album.

On 4 September 2014, Rice&#x27;s official Twitter account announced his third album, &quot;My Favourite Faded Fantasy&quot;, to be released on 31 October. On his official website, the date given for the official release was 3 November 2014. The album, featuring the first single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Change You,&quot; was released worldwide on 10 November 2014 to critical acclaim from NPR&#x27;s Robin Hilton and the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In 2020, Rice covered Sia&#x27;s &quot;Chandelier,&quot; with his cover appearing on the &quot;Songs for Australia&quot; benefit album.

While performing in Valencia, Spain, in late July 2023, Rice found out that Sinéad O&#x27;Connor had died when the audience shouted it at him during the show. After taking a moment to process the news, Rice played &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; as a tribute to O&#x27;Connor.

<doc id="974726" wikidata="Q3048242" url="?curid=974726" title="Hurricane Iris">
<text>Hurricane Iris was a small, but powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction in Belize. Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle. It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the year, forming from a tropical wave on October 4 just southeast of Barbados. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 5 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October 9. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The hurricane caused severe damage—destroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling trees—in coastal towns south of Belize City.

Destruction was heaviest in Belize and totaled $250 million (2001 USD). Because Iris was compact, the damage was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35 villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000 people homeless, many receiving assistance from the government and the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24 people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500 homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.

==Meteorological history==

Toward the end of September 2001, a poorly-defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, through an area of hostile wind shear, which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough, to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. A few days later, the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, allowing for an upper-level ridge, or high-pressure area, to form over the tropical wave. The change provided a favorable environment for tropical development, and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave&#x27;s axis. As the tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection, and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery. Although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined, the system increased in organization enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00 UTC on October 4, located about southeast of Barbados. Operationally, however, Hurricane Hunters did not confirm the depression&#x27;s formation until nine hours later.

In its early stages, the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of St. Vincent and St. Lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24 hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression&#x27;s well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00 UTC on October 5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of , corresponding to a surface wind intensity of . Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Iris moved toward the west-northwest at approximately 15 knots. Its trajectory was influenced by a strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the tropical cyclone, which dominated the steering pattern. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.
Despite the storm&#x27;s intensification and well-organized satellite appearance, the circulation failed to become better defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October 6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of early on October 7, its intensity remained steady for about 24 hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October 7, the area of hurricane force winds associated with Iris extended only from its wide eye.

Early on October 8, after turning west-southwestward away from the Greater Antilles, Iris began strengthening again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear and the NHC predicted peak winds of before the storm would hit Belize. However, Iris instead began to rapidly intensify within the favorable conditions, going from in a 12-hour period on October 8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38 mbar (1.12 inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of . For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about , during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of just off Belize. At 02:00 UTC on October 9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize. Operationally, it was assessed as having made landfall with winds of , though for an unknown reason this was lowered in post-analysis.

Initially, Hurricane Iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October 9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the storm&#x27;s circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October 18, before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.

==Preparations==
Over a stretch of four days, sixteen tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, the Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. The threat from Iris prompted the Jamaica National Emergency Operations Center to be activated. Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.

In Belize, a hurricane warning was issued about 23 hours before Iris moved ashore. A state of national emergency was declared on October 8 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts. A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital in Belize City was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. Overall, 11,380 people evacuated their homes in Belize, including many in Belize City. These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll. Hurricane Keith had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect. Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.

On October 8, the Government of Honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions, advising residents to expect &quot;extreme weather conditions&quot;. About 5,000 people in the country evacuated from their homes. To the north of Belize, officials in Mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports.

==Impact==
===Lesser and Greater Antilles===
While Iris was in its development stages, residents as far north as Saint Thomas reported rain and thunderstorms. In the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped around of rainfall along the coast, forcing 35 families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks. The rains triggered a landslide outside of Santo Domingo that destroyed a home, killing a family of three. There was another landslide in the region that injured two people. Iris&#x27;s passage near Jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others, causing one injury. Otherwise, damage in the country was minimal.

===Wave Dancer===
A scuba diving boat overturned during the hurricane near Big Creek, Belize, possibly hit by a tornado. The boat, named the &quot;Wave Dancer&quot;, had 28 people on board, including 20 from the Richmond Dive Club out of Richmond, Virginia; most of them were upstairs in the boat, and none were diving. The captain had delayed returning to shore, and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock, not anticipating the ferocity. Iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock, causing it to overturn in waters. Eight people survived, and 11 bodies were recovered; it was presumed that 20 people died during the wreck, including 15 from the Richmond area and three crew members.

Another boat, the &quot;Vendera&quot;, also reportedly capsized with people on board.

===Belize===
Hurricane Iris moved ashore in Belize with winds of , although the highest measured winds were at a station in Big Creek. Because of its small diameter, Iris produced heavy damage only in a area of southern Belize. In that region, the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to , with waves of over in height, causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes.

As it moved ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages. In 35 villages, the storm destroyed more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000 people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37 million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.

In southern Belize, the storm&#x27;s strong winds left crop damage, in some cases where the harvest had just begun. About of bananas were destroyed, along with over of rice, of corn, and other crops to a lesser degree. The storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock. The shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch, partly due to contaminated waters. Crop damage in Belize was estimated at $103 million, mostly from banana losses. Iris&#x27;s strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest, with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas. This disrupted the habitats of several animals, and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near Monkey River were killed. The storm&#x27;s strong waves eroded the beach, although marine effects were much less than those of Hurricane Keith in the previous year. Nevertheless, there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm, possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.

Nationwide, Iris damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes, directly affecting a total of 21,568 people, or 8.5% of the total population. The storm damaged or destroyed 31 schools and 17 health facilities, along with 21 government buildings. There was about $25 million in damage to the transportation sector, including highways and bridges. Iris killed 24 people in and around the country, including the victims of the &quot;Wave Dancer&quot; shipwreck. Overall damage was estimated at $250 million, making it the most damaging storm in the country since Hurricane Hattie in 1961.

===Elsewhere in Central America===
High tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both Guatemala and Honduras. In the former, the hurricane&#x27;s rainfall generally amounted to , triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100 people. The damage was heaviest in Petén Department in the northern portion of the country. The storm damaged 26 schools and 2,500 homes in the country&#x27;s interior. An estimated 27,500 people were affected by the storm throughout Guatemala. There were eight deaths in the country, two of them the result of falling trees.

The remnants of Iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern Mexico, accumulating in the southern state of Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120 houses. A mudslide in one village demolished 20 homes and killed a child, while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river.

==Aftermath==
On October 9, the government of Belize issued the &quot;all clear&quot; signal, indicating that the storm had fully passed, and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment. The government declared Stann Creek and Toledo districts as disaster areas, and officials declared a nighttime curfew. By the day after the storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal. Residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water. Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas. The Belmopan Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims. The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000 people. By October 19, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2 million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer. After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000 families in need of subsidence. By October 31, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800 people severely affected by the storm. Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14 villages affected by the storm. The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.

The government of Belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following Iris&#x27;s landfall, and various countries provided aid. The United Kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water. The United States also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting. Although sustaining significant damage, the Government of Guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in Belize. Mexico sent blankets, mattresses, food, and water, as well as a medical team. The Japanese government sent tents and blankets, and the Chinese government donated of rice and dried fruits. Various United Nations departments donated about $225,000.

The American victims of the &quot;Wave Dancer&quot; boat wreck were flown back to the Richmond, Virginia area following the storm. The insurance company covering the boat reached a $4 million settlement, which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims&#x27; families. The boat operator remained in business following the accident.

===Retirement===

On account of the damage left behind by the hurricane in Guatemala and Belize, the name &quot;Iris&quot; was retired in the spring of 2002 by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Ingrid&quot; for the 2007 season.

<doc id="974732" wikidata="Q3828621" url="?curid=974732" title="Cities of the Red Night">
<text>Cities of the Red Night is a 1981 novel by American author William S. Burroughs. His first full-length novel since &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; (1971), it is part of his final trilogy of novels, known as The Red Night Trilogy, followed by &quot;The Place of Dead Roads&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Western Lands&quot; (1987). The plot involves a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by Captain James Misson. In near present day, a parallel story follows a detective searching for a lost boy, abducted for use in a sexual ritual. The cities of the title mimic and parody real places, and Burroughs makes references to the United States, Mexico, and Morocco.

==Plot==
The plot follows a nonlinear course through time and space. It imagines an alternate history in which Captain James Misson&#x27;s Libertatia lives on. His way of life is based on &quot;The Articles&quot;, a general freedom to live as one chooses, without prejudice. The novel is narrated from two different standpoints; one set in the 18th century which follows a group of pirate boys led by Noah Blake, who land in Panama to liberate it. The other is set in the late 20th century, and follows a detective tracing the disappearance of an adolescent boy.

==Development==
In a March 15, 1966 letter to Brion Gysin, Burroughs describes a project he was working on at the time:

This project would become the basis of the chapter &quot;We See Tibet with the Binoculars of the People&quot;. The phrase &quot;we see Tibet with the binoculars of the people&quot; first appeared in the essay &quot;Ten Years and a Billion Dollars,&quot; in &quot;The Adding Machine&quot;, amongst a group of random phrases selected from Konstantīns Raudive&#x27;s book &quot;Breakthrough&quot;. Several of those phrases became chapter titles in &quot;Cities of the Red Night&quot;.

==Reception==
Burroughs&#x27;s biographer Ted Morgan writes that one of the book&#x27;s themes is &quot;the cities themselves, imaginary cities located in the Gobi Desert 100,000 years ago, the names of which were magic words that Brion Gysin had once taught him, saying, &#x27;If you want to get to the bottom of something, you should repeat those words before going to sleep.&#x27; Their ultimate source is the Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm, better known in the west as the Picatrix, specifically the Invocation of the Perfect Nature within that text. The city of Waghdas is in the grip of a cholera epidemic, which turns out to be a virus that is sexual in origin&quot;. Morgan notes that while this disease is similar to AIDS, the novel was written when AIDS was unheard of. Morgan concludes that &quot;Cities of the Red Night&quot; is, &quot;certainly the most compelling and inventive of Burroughs&#x27; books since &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="974736" wikidata="Q422219" url="?curid=974736" title="Cloxacillin">
<text>Cloxacillin is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of several bacterial infections. This includes impetigo, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and otitis externa. It is not effective for methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). It can be used by mouth and by injection.
Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; diarrhea may also occur. It is not recommended in people who have previously had a penicillin allergy. Use during pregnancy appears to be relatively safe. Cloxacillin is in the penicillin family of medications.
Cloxacillin was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in the United States.

==Mechanism of action==
It is semisynthetic and in the same class as penicillin. Cloxacillin is used against staphylococci that produce beta-lactamase, due to its large R chain, which does not allow the beta-lactamases to bind. This drug has a weaker antibacterial activity than benzylpenicillin, and is devoid of serious toxicity except for allergic reactions.

==Society and culture==
Cloxacillin was discovered and developed by Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline).

It is sold under a number of trade names, including Cloxapen, Cloxacap, Tegopen and Orbenin.

<text>Homer Ransford Watson (January 14, 1855 – May 30, 1936) was a Canadian landscape painter. He has been characterized as the painter who first painted Canada as Canada, rather than as a pastiche of European painting. He was a member and president (1918–1922) of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, as well as a founding member and first president (1907–1911) of the Canadian Art Club. Although Watson had almost no formal training, by the mid-1920s he was well known and admired by Canadian collectors and critics, his rural landscape paintings making him one of the central figures in Canadian art from the 1880s until the First World War.

==Life and career==

Homer Ransford Watson was born on 14 January 1855, in Doon, Ontario, the second of Ransford and Susan Mohr Watson&#x27;s five children. A small village founded in the 1830s at the junction of Schneider&#x27;s Creek and the Grand River, Doon&#x27;s earliest documented population was 150 in the 1871 census. Watson descended from German Mennonite settlers who arrived in Ontario in the early 19th century. His father, a mill and factory owner, died in 1861 when Watson was six years old. Following Ransford&#x27;s death, the family&#x27;s only source of income was Susan&#x27;s work as a seamstress. Ransford left behind a library of books that Watson studied from and influenced his early drawings. A gift of a set of paints from an aunt made him decide to become an artist. He sought the advice of Thomas Mower Martin in Toronto, and moved there in 1874. He copied works at the Toronto Normal School and was mainly self-taught, but met other artists in Toronto (e.g., Lucius O&#x27;Brien) while working part-time at the Notman-Fraser photography studio.

In 1876, Watson traveled to New York State, and may have seen the work of painter George Inness. Although he never met Inness, he was influenced by the Hudson River School and painted along the Hudson and Susquehanna Rivers in the Adirondack Mountains. In 1880, the Marquis of Lorne opened the first exhibition of the Canadian Academy; Watson&#x27;s work was displayed and he was elected an Associate member. That same year, he sold a major work, &quot;The Pioneer Mill,&quot; to the Marquis for Queen Victoria.

Watson married Roxanna (Roxa for short) Bechtel in 1881, and the couple moved into the Drake House at Doon. They bought the house in 1883, and he kept the house as his permanent residence until his death. Watson painted the rural Grand River countryside for most of his artistic life. He was noted for his commitment to Canadian landscapes: he said at a lecture on &quot;The Methods of Some Great Landscape Painters&quot; at the University of Toronto in 1900: &quot;there is at the bottom of each artistic conscience a love for the land of their birth... no immortal work has been done which has not as one of its promptings for its creation a feeling its creator had of having roots in his native land and being a product of its soil&quot;.

The artists with whom Watson was most often associated were the English landscape painter John Constable (1776–1837) and such French Barbizon artists as Théodore Rousseau (1812–1867), Charles-François Daubigny (1817–1878), Narcisse Díaz de la Peña (1807–1876), Constant Troyon (1810–1865), Jules Dupré (1811–1889), and tangentially Jean-François Millet (1814–1875) because Watson didn`t share Millet`s focus on the nobility of human figures. The thematic, formal, and psychological similarities between Watson, John Constable, and the Barbizon artists were strong. They were emotionally and psychologically devoted to landscapes with whose topography and inhabitants they were intimately familiar.

In 1882, while touring Canada, Oscar Wilde first noted the similarity between Watson and Constable, dubbing him the &quot;Canadian Constable&quot; due to the similarity between Watson&#x27;s work and of the great English landscape painter. Wilde and Watson may have met at public events. There may have been letters between the two men which could be in a private collection or lost.

Watson moved to England in 1887 for three years (1887–1890), and further established his reputation. Over the next few years, his works became increasingly popular among collectors and received prizes at expositions across North America. In 1902, at the height of his British career, he exhibited &quot;The Flood Gate&quot;. In 1904, he won a bronze medal at the Canadian exhibition at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri.

He campaigned to save the Waterloo County woodlands that he had preserved in his landscapes. Due to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in which he lost his savings, he was forced to hand over many works from his personal collection to the local savings &amp; loans firm, which held them for security and then tried to sell the paintings itself.

Homer Watson died in Doon on May 30, 1936.

==Legacy==

Many of Watson&#x27;s works are still on display at his old house, which he and his sister had transformed into a small art gallery. Homer Watson&#x27;s letters, his unpublished manuscripts, and his paintings, drawings, and prints document the issues that most interested him as an artist. Of his concerns, the commemoration of southern Ontario&#x27;s pioneers and early settlers and the visual expression of Canadian regional and national identities locate Watson firmly within the milieu of many of his fellow artists of the time. In addition to these priorities, his dedication to safeguarding the natural environment was exceptional and far-sighted.

On May 27, 2005, Canada Post issued a pair of postage stamps in his honour. Two stamps of denominations 50 and 85 cents were issued depicting two of his works, &quot;Dawn in the Laurentides&quot; and &quot;The Flood Gates&quot;. 
An arterial road in Kitchener, which connects the Doon area to the main parts of the city, is named Homer Watson Boulevard.

Watson has been designated a Person of National Historic Significance in Canada.
Watson&#x27;s former house in Doon, now the Homer Watson House &amp; Gallery, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1980.

<text>Thalwil is a municipality and town in the district of Horgen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland. The municipality includes two parts: Thalwil and Gattikon.

==History==
Thalwil is first mentioned around 1030 as &quot;Talwile villam&quot;, which is derived from &quot;Tellewilare&quot;, Tello&#x27;s Farm, and indicates the early medieval origins of Thalwil as an Alemannic farmstead. Only a few graves remain from this period. In 1133, it was mentioned as &quot;Telwil&quot;.

The parish of Thalwil originally comprised four &quot;Wachten&quot; (hamlets):
*Ludretikon, the oldest hamlet (mentioned in 915), bordering Rüschlikon
*Oberdorf (Upper Village), the area around the church
*Unterdorf (Lower Village), the area roughly south of the railway station
*Langnau, which separated from Thalwil around 1713

In medieval times, the economy consisted mainly of farms, vineyards as well as a small amount of fishing, crafts and shipping (on the lake). This estate was once owned by the Dukes of Habsburg and held by the Barons of Eschenbach. The Abbeys of Muri and Wettingen also had significant interests and owned 12 and 3 farms respectively.

Thalwil also boasts the oldest wood corporation in the Canton of Zurich, the &quot;Bannegg-Waldung&quot;. It was first mentioned in 1483, when Muri Abbey granted it to the twelve beneficiaries of the Abbey farms in Thalwil. Today the corporation is owned by 16 members as well as by the Thalwil Gemeinde.

==Geography==

The municipality of Thalwil is located on the Zimmerberg ridge between the western shore of Lake Zurich and the Sihl river. It includes the town of Thalwil, on the eastern slopes of the ridge alongside the lake, and the village of Gattikon, on the westen slopes and the bank of the Sihl. Thalwil borders on the communes of Rüschlikon, Langnau am Albis, Oberrieden, Horgen and (across the lake) Erlenbach.

The municipality has an area of . Of this area, 18% is used for agricultural purposes, while 23.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 56.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2.2%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 42.3% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (13.7%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 1.4% of the area. 51.3% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction.

==Coat of arms==
The &quot;Gemeindewappen&quot; (communal flag or coat of arms) consists of two diagonally crossed black bulrushes with green stems and leaves on a white background.

The historical population is given in the following table:
=== Local Council ===
The municipal council is the executive body. The Thalwil municipal council consists of nine members, including the president. The municipal clerk supports and relieves the municipal council at the strategic level. He manages the municipal council office.

The following municipal council members were elected for the 2022-2026 legislature:

The Graubünden municipality of Val Müstair was Thalwil&#x27;s sponsoring municipality until 2023.

=== Churches in Thalwil ===
Thalwil is one of the oldest parishes on the shores of Lake Zurich. It also has one of the most spectacular church locations, with the &quot;Platte&quot; affording views of the lake and its surroundings from Zurich to the Alps.

The earliest recorded church was dedicated to St Martin in 1159. In medieval times it was a dependency of Wettingen Abbey. Although it was frequently hit by lightning and also looted and set on fire during the Old Zürich War (Alter Zürichkrieg), the original building survived for over six hundred years.

In 1845, the small and rather dilapidated chapel was demolished and replaced by a much larger church designed by Ferdinand Stadler. A fire set off during repairs on the tower burnt down the new church almost 100 years later (1943) but the building was soon completely restored and has survived to this day.

, there were 5382 Catholics and 5881 Protestants in Thalwil. In the 2000 census, religion was broken down into several smaller categories. From the , 41.5% were some type of Protestant, with 39.3% belonging to the Swiss Reformed Church and 2.2% belonging to other Protestant churches. 34.3% of the population were Catholic. Of the rest of the population, 3.8% were Muslim, 5.8% belonged to another religion (not listed), 2.6% did not give a religion, and 15% were atheist or agnostic.

=== Industrialisation ===
In the late 1830s, the lakeside road (&quot;Seestrasse&quot;) was opened. It soon attracted large silk, cotton and other textile factories to the former farming village, some run by local families such as Schwarzenbach, Schmid, and Kölliker. This growth was boosted by the new railway lines from Zurich to Pfäffikon (1875) and Zug (1897). Industrialisation brought new workers into the former farming village and increased the population from 1,318 (in 1833) to 6,791 (in 1900).

As of 2020, Thalwil has an unemployment rate of 3.1%. , there were 5 people employed in the primary economic sector and 2 businesses involved in this sector. 1,001 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 106 businesses in this sector. 5,576 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 1,193 businesses in this sector. , 28.6% of the working population were employed full-time, and 71.4% were employed part-time.

=== Taxes ===
According to the statistical office of Canton Zurich, Thalwil receives 92.0 million Franc in tax revenue every year, as of 2020. 11,022 people pay taxes to Thalwil.

=== Modern-day Thalwil ===
Today this industrial past has all but vanished. The economy of Thalwil is mainly supported by a variety of small and medium-sized businesses, many located in the Böni commercial estate opened in 1971. This includes Unisys Switzerland, which is the largest employer in Thalwil (over 500 jobs). There is also a range of shops, mainly located around the Gotthardstrasse.

The main source of Thalwil&#x27;s current prosperity lies in the large number of commuters (ca. 7 000) who live there but work in the economic centres of Greater Zurich. Today, Thalwil has mostly left its farming and industrial past behind and become a commuter base.

==Transportation==
Thalwil is located along the A3 motorway from Zurich to Chur as well as on the main railway lines from Zurich to Chur, Lucerne and Italy. In the summer, there are regular boats to Zurich as well as along the lake to Rapperswil, run by the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft. Thalwil railway station is served by lines S2, S8, and S24 of the Zürich S-Bahn. The Zimmerberg bus line (&quot;Zimmerbergbus&quot;), provided by the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn (SZU), connects the Zimmerberg region and parts of the Sihl valley.

<text>The great purple hairstreak (Atlides halesus), also called the great blue hairstreak, is a common gossamer-winged butterfly species in parts of the United States. It is actually a Neotropical species; its North American range only includes the warm-temperate and subtropical parts of that continent, and it ranges southwards almost to the Isthmus of Panama. The type specimen, however, was shipped to Europe from the Colony of Virginia, probably around the time of the United States Declaration of Independence.

The common names refer to the butterfly&#x27;s two main colors – dusky purple on the underside, and iridescent blue above. Particularly the males are very colorful in flight – brilliant blue and velvety black, with bright red and golden markings – but when sitting down they show their inconspicuous dusky purple underside. On each hindwing, there are two tails, with one short and one long tail, lending itself to the name &quot;hairstreak&quot;. Several subspecies are recognized.

Its caterpillar larvae feed on the mistletoe genus &quot;Phoradendron&quot;.

== Description ==
The wingspan on the adult butterfly ranges from 1.25 to 1.5 inches. Despite its common name &quot;great purple hairstreak&quot;, this butterfly does not sport any purple coloration. Instead, the upper-side of the wings are iridescent blue at the center, with a black border, and males typically have both a more extensive and brighter blue wing coloration when compared to their female counterparts. On the hind wings, the butterfly has two sets of tails of unequal length, which are the &quot;hairstreaks&quot; of this butterfly. The under-side of the wings are black, with orange-gold colored spots, with one spot on each of the front wings, and two spots on each hind-wing near the tails. The abdomen of the butterfly features a blue upper-side and an orange under-side.

Like other butterfly species, the morphology of &quot;Atlides halesus&quot;&#x27; hindwings mimic a head. The combination of the tails, resembling antennae of a butterfly, along with the orange spots on each hind-wing, which resembles eyes, gives the butterfly a &quot;false head&quot;. When perching, the butterfly will also orient their body so the tails point upwards while the real head points downwards, in addition to moving their bodies back and forth. The morphology of the hindwings along with this behavior will direct the attention of predators towards the false head, allowing the butterfly to minimize damage towards essential regions of the body by deflecting attack towards the less vulnerable hindwings.

==Life History==
=== Eggs ===
Males of this species wait for possible mates for mating on tall perches such as trees. The mated females then choose mistletoe plants for oviposition. The eggs are laid in either groups or by themselves on the host plant. The eggs appear white with a hard and solid outer surface. During oviposition, female butterflies will lay as many as twenty single eggs at different locations on the leaves of a mistletoe plant.

=== Larvae ===
After hatching, larvae will emerge from the top of the egg, leaving behind an opening at the top of the egg. Once hatched, the larvae do not consume their egg shells as a first source of nutrition as other species of butterflies do. Instead, they go straight into feeding on their host plant&#x27;s leaves and male flowers until fully grown. The species gains protective toxins from their larval host plants that stay in their system into adulthood. The larvae are not colored in a way that warns predators of this, they instead match the green color and round shape of their host plant&#x27;s foliage. This coloration will darken as the caterpillar ages, which also allows for successful camouflage with the leaves of their mistletoe host plant. Caterpillars are commonly spotted in the spring to early summer and have been primarily found on leaves and non-woody stems of mistletoe. Caterpillars will feed on the leaves of their host plant until time of pupation, which is around 20 days from hatching to pupation. The larvae mainly feeds on young leaves on the mistletoe plant, with early instar larvae being unable to chew through older leaves until they develop into late instar caterpillars. In addition, caterpillars have been observed to entirely defoliate their host plant before, leaving behind only the stems.

=== Pupa ===
Next, the larvae pupate in well-protected areas close to the base of trees under pieces of bark or fallen leaves. Pupae appear dark brown and after about a minimum of 16 days, pupae will emerge as the adult stage butterfly.
=== Adult ===
After about 16 days from pupation to hatching, the adult butterfly will emerge from its chrysalis. Adult butterflies have their orange and black colorings to signal the protective toxins and even have a behavior of rubbing their wings together. This draws attention to the markings on their back wings that serve as a &quot;false head&quot;. During flight season, which stretches from spring to early summer, and from early fall to winter, ovipositing females preferentially target isolated mistletoe plants that have trunks of a smaller diameter to lay their eggs on, which is likely to minimize competition from other ovipositing butterflies.

The great purple hairstreak has various natural enemies including parasitoid wasps, the species being &quot;Apanteles&quot; sp. as well as &quot;Metadontia amoena.&quot;

<text>Vertigo Records is a British record company. It was a subsidiary of the Philips/Phonogram record label, launched in 1969 to specialise in progressive rock and other non-mainstream musical styles. Today, it is operated by Universal Music Germany, and the UK catalogue was folded into Mercury Records, which was absorbed in 2013 by Virgin EMI Records, which returned to the EMI Records name in June 2020.

==History==

Vertigo was the brainchild of Olav Wyper when he was Creative Director at Phonogram. It was launched as a competitor to labels such as Harvest (a prog subsidiary of EMI) and Deram (Decca). It was the home to bands such as Colosseum, Jade Warrior, Affinity, Ben and other bands from &#x27;the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of the early-&#x27;70s British prog-folk-post-psych circuit&#x27;. The first Vertigo releases came with a black and white spiral label, which was replaced with Roger Dean&#x27;s spaceship design in 1973. Vertigo later became the European home to various hard rock bands signed to Mercury in North America, such as Bon Jovi, Rush and Kiss.

Vertigo is a division of Republic Records in the United States and operates as EMI Records in the UK, which in turn is a frontline music group operation of Universal Music UK. Island Records manages Vertigo&#x27;s North American back catalogue that was once distributed by Mercury. In France, Vertigo France existed as a sub-label of Universal Music France&#x27;s Barclay Records until 2014, when it was renamed as Island France. In Germany, Vertigo has merged with Capitol Records and is mainly used for German rock artists, and is named &quot;Vertigo/Capitol&quot; (notable contract exception here is Lewis Capaldi, he comes from UK). The label&#x27;s legacy artists include Metallica (outside the US and Canada), Razorlight, Rush (Europe) and Dire Straits (except the US). More recent signings include The Rapture, The Killers (UK/Ireland), One Night Only, Amy Macdonald, Noisettes and Thee Unstrung between 2004 and 2005 and Kassidy in 2009. Black Sabbath returned to the label in 2013 (including the US and Canada for the first time via sister label Republic) until their dissolution in 2017 although former sister label Sanctuary Records Group acquired international rights to their back catalogue in the interim (the band were last on Vertigo in 1987).

Vertigo/Capitol (formerly Vertigo Berlin) is today the only active Vertigo label in the Universal Music Group. Artists signed to Vertigo/Capitol are Rammstein, Chvrches, Herbert Grönemeyer, Andreas Bourani, Haim, AnnenMayKantereit, Gzuz, Volbeat or Sportfreunde Stiller. Unheilig&#x27;s sixth studio album became one of the most successful albums in Germany of all time and sold 2 million albums.
The collaboration album &quot;Palmen aus Plastik 2&quot; by the rapper Bonez MC and RAF Camora stayed for 58 weeks at the German charts and was the first album to have 8 songs in the top 10 single charts in the release week.
Shirin David&#x27;s debut album &quot;Supersize&quot; was the first album by a female hip hop artist to chart at #1. 
Also international artists like Lana Del Rey, Dua Lipa, Sigrid or Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi launched their careers on Vertigo.

<text>René Monteagudo Miranda (March 12, 1916 – September 14, 1973) was a Major League Baseball pitcher and outfielder who played with the Washington Senators (1938, 1940, 1944) and Philadelphia Phillies (1945). Monteagudo threw and batted left-handed.

Monteagudo was born in Havana, Cuba. Signed by the Senators, he debuted as a pitcher on September 6, 1938, but bothered by a sore arm, he switched to the outfield. In 1945, for the Phillies, he was the most used and most successful pinch-hitter in the league, going 18-for-52 (.346). He also pitched 14 games in relief. In 1946, Monteagudo was one of the ballplayers blackballed by Commissioner Happy Chandler after leaving the majors to play in the Mexican League.

In a four-season major league career, Monteagudo was a .289 hitter (78-for-270) with 21 RBI, 32 runs, nine doubles, one triple, and two stolen bases in 156 games. As a pitcher, he posted a 3–7 record with 93 strikeouts, a 6.42 ERA, two saves, and 168 innings in 46 games (11 as a starter). René Monteagudo died in Hialeah, Florida at the age of 57.

His son Aurelio Monteagudo was a right-handed screwball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.

<doc id="974751" wikidata="Q15521463" url="?curid=974751" title="Ethan Zohn">
<text>Ethan Zohn (born November 12, 1973) is an American motivational speaker, former professional soccer player, and reality television series contestant who won &quot;&quot;, the third season of the reality TV series &quot;Survivor&quot;. He went on to compete in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, where he placed 11th and 18th, respectively.

After winning &quot;Survivor: Africa&quot;, Zohn co-founded Grassroot Soccer, which uses soccer to raise money and awareness to fight HIV/AIDS. In 2010, he ranked 14th in USL Second Division&#x27;s Top 15 of the Decade list as one of the most influential players of the United Soccer League Second Division in the previous decade.

==Soccer==
Zohn was a soccer goalkeeper at Lexington High School and Vassar College, and played professionally for the Hawaii Tsunami and Cape Cod Crusaders of the United Soccer Leagues and in Zimbabwe for Highlanders F.C. He donated some of his winnings from Survivor to starting Grassroot Soccer, an organization whose goal is to &quot;mobilize the global soccer community to combat the AIDS epidemic in Africa&quot;. Shortly after winning Survivor Africa, Ethan was hired by ESPN to serve as a sideline reporter for the US National Team&#x27;s matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

In 2005, Zohn began to co-host the Metro Soccer Report (later renamed MSG Soccer Report) on the MSG Network, a weekly show dedicated to New York Red Bulls (formerly MetroStars) of Major League Soccer. In 2006, Zohn began hosting FC Fox on the Fox Soccer Channel.

For his combined humanitarian efforts to spread HIV education throughout Africa via soccer teams for youth and young adults, Zohn received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Africa&quot;===

As part of the Boran tribe, Zohn did not become an immediate target in the game; he was seen as a strong player who could potentially help to win many tribal immunities. When his tribe lost two back-to-back immunity challenges, he joined the majority to vote off Diane Ogden and Jessie Camacho in episodes one and two. Over the next few days, Ethan would form a long-term alliance with Lex Van den Berghe and Tom Buchanan from his Boran tribe.

But a twist in episode five saw both of Zohn&#x27;s alliance members and Kelly Goldsmith switch from Boran to the Samburu tribe, leaving Ethan alone with fellow Boran members Kim Johnson and Clarence Black. Two of the new Boran members from the Samburu tribe, Teresa Cooper and Frank Garrison, had an old misunderstanding with another former Samburu member, Silas Gaither. So, by consensus, after Zohn&#x27;s tribe lost the immunity challenge Gaither was voted out. Both of Zohn&#x27;s alliance members Buchanan and Van den Berghe remained safe on the Samburu tribe, carrying all three into the merge.

Zohn&#x27;s alliance soon began to control the game, with other members Johnson and Goldsmith. They immediately targeted Black due to his physical strength, among other events that had occurred earlier in the game, and he was voted out. But Van den Berghe had received another vote at tribal council, a vote he believed had come from Goldsmith, but which actually came from Cooper. This led Van den Berghe on a witch-hunt against Goldsmith which almost led to the demise of Zohn&#x27;s alliance when Goldsmith possessed the power with the other four ex-Samburu members, Cooper, Garrison, Kim Powers and Brandon Quinton. But at the last minute, Quinton switched his vote, saving Van den Berghe, and voting out Goldsmith. But this move came back to haunt Quinton when Zohn&#x27;s alliance saw him as untrustworthy and voted him out at the next tribal council.

Zohn, Van den Berghe, Buchanan, and Johnson regained control of the game, outing previous Samburu members Garrison, Powers and Cooper in the next three tribal councils, carrying them into the final four. At the next immunity challenge, Johnson, the next target to be voted out, won immunity, leading to the alliance having to resort to voting one of their own out, despite the fact that the challenge contained . At any rate, Zohn joined Van den Berghe and Johnson in voting out Buchanan, carrying them into the Final Three.

At the final three immunity challenge, older tribe member Johnson outlasted the two young, fit men to win immunity in an endurance challenge. With Johnson holding the power to choose who she would sit next to in the Final Two, she chose Zohn.

In the end, Zohn beat out Johnson in a 5–2 vote to become the Sole Survivor, gaining the votes of Goldsmith, Garrison, Cooper, Buchanan, and Van den Berghe.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Zohn was invited to participate in &quot;&quot;, which he gladly accepted. Originally part of the Saboga tribe, Zohn was immediately targeted as a previous winner, along with &quot;&quot; winner Tina Wesson. When Saboga lost immunity, the rest of the tribe decided to vote out Wesson first, needing Zohn&#x27;s strength to win future challenges. When Saboga lost immunity once again, Zohn was spared once more over physical liability Rudy Boesch, who had hurt his ankle previously.

In Episode 5, Zohn and the rest of the Saboga tribe were disbanded after losing a challenge. Zohn and Jerri Manthey joined the Mogo Mogo tribe, while Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham joined Chapera. Later in that episode, Zohn joined the rest of his new tribe to vote out &quot;&quot; winner Richard Hatch.

In Episode 7, Zohn was on the outs when the alliance of Manthey, Lex Van den Berghe, and Shii Ann Huang left him out in their decision to vote out Colby Donaldson. Zohn was shocked at the decision, feeling betrayed by old &quot;&quot; alliance member Van den Berghe.

In Episode 8, Mogo Mogo lost immunity once again, and Zohn, the last former winner, was the sixth person voted out in 11th place, and the eighth person eliminated overall, by a vote of 4–1. He was the most successful of the four previous winners who competed on All-Stars, lasting longer than Wesson, Hatch, and Jenna Morasca, who quit the game on day 9 to be with her ailing mother.

=== &quot;Winners at War&quot; ===

Zohn returned as a contestant on the fortieth season of Survivor, &quot;&quot;, where he was a member of the Sele tribe. Along with &quot;All-Stars&quot; castmate Amber Mariano, Zohn broke Kelly Wiglesworth&#x27;s record for the longest gap between seasons. He was placed on the Sele tribe, where he joined an alliance of &quot;Old-School&quot; players formed by Rob Mariano and Parvati Shallow. Zohn was targeted by Jeremy Collins and Michele Fitzgerald shortly after as a ploy to weaken Mariano and Shallow, and he was the 4th person voted out. Zohn remained at the Edge of Extinction for the remaining duration of the season, during which he openly spoke out about his health issues and his drive to never give up. He was defeated by Tyson Apostol and Natalie Anderson respectively at the two Edge return challenges and became a permanent member of the jury on day 35. He later voted for Anderson to win the season, although she finished second to Tony Vlachos.

In 2022, the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; named Zohn one of &quot;The Top 10 Jewish Reality TV Stars of All Time.&quot;

==Other media appearances==
Zohn was a contestant on a February 28, 2005, episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, in which he competed against other reality TV competition winners, including his then-girlfriend Jenna Morasca, who was the winner of &quot;&quot;. He finished second, losing to former &quot;Bachelorette&quot; winner Ryan Sutter. Later that year, he appeared on &quot;Kill Reality&quot;, which followed various reality television personalities as they filmed a horror movie called &quot;The Scorned&quot;.

In October 2006 Zohn appeared on an episode of the VH1 series Celebrity Paranormal Project. He and his team investigated alleged paranormal activity at the Warson Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

In 2008 Zohn hosted &quot;Earth Tripping&quot;, a six-episode TV series, in which he demonstrated how to be &quot;an earth-friendly traveler&quot;, and shows viewers &quot;how to employ new, natural and environmentally conscious methods when they travel&quot;. During the series Zohn visited New York City, Mexico City, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In 2011, Zohn and his longtime girlfriend and fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; winner Jenna Morasca participated in the 19th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. They were one of the two teams eliminated in the double-elimination leg, and finished 10th for the season after two legs.

Zohn appeared in the 11th episode of the Discovery Channel show &quot;PitchMen&quot;, in which he presented the EZ Crunch Bowl, a cereal bowl he designed to in which the cereal is kept in the shallow end and the milk in the deeper end in order to keep the cereal &quot;crunchy&quot; and not soggy. The bowl was picked by the show&#x27;s co-stars, Billy Mays and Anthony Sullivan, for manufacturing and marketing by Telebrands. The EZ Crunch Bowl was sent to Telebrands product engineers for improvement before being made available to the public.

Zohn has co-hosted &quot;Outside Today&quot; on the cable TV network &quot;Outside Television&quot;.

In 2024, he appeared as a guest on the Dropout series &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; with fellow Survivor contestants Natalie Bolton, Cirie Fields, and Parvati Shallow.

==Personal life==

Zohn is Jewish. His father died from cancer when he was 14 years old.

On April 30, 2002, Zohn called into the Howard Stern Show and shared he was working as a motivational speaker, often in Jewish venues where he shared how Judaism helped him achieve success. He also revealed he had gone on five dates with Jennifer Love Hewitt after meeting her back stage at the Live With Regis and Kelly show, and the two were regularly in touch by telephone (at the time).

Zohn began dating fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; champion Jenna Morasca after her victory on &quot;&quot; in 2003. They both lived in Manhattan. In an interview on &quot;Rob Has a Podcast&quot;, it was revealed that Zohn and Morasca were considered to return in &quot;&quot;, after applying for &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The couple declined the offer, saying they were not interested in competing against each other. In February 2013, Zohn and Morasca confirmed that they had amicably ended their relationship. On July 21, 2015, Zohn announced his engagement to New York City interior designer Lisa Heywood. They were married on July 16, 2016, in North Bennington, Vermont, in a Jewish ceremony. Zohn and his wife advocate a paleo diet that is high in meat and vegetables.

On April 30, 2009, Zohn was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer called CD20-positive Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. He started chemotherapy in May 2009. On September 14, 2009, he disclosed that after three months of intensive chemotherapy, his cancer returned. He underwent a new treatment, including a stem-cell transplant, to battle the rare form of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. Zohn received a &quot;clean CT scan&quot; in late April 2010 and remained in remission for nearly 20 months. In September 2011, Zohn confirmed that the cancer had returned in his chest. In early March 2013, Zohn announced via &quot;The Jeff Probst Show&quot; that he was cancer-free due to two rounds of stem cell transplants that he received from his brother.

As of May 2021, Zohn lives in Hillsboro, New Hampshire.

<text>Gideon Granger (July 19, 1767 – December 31, 1822) was an early American politician and lawyer. He was the father of fellow Postmaster General and U.S. Representative Francis Granger.

==Early life==
Granger was born in Suffield, Connecticut on July 19, 1767. He was the son of Gideon Granger (1735–1800) and Tryphosia (née Kent) Granger (1738–1796).

He attended and graduated from Yale University and became a lawyer.

==Career==
Granger was considered a brilliant political essayist. Using the pseudonyms Algernon Sydney and Epaminondas many of his writings, defending Jeffersonian principles, were published in many pamphlets.

He was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives and ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress in the 1797 special election for one of Connecticut&#x27;s at-large congressional seats. A staunch supporter of Thomas Jefferson, Granger was appointed as Postmaster General at the start of his term in 1801. He served in this post until 1814 when Jefferson&#x27;s successor, James Madison, replaced him. He is the longest serving Postmaster General as of 2022.

After leaving Washington, D.C., Granger settled in Canandaigua, New York, where he built a homestead that would be &quot;unrivaled in all the nation&quot; from which he could administer the many land tracts he had acquired farther to the west. Today his home is a museum. He became a member of the New York Senate and continued to be influential in politics and law including being a key figure in the Erie Canal project.

==Personal life==
On June 14, 1790, Granger was married to Mindwell Pease (1770–1860), the daughter of Joseph Pease. Together, they were the parents of three sons, including:

* Francis Granger (1792–1868), who married Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer (1798–1823), the granddaughter of Brigadier General Robert Van Rensselaer, who was a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777 and later a member of the New York State Assembly in the 1st, 2nd and 4th New York State Legislatures.
* John Albert Granger (1795–1870), who married Harriet Jackson (1804–1868), the daughter of Amasa Jackson, the first president of the Union Bank of New York, and Mary (née Phelps) Jackson, the only daughter and heiress of Oliver Phelps. Her paternal grandfather was General Michael Jackson, who commanded a regiment of minutemen in the Battle of Lexington.

Ill health forced him to retire early in 1821 and he died the next year on December 31, 1822. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Canandaigua. Granger is the namesake of Granger Township, Ohio.

<text>Clement John Zablocki (November 18, 1912December 3, 1983) was a Polish American politician from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was one of Wisconsin&#x27;s longest-serving members of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 4th congressional district for 18 terms, from 1949 until his death in 1983.

A liberal Democrat, he built his reputation in foreign policy by taking strong anti-communist positions and supporting the Vietnam War. He was a sponsor of the original Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which launched the American intervention, but near the end of the war he was a driving force for the War Powers Resolution, which sought to put restraints on the war-making powers of future presidents. He rose to become chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for the last seven years of his career.

==Early life and education==
Clement Zablocki was born, raised, and lived most of his life in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The son of Polish immigrants, he grew up speaking both Polish and English in Milwaukee&#x27;s flourishing Polish American community. He attended St. Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Parochial School and then graduated from Marquette University High School. He took lessons as an organist from age 10, and earned money for college by performing at church services and directing the church choir. He also worked as a department store clerk. He went on to attend Milwaukee&#x27;s Marquette University, where he earned his Ph.B. in 1936. After graduating, he continued his work as a musician, and supplemented his income by teaching English and citizenship test preparation courses for Polish immigrants.

==Early political career==
According to Milwaukee legend, Zablocki often emphasized with his Polish immigrant students the importance of participating in American politics. At one point, a student in his class, Mrs. Geniusz, responded to him saying that if he knew so much about politics, he should run for office. Zablocki responded by immediately declaring his candidacy for Wisconsin Senate. Whether or not that story is true, Zablocki had a strong base to begin a life in politics. His aunt, Leone Wozinski, was a leading figure in Milwaukee&#x27;s Polish American community and was highly active with civic organizations which crossed over into other communities in the city. She introduced Zablocki to those organizations, and he quickly became &quot;the life of the party&quot;.

Zablocki&#x27;s run for Wisconsin Senate in 1938 was his first campaign for public office. He was only 26 and was launching a primary challenge against incumbent Arthur L. Zimny of Wisconsin&#x27;s 3rd Senate district. Zimny had run afoul of local Democrats and the Polish community by accepting a number of personal benefits from the Wisconsin Progressive Party in exchange for his support in organizing the legislature. As it does today, the 3rd Senate district spanned a swath of the south side of the city of Milwaukee, from Walker&#x27;s Point to the Jackson Park neighborhood, comprising many of the Polish American neighborhoods of the city. In addition to Zablocki, however, six other Democrats also sought to challenge Zimny in 1938, significantly diluting the vote. Zimni won renomination, but Zablocki posted a surprisingly strong second-place finish in the primary, falling only 411 votes short.

Zimny did not run again in 1942, and Zablocki was immediately seen as a frontrunner to replace him. Nevertheless, he did still face a competitive Democratic primary against Richard F. Maruszewski. Zablocki prevailed with 53.6% of the vote.

In the state Senate, Zablocki championed common Democratic issues of the time, supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, labor unions, and veterans benefits, but was deep in the minority and held little influence in the crafting of legislation. He defeated a primary challenge from former state representative Martin Franzkowiak in 1946, and won a landslide in the general election. In the Spring 1948 election, Zablocki sought election as Milwaukee city comptroller, but lost.

==Congress==

In 1946, Milwaukee&#x27;s then-incumbent congressman Thaddeus Wasielewski lost the Democratic primary when seeking re-election, and then ran as an independent in the general election, splitting the Democratic vote and allowing Republican John C. Brophy to eke out a victory with 36% of the vote. When Wasielewski indicated he would not run again in 1948, Zablocki jumped into the race and quickly cleared the primary field. In the general election, however, Zablocki faced the danger of a split Democratic vote again, as the 1946 Democratic nominee Edmund V. Bobrowicz entered the race on the Progressive Party ticket. Zablocki and other prominent Milwaukee Democrats sought to head off this problem by denouncing Bobrowicz over past communist affiliations. The incumbent, Brophy, had only served on the Milwaukee City Council before his election to Congress and was regarded by the Wisconsin press as a weak campaigner relative to the gregarious Zablocki. At the general election, Zablocki won by a wide margin, taking nearly 56% of the vote.

He represented Wisconsin&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which at that time comprised all of the southern half of Milwaukee County, including the south side of the city of Milwaukee, and also included the city and town of Wauwatosa. He was sworn in at the start of the 81st Congress and was reelected 17 times, serving from January 3, 1949, until his death on December 3, 1983. Zablocki faced several primary challenges during his career and nearly always faced a Republican opponent in the general election, but he never received less than 60% in another election after the 1948 general.

===Early years in Congress===
Zablocki was assigned to the House Foreign Affairs Committee from his first term in Congress. He immediately struck a strong anti-communist line, insisting that the United States should not recognize the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China, and asserting that the people of China—and those of Eastern Europe—would eventually overthrow Communism. Controversially, he also then said that the U.S. should sooner recognize the Franco regime than Communist China. During his first term, he also hailed the establishment of the state of Israel on the first anniversary of its founding, praising it as a haven for refugees and displaced persons after the devastation of . Zablocki&#x27;s continued support for rapprochement with Francoist Spain also led him into a public dispute with then-U.S. President Harry S. Truman in 1952. Zablocki also supported the Republican plan to invite General Douglas MacArthur to testify before Congress after his dismissal by President Truman.

Politically, Zablocki also clashed in these early years with the state Democratic Party leadership, particularly over patronage opportunities.

===U.S. Senate special election (1957)===
Zablocki made only one attempt to run for higher office after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. That attempt occurred in the 1957 special election for U.S. Senate following the death of senator Joseph McCarthy. In the Democratic primary election, Zablocki was opposed by former state representative William Proxmire, who had been the Democratic nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in the previous three general elections. Proxmire was an enthusiastic campaigner, and was—by then—well known throughout the state. At the primary, Zablocki put up a large majority in Milwaukee County, but Proxmire won nearly every other county and took the nomination easily. After losing the primary, however, Zablocki campaigned in Catholic communities around the state for Proxmire, sometimes accompanied by Massachusetts U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. Their combined efforts led to Proxmire winning a surprise upset in the election, and was then emulated by future Democratic statewide campaigns.

===Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations===

During the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Zablocki was appointed as one of the United States delegates to the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Zablocki was an early supporter of Senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential ambitions, endorsing his presidential campaign in early 1959 and volunteering to run as a Kennedy delegate in the 1960 primary. Later that year, Kennedy attended a series of events in Wisconsin culminating in a Pulaski Day dinner which included a celebration of Zablocki&#x27;s decade of service in Congress. Zablocki later took credit for introducing Kennedy to the Polish-American community, which became part of Kennedy&#x27;s base in the 1960 election. Zablocki was ultimately elected as a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Kennedy would, in 1962, refer to Zablocki as his campaign manager in Wisconsin.

Zablocki shepherded many of Kennedy&#x27;s foreign policy initiatives through Congress, including the Peace Corps, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and his foreign aid program.

===Civil rights===
Zablocki voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but saw significant backlash from his Polish American constituency. After segregationist candidate George Wallace was warmly received by his constituents in 1964, Zablocki began to waver on civil rights issues, opposing a fair housing law and taking other symbolic steps—distancing himself from activist Catholic priest James Groppi and maintaining his membership in the Fraternal Order of Eagles, which then excluded African Americans.

===Vietnam War===
Zablocki was assigned to the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Far East and Pacific, and began taking a particular interest in checking Communist expansion in southeast Asia in the early 1950s. In response to increased activity by the Pathet Lao, he suggested that a United Nations mission might be needed for Laos, not unlike the U.S.-led UN mission that had just fought the Korean War.

Zablocki traveled to South Vietnam to assess the government of president Ngo Dinh Diem just weeks before his assassination in 1963. Zablocki expressed that he believed criticism of Diem was overblown, and accusations of corruption were unfounded. Further, he expressed that there was no viable replacement for Diem, and that the Diem regime would remain stable so long as the United States support remained steadfast.

After the assassinations of Diem and Kennedy, Zablocki opposed increased American troop presence in Vietnam. He remained reticent about utilizing American troops after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, but co-sponsored the enabling Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August 1964. In the year after Tonkin, Zablocki warmed to the idea of direct American involvement in the war, and suggested that he would be comfortable with maintaining an American presence in South Vietnam for more than 15 years.

Although Zablocki&#x27;s position on Vietnam became more politically unpopular within his party as the war dragged on, he easily survived several primary challenges. He served as chair of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s doomed re-election effort in Wisconsin in 1968.

Following the election of Richard Nixon as president, Zablocki continued to support the administration&#x27;s Vietnam policy. Behind the scenes, however, Zablocki was souring on the war. In 1970, he began work on an early version of the War Powers Resolution. By 1971, Zablocki publicly supported a resolution from the House Foreign Affairs Committee calling for Nixon to set a date for a final American withdrawal from Vietnam as part of a broader effort to return American prisoners of war. And in 1972, Zablocki was a co-author of the Case-Zablocki Act, which required that executive agreements by the president be reported to Congress in 60 days. He ultimately helped push through the final version of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, over Nixon&#x27;s veto.

Zablocki remained an advocate for the interests of Vietnam War prisoners of war and missing in action. During May 1973 hearings, Zablocki observed that returning prisoners uniformly had expressed their belief that there were no U.S. servicemen still alive in Vietnam.

===Chair of House Foreign Affairs===
With the retirement of House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Thomas E. Morgan in 1977, Zablocki—with 28 years of seniority in the House—was a strong candidate to succeed him in the 95th Congress. But Zablocki faced intense opposition, led by veteran New York congressman Benjamin Rosenthal. Rosenthal circulated a memo criticizing Zablocki&#x27;s temperament, reputation, and policy positions, accusing him of being more like a conservative Republican on foreign policy issues. Among Rosenthal&#x27;s policy charges, he faulted Zablocki for frequently siding with nationalist parties, such as the South Korean military dictatorship and the Kuomintang of Taiwan. He accused Zablocki of blocking human rights proposals and attempts to cut off or limit support to regimes that were committing human rights violations. He said Zablocki&#x27;s stance on the middle east isolated him from all sides—where Zablocki had suggested withdrawing support from both Israel and Egypt. And he assailed Zablocki&#x27;s continued vocal support for the war in Vietnam long after most of the party had turned against the conflict.

Zablocki reacted angrily and compared the memo to McCarthyism. He charged that Rosenthal&#x27;s criticism was mostly motivated by his opinion that Zablocki was not sufficiently supportive of Israel. He further responded to some of Rosenthal&#x27;s specific points, saying that cutting off aid to allies would not improve human rights, and that withdrawing from Vietnam harmed the United States reputation in Asia. But Zablocki did acknowledge that his support of South Vietnam and other nationalist governments in Asia may have &quot;gone overboard&quot; at times.

Ultimately, 72 Democrats voted against Zablocki becoming chair of the committee, but 182 voted in favor, giving him more than enough support to secure the seat. After taking the chair, Zablocki indicated strong support for the policies of the incoming Jimmy Carter administration, including reopening negotiations over the status of the Panama Canal Zone and holding the Soviet Union to their commitments on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the Helsinki Accords. Zablocki also sought to mend fences with Rosenthal, saying the first bill he would issue from his committee would be an amendment to the Export Control Act which would prohibit U.S. traders from joining boycotts against Israel.

At the start of the 96th Congress, President Carter formally recognized the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Zablocki then introduced the Taiwan Relations Act, which clarified and formalized the position of the United States toward Taiwan in the wake of that recognition. The Taiwan Relations Act remains the foundation of U.S.–Taiwan relations, and restricts an American president from making unilateral changes to that policy.

In the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Zablocki sought common ground and consensus with the Republican administration. Reagan strongly disputed the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, which Zablocki had championed. Zablocki—intent on preserving congressional oversight of war powers—negotiated a compromise with Reagan in which his deployment of armed forces to Lebanon would be authorized by Congress, and in exchange Reagan would sign legislation tacitly acknowledging the limits imposed by the war powers resolution.

===Later years and death===
Zablocki was wrapping up his seventh year as chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and was at the height of his power and influence when he suffered a heart attack in his office on November 30, 1983, just before a planned meeting with Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir. Zablocki was hospitalized in critical condition for three days, but did not recover. He died December 3, 1983, at Capitol Hill Hospital (now ).

Zablocki&#x27;s funeral mass was held at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Milwaukee, and was attended by roughly 1,000 people. Distinguished guests included House speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill, several dozen members of Congress, diplomats, and congressional staffers, as well as Wisconsin&#x27;s governor, Tony Earl, both of Wisconsin&#x27;s U.S. senators, and Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier. In his eulogy, Reverend Lesniewski described Zablocki as one who was equally at home with &quot;those who ate caviar and those who ate kielbasa&quot;. Zablocki was buried at Saint Adalbert Catholic Cemetery in Milwaukee.

== Personal life and family==
Clement Zablocki was the fifth of nine children born to Mathias Zablocki and his wife Mary (&quot;née&quot; Jankowski). Both of Zablocki&#x27;s parents were immigrants from the Poznań region, part of Poland that was controlled by the German Empire during their lifetime. The Zablockis were Catholics and were members of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Milwaukee.

Clement Zablocki married his childhood sweetheart, Blanche Janic, in 1937. They had no biological children, but adopted a son and daughter. Zablocki&#x27;s mother and wife died within days of each other in July 1977.

==Legacy==

The Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center at in Milwaukee is named for him, as is the Zablocki Library and the Clement J. Zablocki Elementary School in Milwaukee.

<text>Jerome Howard &quot;Jerry&quot; Saltzer (born October 9, 1939) is an American computer scientist.

==Career==
Jerry Saltzer received an ScD in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1966. His dissertation &#x27;&quot;Traffic Control in a Multiplexed System&quot;&#x27; was advised by Fernando Corbató. In 1966, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.

One of Saltzer&#x27;s earliest involvements with computers was with MIT&#x27;s Compatible Time-Sharing System in the early 1960s. In the later 1960s and early 1970s, he was one of the team leaders of the Multics operating system project. Multics, though not particularly commercially successful in itself, has had a major impact on all subsequent operating systems; in particular, it was an inspiration for Ken Thompson to develop Unix. Saltzer&#x27;s contributions to Multics included the now-standard kernel stack switching method of process switching, as well as oft-cited work on the security architecture for shared information systems.

Saltzer led the Computer Systems Research group of MIT&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Computer Systems Research group was one of the key players in the development of the Internet and ring network technology for local area networks. During this time, Saltzer patented the Proteon ProNet ring network. He is the co-author of &quot;The Protection of Information in Computer Systems.&quot;

From 1984 to 1988 Saltzer served as Technical Director of MIT&#x27;s Project Athena. &quot;Saltzer@mit.edu&quot; is one of the few Athena usernames with a capital letter, and legend has it that several special case hacks were required to support this functionality. In September 1995 Saltzer retired from his full-time faculty position, but continued writing and teaching part-time at MIT.

==Family==
Saltzer is known to all (colleagues, students, friends and family) as &quot;Jerry&quot;. In 1961 he married Marlys Anne Hughes. They have two children: Rebecca (born 1962) and Sarah (born 1963). He has two grandchildren: Hannah (born 1997), and Caroline (born 1999).

==Other interests==
Saltzer is also very interested in 19th century landscape art of the western United States; he has prepared the catalogue raisonné of the paintings of the painter Frederick Ferdinand Schafer (de).

==Software==
Saltzer has been the programmer, a designer, or the inspiration, for a number of important pieces of systems software, which are either still in use or have descendants still being used today:
* RUNOFF, a very early text-formatting program which was the basis for roff and nroff
* TYPSET, the &quot;Project MAC editor&quot;, was the first interactive text editor, developed to write documentation 
* PCIP, the first TCP/IP stack for the IBM PC, which became the basis for a company called FTP Software
* Kerberos, an authentication protocol, part of Project Athena, still widely used today

As Technical Director of Project Athena, he supported development of the X Window System, an open-source windowing system, still used and developed on Unix-like systems.

<doc id="974761" wikidata="Q281606" url="?curid=974761" title="Water memory">
<text>Water memory is the purported ability of water to retain a memory of substances previously dissolved in it even after an arbitrary number of serial dilutions. It has been claimed to be a mechanism by which homeopathic remedies work, even when they are diluted to the point that no molecule of the original substance remains, but there is no theory for it.

Water memory is pseudoscientific in nature; it contradicts the scientific understanding of physical chemistry and is generally not accepted by the scientific community. In 1988, Jacques Benveniste and colleagues published a study supporting a water memory effect amid controversy in &quot;Nature&quot;, accompanied by an editorial by &quot;Nature″s&quot; editor John Maddox urging readers to &quot;suspend judgement&quot; until the results could be replicated. In the years after publication, multiple supervised experiments were made by Benveniste&#x27;s team, the United States Department of Defense, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; programme, and other researchers, but no one has ever reproduced Benveniste&#x27;s results under controlled conditions.

==Benveniste&#x27;s study==

Jacques Benveniste was a French immunologist who sought to demonstrate the plausibility of homeopathic remedies &quot;independently of homeopathic interests&quot; in a major scientific journal. To that end, Benveniste and his team at Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM, French for National Institute of Health and Medical Research) diluted a solution of human antibodies in water to such a degree that there was virtually no possibility that a single molecule of the antibody remained in the water solution.

Nonetheless, they reported, human basophils responded to the solutions just as though they had encountered the original antibody (part of the allergic reaction). The effect was reported only when the solution was shaken violently during dilution. Benveniste stated: &quot;It&#x27;s like agitating a car key in the river, going miles downstream, extracting a few drops of water, and then starting one&#x27;s car with the water.&quot; At the time, Benveniste offered no theoretical explanation for the effect, which was later coined as &quot;water memory&quot; by a journalist reporting on the study.

===Implications===
While Benveniste&#x27;s study demonstrated a mechanism by which homeopathic remedies could operate, the mechanism defied scientific understanding of physical chemistry. A paper about hydrogen bond dynamics is mentioned by some secondary sources in connection to the implausibility of water memory.

===Publication in &quot;Nature&quot; ===
Benveniste submitted his research to the prominent science journal &quot;Nature&quot; for publication. There was concern on the part of &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; editorial oversight board that the material, if published, would lend credibility to homeopathic practitioners even if the effects were not replicable. There was equal concern that the research was simply wrong, given the changes that it would demand of the known laws of physics and chemistry. The editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, John Maddox, stated that, &quot;Our minds were not so much closed as unready to change our whole view of how science is constructed.&quot; Rejecting the paper on any objective grounds was deemed unsupportable, as there were no methodological flaws apparent at the time.

In the end, a compromise was reached. The paper was published in &quot;Nature&quot; Vol. 333 on 30 June 1988, but it was accompanied with an editorial by Maddox that noted &quot;There are good and particular reasons why prudent people should, for the time being, suspend judgement&quot; and described some of the fundamental laws of chemistry and physics which it would violate, if shown to be true. Additionally, Maddox demanded that the experiments be re-run under the supervision of a hand-picked group of what became known as &quot;ghostbusters&quot;, including Maddox, famed magician and paranormal researcher James Randi, and Walter W. Stewart, a chemist and freelance debunker at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

==Post-publication supervised experiments==
Under supervision of Maddox and his team, Benveniste and his team of researchers followed the original study&#x27;s procedure and produced results similar to those of the first published data. Maddox, however, noted that during the procedure, the experimenters were aware of which test tubes originally contained the antibodies and which did not. Benveniste&#x27;s team then started a second, blinded experimental series with Maddox and his team in charge of the double-blinding: notebooks were photographed, the lab videotaped, and vials juggled and secretly coded. Randi even went so far as to wrap the labels in newspaper, seal them in an envelope, and then stick them on the ceiling. This was done so that Benveniste and his team could not read them. The blinded experimental series showed no water memory effect.

Maddox&#x27;s team published a report on the supervised experiments in the next issue (July 1988) of &quot;Nature&quot;. Maddox&#x27;s team concluded &quot;that there is no substantial basis for the claim that anti-IgE at high dilution (by factors as great as 10120) retains its biological effectiveness, and that the hypothesis that water can be imprinted with the memory of past solutes is as unnecessary as it is fanciful.&quot; Maddox&#x27;s team initially speculated that someone in the lab &quot;was playing a trick on Benveniste&quot;, but later concluded that, &quot;We believe the laboratory has fostered and then cherished a delusion about the interpretation of its data.&quot; Maddox also pointed out that two of Benveniste&#x27;s researchers were being paid by the French homeopathic company Boiron.

===Aftermath===
In a response letter published in the same July issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, Benveniste lashed out at Maddox and complained about the &quot;ordeal&quot; that he had endured at the hands of the &quot;Nature&quot; team, comparing it to &quot;Salem witchhunts or McCarthy-like prosecutions&quot;. Both in the &quot;Nature&quot; response and during a later episode of &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot;, Benveniste especially complained about Stewart, who he claimed acted as if they were all frauds and treated them with disdain, complaining about his &quot;typical know-it-all attitude&quot;. In his &quot;Nature&quot; letter, Benveniste also implied that Randi was attempting to hoodwink the experimental run by doing magic tricks, &quot;distracting the technician in charge of its supervision!&quot; He was more apologetic on &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot;, re-phrasing his mention of Randi to imply that he had kept the team &quot;amused&quot; with his tricks and that his presence was generally welcomed. He also pointed out that although it was true two of his team members were being paid by a homeopathic company, the same company had paid Maddox&#x27;s team&#x27;s hotel bill.

Maddox was unapologetic, stating &quot;I&#x27;m sorry we didn&#x27;t find something more interesting.&quot; On the same &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot; show, he dismissed Benveniste&#x27;s complaints, stating that, because of the possibility that the results would be unduly promoted by the homeopathy community, an immediate re-test was necessary. The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the experimenter effect. He also pointed out that the entire test procedure, that Benveniste later complained about, was one that had been agreed upon in advance by all parties. It was only after the test had failed that Benveniste disputed its appropriateness.

The debate continued in the letters section of &quot;Nature&quot; for several issues before being ended by the editorial board. It continued in the French press for some time, and in September Benveniste appeared on the British television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; to debate the events live with Randi and others. In spite of all the arguing over the retests, it had done nothing to stop what Maddox worried about: even in light of the tests&#x27; failure, they were still being used to claim that the experiments &quot;prove&quot; that homeopathy works. One of Benveniste&#x27;s co-authors on the &quot;Nature&quot; paper, Francis Beauvais, later stated that while unblinded experimental trials usually yielded &quot;correct&quot; results (&quot;i.e.&quot; ultradiluted samples were biologically active, controls were not), &quot;the results of blinded samples were almost always at random and did not fit the expected results: some &#x27;controls&#x27; were active and some &#x27;active&#x27; samples were without effect on the biological system.&quot;

==Subsequent research==

In the cold fusion or polywater controversies, many scientists started replications immediately, because the underlying theories did not go directly against scientific fundamental principles and could be accommodated with a few tweaks to those principles. But Benveniste&#x27;s experiment went directly against several principles, causing most researchers to outright reject the results as errors or fabrication, with only a few researchers willing to perform replications or experiments that could validate or reject his hypotheses.

After the &quot;Nature&quot; controversy, Benveniste gained the public support of Brian Josephson, a Nobel laureate physicist with a reputation for openness to paranormal claims. Experiments continued along the same basic lines, culminating with a 1997 paper claiming the effect could be transmitted over phone lines. This was followed by two additional papers in 1999 and another from 2000, in the controversial non-peer reviewed &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;, on remote-transmission, by which time it was claimed that it could also be sent over the Internet.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported in 1999 that, in response to skepticism from physicist Robert Park, Josephson had challenged the American Physical Society (APS) to oversee a replication by Benveniste. This challenge was to be &quot;a randomized double-blind test&quot;, of his claimed ability to transfer the characteristics of homeopathically altered solutions over the Internet:[Benveniste&#x27;s] latest theory, and the cause of the current flap, is that the &quot;memory&quot; of water in a homeopathic solution has an electromagnetic &quot;signature.&quot; This signature, he says, can be captured by a copper coil, digitized and transmitted by wire—or, for extra flourish, over the Internet—to a container of ordinary water, converting it to a homeopathic solution.The APS accepted the challenge and offered to cover the costs of the test. When he heard of this, Randi offered to throw in the long-standing $1 million prize for any positive demonstration of the paranormal, to which Benveniste replied: &quot;Fine to us.&quot; In his &quot;DigiBio NewsLetter&quot;. Randi later noted that Benveniste and Josephson did not follow up on their challenge, mocking their silence on the topic as if they were missing persons.

An independent test of the 2000 remote-transmission experiment was carried out in the US by a team funded by the United States Department of Defense. Using the same experimental devices and setup as the Benveniste team, they failed to find any effect when running the experiment. Several &quot;positive&quot; results were noted, but only when a particular one of Benveniste&#x27;s researchers was running the equipment. &quot;We did not observe systematic influences such as pipetting differences, contamination, or violations in blinding or randomization that would explain these effects from the Benveniste investigator. However, our observations do not exclude these possibilities.&quot;

Benveniste admitted to having noticed this himself. &quot;He stated that certain individuals consistently get digital effects and other individuals get no effects or block those effects.&quot;

Third-party attempts at replication of the Benveniste experiment to date have failed to produce positive results that could be independently replicated. In 1993, &quot;Nature&quot; published a paper describing a number of follow-up experiments that failed to find a similar effect, and an independent study published in &quot;Experientia&quot; in 1992 showed no effect. An international team led by Madeleine Ennis of Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast claimed in 1999 to have replicated the Benveniste results. Randi then forwarded the $1 million challenge to the BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; program to prove the &quot;water memory&quot; theory following Ennis&#x27;s experimental procedure. In response, experiments were conducted with the vice-president of the Royal Society, John Enderby, overseeing the proceedings. The challenge ended with no memory effect observed by the Horizon team. For a piece on homeopathy, the ABC program 20/20 also attempted, unsuccessfully, to reproduce Ennis&#x27;s results. Ennis has claimed that these tests did not follow her own experiment protocols.

== Other scientists ==

In 2003, Louis Rey, a chemist from Lausanne, reported that frozen samples of lithium and sodium chloride solutions prepared according to homeopathic prescriptions showed – after being exposed to radiation – different thermoluminescence peaks compared with pure water. Rey claimed that this suggested that the networks of hydrogen bonds in homeopathic dilutions were different. These results have never been replicated and are not generally accepted - even Benveniste criticised them, pointing out that they were not blinded.

In January 2009, Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Laureate virologist who led the team that discovered the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), claimed (in a paper published in a journal that he set up, which seems to have avoided conventional peer review as it was accepted three days after submission) that the DNA of pathogenic bacteria and viruses massively diluted in water emit radio waves that he can detect. The device used to detect these signals was developed by Jacques Benveniste, and was independently tested, with the co-operation of the Benveniste team, at the request of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That investigation was unable to replicate any effects of digital signals using the device.

In 2010, at the age of 78, Montagnier announced that he would take on the leadership of a new research institute at Jiaotong University in Shanghai, where he plans to continue this work. He claims that the findings &quot;are very reproducible and we are waiting for confirmation by other labs&quot;, but said, in an interview with &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;There is a kind of fear around this topic in Europe. I am told that some people have reproduced Benveniste&#x27;s results, but they are afraid to publish it because of the intellectual terror from people who don&#x27;t understand it.&quot; Montagnier had called Benveniste &quot;a modern Galileo&quot;, but the problem was that &quot;his results weren&#x27;t 100% reproducible&quot;.

== Homeopathic coverage ==
To most scientists, the &quot;memory of water&quot; is not something that deserves serious consideration; the only evidence is the flawed Benveniste work. By contrast, the notion of &quot;memory of water&quot; has been taken seriously among homeopaths. For them, it seemed to explain how some of their remedies might work. 
An overview of the issues surrounding the memory of water was the subject of a special issue of &quot;Homeopathy.&quot; In an editorial, the editor of &quot;Homeopathy&quot;, Peter Fisher, acknowledged that Benveniste&#x27;s original method does not yield reproducible results and declared &quot;...the memory of water is a bad memory: it casts a long shadow over homeopathy and is just about all that many scientists recall about the scientific investigation of homeopathy, equating it with poor or even fraudulent science.&quot; The issue was an attempt to restore some credibility to the notion with articles proposing various, very different theories of water memory, such as electromagnetic exchange of information between molecules, breaking of temporal symmetry, thermoluminescence, entanglement described by a new quantum theory, formation of hydrogen peroxide, clathrate formation, etc. Some of the proposed mechanisms would require overthrowing much of 20th-century physics.

<text>Jack Bonnell Dennis (born October 13, 1931) is an American computer scientist and Emeritus Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The work of Dennis in computer systems and computer languages is recognized to have played a key role in hacker culture. As a Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty member he sponsored easier access to computer facilities at MIT during the early development of the subculture. Much of what would later become Unix came from his early collaboration with Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. This collaborative and open philosophy lives on today.

Dennis was also a member of the Tech Model Railroad Club, which incubated much of the early slang and traditions of hacking.

==Early life and education==
Dennis graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as Bachelor of Science (1953), Master of Science (1954), and Doctor of Science (1958). His doctoral thesis analyzed the relation between mathematical programming problems and electrical networks. After completing his doctorate, Dennis became part of the MIT&#x27;s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science&#x27;s faculty, being promoted to full professor in 1969.

==Career==
As a professor at MIT, Dennis was influential in the work of student Alan Kotok and fellow professors Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. He gave young programmers access to multi-million dollar computers and allowed them to see where their abilities could take them, inspiring a generation of MIT graduates who would shape the computer industry at DEC, Xerox Parc and ARPA.

Dennis was one of the founders of the Multics project. His most important contribution to the project was the concept of the single-level memory. Multics was not fully successful as a commercial project, but it was important because it influenced the design of many other computer operating systems, most importantly the direct inspiration for Ken Thompson (who also worked on the project) to design the first incarnation of Unix. In recognition of his work on the Multics project, Dennis was elected as IEEE Fellow.

Dennis&#x27; research at the MIT focused in Computer Theory and Computer Systems, specifically:

* Theoretical Models for Computation
* Computation Structures
* Structure of Computer Systems
* Semantic Theory for Computer Systems
* Semantics of Parallel Computation
* Computer System Architecture

Dennis has also worked as an independent consultant and research scientist on projects related with parallel computer hardware and software since his retirement from MIT in 1987. He has worked with the NASA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science as visiting scientist, with the Architecture Group of Carlstedt Elektronik (Gothenburg, Sweden), and with Acorn Networks, Inc., as Chief Scientist.

A great part of Dennis&#x27; career has been devoted to non-von Neumann models of computation, architecture, and languages, where programs are not attached to a program counter. Along with his students, Dennis adopted the concepts of single assignment and dataflow, in which instructions are executed as soon as data are available (this specific model is called &quot;static&quot; in contrast to Arvind&#x27;s &quot;dynamic&quot;).

In 2009, Dennis was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to sharing and protection in computer systems and parallel architectures based on data flow principles.

==Awards and recognitions==
* IEEE John von Neumann Medal, 2013
* Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (SIGOPS) Hall of Fame, 2012
* Member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), 2009
* Eckert-Mauchly Award, 1984
* IEEE Fellow
* ACM Fellow

<doc id="974766" wikidata="Q884628" url="?curid=974766" title="Bloch MB.200">
<text>The MB.200 was a French bomber aircraft of the 1930s designed and built by Societé des Avions Marcel Bloch. A twin-engined high-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage, over 200 MB.200s were built for the French Air Force, and the type was also licence built by Czechoslovakia, but it soon became obsolete, and was largely phased out by the start of the Second World War.

==Development and design==
The Bloch MB.200 was designed in response to a 1932 requirement for a new day/night bomber to equip the French Air Force. It was a high-winged all-metal cantilever monoplane, with a slab-sided fuselage, powered by two Gnome &amp; Rhône 14Kirs radial engines. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage and featured an enclosed cockpit for the pilots. Defensive machine guns were in nose and dorsal gun turrets and an under fuselage gondola.

The first of three prototypes flew on 26 June 1933. As one of the winning designs for the competition, (the other was the larger Farman F.221), an initial order for 30 MB.200s was placed on 1 January 1934, entering service late in that year. Further orders followed, and the MB.200 equipped 12 French squadrons by the end of 1935. Production in France totalled over 208 aircraft (4 by Bloch, 19 by Breguet, 19 by Loire, 45 by Hanriot, 10 by SNCASO and 111 by Potez).

==Operational history==
Czechoslovakia chose the MB.200 as part of a modernisation program for its air force of the mid-1930s. Although at the rate of aircraft development at that time, the MB.200 would quickly become obsolete, the Czechoslovakians needed a quick solution involving the license production of a proven design, as their own aircraft industry did not have sufficient development experience with such a large aircraft, or with all-metal airframes and stressed-skin construction, placing an initial order for 74 aircraft. After some delays, both Aero and Avia began license-production in 1937, with a total of about 124 built. Czechoslovakian MB.200s were basically similar to their French counterparts, with differences in defensive armament and other equipment.

The Spanish Republic acquired 2 units thirty days after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. These units were sent to Barcelona. Later, 30 units more were sent by ship and assembled in Air France&#x27;s workshop at Prat de Llobregat. A third of the whole airfleet were shot down during the first months of the conflict and the rest were limited to the defense of the republican east coast during the rest of the war serving under the &quot;Escuadra 7&quot; and the &quot;Grupo 72&quot; combined with other French bombers. None of the 32 planes survived the conflict.

The gradual German conquest of Czechoslovakia meant that MB.200s eventually passed under their control, including aircraft that were still coming off the production line. As well as serving in the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, some bombers were distributed to Bulgaria.

Vichy France deployed a squadron of MB.200s against the Allied invasion of Lebanon and Syria in 1941, carrying out at least one daylight bombing mission against British shipping.

<text>Peter James Denning (born January 6, 1942) is an American computer scientist and writer. He is best known for pioneering work in virtual memory, especially for inventing the working-set model for program behavior, which addressed thrashing in operating systems and became the reference standard for all memory management policies. He is also known for his works on principles of operating systems, operational analysis of queueing network systems, design and implementation of CSNET, the ACM digital library, and codifying the great principles of computing. He has written numerous influential articles and books, including an overview of fundamental computer science principles, computational thinking, and his thoughts on innovation as a set of learnable practices.

== Early life and education ==
Denning was born January 6, 1942, in Queens, New York, and raised in Darien, Connecticut. He took an early interest in science, pursuing astronomy, botany, radio, and electronics while in grade school. At Fairfield Prep, he submitted home-designed computers to the science fair in 1958, 1959, and 1960. His second computer, which solved linear equations using pinball machine parts, won the grand prize.

He attended Manhattan College for a Bachelor in EE (1964) and then MIT for a PhD (1968). At MIT he worked on Project MAC and contributed to the design of the pioneering Multics operating system. His PhD thesis, &quot;Resource allocation in multiprocess computer systems&quot;, introduced seminal ideas in working sets, locality, thrashing, and system balance.

==Career and research==
At Princeton University from 1968 to 1972, Denning wrote his classic book, &quot;Operating Systems Theory&quot; (1973), with E G Coffman. He collaborated with Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman on optimality proofs for paging algorithms, and on a simple proof that compilers based on precedence parsing do not need to backtrack. At Purdue University (1972–1983) he supervised numerous PhD theses validating locality-based theories of memory management and extending the new mathematics of operational analysis of queueing networks. He co-founded CSNET. He became department head in 1979 and completed another book on computational models, &quot;Machines, Languages, and Computation&quot;, with Jack Dennis and Joe Qualitz.

At NASA Ames from 1983 to 1991, he founded the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) and turned it into one of the first centers for interdisciplinary research in computational and space science.

At George Mason University from 1991 to 2002 he headed the Computer Science Department, was an associate dean and vice provost, and founded the Center for the New Engineer. The Center was a pioneer in web-based learning. He created a design course for engineers, called &quot;Sense 21&quot;, which was the basis of his project to understand innovation as a skill. He created a course on Core of Information Technology, the basis of his Great Principles of Computing project.

At Naval Postgraduate School since 2002, he heads the Computer Science Department, and directs the Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority. He chaired the faculty council.

Denning has served continuously as a volunteer in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since 1967. In that time, he served as president, vice president, three board chairs, Member-at-Large, Editor of ACM Computing Surveys, and Editor of the monthly ACM Communications. He received seven ACM awards for service, technical contribution, and education. ACM presented him with a special award in June 2007 recognizing 40 years of continuous service.

Denning has received 26 awards for service and technical contributions. These include one quality customer service award, three professional society fellowships, three honorary degrees, six awards for technical contribution, six for distinguished service, and seven for education.

Denning&#x27;s career has been a search for fundamental principles in multiple subfields of computing. He writes prolifically. From 1980 to 1982 he wrote 24 columns as ACM President, focusing on technical and political issues of the field. From 1985 to 1993 he wrote 47 columns on &quot;The Science of Computing&quot; for 
&quot;American Scientist&quot; magazine, focusing on scientific principles from across the field. Beginning in 2001 he has written quarterly &quot;IT Profession&quot; columns for &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, focusing on principles of value to practicing professionals.

=== Virtual memory ===
In 1970 he published a classic paper that displayed a scientific framework for virtual memory and the validating scientific evidence, putting to rest a controversy over virtual memory stability and performance.

In 1966 he proposed the working set as a dynamic measure of memory demand, and explained why it functioned using the locality idea introduced by Les Belady of IBM. His working set paper became a classic. It received an ACM Best paper award in 1968 and a SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award in 2005.

=== Operating system principles ===
In the early 1970s he collaborated with Ed Coffman Jr., on &quot;Operating Systems Theory&quot;, which became a classic textbook used in graduate courses and stayed in print until 1995. That book helped to erase doubts that the OS field could be approached as a science.

In the middle 1970s he collaborated with Jeffrey Buzen on operational analysis, extending Buzen&#x27;s basic operational laws to deal with all queueing networks. The operational framework explained why computer performance models work so well, even though violating the traditional stochastic Markovian assumptions. It has become the preferred method for teaching performance prediction in computing courses.

In the early 1980s, he was one of the four founding principal investigators of the Computer Science Network (CSNET), sponsored by the National Science Foundation The other three were Dave Farber, Larry Landweber, and Tony Hearn. They led the development of a fully self-supporting CS community network that by 1986 included 165 sites and 50,000 users. CSNET was the key transitional stepping stone from the original ARPANET to the NSFNET and then the Internet. In 2009, the Internet Society awarded CSNET its prestigious Jon Postel award, recognizing its key role in bridging from the ARPANET to NSFNET.

Denning led the ACM Digital Library project 1992-97, which went live in 1997. The Association for Computing Machinery became the first professional society to offer a fully searchable library of everything it ever published.

=== Great Principles of Computing ===
In 1999, Denning expanded the search for fundamental principles to cover all of computing. The discovery of natural information processes in biology, physics, economics, materials, and other fields convinced him that the basic definitions of computation had to be modified to encompass natural information processes as well as artificial. He and his team have produced a draft framework.

The Great Principles framework revealed that &quot;innovating&quot; is a core practice of computing. Unable to find anyone who understood how to teach the skill of innovating, he joined with Bob Dunham and identified eight foundational practices of innovation. In 2011, they published &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Way&quot;, a book laying the eight essential practices of successful innovation.

In 2015, he and Craig H. Martell co-authored &quot;Great Principles of Computing&quot;, a slim volume which summarizes computer science principles which are fundamental to all technologies, in a form accessible to computer science students as well as those seeking a readable overview of the field.

In 2019, he and Matti Tedre published &quot;Computational Thinking&quot; as part of the &quot;MIT Press Essential Knowledge&quot; series of concise books, providing an overview of what computational thinking is, and its applications in scientific thought and investigation.

=== Computing education ===
Denning has been a major influence in computing education. In the early 1970s he led a task force that designed the first core course on operating systems (OS) principles. OS became the first CS core course which was not focused on pure mathematical theory, though it still used math freely as needed. In the mid-1980s he led a joint ACM/IEEE committee that described computing as a discipline with nine core functional areas and three cognitive processes, the basis of ACM Curriculum 1991. In the 1990s, he set out on a quest to codify the great principles of computing.

Denning maintains that computing is a science both of natural and artificial information processes. NSF designated him a Distinguished Education Fellow in 2007 to launch a movement to use the Great Principles framework for innovations in education and research. In 2009, ACM&#x27;s SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) recognized his contributions with its lifetime service award.

=== Humor ===
Denning is an inveterate punster who frequently uses humor to get points across. Examples:
* April Fool special section (when he was editor), &quot;ACM Communications&quot; (April 1984)
* On Active and Passive Writing, a treatise exhorting students to write in the active voice
* A Tale of Two Islands is a fable about a controversy in queueing theory over operational analysis, first published in 1991. Contained as an appendix to a 2006 overview of operational analysis

=== Quotes ===
* Computation is the principle; the computer is the tool.
* All speech is free. It&#x27;s just the consequences that get you.
* A request is not in the words you speak. It is in the listening of those who hear you.
* Those who have devoted many years trying to make computers behave like brains have succeeded mainly in cultivating brains that think like computers!
* Locality is a principle of nature. Caching works because our brains organize information by localities.
* Innovation is not brilliant new ideas; it is new practice adopted by a community.
* Solidarity, not software, generates collaboration.

<text>Robert M. Graham (1929 in Michigan, US – January 2, 2020) was a cybersecurity researcher computer scientist and Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was born to a Scottish emigrant.

He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Michigan. While working at the UofM&#x27;s Computing Center he co-authored two compilers, GAT for the IBM 650 and MAD for the IBM 704/709/7090.

In 1963 he moved to MIT to participate in the development of Multics, one of the first virtual memory time-sharing computer operating systems. He had responsibility for protection, dynamic linking, and other key system kernel areas.

Later worked at University of California, Berkeley, City College of New York, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Officially retired in 1996, but continued to teach until the end of 2003.

In 1996 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

He is the author of numerous books and professional articles.

<text>Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The well-known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

The name has been a registered trademark of Hasbro Inc. since 1998 following purchase of the company that had acquired the Denys Fisher company. The Spirograph brand was relaunched worldwide in 2013, with its original product configurations, by Kahootz Toys.

==History==
In 1827, Greek-born English architect and engineer Peter Hubert Desvignes developed and advertised a &quot;Speiragraph&quot;, a device to create elaborate spiral drawings. A man named J. Jopling soon claimed to have previously invented similar methods. When working in Vienna between 1845 and 1848, Desvignes constructed a version of the machine that would help prevent banknote forgeries, as any of the nearly endless variations of roulette patterns that it could produce were extremely difficult to reverse engineer. The mathematician Bruno Abakanowicz invented a new Spirograph device between 1881 and 1900. It was used for calculating an area delimited by curves.

Drawing toys based on gears have been around since at least 1908, when The Marvelous Wondergraph was advertised in the Sears catalog. An article describing how to make a Wondergraph drawing machine appeared in the &quot;Boys Mechanic&quot; publication in 1913.

The definitive Spirograph toy was developed by the British engineer Denys Fisher between 1962 and 1964 by creating drawing machines with Meccano pieces. Fisher exhibited his spirograph at the 1965 Nuremberg International Toy Fair. It was subsequently produced by his company. US distribution rights were acquired by Kenner, Inc., which introduced it to the United States market in 1966 and promoted it as a creative children&#x27;s toy. Kenner later introduced Spirotot, Magnetic Spirograph, Spiroman, and various refill sets.

In 2013 the Spirograph brand was re-launched worldwide, with the original gears and wheels, by Kahootz Toys. The modern products use removable putty in place of pins to hold the stationary pieces in place. The Spirograph was Toy of the Year in 1967, and Toy of the Year finalist, in two categories, in 2014. Kahootz Toys was acquired by PlayMonster LLC in 2019.

==Operation==
The original US-released Spirograph consisted of two differently sized plastic rings (or stators), with gear teeth on both the inside and outside of their circumferences. Once either of these rings were held in place (either by pins, with an adhesive, or by hand) any of several provided gearwheels (or )—each having holes for a ballpoint pen—could be spun around the ring to draw geometric shapes. Later, the Super-Spirograph introduced additional shapes such as rings, triangles, and straight bars. All edges of each piece have teeth to engage any other piece; smaller gears fit inside the larger rings, but they also can rotate along the rings&#x27; outside edge or even around each other. Gears can be combined in many different arrangements. Sets often included variously colored pens, which could enhance a design by switching colors, as seen in the examples shown here.

Beginners often slip the gears, especially when using the holes near the edge of the larger wheels, resulting in broken or irregular lines. Experienced users may learn to move several pieces in relation to each other (say, the triangle around the ring, with a circle &quot;climbing&quot; from the ring onto the triangle).

==Mathematical basis==

Consider a fixed outer circle formula_1 of radius formula_2 centered at the origin. A smaller inner circle formula_3 of radius formula_4 is rolling inside formula_1 and is continuously tangent to it. formula_3 will be assumed never to slip on formula_1 (in a real Spirograph, teeth on both circles prevent such slippage). Now assume that a point formula_8 lying somewhere inside formula_3 is located a distance formula_10 from formula_3&#x27;s center. This point formula_8 corresponds to the pen-hole in the inner disk of a real Spirograph. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that at the initial moment the point formula_8 was on the formula_14 axis. In order to find the trajectory created by a Spirograph, follow point formula_8 as the inner circle is set in motion.

Now mark two points formula_16 on formula_1 and formula_18 on formula_3. The point formula_16 always indicates the location where the two circles are tangent. Point formula_18, however, will travel on formula_3, and its initial location coincides with formula_16. After setting formula_3 in motion counterclockwise around formula_1, formula_3 has a clockwise rotation with respect to its center. The distance that point formula_18 traverses on formula_3 is the same as that traversed by the tangent point formula_16 on formula_1, due to the absence of slipping.

Now define the new (relative) system of coordinates formula_31 with its origin at the center of formula_3 and its axes parallel to formula_14 and formula_34. Let the parameter formula_35 be the angle by which the tangent point formula_16 rotates on formula_1, and formula_38 be the angle by which formula_3 rotates (i.e. by which formula_18 travels) in the relative system of coordinates. Because there is no slipping, the distances traveled by formula_18 and formula_16 along their respective circles must be the same, therefore

: formula_43

or equivalently,

: formula_44

It is common to assume that a counterclockwise motion corresponds to a positive change of angle and a clockwise one to a negative change of angle. A minus sign in the above formula (formula_45) accommodates this convention.

Let formula_46 be the coordinates of the center of formula_3 in the absolute system of coordinates. Then formula_48 represents the radius of the trajectory of the center of formula_3, which (again in the absolute system) undergoes circular motion thus:

: formula_50

As defined above, formula_38 is the angle of rotation in the new relative system. Because point formula_8 obeys the usual law of circular motion, its coordinates in the new relative coordinate system formula_53 are

: formula_54

In order to obtain the trajectory of formula_8 in the absolute (old) system of coordinates, add these two motions:

: formula_56

where formula_57 is defined above.

Now, use the relation between formula_35 and formula_38 as derived above to obtain equations describing the trajectory of point formula_8 in terms of a single parameter formula_35:

: formula_62

(using the fact that function formula_63 is odd).

It is convenient to represent the equation above in terms of the radius formula_2 of formula_1 and dimensionless
parameters describing the structure of the Spirograph. Namely, let

: formula_66

and

: formula_67

The parameter formula_68 represents how far the point formula_8 is located from the center of formula_3. At the same time, formula_71 represents how big the inner circle formula_3 is with respect to the outer one formula_1.

It is now observed that

: formula_74

and therefore the trajectory equations take the form

: formula_75

Parameter formula_2 is a scaling parameter and does not affect the structure of the Spirograph. Different values of formula_2 would yield similar Spirograph drawings.

The two extreme cases formula_78 and formula_79 result in degenerate trajectories of the Spirograph. In the first extreme case, when formula_78, we have a simple circle of radius formula_2, corresponding to the case where formula_3 has been shrunk into a point. (Division by formula_78 in the formula is not a problem, since both formula_63 and formula_85 are bounded functions.)

The other extreme case formula_79 corresponds to the inner circle formula_3&#x27;s radius formula_88 matching the radius formula_2 of the outer circle formula_1, i.e. formula_91. In this case the trajectory is a single point. Intuitively, formula_3 is too large to roll inside the same-sized formula_1 without slipping.

If formula_94, then the point formula_8 is on the circumference of formula_3. In this case the trajectories are called hypocycloids and the equations above reduce to those for a hypocycloid.

<doc id="974779" wikidata="Q838970" url="?curid=974779" title="Islands (King Crimson album)">
<text>Islands is the fourth studio album by English band King Crimson, released in 3 December 1971 on the record label Island. &quot;Islands&quot; is the only studio album to feature the 1971–1972 touring line-up of Robert Fripp, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace. This would be the last album before an entirely new group (except for Fripp) would record the trilogy of &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; between 1973 and 1974. This is also the last album to feature the lyrics of co-founding member Peter Sinfield.

Musically, the album expands on the improvisational jazz leanings of King Crimson&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Lizard&quot;. It received a mixed response from critics and fans.

== Content ==

The harmonic basis for the tune &quot;The Letters&quot; is derived from the Giles, Giles and Fripp song &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Just Drop In&quot;, available on &quot;The Brondesbury Tapes&quot; compilation. The bridge section is also taken from the King Crimson version of the song, performed by the original line-up, titled simply &quot;Drop In&quot; and later released on the live album &quot;Epitaph&quot;.

The lyrics to &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; are a series of male sexual fantasies revolving around &quot;girls of the road&quot;, i.e. groupies. Lyricist Peter Sinfield later commented on the song: &quot;... everybody writes at least one groupie song. We shouldn&#x27;t. But we do. It is the ultimate sexist lyric &quot;of all time&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone taking it too seriously, because in those days you were still able to say things like &#x27;my lady&#x27; with a capital M and a capital L.&quot; [emphasis in original]

The original basis for the song &quot;Prelude: Song of the Gulls&quot; is derived from the Giles, Giles and Fripp song &quot;Suite No. 1&quot;.

The first vinyl release of the album features a hidden track. At the end of side two there is a recording of studio chatter followed by Robert Fripp saying, among other things, &quot;...What we&#x27;re going to do, umm... do it twice more, once with the oboe, once without it, and then... we finish.&quot; This was included on the initial CD release but was accidentally left off the first pressings of the 1989 Definitive Edition CD remaster. It was restored on all subsequent reissues, and has been used as &quot;walk on&quot; music for all shows starting in 2014.

Sinfield was fired by Fripp following &quot;Islands&quot;, after what the latter musician viewed as a year and a half of increasing hostility. While Sinfield believed creative tensions were essential for the creativity of the band, he has since opined that his suggestions on the band&#x27;s future being so unlike Fripp&#x27;s sowed the seeds of the discontent, saying: &quot;I think the famous &#x27;big&#x27; problems really occurred leading up to &quot;Islands&quot;, where I musically wanted to find a softer, Miles Davis-with-vocals sexy package.&quot; Over time, Sinfield has been quoted as referring to the album as &quot;my &quot;Islands&quot;&quot;, an assertion denied by Fripp who has said: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure why Peter Sinfield would consider &quot;Islands&quot; to be his album, although it became clear at the time that Peter was increasingly using KC as a vehicle for his personal ambitions, rather than a joint/group undertaking. [...] But realistically, how was &quot;Islands&quot; Peter&#x27;s album? Peter didn&#x27;t compose or play music.&quot;

===Album cover===

The original cover used in the United Kingdom and most other countries depicts the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius and displays neither the name of the band nor the title of the album. The original United States and Canadian album cover (as released by Atlantic) was the off-white Peter Sinfield painting - with coloured &quot;islands&quot; - which featured on the internal gatefold in the rest of the world. When the King Crimson catalogue was re-issued, the &quot;Trifid Nebula&quot; cover was standardised worldwide.

== Release ==

Released on 3 December 1971, &quot;Islands&quot; reached number 30 in the UK Albums Chart.

The album was re-released in 2010 as the fifth release in King Crimson&#x27;s 40th Anniversary series, featuring new stereo and 5.1 surround mixes by Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp, Sid Smith sleeve notes and extra tracks and alternative versions. The DVD-A presents a 5.1 surround sound mix by Wilson, a hi-res stereo version of the 2010 mix, a hi-res stereo version of the original album mix taken from the 30th anniversary master source and previously unreleased material, including studio takes mixed from the original recording sessions.

== Reception ==
Retrospective reviews have been mixed, with critics generally praising the band&#x27;s performances while finding the compositions and album structure aimless. AllMusic called it &quot;the weakest Crimson studio album from their first era&quot; that &quot;is only a real disappointment in relation to the extraordinarily high quality of the group&#x27;s earlier efforts.&quot; Conversely, All About Jazz described the album as a &quot;well-conceived, tremendously executed and perfectly sequenced collection&quot;, and complimented Fripp&#x27;s use of &quot;a more sophisticated jazz vernacular&quot; in a rock context.

In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (2003), Chris Dinsdale wrote that, despite being &quot;a little directionless&quot;, &quot;Islands&quot; advances the jazz-rock fusion that King Crimson last explored on side two of &quot;Lizard&quot; (1970), and comments that &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a &quot;masterful instrumental&quot; that ranks among Fripp&#x27;s finest moments. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; (1981), however, Robert Christgau criticised the album and quipped: &quot;When I feel the need for contemporary chamber music or sexist japes, &quot;jazz libre&quot; or &quot;vers ordinaire&quot;, I&#x27;ll go to the source(s).&quot; A contributor to &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) writes that the songs on &quot;Islands&quot; rank among King Crimson&#x27;s most pretentious, with the exception of &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot;, which &quot;sets its groupie-adoration lyric to a lean, edgy blues.&quot;

According to authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, &quot;Islands&quot; is &quot;very much dominated by a stately mood development&quot;, especially on &quot;Formentera Lady&quot; and the title track, a development of the Miles Davis-style use of tone first found on &quot;Bolero – The Peacock&#x27;s Tale&quot; from &quot;Lizard&quot;. In particular, &quot;Formentera Lady&quot; is described by writer Sid Smith as being reminiscent of the &quot;modal explorations of Miles Davis&#x27; &#x27;Shhh/Peaceful&#x27; on &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;.&quot; In his book &quot;A New Day Yesterday: UK Progressive Rock &amp; the 70s&quot; (2020), Mike Barnes describes &quot;Islands&quot; as &quot;another oddity, encompassing sleazy R&amp;B, pastoralia and pseudo-baroque&quot;, and deems it &quot;generally more direct than &quot;Lizards&quot;&quot;, despite expansive moments like &quot;Formentera Lady&quot;. Martin C. Strong pinpoints &quot;Islands&quot; as the third in a four album run from 1970 to 1973 in which King Crimson moved into avant-jazz territory.

<text>Andrzej Munk (16 October 1921 – 20 September 1961) was a Polish film director, screen writer and documentalist. He was one of the most influential artists of the post-Stalinist period in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. His feature films &quot;Man on the Tracks&quot; (&quot;Człowiek na torze&quot;, 1956), &quot;Eroica&quot; (&quot;Heroism&quot;, 1958), &quot;Bad Luck&quot; (&quot;Zezowate szczęście&quot;, 1960), and &quot;Passenger&quot; (&quot;Pasażerka&quot; 1963), are considered classics of the Polish Film School developed in mid-1950s. He died as a result of a car crash in Kompina in a head-on collision with a truck.

==Life==
Munk was born in Kraków in a Jewish family. Krystyna Magdalena Munk was his elder sister. Shortly before World War II (in June 1939), he graduated from a local gymnasium. During the German occupation of Poland he moved to Warsaw, where he was forced to hide. Using a false name, he worked as a construction worker. In 1944 Munk took part in the Warsaw Uprising. After the capitulation, he managed to leave the city and return to Kraków and later Kasprowy Wierch, where he started working as a janitor at the cable railway station.

After the war, Munk returned to Warsaw and joined the reopened Faculty of Architecture at the Warsaw University of Technology. Because of poor health he left the university and later studied law at Warsaw University. Finally he moved to Łódź, where he joined the Łódź Film and Theatre School. He graduated in 1951 and started working as a cameraman for the Polska Kronika Filmowa (Polish Film Chronicle). In this period Munk finished several short films and documents. In 1948 he joined the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, but in 1952 was expelled for &quot;blameworthy behaviour&quot;.

==Work==
In 1956 he finished &quot;Man on the Tracks&quot; (&quot;Człowiek na torze&quot;), one of the most important Polish films of the 1950s. The following year he started giving lectures at his alma mater. In 1957 he finished &quot;Eroica&quot;, a set of two film novels on the Polish idea of heroism and virtue. In 1960 Munk finished his third film, &quot;Bad Luck&quot; (&quot;Zezowate szczęście&quot;), a tragicomical story of a Polish everyman who always finds himself in the wrong place and in the wrong time.

Munk died in a car accident near Łowicz on 20 September 1961, while on his way home from the Auschwitz concentration camp where he was shooting &quot;Passenger&quot; (&quot;Pasażerka&quot;), released in its partially complete form in 1963.

Since 1965 the Łódź Film School awards the best debut with the &quot;Andrzej Munk Film Award&quot;. During the 2001 Biennale di Venezia a retrospective festival of his films was organized in Venice.

<doc id="974802" wikidata="Q177600" url="?curid=974802" title="Stick figure">
<text>A stick figure (also known as a stick man, stick woman, or stick person) is a very simple drawing of a human or other animal, in which the limbs (arms and legs) and torso are represented using straight lines. The head is most often represented by a circle, which can be filled or unfilled. Details such as hands, feet, and a neck may be present or absent, and the head is sometimes embellished with details such as facial features or hair. Simpler stick figures often display disproportionate physical features and ambiguous emotion.

The stick figure is a universally recognizable symbol—likely one of the most well-known in the world. Drawings of stick figures transcend language, location and demographic, and the stick figure&#x27;s roots can be traced back to over 30,000 years ago. Stick figures are often drawn by children, and their simplicity and versatility have led to their use in infographics, signage, animations, storyboards, and many other kinds of visual media.

Following the advent of the World Wide Web, the stick figure saw prominent use in Flash animation.

== History ==
The stick figure long predates modern civilisation. Stick figures were a feature of prehistoric art, and can be found in cave paintings and petroglyphs. Stick figure depictions of people, animals, and daily life have been discovered in numerous sites all over the world, such as depictions of Mimi in Australia or the Indalo in Spain. 

As language began to develop, logographies (writing systems that use images to represent words or morphemes) came to use stick figures as glyphs. In Mandaean manuscripts, uthras (celestial beings) were illustrated using stick figures.

In 1925, Austrian sociologist Otto Neurath began work on what would become the International System of Typographic Picture Education (ISOTYPE), a system of conveying warnings, statistics, and general information through standardized and easily understandable pictographs. Neurath made significant use of stick figure designs to represent individuals and statistics. In 1934, graphic designer Rudolf Modley founded Pictorial Statistics Inc., and brought ISOTYPE to the United States in 1972.

The first international use of stick figures dates back to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Pictograms created by Japanese designers Masaru Katsumi and Yoshiro Yamashita formed the basis of future pictograms. In 1972, Otto &quot;Otl&quot; Aicher designed round-ended, geometric, grid-based stick figures to be used in the signage, printed materials, and television broadcasts for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

In 1974, the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to develop the DOT pictograms, 34 (later 50) symbols for use at transportation hubs, public spaces, large events, and other contexts in which there may be great linguistic variation among those required to understand the signage. These pictograms featured stick figures heavily, drawing on previous designs, such as those made for the 1972 Summer Olympics. These symbols, or symbols derived from them, are widely used throughout the world today.

== Internet culture ==

Tom Fulp began to produce 2D stick figure animations on his Amiga computer for entertainment purposes in the early 1990s. Fulp began to work with Flash, a piece of software used to produce interactive games and animations, soon after its acquisition by Macromedia. In 1995, he created the website Newgrounds, which he used to host games he had created, such as &quot;Pico&#x27;s School&quot; (1999). Prompted by the website&#x27;s popularity, Fulp introduced a portal through which users could submit Flash animations and games of their own in 2000.

==== &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; ====

On April 19, 2001, Chinese animator Zhu Zhiqiang uploaded a 75-second-long video titled &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; on the newly formed Newgrounds animation portal, inspired by over-the-top Hong Kong martial arts films. Accompanied by bit-crushed audio samples, it shows two simple stick figures fighting with their fists and various weapons over a white background. As the fight gets increasingly intense, more tools including a bow and arrow, rocket launchers, and duplication abilities are introduced before the battle comes to a violent conclusion.

==== Other notable events (2001–2005) ====
* January 19, 2001: Animator Rob_D creates the popular series &quot;Cyanide &amp; Happiness&quot;, the first episode of Joe Zombie&#x27;s debut with more cinematic, although still very rudimentary, stickman animation. The original series lasted three episodes before being rebooted with better graphics in October.
* September 2005: The webcomic &quot;xkcd&quot;, which uses stick figures in humorous contexts often relating to science, philosophy, technology, coding and Internet culture, debuts. It is drawn and written by Randall Munroe.

==== &quot;Animator vs. Animation&quot; ====

Created by animator, YouTuber, and artist Alan Becker, the first episode of &quot;Animator vs. Animation&quot; premiered on Newgrounds on June 3, 2006, using flash animation. It showed a stick figure fighting to break out of the animation program it was created in. The video has garnered almost 80 million views since its publication. As of December 2024, the series contains eleven main episodes and a number of spin-offs, among them include the video &quot;Animation vs. Minecraft&quot;, which has gained over 305 million views as of March 2022. The Season 3 in the series of episodes features multiple styles of stick figures, including a cave painting character, a stickman similar to the one in Stickman vs. Wall, a figure seemingly from Pivot Animator, and a figure based on those in DOT pictograms. In total, all of Alan Becker&#x27;s animation videos have been watched over four and a half billion times with the vast majority of them being centered around stick figure animation.

==== Pivot Animator ====
Pivot Animator (formerly Pivot Stickfigure Animator) was created in 2005 by software developer Peter Bone. The program was specifically geared towards stick figure animation. Unlike Adobe Flash, which had grown into a highly complex 2D animation environment, Pivot Animator, with its simplicity allowed virtually anyone to create stick figure animations without requiring any form of expertise. This brought the ability to create and distribute quality stick animations to a much greater audience than before, and alongside Flash, Pivot Animator soon became another central tool for the countless Internet users who were caught up in the trend.

==== &quot;This is Bob&quot; ====
At some point between June 2008 and April 2009, an Internet copypasta began to appear featuring a Unicode stick figure named Bob. There was an initial surge in popularity in April 2009, leading to a hostile response from the YouTube community wherein the community would flag the copypasta as spam. This spread of the copypasta would reach its peak in search interest around June 2010 before declining gradually. However, on September 24, 2013, YouTube announced that they would be integrating the YouTube Comments section with Google+. In response, the YouTube community brought back the Bob copypasta in a new form, with Bob &quot;building an army&quot; against Google+. 

==== Other notable events ====
* December 24, 2008: Flipnote, another competitor to Adobe Flash and Pivot, is released. While not as popular as the aforementioned two, Flipnote does serve a role in the productions of stick figure media until the software&#x27;s termination in 2018.
* November 18, 2010: The first episode of &quot;Dick Figures&quot;, an adult animated web series created by Ed Skudder and Zack Keller, is published on YouTube by Mondo Media. The series finished with over 50 episodes and 250 million views.

=== 2017–2021: The end of Flash ===
In July 2017, Adobe Systems, which had continued to support and develop both Flash Animator and Flash Player for the past 12 years, announced that they would officially end support for the program by the end of the decade. This decision had far-reaching consequences as it entailed not only the end of development on the software but also the official end of sites that still supported Flash and the deactivation of virtually every instance of Flash player via a built-in kill switch. A number of safety issues and more versatile alternatives like HTML5 had rendered Flash obsolete.

==Unicode==

As of Unicode version 13.0, there are five stick figure characters in the Symbols for Legacy Computing block. These are in the codepoints U+1FBC5 to U+1FBC9.

OpenMoji supports the five characters along with joining character sequences to give the other figures a dress. For example, the sequence , , (🯆‍👗).

<text>Horatio King (June 21, 1811 – May 20, 1897) was Postmaster General of the United States under James Buchanan. King served as the Postmaster General for only 21 days in 1861 (February 12 to March 4), the shortest tenure in the office&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, Maine, he received a common school education, and at the age of 18 entered the office of the Paris &quot;Jeffersonian&quot;, where he learned printing, afterward becoming owner and editor of the paper. In 1833 he moved it to Portland, where he published it until 1838.

==Postal career==
In 1839 he went to Washington, D.C., having been appointed clerk in the post office department, and was gradually promoted. In 1854 he was appointed first Assistant Postmaster General during the presidency of Franklin Pierce, and in January, 1861, while acting as Postmaster General, he was questioned by a member of Congress from South Carolina with regard to the franking privilege. In his reply, King was the first to officially deny the power of a state to separate from the Union. He was then appointed Postmaster General, serving from February 12 until March 5, 1861.

==Later life==

On retiring from office, he remained in Washington, D.C., during the Civil War, serving on a board of commissioners to carry into execution the emancipation law in the District of Columbia. His efforts led to a considerable number of former slaves settling in the District.

After his retirement from office, King practiced in Washington as an attorney before the executive department and international commissions. He was active in procuring the passage of three acts in 1874, 1879, and 1885 respectively, requiring the use of the official &quot;penalty envelope,&quot; which has secured a large saving to the government. He also took an active part in the work of completing the Washington Monument, serving as secretary of the Monument Society from 1881. King was a frequent contributor to the press, and published &quot;An Oration before the Union Literary Society of Washington&quot; (Washington, D.C., 1841), and &quot;Sketches of Travel; or, Twelve Months in Europe&quot; (1878).

He was married twice. In 1846 he married Anne Collins in Maine. They had three children: Anne, Horatio Collins and Henry Franklin. After her death, he married Isabella E. Osborn in Washington in 1875. In 1881, he purchased land in West Newton, MA and built a house there on the corner of Temple and Sterling Streets which he and his wife Isabelle used as a summer residence, near the home of their son, Henry Franklin King.

King was the last surviving member of the Buchanan cabinet.

<doc id="974816" wikidata="Q33305" url="?curid=974816" title="Magar Kham language">
<text>Magar Kham (मगर खाम), also known as Kham, Kham Magar, and Khamkura, is the Sino-Tibetan language variety of the Northern Magar people of Nepal. The language is situated in the upper elevations of Baglung, East Rukum, and Rolpa districts. Based on census data taken in 2011, the total population of Magar Kham is estimated to be about 69,000 speakers.

== Language classification ==
Magar Kham is a Sino-Tibetan language, and it is classified by David Bradley as “Central Himalayan,” and as being related to Magar and Chepang and more distantly related to the Kiranti languages. George van Driem also classifies Magar Kham as “Para-Kiranti,” emphasizing that Magar Kham, Magar, and Chepang are united more by their differences from the Kiranti cluster than by their similarity to one another. Within this cluster, Magar Kham possesses a number of unique grammatical features, and shares only 44% lexical similarity with Magar and 38% with Chepang.

== Dialects ==
Magar Kham speakers generally refer to their dialect using the name of an important village or river in conjunction with the Nepali instrumental suffix [-le] or the genitive suffix [-i]. Thus, it can be said that Magar Kham has as many dialects as there are villages and rivers in their native territory. The table below presents the major dialects of the Magar Kham language as they have been classified by David E. Watters. The ISO 639-3 codes associated with each major dialect are presented in brackets.

=== Magar Kham varieties ===
At the highest level in the table, Kham has been divided into Gamal Kham, Sheshi Kham, and Parbate Kham, which is further divided into Eastern and Western Parbate Kham. As previously stated, these four major dialects are mutually unintelligible and bear unique grammatical innovations indicative of different languages. For this reason, each of these dialects have been given its own ISO 639-3 designation.

== Speakers ==
Based on the census data taken in 2011, the total population of Magar Kham speakers is estimated to be about 69,000 persons. The tables below presents the homeland population estimates by district and by dialect. It is estimated that about 15,000 Magar Kham speakers live in diaspora.

=== Magar Kham population by district ===
=== Magar Kham population by dialect/variety ===
According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;:

Estimates are based on the number of persons registering their mother tongue as either “Magar” or “Kham” within the territory of the northern Magars.

== Language vitality ==
Although their homeland is fairly homogeneous, northern Magars are multilingual. The national language of Nepali is spoken confidently by all individuals under 35 years old. In some communities (Sheshi and Eastern Parbate), parents have shifted to speaking Nepali with their children, and the speaker population is gradually decreasing. However, in all of East Rukum and in the Gam river valley of Rolpa, the language is being vigorously transmitted. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; has assigned the following EGIDS levels to each variety:
* Western Parbate Kham [kjl]: level 5 (Developing)
* Eastern Parbate Kham [kif]: level 6b (Threatened)
* Gamal Kham [kgj]: level 6a (Vigorous)
* Sheshi Kham [kip]: level 6b (Threatened)

The UNESCO Endangered Languages Project has classified Gamal Kham as &quot;Vulnerable.&quot;

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The Taka dialect of Western Parbate Kham has 22 consonant phonemes while Gamal Kham possesses around 29 to 30 consonant phonemes.

# These phonemes only appear in Ghusbang and Sheram dialect. All others appear in every Kham dialect.
# These phonemes do not occur in Parbate Kham.
# The rhotic is realized as a trill at the end of words. Otherwise, it is a flap.

===Vowels===
Taka dialect of Western Parbate has 25 vowel phonemes.
# These vowels occur in every dialect of Kham.

===Tone===

<text>Piława Górna is a town in Dzierżoniów County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, in the western part of the Wzgórza Strzelińskie hills. It lies approximately east of Dzierżoniów, and south of the regional capital Wrocław.

According to official figures for 2019, the town has a population of 6,412.

==History==
The oldest historic mention of Piława Górna comes from the 12th century under the Latin name &quot;Pilava Superius&quot;. Piława Górna was part of Piast-ruled Poland. In 1189, Bishop of Wrocław Żyrosław II granted Piława to the Knights Hospitaller from Strzegom. After Polish rule, Piława Górna passed under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Hungary, again Bohemia and the Habsburg monarchy. It was an agricultural village in Lower Silesia.

After its annexation by the Kingdom of Prussia from Austria in the First Silesian War, German settlers developed a clothing industry in the village in 1743. A settlement congregation of the Moravian Brethren was built in Piława Górna, then officially known under the Germanized name &quot;Ober-Peilau&quot;, on the estate of the Austrian noble Ernst Julius, Count von Seydlitz. Imprisoned for his Protestant faith by the Habsburg rulers of Silesia, when he was freed following the Prussian seizure of Silesia, he named the new settlement &quot;Gnadenfrei&quot; (&quot;freed by [God&#x27;s] Grace&quot;) to commemorate the event. Later on Gnadenfrei would be merged with Piława Górna. In 1842, Piława Górna had a population of 713. From 1871 to 1945 Peilau/Piława was part of Germany. It was for many years &quot;the longest village in Germany&quot;, stretching for several miles along the Piława/Peila stream.

By the beginning of the 20th century the village was almost completely German in ethnicity and Protestant in confession. During World War I, the Germans operated a POW camp for Allied officers and a forced labour camp for regular POWs in the town. In 1928, it was renamed &quot;Gnadenfrei&quot; in attempt to erase traces of Polish origin. During World War II, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men. Following the defeat of Germany in the war, the settlement became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s. The remaining German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and replaced with Roman Catholic Poles, themselves having been expelled from the Lwów (Lviv) region (now in Ukraine).

In 1962 Piława Górna was granted town privileges. From 1975 to 1998 Piława Górna was administratively located in Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

==Sights==
Architectural sights include: the Saint Martin church (built in the 16th–19th centuries), an 18th-century palace complex and the Educational Centre building from the 19th century.

==Economy==
Weaving mills and quarries were located in the vicinity of Piława Górna by the 14th century; the former state textile firm and quarry still exists in the town. In 2002 Piława Górna had 120 stone-working businesses, 27 textile businesses of various kinds, 172 trade companies, and 157 service industries. The agricultural industry is based on local farming and consists of 115 small businesses which mostly grow sugar beets, rapeseed, and grains.

In order to promote tourism in the region, Piława Górna engages in agritourism.

<text>Old School is a 2003 American comedy film directed and co-written by Todd Phillips. The film stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as depressed men in their thirties who seek to relive their college days by starting a fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so. The film was released on February 21, 2003, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $87 million worldwide.

==Plot==

Returning home early from a business trip, real estate attorney Mitch Martin walks in on his girlfriend Heidi hosting an orgy and breaks up with her. At his friend Frank&#x27;s wedding, Mitch makes an awkward impression on his high school crush, Nicole, and soon moves into a house near Harrison University campus in upstate New York.

Mitch&#x27;s friend Bernard throws a hugely successful housewarming party dubbed Mitch-A-Palooza. A drunken Frank is seen streaking by his wife Marissa and her friends, straining their new marriage, while Mitch wakes up in bed with Darcie, a young woman he later learns is his boss&#x27; daughter and a high school senior. Kicked out by Marissa after an unfortunate couple&#x27;s therapy session, Frank moves in with Mitch.

The friends are visited by an acquaintance they used to ridicule: Gordon Pritchard, now the college dean, who has had the house rezoned exclusively for campus housing. Exploiting a university loophole, Bernard turns the house into a fraternity open to anyone, and the friends carry out hazing events throughout campus, much to Pritchard&#x27;s displeasure.

Mitch walks in on Nicole&#x27;s boyfriend, Mark, kissing a woman at a birthday party for one of Bernard&#x27;s children. Elderly World War II-veteran fraternity brother Blue dies of a heart attack during a &quot;KY lube wrestling&quot; match with two college girls at his birthday celebration, and Marissa asks Frank for a divorce.

Pritchard bribes student council president Megan Huang, promising to get her into Columbia Law School in exchange for revoking the fraternity&#x27;s charter. Nicole confronts Mitch after Mark lies that he caught Mitch with the woman at the party instead, and a run-in with Darcie complicates Mitch&#x27;s attempt to explain. Pritchard has the fraternity evicted, placing the students in the now unsanctioned fraternity at risk of expulsion.

Mitch determines they can bypass Pritchard&#x27;s ruling if all members complete various assessments to prove their legitimacy. Frank defeats James Carville in a debate session, and the fraternity cheats their way through an exam with the help of Mitch&#x27;s co-workers. In the school spirit evaluation, the fraternity loses points when Frank, dressed as the school mascot, unsuccessfully jumps through a ring of fire.

Megan confronts Pritchard for reneging their deal, and the fraternity faces their final athletics challenge. A badly burned Frank gives an intense rhythmic gymnastics performance, Bernard manages to complete the rings routine, and Weensie, an obese member chosen by Pritchard, executes a perfect vault landing. The fraternity triumphs, but Pritchard gives them a failing score by accounting for the absence of the late Blue. Megan provides a tape recording of Pritchard admitting to bribery, and after a chase across campus, Frank recovers the tape.

Pritchard is fired, and the fraternity&#x27;s charter is reinstated. They move into Pritchard&#x27;s former residence. Nicole visits Mitch as he leaves the old fraternity house, revealing that she dumped Mark after catching him cheating. They reconcile, Mitch and Bernard returning to their everyday lives while Frank assumes fraternity leadership.

In a mid-credits scene, Mark drives off a bridge and lands on a fly-fishing Pritchard as the car explodes. Frank meets Heidi, who invites him to a &quot;get-together,&quot; and he enthusiastically accepts.

==Cast==
==Production==
At the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Todd Phillips premiered the documentary &quot;Frat House&quot; to acclaim, winning the Grand Jury Prize in the Documentary category with co-director Andrew Gurland. Ivan Reitman, who had produced the fraternity house comedy &quot;Animal House&quot;, saw the documentary and wanted to collaborate with Phillips to revive the frat comedy film genre. The first film from Reitman and Phillips’s partnership was the 2000 comedy &quot;Road Trip&quot;, which was also the first collaboration between screenwriter Scot Armstrong and Phillips. The success of &quot;Road Trip&quot; prompted Armstrong and Phillips to pitch Reitman on a fraternity-themed film centered around adult men instead of the usual college-aged kids. Said Armstrong, &quot;There&#x27;s a weird brotherhood that happens when you&#x27;re in college were you&#x27;re kind of finding yourself, and it was funny to think of old people doing it.&quot;

&quot;Old School&quot; was filmed in and around La Crescenta, California from January 7, 2002 until March 18, 2002. Filming locations included Palisades High School, UCLA, USC and Harvard University. The film is considered a forerunner to the Frat Pack since three of its stars—Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson—are core members of that group.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Old School&quot; received mixed to positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 167 critics, with an average score of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;While not consistently funny, the movie does have its moments.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on a scale of A to F.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;sloppy, dumb, though occasionally funny comedy,&quot; comparing it to &quot;a half-empty glass of Coke that&#x27;s been sitting out for a couple of days; sure, it looks like cola, but one sip tells you exactly what&#x27;s missing.&quot; He called out both Phillips and co-executive producer Ivan Reitman for rehashing their previous works and accused the latter of self-plagiarism by saying that the film was &quot;so derivative of &quot;Animal House&quot; (and, more specifically, its children) that it&#x27;s like one of those by-the-numbers imitative movies Homer Simpson is so obsessed with.&quot; Mitchell added that Phillips &quot;comes even closer than Mr. Reitman to stealing from himself.&quot; Mitchell praised Ferrell for using &quot;his hilarious, anxious zealotry to sell the part&quot; and Cuthbert who &quot;hijacks the handful of scenes she has.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film one out of four stars and stated, &quot;This is not a funny movie, although it has a few good scenes and some nice work by Ferrell as an apparently compulsive nudist.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;This year&#x27;s kinder, gentler &quot;Animal House&quot;.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $17,453,216 in 2,689 theaters in its opening weekend at the U.S. box office, opening at #2 behind &quot;Daredevil&quot; which was on its second week at the top spot. &quot;Old School&quot; grossed receipts of $75,585,093 in the U.S. and Canada and $11,550,427 in international markets for a total of $87,135,520 worldwide.

===Awards===

* Artios Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Casting for Feature Film
* MTV Movie Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Comedic Performance (for Will Ferrell, losing to Mike Myers for &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;) and for Best On-Screen Team (Ferrell, Vaughn, Wilson)
* Taurus Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Fire Stunt
* Spike Guys&#x27; Choice Awards (2012) - won for Guy Movie Hall of Fame

==Home media==
&quot;Old School&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in both rated and unrated versions on June 10, 2003 by DreamWorks Home Entertainment. The unrated Blu-ray was released on December 16, 2008.

==Soundtrack==
At the Mitch-a-palooza party, Snoop Dogg and Kokane perform &quot;Paper&#x27;d Up&quot;, sampling Eric B &amp; Rakim&#x27;s track &quot;Paid in Full&quot;. The soundtrack also includes &quot;Fun Night&quot; by Andrew W.K., &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; by Kansas, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Farmer in the Dell&quot;, &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot;, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by Black Flag, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; Gone Bad&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica, &quot;Playground in My Mind&quot; by Clint Holmes and &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. The main song in this movie is &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; by Whitesnake, which is played when Will Ferrell&#x27;s character is fixing his car and in the closing credits. Also, The Dan Band sings one of the famous songs of Bonnie Tyler, &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; (with some interesting improvisational departures as to the cover&#x27;s lyrics), and Styx&#x27;s &quot;Lady&quot;. During the introductory sequence Ryan Adams&#x27; &quot;To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)&quot;, co-written with David Rawlings, can be heard most memorably during the metal detector scene.

==Canceled sequel==
In 2006, a sequel, titled &quot;Old School Dos&quot;, was written by Scot Armstrong but was turned down by original stars, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. The story concerned the aging fraternity going to spring break. While promoting &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; in 2008, Ferrell had this to say about the defunct project: &quot;I read [the script]. Some super funny set pieces, but I don&#x27;t know. I think Vince [Vaughn] had the same reaction. We’re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us going to Spring Break, but we’ve got to find this guy who&#x27;s the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it&#x27;s just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating. But watch, I&#x27;m over-thinking it.&quot;

<doc id="974846" wikidata="Q925253" url="?curid=974846" title="Mortal Kombat 3">
<text>Mortal Kombat 3 is a 1995 fighting game developed and published by Midway Games for arcades. It is the third main installment in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise and a sequel to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm.

The third installment of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; retains the blood and gory attacks that defined the series. It introduces new types of Fatality finishing moves, including Animalities. Other features new to the series are combos, predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks. The new &quot;Run&quot; button allows players to briefly dash toward the opponent, and the new &quot;Kombat Kodes&quot; system allows players to enter various symbols before two-player matches to unlock certain additional features of the game.

&quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was a commercial success and received generally positive reviews, but drew criticism for omitting several popular characters from previous games. It is the only main installment to not feature franchise mascot Scorpion. Characters omitted from this game were included in the two titles produced to update it, &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; (1996).

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; builds further on the gameplay of the previous game. A &quot;Run&quot; button, accompanied by a corresponding meter, was introduced. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. The Run meter is drained both by running (the character cannot run backward, only forwards) and by performing combos.

&quot;Chain combos&quot;, also known as pre-programmed combos (labeled &quot;dial-a-combos&quot;) were also introduced. Chain combos are button sequences that cannot be interrupted once one hit connects; some chain combos end with an uppercut or another move that knocks the opponent into the air so that more damage can be dealt via a traditional juggle combo. To please players of various skill levels, a &quot;Choose Your Destiny&quot; screen appears in the single-player mode to allow player-selectable difficulty.

For the first time, certain levels were interactive by allowing characters to uppercut each other through the ceiling where both characters would continue the battle in a different stage. This could alter the game&#x27;s level cycle. Both normal uppercuts and uppercuts that are part of a ground combo would result in a level change. Kung Lao&#x27;s &quot;Whirl Wind Spin&quot; move would also have the same effect. However, if the character is defeated by an uppercut, there is no level change.

All of the different styles of finishing moves featured in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (Fatalities, including the non-lethal Babality and Friendship moves) return in &quot;MK3&quot;. Additionally, Animalities, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent, are featured for the first time. To perform an Animality, the player must first perform a Mercy, another new feature where the character can restore a tiny amount of their opponent&#x27;s health bar after winning two rounds. If the opponent is defeated again, an Animality can be performed. Finally, three new Stage Fatalities can be performed in the Subway, the Bell Tower and the Pit 3.

Another concept introduced in this game is the &quot;Kombat Kode&quot;, a six-symbol code entered at the VS screen in a two-player game to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain messages. Also introduced in this game was the &quot;Ultimate Kombat Kode&quot;, a 10-character code using symbols, that could be entered on the game over screen after the continue screen disappears in single player mode. It was used to unlock a robotic version of the character Smoke; it can be done by either the player or the arcade operator. The arcade owner could reset this code by accessing the game&#x27;s diagnostic menu and resetting the game to the factory settings within the &quot;MK3&quot; cabinet (except in version 2.1, which can only be done by accessing the EJB menu). The codes were revealed through gaming magazines, promotional material, and other &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; media; three pinball machines released around this time by Williams/Bally/Midway, &quot;Jack-Bot&quot;, &quot;No Fear: Dangerous Sports&quot;, and &quot;Theatre of Magic&quot;, also provided codes, and some of the text messages in this game were intended to lead players to the hidden codes in those games.

==Plot==
Weary of continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament in the previous game, enacts a 10,000-year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she would not be revived in the Outworld, but in Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen. When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her and, as a result, Earthrealm gradually becomes a part of Outworld, stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, protected by Raiden. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld. Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to kill any Earthrealm survivors. Also, Raiden&#x27;s protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. With his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm is restored.

The game also contains several subplots:
* Having defeated Shao Kahn in Outworld, Liu Kang now finds himself as the prime target of Shao Kahn&#x27;s extermination squads. In response to the upcoming threat, he aligns himself with Kung Lao and leads the rebellion against Shao Kahn and his Outworld minions. However, he also has an ulterior motive: he seeks to free Kitana&#x27;s home realm of Edenia.
* With the latest advancements in human technologies, the Lin Kuei decide to automate their human assassins into soulless machines. Four ninjas, Cyrax, Sektor, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, are selected to serve as the first automation prototypes, but Sub-Zero and Smoke refuse to participate, forcing them to leave the clan. Unfortunately, Smoke is captured and is automated along with Sektor and Cyrax and all three are programmed to hunt down and kill Sub-Zero. Meanwhile, learning of the looming Outworld threat, Sub-Zero joins the rebellion against Shao Kahn.
* Jax discovers the location of both Sonya and Kano while in Outworld and, in freeing Sonya, he also frees Kano. Knowing that his near future means arrest, Kano uses this opportunity to escape into the depths of Outworld and ultimately joins Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces. Sonya and Jax return to Earth and try to warn their government about the looming Outworld threat, but when their pleas are ignored, Sonya and Jax instead prepare themselves for the upcoming war by joining the rebellion.
* Despite both serving Shao Kahn, the Centaurians and Shokan have been at war with each other for years. Suspicions arise when Sheeva, who is appointed Sindel&#x27;s bodyguard, learns that Motaro is appointed as Kahn&#x27;s general in his armies. With the apparent, yet unconfirmed, &quot;deaths&quot; of both Kintaro and Goro, Sheeva begins to fear for her own race and makes plans to turn against Kahn should her suspicions prove to be true.
* Largely dependent on a respirator and an undying thirst for revenge against the Black Dragon clan (who he believes was responsible for his brutal attack), Kabal joins the rebellion upon learning of Kano&#x27;s survival.
* Though he realizes that he is the lone survivor of New York City following the Outworld Invasion, Stryker remains ignorant as to why he survived the attack. However, upon receiving a vision from Raiden and being informed of what has transpired, Stryker decides to find and join the other Earthrealm warriors.
* For many years, Nightwolf received visions that foretold and warned him of the upcoming invasion. Largely ignoring them, he feels guilty for not preventing it, and so joins the human offensive against Kahn by casting a magical protection over his ancestors&#x27; traditional homeland in North America. This region becomes a threat to Kahn&#x27;s occupation of Earth.
* Johnny Cage was hunted down by one of Shao Kahn&#x27;s extermination squads and killed, apparently by Motaro.

==Development==
The development team considered making &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; using 3D graphics, but opted to stick with the sprite graphics of the previous games.

The game has a different tone overall than its predecessors and uses a noticeably more muted color palette. Characters were heavily digitized, as opposed to the hybrid digitized/hand-drawn style of &quot;MKII&quot;. Many of the game&#x27;s backgrounds were created using pre-rendered 3D graphics for the first time. Its overall style was also differentiated from the previous &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games; instead of the heavy ancient East Asian influences the first two games had, the imagery of &quot;MK3&quot; is more Western and contemporary: the game&#x27;s stages are set in modern locations such as urban highways, bank buildings, and rooftops; three of the characters are cyborgs; and traditional martial art clothing designs, such as Sub-Zero&#x27;s garb, have been replaced by modern clothing. This change is also reflected in the soundtrack, in which all Asian motifs have been dropped in favor of electronic music instrumentation.

Some of the characters from previous &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games who returned in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; were portrayed by new actors since their original portrayers left Midway due to royalty disputes over the use of their likenesses in console versions. Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang in the first two games, as well as Shang Tsung in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;), Phillip Ahn (Shang Tsung in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) and Daniel Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke/Noob Saibot) were not involved in the production of &quot;MK3&quot;. Prior to the release of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, Daniel appeared in an advertisement for another fighting game, &quot;BloodStorm&quot;, which resulted in a false rumor that it got him fired by Midway. All this led to the use of new actors for Liu Kang (Eddie Wong), Sonya Blade (Kerri Hoskins), and Shang Tsung and Sub-Zero (both played by John Turk) in &quot;MK3&quot;. Richard Divizio (Kano) also took over the role of Noob Saibot (as the character was a recolored Kano in this version). Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in the first two games, did not appear in &quot;MK3&quot; as a penalty for his involvement in the rival game &quot;BloodStorm&quot;, but was still employed by Midway and his character would return in &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, although through the use of recycled sprites from &quot;MKII&quot; and new sprites performed by Sal Divita.

==Release==
Accompanied by a massive promotional campaign (given the world record for the &quot;largest promotional campaign for a video game&quot; in the 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;), &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was originally released to the North American arcades in April 1995. The game was soon ported to three home consoles, namely the Genesis, Super NES, and PlayStation. The PlayStation version was described as identical to the arcade original by Ed Boon. As part of a deal with Midway, Sony Computer Entertainment gained exclusive worldwide rights for the 32-bit version of the game up through the end of the first quarter of 1996 (hence why the Sega Saturn, 3DO, and Atari Jaguar versions were all slated for release in the second quarter of 1996). According to a Sega spokesperson, Sony paid Midway $12 million for these timed exclusive rights. Continuing a tradition of simultaneous home version releases from the first two games in the series, it was announced that the Genesis, Super NES, Game Boy, and Game Gear versions would all be released on &quot;Mortal Friday&quot;, October 13, 1995. However, not all of the versions made the planned date, and the Game Gear version was never released in North America at all. The publishing for the 16-bit console ports and portable versions in North America was handled by Williams Entertainment, rather than Acclaim Entertainment (who handled the console ports of the previous titles), although Acclaim still handled the publishing for &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; in Europe. Although Sculptured Software did the 16-bit and DOS versions, the PlayStation and PC versions were developed by its San Diego development division Leland Interactive Media, which Midway&#x27;s owner WMS Industries had bought the previous year.

On the Game Boy, only nine of the original 15 fighters (Kano, Sonya, Sub-Zero, Cyrax, Sektor, Sheeva, Sindel, Kabal, and Smoke) are available, only five stages exist, there are no button-link combos, and no finishers outside of Fatalities and Babalities. Shao Kahn uses his moves from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, and Motaro is not included. The sole Game Boy game to be rated M by the ESRB, this version does not include much of the overt gore and violence seen in its parent systems but kept some of the &quot;burning&quot; Fatalities (immolating a defeated opponent down to a burnt skeleton).

A scaled-down Game Gear version of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was released only in Europe. It is very similar to the Game Boy version, although it is in color and features Noob Saibot as a hidden character. It is the only Game Gear &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game to not have blood and gore. There is also a port for the Master System, which is nearly identical to the Game Gear version with the addition of blood and a wider view of the stage and fighters, although it was only released in Brazil by Tec Toy, distributor of Sega&#x27;s products in that country.

There are two different versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; for IBM PC compatibles. The first is an MS-DOS version, which does not closely resemble any of the other ports. This version contains a hidden redbook audio track () with a narration of a story in reverse. The second is a port of the PlayStation version to Microsoft Windows.

&quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was originally slated to be released for the Atari Jaguar in the second quarter of 1996, according to a joint press release issued by Atari and Williams Entertainment on March 13, 1995, but was never released. A port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was also announced for an early 1996 release, touted on magazine covers, and reportedly complete, but was also never released. A port for the Sega Saturn was also announced for early 1996, but was canceled in favor of a port of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;.

&quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; is also included in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox; &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition&quot; for the Windows (this title includes a &#x27;making of&#x27; documentary about the game); and &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for the PlayStation Portable.

In 2021, Mortal Kombat 3 was re-released by Arcade1Up along with Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on one of their Countercades.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first Mortal Kombat game, Arcade1Up released in 2022 an arcade machine with Mortal Kombat 3 along with Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Toobin&#x27;, Rampage, Joust, Tapper, Wizard of Wor, Gauntlet, Defender, Bubbles, Paperboy and Klax.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
In the United States, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; to be the most-popular arcade game in May 1995. &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was one of three 1995 recipients of the American Amusement Machine Association&#x27;s Diamond Awards (which are based strictly on sales achievements), along with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo MVS. It was the highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1995 in the United States.

Williams Entertainment, which published the Super NES and Genesis versions, reported combined sales of 250,000 copies in the first weekend they were available, placing them among the best-selling games of 1995. The Super NES version had sold more than one million copies by November 23, 1995. It went on to be the best-selling home video game of 1995 in the United States. &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was nominated for the Video Software Dealers Association&#x27;s &quot;Video Game of the Year&quot; for 1995, losing to &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot;.

===Critical===

Although &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was commercially successful, many disliked the inclusion of arguably less-appealing new characters (especially Stryker) in place of established stalwarts such as Scorpion and Kitana. The new combo system was also often criticized, as were, to a lesser degree, the run mechanics and some finishing moves. According to &quot;PC Gamer&quot; in 1998, &quot;While &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot; managed to improve upon the fast-paced, gore-galore formula of the original, the third incarnation didn&#x27;t fare nearly as well. &quot;MK3&quot; suffered from monkeywrenched gameplay, needlessly stupid finishing moves like &#x27;Animalities,&#x27; and unbearably campy character designs.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, and stated that &quot;in an industry which depends on innovation to keep it fresh and interesting, &quot;MK III&quot; just doesn&#x27;t deliver.&quot; A &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; article on the history of the series stated in 2007: &quot;Although many hardcore fans will decree Midway&#x27;s third &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game to be the best in the series, just as many felt it was beginning of the end for the still massively popular franchise ... While Midway had been constantly adding subtle gameplay tweaks to its franchise since the release of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, its once exciting series was suddenly looking rather tired.&quot;

Nevertheless, the game received largely positive reviews at the time. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) gave the PlayStation version their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. &quot;EGM&quot; and IGN both criticized the heavy lag during Shang Tsung&#x27;s morphing while assessing the conversion overall as a near-perfect replication of the graphics, content, and controls of the arcade original. However, IGN gave it a negative assessment based on the shortcomings of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; itself, recommending &quot;Street Fighter&quot; 2D fighting games over it unless one is a &quot;die-hard &quot;MK&quot; fan&quot;. According to a later IGN retrospective, &quot;Despite the evolutions in gameplay, &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was simply not met with same kind of enthusiasm as its predecessor. While the new &#x27;cyber-ninja&#x27; characters were popular, the loss of so many favorites from the roster left many players feeling left out. A new &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was impossible to ignore, but the response wasn&#x27;t quite what Midway had hoped for.&quot;

Reviewing the Genesis version, a &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic remarked that the game actually looks better on a last-generation console, where it finds company with other 2D games and is better-looking than most of them, than it did in the arcade, where it seemed outdated against the increasingly prevalent polygon-based games. He complimented the game for delivering on the elements most important to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fanbase, but added as a final note that &quot;as a whole, the &quot;MK&quot; series is getting stale and in dire need of some major reworking.&quot; In their review, &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly said that &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; is &quot;just not original enough (like &quot;Tekken&quot;) or deep enough (like SF [&quot;Street Fighter&quot;]) to warrant space on the casual Genesis gamer&#x27;s shelf.&quot; They also criticized the Genesis version as being a weak approximation of the arcade version, particularly the character sprites and sound effects. They assessed the PlayStation version as a much more accurate conversion aside from the lag during Shang Tsung&#x27;s morphing, but concluded it to be &quot;An awesome home version of a game that wasn&#x27;t so great to begin with.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly felt the arcade-perfect quality of the PlayStation version was overshadowed by the game&#x27;s lack of innovation: &quot;There is little, outside of a few new, conspicuously uninspired characters, a run feature, and a new combo system, which simply mirrors its competition, to differentiate &quot;MK3&quot; from its predecessors.&quot; &quot;Maximum&quot; praised the PlayStation version&#x27;s wealth of customization options and &quot;eerie combat music tracks&quot;, but remarked that the game was outdated with &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; already out in arcades and slated for release on the Saturn. They also took strong issue with the lack of PAL optimization, saying that as a result &quot;The characters move very slowly as if wading through treacle, and this detracts from the overall feel of the game as well as changing the timing for the special moves and combos.&quot;

Reviewing the SNES version, the four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; concurred it to be by far the best &quot;16-bit version&quot; of the game. They especially praised the challenging enemy AI, accurate graphics, and high number of special options. While they listed some problems with the AI and sound, &quot;GamePro&quot; had a similar reaction, concluding that &quot;Converting a mammoth arcade game like &quot;MK 3&quot; to the 16-bit Super NES is no easy task, and Williams has done a respectable job of keeping all the key elements intact.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer&quot; itself, despite the later negative opinion, gave the PC version of &quot;MK3&quot; a review score of 89% upon the release, calling it &quot;yet another excellent arcade experience from the king of fighting games.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; at the time called it &quot;one of the best fighting games ever released for the PC&quot; and &quot;a title you must own&quot; for the fans of the genre, awarding it four out of five stars. &quot;GamePro&quot; panned the Game Boy version in a brief review, venturing that &quot;even portable power players will find the soft controls and eye-straining graphics unbearable.&quot; In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the Mega Drive version as the best game for the system. In the same issue, GamesMaster rated the SNES version 5th in its &quot;The GamesMaster SNES Top 10.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was released to arcades in 1995. It is an update of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, featuring altered gameplay, additional characters, and new arenas. Various home versions of the game were released soon afterward, although none of these were completely identical to the arcade version. Several more home versions followed between 2002 and 2010, including &quot;Mortal Kombat Advance&quot; for the Game Boy Advance and &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat&quot; for the Nintendo DS. The DS version features the &quot;Puzzle Kombat&quot; minigame originally from &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; itself was updated to include content from previous games in the series and serve as the basis for the console-exclusive title &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; in 1996. It was also remastered to be released as part of the &quot;Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection&quot; in 2011.

Plot elements from the game were used in the 1997 film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, the sequel to the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film adaptation.

<text>Snuff the Punk is the debut studio album by Christian nu metal band P.O.D. The album was released on January 25, 1994, on Rescue Records, which was owned by Noah Bernardo, Sr (band members Sonny Sandoval&#x27;s uncle and Wuv Bernardo&#x27;s father). It was remixed, remastered and re-released with new artwork by indie label Diamante in 1999. The original cover showed a cartoon character with a gun, but the re-released album cover issued a censored cover art with this illustration removed.

==Legacy==
In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Snuff the Punk&quot; at number 22 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; noted that the album is one of the earliest nu metal albums, comparable to Korn&#x27;s self-titled; which was released the same year.

==Track listing==

<doc id="974853" wikidata="Q49386" url="?curid=974853" title="Mercedes-Benz B-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz B-Class is a subcompact executive car manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz since 2005. Based on the A-Class with larger dimensions, the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) classifies it as a small MPV.

Mercedes-Benz had presented a concept car Vision B &quot;Compact Sports Tourer&quot; at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. The concept previewed some features that would be available on the production B-Class. The &quot;Vision B&quot; was based on the layered platform, so that the drivetrain would be placed partly in front of and underneath the passengers.

As of December 20, 2013, delivery of B-Class vehicles reached 1 million sales worldwide since its launch in 2005.

==First generation (W245; 2005)==

The first-generation B-Class was introduced in Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world in spring 2005, and in Canada in autumn 2005. It was marketed globally except in the United States, where it was unable to price match the vehicle for profit. The B-Class uses front-wheel drive with sandwich floor construction, parabolic rear suspension, and a two-box design — one for the drivetrain and another for the shared passenger and luggage compartment. The B-Class maximises its interior volume via its height. Having derived from the smaller A-Class, it retained that car&#x27;s sandwich floor concept.

All models included passive automobile safety systems including ESP, ABS, traction control, cornering lights, active lighting system, and headlamp assist. In the event of a frontal impact the engine and transmission slide beneath the passenger compartment.

In 2008, it was updated with a start-stop system and a BlueEFFICIENCY option. A new NGT variant was added, which could burn either gasoline or natural gas.

In 2011, Mercedes-Benz did a world tour with three of its Mercedes-Benz F-Cell vehicles, one of which was the B-Class. The hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle was driven more than 30,000 kilometres in a circumnavigation of the globe, starting and ending in Stuttgart.

===Pre-facelift===
===Facelift===
=== Engines ===
The B160 and B180 conform to Euro V emission standards. The rest of the engines conform to Euro IV emission standards. A diesel particulate filter is available as an option for the diesel units (this reduces about 99% of the particle emissions, without the need for additives).

=== Specifications ===
== Second generation (W246; 2011) ==
The W246 was revealed in August 2011, and made its public debut in September 2011 at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany. It was announced that the B-Class would come standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, as well as an optional 7G-Tronic automatic. The start/stop technology was standard on all models.

Mass production of the B-Class started in November 2011 at the Rastatt plant in Germany. Additionally, the B-Class was the first vehicle to use the MFA platform.

Safety features include seven to nine airbags, hill-start assist, driver drowsiness detection, tyre pressure monitoring, Pre-Safe system that will tighten seatbelts, and a system that will automatically close the windows and the sunroof if the systems detect an approaching accident. Other safety systems include anti-lock braking (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC), and brake assistant (BA).

The B-Class Electric Drive was introduced to the U.S. in December 2013 as an early 2014 model. It is one of the only B-Class models to ever be sold in the U.S. market, as well as being the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to ever be offered in an electric variant, though it was only available in certain states that required ZEV mandates. It was originally rebadged as the B-Class Electric Drive, but in 2017, it was renamed the B250e.

===Gallery===
== Third generation (W247; 2019) ==

The third generation B-Class was launched at the Paris Motor Show on 2 October 2018. At launch, the vehicle was claimed to feature the Intelligent Drive semi-automated driving system borrowed from the S-Class.

The design was improved with a much shorter front overhang. The controversial sculpting on the side part of the vehicle was not carried over to the W247 B-Class. Three infotainment system options is available, with entry-level models getting dual seven-inch displays. A seven-inch display with the larger 10.25-inch display is available, with top-tier models getting a pair of the large displays. It is powered by a full MBUX infotainment system, giving B-Class buyers access to its functions through a standard touchscreen. Features such as intelligent voice control, augmented reality, and a head-up display are optional. The all-electric configuration was removed, but a plug-in hybrid option was introduced. The plug-in hybrid comes with a 10.9 kWh battery which optionally supports DC charging and provides a WLTP combined cycle range of 66 km.


===2023 facelift===
In 2022, the B-Class had received a facelift for the 2023 model year. With close resemblance to the W177 update, the B-Class includes minor differences to the headlights with significant changes to the taillights, along with a changed interior, and improved infotainment adding the newest iteration of the Mercedes-Benz MBUX system. It also removed the manual transmission, alongside the A-Class and CLA as part of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s plan to retire manual transmissions.

===Engines===
The hatchback has slightly updated models from pre-facelift and facelift. The AWD models uses Mercedes’ four-wheel drive technology called ‘4Matic’, and with the facelift, petrol models use a 48-volt mild hybrid system.

<doc id="974859" wikidata="Q5425519" url="?curid=974859" title="FHA insured loan">
<text>An FHA insured loan is a US Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance backed mortgage loan that is provided by an FHA-approved lender. FHA mortgage insurance protects lenders against losses. They have historically allowed lower-income Americans to borrow money to purchase a home that they would not otherwise be able to afford. Because this type of loan is more geared towards new house owners than real estate investors, FHA loans are different from conventional loans in the sense that the house must be owner-occupant for at least a year. Since loans with lower down-payments usually involve more risk to the lender, the home-buyer must pay a two-part mortgage insurance that involves a one-time bulk payment and a monthly payment to compensate for the increased risk. Frequently, individuals &quot;refinance&quot; or replace their FHA loan to remove their monthly mortgage insurance premium. Removing mortgage insurance premium by paying down the loan has become more difficult with FHA loans as of 2013.

The program originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s when the rates of foreclosures and defaults rose sharply, and the program was intended to provide lenders with sufficient insurance. The government subsidized some FHA programs, but the goal was to make it self-supporting based on borrowers&#x27; insurance premiums. Over time, private mortgage insurance (PMI) companies came into play. Now FHA primarily serves people who cannot afford a conventional down payment or do not qualify for PMI. The program has since this time been modified to accommodate the heightened recession.

==History==
The National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which was established primarily to increase home construction, reduce unemployment, and operate various loan insurance programs. The FHA makes no loans, nor does it plan or build houses. As in the Veterans Administration&#x27;s VA loan program, the applicant for the loan must make arrangements with a lending institution. This financial organization then may ask if the borrower wants FHA insurance on the loan or may insist that the borrower apply for it. Through the Federal Housing Administration, the federal government investigates the applicant and, having decided that the risk is favorable, insures the lending institution against loss of principal in case the borrower fails to meet the terms and conditions of the mortgage. The borrower, who pays an insurance premium of 0.5% on declining balances for the lender&#x27;s protection, receives two benefits: a careful appraisal by an FHA inspector and a lower interest rate on the mortgage than the lender might have offered without the protection. In some states, the FHA inspection may be waived for smaller FHA loans, usually those not exceeding $30,000.

African Americans and other racial minorities were largely denied access to FHA-backed loans, especially before 1950, and only gained access in a handful of suburban developments specifically built for all-black occupancy. Under the Eisenhower Administration, FHA tried to coax private developers to build more housing for minority buyers. This was done through its Voluntary Home Credit Mortgage Program. However, less housing was built under the program than expected, and FHA refused to deny insurance to developers who discriminated. The way FHA-backed loans were administered contributed to widening homeownership and racial wealth gap, even as they helped to build the white middle-class family.

Until the latter half of the 1960s, the Federal Housing Administration served mainly as an insuring agency for loans made by private lenders. However, in recent years this role has been expanded as the agency became the administrator of interest rate subsidy and rent supplement programs. Important subsidy programs such as the Civil Rights Act of 1968 were established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

In 1974 the Housing and Community Development Act was passed. Its provisions significantly altered federal involvement in a wide range of housing and community development activities. The new law made a variety of changes in FHA activities, although it did not involve (as had been proposed) a complete rewriting and consolidation of the National Housing Act. However, it did include provisions relating to the lending and investment powers of federal savings and loan associations, the real estate lending authority of national banks, and the lending and depositary authority of federal credit unions.

Further changes occurred in the 1977 Housing and Community Development Act, which raised ceilings on single-family loan amounts for savings and loan association lending, federal agency purchases, FHA insurance, and security for Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In 1980 the Housing and Community Development Act was passed; it permitted negotiated interest rates on certain FHA loans and created a new FHA rental subsidy program for middle-income families.

On August 31, 2007, the FHA added a new refinancing program called FHA-Secure to help borrowers hurt by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.

On March 6, 2008, the &quot;FHA Forward&quot; program was initiated. This is the part of the stimulus package that President George W. Bush had in place to raise the lending limits for each county in every state..

On April 1, 2012, the FHA enacted a new rule that requires their customers to settle with medical creditors in order to get a mortgage loan. This controversial change was rescinded and postponed until July 2012, but was later cancelled altogether pending clarification and additional guidance. By November 2012, the FHA was essentially bankrupt.

==FHA loan application process==
The FHA does not make loans. Rather, it insures loans made by private lenders. The first step in obtaining an FHA loan is to contact several lenders and/or mortgage brokers and ask them if they are FHA-Approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to originate FHA loans. Except in certain situations, it is also not possible to have two or more FHA loans at the same time.

Second, the potential lender assesses the prospective home buyer for risk. The analysis of one&#x27;s debt-to-income ratio enables the buyer to know what type of home can be afforded based on monthly income and expenses and is one risk metric considered by the lender. Other factors, e.g. payment history on other debts, are considered and used to make decisions regarding eligibility and terms for a loan. FHA loans require a minimum FICO score of 580 to qualify for 3.5% down or 500 for 10% down. Additionally, the lender checks the financial history of the person getting the loan to see whether they have been delinquent on loans owed to the U.S. government; if they are, they do not qualify for a FHA loan.

FHA approved lenders use a program called Desktop Underwriter also known as DU for mortgage approval. DU considers the potential borrower&#x27;s debt ratio, reserves and credit score to make an automated credit decision.

The FHA makes provisions for home buyers who have recovered from &quot;economic events&quot;. Via the Back To Work - Extenuating Circumstances program, the FHA reduces its standard, mandatory three-year application waiting period for buyers with a history of foreclosure, short sale or deed-in-lieu; and two-year application waiting period after a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. For buyers who can show that the economic event was preceded by at least a 20% household income reduction which lasted for six months or more; and who can show a satisfactory credit history for the most recent 12 months, the FHA will allow an application, and will agree to insure the home loan. The Back To Work program ended September 30, 2016.

Section 251 insures home purchase or refinancing loans with interest rates that may increase or decrease over time, which enables consumers to purchase or refinance their home at a lower initial interest rate.

FHA&#x27;s mortgage insurance programs help low- and moderate-income families become homeowners by lowering some of the costs of their mortgage loans. FHA mortgage insurance also encourages lenders to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers and projects that might not be able to meet conventional underwriting requirements, protecting the lender against loan default on mortgages for properties that meet certain minimum requirements, including manufactured homes, single and multifamily properties, and some health-related facilities. The basic FHA mortgage insurance program is Mortgage Insurance for One-to-Four-Family Homes (Section 203(b)).

FHA allows first time homebuyers to put down as little as 3.5% and receive up to 6% towards closing costs. However, some lenders won&#x27;t allow a seller to contribute more than 3% toward allowable closing costs. If little or no credit exists for the applicants, the FHA will allow a qualified non-occupant co-borrower to co-sign for the loan without requiring that person to reside in the home with the first time homebuyer. The co-signer does not have to be a blood relative. This is called a Non-Occupying Co-Borrower.

FHA also allows gifts to be used for down payment from the following sources:

* the borrower&#x27;s relative 
* the borrower&#x27;s employer or labor union 
* a close friend with a clearly defined and documented interest in the borrower
* a charitable organization 
* a governmental agency or public entity that has a program providing home ownership assistance

==The Hybrid adjustable rate==
FHA administers a number of programs, based on Section 203(b), that have special features. One of these programs, Section 251, insures adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) which, particularly during periods when interest rates are low, enable borrowers to obtain mortgage financing that is more affordable by virtue of its lower initial interest rate. This interest rate is adjusted annually, based on market indices approved by FHA, and thus may increase or decrease over the term of the loan. In 2006 FHA received approval to allow hybrid ARMs, in which the interest is fixed for the first 3 or 5 years, and is then adjusted annually according to market conditions and indices.

The FHA Hybrid provides for an initial fixed interest rate for a period of three or five years, and then adjusts annually after the initial fixed period. The 3/1 and 5/1 FHA Hybrid products allow up to a 1% annual interest rate adjustment after the initial fixed interest rate period, and a 5% interest rate cap over the life of the loan. The new payment after an adjustment will be calculated on the current principal balance at the time of the adjustment. This insures that the payment adjustment will be minimal even on a worst case rate change.

==Down payment grants==
Down payment assistance and community redevelopment programs offer affordable housing opportunities to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income individuals, and families who wish to achieve homeownership. Grant types include seller funded programs, the Grant America Program and others, as well as programs that are funded by the federal government, such as the American Dream Down Payment Initiative. Many down payment grant programs are run by state and local governments, often using mortgage revenue bond funds.

On May 27, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Ruling 2006–27, in which it ruled that certain non-profit seller-funded down payment assistance programs (DPA programs) were not operating as &quot;charitable organizations&quot;. The ruling was based largely on the circular nature of the cash flows, in which the seller paid the charity a &quot;fee&quot; after closing. Many believe that the &quot;grant&quot; is really being rolled into the price of the home. According to the Government Accountability Office, there are higher default and foreclosure rates for these mortgages.

On October 31, 2007, the Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted new regulations to ban so-called &quot;seller-funded&quot; down payment programs. The new regulations state that all organizations providing down payment assistance reimbursed by the property seller &quot;before, during, or after&quot; that sale must cease providing grants on FHA loans by October 30, 2007, with the exception of the Nehemiah Corporation. Nehemiah is the beneficiary of a lawsuit settlement with Department of Housing and Urban Development in April 1998. The terms of that settlement will allow Nehemiah to operate until April 1, 2008. Ameridream was granted an extension to the new regulations until February 29, 2008.

Several similarly operated government grant programs were introduced in response to the IRS Revenue Ruling in May 2006. Their governmental status made them exempt from the IRS Ruling, but they are still affected by the HUD Rule Change. One such organization was The Grant America Program, which was conducted by the Penobscot Indian Nation and had been available to all homebuyers in all fifty states.

==Mortgage insurance==

All FHA loans require mortgage insurance premium (MIP) irrespective of the size of the mortgage, down payment, and credit score. The FHA employs a two-tiered mortgage insurance premium (MIP) schedule. To obtain mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration, an upfront &quot;mortgage insurance premium&quot; (UFMIP) equal to 1.75% of the base loan amount at closing is required, and is normally financed into the total loan amount by the lender and paid to FHA on the borrower&#x27;s behalf. There is also a monthly mortgage insurance premium (MIP) which varies based on the amortization term and loan-to-value ratio.

FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) can be removed in two cases: first, if the initial loan-to-value ratio was less than or equal to 90%, second, if the FHA loan is refinanced. In the first case, FHA MIP is automatically removed after 11 years on mortgages where the borrower made an initial down payment of equal to or greater than 10% of the home value. In the second case, FHA MIP can be removed if the borrower pays off or refinances the FHA loan into a conventional loan. FHA MIP rates were lowered January 27, 2017 FHA MIP is not cancellable for mortgages originated after June 3, 2013. Starting March 20, 2023, FHA insured loans have lowered their MIP rates by 30 bps across all scenarios, the most notable loans going from 85 bps down to 55 bps., ensuring affordability for Americans.

<text>Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, sold motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines which it manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also used the brand name &quot;Enfield&quot; without the &quot;Royal&quot;. Later in 1994, Eicher Motors an Indian multinational automobile manufacturing company took over the company&#x27;s full ownership.

The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. The Enfield Cycle Company&#x27;s Royal Enfield Bullet is the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.

Royal Enfield&#x27;s spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their closure in early 1971. Enfield&#x27;s remaining motorcycle business became part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in 1978.

==History==
George Townsend set up a business in 1851 in Redditch making sewing needles. In 1882 his son, also named George, started making components for cycle manufacturers including saddles and forks. By 1886 complete bicycles were being sold under the names Townsend and Ecossais. This business suffered a financial collapse in 1891. Albert Eadie, sales manager of Birmingham&#x27;s Perry &amp; Co Ltd, pen makers who had begun to supply components for cycles, and Robert Walker Smith, an engineer from D. Rudge &amp; Co, were chosen by Townsend&#x27;s bankers to run the business. Then, in 1892, the firm was re-incorporated and named Eadie Manufacturing Company Limited; it was based in Snow Hill, Birmingham. Later, in 1907, after serious losses from their newly floated Enfield Autocar business, Eadie Manufacturing and its pedal-cycle component business was absorbed by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA). Years later, the BSA chairman was to tell shareholders that the acquisition had &quot;done wonders for the cycle department&quot;. Eadie still retained a separate identity when Raleigh bought BSA&#x27;s cycle interests in 1957.

==Enfield==

Eadie had won contracts to supply precision parts for firearms to the government&#x27;s long-established Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield, Middlesex, with its offshoot in Sparkbrook and had assumed the brand name Royal Enfield. In 1896 they also incorporated a new subsidiary company, The New Enfield Cycle Company Limited, to handle much of the cycle work and in 1897 Enfield making complete cycles as well parts for other assemblers took all the cycle assembly work from Eadie.

Enfield diversified into motor cycles, 1901 and motor cars, 1902. The motor department was put into a separate subsidiary, Enfield Autocar Company Limited incorporated in 1906 and established in new works at Hunt End, Redditch. However Enfield Autocar after just 19 months reported a substantial loss and, aside from Eadie himself, shareholders were unwilling to provide more capital so in early 1907 Eadie sold his control of Eadie Manufacturing to BSA. Albert Eadie and Robert Walker Smith had been appointed directors of BSA before the proposed sale had been put to shareholders. The new combined BSA and Eadie business manufactured &quot;military and sporting rifles, (pedal) cycle and cycle components, motor-cars etc.&quot; &quot;BSA and Eadie cycle specialities&quot;. But there were still minority Eadie shareholders alongside BSA in 1957.

The business of Enfield Autocar, that is to say the plant and stock, was sold to Birmingham&#x27;s Alldays &amp; Onions Pneumatic Engineering. Enfield Cycle Company took over the Hunt End premises.

In 1955, Enfield Cycle Company partnered with Madras Motors in India in forming Enfield of India, based in Chennai, and started assembling the 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras. The first machines were assembled from components imported from England. Starting in 1957, Enfield of India acquired the machines necessary to build components in India, and by 1962 all components were made in India.

Frank Walker Smith (1888–1962), eldest son of Robert Walker Smith, joined Enfield Cycle Company in 1909. Appointed joint (with his father) managing director in 1914 he took over the full responsibility when his father died in 1933. After his death Enfield was bought by investors E &amp; H P Smith who sold Enfield for £82,500 to Norton Villiers in 1967. While Norton Villiers acquired 33 per cent of Enfield India the assets of Enfield&#x27;s diesel engine division and pedal cycle and spares divisions were not picked up.

Royal Enfield produced bicycles at its Redditch factory until it closed in early 1967. The company&#x27;s last new bicycle was the &#x27;Revelation&#x27; small wheeler, released in 1965. Production of motorcycles ceased in 1970 and the original Redditch, Worcestershire-based company was dissolved in 1971.

Royal Enfield&#x27;s spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement to such an extent that the company as a whole survived for another three years until their closure in early 1971. C C Cooper, a West Bromwich metals dealer, continued to produce limited spare parts for a short time by a small team of engineers.

Enfield of India continued producing the &#x27;Bullet&#x27;, and began branding its motorcycles &#x27;Royal Enfield&#x27; in 1999. A lawsuit over the use of &#x27;Royal&#x27;, brought by trademark owner David Holder, was judged in favour of Enfield of India, who now produce motorcycles under the Royal Enfield name. The models produced and marketed in India include Cafe Racers, Cruisers, Retros and Adventure Tourers.

==Products==

By 1899, Royal Enfield were producing a &quot;quadricycle&quot; – a bicycle modified by adding a wrap-around four-wheeled frame, retaining a rear rider-saddle with handlebars – having a front-mounted passenger seat, driven by a rear-mounted De Dion engine.

After experimenting with a heavy bicycle frame fitted with a Minerva engine clamped to the front downtube, Enfield built their first motorcycle in 1901 with a 239 cc engine.

A light car was introduced in 1903 powered by either a French Ader V-twin or De Dion single cylinder engine. In 1906 car production was transferred to a new company, the Enfield Autocar Co Ltd with premises in Hunt End, Redditch. The independent company only lasted until 1908 when it was purchased by Alldays &amp; Onions.

In 1907, Enfield merged with the &quot;Alldays &amp; Onions Pneumatic Engineering Co.&quot; of Birmingham, and began manufacturing the Enfield-Allday automobile.
By 1910, Royal Enfield was using direct belt drive 297 cc Swiss Motosacoche V-Twin engines which were enlarged to 344cc for 1911 with the advent of chain drive and the Enfield 2-speed gear. Enfield hired Bert Colver from Matchless and competed in the 1911 Isle of Man lightweight TT. 

In 1912, the Royal Enfield Model 180 sidecar combination was introduced with a 770 cc V-twin JAP engine which was raced successfully in the Isle of Man TT and at Brooklands. Enfield developed a prototype for the soon-to-arrive 1913 425cc model 140. The prototype was Enfield&#x27;s first in-house manufactured V-twin, also at 344cc, being of overhead-inlet, side-exhaust layout.

===First World War (1914–1918)===
In 1914 Enfield supplied large numbers of motorcycles to the British War Department and also won a motorcycle contract for the Imperial Russian Government. Enfield used its own 225 cc two-stroke single and 425 cc V-twin engines. They also produced an 8 hp motorcycle sidecar model fitted with a Vickers machine gun.

===Inter-war years (1921–1939)===
In 1921, Enfield developed a new 976 cc twin, and in 1924 launched the first Enfield four-stroke 350 cc single using a Prestwich Industries engine.
In 1928, Royal Enfield began using the bulbous &#x27;saddle&#x27; tanks and centre-spring girder front forks, one of the first companies to do so. Even though it was trading at a loss in the depression years of the 1930s, the company was able to rely on reserves to keep going.
In 1931, Albert Eadie, one of the founders of the company, died and his partner R.W. Smith died soon afterwards in 1933.

===Very First Bullet (1932)===

1932 The Virtual Launch of the Very First Bullet Royal Enfield. When the very first Bullet was presented to the world, it was in a magazine! Due to the Great Depression, and the consequent cancellation of the vaunted Olympia Motorcycle Show, the ‘Motor Cycle’, the most popular motorcycling magazine of the time, decided to publish a special edition where the 250, 350 and 500cc Bullets were showcased to the world for the first time

===Second World War (1939–1945)===

During World War II, The Enfield Cycle Company was called upon by the British authorities to develop and manufacture military motorcycles. The models produced for the military were the WD/C 350 cc sidevalve, WD/CO 350 cc OHV, WD/D 250 cc SV, WD/G 350 cc OHV and WD/L 570 cc SV. One of the most well-known Enfields was the 125cc 2-stroke Royal Enfield WD/RE, designed to be dropped by parachute with airborne troops.

In order to establish a facility not vulnerable to the wartime bombing of the Midlands, an underground factory was set up, starting in 1942, in a disused Bath stone quarry at Westwood, near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. Many staff were transferred from Redditch and an estate of &quot;prefabs&quot; was built in Westwood to house them.

As well as motorcycle manufacture, it built other equipment for the war effort such as mechanical &quot;predictors&quot; for anti-aircraft gunnery: the manufacture of such high-precision equipment was helped by the constant temperature underground. After the war the factory continued, concentrating on engine manufacture and high-precision machining. After production of Royal Enfield motorcycles ceased, the precision engineering activities continued until the final demise of the company.

==Postwar Model G and Model J and ex-military C and CO (1946–1954)==
Postwar, Royal Enfield resumed production of the single cylinder ohv 350cc model G and 500cc Model J, with rigid rear frame and telescopic front forks. These were ride-to-work basic models, in a world hungry for transport. A large number of factory reconditioned ex-military sv Model C and ohv Model CO singles were also offered for sale, as they were sold off as surplus by various military services.

In 1948, a groundbreaking development in the form of rear suspension springing was developed, initially for competition-model &quot;trials&quot; models (modern enduro type machines), but this was soon offered on the roadgoing Model Bullet 350cc, a single cylinder OHV. This was a very popular seller, offering a comfortable ride. A 500cc version appeared shortly after. A mid-1950s version of the Bullet manufacturing rights and jigs, dies and tools was sold to India for manufacture there, and developed versions continue there to this day.

==500 Twins, Meteors, Super Meteors and Constellations 1949–1963==
In 1949, Royal Enfield&#x27;s version of the now popular-selling parallel twins appeared. This 500cc version was the forerunner of a range of Royal Enfield Meteors, 700cc Super Meteors and 700cc Constellations. Offering good performance at modest cost, these sold widely, if somewhat quietly in reputation. The 700cc Royal Enfield Constellation Twin has been described as the first superbike.

==250 cc models==
The 250cc class was important in the UK as it was the largest engine which a &#x27;learner&#x27; could ride without passing a test. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Royal Enfield produced a number of 250 cc machines, including a racer, the &#x27;GP&#x27; and a Scrambler, the &#x27;Moto-X&#x27;, which used a modified Crusader frame, leading link forks and a Villiers Starmaker engine. The Clipper was a base-model tourer with the biggest-seller being the Crusader, a 248 cc pushrod OHV single producing .
In 1965, a variant called the Continental GT, with red GRP tank, five-speed gearbox (which was also an option on the Crusader), clip-on handlebars, rearset footrests, swept pipe and hump-backed seat was launched. It sold well with its race-styling including a fly-screen resembling a race number plate which doubled as a front number plate mount. The Avon &#x27;Speedflow&#x27; full sports fairing was available as an extra in complementary factory colours of red and white.

Other variants were the Olympic and 250 Super 5, notable for use of leading-link front suspension (all the other 250 road models had conventional telescopic forks) and the 250 &#x27;Turbo Twin&#x27;, fitted with the Villiers 247 cc twin cylinder two-stroke engine.

The Royal Enfield GP production-volume racer was first raced in the Manx Grand Prix in September, 1964. Developed in conjunction with Royal Enfield Racing Manager Geoff Duke the first public appearance was at Earls Court Show in November, 1964. Using a duplex-tube frame, leading link forks and one-piece tank and seat unit, the 250cc two-stroke single engine was similar to other small capacity race machines offered from rivals Greeves, Cotton, DMW and particularly Villiers, which provided the engines for these marques and many other manufacturers and bike-builders including the &#x27;Starmaker&#x27; competition engine used for the Scorpion racer and Sprite scrambler.

==Royal Enfield Interceptor==

During the onslaught of the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers in the late sixties and early seventies, the English factories made a final attempt with the 692cc Interceptor in 1960–1961, followed in 1962–1968 by the 736cc Series I and Series II Interceptors. Made largely for the US market, it sported much chrome and strong performance, completing the quarter-mile in less than 13 seconds at speeds well above 175 km/h (105 mph). It became popular in the US, but the company was unable to supply this demand, which accelerated the demise of this last English-made Royal Enfield.

The Redditch factory ceased production in 1967 and the Bradford-on-Avon factory closed in 1970, which meant the end of the British Royal Enfield. After the factory closed a little over two hundred Series II Interceptor engines were stranded at the dock in 1970. These engines had been on their way to Floyd Clymer in the US; but Clymer had just died and his export agents, Mitchell&#x27;s of Birmingham, were left to dispose of the engines. They approached the Rickman brothers for a frame. The main problem of the Rickman brothers had always been engine supplies, so a limited run of Rickman Interceptors were promptly built.

==Enfield Indians==

From 1955 to 1959, Royal Enfields were painted red, and marketed in the US as Indian Motorcycles by the Brockhouse Corporation, who had control of the Indian Sales Corporation (and therefore Indian Motorcycles) and had stopped manufacturing all American Indians in the Springfield factory in 1953. But Americans were not impressed by the badge engineering, and the marketing agreement ended in 1960, and from 1961, Royal Enfields were available in the US under their own name. The largest Enfield &#x27;Indian&#x27; was a 700 cc twin named the Chief, like its American predecessors.

<doc id="974878" wikidata="Q250146" url="?curid=974878" title="Lizard (album)">
<text>Lizard is the third studio album by British progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 11 December 1970 by Island Records in the UK, and in January 1971 by Atlantic Records in the United States and Canada. It was the second consecutive King Crimson album recorded by transitional line-ups of the group that did not perform live, following &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;. This is the last of two albums by the band to feature Gordon Haskell (and the only one where he was both the lead singer and the bass guitarist as he only sang one song on the previous album) and the band&#x27;s only album to feature drummer Andy McCulloch.

==Background and production==

Haskell was previously a classmate of Robert Fripp at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s grammar school in Wimborne near Bournemouth, the pair having subsequently played together in the local band The League of Gentlemen. Haskell later contributed vocals to the King Crimson track &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot; on &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;, after Greg Lake left the band to join Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Fripp asked Haskell to become an official member of King Crimson for the recording of &quot;Lizard&quot;. Another &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; musician, saxophonist/flautist Mel Collins, was also asked to continue with the band. New member Andy McCulloch replaced Michael Giles on drums. The group was then augmented with session musicians, including another &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; alumnus, the noted jazz pianist Keith Tippett, together with Yes vocalist Jon Anderson, and brass/woodwind players Robin Miller, Mark Charig, and Nick Evans.

Haskell and McCulloch had an unhappy experience recording &quot;Lizard&quot;, finding it difficult to connect with the material, especially Haskell as a devotee of soul and Motown music. During rehearsals for a prospective tour following the album&#x27;s completion, Haskell left King Crimson. He sought legal redress for the next 19 years because he believed he had been cheated out of royalties owed him for the album. Shortly after Haskell left the group, McCulloch did likewise. The press release drafted by Sinfield to promote &quot;Lizard&quot; wryly quoted Max Ehrmann&#x27;s poem &quot;Desiderata&quot;, which contains advice on how to chart a true course through confusion.

Collins, on the other hand, remained in King Crimson with Fripp and Sinfield for the recording of the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Islands&quot;. Haskell was replaced with Boz Burrell on bass guitar and vocals, while McCulloch was replaced with his sometime housemate Ian Wallace. The &quot;Islands&quot; line-up of the group would finally give some of the &quot;Lizard&quot; material a live airing, with &quot;Cirkus&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Dancing Water&quot; becoming part of King Crimson&#x27;s touring repertoire. &quot;Cirkus&quot; would also later become part of the touring repertoire of the 21st Century Schizoid Band, whose members included Mel Collins and Jakko Jakszyk.

In 2016, for the band&#x27;s biggest European tour since 1974, &quot;Cirkus&quot; was included in the repertoire, as well as &quot;Dawn Song&quot;, which is part of the &quot;Lizard&quot; suite and was played live for the first time ever. For the 2017 North American tour, &quot;Dawn Song&quot; was expanded to the entire &quot;Battle of Glass Tears&quot; section (adding &quot;Last Skirmish&quot; and &quot;Prince Rupert&#x27;s Lament&quot;, neither of which had ever been performed live). The &quot;Bolero&quot; section was added to the live repertoire for the band&#x27;s 2018 European tour.

==Album cover==

&quot;Lizard&quot;s outside cover art is by Gini Barris, who was commissioned to produce it by Peter Sinfield. The inside cover consists of the song lyrics and credits printed over a marbled pattern, credited to Koraz Wallpapers, a company run by Barris&#x27; boyfriend at the time.

The album&#x27;s outside cover consists of the words &#x27;King Crimson&#x27; spelled out in ornate medieval illuminated or historiated lettering, the word &#x27;King&#x27; on the back cover and the word &#x27;Crimson&#x27; on the front cover, with each letter incorporating one or two discrete images. These images in turn represent Sinfield&#x27;s lyrics from the album – the images in the word &#x27;King&#x27; representing the lyrics of the various sections and subsections of track 5, &quot;Lizard&quot;; while the images in the word &#x27;Crimson&#x27; represent the lyrics of tracks 1–4. Whereas the images representing &quot;Lizard&quot; are medieval in content – depicting Prince Rupert, his environs (including a peacock), and the Battle of Glass Tears – the images representing the other four tracks juxtapose medieval and contemporary scenes. The image around the letter &#x27;i&#x27; in &#x27;Crimson&#x27;, for example, depicts the Beatles, corresponding with their pseudonymous appearance in the lyrics to &quot;Happy Family&quot;. Around the &quot;n&quot; on the front cover, there is a depiction of children&#x27;s comic character Rupert the Bear piloting a yellow aeroplane. Another notable feature below the letter &quot;n&quot; depicts a trio of Peter Gabriel (then the lead singer for Genesis), Ginger Baker (ex-drummer from the power trio Cream), and Jimi Hendrix.

In his book &quot;Prog Rock FAQ&quot;, Will Romano called Barris&#x27; work &quot;one of the era&#x27;s most beautifully strange pieces of album cover artwork&quot;. In an interview with Romano, Barris said that &quot;Lizard&quot; was &quot;one of my first jobs&quot; since studying graphics at the Central School of Art and Design in London. She contacted Sinfield after hearing he needed an artist to produce a cover for &quot;Lizard&quot;. When she suggested creating medieval miniatures, a passion of hers, Sinfield &quot;went for it&quot; and commissioned her to do the job. Barris recalled that she did not hear the music until after the album&#x27;s release, but worked from the lyrics Sinfield had given her. She cited the Lindisfarne Gospel and Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry illuminated manuscripts as inspiration for her work.

==Release==

Released on 11 December 1970 by Island Records (catalog no. ILPS 9141), &quot;Lizard&quot; reached number 29 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was released in the United States and Canada by Atlantic Records in January 1971 (catalog no. SD 8278), where it would reach number 113 in &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;Lizard&quot; was released by Atlantic at the same time as two other albums on the label featuring ex-King Crimson members: Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s debut album (featuring Greg Lake), and the lone release by Ian McDonald and Michael Giles.

The album had CD releases in 1989 and 2001, each newly remastered by Fripp at the time. The newest version was released in October 2009, containing a 5.1 Surround Sound mix on DVD-Audio, created by British musician and producer Steven Wilson in collaboration with Fripp, as well as a new stereo mix based on the surround one.

==Reception==
Since the album&#x27;s sound is more jazz-inflected than much of the band&#x27;s other work and many of its tracks idiosyncratic and experimental in nature, responses towards the album have been varied since its release. Music critic Robert Christgau rated the album a B−, saying that the &quot;jazziness&quot; of the album projected a &quot;certain cerebral majesty&quot; but criticized Peter Sinfield&#x27;s lyrics, qualifying them as &quot;overwrought&quot;.

In his retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Dave Lynch described it as, &quot;Seamlessly blending rock, jazz, and classical in a way that few albums have successfully achieved, &quot;Lizard&quot; is epic, intimate, cacophonic, and subtle by turn – and infused with the dark moods first heard when &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; and &quot;Epitaph&quot; reached listeners&#x27; ears the previous year.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reviewer described &quot;Lizard&quot; as &quot;a decidedly Miles Davis-influenced hodgepodge of classical and jazz influences brought to their logical, near-chaotic end&quot; and defined its music &quot;mind-bending, unclassifiable creative stuff.&quot;

Robert Fripp has been very critical of the album since it&#x27;s release, calling it &quot;unlistenable&quot; and lovers of it as &quot;very strange&quot;. However, he revised his opinion upon listening to Steven Wilson&#x27;s surround-sound mix of the album for the 40th anniversary reissue, proclaiming, &quot;For the first time I have heard the Music in the music.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;PopMatters&quot; listed the title track at #13 in their list &quot;The 25 Best Progressive Rock Songs of All Time.&quot;

<text>Kirstenbosch is a botanical garden nestled at the eastern foot of Table Mountain in Cape Town. The garden is one of 10 National Botanical Gardens covering five of South Africa&#x27;s six different biomes and administered by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). Prior to 1 September 2004, the institute was known as the National Botanical Institute.

Kirstenbosch places a strong emphasis on the cultivation of indigenous plants. When Kirstenbosch was founded in 1913 to preserve the flora native to the South Africa’s territory, it was the first botanical garden in the world with this ethos, at a time when invasive species were not considered an ecological and environmental problem.

The garden includes a large conservatory (The Botanical Society Conservatory) exhibiting plants from a number of different regions, including savanna, fynbos, karoo and others. Outdoors, the focus is on plants native to the Cape region, highlighted by the spectacular collections of proteas. It is a level IV accredited Arboreta by the ArbNet Arboretum Accreditation Program and The Morton Arboretum.

== History ==
In 1660, by order of Jan van Riebeeck, a hedge of wild almond and brambles were planted to afford some protection to the perimeter of the Dutch colony. Sections of this hedge, named Van Riebeeck&#x27;s Hedge, still exist in Kirstenbosch. The hedge is a Provincial Heritage Site. The area of the botanical garden was used for the harvesting of timber during this period.

The &quot;Kirsten&quot; part of the name is believed to be the surname of the manager of the land, J.F. Kirsten, in the 18th century. The &quot;bosch&quot; part of the name is a Dutch word for forest or bush.

The handover of ownership of the colony to Britain in 1811 brought changes in the use of the Kirstenbosch area. Two large land grants were made, with a Colonel Bird building a house, planting chestnut trees, and establishing a bath (still extant) fed by a natural spring. The Ecksteen family acquired the land in 1823, and it later came into the possession of the Cloete family (a well-known Cape lineage). Under their stewardship, the area was farmed more formally, being planted with oaks, fruit trees, and vineyards.

The land was thereafter purchased by Cecil Rhodes in 1895. After this point, the area became run-down, with large groups of pigs feeding on the acorns and wallowing in the pools. The famous Camphor Avenue was planted in 1898. The land now occupied by the Kirstenbosch Gardens was bequeathed to the nation by Rhodes, who died in 1902.

The history of the area as a botanical garden has its origin in Henry Harold Pearson, a botanist from Cambridge University who came to the Cape Colony in 1903 to take up a position as professor in the newly created chair of botany at the South African College (the predecessor of today&#x27;s University of Cape Town.) In February 1911, Pearson visited the area of Kirstenbosch by cart with Neville Stuart Pillans to assess its suitability as a site for a botanical garden. On 1 July 1913, the area was set aside for this purpose by the government of the colony, with an annual budget of £1,000. No money was set aside for a salaried director&#x27;s position, but Pearson accepted the position without pay. He lived in the gardens in difficult and reduced circumstances.

The task confronting Pearson was formidable. The area was overgrown, populated by wild pigs, overrun with weeds, and planted with orchards. Money was tight, and the budget was supplemented by the sale of firewood and acorns. Pearson commenced work in the area of Kirstenbosch known as &quot;The Dell&quot;, planting cycads which are still visible there today.

Pearson died in 1916 from pneumonia. He was buried in his beloved garden, and his epitaph is still there today: &quot;If ye seek his monument, look around&quot;. Since 1913, the garden has been successively administered by the Botanical Society of South Africa, the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa, the National Botanical Institute, and the South African Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) from 2004. The garden celebrated its centenary in 2013, issuing the commemorative book &quot;Kirstenbosch: The Most Beautiful Garden in Africa&quot;.

== Research ==

Kirstenbosch scientists, such as Winsome Barker, Graham Duncan, and John Manning, have published many scientific papers, books, and monographs on South African flora, including the &quot;Kirstenbosch Gardening Series&quot;. The gardens have also published a series of monographs, known sequentially as &quot;Memoirs of the Botanical Survey of South Africa&quot;, &quot;Annals of the Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens&quot;, and &quot;Strelitzia&quot;.

=== Compton Herbarium ===
The Compton Herbarium, which conducts research activities including identifying and describing new species, is located at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden.

==== Purpose ====
The herbarium is mainly geared toward studying the plant species of the winter rainfall region. Roughly 250,000 dried specimens are preserved here. Local and foreign botanists research proteas, heaths, amaryllis, and orchids. Conservationists, foresters, entomologists, and manufacturers of pesticides and fertilizers also participate in research here. A large library with relevant books is available for researchers.

==== History ====
The Compton Herbarium was founded after the Bolus Herbarium moved from Kirstenbosch to the campus of the University of Cape Town. Prof. Robert Harold Compton, the second director of Kirstenbosch, kept a small herbarium in his office since 1937. In 1940, this was moved to where the Bolus Herbarium had once stood. Later, the Iziko South African Museum Herbarium and the Stellenbosch Government Herbarium were transferred here, as well. Since 1996, the collections have been based in a new, modern research complex.

==== South African Museum Herbarium ====
This collection contains many valuable plants from all over the world; the oldest herbarium in the country, it is also one of the oldest in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1825, Danish botanist Christian Friedrich Ecklon brought 325 species to the museum. Dr. Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe came into possession of the collection in 1855, and was appointed the first colonial botanist in the Cape in 1858. Pappe also built his own private herbarium and bought that of Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher. After Pappe&#x27;s death, the Cape Colony government purchased the Pappe and Zeyher collections. Since 1956, the three herbaria have been housed at Kirstenbosch with the Compton Herbarium, but they remain a separate union. Only in 1988 did they become the property of the SANBI.

==== Stellenbosch Government Herbarium ====
This herbarium was established by Dr. Augusta Vera Duthie in 1902. In 1960, it was donated to the state by the Stellenbosch University, and since then has been known under this name. In 1996, it was moved to Kirstenbosch and incorporated into the Compton Herbarium.

== Chelsea Flower Show ==
In 2008, the Kirstenbosch exhibit at the Chelsea Flower Show won a gold medal for the most creative display and the &quot;President&#x27;s Cup&quot; (a new award by the Royal Horticultural Society president Peter Buckley to his favourite stand). The 2008 exhibit was the 16th designed by David Davidson and Raymond Hudson, which established South Africa &quot;as a front runner in horticulture&quot;. The exhibit was entitled &quot;The Heat is On&quot; and featured an &quot;Aloidendron dichotomum&quot; (also known as a quiver tree), which is being studied and monitored as an indicator of climate change. Dead and dying quiver trees were displayed alongside live specimens to illustrate how warmer temperatures have forced the species to migrate southwards. Kirstenbosch has won 29 gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show in 33 appearances.

==Recreational use==
Kirstenbosch enjoys great popularity with residents and visitors. From the gardens, several trails lead off along and up the mountain slopes, and these are much used by walkers and mountaineers. One of the trails, up a ravine called Skeleton Gorge, is an easy and popular route to the summit of Table Mountain. This route is also known as Smuts&#x27; Track after Prime Minister Jan Smuts, who used this route regularly. On the slopes above the cultivated parts of the garden, a contour path leads through forests to Constantia Nek to the south. The same contour path can be followed to the north for quite a distance, and it takes the hiker past the Rhodes Memorial to the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak and beyond.

Kirstenbosch regularly exhibits Zimbabwean stone sculptures in the gardens. Many of the artists are associated with Chapungu Sculpture Park in Zimbabwe.

In summer, a popular series of outdoor concerts is held in the gardens on Sunday evenings. Many well-known local artists such as the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, Johnny Clegg, The Parlotones, Ike Moriz, Arno Carstens, Goldfish, and Mango Groove have performed here. In recent years, several international performers such as Michael Bublé and Cliff Richard have also held concerts on the Kirstenbosch stage.

== Recognition ==
In 2015, the International Garden Tourism Awards Body declared Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens the International Garden of the Year.

== South African National Biodiversity Institute ==
In 1951, the Botanical Research Institute (BRI) was created from the Division of Botany, Pretoria, and in turn, became the National Botanical Institute (NBI) in 1989. In 2004, the National Botanical Institute was absorbed into a broader configuration, the SANBI, by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA). Since 1921, NBI has published a scientific botanical journal, &quot;Bothalia&quot;. In 2014, it was renamed &quot;Bothalia – African Biodiversity and Conservation&quot; to reflect the broader scope of SANBI.

<doc id="974897" wikidata="Q2034661" url="?curid=974897" title="Vanguard Records">
<text>Vanguard Recording Society is an American record label set up in 1950 by brothers Maynard and Seymour Solomon in New York City. It was a primarily classical label at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, but also has a catalogue of recordings by a number of pivotal jazz, folk, and blues musicians. The Bach Guild was a subsidiary label.

The label was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music in April 2015.

==History==
The newly founded venture&#x27;s first record was of J.S. Bach&#x27;s 21st cantata, &quot;Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis&quot;, BWV 21 (&quot;I had much grief&quot;), with Jonathan Sternberg conducting the tenor Hugues Cuénod and other soloists, chorus and orchestra. &quot;What speaks for the Solomons&#x27; steadfastness in their taste and their task&quot;, wrote a &quot;Billboard&quot; journalist in November 1966, &quot;is that this record is still alive in the catalogue (SC-501). As Seymour says, it was a good performance, not easy to top. Of the whole Vanguard/Bach Guild catalogue, numbering about 480 issues, 30 are Bach records...&quot; The label also recorded other baroque and earlier works, pieces from the English Madrigal School performed by the Deller Consort, Italian and French madrigal masterpieces, Elizabethan and Jacobean music, and Henry Purcell.

In 1953, under the direction of John Hammond, the company began the Jazz Showcase series that concentrated on mainstream jazz, producing about two dozen recordings before it was closed in 1958. Recordings made at the Spirituals to Swing concerts in 1938 and 1939 were released by Vanguard in 1959. The company only intermittently pursued recording jazz after that.

In the mid-1950s Vanguard signed blacklisted performers Paul Robeson and the Weavers. It continued to issue folk music with newly signed artists Joan Baez, Hedy West, the Rooftop Singers, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Ian and Sylvia, and Mimi and Richard Fariña. Around this time, Vanguard briefly ran a hi-fi record division titled Vanguard Stereolab; the English band Stereolab took their name from this.

In the summer of 1965, Maynard Solomon hired Samuel Charters to edit the tapes of the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. Following that project, the company sent Charters to Chicago to capture the broad range of blues musicians there. Those sessions resulted in the 1966 three-album series titled &quot;Chicago/The Blues/Today!&quot;. The albums included Junior Wells with Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters&#x27;s bandmates Otis Spann and James Cotton, Otis Rush, Homesick James, Johnny Shines, Big Walter Horton, and Charlie Musselwhite.

Vanguard released numerous classical recordings, both domestically produced and imported. Many of the latter came from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Pye Records label, featuring performances by the Halle Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. The recordings were so exceptional that many classical radio stations programmed them. Vanguard even released some quadraphonic classical recordings in the early 1970s, including a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fourth Symphony with the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The label also released many performances by the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maurice Abravanel, including one of the first sets of the complete ten symphonies of Gustav Mahler, a complete performance of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, as well as the earlier P.D.Q. Bach recordings, from 1965 to 1983. Vanguard was the first American label to release the complete 1944 high fidelity recordings of composer Richard Strauss conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in most of his tone poems; the recordings were made on the Magnetophon tape recording equipment in the Vienna Opera House.

The multiplicity of popular in-house classical music series released by the Solomons on Vanguard and Bach Guild between 1950 and 1966 include, in addition to 22 Bach cantatas, the virtuoso trumpet, virtuoso flute and virtuoso oboe, along with German University Songs with Erich Kunz, songs of the Auvergne, Viennese dances with Willi Boskovsky, traditional songs by Roland Hayes, Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons and other concertos from I Solisti di Zagreb, music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, numerous Haydn symphonies performed by the Esterhazy Orchestra, a double LP of Gluck&#x27;s opera Orfeo ed Euridice sung in Italian with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra led by Charles Mackerras, and an influential Mahler cycle with the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maurice Abravanel.

After entering the rock and roll market by signing Country Joe and the Fish, Vanguard started a 6500 series for releases by rock acts but had little success. By the early 1970s, with acts such as Joan Baez and Ian &amp; Sylvia leaving for other labels, and disappointing sales for the &quot;Everyman&quot; budget classical series, Vanguard&#x27;s stature in the music industry was diminished. The label stayed minimally active with specialty releases such as those by Indian classical musician and sarod virtuoso Vasant Rai. An unexpected novelty hit on Vanguard, &quot;Shaving Cream&quot; by Benny Bell, led the company to release albums of humorous music inspired by Dr. Demento. In the late 1970s Tom Paxton issued two albums, &quot;New Songs from the Briar-patch&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, on the label. A few disco albums by acts such as Players Association, Alphone Mouzon&#x27;s &quot;Poussez&quot;, and Marcus Barone&#x27;s &quot;The Ring/Savage Lover&quot; were released on Vanguard with both domestic and worldwide chart impact.

After this period of near-dormancy, Vanguard was sold to the Welk Music Group in 1985. The Welk Group sold the classical music catalog back to Seymour Solomon. Welk Music Group revitalized the label, reissuing much of its extensive folk and popular music back catalogue (a good deal of which had been out of print for several years) on CD, as well as signing a number of new artists (such as Matt Nathanson, Mindy Smith, Greg Laswell, and Trevor Hall), in addition to established musicians such as Merle Haggard, John Fogerty, Chris Isaak, Robert Cray, Shawn Mullins, and Linda Ronstadt. The label also formed marketing partnerships with a number of artist-run label imprints, to include Levon Helm (Dirt Farmer Music), Indigo Girls (IG Recording), and Chely Wright (Painted Red Music), among others. This era for Vanguard also garnered the label three consecutive Grammy Awards for Levon Helm, multiple Grammy Awards for Robert Cray, and an RIAA certified platinum single for Matt Nathanson&#x27;s &quot;Come on Get Higher.&quot; In 2008, Welk Music Group began a distribution deal with EMI to handle its labels, including Vanguard.

After Seymour Solomon&#x27;s death, Vanguard Classics was sold to Artemis Records, which reactivated the company with new releases by Leon Fleisher and Gil Shaham. When Artemis folded in 2004, the Vanguard Classics catalogue was sold to Sheridan Square Entertainment, which is licensing the Vanguard Classics material. Sheridan Square eventually became IndieBlu, which was acquired by Entertainment One in 2010. Vanguard Music Group was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music in April 2015., Concord&#x27;s Craft Recordings unit manages the Vanguard catalog.

Vanguard used the Brooklyn Masonic Temple in New York City as one of its recording studios for many of its sessions.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Philip Louis Vian, &amp; Two Bars (15 July 1894 – 27 May 1968) was a Royal Navy officer who served in both World Wars.

Vian specialised in naval gunnery from the end of the First World War and received several appointments as gunnery officer. In the early 1930s, he was given command of a destroyer, , and, later, various destroyer flotillas. During this phase of his career, in early 1940, he commanded a force that forcibly released captured British merchant sailors from the German supply ship in Jøssingfjord in then-neutral Norway and, later, his flotilla took an active role in the final action of the .

Much of Vian&#x27;s Second World War service was in the Mediterranean, where he commanded a cruiser squadron, defended several critical convoys and led naval support at the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy. His wartime service was completed in command of the air component of the British Pacific Fleet, with successful actions against the Japanese in Sumatra and the western Pacific. Post-war, Vian served in the United Kingdom, as a Fifth Sea Lord and as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. He retired in 1952 with the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, took up commercial directorships, and died at home in 1968.

==Early life==
Born the son of Alsager Richard Vian and Ada Frances Vian (née Renault), Vian joined the Royal Navy as an officer cadet in May 1907 and was educated at the Royal Naval Colleges at Osborne and Dartmouth. On passing out from Dartmouth in 1911, Vian and his term sailed for the West Indies on the training cruiser but the cruise was ended by grounding on an uncharted reef off Nova Scotia. He became a midshipman on the pre-dreadnought battleship , which was serving with the Home Fleet, on 15 January 1912.

==First World War==
At the start of the First World War, Vian remained on &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; which, as an obsolescent ship, was kept at Portland away from danger. This was disappointing for Vian, but when the ship was to be transferred to the Mediterranean he was posted to what he considered to be an even less desirable appointment. From October 1914 to September 1915, Vian served in , an old first-class protected cruiser patrolling in East African waters, on the lookout for the German cruiser . He was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant in January 1915. Dissatisfied by the lack of action in &quot;Argonaut&quot;, Vian used a promise of help from William Fisher and subsequently received an appointment to , a modern Yarrow-built M-class destroyer, in October 1915. Whilst on this ship, he was a spectator at the Battle of Jutland, in which his ship played no active part. Promotion to lieutenant in 1917 (with seniority backdated to February 1916) resulted in two appointments as First Lieutenant in the destroyers (September 1916) and (December 1917).

==Inter-war==
Following gunnery courses in 1916, 1918 and 1919 at the gunnery school (), Vian obtained a First Class certificate in Gunnery in October 1919. Despite being slated for service with the British Military Mission in Southern Russia, he was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy for two years from January 1920 and served as Gunnery Officer of , then the Australian flagship. On his return to the Royal Navy, Vian was given a series of appointments as gunnery officer, first, in January 1923, to the battleship , then serving as a cadet training ship. During this appointment, he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 February 1924. This was followed in 1924 by two appointments to s ( and ). There was a short period at the Devonport gunnery school () and another sea posting, to the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet in May 1925.

There followed two foreign postings, still as a gunnery specialist. First in February 1927 to , in the Mediterranean Fleet. This was followed, in November 1927, to , the then-flagship of the China Station, where he was promoted to commander on 30 June 1929. For the two years up to January 1933, Vian had a &quot;shore&quot; appointment at the Admiralty in London, with the Director for Staff Training and Development (DTSD), analysing practice gunnery statistics. He then attended a short Tactical Course in Portsmouth and subsequently took command (his first), in March 1933, of the destroyer and a Division within the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla (part of the Mediterranean Fleet).

A biography of the playwright Noël Coward refers to Coward meeting Vian at that time. Coward arrived at Bermuda on on 28 May 1933 and boarded the light cruiser on 30 May 1933. Vian&#x27;s first words to Coward were &quot;What the hell are you doing on board this ship?&quot; However, after speaking to Coward and having gin with him in the captain&#x27;s cabin, Vian permitted Coward to stay on the ship for a cruise on the ship ending on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal, Coward finally ending up in Trinidad some time later.

Two incidents occurred during this command for which Vian was held to be at fault: damage to &quot;Active&quot; while going astern alongside a depot ship in Malta and the loss of a torpedo from . However, Vian&#x27;s commander-in chief, William Fisher, had remained well-disposed towards him, and these incidents had no ill effect on his career: he was promoted to captain on 31 December 1934. On his return to the UK in early 1935, he was told to expect to spend time on half-pay, but the Abyssinian crisis intervened and he was given command of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla (on board ), which had been activated from the reserve to reinforce Malta.

Vian returned to the UK in July 1935 at the end of the crisis and attended a Senior Officers Technical Course before rejoining the 19th Destroyer Flotilla. In May 1936, he was transferred to command the 1st Destroyer Flotilla, flotilla leader , also at Malta. In July, 1st Destroyer Flotilla returned to Portsmouth. En route home, however, Vian&#x27;s ships responded to a call from the British Consul in Vigo for protection for British residents at the start of the Spanish Civil War. His ships acted in various roles, including, after discussion, the evacuation of British residents. When relieved by the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Vian&#x27;s ships continued home. During a period at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, Vian was unexpectedly offered an appointment as Flag-Captain to Rear-Admiral Lionel Wells in , flagship of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, then part of the Mediterranean Fleet. He greatly preferred sea duties and gladly took up the new appointment in March 1937.

==Second World War==
Vian returned to the UK shortly before the Second World War broke out. An appointment to command the boys&#x27; training establishment was cancelled, and he was appointed to command of the 11th Destroyer Flotilla. This flotilla had been recently activated from reserve and consisting of seven old s plus his own ship, , based first at Plymouth then at Liverpool, with the role of escorting Atlantic convoys. There was an ineffective brush with a U-boat. A change in policy required Vian, as a Captain (D), to operate from shore, the better to command his flotilla. Early in 1940 he moved, this time to command of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, the famous s. The leader&#x27;s ship at the time was but as she was due for a refit he swapped ships to take over .
===&quot;Altmark&quot;===

In February 1940, Vian&#x27;s flotilla was ordered to find and locate the German supply tanker, . This ship was believed to be holding around 300 British merchant seamen captured by . When found, &quot;Altmark&quot; was in neutral Norwegian waters, escorted by two Norwegian torpedo boats. After peacefully negating the Norwegian opposition, Vian pursued &quot;Altmark&quot; into Jøssingfjord, she was boarded and the captives were freed. The German and Norwegian governments protested that this was a violation of international law and of Norwegian neutrality. However, occurring during a quiet stage in the war, the incident was widely publicised in Britain. Vian was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for this successful action, the citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 9 April 1940 (dated 12 April 1940, and read:

===Naval actions===
The Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940 and Vian, now in &quot;Afridi&quot;, was engaged in a number of operations against German shipping and warships and in support of Allied troops. On 9 April 1940, Vian&#x27;s destroyers were escorting two cruisers ( and ) off Bergen when they came under heavy German air attack. became isolated and was sunk. From 15 to 17 April, &quot;Afridi&quot; assisted and protected British troop landings at Namsos (Operation Maurice), which were a part of a planned pincer movement to seize Trondheim. &quot;Afridi&quot; later assisted the evacuation of Namsos and the rescue of the survivors of the , during which, on 3 May, &quot;Afridi&quot; was bombed and sunk; the survivors were rescued by destroyers and . Vian was mentioned in despatches for his part in the action.

On the night of 13/14 October, Vian, now re-established in HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; and with HMS &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Maori&quot; and &quot;Sikh&quot;, attacked a small German convoy off Egerö light. Although the operation&#x27;s success was over-stated (just one ship was sunk and later refloated), Vian was awarded a bar to his DSO.

On 22 May 1941, Vian, in HMS &quot;Cossack&quot;, with several destroyers, provided additional escort to troop convoy WS8B en route from Glasgow to the Indian Ocean. On 25 May, Vian&#x27;s destroyers (HMS &quot;Cossack&quot;, &quot;Maori&quot;, &quot;Sikh&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot; and ) were detached from the convoy to join the search for the German battleship . Eventually, Vian&#x27;s flotilla participated in the destruction of &quot;Bismarck&quot;. While the main battle fleet awaited daylight, they, in a series of night attacks, harried the German ship. They failed to score a hit in the darkness, but their activities fixed the German&#x27;s position and denied the crew much-needed rest before the main battle on 27 May. Afterwards, they escorted back to Scotland. Vian received a second bar to his DSO for this action.
Vian was promoted to rear admiral on 8 July 1941, by special order of the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound. During July and August, 1941, Vian was involved in liaising with the Soviet Navy to assess their readiness and to investigate the practicalities of a British naval force being based at Murmansk or nearby. In the event, Vian advised against this, but in September, 1941, he commanded Force K, a naval force that supported an Anglo-Canadian raid and demolition on the Norwegian archipelago of Spitsbergen. The intention was to clear out any German garrison (there was none), destroy the coal mines and coal stocks and evacuate the Russian miners. The troops were aboard the liner , escorted by two Royal Navy cruisers, and and three destroyers: , and and several smaller ships. The operation was successful and during Force K&#x27;s return, a German convoy was intercepted and the German training cruiser was sunk.

===Mediterranean===
In October 1941, Vian was given command of the 15th Cruiser Squadron (flag in , stationed at Alexandria. The main naval tasks at this stage of the Mediterranean campaign were to ensure the survival of Malta as a British possession and military base by the protection of supply convoys while preventing Italian convoys supplying their forces in north Africa. Secondary tasks included the supply and artillery support of Allied military actions in north Africa and elsewhere, such as a successful bombardment of Derna in December. Vian&#x27;s first convoy was in December 1941 and led to the First Battle of Sirte. This was, in effect, a series of skirmishes between British and Italian warships escorting desperately needed supply convoys. Overall, the fight was inconclusive, but both sides managed to deliver the supplies. There were several sorties to support the army and to intercept Italian convoys. On one such operation, in early March 1942, Vian&#x27;s flagship, HMS &quot;Naiad&quot;, was torpedoed and sunk by . Vian transferred his flag to and later to .

Malta was still in a desperate state and another convoy (MG1) was run in March 1942. This time, the Italian Navy made a more determined attempt to intercept the convoy, leading to the Second Battle of Sirte. Vian&#x27;s force of cruisers and destroyers, using threat and concealment by smoke, managed to hold off the Italians while the convoy escaped. The naval action was portrayed as a tactical success against a greatly superior enemy, although the convoy&#x27;s progress was sufficiently delayed to leave it vulnerable to air attacks and all four transports were sunk and the bulk of the supplies were lost. Despite this, Vian received a personal letter of congratulation from Winston Churchill and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE).

In June 1942, Vian&#x27;s force provided escort for the Operation Vigorous convoy from Haifa and Port Said. This was a part of a sequence of movements but it was rebuffed by strong surface and air forces and returned. After this failed operation, Vian&#x27;s health deteriorated and he was sent back to Britain in September 1942. During a delay in the journey in west Africa, he caught malaria and was not passed fit for service until January, 1943. In January, he was mentioned in despatches for &quot;outstanding zeal, patience and cheerfulness and for setting an example of wholehearted devotion to duty without which the high tradition of the Royal Navy could not have been upheld&quot;.

Vian&#x27;s physical condition was now considered to debar him from further sea service and in April 1943 he was appointed to the planning staff for the invasion of Europe. Probably much to his relief, however, this shore job was pre-empted by his return to the Mediterranean to command (from ) an amphibious force for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.

In September 1943, he commanded Force V, a flotilla of escort aircraft carriers providing air support for the Allied landings at Salerno, Italy. Force V comprised the escort aircraft carriers , , and , and the maintenance carrier , acting temporarily as a light fleet carrier. The planned period had to be increased and, when Lieutenant General Mark Clark, commanding the American Fifth Army, requested Force V to stay longer despite fuel shortages, Vian replied: &quot;My carriers will stay here if we have to row back.&quot; Vian was twice mentioned in despatches; once for each of the Italian operations.

===Normandy landings===
In November 1943, Vian returned to the UK as commander of Force J in preparation for D-Day and in January 1944, he was appointed commander of the Eastern Task Force (in ), supporting the D-Day landings in Normandy. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, which coincided with the early stages of the invasion. After the success of the landings, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) &quot;for distinguished services in the planning and execution of the successful landings&quot;.

===British Pacific Fleet===

In November 1944, Vian became the commander in charge of air operations of the British Pacific Fleet (Flag Officer Commanding, 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron, British Pacific Fleet and Second in Command, British Pacific Fleet, in ). The first operations of Vian&#x27;s new command were against Japanese oil and port installations in Sumatra (Operations &quot;Cockpit&quot;, &quot;Transom&quot;, &quot;Lentil&quot; and &quot;Meridian&quot;). These served to damage the enemy&#x27;s capabilities, distract his attention from events elsewhere and provide experience for the British and Commonwealth crews in the procedures that they would use while working with the Americans in the western Pacific. The U.S. aircraft carrier, , participated in the training exercises and the first two operations. Vian was mentioned in despatches once again for &quot;bravery, skill and devotion to duty&quot;. Once in the Pacific, the BPF operated as Task Force 57 from March 1945, providing air support for the American invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). Their role was to interdict the Sakishima Islands, suppressing Japanese air operations. Vian&#x27;s carriers were externally resistant to the determined suicide attacks, returning to active service within hours. He was promoted to vice admiral on 8 May 1945.
==Post war==
After the Japanese surrender, Vian returned finally to the UK and became Fifth Sea Lord in charge of naval aviation from 1946 until 1948, when he was promoted to admiral. His final appointment was commander in chief, Home Fleet (in ) until his retirement in 1952. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1952 New Year Honours. On 1 June 1952 he was promoted to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet.

Vian was mentioned in despatches five times, and received several foreign awards.

In retirement, Vian became a director of the Midland Bank and the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company. He also published his memoirs, &quot;Action This Day&quot;, in 1960. He died on 27 May 1968 at his home at Ashford Hill, Hampshire near Newbury, Berkshire.

==Family==
Vian married, on 2 December 1929, Marjorie, daughter of Colonel David Price Haig, OBE of Withyham in Sussex; they had two daughters.

<text>Ascential plc (formerly EMAP) is a British-headquartered global company, specialising in events, intelligence and advisory services for the marketing and financial technology industries. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Informa in October 2024.

==History==
Richard Winfrey purchased the &quot;Spalding Guardian&quot; in 1887 and later purchased the &quot;Lynn News&quot; and the &quot;Peterborough Advertiser&quot;; he also started the &quot;North Cambs Echo&quot;. He became a Liberal politician and campaigner for agricultural rights and the papers were used to promote his political views in and around Spalding, Boston, Sleaford and Peterborough. During World War II Winfrey&#x27;s newspaper interests began to be passed over to his son, Richard Pattinson Winfrey (1902–1985). In 1947, under the direction of &#x27;Pat&#x27; Winfrey, the family&#x27;s newspaper titles were consolidated to form the East Midland Allied Press (EMAP): this was achieved by the merger of the Northamptonshire Printing and Publishing Company, the Peterborough Advertiser Company, the West Norfolk and King&#x27;s Lynn Newspaper Company and commercial printing sections at Rushden, King&#x27;s Lynn and Bury St Edmunds.

The magazine division was founded on a hunch when the company&#x27;s printing presses lay dormant between printing issues of the local papers. The staff gambled that a weekly angling publication would be a hit; in 1953, &quot;Angling Times&quot; was born. This was soon joined by another weekly heavyweight when EMAP bought &quot;Motor Cycle News&quot; from its founder in 1956 for £100. EMAP grew significantly in the late 1970s under the guidance of the extremely successful partnership of Sir Robin Miller and David Arculus. In 1992 and 1993, EMAP moved into trade magazines by acquiring titles from Maxwell Communication and Thomson. In 1996, EMAP agreed to sell its 65 newspaper titles, including the 300-year-old &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot;, to Johnston Press for £111 million.

Scottish Radio Holdings was acquired by EMAP on 21 June 2005. In 2006, EMAP sold its French division to Italy&#x27;s Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. On 27 July 2007, EMAP announced that it was undertaking a review of the structure of the group in response to receiving a number of unsolicited proposals to purchase parts of the company. On 12 September 2007, EMAP announced that it had completed the disposal of its Australian consumer magazine division, EMAP Australia for approximately £38m to ACP Magazines. On 29 January 2008, EMAP completed the sale of its radio, television and consumer media businesses (EMAP Radio) to German company Bauer for £1.14bn. The remainder of the company was taken over by Eden Bidco Ltd, a company incorporated for the purpose of the acquisition by its owners, the private equity investment group Apax and the Guardian Media Group in late March/early April 2008.

In March 2012, the company announced that it would be renamed Top Right Group, and that its magazines, events and data businesses would be separated into three standalone companies. The EMAP name would continue to be used for the magazines operation, which at the time accounted for around 18 per cent of the group&#x27;s turnover. The database business was renamed 4C Group, and the events unit was renamed I2i Events Group. Then in October 2015 the company announced that the EMAP brand would be scrapped as all its titles move to digital-only format.

In February 2015, Top Right Group sold Media Business Insight (including &quot;Broadcast&quot;, &quot;Shots&quot; and &quot;Screen International&quot;) to Mobeus Equity Partners and Tenzing PE.

In December 2015, Top Right Group rebranded as Ascential. The company was the subject of an £800m initial public offering in February 2016. The Guardian Media Group sold off its shares of Ascential in 2016 and 2017.

In June 2017, Ascential sold heritage brands (business-to-business titles) to Metropolis International. The transaction included the rights to EMAP name (as EMAP Publishing Ltd).

In July 2024, Informa reached a deal to acquire Ascential for approximately £1.2 billion. The court sanctioned the deal in October 2024, allowing the transaction to proceed to completion.

<text>Messier 96 (also known as M96 or NGC 3368) is an intermediate spiral galaxy about 31 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.

==Observational history and appearance==
It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1781. After communicating his finding, French astronomer Charles Messier confirmed the finding four days later and added it to his catalogue of nebulous objects. 

Finding this object is burdensome with large binoculars. Ideal minimum resolution, in a good sky, is via a telescope of aperture, to reveal its halo with a brighter core region.

This complex galaxy is inclined by an angle of about 53° to the line of sight from the Earth, which is oriented at a position angle of 172°. 

==Properties==
It is categorized as a double-barred spiral galaxy with a small inner bulge through the core along with an outer bulge. The nucleus displays a weak level of activity of the LINER2 type. Variations in ultraviolet emission from the core suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole. Estimates for the mass of this object range from to solar masses ().

On May 9, 1998 a supernova was discovered in this galaxy by Mirko Villi. Designated SN 1998bu, this was a Type Ia supernova explosion. It reached maximum brightness on May 21 at about magnitude 11.6, then steadily faded. Observations of the ejecta a year later showed creation of 0.4 solar masses of iron. The spectrum of the supernova remnant confirmed too radioactive 56Co, which decays into 56Fe.

Messier 96 is about the same mass and size as the Milky Way. It is a very asymmetric galaxy; its dust and gas are unevenly spread throughout its weak spiral arms, and its core is just offset from the midpoint of its extremes. Its arms are also asymmetrical, thought to have been influenced by the gravitational pull of other galaxies within its group.

Messier 96 is being studied as part of a survey of 50 nearby galaxies known as the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS), providing an unprecedented view of star formation within the local universe.

==M96 group==

M96 is the brightest galaxy within the M96 Group, a group of galaxies in Leo, the other Messier objects of which are M95 and M105. To this are added at least nine other galaxies.

This is the nearest group to the Local Group to combine bright spirals and a bright elliptical galaxy (Messier 105).

<text>Juha Harri &quot;Junnu&quot; Vainio, also known as Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio (10 May 1938 in Kotka, Finland – 29 October 1990, Gryon, Switzerland) was a Finnish lyricist, singer, composer and teacher. With the lyrics or music to over 2,400 songs to his name, Vainio is one of Finland&#x27;s most prolific lyricists along with Sauvo Puhtila, Reino Helismaa and Vexi Salmi. Vainio enjoyed a short professional career as a teacher at Kymenranta Primary School.

Vainio began writing songs in the early 1960s and continued until his death. Apart from his home town Kotka, he lived for several years in Helsinki and Espoo. In his last years Vainio lived in Gryon, Switzerland, where he died of a heart attack in October 1990. He is buried in the family grave in Helsinki.

He was given the nickname &quot;Watt&quot; on account of a song on his first solo record, the 1964 &quot;Paras rautalankayhtye&quot; (&quot;The Best Rautalanka Band&quot;). Never used by itself, the nickname was always part of &quot;Juha Watt Vainio&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Family and childhood ===

Juha Harri Vainio was born on May 10, 1938, in Kotka, the first child of Tauno and Kaarina Vainio. He spent much of his early childhood in Vuoksenniska, Imatra. his two siblings were Marja (born 1944) and Markku (born 1946).

Vainio&#x27;s grandfather, Emil Alajääski (born 1881), changed his name to Vainio soon after the turn of the century. Vainio&#x27;s family on his father&#x27;s side boasted many athletes whilst Kaarina Vainio had some athletic background. After becoming engaged to Kaarina in 1937, Tauno Vainio worked in Vuoksenniska as a regional head of the White Guard, and was known as a man of principle. Kaarina Vainio had a middle school education, and Tauno Vainio had graduated as a trade technician.

As a child, Juha Vainio loved singing and the family&#x27;s neighbours often asked him to come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people&#x27;s anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, but on the other hand admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song &quot;Eräänlainen sotaveteraani&quot; (&quot;Some Kind of War Veteran&quot;), on the album &quot;Sellaista elämä on&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s How Life Is&quot;), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother&#x27;s cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.

In 1945, the Vainios moved into a detached house in Metsola where they lived until 1950 before moving again to Kotkansaari, in the centre of Kotka. Juha Vainio recalled that the most beautiful years of his childhood were spent in Metsola. It was there that he met Nestori Miikkulainen, four years his senior and who later featured in Vainio&#x27;s song &quot;Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä&quot; (&quot;Moustached Bachelors&quot;). Vainio often spent time in the harbour of Kotka with his friends. He was fond of the sea throughout his life.

As a child Juha Vainio was diagnosed with congenital heart disease, causing his lips to turn blue, and the onset of rapid breathlessness. He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 at the same time as his mother suffered an attack of tuberculosis from which she later recovered. Juha was at first kept in the adults&#x27; ward due to the serious nature of the operation, but later transferred to the children&#x27;s ward to recover. He soon went home and began to get better.

=== School ===
Juha Vainio&#x27;s education did not start well. Frustrated with school he was once absent for three weeks without permission. After primary school he attended a gymnasium in Kotka. At the same time his family moved from Metsola to Kotkansaari. During his school years, Vainio&#x27;s best friend was Risto &quot;Tiso&quot; Warjus, two years his senior. They both sang in the Kotka Gymnasium choir. Vaino&#x27;s music teacher at the gymnasium, Arvo Vainio, was nicknamed &quot;Junnu&quot; on account of his big nose resembling that of a comic book character of the same name. Later on the name was given to Juha Vainio because he had the same surname as the teacher.

When he was fifteen, Vainio felt sure he would become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became apparent in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt that it could not be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change his mind. He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.

Around 1957 Vainio&#x27;s family moved from the centre of Kotka to near the harbour. After a few years they moved again, this time to a neighbourhood near Sibeliuspuisto. From childhood, Juha Vainio practiced sport even though before surgery he had suffered from heart problems. He liked football and basketball, which were very popular in Kotka and also practiced high jump together with Tiso Warjus. After his heart operation, Juha&#x27;s physical condition deteriorated, but doing sport helped him improve it.

=== First contact with music ===
Juha Vainio became interested in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio&#x27;s mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.

In late 1956 Vainio lived next door to one of his musician friends, Heikki Kauppinen, who was three years his senior. Vainio also became acquainted with drummer Erkki Liikanen. The friends had different tastes in music with Olli Miettinen and Reijo &quot;Rempo&quot; Tani listening to jazz, while Vainio liked schlager music. Vainio later named and described many of his friends in his song lyrics.

Vainio was called up in 1957 for service in the Finnish army. He was 19 years old and in the penultimate grade of gymnasium. However, he did not want to start his military service right after the matriculation exams, because he wanted to find a profession first. The next spring, the last year of gymnasium, he decided to go to Paris for the holidays with his friend Pekka. Vainio was supposed to pass his matriculation exams in the spring of 1959, but he failed the Swedish exam and had to wait until the autumn to pass it.

=== Fatherhood, teaching and military service ===
In Fennia, Juha Vainio met his future wife Taina Kaukonen. When Taina became pregnant in early 1960, Juha&#x27;s parents scolded the young father. As a result, the couple married in the summer of 1960 and a son Ilkka followed in October of the same year. Juha and Taina had three more children: Sami in 1961, Kalle in 1963 and Kati in 1967. At first the young couple lived at Juha&#x27;s parents&#x27;, but moved to Helsinki when Juha started his studies there. He studied at the &quot;Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu&quot; (School of Social Sciences, which later became the University of Tampere) and later the &quot;Opettajakorkeakoulu&quot; (School of Vocational Teacher Education) where he graduated as a school teacher.

Juha Vainio taught higher classes at Yläpää Primary School where the pupils informally called him &quot;Junnu&quot;. His teaching methods were relaxed, such as making the pupils sing a children&#x27;s song instead of a hymn in the morning. The pupils could also eat and watch television with Vainio. In 1964 he had a temporary absence from teaching due to military service. Already having some reputation as a lyricist, whilst in the army Vainio was assigned to write the lyrics for the new cadence of the Karelia Brigade. Vainio finished his military service in the autumn of 1964, at the age of 26.

=== Breakthrough ===
Vainio&#x27;s musical influences included Tapio Rautavaara, Georg Malmstén and Henry Theel. As a young man he trained to play music because he wanted to become a professional musician. He started writing lyrics for friends&#x27; bands, and his texts brought him some fame. Vainio was above all a lyricist; he wrote lyrics or music for over 2,400 published songs, the majority of which were recorded by others. Many of Vainio&#x27;s lyrics were written for Toivo Kärki&#x27;s compositions. He translated popular foreign songs into Finnish, work that he later abandoned since translators only received a fixed payment for their work rather than royalties.

At the beginning of his career, comedian Spede Pasanen asked Vainio and his friends to play in a radio show called &quot;Ruljanssiriihi&quot; (&quot;Thrashing House of Rigmarole&quot;). The band accepted, and after Pasanen gave up the radio show to start his television career, the musicians followed him. They played in Pasanen&#x27;s shows including &quot;Speden saluuna&quot; (&quot;Spede&#x27;s Saloon&quot;) and &quot;50 pientä minuuttia&quot; (&quot;50 Small Minutes&quot;).

With the help of his friend Erkki Liikanen, Vainio got a record deal with recording company Finndisc. His debut single, &quot;Paras rautalankayhtye&quot; was recorded in 1964. At the same time Vainio received the nickname &quot;Watt&quot;, which was printed on the front cover of the single. Vainio wrote lyrics for several performers, including Katri Helena. In 1965 his parents and siblings moved to Helsinki, and at about the same time Vainio and his family moved to Espoo, where they lived for over 25 years. In 1966 he lost a good friend when Olli Miettinen died at the age of 34.

Vainio&#x27;s songs &quot;Mistä löydän ystävän&quot; (&quot;Where Do I Find a Friend&quot;) and &quot;Maanantaitango&quot; (&quot;Monday Tango&quot;) had already been recorded by Katri Helena in 1963 before Vainio&#x27;s military service. After leaving the army, Vainio befriended composer and music journalist Sauvo Puhtila (known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym Saukki), who told him that Yleisradio was in need of lyricists. Eager to leave his job as a teacher, Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino Markkula. Their song &quot;Sä kuulut päivään jokaiseen&quot; (&quot;You Belong in Every Day&quot;), composed by Markkula with lyrics by Vainio, was given to Eino Grön who made it into a hit.

Vainio worked at Fazer Music as a lyricist with monthly salary and at the same time wrote his own songs. He translated several international hits into Finnish, including &quot;Piilopaikka&quot; (&quot;Hideout&quot;, originally &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Your Troubles&quot;) by Danny and &quot;Nyt meni hermot&quot; (&quot;Now I&#x27;m Furious&quot;), which became the breakthrough recording of pop group &quot;The First&quot;. Vainio was often late for arranged studio sessions, which irritated the bands and the company&#x27;s management. At 30, Vainio wrote one of his best-known translations, Fredi&#x27;s &quot;Kolmatta linjaa takaisin&quot; (&quot;Back along Kolmas Linja&quot;). Another success was his translation of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, recorded by Pepe Willberg as &quot;Rööperiin&quot; (&quot;To Rööperi&quot;). Although Vainio&#x27;s version is set in Helsinki, he has said he was thinking about Kotka when he wrote the lyrics.

In addition to writing songs for others, Vainio became a popular solo artist. He also wrote the music to several of his songs, despite never considering himself a singer or a composer but above all a lyricist. At first he worked with Pertti Metsärinne&#x27;s orchestra, recording the song &quot;Hum-Boogie&quot; (wordplay on the word &quot;humpuuki&quot;, meaning &quot;humbug&quot;). Among his first recorded songs were &quot;Jos vain saisin nastahampaan takaisin&quot; (&quot;If Only I Would Get the Spike Tooth Back&quot;) from 1964 and &quot;Suolaa, suolaa, enemmän suolaa&quot; (&quot;Salt, Salt, More Salt&quot;) along with &quot;Juhannustanssit&quot; (&quot;Midsummer&#x27;s Ball&quot;) from 1965. All were included on Vainio&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio&quot;.

In the mid-1960s Vainio had success with &quot;Sellanen ol&#x27; Viipuri&quot; (&quot;Such Was Viipuri&quot;), &quot;Turistit tuppukylään&quot; (&quot;Tourists Arrive in the Small Town&quot;) and a song written with Erik Lindström, &quot;Herrat Helsingin&quot; (&quot;Big Shots of Helsinki&quot;). When the Finndisc company was sold to Scandia, Vainio and Lindström&#x27;s collaboration ended. Vaino soon afterwards became acquainted with composer Jaakko Salo, who was introduced to him by Saukki. He started writing lyrics for composer Toivo Kärki, who had lost his primary lyricist Reino Helismaa in January 1965.

Well-known songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s included &quot;Suomi–Ruotsi&quot; (&quot;Finland–Sweden&quot;) and the 1971 release &quot;Matkarakastaja&quot; (&quot;Travelling Lover&quot;), which met with criticism. While Vainio&#x27;s early albums were collections of singles, he recorded his first proper studio album in 1972. The album &quot;Viisari värähtää&quot; (&quot;The Pointer Twitches&quot;) included the song &quot;Kaunissaari&quot; (a reference to a place in Finland), which Vainio recorded several times during his career. It was also included on his next album, &quot;Tulin, näin ja soitin&quot; (&quot;I Came, I Saw, I Played&quot;), which was released in 1975. Although &quot;Matkarakastaja&quot; and &quot;Viisari värähtää&quot; were Vainio&#x27;s earliest published compositions, it was not until the late 1970s that he began to compose music more actively.

In 1966 Vainio befriended Vexi Salmi and Irwin Goodman. The trio made a summer tour called &quot;Kansalle mitä kansa haluaa&quot; (&quot;Give People What the People Want&quot;) but at times Vainio was too intoxicated to perform. Vainio and Reijo Tani made a collection of singles in 1968 called &quot;Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio ja Reijo Tani&quot;. The album included Vainio&#x27;s &quot;Kauhea kankkunen&quot; (&quot;Horrible Hangover&quot;) and &quot;Vanha salakuljettaja Laitinen&quot; (&quot;Old Smuggler Laitinen&quot;), which were both collaborations with Toivo Kärki. The latter song was named after Keijo Laitinen, a good friend of Vainio&#x27;s. In 1970 Vainio started writing causeries with Gunnar Mattsson.

=== Back to teaching ===
Vainio returned to teaching in the early 1970s. Vainio made up nicknames for all his pupils, who in return called him Junnu. He had a habit of coming up with very unorthodox methods of punishment but in general got on well with his pupils.
Often late and in the habit of leaving a lot of paperwork unfinished, shortly before he quit teaching Vainio organized an excursion for the pupils to express his gratitude for the time he had spent with them.

=== Alcohol use ===
As time went by, Vainio consumed more and more alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case he ran out of something to drink. Vainio&#x27;s deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.

Vainio&#x27;s friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit drinking in 1972, and at first Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that he was supposed to have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio&#x27;s composition. Vainio&#x27;s alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to quit drinking for good.

Vainio was supported by his friends who had quit drinking a few years earlier, such as Osmo &quot;Osku&quot; Kanerva. Eino Grön, a friend of Vainio&#x27;s, decided to follow his example and managed to quit a year and a half after Vainio. Vainio never wanted to be called a teetotaler and considered himself a recovered alcoholic. After he quit drinking, Vainio&#x27;s songs became more serious and more sensitive, although he still wrote humorous lyrics as well.

Although Vainio himself did not consume alcohol, he was tolerant about others&#x27; alcohol use and could spend time with his friends even if they drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio&#x27;s domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.

=== Changes ===

After his divorce, Vainio&#x27;s life slowly began to change. Creatively he was more prolific than ever in the late 1970s and 1980s. He began composing in addition to writing lyrics. He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo, and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written.

In 1976 Vainio&#x27;s &quot;Jawohl, jawohl&quot; from &quot;Kansi kiinni ja kuulemiin&quot; (&quot;Shut the Lid and Goodbye&quot;) was criticized for its commentary about German tourists who visit Lapland. The album also featured a sensitive song, &quot;Mä uskon huomispäivään&quot; (&quot;I Believe in Tomorrow&quot;). Other well-known songs from the album are &quot;Playboy 60 v&quot; (&quot;Playboy 60 yrs&quot;), &quot;Suomi–Ruotsi&quot; (&quot;Finland–Sweden&quot;) and &quot;Taas lapsuuden maisemiin&quot; (&quot;Back Again to Where I Grew Up&quot;).

Vainio began composing actively in the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions at the beginning of the decade. His earliest compositions include &quot;Matkarakastaja&quot; and &quot;Viisari värähtää&quot;. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is &quot;Käyn ahon laitaa&quot; (&quot;I Walk by the Side of a Glade&quot;) from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already quit drinking, he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became evident in his next albums. 1981&#x27;s &quot;Albatrossi ja sorsa&quot; (&quot;The Albatross and the Duck&quot;) contains one of Vainio&#x27;s most well-known songs, &quot;Albatrossi&quot;. The topic of the song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is &quot;Apteekin ovikello&quot; (&quot;The Pharmacy Doorbell&quot;), the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were &quot;Panaman konsuli&quot; (&quot;The Consul of Panama&quot;) and &quot;Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään&quot; (&quot;When I Started Drinking&quot;).

In 1976, Vainio was hired to write a number of bawdy songs which were later released on cassette tape. Vainio wrote a part of the songs and sang on the record with all musicians using pseudonyms, Vainio&#x27;s being &quot;Junnu Kaihomieli&quot;. Many of the songs were based on a familiar melody whose copyright had already expired; for example, the song &quot;Kumi-Roope&quot; (&quot;Rubber Roope&quot;) was an obscene version of the folk song &quot;Rosvo-Roope&quot; (&quot;Roope the Robber&quot;). In 1979 Vainio participated in another recording of similar songs. The songs were released on compact disc in 1992 and 1997 as &quot;Pahojen poikien lauluja 1–2&quot; (&quot;Bad Boys&#x27; Songs 1–2&quot;) and &quot;Porno-ooppera / Pahojen poikien lauluja 3&quot; (&quot;Porn Opera / Bad Boys&#x27; Songs 3&quot;). Both records went gold.

In 1982 Vainio collaborated with bodybuilder Kike Elomaa when they sang together on the single &quot;Kunto nousee sullakin&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ll Get in Shape Too&quot;), with lyrics by Vainio. The B-side of the single was &quot;Pokkana ja paikallaan&quot; (&quot;Serious and Still&quot;), sung by Elomaa alone. A compilation album called &quot;Sellaista elämä on&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s How Life Is&quot;) followed in 1983, consisting of the most popular songs Vainio had himself recorded. 1985&#x27;s &quot;Elämää ja erotiikkaa&quot; (&quot;Life and Erotica&quot;) was Vainio&#x27;s last finished studio album. Popular pieces from the album included &quot;Aleks ja Jaan&quot; (&quot;Aleks and Jaan&quot;), &quot;Heiskasen kanssa kun heiluttiin&quot; (&quot;When We Hung Out with Heiskanen&quot;) and &quot;Yksinäinen saarnipuu&quot; (&quot;Lonely Ash Tree&quot;).

After his divorce, Vainio had started dating Pirkko Heikkala. The couple were married on 27 December 1981 in Kuusamo. In 1983 they had a daughter, Suvi. The couple moved to Switzerland in the late 1980s. In 1988 Katri Helena, Eino Grön, Pave Maijanen and other popular artists performed at a concert organized to celebrate Vainio&#x27;s 50th birthday.

=== Death ===

Vainio&#x27;s childhood heart problems surfaced again in 1990 with his sister Marja recalling that he often placed his hand over his heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio had to go to the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio&#x27;s life by quickly forcing him to vomit.

Vainio gave his last performance on 12 October 1990. He died of a heart attack in his home in Gryon, Switzerland, on October 29, 1990, in the arms of his wife. He was 52 years old. A burial ceremony was held in the town of Vevey, and Vainio&#x27;s body brought back to Finland and buried in the family grave in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

The day before he died, Vainio had become friends with ice hockey coach Juhani Tamminen and dined with his family. According to Tamminen, Vainio had been in good condition at the time. The following week Tamminen learned of Vainio&#x27;s death from a friend who had read about it in a Finnish newspaper.

The record Vainio had worked on during the final years of his life was released posthumously by Scandia in 1991 as &quot;Viiskymppisen viisut&quot; (&quot;Tunes of a Fifty-year-old&quot;). Especially important for Vainio had been the song &quot;Kauan sitten&quot; (&quot;Long Ago&quot;) which he had recorded in the early 1970s. Vainio&#x27;s most important collaborator during his last years was producer Jaakko Salo.

== Nicknames and pseudonyms ==
Juha Vainio&#x27;s best-known nicknames were Junnu and Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio. Junnu was a familiar name also used in connection with his last name as Junnu Vainio. The name Juha &quot;Watt&quot; Vainio was used on the cover of several albums and was a name he was publicly known by. Vainio&#x27;s friends never used the nickname Watt – for them he always remained Junnu.

Among the pseudonyms used by Vainio were Junnu, Junnu Kaihomieli, Jorma Koski, Ilkka Lähde, Mirja Lähde, Kirsi Sunila and Heikki Ilmari. The name Junnu Kaihomieli was used for Vainio&#x27;s bawdy songs in the late 1970s.

== Critical commentary ==
Peter von Bagh regards Vainio as the pioneer of Finnish 1960s humorous songs since he began their composition before Irwin Goodman. Producer Jaakko Salo commented that Vainio&#x27;s career found a new start once Vainio quit drinking. According to him, it is evident from Vainio&#x27;s texts that his songs are based on his own experiences.

According to writer and film director Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics at the same time as the music. This is evident in the song &quot;Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä&quot;, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.

== Hobbies ==
Vainio frequently played football and basketball in his youth and later on remained an enthusiastic spectator. He wrote the lyrics for ice-hockey team Tappara&#x27;s anthem &quot;Tappara on terästä&quot; (&quot;Tappara Is Made of Steel&quot;), which was composed by Reijo Lehtovirta in 1976. Tappara&#x27;s manager Mikko Westberg asked Vainio to write a song for the team, requesting that the lyrics contain the phrases &quot;Tappara is made of steel&quot; and &quot;rye bread&quot;. Vainio became a lifetime fan of Tappara after writing the song.

Vainio was fond of the sea and sailing. He often took his family and friends sailing in his boat, and in 1987 bought an island in Österskär with his wife Pirkko. His love for sailing is evident in the song &quot;Kaikki paitsi purjehdus on turhaa&quot; (&quot;Everything But Sailing Is Pointless&quot;), which was composed by Lasse Mårtenson.

== Legacy ==
Since Vainio&#x27;s death many tribute concerts have been staged, with an event to celebrate his 70th birthday taking place in May 2008. Vainio&#x27;s friend, songwriter Jukka Virtanen, wrote a play called &quot;Albatrossi ja Heiskanen&quot; (&quot;The Albatross and Heiskanen&quot;) based on Vainio&#x27;s songs. It was first performed in his hometown Kotka in 1992 and has been performed many times since. The Finnish film &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Empire&quot;) describes the youth of Vainio and his friends in Kotka during the 1950s.

The &quot;Juha Vainio Award&quot; (Juha Vainio-palkinto) for writers was introduced in 1991 and is given annually to notable Finnish lyricists with yearly prize money of 5,000 euros (previously 30,000 Finnish markkas). In December 1994, a club named &quot;Junnun Lauluseura&quot; (Junnu&#x27;s singing club) was established. Its members include Vainio&#x27;s friends Keijo Laitinen, Pertti Metsärinne and Reijo Tani. The club has published two books entitled &quot;Junnun laululipas 1&quot; and &quot;Junnun laululipas 2&quot;.

Vainio&#x27;s work continues to have major relevance in Finnish popular music, an example of which being two Vainio cover albums by Vesa-Matti Loiri in 2003 and 2004.

All of the songs that Vainio recorded were published in 2008 in a CD boxed set &quot;Legendan laulut – Kaikki levytykset 1963–1990&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Legend – All Recordings 1963–1990&quot;). It included his advertising jingles, bawdy songs and a book. A compilation album released with the boxed set called &quot;Legendan laulut – 48 mestariteosta&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Legend – 48 Masterpieces&quot;) reached second place on the Finnish album charts. Juha Vainio&#x27;s son is in the music business and works as a music producer and songwriter.

<text>Hits Radio South Yorkshire, formerly Hallam FM, is an Independent Local Radio station based in Sheffield, England, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to South Yorkshire and Chesterfield.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 330,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==

The station started broadcasting on 1548 kHz/194m AM, 95.2 and 95.9 MHz FM under the name of Radio Hallam from its studios at Hartshead in Sheffield city centre on 1 October 1974. The first presenter heard on air was ex-BBC Radio 1 DJ Johnny Moran – the first record he played was &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Music in Me&quot; by Kiki Dee, which stuck after a minute and a half.

On 1 October 1985, Radio Hallam&#x27;s broadcast area significantly increased when it began to broadcast to all of South Yorkshire. In 1987, Radio Hallam merged with neighbouring Yorkshire stations Pennine Radio in Bradford and Viking Radio in Hull to form the now-defunct Yorkshire Radio Network.

The frequencies were changed during the 1980s to 96.1 FM for Rotherham, 97.4 FM for Sheffield, 102.9 FM for Barnsley, and 103.4 for the remainder of South Yorkshire. After a take-over of the parent company YRN by the Metro Radio Group, the AM frequency became Great Yorkshire Gold. As part of Hallam&#x27;s licence agreement, the Rotherham transmitter ceased to be used by the station in the 1990s. Hallam also moved its studio facilities to 900 Herries Road, close to Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s Hillsborough ground. The office space at Hartshead was formerly used by the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; newspaper.

As the Metro Radio Group was bought by EMAP, Hallam FM also became part of the Big City Network in Northern England. In 2011, Bauer Media&#x27;s Big City Network was replaced by the Place Portfolio, containing the group&#x27;s local radio stations.

In 2016, Hallam FM was the &quot;Station of the Year&quot; at that year&#x27;s ARIAS Radio Awards.

From late 2019 until early 2020 Hallam FM&#x27;s Sheffield studios were shared with sister Yorkshire station Viking FM, following the closure of Viking&#x27;s studios in Hull. Viking FM was then moved to co-locate with Pulse 1 in Leeds.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 10 January 2024, station owners Bauer announced Hallam FM would be rebranded as Hits Radio South Yorkshire on 17 April 2024, as part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales. The announcement signalled the end of the Radio Hallam brand after nearly 50 years of broadcasting.

The station&#x27;s local programming was not affected by the relaunch.

==Broadcasting==
The station broadcasts on three analogue frequencies. Almost the whole region is covered on 103.4 FM from a transmitter at Clifton, near the M18 as well as on 97.4 FM (Tapton Hill, Sheffield) and 102.9 FM (Ardsley) which boosts reception in Sheffield, Doncaster and Barnsley. The station also broadcasts via DAB on the Bauer Radio South Yorkshire multiplex, and online via their app.

==Programming==
Networked programming originates from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester studios.

The station&#x27;s only remaining local programme is the long-running &quot;Big John @ Breakfast&quot;, which is produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Sheffield studios and airs weekdays from 6–10 am. The show has been on air since 2000 and is presented by &quot;Big&quot; John Harrison and Liesl Soards. During its time on air, the show has been recognised by the wider radio industry, most notably as winner of the &quot;Best Breakfast Show&quot; Gold award at the 2002 New York Radio Awards and as &quot;Breakfast Show of the Year&quot; at the 2015 Arqiva Radio Awards.

===News===
Bauer&#x27;s Sheffield newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6 am–7 pm on weekdays, and from 7 am–1 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, usually originating from Bauer&#x27;s Leeds newsroom.

===Big John @ Breakfast===

Big John @ Breakfast is the current breakfast show on Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and has been on air since 2000. It is presented by &quot;Big&quot; John Harrison and Liesl Soards, along with producer James Crookes. The show is broadcast live across South Yorkshire weekdays from 6am to 10am and it is now the only locally produced programme on the station.

<doc id="974920" wikidata="Q59879" url="?curid=974920" title="Giovanni Giustiniani">
<text>Giovanni Giustiniani Longo (; ; 1418 – 1 June 1453) was a Genoese nobleman, mercenary captain, and defender of Constantinople during its siege in 1453. He was instrumental in its defense and commanded 700 men, as well as leading the land forces protecting the city.

== Family and early life ==
Giustiniani was a member of the powerful House of Doria and was probably native to the island of Chios. Although little is known of his origin, Giustiniani was known to be a mercenary soldier, which indicates that he was likely not the first born son of his family, as mercenary nobles typically chose that life due to not being owed the family inheritance.

== The state of Byzantium in 1400 ==
The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, had endured from 330 AD all the way to the fifteenth century. While it was originally a major power in the Eastern Mediterranean that outlasted many neighboring and competing empires, it had declined significantly in both influence and territory approaching the middle of the fifteenth century. Its many conflicts with neighboring states had seen its borders slowly pushed back. The loss that had the most influence on the state of Byzantium at the time of its fall was its temporary dissolution in 1204 when European crusaders conquered the city of Constantinople and drove the remaining Byzantine loyalists out of their seat of power. Though it was eventually reclaimed, and imperial authority restored, it would decidedly put an end to Byzantium&#x27;s status as a major military power. Byzantium now only retained limited regional influence and had to contend with a younger and more militarily focused neighbor known as the Ottoman Empire looking to expand west into their territory.

By the time of the final siege of Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to a single city. A city that, while impressively resilient against attack, had been sacked and conquered before by both internal Byzantine rebellions and the aforementioned crusaders. What made those conquests different than what the Byzantines faced in 1453 is that Byzantium had other land still under their control to regroup in and launch a re-conquest from. In 1453, there was essentially nothing else but Constantinople; No buffer territory before the city and neither the resources nor the staging ground to retake the city if it was lost. Their ability to set up defenses against future attacks were also heavily hampered due to the fact that the empire was financially in a crisis and was unable to raise money through taxation because of Venetian resident&#x27;s threats of evacuation if trade was further taxed which would have crippled its economy. Furthermore, the harsh conditions created in the city due to the previously listed factors had created factionalism. This ranged from religious and ethnic tensions to the formation of outright loyalist and separatist factions. By the time of the siege, there were pro-Byzantines, pro-Ottomans and neutral factions all occupying the same city.

== Opposing forces ==
The final factor that sets up the context of the state of Constantinople was the death of Ottoman Sultan Murad II, who had pursued a generally peaceful coexistence with Byzantium towards the end of his life. When he died, his son Mehmed II succeeded him and with a new ruler came a new Ottoman foreign diplomacy policy regarding the Byzantine Empire, though this change would only come after an initial renewal of the peace treaty between the two empires.

== Mercenary demand and motives ==
Giustiniani&#x27;s presence during the defense can be deduced by the state of Italian city state rivalries and how it drove Italian mercenaries abroad. When there was conflict within what would be constituted as modern-day Italy between city states, the employment of mercenaries was not only commonplace, but the preferred method of fielding soldiers. But with the conflicts within Italy somewhat winding down and the local governments shifting to standing armies, the need for mercenaries in Italy had essentially dried up. In order to continue operating in large mercenary companies, Italian soldiers for hire would have to hire themselves out to foreign conflicts wherever there happened to be fighting and a side willing to hire them. Furthermore, for the mercenaries from the Italian city-states, Christian Byzantines made practical sense as an avenue for their employment; both for money and the shared religion.

Though practical business needs likely accounted for most mercenaries that ended up in Constantinople, there are also other rationales which likely drew mercenaries into service. The city hosted a rather large Venetian civilian population, and smaller populations from the region such as a neighborhood of Genoese civilians. For a Venetian or Genoese mercenary, it was very likely to have prior relationships within Constantinople; and this applied to any group who had a section of their population within Constantinople. As a result, mercenaries could be drawn to the job not only by the practical needs of their job, but also a need to protect people they knew. Furthermore, there is a precedent for mercenary nobles convicted of crimes to be sent to defend a Christian stronghold in order to seek redemption. While Giovanni Giustiniani, the mercenary put in charge of Constantinople&#x27;s defense, never left a surviving testimony as to why he elected to serve at the Siege of Constantinople, we can deduce that much like other mercenaries at the time the context behind his decision had to do with one or several of these three explanations. Reportedly, the emperor Constantine XI had promised him sovereignty over the island of Lemnos in case of victory. 

It is important to note here that the Byzantine Empire had a long history of dealing with internal rebellions from native born military officers. This trend of rebellion alongside a streak of seeming incompetence bred active distrust between the Emperor and his military officers. As a result of which the Byzantines had begun heavily relying on mercenaries from the thirteenth century onwards. Although rebellions by mercenaries were not an uncommon occurrence, the frequency was considerably less than native born rebellions. That may be a possible reason for his promotion as the leader of the defense instead of a native-born officer; both fear of rebellion and two centuries of trust built hired mercenary officers. In addition, the thirteenth century was the advent of military professionalism in mercenary companies that transformed them from simple sell sword hordes to groups of professional soldiers with an updated understanding of the modern military technology. With that in mind, it is reasonable to assume that the Emperor sought a mercenary to lead the defense not only due to trust issues, but also a professional mercenary was more likely to understand military technology vital to properly organize the defense.

== Siege of Constantinople ==
Upon hearing of the plight of Constantinople, Giustiniani (along with 700 men from Chios and Genoa) sailed to defend the city, arriving in late January to prepare for the siege. Constantine XI strategically placed this contingent to the right of his own position, and appointed Giustiniani to the rank of Protostrator. This placed him as the leader of the city&#x27;s defense, and while it is clear why such a position would go to a mercenary, it is less clear why Giustiniani specifically was selected. One potential explanation comes from the fact that many of the defenders present were Venetian and there was also a quite large Venetian civilian population that was discontent with Constantine&#x27;s rule. The last time the city fell out of Byzantine control is when a group of European crusaders, that had many Venetians among them, took it in 1204. So, it is not out of the question that Constantine was wary of selecting a Venetian to lead the defense in case they attempted a military coup with civilian support afterwards. Following this line of logic, Giustiniani was from The Republic of Genoa, which the Venetians seemed to be prejudiced against. Selecting Giustiniani meant that Constantine had a Protostrator who would not aid the Venetians in the event they attempted to launch a coup, and that they also would find themselves with fewer volunteers to assist in their own potential coup as there were comparatively fewer Genoese mercenaries and civilians than Venetians.

Once selected as Protostrator, he was tasked with training soldiers, reinforcing fortifications, and generally preparing for the imminent attack. Learning from the siege of 1422, he directed the defense efforts at the outer walls, with Archbishop Leonardo di Chio&#x27;s suggestion that the inner walls defence would not be prioritized due to their supposed disrepair. During this stage, there was no manpower deficiency, though it became clear that there would only be 8,000-9,000 people to defend Constantinople. Noting that the city lacked funds to pay its defenders, Constantine used church jewelry and silverware to mint coins to pay the soldiers. Giustiniani was placed on the right of the most strategic and lowest lying section of the walls, between St. Romanos and Charisius. Immediately, he reorganised the army, trained the city&#x27;s recruits in modern weaponry, and removed men who had fled to monasteries with the hope of escaping military duties, instead directing them to Constantinople&#x27;s defensive efforts. Giustiniani also reinforced the wall&#x27;s most critical points with his 700 Genoese mercenaries.

Upon Sultan Mehmed&#x27;s arrival on April 6, Giustiniani began commanding sorties to counterattack the Ottoman position. These are recorded as being very successful, and resulted in the destruction of Ottoman troops, siege works and artillery. However, sorties were gradually abandoned due to their high death rates. His approach regarding wall repairs was also a hindrance to the Ottomans; his strategy involved cushioning the blow of artillery fire by covering the walls in soft surfaces, and then filling gaps created by cannonballs with debris (which turned out to be highly effective as the cannonballs would simply sink into the rubble). This tactic was impressive both due to its effectiveness given his limited resources, but also the fact this was his first time actively defending against the range and quantity of artillery the Ottomans were using. Giovanni had to contend with a massive, 6-meter-long cannon supported by a few dozen large cannons and 500 smaller artillery pieces, one of the largest artillery barrages in history at the time. The unprecedented nature of the Ottoman artillery meant that Giustiniani likely neither knew the extent of his enemy&#x27;s artillery nor knew how to defend against artillery on that scale, but rather he came up with defensive plans during the siege. The quick thinking displayed in such a solution likely indicates that Giustiniani&#x27;s defense was as effective as it was because he was an adaptive leader. Throughout the siege, Giustiniani and his men repaired the damaged walls, plugging gaps with soldiers to repel assaults when necessary. He also made use of small artillery pieces containing grapeshot, projectiles and items to drop on attackers attempting to scale the walls.

The first assault occurred on 18 April, with a detachment of Janissaries and archers being sent towards a breach in the middle section of the walls. Giustiniani and his men were able to repel this attack after 4 hours due to the narrow front — as the breach had been a small one, the Ottoman troops were unable to take advantage of their superior numbers.

By late May, dwindling supplies and manpower coupled with the knowledge that no relief army would save Constantinople caused tensions to run high, and amidst this Giustiniani and Notaras (the Byzantine chief minister) are reported to have had a falling out.

== Death ==

In the early hours of 29 May, the final Ottoman assault began, with the most numerous forces concentrated in the center of the walls. The first wave of troops, Christian troops provided by vassals of Mehmed, attempted to scale the improvised stockades erected by Giustiniani&#x27;s men, but were unsuccessful. A second wave proceeded to attack, most notably at a breach near the St. Romanos gate, but were once again repelled by early morning. The last wave consisted of elite Janissaries, who assaulted the wall and by this point were faced by no more than 3,000 exhausted troops led by Giustiniani.

Giustiniani&#x27;s downfall came during this assault, when a cannon or crossbow bolt severely wounded his arm, chest or leg, forcing a retreat from his combat station. As he exited the battle, the defenders&#x27; morale was severely weakened and men began to flee in panic. Giustiniani was taken to his ship with hopes of his wounds being cared for, and as it became known that Constantinople had fallen, fled alongside his men. Sources hostile towards the Genoese (such as the Venetian Nicolò Barbaro), however, report that he was only lightly wounded or not wounded at all, but, overwhelmed by fear, simulated the wound to abandon the battlefield, determining the fall of the city. These charges of cowardice and treason were so widespread that the Republic of Genoa had to deny them by sending diplomatic letters to the Chancelleries of England, France, the Duchy of Burgundy and others.

Giustiniani succumbed to his wounds on 1 June, and was taken to the Genoese island of Chios. He was laid to rest at the Church of San Domenico in Pyrgi, Chios and although his tomb is lost (possibly from the 1881 earthquake), several descriptions survive.

== Primary sources ==
The most prevalent primary source which mention Giovanni Giustiniani is Nicolò Barbaro&#x27;s &quot;The Siege of Constantinople in 1453&quot; in which he gives his own eyewitness account of what occurred during the fall of Constantinople. The work covers both the siege itself and the immediate aftermath with Barbaro&#x27;s biases laid clear upon the page. Giustiniani appears in the text under the name Zuan Zustignan and is portrayed as a coward that fled his post and lied to the populace about the Ottomans breaking in to spread panic. Barbaro&#x27;s recollection of Giustiniani&#x27;s defense of the wall is contested by other historians as it is misleading in the details it leaves out and likely false as he is the only source which says that Giustiniani caused mass panic. But due to his source being a primary source, his otherwise accurate depiction of the fall of Constantinople, and his status as being one of the first people to write about Giovanni Giustiniani, his source often merits discussion when Giustiniani is mentioned by name.

== Historiography ==
The first relevant secondary source to Giovanni Giustiniani&#x27;s story came around in 2006 with William Caferro&#x27;s &quot;John Hawkwood an English Mercenary in Fourteenth-Century Italy&quot;. And while it has no direct mention of Giustiniani in it, it does exposit about Italian mercenaries in the fourteenth century and provide some potential background for Giustiniani&#x27;s life before the fall of Constantinople. It mentions that, in Italy, the practice of mercenary companies had largely fallen out of favor by the 1400s in favor of standing armies and individual captains leading a smaller host of mercenaries. While not being directly about him, it gives more information about how since mercenary work was scarcer in Italy there was a need for travel and what potential organizational structure he fit into before arriving at Constantinople. And the idea that mercenary companies no longer had as good of a chance at business in Italy and thus would have to find work elsewhere is supported by a more convincing source stating that Giustiniani arrived in Constantinople with 700 men; a company&#x27;s worth. The corroboration between the two sources renders Caferro&#x27;s thoroughly convincing.

Continuing the trend of tangentially related scholarly releases is the 2009 &quot;The Employment of Large Groups of Mercenaries in Byzantium in the Period ca. 1290-1305 as Viewed by the Sources&quot; by Savvas Kyriakidis. The record covers the Byzantine habit of largely relying on mercenaries and introduces the logic as to why and some examples of how hiring mercenaries played out for the Byzantines. But the part relevant to Giustiniani is how the record mentions that one of the reasons mercenaries had become such a relied upon force is that the Byzantine leadership lacked trust in native military leaders due to a mixture of incompetence and the threat of rebellion. Which offers insight as to why a mercenary who only arrived recently to the defense may be selected to lead over native officers who would seem to have more of a stake in the cities defense. With the principles laid out in Kyriakidis’ work fitting rather well to Giustiniani&#x27;s promotion, their argument for Byzantine mercenary reliance becomes very compelling. For a long stretch of time, Giovanni Giustiniani was almost completely absent from the historical record in terms of direct references, with only records about mercenaries offering insight into what those direct references don&#x27;t say outright.

Though the streak of vocationally related publications would come to an end in 2011 with another direct reference to Giovanni Giustiniani and mark the beginning of more recent interpretations of his role in history. Marios Philippides and Walter Hanak&#x27;s &quot;The Siege and Fall of Constantinople in 1453 Historiography, Topography and Military studies&quot; is a book containing a staggeringly comprehensive look at the fall of Constantinople that draws on many original Greek sources. It also mentions Giustiniani quite a few times as it lays out evidence for questions otherwise left unanswered by previous records. Such as explanations of what he was doing before the siege, framing him as a potential corsair, or potentially invited there by the Emperor himself; though the author doesn&#x27;t seem particularly convinced by the evidence of an invitation. It also takes significant time to rebuff Barbaro&#x27;s claim that Giustiniani left without being injured, not only directly countering the claim but providing several pages of other sources which cite that he was injured though they differ in how they claim he was hurt. It is thoroughly compelling and well argued. Unfortunately, the fountain of information provided by this text doesn&#x27;t start a trend, as the next entry which mentions Giovani only passingly mentions him within the greater context of discussing the defense of Constantinople. While the newer interpretations do contest some claims of the previous sources, mostly all they do is expand upon previous information or contain roughly the same amount as previous; there is no real shift in debate.

<text>Kerrang! Radio is a British specialist digital rock music radio station related to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine. It is owned and operated by Bauer and forms part of the Kerrang! Network. 

As of June 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 417,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==Stations==
==History==
===Initial launch: 2002/2003===
Launched as a digital station on Freeview in 2002, expanded to London from 2003. It was also known as Kerrang! 105.2 FM in the West Midlands from 2004 to 2013 when its studios in Lionel Street, Birmingham, 105.2 was turned over to Planet Rock (which was then replaced by Absolute Radio from 2015) in June 2013. It was London only until May 2018 to make way for Hits Radio.

In July 2002, ahead of the Radio Authority&#x27;s advertisement for a new regional FM franchise for the West Midlands, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine launched an FM radio station in Birmingham on a short-term Restricted Service Licence at a frequency of 87.7 FM. The station was broadcast from the grounds of Birmingham City Football Club and was initially on air for one month only.

Kerrang! Radio as a permanent service first launched in late 2002 as a largely automated rock music service delivered over the Freeview platform, as one of a suite of stations its parent company (then Emap) added to the then-new Freeview TV system, the others including fellow digital jukebox stations Smash Hits Radio, Q Radio and Heat Radio, and relays of London stations Kiss 100 and Magic 105.4 FM. This new Kerrang! Radio was also streamed online, and served as a sibling to Kerrang! TV which launched around the same time: these stations being connected with the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; print magazine in name, ownership and style.

This digital &#x27;jukebox&#x27; version of Kerrang! was subsequently rolled out to DAB digital radio, beginning with transmission in London from 1 November 2003. The DAB service was extended to other areas from 2004, joining Emap-owned multiplexes in northern England (largely replacing The Hits Radio) and also made available on the regional multiplexes for the West Midlands and central Scotland.

===FM radio station: 2004–2013===
Kerrang! Radio first went on air in June 2004, following Kerrang!&#x27;s successful bid for the West Midlands regional FM franchise the previous October. The station was based at new dedicated studios located in Lionel Street, Birmingham, officially opened by Black Sabbath&#x27;s guitarist Tony Iommi. Broadcasting on the new 105.2 FM Midlands frequency, Kerrang! Radio replaced the prior digital Kerrang! Radio on DAB, TV platforms and online. The new station&#x27;s format mixed modern and classic rock with speech content targeted at a young adult rock audience. In the FM era the station ran a somewhat more mainstream, adult-rock tone of daytime output than the magazine, featuring more indie and alternative rock than the magazine, which traditionally focused on heavier rock genres. The night shows were conversely very much fuelled by the traditional Kerrang! Magazine sound, with a wider and less mainstream style, playing a mix of punk and metal bands.

In October 2007, as part of a major overhaul of Kerrang! Radio&#x27;s program schedule and line-up of hosts, former &quot;Big Brother UK&quot; contestant Kate Lawler was taken on as co-presenter of the &quot;Morning After&quot; breakfast show, alongside Tim Shaw. Another new appointment at this time was Nick Margerrison, who became one of the regular presenters of the &quot;Night Before&quot; late night show.

By 2009, the station had changed the style of music it played in order to appeal to a wider audience, and radio industry listening figures published in March of that year revealed that the station was broadcasting to 374,000 people across the West Midlands. Kerrang! Radio won a Gold Award in the Station of the Year category at the 2009 Sony Radio Academy Awards.

==== Rock Dog ====
March of 2013 saw Kerrang! partner with Guide Dogs charity to have a black Labrador canine, dubbed Rock Dog host a radio show on Sundays. The radio programmer at the time reported &quot;People seem to be having trouble believing us, but it really is a dog. Like, an actual dog. It&#x27;s a programme for people who love rock music. And dogs&quot;. Clips of the show are archived on the internet. Rock Dog continued through May of 2013, after which changes in the station eliminated the show.

===Return to digital-only platforms===
On 23 May 2013, Bauer Media announced that the output of older-skewing DAB rock station Planet Rock (which they had acquired three months earlier) would become available on FM in the West Midlands, taking over Kerrang! Radio&#x27;s 105.2 FM broadcast frequency. Kerrang! Radio transmitted its final FM broadcast just three weeks later, on 14 June, and the station&#x27;s studios in Birmingham city centre were permanently closed. A reduced Kerrang! service would continue, with some of the same DJs, as a young-focused rock service through the local DAB platform, digital TV and online, but all programming on both stations would come from Bauer&#x27;s London premises. The digital footprint of Kerrang! was largely unchanged, though this was not universal and omitted some areas of the UK. In August 2013, the closure of the regional MXR digital radio multiplex for the West Midlands saw Kerrang! among several stations rolled down to the Birmingham-area local multiplex, meaning that the station disappeared from DAB in some parts of the region.

On 12 December 2014, carriage of Kerrang! Radio on DAB outside London ceased, with the station turning over almost all its transmission areas to Absolute Radio 90s; this was in preparation for the removal of Absolute 90s from Digital One in favour of Magic 105.4 FM in January 2015. Kerrang! remained available in London by moving to the slot previously home to Absolute Radio 00s. Kerrang! continues to broadcast nationally via Freeview and online platforms as before. The reduction in Kerrang!&#x27;s DAB footprint saw the station become unavailable to radio listeners in Birmingham, in the former FM licence area.

Following the departure of breakfast presenter Kate Lawler to Virgin Radio UK in early 2016, a schedule reshuffle promoted Jake Thomson to breakfast, with his prior daytime show taken over by former host Alex James.

In July 2017, Sophie Kostrowski joined the station to host the weekday breakfast show, as the replacement for Jake Thomson who moved to the weekend breakfast show on classic-dance music station Kisstory.

In December 2017, the UK&#x27;s biggest club night Propaganda began broadcasting their own radio show on Kerrang! every Saturday night from 7pm to 10pm, presented by resident DJ Gabby Sanderson.

On 23 May 2018, the London DAB transmission of Kerrang! Radio ceased with the station removed, along with Absolute Radio 70s, to make way for Bauer&#x27;s new contemporary hit radio station Hits Radio. Kerrang! continues to broadcast nationally over Freeview and online and on the Dundee DAB area.

On 23 March 2021, Kerrang! returned to Stoke &amp; Stafford and Bradford &amp; Huddersfield DAB.

In September 2023, it was announced that Kerrang! Radio would be made available on Sound Digital as a DAB+ station from October, making it available nationally via over-the-air radio for the first time. This was followed in March 2024 by the announcement that Kerrang!, along with most other Bauer-owned stations, would be withdrawn from the Freeview TV service as of 2 April (Absolute Radio remaining on the platform until May), ending Kerrang! Radio&#x27;s transmission on television guides after a run of over 21 years.

==Subsidiary stations==

===Klassic Kerrang! Radio===
This online only station was launched in August 2019, and focuses on classic rock music from the last 20 years.

===Kerrang! Radio Unleashed===
This online only station was launched in August 2019, and focuses on heavy metal music.

===Kerrang! Radio Premium===
Kerrang! Radio was among the initial suite of Bauer stations to launch a premium paid subscription online audio platform in spring 2021; the previously free Kerrang! Radio Unleashed and Klassic Kerrang! Radio joined the paid-for lineup in 2022.

<doc id="974923" wikidata="Q4969441" url="?curid=974923" title="British Americans">
<text>British Americans usually refers to Americans whose ancestral origin originates wholly or partly in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and also the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, and Gibraltar). It is primarily a demographic or historical research category for people who have at least partial descent from peoples of Great Britain and the modern United Kingdom, i.e. English, Scottish, Welsh, Scotch-Irish, Orcadian, Manx, Cornish Americans and those from the Channel Islands and Gibraltar.

Based on 2020 American Community Survey estimates, 1,934,397 individuals identified as having British ancestry, while a further 25,213,619 identified as having English ancestry, 5,298,861 Scottish ancestry and 1,851,256 Welsh ancestry. The total of these groups, at 34,298,133, was 10.5% of the total population. A further 31,518,129 individuals identified as having Irish ancestry, but this is not differentiated between modern Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom during the greatest phase of Irish immigration. Figures for Manx and Cornish ancestries are not separately reported, although Manx was reported prior to 1990, numbering 9,220 on the 1980 census, and some estimates put Cornish ancestry as high as 2 million. This figure also does not include people reporting ancestries in countries with majority or plurality British ancestries, such as Canadian, South African, New Zealander (21,575) or Australian (105,152). There has been a significant drop overall, especially from the 1980 census where 49.59 million people reported English ancestry and larger numbers reported Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish ancestry also.

Demographers regard current figures as a &quot;serious under-count&quot;, as a large proportion of Americans of British descent have a tendency to simply identify as &#x27;American&#x27; since 1980 where over 13.3 million or 5.9% of the total U.S. population self-identified as &quot;American&quot; or &quot;United States&quot;, this was counted under &quot;not specified&quot;. This response is highly overrepresented in the Upland South, a region settled historically by the British. Those of mixed European ancestry may identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group. Of the top ten family names in the United States (2010), seven have English origins or having possible mixed British Isles heritage (such as Welsh, Scottish or Cornish), the other three being of Spanish origin.

Not to be confused are cases when the term is also used in an entirely different (although possibly overlapping) sense to refer to people who are dual citizens of both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Sense of heritage==

Americans of British heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply &quot;American&quot; due to the many historic, linguistic and cultural ties between Great Britain and the U.S. and their influence on the country&#x27;s population. A leading specialist, Charlotte Erickson, found them to be ethnically &quot;invisible&quot;. This may be due to the early establishment of British settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities.

==Number of British Americans==
Table below shows census results between 1980 (when data on ancestry was first collected) and the 2020 census. Response rates for the question on ancestry was 83.1% (1980) 90.4% (1990) and 80.1% (2000) for the total population of the United States.
===Composition of Colonial America===

According to estimates by Thomas L. Purvis (1984), published in the &quot;European ancestry of the United States&quot;, gives the ethnic composition of the American colonies from 1700 to 1755. British ancestry in 1755 was estimated to be 63%, comprising 52% English and Welsh, 7.0% Scots-Irish, and 4% Scottish.

===Studies on origins, 1790===

The ancestry of the 3,929,214 population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names in the very first United States official census and assigning them a country of origin.
There is debate over the accuracy between the studies with individual scholars and the Federal Government using different techniques and conclusion for the ethnic composition.
A study published in 1909 titled &quot;A Century of Population Growth&quot; by the Census Bureau estimated the British origin combined were around 90% of the white population.

Another source by Thomas L. Purvis in 1984 estimated that people of British ancestry made up about 62% of the total population or 74% of the white or European American population.
Some 81% of the total United States population was of European heritage.
Around 757,208 were of African descent with 697,624 being slaves.

====A Century of Population Growth (1909)====
Estimated British American population in the Continental United States as of the 1790 Census.

====American Council of Learned Societies (1929)====
The 1909 &quot;Century of Population Growth&quot; report came under intense scrutiny in the 1920s; its methodology was subject to criticism over fundamental flaws that cast doubt on the accuracy of its conclusions. The catalyst for controversy had been passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which imposed numerical quotas on each country of Europe limiting the number of immigrants to be admitted out of a finite total annual pool. The size of each national quota was determined by the National Origins Formula, in part computed by estimating the origins of the colonial stock population descended from White Americans enumerated in the 1790 Census. The undercount of other colonial stocks like German Americans and Irish Americans would thus have contemporary policy consequences. When CPG was produced in 1909, the concept of independent Ireland did not even exist. CPG made no attempt to further classify its estimated 1.9% Irish population to distinguish Celtic Irish Catholics of Gaelic Ireland, who in 1922 formed the independent Irish Free State, from the Scotch-Irish descendants of Ulster Scots and Anglo-Irish of the Plantation of Ulster, which became Northern Ireland and remained part of the United Kingdom. In 1927, proposed immigration quotas based on CPG figures were rejected by the President&#x27;s Committee chaired by the Secretaries of State, Commerce, and Labor, with the President reporting to Congress &quot;the statistical and historical information available raises grave doubts as to the whole value of these computations as the basis for the purposes intended.&quot;
Among the criticisms of &quot;A Century of Population Growth&quot;:
* CPG failed to account for Anglicization of names, assuming any surname that could be English was actually English
* CPG failed to consider first names even when obviously foreign, assuming anyone with a surname that could be English was actually English
* CPG failed to consider regional variation in ethnic settlement e.g. surname &quot;Root&quot; could be assumed English in Vermont (less than 1% German), but more commonly a variant of German &quot;Roth&quot; in states with large German American populations like populous Pennsylvania (home to more Germans than the entire population of Vermont)
* CPG started by classifying all names as Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, or other. All remaining names which could not be classed with one of the 6 other listed nationalities, nor identified by the Census clerk as too exotic to be English, were assumed to be English
* CPG classification was an unscientific process by Census clerks with no training in history, genealogy, or linguistics, nor were scholars in those fields consulted
* CPG estimates were produced by a linear process with no checks on potential errors nor opportunity for peer review or scholarly revision once an individual clerk had assigned a name to a nationality

Concluding that CPG &quot;had not been accepted by scholars as better than a first approximation of the truth&quot;, the Census Bureau commissioned a study to produce new scientific estimates of the colonial American population, in collaboration with the American Council of Learned Societies, in time to be adopted as basis for legal immigration quotas in 1929, and later published in the journal of the American Historical Association, reproduced in the table below. Note: as in the original CPG report, the &quot;English&quot; category encompassed England and Wales, grouping together all names classified as either &quot;Anglican&quot; (from England) or &quot;Cambrian&quot; (from Wales).

===1980===
The 1980 census was the first that asked people&#x27;s ancestry. The 1980 United States Census reported 61,327,867 individuals or 31.67% of the total U.S. population self-identified as having British descent.
In 1980, 16,418 Americans reported &quot;Northern Islander&quot;. No Scots-Irish (descendants of Ulster-Scots) ancestry was recorded, although over ten million people identified as Scottish.
This figure fell to over 5 million each in the following census when the Scotch-Irish were first counted.

===1990===
Over 90.4% of the United States population reported at least one ancestry, 9.6% (23,921,371) individuals as &quot;not stated&quot; with a total of 11.0% being &quot;not specified&quot;. Additional responses were Cornish (3,991), Northern Irish 4,009 and Manx 6,317.

===2000===
Most of the population who stated their ancestry as &quot;American&quot; (20,625,093 or 7.3%) are said to be of old colonial British ancestry.

==History==
===Overview===
The British diaspora consists of the scattering of British people and their descendants who emigrated from the United Kingdom. The diaspora is concentrated in countries that had mass migration such as the United States (as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and that are part of the English-speaking world. A 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 5.6 million British-born people lived outside of the United Kingdom.

After the Age of Discovery, the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the British Empire&#x27;s expansion during the latter half of the 18th century, throughout the 19th century and first quarter of the 20th century saw an &quot;extraordinary dispersion of the British people&quot;, with particular concentrations &quot;in Australasia and North America&quot;, and to some degree into Africa and South Asia.

The British Empire was &quot;built on waves of migration overseas by British people&quot;, who left the United Kingdom and &quot;reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents&quot;. As a result of the British colonization of the Americas, what became the United States was &quot;easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British&quot;.

Historically in the 1790 United States census estimate and presently in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand &quot;people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population&quot; contributing to these states becoming integral to the Anglosphere. There is also a significant population of people with British ancestry in South Africa and in [&gt;British Overseas Territories]].

===Colonial period===

An English presence in North America began with the Roanoke Colony and Colony of Virginia in the late-16th century during the reign of Tudor queen Elizabeth I, but the first successful English settlement was established in 1607, on the James River at Jamestown. By the 1610s, an estimated 1,300 English people had travelled to North America, the &quot;first of many millions from the British Isles&quot;. In 1620, the Pilgrims established the English imperial venture of Plymouth Colony, beginning &quot;a remarkable acceleration of permanent emigration from England&quot; with over 60% of trans-Atlantic English migrants settling in the New England Colonies. During the 17th century, an estimated 350,000 English, Welsh and Cornish migrants arrived in North America, which in the century after the Acts of Union 1707 was surpassed in rate and number by Scottish and Irish migrants.
The British policy of salutary neglect for its North American colonies intended to minimize trade restrictions as a way of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its British founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion with French support against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and subsequently constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain&#x27;s formal acknowledgment of the United States&#x27; sovereignty at the end of the American Revolutionary War.

In the original Thirteen Colonies, most laws contained strong elements found in the English common law system.

The vast majority of the Founding Fathers of the United States were of mixed British extraction. Most of them were of English descent, with smaller numbers of those of Scottish, Irish Protestant or Scots-Irish, and Welsh ancestry. A minority were of high social status and can be classified as White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP). Many of the prewar WASP elite were Loyalists who left the new nation, some moving north to the Canadian colonies which remained under British rule.
====Immigration after 1776====
Nevertheless, longstanding cultural and historical ties have, in more modern times, resulted in the Special Relationship, the exceptionally close political, diplomatic and military co-operation of United Kingdom – United States relations. Linda Colley, a professor of history at Princeton University and specialist in Britishness, suggested that because of their strong colonial influence on the United States, the British find Americans a &quot;mysterious and paradoxical people, physically distant but culturally close, engagingly similar yet irritatingly different&quot;.

For over two centuries (1789–2009) of early U.S. history, all Presidents with the exception of two (Van Buren and Kennedy) were descended from the varied colonial British stock, from the Pilgrims and Puritans to the Scotch-Irish and English who settled Appalachia, with more recent presidents such as Joe Biden and Donald Trump having partial British ancestry.

==Cultural contributions==
Much of American culture shows influences from nation states of British culture. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the English language, legal system and other cultural attributes. Historian David Hackett Fischer has posited that four major streams of immigration from the British Isles in the colonial era contributed to the formation of a new American culture, summarized as follows:

* East Anglia to New England – &quot;The Exodus of the English Puritans&quot; (Pilgrims and Puritans influenced the Northeastern United States&#x27; corporate and educational culture)
* The South of England to the lowland South – &quot;The Cavaliers and Indentured Servants&quot; (Gentry influenced the Southern United States&#x27; plantation culture)
*Northern England to the Delaware Valley – &quot;The Friends&#x27; Migration&quot; (Quakers influenced the Middle Atlantic and Midwestern United States&#x27; industrial culture)
* The Scottish Lowlands to the Backcountry – &quot;The Flight from North Britain&quot; (Scotch-Irish, of lowland Scottish and border English descent, influenced the Western United States&#x27; ranch culture and the Southern United States&#x27; common agrarian culture)

Fischer&#x27;s theory acknowledges the presence of other groups of immigrants during the colonial period, both from the British Isles (the Welsh and the Highland Scots) and not (Germans, Dutch, and French Huguenots), but believes that these did not culturally contribute as substantially to the United States as his main four.

===Historical influence===
Apple pie – New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially &quot;American&quot;, such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey. &quot;As American as apple pie&quot; is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American.

===Automakers===
Buick – David Dunbar Buick was a Scottish-born American, a Detroit-based inventor, best known for founding the Buick Motor Company.

===Motorcycle manufacturer===
Harley-Davidson – The Davidson brothers were of Scottish descent (William. A., Walter and Arthur Davidson) and William S. Harley of English descent. Along with Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company was the largest and most recognizable American motorcycle manufacturer.

===Sports===

Baseball – The earliest recorded game of base-ball for which the original source survives, involved the family of George II of Great Britain, played indoors in London in November 1748. The Prince is reported as playing &quot;Bass-Ball&quot; again in September 1749 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, against Lord Middlesex. The English lawyer William Bray wrote in his diary that he had played a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, also in Surrey. English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray&#x27;s diary was verified as authentic in September 2008. This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by British immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball. Today, rounders, which has been played in England since Tudor times, holds a similarity to baseball. Although, literary references to early forms of &quot;base-ball&quot; in the United Kingdom pre-date use of the term &quot;rounders&quot;.

In addition to baseball, American football is a sport that developed from soccer and Rugby, which are both sports that originated in the British Isles.

Bowling or ten-pin bowling derived from Nine-Pins (nine-pin bowling) brought over by early British settlers.

===Continental Colors, 1775–1777===

The Grand Union Flag is considered to be the first national flag of the United States. The design consisted of 13 stripes, red and white, representing the original Thirteen Colonies, the canton on the upper left-hand corner bearing the British Union Flag, the red cross of St. George of England with the white cross of St. Andrew of Scotland. The flag was first flown on December 2, 1775, by John Paul Jones (then a Continental Navy lieutenant) on the ship &quot;Alfred&quot; in Philadelphia).

<text>Nitpicking is a term, first attested in 1956, that describes the action of giving too much attention to unimportant detail. A person who nitpicks is termed as a nitpicker.

The terminology originates from the common act of manually removing nits (the eggs of lice, generally head lice) from another person&#x27;s hair.

As nitpicking inherently requires fastidious attention to detail, the term has become appropriated to describe the practice of meticulously searching for minor, even trivial errors in detail.

Nitpicking has been used to describe dishonest insurers and bullying employers, or even bullying family members.
