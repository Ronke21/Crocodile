<text>Lovedrive is the sixth studio album by the German rock band Scorpions, released in 1979. Considered by some critics to be the pinnacle of their career, &quot;Lovedrive&quot; was a major evolution of the band&#x27;s sound, exhibiting their &quot;classic style&quot; that would be later developed over their next few albums. &quot;Lovedrive&quot; cemented the &quot;Scorpions formula&quot; of hard rock songs combined with melodic ballads.

&quot;Lovedrive&quot; was the band’s first album to be released by Harvest Records in Europe and Mercury Records in the United States and Canada following the band&#x27;s departure from RCA. It proved to be a major commercial breakthrough, reaching No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, which none of their previous five albums had dented at all. The RIAA certified the record as Gold on 28 May 1986, and the album also proved a breakthrough in the United Kingdom where it was the first Scorpions album to chart and peaked at No. 36.

&quot;Lovedrive&quot; ranked No. 25 on IGN&#x27;s 2007 list of the Top 25 metal albums.

==Line-up changes==
This is the first album to feature Matthias Jabs on lead guitar, and thus the first record to feature the band&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; lineup. Jabs replaced Uli Jon Roth who went on to form his own band, Electric Sun.

Michael Schenker, younger brother of rhythm guitarist Rudolf, had just split from UFO. He recorded lead guitars on &quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Loving You Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Lovedrive&quot;. At the beginning of the Scorpions&#x27; German tour in February 1979, Michael rejoined the band and the group reluctantly parted ways with Matthias Jabs. However, in April 1979 while the band was touring in France, Michael quit, which led to Jabs&#x27; immediate return after intense negotiations.

==Artwork==
The original album cover depicted a well dressed man and woman seated in the back of a car, with the woman&#x27;s right breast exposed and connected to the man&#x27;s hand by stretched bubblegum. The back cover featured the same man and woman, but holding a photograph of the band, and with the woman&#x27;s left breast completely exposed without any gum. It was created by Storm Thorgerson of the design firm Hipgnosis. It caused some controversy in the US upon the album&#x27;s release, with later pressings of the album bearing a simple design of a blue scorpion on a black background. The original uncensored art was restored for the remaster series.

Recalling the cover photo with the woman and the car, Thorgerson remarked: &quot;Not exactly the most politically correct scene you&#x27;ve ever seen. I thought it was funny, but women read a different inflection into it now.&quot;

In a 2010 interview, singer Klaus Meine commented on the album cover, stating: &quot;We just did not know it would be a problem in America, it was just sex and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. It is odd that in America some of these covers were a problem, because in the &#x27;80s when we would tour here, we always had boobs flashed to us at the front of the stage. Nowhere else in the world, just here. We just did not think it would be a problem to put out a record like &quot;Lovedrive&quot; in America.&quot;

<text>The MLS SuperDraft is an annual college draft for teams of Major League Soccer in the United States and Canada. It takes place in January and is used by teams to select players who have graduated from college or otherwise been signed by the league. The SuperDraft was first instituted in 2000, as a combination of the MLS College Draft, in which players having graduated from college were selected, and the MLS Supplemental Draft, in which all other players were chosen. The draft is divided into three rounds in which each club has a selection, the order of which is determined by a combination of the teams&#x27; playoff and regular season positions, with the last placed team (or expansion teams) getting the first pick.

== History ==
From 1996 to 1999, all American players graduating college were entered into the MLS College Draft, and were eligible to be selected by all Major League Soccer teams. Players who had already graduated from college were entered into a separate MLS Supplemental Draft. The division between the two was eliminated in 2000, when they were combined into a single MLS SuperDraft. Originally created to ensure strict parity in the league, the draft was designed to allow weaker clubs to develop their rosters. The first SuperDraft was held in 2000, and since then has become the primary draft of the league. Recently, the draft has been considered to be secondary to youth academies.

The importance of the SuperDraft waned in the 2010s as MLS teams established their own youth academy systems and acquired young players from other leagues. The 2020 MLS SuperDraft was conducted exclusively by conference calls and online streaming for the first time.

== Eligible players ==
Only players from the American college sports system (e.g., the NCAA and the NAIA) are eligible to be drafted. Canadian U Sports men&#x27;s soccer players are not included, despite numerous proposals and discussions in 2010 and 2012 when U Sports was Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS). In previous SuperDrafts, a few players were drafted directly from clubs outside the U.S. or Canada.

== Rules of draft selection ==

The draft process for the SuperDraft closely resembles the NFL Draft. Below is the process for the 2023 MLS SuperDraft:

#Any expansion club automatically gets the first pick; should there be two expansion teams, a coin toss determines who picks first in the SuperDraft and who picks first in the expansion draft.
#Teams that did not make the playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record.
#Teams that made the MLS Cup Playoffs are then ordered by which round of the playoffs they are eliminated.
#The winners of the MLS Cup are given the last selection, and the losers the penultimate selection.
#Remaining ties are broken by the goal differential, goals scored, goals conceded, and then the flip of a coin.

<doc id="989284" wikidata="Q289438" url="?curid=989284" title="Agbani Darego">
<text>Chief Ibiagbanidokibubo Asenite &#x27;Agbani&#x27; Darego, MFR (born 22 December 1982) is a Nigerian model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss World 2001. She was the first black African to win Miss World.

==Early life==
Abonnema-native Darego was born in Lagos to a family as the sixth of eight children. At age two, her family relocated to Port Harcourt where she was raised in D-Line. Darego attended Bereton Montessori Nursery and Primary School, and at ten was sent to boarding school in a bid to shield her from her mother who battled breast cancer. Her mother, Inaewo, owned a rice trading business and a clothing boutique, but died two years after her daughter&#x27;s move to boarding school. Darego has spoken of how the loss prepared her for tough challenges in the future. As a teenager, Darego longed to be a model, and auditioned for the M-Net &quot;Face of Africa&quot; modelling competition despite her conservative father&#x27;s wishes, but was not chosen as a finalist. Darego attended Federal Government Girls&#x27; College, Abuloma. Upon completing her secondary education she attended University of Port Harcourt where she studied Computer Science and Mathematics.

==Pageantry==
In 2001, Darego was crowned Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria. Contrary to popular belief, Darego did not replace Valerie Peterside after the latter was dethroned; Peterside had competed in rival pageant Miss Nigeria. A few months later Darego was a contestant at Miss Universe, and became the first Nigerian to place among the top 10 semi-finalists, finishing seventh overall. She was the only top ten contestant to wear a modest maillot as opposed to a revealing bikini during the swimsuit competition.

In November that year, she became the first Indigenous African to claim the Miss World title (Past winners Penelope Coelen and Anneline Kriel, both of South Africa, are of European descent, and Antigone Costanda, who represented Egypt in 1954 is of Greek heritage). Darego&#x27;s victory was widely welcomed in her home country, and her one-year tenure included goodwill trips and scheduled appearances on behalf of the pageant, and an MFR.

==Modelling==
Prior to winning MBGN, Darego featured in print commercials for boutique chain &quot;Collectables&quot;. After Miss Universe she was invited by Naomi Campbell to participate in &quot;Frock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a charity fashion show in Barcelona, and soon negotiated a modelling deal with Trump Model Management in America. Shortly after her reign as Miss World she was represented by London and Paris branches of Next Model Management and landed a three-year contract with L&#x27;Oréal, becoming only the second Black model to accomplish this feat after Vanessa Williams, and was photographed by Annie Leibovitz, a big name in Americans portrait photograph sphere for &quot;Vogue&quot;. Other brands she has modelled for include Avon, Christian Dior, Sephora, Target, and Macy’s. Darego has also appeared in &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Trace&quot;, &quot;Stitch&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Essence&quot; magazines, working with numerous designers including Oscar de la Renta, Marc Bouwer, Tommy Hillfiger, Ralph Lauren, and Gianfranco Ferre.

In her homeland Darego has appeared in advertising campaigns for hair care brand Gentle Touch with model Oluchi, and served as the face of Arik Air. She has also graced the covers of &quot;Complete Fashion&quot;, &quot;Mania&quot;, &quot;ThisDay Style&quot;, &quot;Genevieve&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, and &quot;TW Magazine&quot;.

==Other work==

Darego has judged numerous pageant, fashion and modelling competitions including Miss World 2014, Miss England 2002,
 Mr. Scotland 2002, and Elite Model Look Nigeria 2012 and 2014. In 2010, she launched a style and fashion reality show &quot;Stylogenic&quot; on Nigerian television, and three years later announced her denim range, &quot;AD by Agbani Darego&quot;, which includes jeans, dresses, sunglasses and bags.

==Personal life==
In the aftermath of her win in 2001, Darego was awarded an honorary chieftaincy by the Council of Chiefs of Lagos. At the time of her investiture, she was one of the youngest chiefs in the country.

Due to her busy work schedule, Darego left the University of Port Harcourt, but after moving to New York where she was signed to Next Model Management, Ford Models, and Trump Models, she enrolled with New York University to study Psychology, graduating in May 2012.

In April 2017, Darego married her longtime partner Ishaya Danjuma, son of billionaire General Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma, in a ceremony held in Marrakesh. Together they have a son who was born in September 2018, and welcomed another child in December 2020.

<doc id="989287" wikidata="Q3086516" url="?curid=989287" title="Residue number system">
<text>A residue numeral system (RNS) is a numeral system representing integers by their values modulo several pairwise coprime integers called the moduli. This representation is allowed by the Chinese remainder theorem, which asserts that, if is the product of the moduli, there is, in an interval of length , exactly one integer having any given set of modular values. 
Using a residue numeral system for arithmetic operations is also called multi-modular arithmetic.

Multi-modular arithmetic is widely used for computation with large integers, typically in linear algebra, because it provides faster computation than with the usual numeral systems, even when the time for converting between numeral systems is taken into account. Other applications of multi-modular arithmetic include polynomial greatest common divisor, Gröbner basis computation and cryptography.

==Definition==

A residue numeral system is defined by a set of integers
:formula_1
called the &quot;moduli&quot;, which are generally supposed to be pairwise coprime (that is, any two of them have a greatest common divisor equal to one). Residue number systems have been defined for non-coprime moduli, but are not commonly used because of worse properties. Therefore, they will not be considered in the remainder of this article.

An integer is represented in the residue numeral system by the set of its remainders
:formula_2
under Euclidean division by the moduli. That is 
:formula_3
and
:formula_4
for every 

Let be the product of all the formula_5. Two integers whose difference is a multiple of have the same representation in the residue numeral system defined by the s. More precisely, the Chinese remainder theorem asserts that each of the different sets of possible residues represents exactly one residue class modulo . That is, each set of residues represents exactly one integer formula_6 in the interval formula_7. For signed numbers, the dynamic range is formula_8
(when formula_9 is even, generally an extra negative value is represented).

==Arithmetic operations==

For adding, subtracting and multiplying numbers represented in a residue number system, it suffices to perform the same modular operation on each pair of residues. More precisely, if 
:formula_10
is the list of moduli, the sum of the integers and , respectively represented by the residues formula_11 and formula_12 is the integer represented by formula_13 such that
:formula_14
for (as usual, mod denotes the modulo operation consisting of taking the remainder of the Euclidean division by the right operand). Subtraction and multiplication are defined similarly.

For a succession of operations, it is not necessary to apply the modulo operation at each step. It may be applied at the end of the computation, or, during the computation, for avoiding overflow of hardware operations.

However, operations such as magnitude comparison, sign computation, overflow detection, scaling, and division are difficult to perform in a residue number system.

===Comparison===

If two integers are equal, then all their residues are equal. Conversely, if all residues are equal, then the two integers are equal, or their differences is a multiple of . It follows that testing equality is easy.

At the opposite, testing inequalities () is difficult and, usually, requires to convert integers to the standard representation. As a consequence, this representation of numbers is not suitable for algorithms using inequality tests, such as Euclidean division and Euclidean algorithm.

===Division===

Division in residue numeral systems is problematic. On the other hand, if formula_15 is coprime with formula_9 (that is formula_17) then
:formula_18
can be easily calculated by
:formula_19
where formula_20 is multiplicative inverse of formula_15 modulo formula_9, and formula_23 is multiplicative inverse of formula_24 modulo formula_5.

==Applications==
RNS have applications in the field of digital computer arithmetic. By decomposing in this a large integer into a set of smaller integers, a large calculation can be performed as a series of smaller calculations that can be performed independently and in parallel.

<doc id="989292" wikidata="Q373197" url="?curid=989292" title="Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship">
<text>The &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ships of the United States Navy were the first amphibious assault ships designed and built as dedicated helicopter carriers, capable of operating up to 20 helicopters to carry up to 1,800 marines ashore. They were named for battles featuring the United States Marine Corps, starting with the Battle of Iwo Jima. The first ship of the class was commissioned in 1961, and the last was decommissioned in 2002. The hull classification of &quot;LPH&quot; stands for &quot;Landing Platform Helicopter&quot;.

==Operational History==

Ships of this class participated in several conflicts and peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations:
*Nuclear weapons test support, Johnston Atoll 1962
*Cuban Missile Crisis 1962
*Vietnam War 1963–1973
*Dominican Civil War 1965
*Gemini and Apollo spacecraft recovery 1966–1975
*Iran hostage crisis 1980
*Multinational Force in Lebanon, 1982–1983
*Operation Urgent Fury, Grenada, 1983
*Operation Earnest Will, Persian Gulf 1987–1988
*Operation Sharp Edge, Liberia, 1990
*Gulf War 1990–1991
*Operation Eastern Exit, Somalia, 1991
*Operation Restore Hope, Somalia, 1993
*Operation Continue Hope, Somalia, 1994
*Operation Deny Flight, Bosnia, 1994
*Operation Uphold Democracy, Haiti, 1994
*Operation Vigilant Warrior, Kuwait, 1994
*Operation Assured Response, Liberia, 1996

One ship of this class, , was used in a 1970-1974 Sea Control Ship experiment to test the concept of a smaller aircraft carrier using V/STOL aircraft.

Another ship, , was converted to a mine countermeasures ship which hosted mine sweeping helicopters.

The hull design of the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class also became the basis of the slightly larger of amphibious command ships.

==Ships In Class==
The seven ships of the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class were given non-sequential hull numbers, as, at the time of their construction, five existing aircraft carriers were being converted to serve in the Landing Platform Helicopter role - these five ships were renumbered, with the new ships slotted into a single sequence. The five existing ships were:



==Popular Culture==

One of the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class ships served as the fieldsite in Edwin Hutchins&#x27;s classic cognitive science study &quot;Cognition in the Wild&quot;. Although Hutchins does not mention the ship class by name, on p. 7 he characterizes it as a amphibious helicopter carrier.

<doc id="989296" wikidata="Q6942317" url="?curid=989296" title="Music of Vanuatu">
<text>The music of Vanuatu may refer to any kind of music played in the country of Vanuatu.

== Traditional music ==
Traditional music (known in Bislama as &quot;kastom singsing&quot; or &quot;kastom tanis&quot;) is still thriving in the rural areas of Vanuatu. Musical instruments consist mostly of idiophones: drums of various shape and size, slit gongs, as well as rattles, among others. In various regions, aerophones, such as conch shells, whistles or bamboo flutes, are (or used to be) played. Membranophones and chordophones were also found in some areas, but have fallen into disuse during colonial times.

The large slit gongs which symbolize Vanuatu belong to these traditional instruments; they were most often used as musical drums to accompany certain dances, but also sometimes – though seldom – as a ritual means of communication; although widespread throughout Vanuatu, they are used vertically only in central areas of the archipelago (mainly on Ambrym). So-called &quot;traditional music&quot; is actually a very general cover term encompassing a wide and complex variety of musical genres known by every local community – in a way very similar to the vague term &quot;classical music&quot; of Western societies.

== String bands ==
Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as &quot;string band&quot; music. It combines guitars, ukulele, and popular songs.

== Urban music ==
More recently the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s. The early part of that decade saw bands like Huarere and Tropic Tempo forge a distinctly ni-Vanuatu modern musical identity, and more bands have followed in their footsteps, including XX-Squad and Vanessa Quai. Popular genres of commercial music, which are currently being played in town, include African new wave, Reggae, zouk music and reggaeton. African Zouk, Reggae and Reggaeton, a variation of hip-hop rapped in Spanish, played alongside its own distinctive beat, is especially played in the local nightclubs of Vanuatu with, mostly, an audience of Westerners and tourists. Reggae is also becoming the Nations favorite and the local upcoming reggae stars are not limited to Naio Band, Stan and The Earthforce band, Tujah, Smol Fyah and Metoxide!

<text>Jam! was a Canadian website which covered entertainment news. It was part of the Canoe.com online portal, formerly owned and operated by Quebecor through its Sun Media division, and now owned by Postmedia Network.

Jam! was the only media outlet that published a comprehensive collection of the official Canadian record charts as compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems.

CKXT-TV, Sun Media&#x27;s television station in Toronto, aired a nightly entertainment magazine series, &quot;Inside Jam!&quot;. However, due to low ratings the program&#x27;s airtime was reduced substantially. Effective March 24, 2006, the show went from a daily program to a weekend-only show, before being removed from the schedule altogether. One of the hosts of the show, Chris Van Vliet, announced on the programme in February 2010 that he would be leaving the show to join the CBS affiliate in Cleveland as their entertainment reporter. His co-host Tara Slone re-located in August 2010 to Calgary to become co-host of Breakfast Television on CityTV Calgary.

<text>Acme is a computer virus which infects MS-DOS EXE files. Each time an infected file is executed, Acme may infect an EXE in the current directory by creating a hidden 247 byte long read-only COM file with the same base name. (In MS-DOS, if the file extension is not specified, and two files with the same base name exist, one with .COM and one with .EXE, the .COM file will always be executed instead of the .EXE file.) Acme is a variant of Clonewar, a spawning virus. Acme is also perhaps a descendant of the small single-step infector Zeno, which is not to be confused with the Zeno programming language.

<doc id="989307" wikidata="Q7208095" url="?curid=989307" title="Point Mugu">
<text>Point Mugu (, Chumash: &quot;Muwu&quot;) is a cape or promontory within Point Mugu State Park on the Pacific Coast in Ventura County, near the city of Port Hueneme and the city of Oxnard. The name is believed to be derived from the Chumash Indian term &quot;Muwu&quot;, meaning &quot;beach&quot;, which was first mentioned by Cabrillo in his journals in 1542. Mugu Lagoon is a salt marsh just upcoast from the promontory within the Naval Base Ventura County formerly called the Naval Air Station Point Mugu.

==History==
The name derives from Muwu (Ventureño: &quot;Beach&quot;), which was the name of a Chumash village at Point Mugu during pre-colonial times. The village of Muwu (CA-VEN-11) had the highest population of any coastal Chumash settlements along the Santa Monica Mountains. Muwu was a ceremonial center and the ancient capital of Lulapin, a major political unit of Chumash territory which stretched from modern day Los Angeles County to Santa Barbara in the north. The territory stretched for along the coast, and at least half as far inland. Mission records indicate that 191 inhabitants were baptized in Muwu, more than any other Chumash village by the Santa Monica Mountains. The last chief of Muwu, Mariano Wataitset, son of Halashu (Big Chief of Muwu), was baptized at Mission San Buenaventura in 1802.

On January 31, 2000, Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed off of point Mugu, killing all 88 people on board the McDonnell Douglas MD-83 operating the flight.

==Mugu Rock==

Mugu Rock is a distinctive feature of the coastal headland promontory that has been featured in many film shoots and television commercials. This igneous dike marks the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the Rancho Guadalasca boundary. The rock was formed when the roadway was cut through the near-vertical ridge of resistant volcanic rock in 1937. A route had been blasted out around the promontory in 1923–24 to complete Pacific Coast Highway between Malibu and the Oxnard Plain. This replaced a narrow path around the rock and much of that roadway has since eroded away.

The site is a popular but dangerous place for fishing, sightseeing, cliff diving, and rock climbing up the sheer sides of the rock. On Thanksgiving Day 2008, three young men from Oxnard were swept to sea and killed by a rogue wave while surf watching from Mugu Rock.

Directly east of Mugu Rock is Point Mugu State Beach Campsite. The park has of shoreline and more than of hiking trails.

<doc id="989311" wikidata="Q3312860" url="?curid=989311" title="Mighty Like a Rose">
<text>Mighty Like a Rose is the 13th studio album by the British rock singer and songwriter Elvis Costello, released in 1991 on compact disc as Warner Brothers 26575. The title is presumably a reference to the pop standard &quot;Mighty Lak&#x27; a Rose&quot;, and although that song does not appear on the album, the words of its first stanza are quoted in the booklet of the 2002 reissue. It peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart, and at No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== Content ==
The album was initially intended to be released under Costello&#x27;s birth name, Declan MacManus, as the singer had grown tired of the Elvis Costello pseudonym. Record label pressures, however, won the day and the release was as an Elvis Costello record.

&quot;Mighty Like a Rose&quot; continues in the vein of Costello&#x27;s previous album &quot;Spike&quot; from 1989, although with Mitchell Froom taking over the producer&#x27;s chair from T Bone Burnett. This time, the tracks were recorded in one location, Ocean Way in Hollywood, with orchestral and vocal overdubs taking place at Westside Studios in London. Two more songs from his collaboration with Paul McCartney appear, &quot;Playboy to a Man&quot; and a song selected as a single, &quot;So Like Candy&quot;.

Costello refers to this as an angry record, recorded in the aftermath of the Gulf War. The opening track, &quot;The Other Side of Summer&quot; was designed as a Beach Boys pastiche after their style in the early 1970s. The track &quot;Invasion Hit Parade&quot; features a trumpet solo by Costello&#x27;s father, Ross MacManus. The album also features &quot;Broken&quot;, a song written by his wife at the time, Cait O&#x27;Riordan, to whom the album is dedicated.

The lead single, &quot;The Other Side of Summer&quot;, peaked at No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart. Although it missed the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, it reached No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 40 on the Album Rock Tracks chart. The second single, &quot;So Like Candy&quot;, did not chart in either nation.

== Release history ==
The album was released initially on compact disc in 1991. As part of the Rhino Records reissue campaign for Costello&#x27;s back catalogue from Demon/Columbia and Warners, it was re-released in 2002 with 17 additional tracks on a bonus disc. Several of these were recorded at Costello&#x27;s home.

<text>Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC) is the former name of the current [[Naval Air Warfare Center]], Weapons Division. The name of the center was the Naval Air Missile Test Center prior to PMTC. It is located at Naval Base Ventura County/Naval Air Station Point Mugu in Ventura County, California. The nearest city to the installation is Oxnard.

The Naval Air Warfare Center consists of both the NAS Point Mugu airfield and a rocket launching site for the U.S. Navy. The center has been an active development and test facility for the Navy since the late 1940s. Among the missiles developed and tested there include the Sparrow family and the Phoenix, and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles and the Regulus surface-to-surface missile in addition to numerous prototypes of military rockets and sounding rockets.

== History ==

It was originally built for anti-aircraft training during World War II. The base later shifted from traditional anti-aircraft munitions training to become a test center for anti-aircraft missiles. Most of the missiles developed during the 1950s and 1960s were designed and tested at the base. This includes the Aim-7 Sparrow, Aim 54 Phoenix, Regulus Surface to the surface and the AGM-12 Bullpup.

== Facilities ==

=== Naval Air Station Point Mugu ===
This base is where most of the aircraft are launched for testing on the range. It is home to the test squadron and also other groups including the Air National Guard. This was also the airfield that US President Ronald Reagan flew into when he came to visit his ranch in Santa Barbara.

=== Naval Base Ventura County ===
NBVC supports approximately 80 tenant commands with a base population of more than 19,000 personnel. Tenant commands encompass an extremely diverse set of specialties that support both Fleet and Fighter, including three warfare centers: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Division and Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center. NBVC is also home to deployable units, including the Pacific Seabees and the West Coast E-2C Hawkeyes. Additionally, the base is home to the construction battalions that are used to create targets and facilities for the range. The Island of San Nicolas was transferred from the Naval Air Warfare Center to the base in 2004.
== Weapons tested ==

=== Air to ground ===
Walleye, SLAM-ER, standoff land-attack missile, laser-guided bombs, Joint Stand-Off Weapon, Hellfire, Maverick, low-collateral-damage bomb, AGM-84A, High-Speed Antiradiation Missile, general-purpose bombs, Advanced Anti Radiation Guided Missile

=== Air to air ===
Sidewinder, Sparrow, Phoenix, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile

=== High-energy weapons ===
The range is used to test and develop high energy weapons used to destroy Land and Air targets. The range is permitted to use up to 1 Megawatt weapons. The Range has tested and evaluated high energy weapons on both land and sea targets. They have tested high energy lasers to disable small boats. The laser was located on another ship.

=== Sea to air ===
Standard Missile, Rolling Airframe Missile, RGM-84A surface-launched, Evolved SeaSparrow Missile&quot;Titanic&quot;

=== Sea to ground ===
ICBMs, Tomahawk, Vertical Launch Asroc, Trident

== Aircraft used for testing ==
 EA-6B, EA-18G, E-2C, F/A-18, EP-3E, JSF, MH-60, UAS, F-14A, F-14B, A-3, A-4, A-6, A-7, F-4, F-8, OV-10, S-2

== Launch vehicles ==
Pogo Hi, Asp, Loki Dart, Coyote, Nike Cajun, Nike Asp, R-17, Polaris TV, Aerobee 100, Arcas, Loki, Nike Zeus, Kiva/Hopi, Sparoair II, Clean Sweep III, Tomahawk, Sparrow Arcas, Judi-Dart, Sparoair III, Rocketsonde, Terrier LEAP, SR19 1999 Sparo Air I

== VX-30 - Bloodhounds ==
VX-30 uses the aircraft to launch and track munitions for the range. VX-30 have used the F-4 Phantom (retired), F-14 (retired), F-18 (retired), S-3 Viking (retired), P3 Orion (active) and C-130s (active). This squadron is dedicated to this range and can be used for tracking and acquisition of targets also. VX-30 has conducted missions not only in the range but the Reagan Test Site in Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, to the waters off the Florida coast, supporting the Missile Defense Agency And the National Aeronautics And Space Administration. The squadron is also testing and evaluation for the US Navy.

== Targets ==

=== US Naval self defence ship. ===
This ship is owned by the US Navy and is the refurbished USS Paul F. Foster (DD-964). This ship is a remote controlled, fully functioning ship. Being unmanned it avoids safety constraints, meaning it can be a weapons test platform for live missiles. Testing features an anti-missile platform on the ship and towing a decoy. The missile will be aimed at the decoy and the ship will try and defend the decoy. Tested weapons include the MK 57 Sea Sparrow, Rolling Airframe Missile, AN/SLQ-32 ESM and the Phalanx CIWS.

=== Aerial targets ===
The range offers both Supersonic and Subsonic targets. This includes both BQM-74E, BQM-34S, AQM-37C, GQM-163A, QRQ-2B Flycatcher. These are used for anti-Aircraft testing and is launched from Naval Air Station Point Mugu and also from San Nicolas Island. These can be used to simulate enemy targets and are capable of emitting different radar cross section to simulate different aircraft. They also offer the QF-4 Phantom II for testing and evaluation of live and dummy missiles.

=== Sea targets ===
The range also offers smaller boats for testing and evaluation of weapons. These are all remote controlled so that live weapons can be used. The range offers the HSMST, QST, FACT, and MST. These are capable of testing weapons that are air launched and also ones from land.

=== San Nicolas Island ===
The island is used as live munitions testing range. It supplies a realistic marine environment, Remote and Fixed telemetry sites, 50,000 pound missile rail( located at 33.264278,-119.539), target launcher, Inert Missile impact area, 10,000 foot airfield for c-5 and c-17 and dedicated ordnance and range staff. This gives them the ability to launch and control a wide variety of missiles, aerial and surface targets from a controlled secluded island. It was also one of the 8 candidates for the first detonation of the atomic bomb before White Sands Proving ground was selected for it. During WW2 there were stationed aircraft on the island Including J4F Widgeon Amphibians and TBF Avengers. In 1946 the Island became strictly used as an auxiliary landing field for the island. The island is now used for mostly target acquisition and live training for the US navy. They have continued to upgrade the island with new telemetry radar facilities.

=== Electronic targets ===
The range is capable of simulated GPS, radar and Active Denial Systems for weapons-survivability testing. This is used for testing of anti-radar and anti-GPS targets.

==Amateur radio restrictions==
The US Code of Federal Regulations specifies that amateur radio operators within 322 kilometers of PMTC must not transmit with more than 50 watts of power on the 70-centimeter band.

<text>Vama Veche (historical names: &quot;Ilanlâk&quot;, &quot;Ilanlâc&quot;, ) is a village in Constanţa County, Romania, on the Black Sea coast, near the border with Bulgaria, at 28.57 E longitude, 43.75 N latitude. It is part of the commune of Limanu and in 2002, it had a population of 178.

==Geography==
Vama Veche administratively belongs to the commune Limanu. The town is located in Dobrogea, on the shore of the Black Sea, less than one kilometer from the border with Bulgaria.
==History==
It was founded in 1811 by a few Gagauz families, originally being named &quot;Ilanlîk&quot;. Its current name literally means &quot;Old border checkpoint&quot;, named so after Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) had been included in Romania in 1913. In 1940, however, that region was returned to Bulgaria, and the village has since lain once again near the border, but the name stuck.

Even in Communist Romania, Vama Veche had the reputation of a non-mainstream tourist destination, which has only grown since the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the communist era, concern for border patrol sight lines spared Vama Veche the development that occurred in other Romanian Black Sea resorts. It became a hangout for intellectuals; for reasons that are not exactly clear, the generally repressive regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu chose to tolerate this countercultural oasis, as long as people had their identity papers with them. Accommodations consisted of tents or rooms rented from peasants or fishermen. While camping is theoretically not permitted, to this day, many visitors or semi-permanent residents still stay in tents on the beach.

==Recent developments==
Famous for its nude beach, since the late 1990s Vama Veche has experienced development and gentrification, which has led to a &quot;Save Vama Veche&quot; campaign that is lobbying for the area&#x27;s environmental conservation and a halt to development and mass tourism. Nudism is still common on the beach today, especially on the Northern part where the beach ends and the area is less crowded. A major part of the &quot;Save Vama Veche&quot; campaign is the 2003 founding of the Stufstock music festival. Both &quot;Save Vama Veche&quot; campaign and Stufstock Festival were initiated by the &quot;Association for the Conservation of Bio-Cultural Protected Areas&quot; NGO. The August 2003 festival drew a crowd of about 10,000. The 2004 edition drew about 20,000 people. The 2005 Stufstock drew a record 40,000-large crowd, formed mainly by rockers, bohemians, punkers and goths.
In 2004, allegedly as a result of the campaign, legislation was enacted, limiting construction of new housing and roads or paving of existing roads. As of 2006, this seems to be enforced, with no visible new permanent structures being built within the preceding year.
Given the fact that it was considered an outlaw&#x27;s beach and a nice hippie place to spend your vacation, for many years it was considered an aquatic heaven
But now, because the toxic waste is out of control, people tend to throw even old fridges and medical waste in the water. What is more, the DDT, a toxic pesticide that was used more than 15 years ago, is still present in the water. 
Thirty years ago, dolphins and sea horses were the main symbol of Vama Veche, but now, due to pollution they all are part of the endangered species. Also, in the 80&#x27;s, there were 20 species of commercial used fish in that area of the Black Sea, while now, there still are 5-6.
In the annual report from the National Institute for Marine Development- Grigore Antipa, is stipulated that, as we speak, in Vama Veche are 220 species with different grades of endangerment, while 23% are extinct due to human and toxic waste.
Still, you can still go scuba diving if you want to see the last species standing.
In 2012 it is still ideal for backpackers, the village provides numerous accommodation options including free camping on the beach.

<text>A sewing needle, used for hand-sewing, is a long slender tool with a pointed tip at one end and a hole (or &quot;eye&quot;) to hold the sewing thread. The earliest needles were made of bone or wood; modern needles are manufactured from high carbon steel wire and are nickel- or 18K gold-plated for corrosion resistance. High-quality embroidery needles are plated with two-thirds platinum and one-third titanium alloy. Traditionally, needles have been kept in needle books or needlecases which have become objects of adornment. Sewing needles may also be kept in an étui, a small box that held needles and other items such as scissors, pencils and tweezers.

== Types of hand sewing needles ==
Hand-sewing needles come in a variety of types/classes designed according to their intended use. With each type also varying in size.
* Sharp needles: used for general hand sewing; built with a sharp point, a round eye, and are of medium length. Those with a double-eyes are able to carry two strands of thread while minimizing fabric friction.
* Appliqué: These are considered another all-purpose needle for sewing, appliqué, and patchwork.
* Embroidery: Also known as crewel needles; identical to sharps but have a longer eye to enable easier threading of multiple embroidery threads and thicker yarns.
* Betweens or quilting: These needles are shorter than sharps, with a small rounded eye, and are used for making fine stitches on heavy fabrics such as in tailoring, quilt making, and other detailed handwork; note that some manufacturers also distinguish between quilting needles and quilting &quot;between&quot; needles, the latter being slightly shorter and narrower than the former.
* Milliners: A class of needles generally longer than sharps, useful for basting and pleating, normally used in millinery work.
* Easy- or self-threading: Also called calyx-eyed sharps, side threading, and spiral eye, these needles have an open slot into which a thread may easily be guided rather than the usual closed eye design.
* Beading: These needles are very fine, with a narrow eye to enable them to fit through the center of beads and sequins along with a long shaft to thread and hold a number of beads at a time.
* Bodkin: Also called ballpoints, this is a long, thick needle with a ballpoint end and a large, elongated eye. They can be flat or round and are generally used for threading elastic, ribbon, or tape through casings and lace openings.
* Chenille: These are similar to tapestry needles but with large, long eyes and a very sharp point to penetrate closely woven fabrics. Useful for ribbon embroidery.
* Darning: Sometimes called finishing needles, these are designed with a blunt tip and large eye making them similar to tapestry needles but longer; yarn darners are the heaviest sub-variety.
* Doll: Not designed for hand sewing at all, these needles are made long and thin and are used for soft sculpturing on dolls, particularly facial details.
* Leather: Also known as glovers and wedge needles, these have a triangular point designed to pierce leather without tearing it; often used on leather-like materials such as vinyl and plastic.
* Sailmaker: Similar to leather needles, but the triangular point extends further up the shaft; designed for sewing thick canvas or heavy leather.
* Tapestry: The large eye on these needles lets them carry a heavier weight yarn than other needles, and their blunt tip—usually bent at a slight angle from the rest of the needle—allows them to pass through loosely woven fabric such as embroidery canvas or even-weave material without catching or tearing it; comes in a double-eyed version for use on a mounted frame and with two colors of thread.
* Tatting: These are built long with an even thickness for their entire length, including at the eye, to enable the thread to be pulled through the double stitches used in tatting.
* Upholstery: These needles are heavy, long needles that may be straight or curved and are used for sewing heavy fabrics, upholstery work, tufting, and tying quilts; the curved variety is practical for difficult situations on furniture where a straight needle will not work. Heavy duty 12&quot; (30 cm) long needles are used for repairing mattresses. Straight sizes: 3&quot;-12&quot; long, curved: 1.5&quot;-6&quot; long.

== Parts of the sewing needle ==

There are 6 parts to a sewing needle. The main section is called the shaft. The next part is called the shank. The shank is the part that is attached to a sewing machine or the part that is held to hand sew. Next is the groove. The groove is a dent that runs along the shaft. It allows for the thread to lie against the needle as it passes through the fabric. The eye is the next part of the needle. It is the hole near the tip of the needle that the thread is passed through. The scarf is the next portion of the sewing needle. It allows for the hook to form a stitch. The last part of a sewing needle is the point. The point is the tip of the needle that penetrates the fabric.

== Needle size ==

Needle size is denoted by one or more numbers on the manufacturer&#x27;s packet. The general convention for sizing of needles, like that of wire gauges, is that within any given class of needle the length and thickness of a needle &quot;increases&quot; as the size number &quot;decreases&quot;. For example, a size 9 needle will be thicker and longer than a size 12 needle. However, the needle sizes are not standardized and so a size 10 of one class may be (and in some cases actually is) either thinner or finer than a size 12 of another type. Where a packet contains a needle count followed by two size numbers such as &quot;20 Sharps 5/10&quot; the second set of numbers corresponds to the range of sizes of the needle within the packet, in this case typically ten sharps needles of size 5 and ten of size 10 (for a total of 20 needles). As another example, a packet labeled &quot;16 Milliners 3/9&quot; would contain 16 milliners needles ranging in sizes from 3 to 9.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric sewing needles ===
The first form of sewing was probably tying together animal skins using shards of bone as needles, with animal sinew or plant material as thread. The early limitation was the ability to produce a small enough hole in a needle matrix, such as a bone sliver, not to damage the material. Traces of this survive in the use of awls to make eyelet holes in fabric by separating rather than cutting the threads. A point that might be from a bone needle dates to 61,000 years ago and was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. A needle made from bird bone and attributed to archaic humans, the Denisovans, estimated to be around 50,000 years-old, and was found in Denisova Cave. A bone needle, dated to the Aurignacian age (47,000 to 41,000 years ago), was discovered in Potok Cave () in the Eastern Karawanks, Slovenia. Bone and ivory needles found in the Xiaogushan prehistoric site in Liaoning province date between 30,000 and 23,000 years old. Ivory needles were also found dated to 30,000 years ago at the Kostenki site in Russia. 8,600-year-old Neolithic needle bones were discovered at Ekşi Höyük, western Anatolia, in present-day Denizli Province. Flinders Petrie found copper sewing needles at Naqada, Egypt, ranging from 4400 BC to 3000 BC. Iron sewing needles were found at the Oppidum of Manching, dating to the third century BC.

=== Ancient sewing needles ===

A form of needle lace named nålebinding seems to generally predate knitting and crochet by thousands of years, partly because it can use far shorter rough-graded threads than knitting does.

Native Americans were known to use sewing needles from natural sources. One such source, the agave plant, provided both the needle and the &quot;thread.&quot; The agave leaf would be soaked for an extended period of time, leaving a pulp, long, stringy fibres, and a sharp tip connecting the ends of the fibres. The &quot;needle&quot; is essentially what was the tip end of the leaf. Once the fibres dried, the fibres and &quot;needle&quot; could then be used to sew items together.

Sewing needles are an application of wire-making technology, which started to appear in the second millennium B.C. Some fine examples of Bronze Age gold toques are made of very consistent gold wire, which is more malleable than bronze. However, copper and bronze needles do not need to be as long: the eye can be made by turning the wire back on itself and redrawing it through the die.

=== Later sewing needles ===
The next major break-through in needle-making was the arrival of high-quality steel-making technology from China in the tenth century, principally in Spain in the form of the Catalan furnace, which soon extended to produce reasonably high quality steel in significant volumes. This technology later extended to Germany and France, although not significantly in England. England began creating needles in 1639 at Redditch, creating the drawn-wire technique still in common use today. About 1655, needle manufacturers were sufficiently independent to establish a Guild of Needlemakers in London, although Redditch remained the principal place of manufacture. In Japan, Hari-Kuyo, the Festival of Broken Needles, dates back to the 1600s.

<doc id="989367" wikidata="Q5358685" url="?curid=989367" title="Elegiac">
<text>The adjective elegiac has two possible meanings. First, it can refer to something of, relating to, or involving, an elegy or something that expresses similar mournfulness or sorrow. Second, it can refer more specifically to poetry composed in the form of elegiac couplets.

An elegiac couplet consists of one line of poetry in dactylic hexameter followed by a line in dactylic pentameter. Because dactylic hexameter is used throughout epic poetry, and because the elegiac form was always considered &quot;lower style&quot; than epic, elegists, or poets who wrote elegies, frequently wrote with epic poetry in mind and positioned themselves in relation to epic.

==Classical poets==
The first examples of elegiac poetry in writing come from classical Greece. The form dates back nearly as early as epic, with such authors as Archilocus and Simonides of Ceos from early in the history of Greece. The first great elegiac poet of the Hellenistic period was Philitas of Cos: Augustan poets identified his name with great elegiac writing. One of the most influential elegiac writers was Philitas&#x27; rival Callimachus, who had an enormous impact on Roman poets, both elegists and non-elegists alike. He promulgated the idea that elegy, shorter and more compact than epic, could be even more beautiful and worthy of appreciation. Propertius linked him to his rival with the following well-known couplet:
The 1st-century-AD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas second only to Callimachus among the elegiac poets.

Another Greek elegiac poet, the subject of an elegy by Callimachus, was Heraclitus of Halicarnassus. Hermesianax was also an elegiac poet.

The foremost elegiac writers of the Roman era were Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid. Catullus, a generation earlier than the other three, influenced his younger counterparts greatly. They all, particularly Propertius, drew influence from Callimachus, and they also clearly read each other and responded to each other&#x27;s works. Notably, Catullus and Ovid wrote in non-elegiac meters as well, but Propertius and Tibullus did not.

==English poets==

The &quot;elegy&quot; was originally a classical form with few English examples. However, in 1751, Thomas Gray wrote &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;. That poem inspired numerous imitators, and soon both the revived Pindaric ode and &quot;elegy&quot; were commonplace. Gray used the term &quot;elegy&quot; for a poem of solitude and mourning, and not just for funereal (eulogy) verse. He also freed the elegy from the classical elegiac meter.

Afterward, Samuel Taylor Coleridge argued that the elegiac is the form &quot;most natural to the reflective mind&quot; and that it may be upon any subject, so long as it reflects on the poet himself. Coleridge was quite aware that his definition conflated the elegiac with the lyric, but he was emphasizing the &quot;recollected&quot; and &quot;reflective&quot; nature of the lyric he favored and referring to the sort of elegy that had been popularized by Gray. Also, Charlotte Smith used the term to describe her series of &quot;Elegiac Sonnets&quot;. Similarly, William Wordsworth had said that poetry should come from &quot;emotions &quot;recollected&quot; in tranquility&quot; (Preface to &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, emphasis added). After the Romantics, &quot;elegiac&quot; slowly returned to its narrower meaning of verse composed in memory of the dead.

In other examples of poetry such as Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, an elegiac tone can be used, where the author is praising someone in a sombre tone. J. R. R. Tolkien in his essay &quot;&quot; argues that &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a heroic elegy.

<text>The Aero A.34 &quot;Kos&quot; (Czech: &quot;Blackbird&quot;) was a small sports and touring biplane built in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s.

It was designed in 1929. The design was similar to the De Havilland Gipsy Moth. Of conventional biplane configuration and wooden construction, it featured wings that could be folded to allow it to be towed to and from airfields by automobile (width 2.91 m).

A prototype (registration L-BASO) had an 85 hp Walter Vega radial engine. It took part in the Challenge 1929 international contest (piloted by Josef Novak), but had to withdraw due to engine failure and crash-landing on August 8, 1929.

Seven A.34s and its variants were built by Aero, with different engines: three A.34Js had the Walter Junior engine, and three A.134s had the 100 hp Walter Venus. They were used as trainers and sports planes in Czechoslovak civilian and military aviation.

==Variants==
* A.34
* A.34J
* A.34W : Three aircraft powered by the 105 hp (78 kW) Walter Junior inline piston engine.
* A.134 : One prototype powered by the 130 hp (97 kW) Walter NZ 85 radial piston engine.

<doc id="989383" wikidata="Q936552" url="?curid=989383" title="Music of Tunisia">
<text>Tunisia is a North African country with a predominantly Arabic-speaking population. The country is best known for malouf, a kind of music imported from Andalusia after the Moors expulsion in the 15th century. Though in its modern form, malouf is likely very dissimilar to any music played more than four centuries ago, it does have its roots in Spain and Portugal, and is closely related to genres with a similar history throughout North Africa, including malouf&#x27;s Libyan cousin, Algerian gharnati and Moroccan &quot;ala&quot; or Andalusi. During the Ottoman era, malouf was influenced by Turkish music. However, Tunisian repertoires, styles and also instruments remain distinctive – the ʻūd tūnsī is an emblematic case. This is a close relative of the &#x27;uds associated with Algeria and also Morocco.

20th century musicians from Tunisia include Anouar Brahem, an oud player, Jasser Haj Youssef, a composer and a violin player, and El Azifet, a rare all-female orchestra, as well as well-known vocalist Raoul Journo, singer and oud player Dhafer Youssef, singer, guitarist and lutenist Nabil Khemir, Lotfi Bouchnak, Khemais Tarnane, Saliha, Saleh Mehdi, Ali Riahi, Hedi Jouini, Fethia Khairi, Cheikh El Afrit, Oulaya and Naâma.

In 1982, the pop-rock composer and singer F.R. David (born Elli Robert Fitoussi) peaked the worldwide charts with his song &quot;Words (don&#x27;t come easy)&quot;.

Popular singers include Nabiha Karaouli, Sonia Mbarek, Saber Rebaï, Soufia Sedik, Amina Fakhet, Nawal Ghachem, Latifa, Emel Mathlouthi and the late Thekra.

21st century alternative music groups include RedStar, JenJoon, Neshez, Zemeken, Aspirine, Kerkennah, Myrath, Ymyrgar and Checkpoint 303. (see Tunisian underground music)

Modern music festivals in Tunisia include Tabarka Jazz Festival, Testour&#x27;s Arab Andalusian Music Festival and the Sahara Festival in Douz.

==Malouf==

Malouf is played by small orchestras, consisting of violins, drums, sitars and flutes. Modern malouf has some elements of Berber music in the rhythms, but is seen as a successor to the cultural heights reached by Muslim Andalusia. Malouf has been called &quot;an emblem of (Tunisian) national identity&quot; . Nevertheless, malouf can not compete commercially with popular music, much of it Egyptian, and it has only survived because of the efforts of the Tunisian government and a number of private individuals. Malouf is still performed in public, especially at weddings and circumcision ceremonies, though recordings are relatively rare. The term &quot;malouf&quot; translates as &quot;familiar&quot; or &quot;customary&quot;.

Baron Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger is an important figure of modern Tunisian music. He collected the rules and history of malouf, which filled six volumes, and set up The Rachidia, an important conservatory which is still in use.

===Structure===

The lyrics of Malouf are based on the qasidah, a form of classical Arabic poetry, and comes in many forms, including the muwashshah, which abandons many of qasidah&#x27;s rules, , a very traditional form, and zajal, a modern genre with a unique format.

The most important structural element of malouf, however, is the Andalusi nuba, a two-part suite in a single maqam (an Arab mode organized by quarter-tones), which lasts about an hour. A nuba is a musical form introduced to North Africa with the migration of Muslim inhabitants of Spain in the 13 and 14th Century. It is divided to many parts :Isstifta7 Msader which are instrumental pieces Then come Attouq and the Silsla which introduce to the poems. The sung pieces begin with the Btaihia: A set of poem composed on the Main mode of the Nuba (there are several Modes in Tunisian music Ispahan Isbaaïn) on a heavily syncopated rhythm called BtaiHi. Then come al barawil, Al khfeiif Al Akhtam which close the nuba. The rhythms grow fast from a component to anthem of the Nuba. Each component of a Nouba has its specific rhythm which are the same in all the 13 Nouba known today.

According to legend, a distinct nuba once existed for every day, holiday and other event, though only thirteen remain. Partway through a nuba, an improvisational section was played in the maqam of the following day to ready the audience for the next performance.

===History===

The earliest roots of the Malouf can be traced to a court musician from Baghdad named Ziryab. He was expelled from the city in 830, and traveled west, stopping finally at Kairouan, the first Muslim city of great power in Africa. The city was a center for North African (&quot;Maghebian&quot;) culture and was the capital of the Aghlabite dynasty. Ziryab crossed the Maghreb and then entered Cordoba during a period of cultural innovation among the diverse inhabitants of the region. He became a court musician again and used influences from the local area, the Maghreb, and his native Middle East to form a distinctively Andalusian style.

Beginning in the 13th century, Muslims fleeing persecution by Christians in what is now Spain and Portugal settled in cities across North Africa, including Tunis, bringing with them their music. Tunisian Malouf, and its closely related cousin in Libya, were later influenced by Ottoman music. This process peaked in the middle of the 18th century, when the Bey of Tunisia, Muhammad al-Rashid, a musician, used Turkish-style instrumental compositions in his work and firmly set the structure of the Nuba. Though his system has evolved considerably, most of the instrumental sections of modern nubat are derived from al-Rashid.

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia became a French protectorate and the declining Malouf was revitalized. Baron Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger, a French-naturalized Bavarian living near Tunis, commission a collection of ancient works, working with Ali al-Darwish of Aleppo. Al-Darwish and d&#x27;Erlanger&#x27;s pioneering study of Tunisian music was presented at the International Congress of Arabic Music, held in 1932. Baron Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger died only a few months after the congress, which revolutionized Arab music across the world. In Tunisia, the meeting inspired The Rachidia, which was formed in 1934 to preserve the malouf. The Rachidia undertook some alterations, revising lyrics that were considered profane, and also constructed two performance spaces in the old city of Tunis. The Institute also helped to transition Malouf from being performed by folk ensembles with only a few instruments (including &#x27;ud, tar, darbuka, rabab and bendir) to symphonic pieces inspired by Western classical music and Egyptian ensembles.

The most influential such orchestra was called the Rashidiyya Orchestra, led by violinist Muhammad Triki. Rashidiyya Orchestra used a large chorus as well as contrabass, cello, violin, nay, qanun, and &#x27;ud sharqi, and followed the developing rules of Arab musical theory and notation. The thirteen surviving nubat were created during this time, distilled from the highly divergent folk forms still in use. Western musical notation was used; along with the popularization of recorded music, the use of improvisation quickly declined. These changes helped to popularize Malouf, though not without critics and gave the music a reputation as classical art music.

After Tunisian independence in 1957, the country&#x27;s first president, Habib Bourguiba, promoted the Malouf, recognizing its unifying potential. The then-director of the Rashidiyya Orchestra, Salah el-Mahdi, wrote the Tunisian national anthem, and eventually also became the leader of the music department of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. His musical theories became a major part of the Orchestra, as well as its successor, Institut Supérieur de Musique.

== Mezwed ==

Purely Tunisian music with pop Tunisian touch and Andalusi nubah cover. Most popular mezwed singers are Heddi Habbouba, Habib el Khal, Samir Loussif, Hedi Donia, Faouzi Ben Gamra, Zina Gasriniya, Fatma Bousseha, Nour Chiba. Mezwed, or mezoued, is both an instrument and genre of music. The instrument is like that of a bagpipe, although it is made with goat skin. The music mezwed is based around the instrument with singers and a darbouka beat. The more modernized version has more modern instruments with the Mezoued.

==Salhi==

Another authentic Tunisian genre, known as Salhi, can be heard on these tracks from 1931 , some of which are sung by Ibrahim Ben Hadj Ahmed, and others by another singer called Ben Sassi. The style may be related to Berber music, and is just as ancient and authentic as a facet of the (Tunisian) national identity.

== New genres in Tunisian music ==

==History==

===Soviet club (1944–1994)===
Following the re-occupation of Baltic states after the World War II, a team was created in Daugavpils in 1944 under the name of FK Daugava. During the Soviet period it was mostly known under name of Celtnieks or &quot;Stroitel&quot; (&quot;Строитель&quot; in Russian, &#x27;builder&#x27;) and for a while as Ķīmiķis (&quot;Химик&quot;, &#x27;chemist&#x27;) after its sponsor - the Daugavpils Synthetic Fibre Mill (). 

=== 1990s ===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the club became bankrupt and participated in competitions fielding its football academy, BJSS Daugavpils. In 1992-1994 the team briefly played as Auseklis Daugavpils before folding. A team under the name of Vilan-D was its successor throughout 1995.

In 1996, FC Dinaburg was founded as a successor to Auseklis and Vilan-D.

===Season 2006===

They qualified to play with Hibernian, of Scotland, in the second round of the 2006 Intertoto Cup after beating Havnar Bóltfelag, from the Faroe Islands, 2–1 on aggregate in the first round. They lost 8–0 on aggregate, losing 5–0 in Edinburgh and 3–0 in Daugavpils.

===Season 2007===
FC Dinaburg Daugavpils were eliminated from the Baltic League 2007 due to violation of Fair Play rules, but they once again qualified for the Intertoto Cup, where they started against Irish League team Cliftonville, but they lost 2–1 on aggregate, losing at home 1–0 after a 1–1 draw in Belfast.

===Season 2009===
They qualified to play JK Nõmme Kalju from Estonian Meistriliiga, Estonia, in the first round of the UEFA Europa League. They won 2–1 in Daugavpils, and drew 0–0 in Tallinn. In the second round they played Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.
In Israel they lost 4–0 and 1–0 in Daugavpils. Later that season, they were relegated from both leagues they participated in (Virsliga and The Baltic Football League) because of suspicions of match fixing and illegal betting.

FK Daugava Daugavpils took their place in Virsliga 2010, with all the players who had previously played for Dinaburg in their squad, except the ones who had joined new clubs during the transfer season.

<doc id="989390" wikidata="Q2525354" url="?curid=989390" title="Bob Marley and the Wailers">
<text>Bob Marley and the Wailers (previously known as the Wailers and prior to that the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers and the Teenagers) were a Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae band. The founding members, in 1963, were Bob Marley (Robert Nesta Marley), Peter Tosh (Winston Hubert McIntosh), and Bunny Wailer (Neville Livingston).

During 1970 and 1971, Wailer, Marley and Tosh worked with renowned reggae producers Leslie Kong and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.

Before signing to Island Records in 1972, the band released four albums. Two additional albums were produced before Tosh and Wailer departed from the band in 1974, citing dissatisfaction with their treatment by the label and ideological disagreements. Marley continued with a new lineup, which included the I-Threes, and went on to release seven more albums. Marley died from cancer in 1981, at which point the group disbanded.

The Wailers were a groundbreaking ska and reggae group, noted for songs such as &quot;Simmer Down&quot;, &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot;, &quot;Nice Time&quot;, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Stir It Up&quot; and &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
The band formed in 1963 following self-taught musician Peter Tosh (1944–1987) meeting the singers Bunny Wailer (1947–2021) and Bob Marley (1945–1981). They developed a ska vocal group called the Teenagers. The group soon changed their name to the Wailing Rudeboys and then to the Wailing Wailers before settling on the Wailers.

The band topped the Jamaican charts in 1964 with &quot;Simmer Down&quot;, which was recorded at Studio One with the rhythm section from the studio house band the Skatalites. &quot;Simmer Down&quot; was a message to the Jamaican rude boys to &quot;simmer down, oh cool your temper&quot; and became an overnight hit. The record played an essential role in changing the musical agenda in Jamaica from imitating foreign artists, to capturing the lives and spirit of Jamaica.

Wailer, Marley and Tosh recorded with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and his studio band the Upsetters. They also worked with renowned reggae producer Leslie Kong, who used his studio musicians, called Beverley&#x27;s All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Wright, Rad Bryan, Hux Brown) to record the songs that would be released as an album titled &quot;The Best of The Wailers&quot;.

By late 1963, singers Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith had joined the group. The line-up consisted of Braithwaite on vocals, Marley on guitar, Tosh on keyboard, Wailer on percussion, with Smith and or Kelso on backing vocals. Kelso remembered those early recordings fondly:

In 1965, Kelso left the band. Marley, Tosh, Wailer and Braithwaite took turns on lead vocals. Braithwaite left shortly after providing lead vocals for the single &quot;It Hurts to be Alone&quot;, leaving the band consisting of the trio of Wailer, Marley and Tosh. The band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;The Wailing Wailers&quot;, was released the same year, a compilation of tracks recorded at different times.

In 1966, they created a rocksteady record label Wail N Soul M. Constantine &quot;Dream&quot; Walker provided backing vocals from 1966 to 1967.

In May 1970, the band recorded with renowned reggae producer Leslie Kong; producing &quot;The Best of the Wailers&quot;, which they released later in 1971 as their fourth album. Over the rest of 1970 and 1971, the band worked with Lee &#x27;Scratch&#x27; Perry, producing the bands second and third albums, &quot;Soul Rebels&quot; (1970) and &quot;Soul Revolution Part II&quot; (1971). During this time, the Upsetters members Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett (bass) and his brother Carlton Barrett (drums) were recruited as instrumental backing for The Wailers.

=== Signing to Island Records ===
In 1972, while in London, the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers felt they were due royalties from these releases. Blackwell was not convinced, but he was impressed by their character. He thought they &quot;exuded power and self-possession&quot; despite being poor. Despite not having seen the band perform live, he advanced them £4,000 to record an album. He did not even require them to sign anything, feeling they deserved a break. Jimmy Cliff, Island&#x27;s top reggae star, had recently left the label. His departure may have primed Blackwell to find a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognized the elements needed to snare the rock audience: &quot;I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really be the way to break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in, he really was that image.&quot; The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J&#x27;s in Kingston, which resulted in the foundational tracks what would make up the album &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;. Primarily recorded on an eight-track, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; marked the first time a reggae band had access to a state-of-the-art studio and were accorded the same care as their rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll peers.

The tracks were taken to Island Studios in London and worked on by Blackwell, with Marley supervising. Blackwell desired the tracks to appeal to rock audiences in the United Kingdom and United States, to whom the band would be novel. To this end, he made the tracks sound &quot;more of a drifting, hypnotic-type feel than a reggae rhythm&quot;. He restructured Marley&#x27;s mixes and arrangements. The tracks were overdubbed with the help of Wayne Perkins on guitar and John “Rabbit” Bundrick on keyboard. The mix deviated from the bass-heavy sound of Jamaican music, and two tracks were omitted. The album released in April 1973, closely followed by &quot;Burnin in October 1973. &quot;Burnin contained the songs &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; (credited to Tosh and Marley) and Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;; a cover version of the latter was Eric Clapton&#x27;s first US #1 in 1974.

===Tosh and Livingston departure and I-Threes===
In 1974, Livingston left the band due to various disagreements with Blackwell, including not getting paid for the English leg of their Burnin&#x27; tour, and his refusal to play in the &quot;freak clubs&quot; that Island had booked the band. Tosh believed that producer Blackwell, whom he unfavorably called &quot;Chris Whiteworst&quot;, was responsible for the bad relationship between the band members. He thought Blackwell favored Marley over the rest of the band, giving him more attention and money, and with the decision to release their albums under the name &quot;Bob Marley and the Wailers&quot; instead of &quot;The Wailers&quot;.

Marley continued with a new line-up, which included the Aston Barrett (bass), Carlton Barrett (drums), Junior Marvin (lead guitar), Al Anderson (lead guitar), Tyrone Downie (keyboards), Earl &quot;Wya&quot; Lindo (keyboards), and Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson on percussion. Additionally, the I-Threes provided female backing vocals. The three I-Three members were Marley&#x27;s wife Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths. Their name is a spin on the Rastafarian &quot;I and I&quot; concept of the Godhead within each person.

The album &quot;Natty Dread&quot; was released in 1974, the first without Tosh and Livingston and with the I-Threes. It featured &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, a seminal song in the Wailers&#x27; canon, along with &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; and the more political &quot;Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)&quot;. In 1975 a live version of &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London during the &quot;Natty Dread&quot; tour, became Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers&#x27; first successful single outside reggae circles, reaching #22 on the UK singles chart.

Perry released two compilation albums for Trojan Records in 1974, &quot;Rasta Revolution&quot; and &quot;African Herbsman&quot;, which contained songs from &quot;Soul Rebels&quot; and &quot;Soul Revolution Part II&quot;, respectively, and he was the copyright holder of several songs from these albums. These changes caused a major dispute between Marley and Perry, when the former saw the albums, six months after their publication, in the Half Way Road in England.

Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers&#x27; next album, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;, was a breakthrough success in the US, reaching #8 on the Billboard 200 chart. The song &quot;War&quot; featured lyrics taken directly from the text of a Haile Selassie speech. The album credits numerous songwriters, including Bob and Rita Marley, the Barretts and Marley&#x27;s childhood mentor and friend Vincent Ford amongst others. Marley was in dispute with publishing company Cayman Music and sought to avoid contractual entanglements by putting the songs in the names of his family and friends, and provide them with potential future income.

Also in 1976, Bunny Wailer (Livingston) released his debut solo album &quot;Blackheart Man&quot;, with Marley and Tosh contributing backing vocals and the Barretts forming the rhythm section on some tracks. Peter Tosh also released his first solo album entitled &quot;Legalize It&quot;. Marley and Livingston received co-writing credits on some of the songs. Most of the then-current Wailers band (the Barretts, Anderson, Downie) played on the record, with Rita Marley providing backing vocals.

===Stay in London and &quot;Exodus&quot;===

Following an assassination attempt at their home in Kingston in December 1976, the Marleys moved to London, England in early 1977. Most of the current Wailers line-up followed, with Marley also recruiting Jamaican-born, London-raised guitarist Junior Marvin. This line-up recorded the next Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers album, &quot;Exodus&quot;, released in June, 1977. The album title (and title track) were conceived in response to Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley&#x27;s campaign slogan, &#x27;We Know Where We&#x27;re Going&#x27;. Featuring downbeat reggae rhythms fused with elements of soul, blues and English rock, &quot;Exodus&quot; was a top-20 hit in the US and UK while the song &quot;Exodus&quot; was #1 in Jamaica. &quot;Exodus&quot; also featured numerous songs which would go on to be hits and iconic Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers tunes in their own right, including &quot;Jamming&quot;, &quot;Waiting In Vain&quot;, a new version of 1965&#x27;s &quot;One Love/People Get Ready&quot; and the carefree, optimistic &quot;Three Little Birds&quot;. In 1999, Time magazine named &quot;Exodus&quot; the greatest album of the 20th century and the album has continued to feature in best-of-all-time lists.

In March 1978 the album &quot;Kaya&quot; was released. The record was coolly received by critics, who found it lightweight and uninspired following &quot;Exodus&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Kaya&quot; went top-5 in the UK and contained the hit single &quot;Is This Love&quot;. &quot;Kaya&quot; also contained new versions of three songs from 1971&#x27;s &quot;Soul Revolution II&quot;. Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers toured Europe extensively in support of &quot;Kaya&quot;, resulting in the live album &quot;Babylon by Bus&quot;, also released in 1978.

===Return to Jamaica and later years===

Marley and the Wailers returned to Jamaica in April 1978 to play the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston, aimed at calming political tensions and violence in their home country. Near the end of the concert Marley joined hands on stage with Manley and opposition leader Edward Seaga.

Bob Marley had a lifelong interest in Africa, having visited Ethiopia briefly in 1978. Themes of African independence and pan-African unity dominated 1979&#x27;s overtly political album &quot;Survival&quot;. Songs including &quot;Africa Unite&quot;, &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; and &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot; made Marley&#x27;s feelings plain, while the single &quot;One Drop&quot; employed a double-meaning of the reggae rhythm used in the song and a system of racial classification used in the USA. In 1980, Bob Marley (absent Wailers) was invited to perform &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; at the country&#x27;s Independence Day celebrations.

In 1977, following persistent pain in his right big toe, Bob Marley had been diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma, a rare form of skin cancer. Doctors recommended amputation of the toe, but Marley refused for religious reasons; he also feared it would hinder stage performance. Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers pressed on, planning extensive worldwide tours.

The last Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers&#x27; album released in Bob&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;Uprising&quot;, appeared in June, 1980. An assertive affirmation of Marley&#x27;s Rastafarian beliefs, the album contained the song &quot;Forever Loving Jah&quot;, the solo acoustic, folk-based &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, believed by some to be Marley&#x27;s finest song and the successful single &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot;.

The band embarked on a US tour to promote the album. One of the last performances that included Marley was in 1980 at Madison Square Garden. His final live show was performed at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh. By September 1980, Marley could no longer perform live. He sought alternative cancer treatments in Europe before attempting to return home to Jamaica. Marley&#x27;s condition worsened on the flight and he died in a Miami hospital on May 11, 1981.

===Post Bob Marley death===

A Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers album, &quot;Confrontation&quot;, was released in May 1983, two year&#x27;s after Bob Marley&#x27;s death. It contained unreleased and demo songs recorded during Marley&#x27;s lifetime. Backing vocals by the I-Threes were added to several of the songs to give the album some consistency. &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;, a single released from the album, was a top-10 hit in the UK. 

The music of Marley, Tosh and Wailer enjoyed considerable success as reggae music continued to gain popularity during the 1980s. In 1984 Island Records released a Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; album, entitled &quot;Legend&quot;. The album contains all ten of the Wailers&#x27; top-40 UK hits, plus &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and three songs from the Marley/Tosh/Livingston era, &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; and &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;. &quot;Legend&quot; went to #1 on the UK album charts and peaked at #5 in the USA, but it has stayed in the Billboard 200 and UK top 100 since release. It is officially the biggest-selling reggae album ever, with an estimated 28 million copies sold globally (as of 2024) 

Carlton Barrett and Tosh died —both of them murdered— in 1987. Braithwaite was murdered in 1999.

The Wailers Band was formed by Aston Barrett in 1989. The Original Wailers was instead formed by Anderson and Marvin in 2008, the same year in which Cherry Smith died.

The rest of the original members of the band died within a few years of each other: Earl Lindo died in 2017, and both Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson and Bunny Wailer (Livingston) died in 2021. Keyboardist Tyrone Downie died in 2022, and Aston Barrett died in February 2024. Donald Kinsey died in February 2024, on Bob Marley&#x27;s birthday, February 6, three days after the loss of Aston Barrett.

=== Legacy ===
In 2001, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; was reissued as a double album, with the first part being the previously unreleased &#x27;Jamaican&#x27; versions of the song without Blackwell&#x27;s overdubs and the second part being the album as it was released in 1972.

In March 2013, an overview of most of the music made by the Wailers prior to their signing to Island Records was published by the Roots Reggae Library.

The two species are: 



They are the two largest species of New World monkeys, and the northern species is one of the most endangered of all the world&#x27;s monkeys.

The muriqui lives primarily in coffee estates in southeastern Brazil. Males are the same size and weight as females.

<text>The Aero A.35 was a Czechoslovakian airliner of the 1920s and 1930s. Designed by Aero for long-range flight, with a transatlantic crossing in mind, it saw service with CSA although no such crossing was ever attempted. It first flew in 1929. A conventional high-wing monoplane, it was a very modern design for its day in all but one respect – the cockpit still had open sides. An extra passenger could also be accommodated here, beside the pilot.

==Operational history==

Two A.35s were sold to an industrial company, and were among the earliest aircraft purchased as corporate transports.

In June 1933, Czech Airlines flew the A.35 from the port town of Sušak (the former name for Rijeka). The aircraft was named the “Adriatic Express”.

==Operators==
*Czech Airlines
*Yugoslav Royal Air Force - One aircraft was impressed into military service in April 1940.

<doc id="989428" wikidata="Q1495651" url="?curid=989428" title="Lake George (New York)">
<text>Lake George, nicknamed the &quot;Queen of American Lakes&quot;, is a long, narrow oligotrophic lake located at the southeast base of the Adirondack Mountains, in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of New York. It lies within the upper region of the Great Appalachian Valley and drains all the way northward into Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River drainage basin. The lake is situated along the historical natural (Amerindian) path between the valleys of the Hudson and St. Lawrence Rivers, and so lies on the direct land route between Albany, New York, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The lake extends about on a north–south axis, is deep, and ranges from in width, presenting a significant barrier to east–west travel. Although the year-round population of the Lake George region is relatively small, the summertime population can swell to over 50,000 residents, many in the village of Lake George region at the southern end of the lake.

Lake George drains into Lake Champlain to its north through a short stream, the La Chute River, with many falls and rapids, dropping in its course—virtually all of which is within the lands of Ticonderoga, New York, and near the site of Fort Ticonderoga. Ultimately the waters flowing via the Richelieu River drain into the St. Lawrence River downstream and northeast of Montreal, and then into the North Atlantic Ocean Nova Scotia.

==Water quality==
Lake George is rated Class AA-Special by New York State and is considered drinking water. Despite being one of the top ten cleanest lakes in the United States in 2023 and 2024, Lake George is also on New York&#x27;s 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies.

==Geography==
Lake George is located in the southeastern Adirondack State Park and is part of the St. Lawrence watershed. Notable landforms include Anthony&#x27;s Nose, Deer&#x27;s Leap, Peggy&#x27;s Point (a jump into the lake) or (a jump), the Indian Kettles, and Roger&#x27;s Rock.

Some of the surrounding mountains include Black Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Pilot Knob, Prospect Mountain, Shelving Rock, Sleeping Beauty Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Tongue Mountain Range. Some of the lake&#x27;s more famous bays are Basin Bay, Kattskill Bay, Northwest Bay, Oneida Bay, and Silver Bay.

The lake is distinguished by &quot;The Narrows&quot;, an island-filled narrow section (approximately long) that is bordered on the west by the Tongue Mountain Range and the east by Black Mountain. In all, Lake George is home to over 170 islands, 148 of them state-owned. They range from the car-sized Skipper&#x27;s Jib to the larger Vicar&#x27;s and Long Islands. Camping permits are available for most islands.

The lake&#x27;s deepest point is , between Dome Island and Buck Mountain in the southern quarter of the lake. The northern end of the lake that is located near Ticonderoga is considered the southern end of the Champlain Valley, which includes Lake Champlain, as well as the cities Plattsburgh, New York, and Burlington, Vermont.

The Jefferson Project, a collaboration that began in 2014 between IBM, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the Fund for Lake George, is collecting data from the lake using depth sensors that can monitor currents, pH, salinity, and other data, leading the lake to be called, &quot;[t]he smartest lake in the world.&quot;

==Invasive species==
There are six known invasive species in Lake George. The Asian clam first found in 2010 is the biggest threat, along with the Eurasian watermilfoil. Other invasive species are the Chinese mystery snail, curly-leaf pondweed, spiny water flea, and zebra mussel.

==History==
The lake was originally named the &quot;Andia-ta-roc-te&quot; by local Native Americans. James Fenimore Cooper in his narrative &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; called it the &quot;Horican&quot;, after a tribe which may have lived there, because he felt the original name was too hard to pronounce.

The first European visitor to the area, Samuel de Champlain, noted the lake in his journal on July 3, 1609, but did not name it. In 1646, the French Canadian Jesuit missionary St. Isaac Jogues, the first European to view the lake, named it &quot;Lac du Saint-Sacrement&quot; (Lake of the Holy Sacrament), and its exit stream, La Chute (&quot;The Fall&quot;). The 1696 proposed war plan of John Nelson referred to the subject as &quot;Lake Mohawk&quot;.

On August 28, 1755, William Johnson led British colonial forces to occupy the area in the French and Indian War. He renamed the lake as Lake George for King George II. On September 8, 1755 the Battle of Lake George was fought between the forces of Britain and France resulting in a strategic victory for the British and their Iroquois allies. After the battle, Johnson ordered the construction of a military fortification at the southern end of the lake. The fort was named Fort William Henry after the King&#x27;s grandson Prince William Henry, a younger brother of the later King George III.

In September, the French responded by beginning construction of Fort Carillon, later called Fort Ticonderoga, on a point where &quot;La Chute&quot; enters Lake Champlain. These fortifications controlled the easy water route between Canada and colonial New York. A French army, and their native allies under general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm laid siege to Fort William Henry in 1757 and burned it down after the British surrender. During the British retreat to Fort Edward they were ambushed and massacred by natives allied to the French, in what would become known as The Massacre at Fort William Henry.

On March 13, 1758, an attempted attack on that fort by irregular forces led by Robert Rogers was one of the most daring raids of that war. The unorthodox (to Europeans) tactics of Rogers&#x27; Rangers are seen as inspiring the creation of similar forces in later conflicts—including the United States Army Rangers.

Lake George&#x27;s key position on the Montreal–New York water route made possession of the forts at either end—particularly Ticonderoga—strategically crucial during the American Revolution.

Later in the war, British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s decision to bypass the easy water route to the Hudson River that Lake George offered and, instead, attempt to reach the Hudson through the marshes and forests at the southern end of Lake Champlain, led to the British defeat at Saratoga.

Thomas Jefferson and James Madison traveled through Lake George during their Northern tour in 1791, sailing twenty five miles up to Lake Champlain. On May 31, 1791, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to his daughter, &quot;Lake George is without comparison, the most beautiful water I ever saw; formed by a contour of mountains into a basin... finely interspersed with islands, its water limpid as crystal, and the mountain sides covered with rich groves... down to the water-edge: here and there precipices of rock to checker the scene and save it from monotony.&quot;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lake George was a common spot sought out by well-known artists, including Martin Johnson Heade, John F. Kensett, E. Charlton Fortune, Frank Vincent DuMond and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe.

===&quot;Ethan Allen&quot; accident===

On October 2, 2005, at 2:55 p.m., the &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;, a glass-enclosed tourist boat carrying 47 passengers and operated by Shoreline Cruises, capsized during calm weather on the lake. According to reports from a local newspaper, 20 people (mostly senior citizens) died.

Initial reports indicated that the tour group was from Canada, but these reports were later found to be incorrect. It was later determined that the group was from the Trenton, Michigan, area on a week-long fall trip along the East Coast by bus and rail, organized by Trenton&#x27;s parks and recreation department and arranged through a Canadian company. Police said they had never seen a disaster of this magnitude on the lake. The captain survived and cooperated with police.

The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the incident revealed that, although the boat was rated to carry 50 people when it was manufactured in 1966, subsequent alterations to the boat&#x27;s design had greatly reduced its stability. At the time of the accident, the boat should have been rated to carry no more than 14 passengers. On February 5, 2007, the captain, Richard Paris, and the company that owned the boat, Shoreline Cruises, were indicted for having only one crew member aboard the boat. More serious charges were not filed because neither the captain nor the owners were aware they were violating safety standards.

==Character==
===Tourist destination===

Situated on the rail line halfway between New York City and Montreal, Lake George attracted the era&#x27;s rich and famous by the late 19th and early 20th century. Members of the Roosevelt, van Rensselaer, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Whitney families visited its shores. The Fort William Henry Hotel, in what is now Lake George Village, and The Sagamore in Bolton Landing 
opened at this time to serve tourists. The wealthiest visitors were more likely to stay with their peers at their private country estates.

The Silver Bay YMCA on Lake George was constructed in 1900. It has since evolved into a summer family camp, serving several hundred organizations and tourists every summer. Since 1913, on the East Shore of Lake George, YMCA Camp Chingachgook has hosted thousands of guests every summer.

Lake George is accessible by car via Interstate 87 and by air from Albany International Airport, which is about away.

Today, Lake George remains a tourism destination, resort center, and summer colony. Popular activities in the Lake George area include water sports, camping, amusement parks, hiking, paddling, and factory outlet shopping. Lake George is also toured through traditional steamboat rides on vessels such as &quot;Le Lac du Saint Sacrement&quot; and the &quot;Mohican,&quot; provided by the Lake George Steamboat Company. One of the nation&#x27;s oldest gatherings of hot air balloons occurs every September in nearby Queensbury.

Lake George is responsible for generating about $2 billion annually to the local region.

===Millionaires&#x27; Row===
Millionaires&#x27; Row is the nickname of a stretch of Bolton Road (now Lake Shore Drive) on the west side of the lake where millionaires built mansions or resided during the summer months. Such notables as Spencer Trask, Katrina Trask, Edward M. Shepard, George Foster Peabody, Harold Pitcairn, Russell Cornell Leffingwell, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Alfred Stieglitz, Marcella Sembrich, Charles Evans Hughes, Harry Kendall Thaw, Adolph Ochs, Louise Homer and Sidney Homer built or resided in palatial summer homes along Millionaires&#x27; Row. Although sometimes called &quot;cottages&quot; by their owners, these grand houses typically had dozens of bedrooms and more than of floor space.

Millionaire&#x27;s Row differed markedly from the more rustic summer &quot;camps&quot; built by other wealthy Adirondack summer residents such as William West Durant and John D. Rockefeller. Unlike the log and timber structures at the camps, the houses of Millionaire&#x27;s Row were built of stone and masonry in the Tudor Revival, Georgian Revival and Italianate styles.

Unlike their contemporaries in Newport and the Hamptons, which were built on tiny pieces of land, the cottages of Millionaires&#x27; Row were mansions in the true sense of the word. They were often built on hundreds of acres of pristine lakeside wilderness.

With the changing economic climate and the introduction of income tax, the mansions of Millionaires&#x27; Row became less sustainable by the 1930s. By the 1950s, with the advent of affordable auto and air travel, Lake George became more attractive to the growing middle class and less so to the &quot;jet set&quot;. Most of the mansions of Millionaires&#x27; Row were torn down or turned into hotels and restaurants. Among the surviving mansions are Evelley, Halcyon, Sun Castle (Erlowest), Oak Lawn, Wikiosco, Green Harbour, Homeland, Cramer Point, Depe Dene, Cannon Point, Hermstone, Mohican Point, Villa Marie Antoinette&#x27;s gatehouse, Three Brothers Island, Nirvana, and Wapanak.

<doc id="989439" wikidata="Q5434192" url="?curid=989439" title="Fantastic Five">
<text>Fantastic Five is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books which were published by Marvel Comics. The team exists in the MC2 Universe, an alternate future to the Marvel Universe. A continuation of the Fantastic Four, the team was initially composed of the Human Torch, his wife Ms. Fantastic/Lyja (a Skrull), the Thing, Big Brain (Reed Richards&#x27; remote-controlled robotic body), and Psi-Lord (Franklin Richards, Sue and Reed&#x27;s son).

==Fictional team biography==

The Fantastic Five first appeared in &quot;What If&quot; #105 (February 1998), an issue that focused on Spider-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Man. Spider-Girl became popular and was given her own series, along with the other characters in the MC2 universe (including the Fantastic Five). The Fantastic Five&#x27;s series lasted only five issues, but they remained recurring characters in the &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; title, which lasted for 100 issues in its first volume.

In the first series, &quot;Big Brain&quot; is a drone controlled from the Negative Zone, where Sue Storm is held in stasis, with her powers are holding back a breach in reality. When this problem is corrected, Reed and Sue return to Earth.

The team also appears in &quot;Last Hero Standing&quot; and &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot;.

In &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; and &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot;, additional children of the original Fantastic Four are shown as members of the Fantastic Five, including Super-Storm (Torus Storm, son of Lyja and Johnny Storm, who possesses the powers of both parents), Grim (Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Grimm, son of Ben Grimm, stuck in a rock-like form like his father), and Rad (Alyce Grimm, daughter of Ben Grimm, sister of Jacob, appears to have radiation-oriented powers, including flight). Doom, aka Kristoff Vernard, is also a member of the &quot;young&quot; Fantastic Five; he wears armor similar to Doctor Doom&#x27;s.

A new Fantastic Five mini-series was published in 2007, after the success of two mini-series events set in the MC2 line. In this series, the titular characters battle Dr. Doom.

==Roster==

===Active===
*Johnny Storm, the Human Torch - While Reed and Sue were in the Negative Zone, Johnny took command of the team. On their return, however, Johnny would clash with Reed over leadership techniques, even considering whether to form his own team.
*Ben Grimm, the Thing - Badly injured in a final battle with Terrax, Ben was outfitted with mechanical implants. Recently, his injured flesh has shown signs of regeneration.
*Lyja Storm, Ms. Fantastic - Johnny&#x27;s wife, a member of the shape-shifting Skrull race.
*Franklin Richards, Psi-Lord - Son of Reed and Sue, and master of telepathy and telekinesis. After absorbing a large amount of cosmic radiation, his head now has the appearance of a glowing skull, and he must wear a helmet to protect others from the excess energies.
*Jacob Grimm, Grim - The son of Ben Grimm and Sharon Ventura, he is similar in appearance to his father, and also possesses his strength levels. He joins the F5 in Reed&#x27;s absence.

===Former===
*Sue Storm, the Invisible Woman - Badly injured during a battle with Hyperstorm, she too was occupied in the Negative Zone until recently. She decides to remain in Latveria and care for her catatonic husband.
*Alyce Grimm, Rad - Jacob&#x27;s sister, she is able to control and project cosmic radiation. She decides to forgo the superhero life and returns home with her mother Sharon Ventura.
*Torus Storm, Super-Storm - Johnny and Lyja&#x27;s young son. Whilst he is not an actual member of the team, he insists on leaping into the fray whenever he can. He has his father&#x27;s fire powers and his mother&#x27;s shape-shifting abilities. In battle, he regularly takes the form of an older version of himself wearing an F5 uniform with a &quot;6&quot; on its chest.

==Other versions==
*&quot;What If..?&quot; #1 is set in an alternative universe where Spider-Man joins the Fantastic Four (rather than leaving when he learns there isn&#x27;t a salary, as happened in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1), and they become the Fantastic Five. This universe is revisited in &quot;What If..?&quot; #21, by which time Susan Storm has left the team and chosen to marry Namor of Atlantis.
*&quot;What If..?&quot; (vol. 2) #27 showed Namor joining the Fantastic Four, briefly making it the Fantastic Five until Reed Richards left to found Richards Technology.
*In &quot;Exiles&quot; #44, the Weapon X team—led by Hyperion—began their conquest of the actual world they were on, by killing its superhero teams. At the beginning of the issue, they began killing the members of the Fantastic Five, which consisted of Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the Thing, and Spider-Man as a fifth member.
*In &quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 1) #51, the Fantastic Five was the Earth-99476 counterpart of the Fantastic Four, consisting of dinosaur versions of the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man.
*&quot;The All New Fantastic Five?!?&quot; also appears in &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #87. Co-creator Tom DeFalco states that the new F5 were to appear in &quot;Fantastic Five&quot; #6 had the series continued.
*Fatal Five - Due to Seth&#x27;s return to action, Spider-Girl and American Dream travel to an alternate universe that was last seen in &quot;A-Next&quot; #11 to recruit Thunderstrike. During their trip, they encounter an evil version of the Fantastic Five consisting of:
**Reed Richards (he and that world&#x27;s Baron Zemo first appeared in &quot;A-Next&quot; #10-11 as assistants to Victor von Doom)
**Johnny Storm/Blow Torch
**Ben Grimm/The Brute
**Franklin Richards/Psi-Slayer
**Peter Parker/The Spider

<text>We The Curious (previously At-Bristol or &quot;@Bristol&quot;) is a science and arts centre and educational charity in Bristol, England. It features over 250 interactive exhibits over two floors, and members of the public and school groups can also engage with the Live Science Team over programming in the kitchen, studio and on live lab. We The Curious is also home of the United Kingdom&#x27;s first 3D planetarium. The centre describes its aim as being &quot;to create a culture of curiosity&quot;.

As part of its charitable status, We The Curious has an extensive community engagement programme. In regular weekends throughout the year We The Curious hosts &quot;Hello!&quot; weekends for communities who are currently under-represented in their visitors while also providing a community membership for charities and groups working in and for the community. Alongside this, We The Curious is working with local schools and community groups to plan exhibits and programming for the future.

The centre was closed for over two years following a fire and consequent water damage in 2022, but reopened on 2 July 2024.

== History ==

=== Background and origins ===
At-Bristol opened in 2000 as the successor to the &quot;Exploratory&quot;, a science museum and demonstration centre, founded by Richard Gregory in the former terminus train shed at Bristol Temple Meads railway station (later home to the British Empire &amp; Commonwealth Museum). The Exploratory was a separate organisation and none of the exhibits or staff were transferred when Bristol&#x27;s new museum opened in a city centre site as part of the regeneration of the historical Floating Harbour. The project was funded with £44.3 million from the National Lottery, Millennium Commission, South West of England Regional Development Agency, and a further £43.4 million from commercial partners (including a controversial donation from Nestlé) and Bristol City Council. The selection and design of exhibits were criticised by Gregory and other scientific adviser as being &quot;totally inappropriate to the spirit of science&quot;. Goéry Delacôte served as Chief Executive from 2005 until 2012.

The centre is situated on the former Canon&#x27;s Wharf. &quot;Wildwalk&quot; and the IMAX cinema occupied a modified 19th century former lead-works building, and &quot;Explore&quot; occupied a 1906 railway goods shed measuring . The goods shed was one of the first buildings to use reinforced concrete and both buildings are Grade II listed buildings. The buildings are located around Millennium Square – also part of the regeneration — and Pero&#x27;s Bridge, a footbridge across the harbour which links it to the Arnolfini art gallery, Bristol Industrial Museum and Queen Square.

At its opening the centre consisted of &quot;Explore&quot;, a more traditional style hands-on science centre, which contained features on mechanics, sound and light, computer science, space and the human brain; &quot;Wildwalk&quot;, a biodiversity centre showcasing life on earth through a mix of live animals and plants, multimedia footage and exhibits and hands-on activities, including an artificial rainforest, aquariums and other ecology-related exhibits; and an IMAX theatre.

=== Closure of Wildwalk and IMAX ===

&quot;Wildwalk&quot; and the IMAX Theatre closed in 2007. Despite At-Bristol&#x27;s insistence that the government should have supported Wildwalk, the science centres that were established by the Millennium Commission in 2000 were intended to be self-financing once established. This proved difficult for some of the 18 centres established in 2000, with The Earth Centre, Big Idea and Wildwalk all closing within 10 years.

Though the charity had no problems securing short term funds and grants when the centre was set up, enabling them to run the three attractions for just over six years, by 2005-06 most of these had decreased or ended. This left two options: close the whole centre, or close &quot;Wildwalk&quot; and IMAX, enabling funds to be channelled exclusively to &quot;Explore&quot;. As &quot;Explore&quot; was more popular with visitors, and &quot;Wildwalk&quot; and the IMAX theatre were more expensive to run, it was decided that the second option was viable. &quot;Wildwalk&quot; and the IMAX theatre closed for the last time on 31 March 2007, making 45 people redundant.

The Regional Development Agency worked with Bristol City Council to find new uses for the buildings, with the University of the West of England expressing an interest in using them for public outreach work with schools. In 2008, Blue Reef Aquarium took on the buildings for an aquarium and events space, which opened in October 2009.

===2010–2017===
&quot;Explore&quot; rebranded to At-Bristol in June 2010. Since opening in 2000, At-Bristol had had an annual operating deficit of around £1.5 million to be filled by fundraising.

=== Rebrand as We The Curious ===
In September 2017, At-Bristol reopened as We The Curious, with a new mission to &quot;create a culture of curiosity&quot;, in response to a consultation showing that the previous mission to &quot;make science accessible to all&quot; was no longer unique. Testing showed that the audience wanted the centre to be more challenging, to feature art as well as science and to be more inclusive. A new manifesto was produced in response to these themes, and the over 400 new names were considered before deciding on We The Curious. The name was tested with members, focus groups, volunteers and staff and it tested at 92% positive. We The Curious is currently working on Project What If, funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of the Inspiring Science fund along with 16 other generous funders. We The Curious is currently run by a team of over 140 part-time and full-time staff, led by Donna Speed as chief executive officer.

=== 2022 fire ===
On 9 April 2022 an electrical fire broke out of the building&#x27;s roof after birds damaged a solar panel.
The centre was evacuated and part of Anchor Road closed. Although the fire was extinguished within an hour, the water used for firefighting caused extensive damage to the upper floors of the building. After more than two years of repairs, the centre reopened on 2 July 2024.

== Current exhibits ==
The exhibitions are themed into various areas, some of which are permanent features, others change on a periodic basis. The ground floor of We The Curious is being re-fitted with brand new exhibits in 2020.

* The Planetarium – The UK&#x27;s first 3D planetarium with seasonal, presenter-led star shows for all ages.
* The Tinkering Space – Opened in July 2016. A space on the first floor to design, create and invent with a giant ball run, a Baxter (robot), Nao (robot), 3D printers and an air table.
* Food – A kitchen and living greenhouse with exhibits about the science of food and programming spaces to have a go at making your own. 
* Live Lab – An evolving lab space where visitors can experience current science including practical lab skills, research and dissections.
* All About Us – This opened in Spring 2011 and has 50 interactive exhibits which allow visitors to discover how amazing the human body is.
* Real Brain – As part of the All About Us exhibition, We The Curious has an exhibit that displays a real human brain. The exhibit has been produced to give visitors an understanding of medical science research.
* Animate It! – this exhibition was developed with Aardman Animations. Visitors can make their own animated films (2D and 3D), see a film set from Wallace &amp; Gromit&#x27;s &#x27;A Matter of Loaf and Death&#x27;, or make Morph spin in a Praxinoscope.
* Our World – Allows visitor to discover the world around us through investigation. Includes Icy Bodies, Giant Bubbles and the Turbulent Orb.
* Your Amazing Brain – The second large section on the ground floor, this area deals with the human brain, in particular optical illusions and memory.
* Studio TV (Then: Curiosity Zone) – Incorporating most of the upper level, this area deals with sound, light, force, magnets, and also includes a mock television studio.
* Space Gallery – This area includes exhibits about space travel and discovery, and the 3D Planetarium, in which 6-8 shows are given daily.
* Studio TV – a mock television studio.

We The Curious has its own exhibition workshop on site. Many of the interactive exhibits on the exhibition floor have been made by the workshop team in house, including the distinctive &#x27;Hamster wheel&#x27; of the &#x27;Wet Move-it&#x27; exhibition.

We The Curious is housed in a former railway goods shed, which was renovated to house the centre. The renovations included the addition of a large glass atrium to the North of the building, and stainless-steel sphere to the south, housing the planetarium. The architect behind the renovation was Chris Wilkinson.

The building includes a eutectic tank, which is a high transparent tube filled with thousands of balls containing eutectic salts. As the temperature within the building rises, the crystals within the balls melt, taking in the heat and cooling the building. As the building cools, the salts crystallise again, giving out heat. In this way, the tank helps keep the temperature within the centre constant.

== Former exhibits ==

* Wildwalk &quot;- &quot;Wildwalk was an Ecology Science centre, which contained two artificial rainforests, aquariums, hands-on exhibits, and live animal exhibits. The centre comprised a large building (previously a lead-works building) with a &#x27;living rainforest&#x27; attached to the southern side, and was designed by Michael Hopkins &amp; Partners. The centre housed animals, including butterflies, crabs, chameleons, frogs, finches, partridges, piranhas, seahorses, scorpions, snakes, spiders, tarantulas, triggerfish: in total over 150 species from all major animal groups. The botanical house was split into two distinct sections: Plants on Land, which traced the development of plants from simple mosses through to complex flowering plants; and Tropical Forests, which showcased plants from tropical continents, including a cycad which produced a rare, bright red cone tall and in circumference in 2003. Following Wildwalks closure, all animals and plants were re-homed to other zoos and natural history venues. Some elements of the exhibits from Wildwalk have been incorporated into Explore.


* IMAX – Housed in the same building as &quot;Wildwalk&quot;, the IMAX theatre was the first of the three At-Bristol attractions to open, on 20 April 2000. Since opening, the theatre received over 1.1 million visitors, and screened 70 films. The longest running film, and thus that with the highest attendance figures, was Cyberworld 3D.

== Charitable status ==
As an educational charity, We The Curious fundraises to fulfil their vision &#x27;to create a culture of curiosity&#x27;. This work includes specific inclusion projects, outreach work to groups who are unable to visit We The Curious, and bringing hard to reach groups to We The Curious. These groups include community groups, low-income schools and hospitals. Much of this work is made possible by the work of volunteers who have been part of We The Curious since 2006 We The Curious has also recently embarked on a career ladder scheme with partnership school City Academy.

== Venue hire ==
There are rooms and roof terraces above the exhibition space that are used for private hire. These have been used by organisations such as Sky News, the BBC and FameLab as well as other conferences, meetings and events. These spaces have also been used for weddings and civil partnerships. We The Curious also hires out the exhibition floor, Planetarium, Millennium Square and Anchor Square.

== Sustainability ==
Since its inception sustainability has been a key part of the We The Curious project. The We The Curious building (formerly Explore and At-Bristol) is an example of low-energy design with a phase-change storage tank enabling air source heat pumps to heat and cool the building using only night surplus electricity.

At-Bristol (as the centre was then known) joined the 10:10 project in 2010 in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. One year later they announced that they had reduced their carbon emissions (according to 10:10&#x27;s criteria) by 12%.

Since 2010 We The Curious has been on an intense sustainability drive to improve its performance in all areas of sustainability whilst also ensuring that the subject is included in its educational and promotional work. In 2011 At-Bristol was awarded a Gold Green Tourism Award and a West of England Carbon Champions Carbon Champion Award and in 2012 a Silver South West Sustainable Tourism Award.

March 2012 also saw At-Bristol&#x27;s environmental performance being improved further with the installation of a 50-kilowatt peak solar photovoltaic array to produce electricity for the building from the sun.

We The Curious now has &#x27;Strive for Sustainable futures&#x27; as one of the core pillars of its manifesto, and is constantly reviewing its environmental impact in order to try to become carbon neutral in line with the Bristol One City Plan. Part of this is to use the platforms available to educate the public about pressing environmental concerns, such as supporting sustainable palm oil and reducing air pollution.

<doc id="989459" wikidata="Q4306577" url="?curid=989459" title="Music of Eswatini">
<text>The music of [[Eswatini]] is composed of both ethnic Swazi music and varieties of folk music as well as modern genres such as rock, pop and hip hop, which has been popular in Eswatini since headed by bands such as Vamoose. The popularity of hip hop in South Africa, which shares a border with Eswatini, has also helped popularize it. Today the music industry of Eswatini is growing, with more young and vibrant musicians emerging in the scene proving to be worthy of the crown. 

The country consists of two major music festivals with the latter being traditional ceremonies where music is sung but is not the purpose of the events. Eswatini has been known to host the annual MTN Bush-Fire Festival which is held in May uniting artists and music lovers from around the globe. Another prominent event is the Standard Bank Luju Food &amp; Lifestyle Festival which is a feast of music, fashion, culinary exploits, and connoisseur led premium wine &amp; whiskey showcases. Traditional festivals in the country include Incwala and Umhlanga. The former takes place in December while the latter takes place in August. Umhlanga is known for its dance, performed exclusively by women, and its 5-day ceremony, which involves reed-cutting. Traditional instruments used include: the kudu horn, calabash, rattles, makeyana and reed flute.

With Eswatini being a small country, there&#x27;s only a handful of artists who have made a name worth remembering in the music scene. One of the top challenges Eswatini musicians face is the lack of a system that creates a functioning music industry i.e. a royalty collecting system. Thus, most artists are faced with the dilemma of having to register with foreign music royalty collecting organizations as means to make a little something off their work of artistry. In most cases, artists in the country see less to no returns from such moves. With more talent emerging and proving to be worthy of the crown we are hoping to see a positive change in such a small but rich industry.

<doc id="989460" wikidata="Q2905025" url="?curid=989460" title="Sam Katz">
<text>Samuel Michael Katz (born August 20, 1951) is a Canadian businessman and former politician who was the 42nd mayor of Winnipeg, Manitoba from 2004 to 2014. He is the owner of the Winnipeg Goldeyes and a member of the Order of Manitoba. He was owner of the Winnipeg Thunder and served as president of the short-lived National Basketball League.

== Life before mayorship ==
Katz was born in Rehovot, Israel. He emigrated to Winnipeg in November 1951 as an infant with his parents, Chaim and Zena Katz, and his older brother, David, and was raised in North Winnipeg. Shortly after graduating in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of Manitoba, he opened a retail clothing store in Brandon, Manitoba. Throughout his career he continued his entrepreneurial ventures in real estate and entertainment. His entertainment company, Showtime Productions Inc., brought artists such as Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones, and Paul McCartney, and musicals such as &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; to Winnipeg.

In 1994, he brought professional baseball back to Winnipeg with the Winnipeg Goldeyes, who now play in the American Association. Through this franchise, he arranged for the construction and success of Shaw Park in 1999. Katz was also founder of the Winnipeg Goldeyes Field of Dreams Foundation, an organization that has donated more than a $900,000 to children&#x27;s charities and non-profit organizations in Manitoba.

== Mayor of Winnipeg (2004-2014) ==
On June 22, 2004, Katz was elected mayor of Winnipeg, beating Dan Vandal, Al Golden, and MaryAnn Mihychuk and receiving 42% of the vote. This came after Glen Murray&#x27;s resignation as mayor to run in the 2004 federal election.

Katz was reelected in the 2006 elections with 61.60% of the vote. He was elected to a third term in the 2010 elections with 55% of the vote.

=== Mayoral decisions ===

====Aboriginal Community====
Katz assumed the role of Secretary of Urban Aboriginal Affairs in 2008.
In 2009, Manitoba Métis Federation (MMF) President David Chartrand and Sam Katz launched “It’s My Community Too”. Katz pledged $3 million for aboriginal youth over three years beginning in 2009.

====Advisory boards====
Katz created the Mayor&#x27;s Seniors Advisory Committee in 2007.

Katz also created the citizen-led Police Advisory Board.
Councillors Jenny Gerbasi, Mike Pagtakhan, Harvey Smith, Lillian Thomas and Dan Vandal voted in opposition to this board because it meets behind closed doors. In 2009, Katz hosted &quot;Mayor’s Symposium – A Sustainable Winnipeg&quot;. This symposium was a surprise to some residents because Katz has been critiqued for his approach to the environment and sustainability.

====Economy====
In 2005, Katz cut the business tax by 20%. Katz created a Special Events Marketing Fund for conferences and special events.

====Efficiency at City Hall====
First, the Mayor&#x27;s Red Tape Commission recommended 30 recommendations to cut red tape. One of the recommendations of the commission was to implement &quot;311&quot;. It was operational by January 2009. Expenditures have been posted on Winnipeg.ca since 2007. In 2009, Katz unveiled &quot;Plan Winnipeg&quot;, a 25-year blueprint for the future.

====Environment====
In 2008, Katz committed to a 20% reduction in corporate municipal greenhouse gases. In April 2009 a &quot;Mayor’s Symposium – A Sustainable Winnipeg&quot; was held and kicked off www.speakupwinnipeg.com, a collaborative approach to city planning that is socially, environmentally and financially sustainable.

====Infrastructure====
The Province of Manitoba and The City of Winnipeg negotiated a new infrastructure agreement with the Federal Government and the Provincial Government that included an increase of $50 million over two years (2006–08). Katz endorses the use of P3s (Public, Private Partnership) to fund roads, bridges and paths. This method is reported to have ensured the Charleswood Bridge project (completed in 1995 during Mayor Susan Thompson&#x27;s term) was built on time and on budget. (Katz had nothing to do with the Charleswood Bridge project, which long preceded his involvement in City Hall.)

====Property taxes====
In 2009, Katz pledged to keep property taxes in Winnipeg frozen for the 12th straight year. The policy was applauded by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, but has been criticized by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which, in their 2010 Alternative Budget, said &quot;the semblance of a property tax freeze is only made possible with less transparent tax increases to pick up the slack of fiscal irresponsibility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;20/20: A Clear Vision for Winnipeg
2010 - Alternative Municipal Budget&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recreation====
Katz supported an indoor soccer facility in The City of Winnipeg. Although controversial, he also championed having a waterpark in Winnipeg.

====Safety====
Katz welcomed a bylaw enacted in 2005 to restrict aggressive panhandling. He also committed to alternative options for at-risk youth including participation in sports and activities in community centres as a preventative measure. In 2007, Katz appointed Winnipeg Chief of Police Keith McCaskill. Katz increased the Winnipeg Police Department budget from $140 million to $160 million, which is 20% of the Operating Budget. Operation Clean Sweep became a permanent entity, which is supported by the established permanent Street Crime Unit. After touring New York City, Katz was interested in the creation and implementation of Crimestat, an interactive system to provide up-to-date information to help protect citizens. Katz supported a graffiti control bylaw to stop the sale and possession of spray paint to minors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce Annual Report 2007/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Katz supported a Winnipeg auto theft suppression strategy as a way to crack down on auto theft.

====Transportation====
Construction of the Southwest Rapid Transit Corridor started in summer 2009. A transit strike was averted in 2008. Katz has said that Winnipeg should take full advantage of being the mid-continent trade corridor.

=== Criticism ===
Katz was the subject of criticism after a P3 deal was tabled and provisionally accepted a 30-year deal with Veolia to manage Winnipeg&#x27;s waste water.

After referring to Winnipeg&#x27;s five female Olympic medal winners as &quot;beautiful females&quot; whose close-up presence made him &quot;feel like Hugh Hefner&quot;, Katz was criticized by a women&#x27;s studies professor at the University of Manitoba. Reaction from the citizens of Winnipeg was mixed.

Katz is the target of humour in a song by The Consumer Goods. Their song &quot;And the Final Words are Yours, Sam Katz&quot; was entered in medium rotation at a number of local radio stations and offers Katz ironic sympathy for the difficulties of running &quot;a city, a business and a baseball team&quot;, the use of Malathion for mosquito fogging, and a military training exercise (Operation Charging Bison).

Katz also came under fire from the city&#x27;s French-speaking population after removing a bilingual requirement from the criteria for awarding a restaurant license on the &quot;Esplanade Riel&quot; bridge and backing away from earlier promises to help fund a French-language theatre.

Six days before the Winnipeg City Council voted on the city&#x27;s operating budget, Katz revised it. This drew criticism from councillor Jenny Gerbasi and the Manitoba director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Adrienne Batra.

====Riverside Park Management====

Riverside Park Management is a nonprofit organization founded by Katz in 1997 to create a leasehold stake in the proposed CanWest Park stadium that eventually housed his Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball team. Katz continued his involvement after being elected mayor and when a property tax controversy arose was accused of conflict of interest as he was both Mayor of Winnipeg and president of Riverside Park from August 2005 to April 2008, while the two sides were engaged in a financial dispute.

====Fire hall construction controversy====
A 2013 city-commissioned report on the construction of new fire halls alleged that Shindico, a Winnipeg-based commercial real-estate developer, received the contract due to favouritism. According to CBC News, the developer was granted building rights after previous correspondence between Shindico and the former fire chief, Reid Douglas, despite being the highest bidder. Katz in particular was criticized due to his long-standing relationship with Shindico, of which he had partial financial ownership until 2013. Katz said his financial ties to Shindico had been severed, and denied any allegations of favouritism or involvement in the fire hall contract.

Immediately after the report was published, multiple city councillors asked for Katz&#x27;s resignation due to the fire hall situation. Katz&#x27;s friendship with Phil Sheegl, the former City of Winnipeg Chief Administrative Officer who negotiated the fire hall contract, received substantial attention. Katz stated that the councillors were entitled to their opinions but that he would not resign.

====Uniter opinion piece and lawsuit====
Shortly after the fire hall report was released, an opinion piece written by a volunteer was published by the Uniter, the University of Winnipeg&#x27;s main student newspaper. The piece, which criticized the mayor&#x27;s handling of the fire hall, resulted in Katz&#x27;s suing the university, the Uniter and the author of the piece. Katz said he was seeking an apology, as he knew that the Uniter did not have the funds necessary for a financial settlement. The university stated that it believed its involvement in the lawsuit was an error, given that it had no editorial oversight of the student paper. As of February 6, 2014, the case had not been heard in court.

== Honours ==
In 2002, Katz was presented with the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal. In 2003, he received the University of Manitoba Distinguished Alumnus Award. In 2004, he was given the province&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of Manitoba, for demonstrating an ability to improve the social, cultural and economic well being of Manitoba and its residents.

== Personal life ==
Sam was married to Baillie, with whom he&#x27;s had two daughters (born in 2001 and 2005). Katz began divorce proceedings with his wife on October 26, 2006 – one day after his reelection. Katz is married to Leah Pasuta.

<text>The Aero A.38 was a Czechoslovakian biplane airliner of the 1920s and 1930s. Following the relatively modern A.35, this aircraft was something of a throwback, marrying a fuselage derived from the A.35 to wings copied from the A.23. A few served with CSA, and others with French airline &quot;Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne&quot;. These latter aircraft were powered by a French Gnome-Rhône engine instead.

<doc id="989477" wikidata="Q6942260" url="?curid=989477" title="Music of San Marino">
<text>San Marino is a small sovereign state located within the territory of Italy. It has a musical heritage which includes the 17th-century composer Francesco Maria Marini and the 20th-century composer Cesare Franchini Tassini (1925–2010).

Since 1894, a wordless composition by Federico Consolo has been the national anthem of San Marino. The piece is based on a 10th-century choral composition. The previous anthem was by Aur. Muccioli and U. Balsimelli, and is similar to the Italian national anthem.

The modern military forces of San Marino parade through the streets in full uniform several times a day, accompanied by the sounds of a military brass band.

There is a small metal scene with Necrofilia and Nothing Inside Eyes the latter being formed from another band called Alchimia 2012.

The pop singer Little Tony achieved success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the late 1950s and early 1960s, reaching number 19 on the UK singles chart in 1960, and participating in the Sanremo Music Festival ten times between 1961 and 2008.

San Marino has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times since 2008. The country has reached the final three times in eleven participations. They first qualified in 2014 with Valentina Monetta and her song &quot;Maybe&quot;, where it reached 24th place. They also qualified in 2019 with Turkish singer Serhat (who also represented San Marino in 2016 but failed to qualify) with his song &quot;Say Na Na Na, where it reached 19th place. They also qualified in 2021 with Italian singer Senhit (who represented San Marino in 2011 but failed to qualify and was supposed to represent San Marino in the cancelled 2020 contest) and American rapper Flo Rida with the song &quot;Adrenalina&quot;, which reached 22nd place. Although some international singers have represented San Marino, Sammarinese singer Valentina Monetta has participated four times for the country, Anita Simoncini in 2015, and the Italo-Sammarinese band Miodio debuted for the republic in 2008.

San Marino has also competed three times in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2013, 2014 and 2015, with 10th place in 2013 as its best result.

<text>Jack Penner is a farmer and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 2007, and served in the cabinet of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon.

== Life and career ==
The son of Diedrich A. Penner, he was born in Halbstadt, Manitoba, and worked as a farmer both before and after entering politics. He has served as President of the Keystone Agricultural Producers, the Rhineland Pioneer Centre, and the Rhineland Agricultural Society along with other related organizations. Penner also worked for West Park Motors in Altona for 12 years.

Penner was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 general election, in the rural riding of Rhineland in the province&#x27;s southeastern region. He received 5166 votes, against 1059 for his closest opponent, Liberal Walter Hebert. Penner was subsequently returned for the riding of Emerson in the provincial elections of 1990, 1995, 1999 and 2003, each time by a significant margin. He reportedly considered running for the federal Progressive Conservative Party in 1996, but ultimately declined.

When Gary Filmon was sworn in as Premier on May 9, 1988, he made Penner his Minister of Natural Resources, with responsibility for the Natural Resources Development Act. On April 21, 1989, he was shifted to the Ministry of Rural Development. Penner was dropped from cabinet on February 5, 1991, and was not re-appointed thereafter.

Penner was an active spokesman for farmers affected by the BSE crisis, which kept the United States closed to Canadian beef. On May 19, 2004, he was the leading Progressive Conservative spokesman for an all-party parliamentary resolution on the issue.

He did not seek re-election in 2007.

<doc id="989502" wikidata="Q16191837" url="?curid=989502" title="Music of Samoa">
<text>The Music of Samoa is a complex mix of cultures and traditions, with pre- and post-European contact histories. Since American colonization, popular traditions such as rap and hip hop have been integrated into Samoan music.

Traditional Samoan musical instruments includes several different distinctive instruments, including a fala, which is a rolled-up mat beaten with sticks and several types of slit drum.

== Instruments ==
Traditional Samoan musical instruments included a fala, which is a rolled-up mat beaten with sticks. It is an idiophone which often accompanied choral singing. Another idiophone, a soundingboard, sometimes accompanied the solo recitation of poetry. A conch shell was blown for signaling. Amusement for small groups and individuals in private was afforded by a jaw harp, a raft panpipe, and a nose-blown flute.

Samoan wooden slit drums and variants have been used throughout Samoa for over a thousand years. There are many uses for these wooden drums, including calling village meetings, in times of war and peace, songs/chants and dance, and signalling long distances in inter-island naval warfare. In recent times they are used predominantly for calling chiefly and royal ceremonies as well as contemporary religious practices.

The five Samoan slit drum variants from largest to smallest are:

1) Logo - felled trees - largest of the drums - The logo can only be played by being struck from the side, for instance by sliding the beater or very large log-like playing stick across the top of the drums to hit the slit lip on the other side. The logo was used to announce the king of Samoa, high chiefs and monarchy in times of old. The logo was also used to announce attacks and signals during times of war see re: Samoan Civil War, the Fijian Wars and also the Tongan Wars. Samoa also has recorded historical records of lesser known battles with neighbouring islands of Manono, Pukapuka, Tokelau, Tuamotu and Rarotonga, these battles may be classed as independent isolated skirmishes and inter-Island skirmishes between large familial klan groups.

2) 2 x Lali - large drum - The Lali are always played in pairs by two drummers. One of them beats the larger of the two, this is called the Tatasi, the other drummer plays the smaller Lali in the rhythmic pattern called the Talua. Both slit drums are played with sticks called Auta. The Lali were said to be introduced from Fiji via Tonga before European discovery..

3) Talipalau . The Talipalau skin drum was introduced to Samoa from east Polynesia in the 1800s, possibly as a result of early missionary society activities in both regions.

4) Pate - this hand-held slit drum was introduced from Tahiti in the 1800s, probably by British missionaries or their Tahitian converts.

5) Nafa - smaller slit drum also made from Milo wood. Now obsolete, only the name remains in proverbial expressions.

&quot;Amerika Samoa&quot;, a song with words by Mariota Tiumalu Tuiasosopo and music by Napoleon Andrew Tuiteleleapaga, has been the official territorial anthem of American Samoa since 1950. &quot;The Banner of Freedom,&quot; a song that honors the flag of Samoa, has been the national anthem of Samoa since 1962; it was composed by Sauni Iiga Kuresa.

==Post-European contact==

With the introduction of Christianity, especially after the arrival of LMS missionaries in 1830, the music of Samoa was greatly influenced by Western evangelical hymnody and popular music, particularly North American popular music. Two stringed instruments quickly became commonplace in the islands: the guitar (kitara) and in the early 20th century the &#x27;ukulele. By the end of the 19th century, European-style brass bands had come into existence in the major towns.

As the islands were Christianized late in the 19th century, ancient songs, accompanied by the percussive sound of sticks beating on a rolled mat, gave way to church choirs singing to the harmonies of pedaled organs. Later, radio transmissions brought more variety, as local artists and audiences embraced each wave of &quot;new&quot; music. The arrival of U.S. Marine Corps during World War II helped solidify the affinity for American popular music. Many earlier bands copied or imitated this music—a trend that continues. It is common practice and well accepted for Samoan music makers to take a Western song, replace the lyrics with Samoan words, and reintroduce the tune as an original. The guitar and &#x27;ukulele became the usual instruments for composing and performing music. That sound is now often replaced by the electronic keyboard and the multiplex of sounds and faux instruments available with it. Many current Samoan musicians &quot;upgrade&quot; old Samoan tunes with new technology, or imitate and copy American popular music.

==Modern music==
Modern pop and rock have a large audience in Samoa, as do several indigenous bands, which have abandoned most elements of Samoan traditional music, though there are folksy performers. Some pop musicians in New Zealand learned new dance styles on a trip to the islands of Samoa, an important early node in transmitting and translating U.S street dance to Aotearoa. Recently, the Samoan population has seen a resurgence of old Samoan songs, remixed in the style of Hawaiian reggae, but with some traditional elements, such as the use of the &quot;pate&quot; and the chord structure still in use. New Zealand continues to produce modern popular Samoan stars, such as Jamoa Jam and Pacific Soul. Even traditional hymns (&quot;pese lotu&quot;) have seen a fair amount of change. Some pop bands, such as the RSA Band and the Mount Vaea Band, are associated with hotels; some hotel bands have toured in New Zealand and elsewhere. Pop musicians include the Lole, Golden Ali&#x27;is, The Five Stars, and Jerome Gray, whose &quot;We Are Samoa&quot; remains an unofficial national anthem. A Samoan group called Le Pasefika, going against the current trend by playing only old music, has become the hottest-selling Samoan group in the United States.

The nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music in the United States has significantly affected cultural production in places where Samoans settled, particularly New Zealand. In the early 1980s, Footsoulijah, four Samoan performers from Wellington, credit the Blue City Strutters, who later became the hip-hop group Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E, for spreading their lifelong interest in street dance and their eventual gravitation towards hiphop. Footsoulijah is animated and colorful, and always perform in camouflage fatigues, which represent their militaristic name. The group composed the anthem &quot;Represent for My People,&quot; which includes the chorus &quot;Always represent for my peoples / Pacific islanders of foreign soil / style lethal / take a look as we enter the next chapter / flip the script / Polynesian is my flavour.&quot;

There is currently a dichotomy between old and new in cultural aspects of Samoan life, especially dance. Some assert, &quot;Whereas Samoan music has adopted guitars and other musical instruments, dance, which relies solely upon the performers body (with some exceptions—fire dance, knife dance, etc) still requires the performer to retain grace and move their arms and hands in the approved fashion&quot; but a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article from 1985 shows a &quot;juxtaposition of &#x27;tradition&#x27; and &#x27;modernity&#x27; with two markedly different photographs of Samoan youth.&quot; One photograph has a Samoan child in traditional garb, dancing in a traditional way; the other shows a youth dressed in typical hiphop-style dancing.

Like other Samoans, Kosmo, one of the most famous Samoan hip-hop artists, picked up his dance moves while living in California. He integrated a combination of a bit of strutting, a little boogaloo and popping, and some tutting into his music. He learned the dance while staying with family in Carson, a community that drew large numbers of Samoans relocating from the islands in the 1950s-1970s. As he discovered, popping and other &#x27;street dance&#x27; forms thoroughly saturated the lives of Samoan youth growing up in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Carson and neighboring Compton and Long Beach. He vividly remembers, &quot;all the coolest cats was poppin&#x27; down at [Carson&#x27;s] Scott Park.&quot; When he returned to New Zealand, his vocabulary brought him prestige among his peers, most of whom tried to integrate dance moves from movies. &quot;Kosmo didn’t consider himself any good until he returned to New Zealand. . . . Here they were just doing the basics, he knew more.&quot; For young artists, this hiphop-oriented form of dancing was not only a way to express oneself creatively, but also a powerful sexual tool: “For young men, dance skills also helped to attract the young women who were always present either as critical audience or fellow dancers. As Kosmo recalls, “All the poppers got the girls,” highlighting another case of dance as an equalizing sexual power tool utilized by both sexes in global hip hop. In 1990, Kosmo and two fellow Samoans created The Mau, a hiphop group named for the organization that pushed for Samoan independence under the German and New Zealand colonial administrations. Although the name was rooted in Samoan history, it demonstrates U.S. influences. Similar to the movement of black consciousness in America, the motto for the Mau movement in Samoa was &quot;Samoa Mo Samoa&quot; &#x27;Samoa for Samoans&#x27;. The group continued to articulate a diasporic Samoan cultural nationalism by drawing upon their knowledge of Samoan history, as well as the popular stories of the Black Power movement presently circulating in American hiphop. Their combination of Samoan heritage and American iconography influenced many groups that followed.

Samoans abroad have achieved some musical renown. The Boo-Yaa TRIBE had a brief flirtation with the American mainstream, and the Samoan Sisters found more lasting fame in New Zealand. The shows &quot;My Idol&quot; and &quot;Samoa Star Search&quot; became important musical competitions in Samoa. Modern Samoan music shows influence from electrical instruments, jazz, and reggae, and even some house and techno styles.

==International==
Samoa has produced well-known artists. The band Past To Present / Ilanda (1990–2006) (which consisted of three Samoans and one Māori: Frank Laga&#x27;aia, Lennie Keller, Norman Keller &amp; Leighton Hema; Hema later left the band) gained popularity and commercial success in Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States; its achievement has not yet been equaled by any other islander band. In 2006, it was still in the music industry, touring, recording, or producing, as in its last production of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Young Divas.&quot; A band with a similar career path and success was Kulcha, based in Sydney, which produced two albums but disbanded after a couple of years.

The Katinas, whose parents are Assembly of God Pastors, moved to the United States at one point, are another popular Samoan Gospel band and are active members of the Assembly of God Church. It performed at the Junior Youth Christian Program in Melbourne, Australia, in 2005.

<text>Turisas is a Finnish metal band from Hämeenlinna. They were founded in 1997 by Mathias Nygård and Jussi Wickström, and named after an ancient Finnish god of war.

Turisas plays folk metal, incorporating elements of power metal and symphonic metal along with frequent harsh vocals. They are known to play most of their solos on electric violin, as opposed to traditional guitar solos.

==History==
===&quot;Battle Metal&quot; (2004–2007)===
Since 2003, Turisas have been signed to Century Media Records, which released their debut album &quot;Battle Metal&quot; in 2004. Then the band went on a European tour with various guest musicians on instruments such as violins and accordions.

On 28 October 2005, guitarist Georg Laakso was badly injured in a car accident and due to the extent of his spinal cord injuries, on 12 July 2006 issued a statement of his permanent resignation from the band on the official website. Nevertheless, the band continued to work on their second album, titled &quot;The Varangian Way&quot;, which was released in early 2007. Jussi Wickström recorded all guitars on the album.

Mathias Nygård revealed in the January 2007 edition of Terrorizer magazine that the touring musicians Hannes Horma, Olli Vänskä, Janne Mäkinen and Antti Laurila had been added to the band as full-time members, taking them up to an 8-piece act. It later turned out that of the two accordion players, only Mäkinen had become an official member. Laurila is no longer a touring musician for the band. On 19 February 2007, keyboardist Antti Ventola posted a message on the Turisas discussion forum announcing that he and the band had parted ways. This was later confirmed by the rest of the band. Mathias Nygård performed the keyboards on &quot;The Varangian Way&quot; and Turisas are presently using backing tracks to replicate them on stage.

===&quot;The Varangian Way&quot; (2007–2010)===
In January 2008, accordion player Janne &quot;Lisko&quot; Mäkinen disappeared mysteriously in Amsterdam. For the upcoming tour dates in spring 2008 Turisas announced Netta Skog as a step-in accordionist. She had already helped the band on the European tour in October–November 2007. Netta was soon after added to the band on a full-time basis.

After a string of festivals in the Summer of 2008, in September the band started a long tour through the United States and Europe in support of DragonForce. This tour ended in March 2009, and the band then took part in a new European tour with Cradle of Filth and Moonspell, dubbed the &quot;Filthfest Tour 2009&quot;, in April and May 2009. The band played at Wacken Open Air in early August 2009 and also played at Bloodstock Open Air in mid August 2009. The band took time off at the end of 2009 to make a new album and then planned to return as fully-fledged band no longer supporting others. In 2010 the band concentrated on finishing the recordings of the upcoming third album. Still, the band did a short tour in Asia and Australia in May 2010, including headline concerts in Sydney and Melbourne, two gigs in China, a gig in Shanghai World Expo 2010 and a gig in Japan.

===&quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (2011–2012)===
As of March 2010, Turisas announced they were in the studio working on a new album; at that time, the band documented the recording process in a series of studio diary videos on YouTube. The title for the latest album, &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot;, was revealed on 11 November 2010: the album was released through Century Media on 28 February in Europe and 8 March in North America. A new song off that album: &quot;The March of the Varangian Guard&quot; was performed at the band&#x27;s Finnish gigs in October 2010 On 17 December 2010, the title track &quot;Stand Up And Fight&quot; was released as a free download on the band&#x27;s website.

The band took part in tours in Mexico and North America with Cradle of Filth, the other supporting bands being Nachtmystium and Daniel Lioneye beginning in January 2011 and in Europe with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter from March through April 2011. Their England tour came with Crimfall as the supporting band, as well as other local supporting bands. 2012 saw them headline the North American &quot;Paganfest: America Part III&quot; tour with Alestorm, Arkona and Huntress in tow.

===&quot;Turisas2013&quot; (2013–present)===
In November 2012, the band announced they had started work on their fourth album titled &quot;Turisas2013&quot;. The album was published on 21 August 2013 in Finland and 26 August in Europe, while the UK followed on 2 September and North America on 3 September.

<doc id="989530" wikidata="Q1967350" url="?curid=989530" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">
<text>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA ) is an agency of the U.S. federal government, part of the Department of Transportation, focused on automobile safety regulations.

NHTSA is charged with writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as well as regulations for motor vehicle theft resistance and fuel economy, as part of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) system. FMVSS 209 was the first standard to become effective on March 1, 1967. NHTSA licenses vehicle manufacturers and importers, allows or blocks the import of vehicles and safety-regulated vehicle parts, administers the vehicle identification number (VIN) system, develops the anthropomorphic dummies used in U.S. safety testing as well as the test protocols themselves, and provides vehicle insurance cost information. The agency has asserted preemptive regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions, but this has been disputed by such state regulatory agencies as the California Air Resources Board.

The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are contained in the United States . Additional federal vehicle standards are contained elsewhere in the CFR. Another of NHTSA&#x27;s activities is the collection of data about motor vehicle crashes, available in various data files maintained by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis, in particular the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS, where technicians investigate a random sample of police crash reports), and others.

Other aspects of U.S. traffic safety, including road design, traffic enforcement, and accident investigation are outside of NHTSA&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==History==
In 1964 and 1966, public pressure grew in the United States to increase the safety of cars, culminating with the publishing of &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, by Ralph Nader, an activist lawyer, and the report prepared by the National Academy of Sciences entitled &quot;Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society&quot;.

In 1966, Congress held a series of publicized hearings regarding highway safety, passed legislation to make the installation of seat belts mandatory, and created the U.S. Department of Transportation on October 15, 1966 (). Legislation signed by President Lyndon Johnson earlier on September 9, 1966, included the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act () and Highway Safety Act () that created the National Traffic Safety Agency, the National Highway Safety Agency, and the National Highway Safety Bureau, predecessor agencies to what would eventually become NHTSA. Once the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) came into effect, vehicles not certified by the maker or importer as compliant with US safety standards were no longer legal to import into the United States.

Congress established NHTSA in 1970 with the Highway Safety Act of 1970 (Title II of , at ). In 1972, the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act () expanded NHTSA&#x27;s scope to include consumer information programs. Despite improvements in vehicle design and public awareness of issues like drunk driving, traffic fatalities have remained stubbornly high. In the early 2020s, more than 40,000 U.S. residents died in automotive collisions every year.

NHTSA has conducted numerous high-profile investigations of automotive safety issues, including the Audi 5000/60 Minutes affair, the Ford Explorer rollover problem, and the Toyota sticky accelerator pedal problem. The agency has introduced a proposal to mandate Electronic Stability Control on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year. This technology was first brought to public attention in 1997, with the Swedish moose test. Other than that, NHTSA has issued only a few regulations in the past 25 years. Most of the reduction in vehicle fatality rates during the last third of the 20th century were gained from the initial NHTSA safety standards during 1968–1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle crashworthiness by vehicle manufacturers.

==Regulatory performance==
Audits by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General in 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2021 have concluded that NHTSA is ineffectual; the 2021 audit found NHTSA failing to issue or update Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards effectively or to act within timeframes on petitions and investigations; having no process in place for critical agency responsibilities like evaluating petitions, and having failed to implement consensus recommendations derived from the Inspector General&#x27;s audit a decade before, in 2011. The 2018 audit found NHTSA incapable of conducting adequate, timely safety recalls. The 2015 audit found NHTSA&#x27;s collection and analysis of safety-related data to be inadequate, and the agency to be lackadaisical and careless in examining safety defects.

Government data (from FARS for the U.S.) in a 2004 book by former General Motors safety researcher Leonard Evans shows other countries achieving greater traffic safety improvements over time than those achieved in the United States:
Research suggests one reason the U.S. continues to lag in traffic safety is the relatively high prevalence in the U.S. of pickup trucks and SUVs, which a 2003 study by the U.S. Transportation Research Board found are significantly less safe than passenger cars. Comparisons of past data with the present in the U.S. can result in distortions, due to a significant population increase and since the level of large commercial truck traffic has substantially increased from the 1960s, but highway capacity has not kept up. However, other factors exert significant influence; Canada has lower roadway death and injury rates despite a vehicle mix and regulations similar to those of the U.S. Nevertheless, the widespread use of truck-based vehicles as passenger carriers is correlated with roadway deaths and injuries not only directly by dint of vehicular safety performance &quot;per se&quot;, but also indirectly through the relatively low fuel costs that facilitate the use of such vehicles in North America. Motor vehicle fatalities decline as gasoline prices increase.

In January 2025, NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 877,710 General Motors trucks and SUVs (model years 2019–2024) after receiving 39 complaints and reports of engine failures caused by bearing issues. The probe aims to assess the scope and severity of the problem, with General Motors stating its full cooperation.

== International counterparts and the grey market ==
In 1958, under the auspices of the United Nations, a consortium known as the Economic Commission for Europe was established to standardize vehicle regulations across Europe. Its goals included promoting best practices in vehicle design and equipment and reducing technical barriers to pan-European vehicle trade and traffic. This organization eventually evolved into the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which developed what became the UN Regulations on vehicle design, construction, and safety and emissions performance for vehicles and their components. While many countries adopted or required adherence to the UN Regulations, the United States did not recognize these standards and restricted the importation of vehicles and components not certified by manufacturers as compliant with U.S. regulations.

Because of the unavailability in America of certain vehicle models, a grey market arose in the late 1970s. This provided a method to acquire vehicles not officially offered in the United States, but enough vehicles imported this way were faulty, shoddy, and unsafe that Mercedes-Benz of North America helped launch a successful congressional lobbying effort to close down the grey market in 1988. As a result, it was no longer possible to import foreign vehicles into the United States as a personal import, with few exceptions—primarily vehicles meeting Canadian regulations substantially similar to those of the United States, and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes. In practice, the gray market involved a few thousand cars annually, before its virtual elimination in 1988.

In 1998, NHTSA exempted vehicles older than 25 years from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles. In 1999, certain very low production volume specialist vehicles were also exempt for &quot;Show and Display&quot; purposes.

In the mid-1960s, when the framework was established for US vehicle safety regulations, the US auto market was an oligopoly, with three companies (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) controlling 85% of the market. The ongoing ban on newer vehicles considered safe in countries with lower vehicle-related death rates has created a perception that an effect of NHTSA&#x27;s regulatory activity is to protect the U.S. market for a modified oligopoly consisting of the three U.S.-based automakers and the American operations of foreign-brand producers. It has been suggested that the impetus for NHTSA&#x27;s seeming preoccupation with market control rather than vehicular safety performance is a result of overt market protections such as tariffs and local-content laws having become politically unpopular due to the increasing popularity of free trade, thus driving the industry to adopt less visible forms of trade restrictions in the form of technical regulations different from those outside the United States.

An example of the market-control effects of NHTSA&#x27;s regulatory protocol is found in the agency&#x27;s 1974 banning of the Citroën SM automobile, which contemporary journalists described as one of the safest vehicles available at the time. NHTSA disapproved the SM&#x27;s designs featuring steerable headlamps that were not of the sealed beam design that was then mandatory in the U.S. as well as its height adjustable suspension, which made compliance with the 1973 bumper requirements cost-prohibitive. The initial bumper regulations were intended to prevent functional damage to a vehicle&#x27;s safety-related components such as lights and fuel system components when subjected to barrier crash tests at at the front and at the rear. However, these regulations at low-speed collisions did not enhance occupant safety.

Vehicle manufacturers have acknowledged the functional equivalence of the UN and U.S. regulations, encouraged developing countries to recognize and accept both, and advocated for equal recognition of both systems in developed countries. However, some structural features of the U.S. legal system are incompatible with some aspects of the UN regulatory system. Studies have concluded that commonizing regulations between the US and the rest of the world (which uses U.N. Regulations) would save significant money, likely without affecting safety.

==Cost and cost-benefit==
NHTSA uses cost–benefit analysis for every safety device, system, or design feature mandated for installation on vehicles. No device, system, or design feature may be mandated unless it costs no more than a specified amount of money per life saved, or will save more money (in property damage, health care, etc.) than it costs. Requirements are balanced through estimated costs and estimated benefits. For example, FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal airbags in all new vehicles in the United States, for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements. It has been argued that even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures, airbags&#x27; cost–benefit ratio so extreme that it may fall outside of the cost–benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices. Cost–benefit requirements have been used as the basis for lighting-related regulation in the U.S; for example, while many countries in the world since at least the early 1970s have required rear turn signals to emit amber light so they might be distinguished from adjacent red brake lamps, U.S. regulations permit rear turn signals to emit either amber or red light. This has historically been justified on grounds of lower manufacturing cost and greater automaker styling freedom in the context of no demonstrated safety benefit to amber over red. More recent NHTSA-sponsored research has demonstrated that amber rear turn signals provide significantly better crash avoidance than red ones, and NHTSA has found there is no significant cost penalty to amber signals versus red ones, yet the agency has not moved to require amber—instead proposing in 2015 to award extra NCAP points to passenger vehicles with amber rear turn signals. As of September 2022, however, the agency has not put this proposal into effect.

==Fuel economy==

===CAFE regulations===
NHTSA administers the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), which is intended to incentivize the production of fuel-efficient vehicles by dint of fuel economy requirements measured against the sales-weighted harmonic average of each manufacturer&#x27;s range of vehicles. Many governments outside North America promote fuel economy by heavily taxing motor fuel and/or by including a vehicle&#x27;s weight, engine size, or fuel economy in calculating vehicle registration taxes (road tax).

==NCAP==


In 1979, NHTSA created the/a New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) in response to Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, to encourage manufacturers to build safer vehicles and consumers to buy them. Since that time, the agency has improved the program by adding rating programs, facilitating access to test results, and revising the format of the information to make it easier for consumers to understand. NHTSA asserts the program has influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings.

The United States was the first country/region to have an NCAP program, which was then copied by other NCAP programs.

The first standardized front crash test was on May 21, 1979, and the first results were released on October 15 that year.

The agency established a frontal impact test protocol based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (&quot;Occupant Crash Protection&quot;), except that the frontal 4 NCAP test is conducted at , rather than as required by FMVSS No. 208.

To improve the dissemination of NCAP ratings, and as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA–LU), the agency has issued a Final Rule requiring manufacturers to place NCAP star ratings on the Monroney sticker (automobile price sticker). The rule had a September 1, 2007 compliance date.

<doc id="989533" wikidata="Q1983826" url="?curid=989533" title="Newtown Creek">
<text>Newtown Creek, a long tributary of the East River, is an estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, in New York City. Channelization made it one of the most heavily-used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey and thus one of the most polluted industrial sites in the United States, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City&#x27;s sewer system, and other accumulation from a total of 1,491 sites.

Newtown Creek was proposed as a potential Superfund site in September 2009, and received that designation on September 27, 2010. The EPA has delayed its cleanup until 2032.

==Course==
The creek begins near the intersection of 47th Street and Grand Avenue on the Brooklyn-Queens border at the intersection of the East Branch and English Kills. It empties into the East River at 2nd Street and 54th Avenue in Long Island City, opposite Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan at 26th Street. Its waterfront, and that of its tributaries Dutch Kills, Whale Creek, Maspeth Creek, and English Kills are heavily industrialized. Combined sewer overflow (CSO) pipes drain into all four major tributaries, as well as the East Branch of the creek; during rainstorms, these handle raw sewage.

Because the surrounding neighborhoods are completely sewerized, the creek has little natural inflow of natural freshwater, and is largely stagnant except as a result of tides. Its outgoing flow of per year consists of CSO, urban runoff, raw domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater. There is a layer (in some places ) of polluted sludge that has congealed on the creek bed.

The Lower Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), used primarily for freight, runs along the north bank and across the Dutch Kills via a small movable truss bridge. The abandoned Montauk Cutoff, which connects the branch to the LIRR&#x27;s Main Line runs on a separate bridge over the Dutch Kills located directly north of the Montauk Branch&#x27;s bridge.

=== Tributaries ===
Dutch Kills starts at 47th Avenue and 29th Street in Long Island City, and empties into Newtown Creek on the right bank. The course of Dutch Kills is lined mainly with warehouses. Formerly, its headwaters were at Northern Boulevard and 33rd Street. It formed a navigable stream along with Sunswick Creek to the north, making it easy for merchants to transport produce and goods along the creek.

Whale Creek starts at what is now the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and empties into the creek on the left bank opposite Dutch Kills. It originally extended farther south to Greenpoint Avenue, but was straightened and turned into a canal in the 20th century. Much of the creek was infilled to make way for the treatment plant. Today, the Newtown Creek Nature Walk runs along the remaining spur of the creek.
Maspeth Creek starts on the right bank, within Maspeth, Queens, and runs about before emptying into Newtown Creek. Prior to the industrial development of Queens, Maspeth Creek originated on the Ridgewood Plateau, a plateau that separated the watersheds of Newtown Creek to the south and Flushing River to the east.

English Kills originates from a CSO pipe at 465 Johnson Avenue in East Williamsburg. It drains of sewage annually. The present path of English Kills was straightened in the late 19th century. The Kills is crossed by the LIRR Bushwick Branch and the Metropolitan Avenue Bridge.

The East Branch originates at Metropolitan and Onderdonk Avenues, at a CSO pipe that drains annually. It is crossed only by the Grand Street Bridge. 

==History==

=== Early history ===
The creek derives its name from New Town (Nieuwe Stad), which was the name for the Dutch and British settlement in what is now Elmhurst, Queens. Before the nineteenth century urbanization and industrialization of the surrounding neighborhoods, Newtown Creek was a longer and shallower tidal waterway, wide enough that it contained islands, including Mussel Island and Furman Island. It drained parts of what are now the neighborhoods of Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint in Brooklyn; and Maspeth, Ridgewood, Sunnyside, and Long Island City in Queens.

At the time of the American Revolution, British General Warren had his headquarters along the creek. The Sackett House was inherited by the wife of DeWitt Clinton, and Clinton stayed there during much of the planning of the Erie Canal project. Apples called Newtown Pippins originated on the estate of Gershom Moore there, and soon had a wide reputation, appearing on the &quot;Select List&quot; of apples issues by the Horticultural Society of London, and drawing the praise of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Queen Victoria, who, after tasting the fruit, revoked the import tax on apples.

===Industrialization===
Farmers used the creek to barge their goods to market early in the 19th century, but traffic on the creek increased dramatically when petroleum from Pennsylvania was shipped up the creek to facilities which had once distilled illuminating oil from coal. More refineries sprang up, including Robert Chesebrough&#x27;s for making petroleum jelly, marketed as Vaseline. There was only one refinery in Queens in 1860, but the demand for kerosene and other petroleum products increased the number dramatically, all of which required large parcels of land for storage and processing, as well as pipelines for transporting the product. John D. Rockefeller decided that Standard Oil would be based in the Newtown Creek area, and soon began buying up the refineries of rivals, until by the 1880s the company was processing of crude oil weekly, employing 2,000 people in their more than 100 stills.

The pastoral land around the creek became &quot;a vast interconnected complex of wharves, stills, tanks, and pipelines,&quot; to service not only the refineries, but also the facilities of related industries such as manufacturers of paint and varnish, and chemical companies which produced sulfuric acid. It is estimated that, in all, these industrial facilities produced of waste material each week, which was burnt off, or discarded into the air or the water of the creek. The waste included sludge acid, a tar-like substance which was sold to companies that used it as an ingredient in superphosphate fertilizer. These businesses, which built factories close to the source of their raw material, then dumped their waste into the environment, as did the chemical companies with the sulfur that was the waste from producing sulfuric acid.

By the mid-19th century, Newtown Creek had become a major industrial waterway, with the City of Brooklyn starting to dump raw sewage into it in 1866. It was bounded along most of its length by retaining walls, and the shipping channel was maintained by dredging. Public protests over the degradation of the waterway and the surrounding area, and frequent newspaper exposés did little to ameliorate the problem, considering the economic benefit of the industries located along the creek and nearby. Queens was not yet a part of New York City, meaning that the city&#x27;s Board of Health had no jurisdiction there, and the Brooklyn Board of Health sided with the polluters in court. Even a report from &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1885 that Standard Oil was dumping sludge acid into the creek, covering the banks at low tide, made little difference. By the end of the 19th century, the &quot;Times&quot; was reporting that the creek was totally devoid of any lifeforms.

Oil refineries and distribution depots were concentrated in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Across the creek, in Laurel Hill, later called West Maspeth, chemical plants and copper smelting facilities also polluted the waterway. The largest was the Laurel Hill Chemical Works, owned by Phelps Dodge, which was in operation between 1871 and 1983. At its peak the company employed approximately 1,250 people, but the workforce declined when the company closed the smelter, and eventually the site was sold to the U.S. Postal Service in 1986. When the USPS discovered unacceptable levels of heavy metal waste from the smelting process, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office forced Phelps Dodge to void the sale, take the property back, and to clean it up, which, as of 2016, has not been done.

A canal to connect Newtown Creek with Flushing River was first proposed in the late 19th century. The canal would have flushed out the stagnant water from Maspeth Creek and created a direct route between the two waterways, but was opposed by residents of central Queens, who were against the industrialization of what was then farmland. In 1914, surveys were made for the construction of a canal to connect Flushing River and Newtown Creek, plans for which dated back at least a century. The canal was never built. A dredging project for the creek, approved in 1929, eliminated Mussel Island by the 1930s. Around the same time, the small Shanty Creek on the eastern shore of Furman Island was drained, and the island became part of Maspeth.

==== Notable pollution incidents ====
Before 1950, bulk-oil storage facilities near the corner of Manhattan Avenue and Huron Street were spilling petroleum in amounts that were eventually more than the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill. An underground explosion at the same corner added to the problem. BP, Chevron, and ExxonMobil have since removed half of the spill, about , from the creek and surrounding area, selling the oil that was removed.

In 1973 the Peter van Iderstine plant which had been turning butcher&#x27;s discards and at least one 10-ton elephant into fertilizer, animal feed, and glue since 1855 was charged with contaminating the creek with animal fats. The plant closed two years later but the smell of burning animals lingered.

In 1978 a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter on a routine patrol discovered the Greenpoint oil spill, a discharge that lasted another 30 years and spilled in total three times the oil of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill.

In the early 2000s, during a construction boom, construction companies dumped concrete slurry into the creek. The city fined Empire Transit Mix in 2005 for ridding itself of its slurry through a secret pipe. The discharges of some other companies had pH levels equal to that of household ammonia.


===Cleanup===
The first steps towards cleaning up the toxic environment of Newtown Creek came in 1924, when the federal government passed an oil pollution law, albeit one which had been weakened by the industry as it made its way through Congress.

In 1967 the city built the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is now the largest sewage treatment facility operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Located on the south bank near the creek&#x27;s mouth in Greenpoint, the plant handles a large portion of the drainage from the East Side of Manhattan. Sewage from the Financial District, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Midtown East and the East Side up to 71st Street flows through of sewer pipes into interceptor pipes to the Thirteenth Street Pumping Station at 13th Street and Avenue D, from where it is sent under the East River to the plant. Normal influx is per day, which increases to during wet weather. When a significant overflow occurred during the New York City blackout of 1977 ( of raw sewage spilled into the East River), the federal government ordered in 1995 that the city build back-up facilities. Despite this, the Northeast blackout of 2003 produced of raw sewage spilled.

In 1998, the city started its program to expand the facility. Construction was completed in 2014, and the plant remained opened throughout the renovation process. The plant&#x27;s unusual aesthetics, especially its 140-foot (42 meter) tall metallic &quot;digester eggs&quot; which are illuminated at night with blue lights, have made it a local landmark. In part to appease neighborhood residents who initially opposed the plant&#x27;s expansion, the City of New York built a nature walk alongside Newtown Creek just outside the plant&#x27;s perimeter in 2009. Later, the North Brooklyn Boat Club built a boatyard and education center with funds from the Exxon&#x27;s settlement with the state to allow access to the creek.

Even with the expansion of the plant, as of 2014, the city is still not in full compliance with the 1972 federal Clean Water Act, which mandates that secondary treatment should remove 85% of pollutants from incoming sewage, or with New York State&#x27;s 1992 order for the city to prevent overflows by 2013. Overflows from the Newtown Creek plant on the order of occur on the average of once a week. When that occurs When sewage loads exceed the capacity of the Newtown Creek Sewage Treatment Facility trash, pesticides, petroleum products, PCBs, mercury, cadmium, lead, pathogenic microorganisms, and nutrients which reduce the dissolved oxygen content of the water are dumped into Newtown Creek. This dumping is referred to as a combined sewer overflow or CSO. CSOs can be triggered by as little as a tenth of an inch of rain.Essentially anything that gets washed into the gutters from the street, anything that households and businesses flush down the toilet or dump down the drain, has a fair chance of being expelled directly into Newtown Creek or New York Harbor untreated. In New York City a CSO event occurs once a week on average, discharging approximately 500 million gallons of raw sewage directly into New York Harbor. CSOs are the single largest impairment to the quality of New York City&#x27;s waters. The city requested a postponement of the 2013 deadline in consideration of its plan to build a fully compliant Newtown Creek plant by 2022.

In 2007, residents of Greenpoint, Brooklyn and the New York State Attorney General&#x27;s Office filed lawsuits regarding the Greenpoint oil spill. On September 27, 2010, the federal Environmental Protection Agency designated Newtown Creek as a Superfund site, preparing the way for evaluation and environmental remediation of the stream. Environment advocacy groups supported the decision.

===Public projects===
Plank Road Public Shoreline, located in Queens where 58th Road ends and meets the creek, is a revitalized public access point to the creek founded in 2013 by the Newtown Creek Alliance with support from the NY-NJ Harbor &amp; Estuary Program, the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC) and New York State Department of Conservation. The site features a view of the creek with the borough of Manhattan visible on the other side, a short pathway towards the water, a native pollinator garden, mulched pathways and a plaque detailing the historical significance of the site.

===Murder victims===
Murderer Joel Rifkin dumped a number of his victims into the creek. They were often stuffed into a barrel.

==Water quality==
Although the wastewater treatment plant has been expanded, even small amounts of rainfall can overwhelm the system and lead to the dumping of raw sewage and street runoff directly into the creek from 23 different locations. These combined sewer overflows contribute to ongoing pollution of the creek. The margin between rainfall and sewage overflow only thins with the city&#x27;s further development. In addition, it was reported in December 2013 that in addition to oil and human waste, EPA crews were expected to find toxic substances such as arsenic, caesium-137, and polychlorinated biphenyls.

== Bridges ==

The westernmost crossing of the creek is the Pulaski Bridge, built in 1954 to replace the Vernon Avenue Bridge slightly to the west. Upstream is the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge, built in 1987 to replace bridges that dated to the 1850s. The final bridge upstream, before the convergence of English Kills and the East Branch, is the Kosciuszko Bridge carrying the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (Interstate 278); it was built in 1939 and replaced in 2017–2019.

There are several now-demolished bridges that crossed Newtown Creek. The Vernon Avenue Bridge, connecting Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn with Vernon Boulevard in Queens, was a Warren truss bridge that existed from 1905 to 1954. The Penny Bridge, near the current site of the Kosciuszko Bridge, was a swing bridge connecting Meeker Avenue in Brooklyn with Laurel Hill Boulevard in Queens. Various forms of the Penny Bridge existed from 1803 until the Kosciuszko Bridge was completed in 1939. Finally, the Maspeth Plank Road bridge connected the two sections of Maspeth Avenue in Brooklyn and Queens just north of where English Kills and the East Branch merge. It was eliminated in the late 19th century, having been deemed an obstruction to navigation.

== Houseboats ==
Several houseboats are docked on the Newtown Creek. These include the MV &quot;Schamonchi&quot;, a former Martha&#x27;s Vineyard ferry that ended up in Brooklyn when it was decommissioned and sold in 2005. The Schamonchi served as a squat and a party space, and owners paid to dock it at 190 Morgan. Other boats are rented out to tenants. Most boats are docked on city land, without a marina, so owners do not pay to park their boat. Boat dwellers have faced eviction several times from the city&#x27;s Small Business Services Department and the Transportation Department.

<doc id="989535" wikidata="Q3132751" url="?curid=989535" title="Henry Duncan (minister)">
<text>Henry Duncan FRSE (8 October 1774 – 12 February 1846) was a Scottish minister, geologist and social reformer. The minister of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire, he founded the world&#x27;s first mutual savings bank that would eventually form part of the Trustee Savings Bank. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1839. At the Disruption has left the Church of Scotland and sided with the Free Church. He was also a publisher, a philanthropist and an author, writing novels as well as works of science and religion.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in 1774 at Lochrutton, Kirkcudbrightshire, where his father, George Duncan, was minister. As a boy he met the poet Robert Burns, who visited Lochrutton Manse. Duncan was educated in Dumfries at the Academy. After studying for two sessions at St. Andrews University he was sent to Liverpool to begin commercial life, and under the patronage of his relative, Dr. James Currie, the biographer of Robert Burns, his prospects of success were very fair; but his heart was not in business, and he soon left Liverpool to study at Edinburgh and Glasgow for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. Whilst in Edinburgh he joined the Speculative Society, and became intimate with the political figures, Francis Horner and Henry Brougham.

==Early ministry and works==
In 1798 he was ordained as minister of the Church of Scotland and became Minister at Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire in 1799, where he spent the rest of his life. Duncan from the first was remarkable for the breadth of his views, especially in what concerned the welfare of the people, and the courage and ardour with which he promoted measures not usually thought to be embraced in the minister&#x27;s rôle. In a time of scarcity he brought Indian corn from Liverpool. At the time when a French invasion was dreaded he raised a company of volunteers, of which he was the captain. He published a series of cheap popular tracts, contributing to the series some that were much prized, afterwards collected under the title &quot;The Cottage Fireside&quot;. He originated a newspaper, &quot;The Dumfries and Galloway Courier&quot;, of which he was editor for seven years.

==Savings banks==
The measure which is most honourably connected with Duncan&#x27;s name was the institution of savings banks. He is widely acknowledged to have formed the country&#x27;s first savings bank in 1810, the Ruthwell Parish Savings Bank and Duncan was unceasing in his efforts to promote the cause throughout the country. His influence was used to procure the first act of parliament passed to encourage such institutions. By speeches, lectures, and pamphlets he made the cause known far and wide. The scheme readily commended itself to all intelligent friends of the people, and the growing progress and popularity of the movement have received no check to the present day. Great though his exertions were, and large his outlay in this cause, he never received any reward or acknowledgement beyond the esteem of those who appreciated his work and the spirit in which it was done.

Although Dr Duncan and the Ruthwell Savings Bank were hugely influential, the Bank itself was not a great success. By 1875 only 29 accounts remained, and these were transferred to Annan Savings Bank. The bicentenary of this event was celebrated with a conference held by the Centre for Theology and Public Issues at the University of Edinburgh. Speakers investigated Duncan&#x27;s legacy in light of current social, financial, and religious dynamics. The Savings Bank Museum tells the story of early home savings in Britain.

==Publishing==
Duncan published some work anonymously. In 1821 he published another tale of humble Scottish life, — &quot; The Young South-Country Weaver,&quot; a fit sequel to &quot;The Cottage Fireside.&quot; In 1823 Duncan received the degree of D.D. from the University of St. Andrews. A number of years later (1826) he published, anonymously, a work of fiction in three volumes, &quot; William Douglas; or, The Scottish Exiles,&quot; intended to counteract Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s aspersions on the Covenanters in &quot;Old Mortality.&quot; This was hailed as a work of real genius, and was remarkably well received by the Scottish public. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work which reached ultimately to four volumes, entitled &quot;The Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons&quot;. It was well received, and ran through several editions. He also contributed to Tales of the Scottish Peasantry by Henry Duncan, D.D., and others.

==Antiquarian and geological works==
To the &quot;Transactions of the Scottish Antiquarian Society&quot; he contributed a description of a celebrated runic cross: the Ruthwell Cross (now in Ruthwell church), one of the finest Anglo-Saxon crosses in Britain. This late 7th/early 8th century cross, which he discovered in his parish and restored in 1818, and on which volumes have since been written, is remarkable for its runic inscription, which contains excerpts from &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, an Old English poem.

He made a memorable contribution likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh describing the discovery of the fossil footmarks of four legged vertebrate animals in the Permian red sandstone of Corncockle Quarry, near Lochmaben. The paper, published in 1831, was one of the first two scientific reports of a fossil track (the other being made by Mr. J. Grierson). Duncan also corresponded with the palaeontologist Rev William Buckland about the tracks. A cast of the tracks of &quot;Chelichnus duncani&quot; can be found in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. The original fossils can be seen at Dumfries Museum.

==Church parties and the Disruption==
While at first not very decided between the moderate and the evangelical party in the church, Duncan soon sided with the latter, and became the intimate friend of such men as Dr. Thomas Chalmers and Dr. Andrew Thomson. In the earlier stages of the controversy connected with the Scottish church he addressed letters on the subject to his old college friends Lord Brougham and the Marquis of Lansdowne, and to Lord Melbourne, home secretary.

In 1839 Duncan became Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and at the time of the Disruption of 1843 became one of the founding ministers of the Free Church of Scotland leaving a manse and grounds that had been rendered very beautiful by his taste and skill.

Henry Duncan was visited by Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne during his vacations in Ruthwell.

Duncan was president of a Missionary Society. He also campaigned on behalf of Catholic Relief and on the Emancipation of Slaves.

==Family==
Duncan&#x27;s first wife whom he married in November 1804 was Agnes Craig, daughter of his predecessor, the Rev. John Craig. They had two sons and a daughter. Agnes Duncan died of influenza in 1832. Duncan&#x27;s second wife, whom he married in 1836, was Mary Grey, daughter of George Grey of West Ord, sister of John Grey of Dilston, a well-known Northumbrian gentleman (see memoir by his daughter, Mrs. Josephine Butler) and Henry Grey (a minister), widow of the Rev. R. Lundie of Kelso, and mother of Mary Lundie Duncan and Jane Lundie Bonar. She was a lady of considerable accomplishments and force of character, and author of several books.

Duncan&#x27;s son George John Craig Duncan was born in 1806. He became the minister at Kirkpatrick Durham. His wife was Isabelle Wight Duncan, who was a notable author.

His second son, William Wallace Duncan, born in 1808, was the minister of Cleish and husband of his step-sister Mary Lundie Duncan. Henry Duncan&#x27;s daughter Barbara referred to by Thomas Carlyle as &quot;the bonny little Barbara Duncan&quot; married the Rev. James Dodds of Dunbar.

==Death and legacy==
Duncan was a man of most varied accomplishments – manual, intellectual, social, and spiritual. With the arts of drawing, modelling, sculpture, landscape-gardening, and even the business of an architect, he was familiar, and his knowledge of literature and science was varied and extensive. In private and family life he was highly estimable, while his ministerial work was carried on with great earnestness and delight. The stroke of paralysis that ended his life on 19 February 1846 fell on him while conducting a religious service in the cottage of an elder.

The headquarters of TSB Bank (a descendant of the original Trustee Savings Bank) at 120 George Street is named Henry Duncan House.

<doc id="989544" wikidata="Q935086" url="?curid=989544" title="Music of Qatar">
<text>The music of [[Qatar]] is based on sea folk poetry, song and dance. The historical importance of pearl fishing have deeply resonated within the region&#x27;s artistic expression, manifesting in melodies, tunes, and dances that reflect the enduring bond between humanity and the sea. Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylized martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), mirwas and cymbals with small drums. Other folk instruments include the oud and rebaba, both string instruments, as well as the ney and sirttai, which are types of flutes.

Music has served multiple cultural purposes in Qatar in the past, ranging from being used in weddings and other celebrations to religious rituals, as lullabies (&quot;hadhada&quot;), and in military parades. Workers would also sing amidst the toil of their daily tasks, mainly during sea-based activities. In contemporary times, &quot;khaliji&quot; (&#x27;gulf&#x27;) music has gained in popularity among the locals. As immigration to Qatar rapidly increased throughout the 21st century, foreigners have come to dominate the country, resulting in the widespread appearance of musical genres such as Bollywood music, western pop music and Egyptian music.

==History==
The country&#x27;s first musical troupe was created in Doha in 1966 by Abdulaziz Nasser Al Obaidan under the name &quot;Al Adwaa&quot;. One of the band&#x27;s founding members was Ibrahim Ali, who is considered a pioneer in Qatari music and who specialized in playing the oud. In 1968, Qatar Radio introduced a music segment in its programming, mainly due to the efforts of Al Obaidan.

In 1991, it was noted in &quot;Al-ughniya al-sha biyya f Qatar&quot; that there were at least 26 folk music bands, including several female ones. Many of the band members had full-time employment outside of music. Band expenses were paid for by royalties for appearing on Qatar Television and radio stations, as well as performing at events such as weddings. Among the most well-known artists of this era are Saeed bin Salem Al-Badie Al-Mannai, Rashid Almas, and Salem Faraj.
Qatar adopted its current national anthem, &quot;As-Salam al-Amiri&quot;, on 6 December, 1996, shortly after Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani became emir. Composed by Abdulaziz Nasser Al Obaidan, a veteran musician who had been active in Qatar&#x27;s music scene since the 1960s, the lyrics are based on a poem written by prolific poet Mubarak bin Saif Al Thani.

==Folk music traditions==
A distinctive social tradition among the Persian Gulf people involves communal gatherings known as the &quot;majlis&quot;, where friends and neighbors convene to discuss matters of mutual interest over cups of Arabic coffee. These gatherings occasionally serve as platforms for various forms of folk arts. In the past, the &quot;dour,&quot; or spacious rooms designated for these gatherings, hosted seafarers, dhow captains (noukhadha), and enthusiasts of folk arts between pearl fishing seasons. Here, they engaged in &quot;al-samra&quot;, evenings of song and dance, which have become integral to Gulf heritage, celebrated during weddings and other occasions for entertainment.

At &quot;al-samra&quot; gatherings, singers accompanied by stringed instruments like the oud and occasionally the violin perform melodies while being joined by dancers performing &quot;al-zafan&quot;. This traditional dance, characterized by elegant movements and expressive gestures, symbolizes the hardships and joys of maritime life.

==Male folk music==

Male folk music could be categorized as urban or sea music and work or non-work related. Work songs vary significantly depending on the environment. The pastoral setting differs from the agricultural, coastal, and urban environments, each possessing its own distinct culture, specific tasks, and unique forms of production. Qatar&#x27;s environment, being predominantly coastal due to its peninsula geography, shapes the lives and work of its people around the sea, fostering cooperation and community engagement. Within this coastal setting, there exist songs whose rhythms are synchronized with various work movements such as pushing ships, hoisting sails, rowing oars, and pulling ropes. These collective work songs reflect the collaborative efforts of the workers.

Additionally, individual songs, not originally intended as work songs but borrowed from other contexts, also appear to a lesser extent in Qatar&#x27;s musical tradition. Common themes among these songs are love and marriage. An example of one such song is &quot;Tal al-Sadoud&quot;, which is about the affection one has for their partner. Despite not originally being a work song, this song has been frequently used on pearling trips as a reminder of the sailors&#x27; loved ones at home. Kuwaiti and Iraqi folk songs were often popular with Qatari sea-farers, for example, the Iraqi song &quot;Al Haliya&quot; which is sung in the &quot;wafir&quot; meter. Classical Qatari melodies share many similarities with their Gulf counterparts, and most of the same instruments are used.

===Sea music===

Work songs relating to the sea are the most recurrent type of folk music, particularly songs about pearl hunting. Each song, varying in rhythm, would narrate a different activity of the pearling trip, including spreading the sails, diving, and rowing the ships. Collective singing was integral to each pearling trip, and each boat had a designated singer, known locally as &quot;al naham&quot;. Singing was used to encourage crew members to work harder during the pearling drip and provide entertainment while resting. Furthermore, when the &quot;noukadha&quot; (captain) ordered the sails to be rigged, the crew would sing while the &quot;al naham&quot; would give praise to Allah and Muhammad. Such songs which praised Allah or asked for his blessing was known as a &quot;holo&quot; song.
Holo songs have simple melodies which often center around a single verse that is repeated, either by the &quot;al naham&quot; solely or as a group performance. This rhythmic phrase does not vary in vocal tone; instead, percussion instruments and clapping are used to amplify the melody.

A type of sea music known as fijiri originated from sea traditions and features group performances accompanied by melodic singing, rhythmic palm-tapping on water jars (known as &quot;galahs&quot;), and evocative dances that mimic the movements of the sea waves. Various versions of al-fujairi, such as &quot;al-bahri,&quot; &quot;al-adsani,&quot; and &quot;al-hadadi,&quot; offer diverse expressions of this art form, each characterized by unique performances and styles of dancing.

===Dance===

Ardah, a folkloric dance, is still practiced in Qatar. The dance is performed with two rows of men opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword, and is accompanied by drums and spoken poetry. The two main types of ardah in the Persian Gulf states are land ardah (&quot;ardah barriyya&quot;) and sea ardah (&quot;ardah bahri&quot;). Qatar&#x27;s ardah is a mixture of the two. In some performances, men wear land ardah attire at a beach setting and are supported by sea band drumming. It is sometimes performed on horseback. The purpose of ardah, historically, was to honor one&#x27;s tribe and to showcase courage. It is considered a celebration of the highest degree and is performed at important events such as royal weddings, high-ranking governmental visits, and national feasts. Ardah performances are sometimes followed by &quot;al-razeef&quot;, a dance where the performer has his head in an upright position and is carrying a weapon.

&quot;Tanboura&quot; was a simple type of folk dance performed by a group of men. Historically, it served a social function as it was believed the dancers would exorcise an evil spirit from the target of this dance and was rewarded handsomely. The dance consists of conflicting rhythmic movements and is dominated by a drum beat. An oud and manjur are also used. In modern times, this dance evolved to be used during celebratory occasions such as weddings and feasts. A dance with a similar historical purpose is called Liwa; this dance involves a large flute known as a &quot;sirttai&quot;, a tin container known as a &quot;tanaka&quot;, and loud singing.

During Ramadan, grain grinding would sometimes be accompanied by a dance known as &quot;dakelhab&quot;; the name being the Arabic term for grinding grains. Other dances include &quot;al matari&quot;, &quot;al samiri&quot;, and &quot;al rijali&quot;.

==Female folk music==

Women primarily sang work songs associated with daily activities such as wheat grinding and cooking. The songs were performed collectively in small groups and varied in specificity - some pertained to general themes, whereas others were related to specific processes. In the past, women and men would perform alongside each other, but this later became less common.

Women would also sing when returning pearl ships were sighted. After a sighting was made, they would gather around the seashore where they would clap and sing about the hardships of pearl diving. One of the most popular Qatari folk songs of this nature is &quot;Toub Toub Ya Bahar!&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Ocean waters, repent!&quot;. This song was historically sung by women standing by the coastline, anxiously awaiting the safe return of their male family members from their pearl diving expeditions. The song is an impassioned plea, urging the sea to remain calm to ensure the safe return of their loved ones.

Fatma Shaddad is a pioneer in female folk music, forming the country&#x27;s first-ever female band. Her band performed at venues throughout Qatar and had its music broadcast on Qatar Radio beginning in 1986. Her most popular song was &quot;Gharby hawakom ya ahl el Doha&quot; (), released in 1988, which was played and adapted by other artists all over the Persian Gulf region. The song was also played during Qatar&#x27;s diplomatic functions. After her original band dissolved, in 1996 she founded the Nahda Women’s Band for Folk Arts. In 2012, during the theatrical play of &quot;Al-Bushiya&quot;, Shaddad played the role of the grandmother Umm al-Khair, and introduced a novel element by performing &quot;Al-Nahham&quot;, a traditional sea music form typically sung by men during fishing trips. Her participation marked the first time a woman has performed this art on stage in the Gulf, with choreography and music designed by Mohamed Al-Sayegh.

===Nursery rhymes and lullabies===
Folk nursery rhymes serve as a medium for transmitting cultural values, educational information, and social norms to children within Qatari society. These rhymes often incorporate elements from the local surroundings, occupations, and traditions, facilitating the enculturation process from an early age. The most common type of nursery rhyme is commonly referred to as &quot;tasbeeha&quot;, or &quot;morning songs&quot;.

Other types of folk rhymes exist, such as songs related to teething (&quot;al noon&quot;), the memorization of the Quran (&quot;al khattima&quot;), and religious songs. Lullabies, songs used to quiet the baby or lull them to sleep, are referred to locally as &quot;hadhada&quot;.

===Dance===

Public performances by women were practiced on two annual occasions. The first was , which involved women and girls of all social classes gathering in a secluded area where they would sing and dance in embroidered clothes. This was usually done in the weeks preceding Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. It was one of the most popular musical practices among Qatari women in previous decades. Each moradah would begin with a prayer to Muhammad. After this, the women would praise tribal leaders and elders, repeating each verse twice before introducing a new verse. It was performed with two rows of women opposite each other, with the lead singers at the far ends, thus forming a three-sided rectangle. Moradah&#x27;s dance consisted of all the women in each row swaying their bodies and moving their arms up and down while their hands were interlaced. For the most part, the practice was abandoned during the 1950s, though it is still sometimes practiced at the end of weddings. There have been efforts by Qatar&#x27;s Ministry of Culture to reintegrate the practice into Qatari society.

The second occasion of collective public singing, known as , was performed exclusively at weddings. There were two main instruments used during a performance: &quot;al douf&quot; (or &quot;daf&quot;), a type of tambourine, and &quot;al tabl&quot;, a longitudinal drum. Thematically, songs are cheerful as they rejoice in the marriage that is taking place. The lyrics are derived from Nabati verse, a type of Arabic poetry and were generally symbiotic in nature. is still practiced by some classes of Qatari society.

==Children&#x27;s folk music==
Children&#x27;s folk songs encompassed a wide array of vocal expressions, ranging from simple chants to melodic mawwals. Typically devoid of musical accompaniment, these songs were of great cultural significance. Often characterized by hand clapping and rhythmic patterns, folk songs facilitated group cohesion and were easily memorized, particularly among children. As children progressed through various developmental stages, folk songs tailored to each phase played a role in their upbringing, from lullabies soothing newborns to celebratory tunes marking milestones like teething and first steps. Moreover, social gatherings and communal events were punctuated by various songs encompassing religious, social, and political themes.

&quot;Al-Tahmida&quot;, a chant venerating Muhammad, symbolized the completion of Quranic memorization, inspiring peers to follow suit. &quot;Taq Taq ya Mattar&quot; expressed joy at rainfall, while &quot;Bal-houta hadi amarna&quot; was chanted during lunar eclipses. &quot;Ihmido yal qalqani&quot; uplifted children, while &quot;Bil nafila yammul shahm wal lahm&quot; was sung during the mid-Sha&#x27;ban month&#x27;s fast, signifying anticipation of treats from neighbors in a tradition called Garangao. On festive occasions like Eid al-Fitr, songs such as &quot;Baker Al-Eid&quot; and &quot;Al-Ayedoh&quot; united children and adults in joyful celebration.

&quot;Al-Farisa&quot; was a dance done only during Gurangao, a regional holiday that takes place on the 15th night of Ramadan. It would be performed by a group of young boys wearing a bisht and &quot;dakla&quot; who form a circle, which is then enclosed by a larger circle of adults. The conclusion of this dance would be with the arrival of a young boy on a fake horse with a play sword, which the boy then uses to duel the horse. The &quot;douf&quot; is used for this dance and is accompanied by singing.

==Folk music in poetry==

Nabati poetry, a type of poetry endemic to the Arabian Peninsula, is thought to represent the first vestiges of folk music in the region. Rababas were sometimes used during recitations of Nabati poetry, a practice referred to as rababa art. The rababa is a stringed instrument dominant in Bedouin culture, similar to the oud. While narrating their poem, which typically would be centered around the hardships of the desert or other such pains, the poet would slowly but rhythmically strum the rababa. Such performances have declined drastically in popularity in modern times, primarily due to their sorrowful nature.

==Folk instruments==
Over 90 traditional folk songs, both urban and sea, have been recorded in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, many employing percussion instruments and string instruments, while others use only simple clapping or foot stomping or employ all in conjunction.

Traditional musical instruments have undergone extensive refinement processes over time, resulting in their current compact forms. An example of this transformation is evident in the mirwas, which originally existed as a large, rudimentary drum but has since evolved into a smaller instrument, slightly larger than the palm, yet remains an integral component of folklore troupes.
Constructed from carved wooden tubes covered on both ends with goatskin, the mirwas was traditionally handcrafted by specialized artisans in the Persian Gulf region, where the leather coating industry flourished. However, contemporary manufacturing of the mirwas is predominantly conducted in India. Typically played by holding it with the fingertips of the left hand and striking it with the forefinger of the right hand, the rhythmic tapping of the mirwas complements various urban melodies and Gulf vocal songs, including &quot;al-arabi&quot;, &quot;al-shami&quot;, &quot;al-rudmani&quot;, and &quot;al-khayali&quot;.

In addition to the mirwas, several other traditional instruments are well-known in the region. The douf, similar to a tambourine, features goatskin coating on one side, while the oud, resembling a violin, is a stringed instrument. Similarly, the rababa shares similarities with the oud. &quot;Galahs&quot;, a tall clay jar, was commonly used as a percussion instrument by pearl fishermen. Tin drinking cups known as &quot;tus&quot; or &quot;tasat&quot; were also used, usually in conjunction with a &quot;tabl&quot;, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick.

Notably, hand-clapping (&quot;taṣfīq&quot;) is an essential musical instrument in Gulf musical traditions, accompanying vocal songs. In the Persian Gulf region, rhythmic clapping is performed by groups of men seated in rectangular formations around musicians, with participants ranging from 10 to 40. Clapping sessions typically begin with one to three individuals, gradually incorporating others with rhythmic variations and culminating in uniform clapping. While minor infractions may be acknowledged with a simple glance, repeated mistakes may result in exclusion from the session. Various clapping styles exist, including &quot;grand clapping&quot;, &quot;bizani&quot;, &quot;al-khabab&quot;, and synchronized finger and tongue movements, each adhering to its own set of rules and conventions.

==Preservation of folk music==
The first time an exhaustive study of Qatari folk music took place was in 1975, when the Department of Publishing and Publications at the Ministry of Information published a book of popular songs in Qatar, releasing it in four parts. Sheikh Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani, who was minister of the Ministry of Information and Culture, commissioned Muhammad Talib Al-Duwayk to publish a new book on Qatar&#x27;s music, resulting in the publishing of &quot;Al-ughniya al-sha biyya f Qatar&quot; (in English: &quot;The Folk Song in Qatar&quot;) in 1990. Released in two volumes, the book explores every aspect of Qatar&#x27;s folk music and culture.

The Arab Gulf States Folklore Centre was founded in Doha, Qatar, in 1981 with the objective of preserving the region&#x27;s culture and history, including folk music.

==Music organizations==
===Music institutions===
In August 1980, the Ministry of Information established a subsidiary organization to serve as a music academy, referring to it as &quot;the Institute&quot;. An academy building was provided to the institute by the government, and it began classes on 1 October 1980 with an initial capacity for 20 aspiring musicians.

In 2007, the Ministry of Culture inaugurated the Center of Music Affairs. It aims to disseminate musical knowledge, cultivate a new generation of musicians, and support initiatives that uphold and preserve the tradition of Qatari music. The center hosts an annual event known as &quot;The Night of the Qatari Song&quot;, dedicated to celebrating the distinct qualities of Qatari music. It also serves as a venue for various musical and spoken word performances.
Qatar Foundation was responsible for commissioning the Qatar Music Academy in Katara Cultural Village in January 2011. Although the academy&#x27;s primary focal point is providing musical education for children and teenagers from 5 to 18 years old, it also provides education for individuals not falling within that age bracket through its &#x27;music for all&#x27; program.

===Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra===
The Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra was formed in 2007 at the behest of Qatar Foundation with an initial budget of $14 million.

===Recording companies===
The first Qatari record label was established in January 2015 by Dana Al Fardan as &quot;DNA Records&quot;.

==Festivals and concerts==
Sawt Al-Khaleej Radio established the Doha Song Festival in February 2002.

Qatari Songs Night (&quot;Layl al-ughniya al-Qaṭariyya&quot;), an event where local singers perform traditional songs, took place for the first time in the Qatar National Theatre in 2020. It was organized by the Center of Music Affairs, a sub-department of the Ministry of Culture.

==Contemporary music==

Local music artists are subject to many barriers in Qatar, such as lack of awareness, high prices of recording studios and a deficiency of agents.

===Arabic/gulf music===
Many contemporary Qatari singers perform what is popularly known as &quot;khaliji&quot; (&#x27;gulf&#x27;) music. Notable male artists in this genre include Fahad Al Kubaisi, the first artist out of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf to be nominated for a Grammy award, Essa Al Kubaisi, Ali Abdul Sattar, and Bader Al Rayes.

As a tribute to renowned folk singer Salem Faraj, Mansour Al-Muhannadi remade his song &quot;Blessed Be Our Eid&quot;, composed by Qatari poet Khalifa Jumaan. Qatar TV produced the music video for this song and aired it throughout Eid al-Fitr.

===Patriotic music===
Patriotic songs serve as a medium for expressing national identity and collective sentiment. These compositions have played a crucial role in shaping and reflecting public opinion, for instance, during the Qatar diplomatic crisis. The lyrical content of patriotic songs encompasses a wide range of themes, including religious devotion, martial prowess, love for the homeland, loyalty to leadership, and pride in national achievements. Common motifs include references to swords, symbolizing strength and heritage; flags and masts, representing national sovereignty; and elements of the local environment.

Patriotic songs are often released around Qatar National Day, on 18 December 2018. They may be accompanied by live musical performances that feature the ardah, with the dancers hoisting swords. The performances are broadcast on Qatar TV and other local stations. One of the most popular local artists singing such songs is Nayef Albishri, who performed &quot;Imar Ya Dar Althamimi&quot;, with the lyrics being authored by Khalid Al Boainain, and &quot;Ya Labba&quot;, with the lyrics being made by Abdullah Albeshri. Khalil Al Shabrami, a poet dubbed &quot;Shayr Al-Million&quot;, is another popular artist who sang &quot;Tamim Aali Mistawa&quot;, which was accompanied by an ardah performance.

Nadir Abdul Salam, an Indian musician and ambassador of Qatar Music Academy, is known for producing several patriotic songs, such as the official song of the 24th Arabian Gulf Cup, held in Qatar. He is also known for producing various Qatar National Day songs, including four in 2020 and three in 2019.

===Metal/rock===
Naser Mestarihi, a Qatari born Jordanian-Pakistani singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, became the first rock/metal musician to release an album out of Qatar. He was also a member of Qatar&#x27;s first-ever metal band Asgard Legionnaires.

===Orchestral music===
Dana Al Fardan, whose music has been described as &quot;rooted in neoclassical music and electronic elements&quot;, made history by being the first artist from a Persian Gulf country to perform at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2024, presenting her song &quot;Indigo&quot;.

===Martial music===
Martial music in Qatar has a rich history that reflects the nation&#x27;s cultural heritage and military traditions. Originating in 1949, Qatar&#x27;s military music ensemble began with the introduction of the trumpet for various ceremonial purposes, including flag ceremonies and saluting. Over the years, the ensemble evolved into the Qatar Armed Forces Band Regiment, originally named the &quot;Music Unit of the Armed Forces&quot;, established in 1954.
From its humble beginnings, the music unit expanded to incorporate brass bands, bagpipers, and percussionists. The establishment of the first and second martial bands occurred in 1982. Subsequently, between 1998 and 2010, the establishment expanded to encompass four integrated music bands alongside the establishment of the Symphony Band Music School.

The role of the music school within the battalion is paramount, offering rigorous training programs for soldiers lasting 8-10 years. These programs encompass various musical courses, including foundational music training, progressive courses, and leadership training. Soldiers are taught to perform various musical pieces, including marches and waltzes, enabling them to participate in a multitude of ceremonies and events, such as National Sports Day, Qatar National Day and the opening ceremony of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Qatar&#x27;s military music has not only played a crucial role in national ceremonies but has also represented the nation on the international stage. Foreign dignitaries are greeted at the Amiri Diwan with performances on arrival. The band regiment has participated in numerous international festivals across the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, Europe, the US, and China, showcasing Qatari songs intertwined with Western instrumentals, particularly bagpipes.

<doc id="989564" wikidata="Q6943350" url="?curid=989564" title="Mustafa al-Hawsawi">
<text>Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi (; born August 5, 1968) is a Saudi Arabian citizen. He is alleged to have acted as a key financial facilitator for the September 11 attacks in the United States.

Mustafa al-Hawsawi was captured in Pakistan by Pakistani agents in March 2003 and was transferred to the custody of the United States. He was held in secret CIA black sites until September 2006, when he was transferred to Guantánamo Bay and U.S. officials finally acknowledged his imprisonment. It detained him at the Salt Pit, a secret black site in Afghanistan. It was reported in August 2010 that, after months of interrogation, the CIA transferred al-Hawsawi and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo Bay detention camp on September 24, 2003, for indefinite detention. Fearing that &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;, a pending Supreme Court case about detainees&#x27; habeas corpus rights, might result in having to provide the men with access to counsel, the CIA took back custody on March 27, 2004, and transported the four men to one of their black sites.

It has long been known that, during al-Hawsawi&#x27;s CIA captivity, his captors injured him, causing him to suffer from anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and, most seriously, symptomatic rectal prolapse.
When the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,000-page report on the CIA&#x27;s use of torture, the world learned that the CIA routinely punished its captives by sodomizing them, claiming the sodomy was the long abandoned medical technique of rectal feeding. The United States Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s investigation of the CIA&#x27;s Torture Program revealed that detainees were routinely subjected to unnecessary rectal exams without evidence of medical necessity for purposes of behavioral control. CIA leadership, including General Counsel Scott Muller and DDO James Pavitt, were alerted to allegations that rectal exams were conducted with &quot;excessive force&quot; on two detainees at the Salt Pit detention site. CIA records indicate that one of the detainees, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, was later
diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse.

Al-Hawsawi was transferred from CIA custody to military custody at Guantanamo on September 6, 2006. The Bush administration was then confident of the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which restricted detainee use of habeas corpus, and prohibited them from using the federal court system (this provision was, however, ruled unconstitutional in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008), and numerous habeas corpus petitions were refiled in the federal courts). Al-Hawsawi remains incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. On July 31 2024, Al-Hawsawi agreed to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. His plea deal was revoked by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin two days later.

== Alleged role in 9/11 attacks ==
Although it is alleged that al-Hawsawi was a member of al-Qaeda, he stated in a Combatant Status Review Hearing that he is not a member of al-Qaeda, and never swore an oath of allegiance to Osama bin Laden.

Al-Hawsawi had previously worked in Al-Qaeda&#x27;s media committee and was selected by Khalid Shaikh Mohammad to assist as a travel and financial facilitator for the hijackers. This was done after Mohammed&#x27;s nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, requested assistance with helping the hijackers. Mohammed stated Al-Hawsawi was one of the main contacts for the hijackers while they were in the U.S and that Mohammed&#x27;s knowledge about the pilots mainly came from Al-Hawsawi or Ramzi Binalshibh.

Al-Hawsawi was charged with being in the United Arab Emirates starting in April 2001, and would help send the last four operatives (other than Mihdhar) to the U.S and assisted them by purchasing clothing, food, lodging, rental cars, traveler&#x27;s checks, and making travel arrangements. Hawsawi&#x27;s role as a financial facilitator appeared to have begun when hijacker Banihammad helped Hawsawi complete an account application in the UAE and granted him power of attorney over his account so Hawsawi could forward the bank card to him in the US; $4,900 was subsequently deposited into this account by Hawsawi. Between June, 2001 and September, 2001, Al-Hawsawi collected money, packages and provided various sums money to the hijackers. In early September 2001, hijackers started sending Hawsawi a series of wire transfers totaling about $28,000 — apparently unspent advances on expenses — from addresses in Broward County, Florida and Boston. Al-Hawsawi would later comment that as the money flowed in, he came to understand that &quot;an operation&quot; would soon happen.

On September 11, 2001, Al-Hawsawi traveled from the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan. Al-Hawsawi said that he first learned of the 9/11 operation following the attacks and was surprised by the size of the 9/11 operation.

Al-Hawsawi&#x27;s arrest on March 1, 2003, in Pakistan was unrelated to any reporting from CIA detainees. He was reportedly taken to the U.S. Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. The CIA maintained a detention and interrogation site there. This was not confirmed by U.S. officials. 

On July 31 2024, Al-Hawsawi agreed to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty, but his plea was revoked by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin two days later.

== CIA custody ==
Al-Hawsawi was held in secret CIA custody for several years.
When the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,000-page classified report on the CIA&#x27;s use of torture, it became known that al-Hawsawi was held in several CIA black sites during his years in secret detention, where he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques which amounted to torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. In particular, the report revealed that:
* Al-Hawsawi had been held in detention site COBALT, believed to be situated in Afghanistan, in 2003. There he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, including water dousing without the approval from CIA headquarters and to rectal examinations conducted with &quot;excessive force&quot;, leading to a diagnosis of chronic hemorrhoids, anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse;
* During his detainment at detention site VIOLET, believed to be located in Lithuania, al-Hawsawi required emergency medical care, but officers denied him access to a local hospital.

Moreover, the findings of the Senate Report raised doubts about Al-Hawsawi&#x27;s detention, identifying him as one of a number of individuals who were detained under the CIA&#x27;s program &quot;despite doubts and questions surrounding [his] knowledge of terrorist threats and the location of senior al-Qa&#x27;ida leadership&quot;. In fact, after his first interrogation, the Chief of Interrogations wrote to CIA Headquarters saying that al-Hawsawi &quot;does not appear to the [sic] be a person that is a financial mastermind.&quot;

== Questions from Salim Ahmed Hamdan&#x27;s defense attorney ==

On April 23, 2008, attorneys working on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan requested permission to meet with Abdulmalik Mohammed and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Hamdan&#x27;s attorneys had previously requested permission to get the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; to answer written questions. They believed the men would confirm that if Hamdan played a role in al Qaeda, it had been a peripheral one. Abdulmalik Mohammed and Mustafa al-Hawsawi declined to answer the questions, because they said they had no way to know that the questions purporting to be from Hamdan&#x27;s attorneys were not a ruse. Andrea J. Prasow requested permission for Lieutenant Commander Brian Mizer to meet in person with the two men to try to assure them that the questions were not a ruse, and would not be shared with their interrogators.

== Military commission trial ==
In June 2008, al-Hawsawi and four other &quot;high-value detainees&quot; (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Walid Bin Attash) were charged with crimes brought before the Guantanamo military commission. The charges included 2,973 individual counts of murder, one for each person killed in the September 11 attacks, as well as conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, terrorism, and providing material support for terrorism. The judge ordered al-Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh to undergo mental competency hearings. On December 8, 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to confess and plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after the competency hearings for al-Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh, so that all five men could make their plea together. The charges against all five were dismissed on January 21, 2010, before a plea was entered.

In May 2009, &quot;Al Arabiya&quot; reported that Montasser al-Zayyat, a prominent Egyptian attorney, had been invited to defend al-Hawsawi. Al Zayat described suspecting, at first, that he was the target of a hoax.

On August 31, 2009, &quot;Corrections One&quot;, a trade journal for the prison industry, proclaimed that &quot;Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi&quot; was one of ten captives they speculated might be moved to a maximum security prison in Standish, Michigan.

== Official status reviews ==
Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the &quot;war on terror&quot; were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.
In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

=== Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants ===
Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.

Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations, as follows:

* Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawasawi was listed as one of the captives who had faced charges before a military commission.

==United States Senate Torture Report==
On December 9, 2014, a redacted executive summary of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture was publicly released. This executive summary revealed the following information regarding al-Hawsawi&#x27;s torture:
*He was subjected to rectal examinations conducted with excessive force and was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse.
*He was subjected to water dousing without approval from CIA Headquarters in a manner that was indistinguishable from waterboarding. This became the subject of a Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General investigation.
*He was hospitalized for a medical emergency that occurred during his torture.

== Amnesty International, USA Campaign ==
On December 7, 2015, Amnesty International, USA launched a campaign to raise awareness regarding al-Hawsawi&#x27;s military commission trial, which they alleged violates international fair trial standards by frustrating the truth seeking process by impeding transparency and denying accountability for torture.

== Human Rights bodies&#x27; criticism of al-Hawsawi&#x27;s detention ==

=== UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ===
On January 23, 2015, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention held that al-Hawsawi&#x27;s ongoing detention in Guantánamo Bay was arbitrary, and in contravention of articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

=== Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ===
On July 7, 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on precautionary measures regarding al-Hawsawi requesting the United States of America, inter alia, to adopt the necessary measures to protect the life and personal integrity of al-Hawsawi, and to adopt the necessary measures to ensure access to medical care and treatment.

== Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment ==
On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts.
His seven-page Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment was drafted on December 8, 2006.
It was signed by deputy camp commandant Brigadier General Edward L. Secord.
He recommended continued detention.

<text>The Aero A.42 was a Czechoslovakian bomber aircraft of 1929 that was only ever produced in prototype form. For its day, it was an advanced design, with a sleek monoplane configuration. However, the Czechoslovak Air Force was not satisfied with it for a number of reasons. In particular, the aircraft&#x27;s take-off and landing runs were felt to be excessively long, and crew complained about the cramped cabin. The air force suggested a set of modifications to Aero, including replacing the wooden wing with a metal one, but Aero discontinued development.

On September 20, 1930, one of the two prototypes set international speed records of over a closed circuit, carrying payloads of and .

One prototype was used by the Czechoslovak Air Force until 1938, then by the Slovak Air Force. Probably it was scrapped in 1940.

The A.42 was a single-engined high-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed landing gear.

<text>John Brewster Hattendorf, FRHistS, FSNR, (born December 22, 1941) is an American naval historian. He is the author, co-author, editor, or co-editor of more than fifty books, mainly on British and American maritime history and naval warfare. In 2005, the U.S. Naval Institute &quot;Proceedings&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most widely known and well-respected naval historians in the world.&quot; In reference to his work on the history of naval strategy, an academic in Britain termed him the &quot;doyen of US naval educators.&quot; A Dutch scholar went further to say that Hattendorf &quot;may rightly be called one of the most influential maritime historians in the world.&quot;
From 1984 to 2016, he was the Ernest J. King Professor of Maritime History at the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. He has called maritime history &quot;a subject that touches on both the greatest moments of the human spirit as well as on the worst, including war.&quot;
In 2011, the Naval War College announced the establishment of the Hattendorf Prize for Distinguished Original Research in Maritime History, named for him. The 2014 Oxford Naval Conference - &quot;Strategy and the Sea&quot; - celebrated his distinguished career on April 10–12, 2014. The proceedings of the conference were published as a festschrift. In March 2016, Hattendorf received the higher doctorate of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Oxford. Among the few Americans to have earned this academic degree at Oxford, Hattendorf remained actively engaged on the Naval War College campus after his formal retirement in 2016.

Remaining in scholarly service as the Ernest J. King Professor Emeritus of Maritime History at the Naval War College, Hattendorf continued guiding discussions about the role of history in understanding contemporary strategic problems in the global maritime arena. Recognizing his contributions in the fields of maritime history and naval strategy, the President of the Naval War College, Rear Admiral Jeffrey Harley, established the &quot;John B. Hattendorf Center for Maritime Historical Research&quot; in the summer of 2017. The Hattendorf Historical Center performs the mission of supporting history requirements in Professional Military Education through original documentary research, scholarly publications, public education programming, and direct support to the seagoing forces of the U.S. Navy. The Hattendorf Historical Center also provides historical foundations for contemporary discussion in the interest of facilitating international partnerships in the global maritime commons.
==Family, education, and early life==
Hattendorf was born and raised in the village of Western Springs, Illinois. His interest in the ships and the sea stemmed from summers spent at his family cottage at Portage Point, Michigan, where he was a sailing instructor on Portage Lake from 1958 to 1964. After graduating in the Class of 1960 from Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, Illinois, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1964 from Kenyon College, where he was inspired by Charles Ritcheson and Richard G. Salomon. In 1970, he graduated from the Frank C. Munson Institute of American Maritime History at Mystic Seaport, where he studied under Robert G. Albion and Benjamin W. Labaree. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in history from Brown University in 1971, completing his thesis under the tutelage of A. Hunter Dupree on the history of strategic thinking and wargaming at the Naval War College. In 1979, he completed his doctorate at Pembroke College, Oxford with a thesis on English Grand Strategy in the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702–12, supervised by N. H. Gibbs and complemented by studies under Ragnhild Hatton, Sir Michael Howard and Piers Mackesy.

The actor has commented that while the name &quot;Malina&quot; does not sound Jewish to most people and often leads them to assume he is Latino (often due to confusion with the Spanish surname &quot;Molina&quot;), the name is Czech in origin, from the &quot;Czech [word] for &#x27;raspberry.&#x27;&quot;

Malina attended middle school at Westchester Day School and high school at the Horace Mann School. He earned a B.A. in Theater from Yale University. At Yale, he was a member of The Spizzwinks, an a cappella group, together with fellow actor Noah Emmerich.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Malina made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, and later in the play&#x27;s run moved into a major role. Malina had contacted Sorkin initially at the suggestion of his parents when he first went to New York City, as they knew Sorkin was a high-school classmate and friend of Malina&#x27;s cousins. The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play. 

Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin&#x27;s casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects.

In March 2023, Malina took over the lead role of Hermann Merz in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Leopoldstadt.&quot; In 2024 he performed in London in &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank&quot; at the Marylebone Theatre.

===Film and television===
Malina&#x27;s first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy &quot;Fletch Lives&quot;, an ill-received sequel to Chase&#x27;s hit movie &quot;Fletch.&quot; His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off-screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;The American President&quot;, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening&#x27;s environmental-activist character.

Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real-life magazine &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: &quot;Off Camera&quot;). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart.

From 1998 to 2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;Sports Night&quot;, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. 

The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show&#x27;s troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin&#x27;s time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The actor counts &quot;Sports Night&quot; among his most popular roles and noted on the occasion of the show&#x27;s 10th-anniversary DVD release, &quot;If my straw poll of who stops me to say what is any indication, &quot;West Wing&quot; may only slightly edge &quot;Sports Night&quot;.&quot;

Following the panned Hank Azaria vehicle &quot;Imagine That&quot; – where both he and Azaria were described as &quot;talent going to waste&quot; – Malina played Will Bailey on &quot;The West Wing&quot; from 2002 to 2006. His character initially was perceived by the public as an attempt to replace departing series star Rob Lowe, although Malina said in numerous interviews that the two actors and characters were too dissimilar to be viewed as anything but a change. 

During his tenure on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Malina was known to the rest of the cast as a tireless prankster. It is said he coated telephones with Vaseline and reset producer Alex Graves&#x27;s iPod menus to Mandarin Chinese. He stole some of Bradley Whitford&#x27;s letterhead stationery and used it in an elaborate prank. At the suggestion of co-star Janel Moloney, Malina sent a $200 Valentine&#x27;s Day bouquet to season-six newcomer Jimmy Smits that included a card crafted on Whitford&#x27;s stolen letterhead stating: &quot;Jimmy, You are a delight. I enjoyed every moment we&#x27;ve had together. Be my Valentine.&quot; Partially as a response, Whitford scripted Malina&#x27;s character to say &quot;I can&#x27;t act. I&#x27;m a terrible actor,&quot; when he wrote an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and after the end of the show both have continued to jokingly mock each other on social media and in interviews.

Following the end of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Malina campaigned for the leading role of Danny Tripp in Sorkin&#x27;s next TV project, &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, but the role went instead to Whitford. When the show was cancelled in its first season, Malina was teased by some in the industry who suggested he was Sorkin&#x27;s good luck charm, but he pointed to Sorkin&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; as evidence his friend could succeed without him.

In 2007, Malina became one of the four stars of the short-lived ABC dramedy &quot;Big Shots&quot;. His character, Karl Mixworthy, was a pharmaceutical company executive juggling a wife and a mistress, who meet when the jilted lover tries to expose him to his wife but befriends her instead.

Malina is a co-creator and producer of Bravo&#x27;s cable TV series &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;. In private life, he is an avid poker player, having played with Sorkin while on Broadway, used poker winnings to pay his rent early in his career, and organized a cast-and-crew game that lasted the full duration of &quot;Sports Night&quot; and occasionally delayed the start of shooting. The idea for the show came from a weekly high-stakes poker game hosted by Hank Azaria, which Malina and friend Andrew Hill Newman attended.

From 2011 to 2019, Malina appeared as University President Siebert on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

In 2012, Malina held a recurring role on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Scandal&quot; as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen. He was promoted to a series regular for season 2.

Malina co-hosted the podcast &quot;The West Wing Weekly&quot; with Hrishikesh Hirway. The series debuted in March 2016, and ended in January 2020.

===Philanthropy===
In 2004, Malina was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured &quot;film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community&quot; and included Greg Grunberg, Marlee Matlin, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Malina met costume designer Melissa Merwin through his friendship with her sister Jennifer, and Jennifer&#x27;s then-husband, actor Timothy Busfield. Merwin converted to Judaism under Conservative auspices. They married in 1996 and have two children. Merwin filed for divorce in August 2024, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot;

<text>The United States House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, or Agriculture Committee is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives. The House Committee on Agriculture has general jurisdiction over federal agriculture policy and oversight of some federal agencies, and it can recommend funding appropriations for various governmental agencies, programs, and activities, as defined by House rules.

==History of the committee==
The Agriculture Committee was created on May 3, 1820, after Lewis Williams of North Carolina sponsored a resolution to create the committee and give agricultural issues equal weight with commercial and manufacturing interests. The committee originally consisted of seven members, from the states of Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. Thomas Forrest of Pennsylvania was the first chairman. The Agriculture Committee remained a seven-member body until 1835, when two more members were added. It was not until 1871 that the next two members were added. Since then it has gradually grown to its current size of 46 members.

The U.S. Senate counterpart to the House Agriculture Committee, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, was created on December 9, 1825.

==Role of the committee==
The Agriculture Committee is not generally considered to be a particularly powerful one. However, it is an important committee to be on for Representatives from many rural areas where agriculture is the main industry. The committee has jurisdiction over agriculture, forestry, nutrition, water conservation, and other agriculture-related fields.

===Jurisdiction===

As prescribed by House Rules, the Committee on Agriculture&#x27;s jurisdiction includes the following:
* Adulteration of seeds, insect pests, and protection of birds and animals in forest reserves
* Agriculture generally
* Agricultural and industrial chemistry
* Agricultural colleges and experiment stations
* Agricultural economics and research
* Agricultural education extension services
* Agricultural production, marketing and stabilization of prices of agricultural products, and commodities (excluding foreign distribution)
* Animal industry and diseases of animals
* Commodity exchanges
* Crop insurance and soil conservation
* Dairy industry
* Entomology and plant quarantine
* Extension of farm credit and farm security
* Inspection of livestock, poultry, meat products, and seafood and seafood products
* Forestry in general and forest reserves other than those created from the public domain
* Human nutrition and home economics
* Plant industry, soils, and agricultural engineering
* Rural electrification
* Rural developments
* Water conservation related to activities of the Department of Agriculture

<doc id="989578" wikidata="Q16735110" url="?curid=989578" title="Jack Reimer">
<text>Jack F. Reimer is a Progressive Conservative politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba (MLA) from 1990 to 2007, and served in the government of Gary Filmon.

The son of Jacob Frank Reimer, a Russian immigrant, he grew up in East Kildonan where his father owned a service station and he graduated from Miles MacDonell Collegiate. Reimer has a degree in sociology from the University of North Dakota. Before entering politics, he was a marketing and management instructor for Imperial Oil, and worked in the automobile and tourism industries in Manitoba. He also owned a restaurant and service station. Reimer has received a Mayor&#x27;s Award for Leadership and Service to the Winnipeg community, as well as a Certificate of Merit from the government of Canada.

He married Joan McAdam.

Reimer was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 general election, defeating Liberal candidate Linda Asper in the southeastern Winnipeg riding of Niakwa, 4950 votes to 4301. He was re-elected by a wider margin in 1995, in a period when provincial Liberal fortunes were on the decline (the New Democratic Party (NDP) does not have a strong historical presence in this section of Winnipeg).

On May 9, 1995, Reimer was appointed Minister of Urban Affairs and Minister of Housing in Gary Filmon&#x27;s government. He retained these portfolios until the Progressive Conservative government was defeated in 1999. Reimer himself was easily re-elected in the 1999 election, defeating his NDP opponent by over 2500 votes in the renamed Southdale riding.

In the 2003 election, Reimer was re-elected by 1299 votes over his 26-year-old NDP opponent, Carolyn Frost. He held several critic positions while an opposition MLA.

Reimer opposed efforts by the Manitoba government to provide safe injection paraphernalia to drug addicts, arguing instead for a zero-tolerance policy in such matters. He also criticized the expansion of a casino economy in the province.

He lost his seat to his NDP challenger, former journalist Erin Selby, in the 2007 provincial election.

<text>Floor hockey is a broad term for several indoor floor game codes which involve two teams using a stick and type of ball or disk. Disks are either open or closed but both designs are usually referred to as &quot;pucks&quot;. These games are played either on foot or with wheeled skates. Variants typically reflect the style of ice hockey, field hockey, bandy or some other combination of sport. Games are commonly known by various names including cosom hockey, ball hockey, floorball, or simply floor hockey.

Two floor hockey variants involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as roller sports under the title of roller hockey. Quad hockey uses quad skates, commonly known as roller skates, and appears similar to bandy, while inline hockey uses inline skates and is of the ice hockey variation.

All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball, disk or puck into a goal using sticks, some with a curved end and others a straight, bladeless stick.

Floor hockey games differ from street hockey in that the games are more structured and have a codified set of rules. The variants which do not involve wheeled skates and use a closed puck are sometimes used as a form of dryland training to help teach and train children to play ice hockey while the floorball variant is sometimes used as a dryland training program for bandy.

==History==

Floor hockey was originally a physical fitness sport in many public schools developed for physical education class but has since developed several variants played in a variety of ways and is no longer restricted to educational institutions.

=== Canada ===

Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1875, but the game&#x27;s official creation is credited to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame inductee, Samuel Perry Jacks, better known as &quot;Sam Jacks&quot;. Jacks is the individual who codified floor hockey&#x27;s first set of rules in 1936. However, his version did not involve either a closed disk (puck) or a ball, but an open disk (disk with a hole in the center). At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in Toronto. His achievement was later recognized by the Youth Branch of the United Nations.

In 1947, Sam Jacks became the head coach of the Canadian Floor Hockey Team which competed in the AAU Junior Olympic Games (Amateur Athletic Union) in the USA where the Canadian team finished in third place. It is unclear whether the style of play was the one of his own making or some other format.

In 1991 the Canadian Ball Hockey Association (CBHA) was formed to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey. The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.

=== United States of America ===

In 1947, Canada&#x27;s Sam Jacks was the head coach of the Canadian Floor Hockey Team which travelled from Canada to compete in the AAU Junior Olympic Games in the USA. The Canadians finished in third place. It is unclear if the style of play was the one he codified in 1936 or another variant.

In 1962, one of the first variants of organized indoor hockey games were created in Battle Creek, Michigan in the United States by Tom Harter who used plastic sticks and pucks. It is unclear whether other floor hockey codes using a ball or a felt puck were in existence in the USA at the time or if this marked a new emerging variant in the country.

In 1974, Barbara Walters &amp; Ethel Kennedy played &quot;Sam Jacks&quot; floor hockey (incorrectly labelled &quot;Floor Ringette&quot;) at Margaret Chapman School. A photograph was taken of one of the school&#x27;s students, Maria, stick handling by Ethel Kennedy during the game. The game involved disabled children and was organized by the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation. This was during a period where this particular variant was being changed and adapted from its initial form in order to make it playable for the Special Olympics.

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for a specific intramural floor hockey variant for college campuses across the United States.
=== Special Olympics ===

One version of floor hockey was introduced as a sport in the Winter Special Olympics in 1932.

In 1970, the Special Olympics World Winter Games added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.

In 1974, Barbara Walters &amp; Ethel Kennedy played &quot;Sam Jacks&quot; floor hockey (incorrectly labelled &quot;Floor Ringette&quot;) at Margaret Chapman School. A photograph was taken of one of the school&#x27;s students, Maria, stick handling by Ethel Kennedy during the game. The game involved handicapped children and was organized by the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation. This was during a period where this particular variant was being changed and adapted from its initial form in order to make it playable for the Special Olympics.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs from code to code. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary. It is also important to note that when it comes to equipment, many floor hockey games today use some type of plastic, the first of which wasn&#x27;t invented until 1907 by Leo Baekeland.

=== Object of play ===
Various objects can be used for play depending on the code, but they fall into three main types: a ball, a closed disk called a puck, or an open disk with a hole in the middle. These objects are variously constructed of either plastic or a felt-like material.

=== Sticks ===
Sticks used for play depend on the game codes. Some codes require standard ice hockey, field hockey or bandy sticks, while others use lightweight plastic sticks.

The Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses blade-less wooden sticks.

==== Types of sticks====
The type of floor hockey game that is played and the object of play that is used often determines the type of stick. The material used to make floor hockey sticks varies and can include plastic or some type of composite. Shafts are either rectangular or rounded like in the case of a broomstick.

==== Ball and puck ====
Games which use a ball such as quad hockey will typically use a stick ending in a type of hook though this is not always the case as can be seen in ball hockey and road hockey. Games which use a type of puck (closed disk) such as cosom hockey and inline hockey, will typically use a stick ending in a blade with sharp angle at the end of the shaft with a blade which generally lies flat along the floor.

In the case of floorball the end of the stick involves a design that is a mix between a blade and a hook.

==== Exceptions ====
Three exceptions in regards to sticks can found in floor hockey. These games use either an open disk or a ring.

The first is in the case of Sam Jacks&#x27;s floor hockey, the Canadian variant developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The second one can be found in the Special Olympics which was developed in the 1960s. The third can be found in gym ringette which was developed in the 1990s, but gym ringette itself is not in fact a direct variant of floor hockey and was more heavily influenced by the ice sport of ringette.

In all the first two examples the puck used is in fact an open disk, and is a type of felt disk with a hole in the middle. As a result a straight stick is used as a handle and does not include any type of blade or hook. The end however may include a type of drag-tip. Shafts are either rectangular or round like a broomstick handle.

In the third example, gym ringette uses a plastic shaft with a plastic drag-tip. Gym ringette does not use any type of puck. Instead, gym ringette uses a ring made of a type of rubber foam. The shaft is rectangular in shape.

==Variants==

All floor hockey variants can be separated into four general categories based on four main variables: ball games, puck games (closed disk), disk games (open disk), and a separate category for wheeled skates called &#x27;Roller Games&#x27;. The first three categories are floor hockey variants played on foot while the latter involves the use of wheeled skates. All four categories can have their own sub-divisions to help categorize the existing floor hockey variants even further.

=== Ball games (on foot) ===

==== Ball hockey ====

Ball hockey is an indoor game using a lightweight ball. Outdoor variants exist such as street hockey and dek hockey.

==== Floorball ====

One variation which is especially popular in Europe, is floorball. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

==== Indoor hockey ====

Indoor hockey is an indoor variant of field hockey. Indoor hockey is played on a smaller area and between smaller teams than field hockey and the sidelines are replaced by solid barriers from which the ball rebounds and remains in play.

=== Puck games (on foot) ===

This section refers to floor hockey games using a closed disk often referred to as a &quot;puck&quot;.

==== Cosom hockey ====
Another variation, cosom hockey, uses plastic sticks and pucks.

=== Disk games (on foot) ===

This section refers to floor hockey games using an open disk which is in some cases referred to as a puck and sometimes has been referred to as a ring.

==== Sam Jacks floor hockey ====
&quot;Sam Jacks&quot; floor hockey is an early Canadian design of floor hockey whose rules were created and codified by Canada&#x27;s Sam Jacks in 1936. It is sometimes mistaken for ringette or gym ringette. The game uses straight, bladeless sticks and a disk made of felt with a hole in the middle. Several public schools in Canada used the game in physical education and gym classes, but the game is far less commonly played today.

Jacks would later create the ice team skating sport of ringette in Canada in 1963. Today ringette only loosely resembles floor hockey, with ringette having been influenced variously by rules in from basketball, ice hockey, and broomball when its first rules were designed. Though ringette&#x27;s first experimental ring was a felt floor hockey puck (sometimes referred to as a &quot;ring&quot;) it was quickly replaced by deck tennis rings due to the felt puck accumulating snow and sticking to the ice.

==== Special Olympics ====
The Special Olympics variant of floor hockey uses a wide disc with a hole in the middle and a blade-less stick. Floor hockey pucks are donut shaped felt pucks with a center hole of 10 cm (4 inches), a diameter of 20 cm (8 inches), a thickness of 2.5 cm (1inch) and a weight of 140 to 225 grams (5 to 8 ounces).
Protective equipment is required. It is believed to have been derived from a much earlier floor hockey variant from early 20th century Canada whose rules were codified by Sam Jacks.

=== Roller games (wheeled skates) ===
There are two variants of floor hockey which use wheeled skates: quad hockey which is also known by other names like rink hockey, a sport with a resemblance more reminiscent of bandy and field hockey, and in-line hockey which is a wheeled variant of ice hockey.

==== Quad hockey ====

Quad hockey is a wheeled floor hockey variant also known by various names including roller hockey and rink hockey.

==== In-line hockey ====

In-line hockey is a wheeled floor hockey variant derived from the ice sport of ice hockey.

=== Gym Ringette ===

Gym ringette is the off-ice variant of the winter team skating sport of ringette and today is only distantly related to floor hockey. While the sport of ringette was initially influenced by the rules of basketball, ice hockey, broomball, and a variety of floor hockey games played during the early part of the 20th century, particularly the floor hockey style codified by Sam Jacks, gym ringette was developed in Canada near the end of the 20th century and was designed as an off-ice variant of the ice game of ringette rather than floor hockey.

== Rules ==

Although there are different codes of floor hockey rules, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code, with the exception of gym ringette.

=== Start of play ===

Floor hockey games start with a face-off, in which a player from each team has an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

=== Scoring ===

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into golden goal period(s) in order to determine a winner. Overtime rules vary, but typically include extra time and/or penalty shootout.

=== Penalties ===

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced. A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a power play, but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
* Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
* Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player&#x27;s forward progress by pulling him or her back
* Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player&#x27;s body
* Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
* High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
* Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
* Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind
* Cross-checking – ramming opponent with stick using both hands
* Too many players on court - to be served by designated player
* Spearing – stabbing opponent with stick blade (game misconduct)
* Deliberate intent to injure opponents (game misconduct)
Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games, although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

== Common misconceptions ==

The term &quot;floor hockey&quot; has at times been incorrectly called ringette and vice versa. Ringette is not a floor sport, but an ice skating sport. Another common mistake is to confuse gym ringette with floor hockey. Though one of the two floor hockey variants which use a disc with a hole in the center was codified by the Canadian Sam Jacks in the 1930s, gym ringette should not be confused with floor hockey variants due to the fact gym ringette was designed in Canada in the late 20th century as the off-ice variant of the ice skating sport of ringette, a sport which was also created by Sam Jacks in Canada in the 1960s.

<text>The folkloric traditional music of Paraguay is the Paraguayan polka and the [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. The Paraguayan polka comes from polka of Czech origin; that was danced for the first time in Asunción, on November 27, 1858. The guarania was created by the Paraguayan musician José Asunción Flores, in January 1925, after experiencing different arrangements with the old Paraguayan musical theme &quot;Ma&#x27;erãpa reikuaase&quot;. Paraguay also has classical music and popular music consisting of rock and jazz music. The folk music uses a range of different instruments some of which include the Spanish guitar and the European harp. 

==Overview==
The polka presents numerous variations on a similar rhythmic pattern, which are known as: Polka song, Galopa, Polka valseada, Polka popó, Polka jekutu, Polka kyre&#x27;y, Polka syryry, Purahéi jahe&#x27;o, Kyre&#x27;y, Chamamé, among other. Another rhythm created by the fusion of rhythms is called &quot;Avanzada&quot;, which in 1977 was elaborated by the Paraguayan musician Oscar Nelson Safuán.

The modern rhythms reached Paraguay in the 50s, with the importation of electronic instruments that began to use dance orchestras. Mainly in the 1970s, latin music, rock music, pop, dance, protest song, cumbia, among others, were developed. Currently there is also a growing scene of latin music, folklore, hiphop, blues music, jazz, rock, electronic music, ethnic, reggae, and other genres.

The Paraguayan polka combines ternary and binary rhythms, where as the European only uses binary. The most famous style of music is Guarania, created by the Paraguayan musician José Asunción Flores in 1926. The Guarania accomplishes this by using a combination of slow rhythms and melodies of melancholia character. Other popular genres of traditional music in Paraguay are the zarzuela and the &quot;Paraguayan Songs&quot;, which are derived from the Paraguayan polka. Examples of Paraguayan Guarania are Juan B. Mora – &quot;Imposible&quot;, Duo Ñamandu – &quot;Che Rope&#x27;a Vype&quot;, Lorenzo Perez – &quot;Mi Dicha Lejana&quot;, Los Indianos – &quot;Mis Noches Sin Ti&quot; and others. The greatest influence outside Paraguay was Luís Alberto del Paraná y su Trío Los Paraguayos. There was a time in the 1950s when most of the LP&#x27;s of Latin American music in the shops in London were by that group. The guaranía mentioned above is a slow-to-medium style. The more lively music is called &quot;polka paraguaya&quot;. Both styles are based on the 6/8 rhythm. Paraguayan songs tend to be sung in Guaraní or a mixture of Guaraní and Spanish. Music of a strongly Paraguayan character is also heard in the Argentine provinces of Misiones, Formosa and Corrientes, across the River Paraná from Paraguay itself. Drag artist Usha Didi Gunatita used popular music in her early performances at bars such as Stop, Trauma or Playboy.

===Instruments===
The Spanish guitar (not from Paraguay) and European harp are among the most popular instruments, while dances include the lively polka and distinctive bottle dance, which involves the performer twirling a bottle around her head. Composer and guitarist Agustín Barrios is perhaps the country&#x27;s best known export.

===Paraguayan harp===
The Paraguayan harp deserves special mention as a popular instrument with a national style associated with it. The harp in South America dates back to at least 1556–1557, possibly as early as the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced to Paraguay by Jesuit priests who came to evangelise (the native population of indigenous Guaranis) and founded many missions, called &quot;reducciones&quot; . It was frequently used in church music in place of the organ or harpsichord. The Paraguayan harp is the national instrument of Paraguay, its shape and size were consolidated in the early 20th century by interpreter and composer Felix Perez Cardozo, who composed some of the most memorable pieces for the Paraguayan harp. It stands about 1.5 metres (5 ft) high and is very light and portable. The sound box is made of cedro (a type of mahogany) and pine. 

However, more recently, harps have begun to be constructed with the addition of levers to overcome this limitation, and many players are now using levered harps.

==Popular music==
===Rock===
Rock is a popular genre in the Paraguayan music scene. Former President Alfredo Stroessner established a dictatorship and oppressed freedom of expression during his term between 1954 and 1989. But rock band Aftermad&#x27;s and Los Blue Caps were formed during this time from late 1960s to 1970s. The end of the dictatorship of Stroessner in 1989, a new rock scene started. New rock bands such as Flou (alt rock), Revolver (alt rock), Ripe Banana Skins (punk), Area 69, Paiko, The Force (slash metal) were formed. 21st century Paraguayan rock scene is supported by rock festivals such as &quot;Pilsen Rock&quot; and &quot;Quilmes Rock&quot;.

===Jazz===
There is a small but vibrant jazz community in Paraguay. Jazz Day festival was opened in Paraguay. Key players and group include: CCPA Jazz Quintet, Palito Miranda (alto sax), Remigio Pereira (trombone), Victor &quot;Toti&quot; Morel (drums), Oswal Gonzalez (drums), Riolo Alvarenga (drums), Jorge &quot;Lobito&quot; Martinez (piano), Carlos Schvartzman (guitar), Carlos Centurión (piano), Gustavo Viera (guitar), Eduardo &quot;Tato&quot; Zilli (bass), Nene Salerno (bass), Ariel Burgos (bass), Victor Morel Jr. (drums), German Lema (organ), Jose Villamayor (guitar), Bruno Muñoz (tenor and alto saxophone) and others.

==Classical music==
The main exponents are Agustín Barrios Mangoré, José Asunción Flores, Berta Rojas and Juan Carlos Moreno. Silva studied abroad and reproduced, in the guarani vocal form, the indigenous music, based on the European technique. Moreno composed works inspired on popular themes in a romantic classical path.

<text>Proinsias De Rossa (born 15 May 1940) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Social Welfare from 1994 to 1997, leader of Democratic Left from 1992 to 1999 and leader of the Workers&#x27; Party from 1988 to 1992. He served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 1989 to 1992 and 1999 to 2012. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin North-West from 1982 to 2002.

==Early life and political activity==
Born as Francis Ross in 1940 in Dublin, he was educated at Marlborough Street National School and Dublin Institute of Technology. He joined Fianna Éireann at age 12.

In May 1956, soon after his sixteenth birthday, he joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and was politically active in Sinn Féin from an early age. During the IRA border campaign, he was arrested while training other IRA members in Glencree in May 1957. He served seven months in Mountjoy Prison and was then interned at the Curragh Camp.

==Political activities and career==
He took the Official Sinn Féin side in the 1970 split. In 1977, he contested his first general election for the party, which that year was renamed Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party (in 1982 the name changed again to the Workers&#x27; Party).

He was successful on his third attempt, and was elected at the February 1982 general election as a Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party TD for the Dublin North-West constituency. He retained his seat until the 2002 general election when he stood down in order to devote more time to his work in the European Parliament.

In 1988, De Rossa succeeded Tomás Mac Giolla as president of the Workers&#x27; Party. The party had been growing steadily in the 1980s, and had its best-ever electoral performance in the general and European elections held in 1989. The party won 7 Dáil seats with 5% of the vote. De Rossa himself was elected to the European Parliament for the Dublin constituency, where he topped the poll and the party almost succeeded in replacing Fine Gael as the capital&#x27;s second-largest party. He sat as a member of the Group for the European United Left. However, the campaign resulted in a serious build-up of financial debt by the Workers&#x27; Party, which threatened to greatly inhibit the party&#x27;s ability to ensure it would hold on to its gains.

Long-standing tensions within the Workers&#x27; Party, pitting reformers, including most of the party&#x27;s TDs, against hard-liners centred on former general secretary Seán Garland, came to a head in 1992. Disagreements on policy issues were exacerbated by the desire of the reformers to ditch the democratic centralist nature of the party structures, and to remove any remaining questions about alleged party links with the Official IRA, a topic which had been the subject of persistent and embarrassing media coverage. De Rossa called a Special Ardfheis (party conference) to debate changes to the constitution. The motion failed to get the required two-thirds majority, and subsequently De Rossa led the majority of the parliamentary group and councillors out of a meeting of the party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee the following Saturday at Wynn&#x27;s Hotel, splitting the party.

De Rossa and the other former Workers&#x27; Party members then established a new political party, provisionally called New Agenda. At its founding conference in March 1992, it was named Democratic Left and De Rossa was elected party leader. Later that year he resigned his European Parliament seat, where he was succeeded by Democratic Left general secretary Des Geraghty.

Following the collapse of the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government in 1994, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left negotiated a government programme for the remaining life of the 27th Dáil, which became known as the Rainbow Coalition. De Rossa became Minister for Social Welfare. He initiated Ireland&#x27;s first national anti-poverty strategy, a commission on the family, and a commission to examine national pension policy.

Also under De Rossa, taxes on unemployment benefits were abolished, while the level of unemployment assistance for those living in the family home was increased substantially. A One Parent Family Allowance was also introduced, along with a Disability Allowance, Adoptive Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit and Survivor&#x27;s Pension.
The 1997 general election resulted in the defeat of the outgoing coalition. At this point, Democratic Left had accumulated a very significant financial debt. In light of the co-operation achieved in practically all policy areas during the Rainbow Coalition, the party decided to merge with the Labour Party. Labour leader Ruairi Quinn continued as leader of the unified party; De Rossa took up the symbolic post of party president, which he held until 2002.

In 1999, De Rossa was elected again at the European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency, sitting on this occasion with the Group of the Party of European Socialists. De Rossa did not contest his Dáil seat at the 2002 general election. He was re-elected at the 2004 European Parliament election. As a member of the European Parliament, De Rossa took a strong pro-integration approach from a distinctly social democratic perspective, as well as a keen interest in foreign policy and social policy.

De Rossa was a member of the European Convention which produced the July 2003 draft European Constitution. De Rossa was chair of the European Parliament&#x27;s delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council. He was a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Conference of Delegation Chairs, and a substitute member of the Committee on Development and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. On 16 January 2012, he announced his decision to resign as an MEP, and stepped down on 1 February.

==Libel action==
During De Rossa&#x27;s period as leader of Democratic Left, Irish journalist Eamon Dunphy, writing in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; newspaper, published an article alleging that De Rossa was aware, while a member of the Workers&#x27; Party, of the Official IRA&#x27;s alleged illegal activities, including bank robberies and forgery. De Rossa sued the newspaper for libel and was awarded IR£300,000.

<text>Game Players was a monthly video game magazine founded by Robert C. Lock in 1989 and originally published by Signal Research in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The original publication began as Game Players Strategy to Nintendo Games (the cover featured a disclaimer that claimed it had no affiliation with Nintendo, which already had its official publication in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;). The magazine evolved over the years, spinning off a separate publication called Game Players Sega Genesis Guide when Sega entered the console market. These two magazines were later folded together into one magazine.

In 1996, the magazine changed its name to Ultra Game Players and introduced a radically different format. At the end of its run, it turned into Game Buyer, before being cancelled in 1998.

==History==
Around 1992, Signal Research was shut down by investors that seized the company because of fiscal mismanagement. The publishing house was revived by an investment group as GP Publications, with the intention of being sold. About a year later, GP Publications was purchased by Future Publishing UK (mainly for &quot;Game Players&quot;) as an entry into the North American media publishing field. The newly acquired publication (along with &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, that was also published by GP Publications) was then used as a foundation to start a for a new American publishing company operated under the name of Imagine Media.

&quot;Games Players&quot; is the first video game magazine to feature a computer generated or CG cover. The magazine also featured mini-strategy guides, paper toys, trading cards and other branded items and extras, like posters for games, that were included when the issue was polybagged.

During 1989 and 1990, the company also put out a total of 16 &quot;GameTapes&quot;, which were VHS tapes that showed how to beat certain NES games.

Humor is included in almost every videogame review and image caption. Readers&#x27; letters come at the beginning of the magazine and are often one of the highlights of the magazine. The magazine often includes a &quot;newsletter&quot; with irreverent jokes about magazine staffers, as well as cartoons. The introduction of &quot;Ultra Game Players&quot; was intended to coincide with the release of the Nintendo 64 and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, as originally, the Nintendo 64 went by the name Nintendo Ultra 64.

&quot;Ultra Game Players&quot; features an updated design which places the readers&#x27; letters at the end of the magazine. One of the features of &quot;Ultra Game Players&quot; is a &quot;prize store&quot; in which readers answered trivia questions for chances to win prizes. However, many readers complained that the humor that had made &quot;Game Players&quot; such an enjoyable magazine was missing from the &quot;Ultra&quot; version, which prompted a return to form soon after the switch.

<text>Long-track speed skating, usually simply referred to as speed skating, is the Olympic discipline of speed skating where competitors are timed while crossing a set distance. It is also a sport for leisure. Sports such as ice skating marathon, short-track speedskating, inline speedskating, and quad speed skating are also called speed skating.

Long-track speed skating enjoys large popularity in the Netherlands and has also had champion athletes from Austria, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Japan, Italy, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Russia, Sweden, the Czech Republic and the United States. Speed skaters attain maximum speeds of .

== History ==

===ISU development===

The roots of speed skating date back over a millennium to Scandinavia, Northern Europe and the Netherlands, where the natives added bones to their shoes and used them to travel on frozen rivers, canals and lakes. In contrast to what people think, ice skating has always been an activity of joy and sports and not a matter of transport. For example, winters in the Netherlands have never been stable and cold enough to make ice skating a way of travelling or a mode of transport. This has already been described in 1194 by William Fitzstephen, who described a sport in London.

Later, in Norway, King Eystein Magnusson, later King Eystein I of Norway, boasts of his skills racing on ice legs.

However, skating and speed skating was not limited to the Netherlands and Scandinavia; in 1592, a Scotsman designed a skate with an iron blade. It was iron-bladed skates that led to the spread of skating and, in particular, speed skating. By 1642, the first official skating club, The Skating Club Of Edinburgh, was born, and, in 1763, the world saw its first official speed skating race, at Wisbech on the Fens in England for a prize sum of 70 guineas. While in the Netherlands, people began touring the waterways connecting the 11 cities of Friesland, a challenge which eventually led to the Elfstedentocht.

By 1851, North Americans had discovered a love of the sport, and indeed the all-steel blade was later developed there. The Netherlands came back to the fore in 1889 with the organization of the first world championships. The ISU (International Skating Union) was also born in the Netherlands in 1892. By the start of the 20th century, skating and speed skating had come into its own as a major popular sporting activity.

===Elfstedentocht and Dutch history===

The Elfstedentocht (Eleven Cities Tour) was organised as a competition in 1909 and has been held at irregular intervals whenever the ice on the course is deemed good enough. Other outdoor races developed later, with North Holland hosting a race in 1917, but the Dutch natural ice conditions have rarely been conducive to skating. The Elfstedentocht has been held 15 times since 1909, and, before artificial ice was available in 1962, national championships had been held in 25 of the years between 1887, when the first championship was held in Slikkerveer, and 1961. Since artificial ice became common in the Netherlands, Dutch speed skaters have been among the top long-track speed skaters and marathon skaters in the world.

Another solution to still be able to skate marathons on natural ice became the Alternative Elfstedentocht. The Alternative Elfstedentocht races take part in other countries, such as Austria, Finland or Canada, and all top marathon skaters as well as thousands of recreative skaters travel from the Netherlands to the location where the race is held. According to the NRC Handelsblad journalist Jaap Bloembergen, the country &quot;takes a carnival look&quot; during international skating championships, despite the fact that &quot;people outside the country are not particularly interested.&quot;

===Olympic Games===

At the 1914 Olympic Congress, the delegates agreed to include long-track speed skating in the 1916 Olympics, after figure skating had featured in the 1908 Olympics. However, World War I put an end to the plans of Olympic competition, and it was not until the winter sports week in Chamonix in 1924—retroactively awarded Olympic status—that ice speed skating reached the Olympic programme. Charles Jewtraw from Lake Placid, New York, won the first Olympic gold medal, though several Norwegians in attendance claimed Oskar Olsen had clocked a better time. Timing issues on the 500 m were a problem within the sport until electronic clocks arrived in the 1960s; during the 1936 Olympic 500-metre race, it was suggested that Ivar Ballangrud&#x27;s 500-metre time was almost a second too good. Finland won the remaining four gold medals at the 1924 Games, with Clas Thunberg winning 1,500 metres, 5,000 metres, and allround. It was the only time an allround Olympic gold medal has been awarded in speed skating.

Norwegian and Finnish skaters won all the gold medals in World Championships between the world wars, with Latvians and Austrians visiting the podium in the European Championships. At the time, North American races were usually conducted pack-style, similar to the marathon races in the Netherlands, but the Olympic races were to be held over the four ISU-approved distances. The ISU approved the suggestion that the 1932 Olympic speed skating competitions should be held as pack-style races, and Americans won all four gold medals. Canada won five medals, all silver and bronze, while defending World Champion Clas Thunberg stayed at home, protesting against this form of racing. At the World Championships held immediately after the Games, without the American champions, Norwegian racers won all four distances and occupied the top three spots in the allround standings.

Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish and Japanese skating leaders protested to the USOC, condemning the manner of competition, and expressing the wish that mass start races were never to be held again at the Olympics. However, ISU adopted the short-track speed skating branch, with mass start races on shorter tracks, in 1967, arranged international competitions from 1976, and brought them back to the Olympics in 1992.

===Women&#x27;s competitions===

In the 1930s, women began to be accepted in ISU speed skating competitions. Although women&#x27;s races had been held in North America for some time and competed at the 1932 Winter Olympics in a demonstration event, the ISU did not organise official competitions until 1936. However, Zofia Nehringowa set the first official world record in 1929. Women&#x27;s speed skating was not very high-profile; in &quot;Skøytesportens stjerner&quot; (Stars of the skating sport), a Norwegian work from 1971, no female skaters are mentioned on the book&#x27;s nearly 200 pages, though they had by then competed for nearly 30 years. The women&#x27;s long-track speed skating was since dominated by East Germany and later reunified Germany, who have won 15 of 35 Olympic gold medals in women&#x27;s long-track since 1984.

===Technical developments===

Artificial ice entered the long-track competitions with the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the competitions in 1956 on Lake Misurina were the last Olympic competitions on natural ice. 1960 also saw the first Winter Olympic competitions for women. Lidia Skoblikova won two gold medals in 1960 and four in 1964.

More aerodynamic skating suits were also developed, with Swiss skater Franz Krienbühl (who finished 8th on the Olympic 10,000 m at the age of 46) at the front of development. After a while, national teams took over development of &quot;body suits&quot;. Suits and indoor skating, as well as the clap skate, has helped to lower long-track world records considerably; from 1971 to 2007, the average speed on the men&#x27;s 1500 metres was raised from . Similar speed increases are shown in the other distances.

===Professionalism===

After the 1972 season, European long-track skaters founded a professional league, International Speedskating League, which included Ard Schenk, three-time Olympic gold medallist in 1972, as well as five Norwegians, four other Dutchmen, three Swedes, and a few other skaters. Jonny Nilsson, 1963 world champion and Olympic gold medallist, was the driving force behind the league, which folded in 1974 for economic reasons, and ISU also excluded tracks hosting professional races from future international championships. The ISU later organised its own World Cup circuit with monetary prizes, and full-time professional teams developed in the Netherlands during the 1990s, which led them to a dominance on the men&#x27;s side only challenged by Japanese 500 m racers and a couple of American allrounders.

==Racing==

All races are held in pairs, (except for the new Mass Start event), for which two lanes on the track are used. Skaters wear bands around their upper arm to identify which lane they started in. The colours are white for inner lane and red for outer lane. At the back straight, the skaters switch lanes, which causes them both to cover the same distance per lap. When both skaters emerge from the corner at exactly the same time, the person currently in the inner lane will have to let the outer lane pass in front of him. This usually does not cause any problems, as the person in the inner lane will generally move much faster than the person in the outer lane.

Occasionally, quartet starts are used, for the pragmatic and practical reason of allowing more skaters to complete their races inside a given amount of time. This involves having two pairs of skaters in the lanes at the same time, but with the second pair starting when the first have completed approximately half of the first lap. The skaters in the second pair will then wear yellow and blue arm bands instead of the usual white and red.

==Rink==
Skaters race on a two-lane oval rink similar in dimension to an outdoor athletics track. Indeed, an athletics track covered with ice can function as a speed skating track, such as on Bislett stadion in Oslo up to the 1980s. According to the rules of the International Skating Union, a standard track should be either 400 m or 333⅓ m long; 400 m is the standard used for all major competitions. Tracks of other, non-standard lengths, such 200 or 250 m, are also in use in some places for training and/or smaller local competitions. On standard tracks, the curves have a radius of 25–26 m in the inner lane, and each lane is 3–4 m wide.

===Top international rinks===

These rinks have hosted international events (World Cups or international senior championships) since 2005.

====Indoor====

*Gunda-Niemann-Stirnemann-Halle, Erfurt, Germany
*Heilongjiang Indoor Rink, Harbin, China
*Jilin Provincial Speed Skating Rink, Changchun, China
*Kometa Ice Rink, Kolomna, Russia
*Ice Palace Krylatskoye, Moscow, Russia
*M-Wave, Nagano, Japan
*Ludwig Schwabl Stadion, Inzell, Germany
*Oval Lingotto, Turin, Italy
*Olympic Oval, Calgary, Alberta, Canada
*Pettit National Ice Center, West Allis, Wisconsin, United States
*Richmond Olympic Oval, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada
*Sportforum Hohenschönhausen, Berlin, Germany
*Thialf, Heerenveen, Netherlands
*Utah Olympic Oval, Kearns, Utah, United States
*Vikingskipet, Hamar, Norway
*Alau Ice Palace, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan
*Centre de glaces, Québec City, Québec, Canada

Of these, the rinks in Calgary (~1100 meters above sea level) and Kearns (Salt Lake City) (1402 m) are located at a high altitude, which is believed to enable faster times than lowland rinks, due to decreased air resistance, and also due to there being less oxygen to create bubbles in the ice. The high altitude is believed to be part of the reason that the 2002 Salt Lake City games broke most of the previous speed-skating Olympic records.

After the completion of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the Richmond Olympic oval &quot;will shed its long-track speed skating configuration for a multi-sport layout that will accommodate ice, track, court, paddling and fitness users&quot;.

====Outdoor====
* Cuddy Family Midtown Park, Anchorage, AK, USA

* Ritten Kunsteisbahn, Klobenstein–Collalbo, Italy
* High-altitude skating rink Medeo, Kazakhstan
*Ice rink COS OPO Zakopane, Poland

All four of these are high-altitude rinks.

====Combination with other sports====

Many speed skating venues have ice hockey rinks or no ice area at all inside the oval. A few are suitable also for bandy, like Hamar Olympic Hall, Ice Palace Krylatskoye, and Medeu. Beijing National Speed Skating Oval in Beijing, China, which was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, is also designed appropriately for that sport. There is a growing cooperation between International Skating Union and Federation of International Bandy, since both have an interest in more indoor venues with large ice surfaces being built. In Norway there is an agreement in place, stating that an indoor arena intended primarily for either bandy or long-track speed skating, shall have ice surface for the other sport as well.

== Equipment ==

There are two primary types of skates, traditional ice skates and clap skates. The clap skates were introduced by Viking around 1996. They were considered revolutionary as the blades are hinged at the front of the boot and detach at the heel, allowing the skater a more natural range of movement. This enables a longer stroke while keeping maximum contact with the ice. By the 1998 Winter Olympics, nearly all skaters used clap skates.

Both traditional and clap skates use long and straight blades compared to many other ice skating sports. Blades are about 1 mm thick and typically come in lengths from . Most competitive athletes use lengths between , depending on body size and personal preference. The Viking skating factory in Holland still counts as the world&#x27;s biggest producer of clap skates.

A lot of attention is given to air resistance. The rules demand that the suits follow the natural shape of the body, preventing the use of, e.g., drop shaped helmets (as seen in cycling) or more inventive &quot;Donald Duck&quot; costumes. However, a lot of time and money is spent developing fabrics, cuts and seams that will reduce drag. Some skaters use low (no thicker than 3 mm) &quot;aerodynamic strips&quot; attached to their suits. These are intended to create turbulent flow in certain areas around the body.

Glasses or goggles may also be worn so that the wind does not dry out the eyes.

== Competition format ==
===Allround===

The oldest competition format still in place is the allround event, standardized in 1892 (see History above). Skaters skate four distances (for men: 500 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, and 10,000 m), and a ranking is made up based on the times skated on all of these distances. The method of scoring is the same for all combinations. All times are calculated back to 500 m times, so skating the 500 m in 40 seconds gives 40 points, while 1500 m (3×500 m) in 2 minutes (120 seconds, equivalent to 3×40 s) also gives 40 points. Points are calculated to three decimal places, and truncation is applied; the numbers are not rounded. The skater who has the fewest points wins the competition. This system is called samalog. An allround champion may not have won a single distance—such as Viktor Kosichkin in the 1962 World Championship—or he may win three distances but lose the overall title. Originally, three distance victories won one the championship, but the rules were changed after Rolf Falk-Larssen beat Tomas Gustafson at the 1983 World Championship despite the latter having less points. The ISU organizes an annual World Allround Speed Skating Championships.

=== Sprint championships ===

The sprint championships are two-day events where skaters run the 500 m and 1000 m on both days. The samalog system is again applied to crown the winner. To counter any systematic bias regarding inner versus outer lanes, skaters change start lanes from the first day to the second. Nations with active skaters arrange annual national sprint championships, and the ISU have held annual World Sprint Speedskating Championships for men and for women since 1970. Since 2017 a biannual European Allround Speedskating Championships is held which includes a sprint championship.

=== Single distances ===

A more basic form of speed skating consists of skating a single event. This is the format used for the World Single Distance Championships, which have been arranged since 1996, and the World Cup. The usual distances are the 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 3000 m (women only), 5000 m and 10,000 m (men only), but some other distances are sometimes skated as well, such as 100 m and 1 mile. Women occasionally, but rarely, are given the opportunity to skate the 10,000 m, but outside the top-level championships.

The 500 m is usually skated with two runs, so that every skater has one race starting in the outer lane and one in the inner. This practice started with the first of the World Single Distance Championships in 1996, and with the 1998 Nagano Olympics; at all earlier Olympics, the 500 m was skated only once. The reason for skating this distance twice is that there is a small but statistically significant average advantage of starting in the inner lane; negotiating the last curve at high speed is typically more difficult in the inner lane than in the outer lane.

In addition to international championships, the International Skating Union has organised the Speed Skating World Cup since the 1985–86 season. The World Cup works by ranking skaters by cumulative score during the season, for each distance separately, at specially designated World Cup meets. More specifically, there is for each season a World Cup competition for the 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, and combined 5,000 m and 10,000 m, for men; and for the 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, and combined 3,000 m and 5,000 m, for women.

Starting with the 2011/2012 season the ISU decided to crown one &quot;Grand World Cup Winner&quot; for Men and Ladies as the aggregate of all the scores during the World Cup Season.

===Team pursuit===
The team pursuit is a team event in speed skating and is skated by teams of three skaters. Races resemble the team pursuit event in track cycling. Two teams race at a time, starting at a line in the middle of the straightaway. One team starts on each side of the track. Only the inner lane is used. The distance is eight laps for men and six for women. The team&#x27;s time is the third skater to cross the finish line.

There are several formats for the team pursuit. The Olympic format is unusual in that it is a cup format, with several rounds of exclusion between two teams. In the World Cup and World Championships, one race is skated and the teams are ranked by their finishing time. In the Olympic format, a team that overtakes the other has automatically won the race and the remaining distance is not skated. In practice, the distance is so short that this rarely happens unless one team has a fall.

The team pursuit is a new event in major international competitions. The event was introduced at international level at the world junior championships around the turn of the millennium, and to the World Cup in 2003, but it was not considered an official ISU event until around 2004, and eventually introduced at the Olympics in 2006.

=== Marathon ===
In marathon events, skaters skate long distances in a large group. When conducted at an ice rink oval, the distance is usually around 40 km, akin to the traditional marathon in running. When skated outdoors on natural ice, the distances can be as long as 200 km. An example of this is the famous Elfstedentocht (Eleven cities tour), which is irregularly held in the Netherlands. Alternative versions of this famous event are sometimes held abroad, e.g., in Finland and Canada.

In cold winters in the Netherlands, a &quot;National championship&quot; skating marathon on natural ice is organized if it meets the minimum requirement of 12-centimetre thickness. For the first time in 13 years, a Dutch championship ice-skating marathon on natural ice was held in January 2009, in the Oostvaardersplassen wetland near Lelystad in the province of Flevoland, an area of land reclaimed in the 1960s. The women competitors competed in 60 kilometres, and the men, 100 kilometres.

An example of a famous marathon outside the Netherlands is the International Big Rideau Lake Speed Skating Marathon in Portland, Ontario, Canada.

==Notable skaters==

The following is the list of athletes who have won the following competitions at least five times in individual events.
*Olympic Winter Games
*World All-Round Speed Skating Championships
*World Sprint Speed Skating Championships
As its inclusion would place the athletes who have been active before 1996 at a significant disadvantage, World Single Distance Championships are not included as a primary component of the list, though individual achievements in that competition are noted when applicable. The team pursuit, introduced at the 2006 Olympics and the 2005 World Single Distance Championships, has been left out for a more balanced comparison and to focus on individual achievements.

<text>For Hope is a 1996 American made-for-television drama film starring Dana Delany and directed by Bob Saget. Based on Saget&#x27;s sister Gay, the movie showed the experience of a young woman fatally afflicted with the disease scleroderma. Other cast members included Tracy Nelson and Chris Demetral. The film premiered on November 17, 1996 on ABC.

Dana Delany had to have some significant prosthetic makeup applied to simulate the various degrees of disfigurement the main character, Hope, experienced as a result of the disease.

The original airing achieved the top Nielsen ratings for the time slot. The movie has periodically been rerun on various TV networks and is available on DVD and VHS for a $20 donation at the Scleroderma Research Foundation.

An extra feature of the movie was that it included a cameo appearance by Scleroderma Research Foundation founder Sharon Monsky.

<text>Regional tartans of Canada are represented by all Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories having a regional tartan, as do many other regional divisions in Canada. Tartans were first brought to Canada by Scottish settlers; the first province to adopt one officially was Nova Scotia in 1956 (when registered at the Court of the Lord Lyon; adopted by law in 1963), and the most recent province was Ontario, in 2000. Except for the tartan of Quebec, all of the provincial and territorial tartans are officially recognized and registered in the books of the Court of the Lord Lyon, King of Arms of Scotland.

==Maple Leaf tartan==
The official tartan for Canada as a whole is known as the &quot;Maple Leaf tartan&quot; and became an official national symbol in 2011. The maple leaf tartan was designed in 1964 by David Weiser to commemorate the new Canadian flag. The four colours reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling. The Maple Leaf tartan is used by the Royal Canadian Regiment Pipes and Drums, and has been worn by the second, third and fourth Battalions.

<doc id="989659" wikidata="Q7293657" url="?curid=989659" title="Rao's">
<text>Rao&#x27;s () is an Italian-American restaurant founded in 1896. It is located at 455 East 114th Street, on the corner of Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem (or Italian Harlem), New York City. Rao&#x27;s has a sister restaurant in Los Angeles.

==History==
The restaurant was started in 1896 by Joshua Anthony Rao, who moved with his parents from Italy to the United States. He bought a small shop in Italian Harlem, once a very large Italian-American community, and ran the restaurant until his death in 1909. Louis Rao took over the business. Seen by many as a very suave man, he had his hair cut at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and wore many fancy suits.
Rao&#x27;s now sells products in gourmet markets and supermarkets. Products include pasta, sauces, as well as olive oil.

Though small, Italian Harlem culture is still kept alive by Rao&#x27;s and the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Every year on the second weekend of August in honor of Back To School, the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the &quot;Dancing of the Giglio&quot; is performed while thousands of visitors and onlookers celebrate the once largest Italian community in New York City.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; describes the restaurant as &quot;one of the hardest places to get into in the city&quot;. Notable patrons of the eatery have included John Gotti, Rudy Giuliani, Robert De Niro, and others like Bo Dietl.

=== Other locations ===
In December 2006, Rao&#x27;s opened a second restaurant in Las Vegas at Caesar&#x27;s Palace, under executive chef Carla Pellegrino, with two ten-table rooms and additional seating available on an outdoor garden patio. In early 2009, Rao&#x27;s in Las Vegas opened a bocce bar outside and began offering bocce lessons and cocktails there. The Las Vegas location closed in 2021.

In July 2013, Frank Pellegrino Jr. announced on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; that Rao&#x27;s would open in Hollywood soon. It has since been opened in Hollywood.

==In media==

===Film===
In the movie &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, which premiered in December 2013, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is seen eating dinner in Rao&#x27;s restaurant during a meeting with private investigator Bo Dietl.

Woody Allen and Mia Farrow regularly ate at Rao&#x27;s in the 1980s. Mrs. Rao inspired the character Tina Vitale in his 1984 film &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;.

Jars of sauce can be seen in the grocery store scene in the movie &quot;Christmas With The Kranks&quot;.

===Music===
In 2009, Jay-Z shot the music video for &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (Death of Autotune) at Rao&#x27;s.

===Television===
Rao&#x27;s was the basis for &quot;Raimondo&#x27;s,&quot; a fictional restaurant featured as the site of a murder in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Everybody Loves Raimondo&#x27;s.&quot; The owner of the fictional restaurant was played by actor Ray Abruzzo, who later co-starred with Pellegrino on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The episode was based on a shooting at the restaurant in 2003.

On &quot;Top Chef: All Stars&quot;, season 8, episode 8, an elimination challenge required the chefs to cook a three-course family-style Italian meal at Rao&#x27;s restaurant for the judges and Rao&#x27;s owners and staff.

On an episode of &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot;, Season 7, episode 2 &quot;Pantaleone&#x27;s&quot;, Gordon Ramsay talks about the history of Rao&#x27;s restaurant to the family who owns the pizza shop &quot;Pantalone&#x27;s&quot; in Denver, Colorado. He then takes the father and son to the Rao&#x27;s restaurant at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas. They then meet the owner, Frank Pellegrino Jr., and learn that he is the fourth generation of successors to operate the family-owned restaurant.

Rao&#x27;s was profiled on the pilot episode of &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; as home of Bobby Flay&#x27;s favorite meal.

In Season 7, Episode 11 of the TV show &quot;Billions&quot; Bobby Axelrod takes an influential politician to Rao&#x27;s for dinner.

<text>A sloppy joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef, onions, tomato sauce or ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings served on a hamburger bun. There are several theories about the sandwich&#x27;s origin.

==History==
Early and mid-20th century American cookbooks offer plenty of sloppy joe-type recipes, though they go by different names: Toasted Deviled Hamburgers, Chopped Meat Sandwiches, Spanish Hamburgers, Hamburg a la Creole, Beef Mironton, and Minced Beef Spanish Style.

One theory of the sandwich&#x27;s origin is that in 1917, Havana, Cuba bar owner José &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot; Abeal y Otero created &quot;a simple sandwich filled with ground beef stewed in tomatoes.&quot; This was possibly his interpretation of ropa vieja or picadillo. His bar was reportedly frequented by Americans and Britons, including Errol Flynn, Ernest Hemingway, and Graham Greene. Circa 1937, Hemingway convinced Joe Russell, a bar owner in Key West, Florida, to rename his Silver Slipper bar Sloppy Joe&#x27;s. Town Hall Deli in New Jersey claims that this same Cuban bar also served a messy sliced ham and turkey sandwich with Russian dressing that Town Hall copied and also named &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot; after the bar, creating much confusion.

Marilyn Brown, director of the consumer test kitchen at H.J. Heinz in Pittsburgh, says their research at the Carnegie Library suggests that the sloppy joe&#x27;s origins lie with the &quot;loose meat sandwiches&quot; sold in Sioux City, Iowa, in the 1930s and were the creation of a cook named Joe.

A 1940 advertisement illustrates another use for the term &quot;Sloppy Joe;&quot; a women&#x27;s cardigan sweater, described as &quot;ever popular.&quot;

References to sloppy joes as sandwiches begin by the 1940s. One example from Ohio is a 1944 &quot;Coshocton Tribune&quot; ad under the heading Good Things to Eat&#x27; says &#x27;Sloppy Joes&#x27; – 10c – Originated in Cuba – You&#x27;ll ask for more – The Hamburg Shop&quot; and elsewhere on the same page, &quot;Hap is introducing that new sandwich at The Hamburg Shop – Sloppy Joes – 10c&quot;.

Food companies began producing packaged sloppy joe, in cans with meat, or just the sauce, such as Manwich, by the 1960s.

A 1975 &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot; defines &quot;sloppy joe&quot; as any cheap restaurant or lunch counter serving cheap food quickly.

==Variations==
Several variations of the sloppy joe exist in North America. In Quebec, sandwiches of stewed ground beef such as &quot;pain à la viande&quot; and &quot;pain fourré gumbo&quot; are usually served on hot dog buns. A similar sandwich, the &quot;dynamite&quot;, exists in the area around Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and is distinguished by the use of onions, bell peppers, and sometimes celery.

Stewed meat sandwiches are common in several other culinary traditions as well. The &quot;rou jia mo&quot;, from China&#x27;s Shaanxi Province, consists of stewed pork, beef, or lamb on &quot;baijimo&quot;, a type of flatbread.

Keema pav of Indian cuisine uses a &quot;pav&quot; (from , the Portuguese word for bread) bread roll filled with keema, a minced, stewed, curried meat. In Brazil, a sandwich is prepared with ground beef in a bread roll.

===New Jersey===
In some stores in northern New Jersey, an unrelated sandwich made with a combination of lunch meats, such as turkey, roast beef, or especially pastrami, with coleslaw, Russian dressing, and Swiss cheese on three slices of rye bread is also known as a sloppy joe.

<text>New School High School of Monmouth County (NSHS) was a high school in the Monmouth County area of New Jersey that opened in 1998, notable for its style of alternative education until its closure in 2004.

The New School of Monmouth County High School 
Founded by former public school teacher Dale Thompson and the daughter of one of the founders of the original New School elementary school, Rebekah Chilvers, the New School High School marked a radical departure from traditional educational philosophy. The New School tenets were drawn from a variety of British alternative teaching practice known as &quot;open-classroom.&quot; Rather than relying on tests and grades to measure student progress, the New School High School or NSHS abolished these practices and instead centered on individualized learning centered on all-encompassing yearly themes. Work completed during the course of the year was collected in a portfolio, which served as an alternative method of measuring student&#x27;s achievements (rather than using grades). The NSHS also had rather lax policies, compared to traditional public schools, in such areas as scheduling, dress codes, etc.

However, the NSHS never grew to a particularly large size. After a peak in enrollment in the 2001–2002 school year, the size of the student body began declining. The replacement of Dale&#x27;s Thompson&#x27;s co-teacher twice also caused some difficulty for the school. In 2003, the NSHS&#x27;s name was changed to the Atlantic School.

The Atlantic School was short lived. In June 2004, the last graduates were promoted and the school itself shut down.

<text>The Turner Cup was the championship trophy of the International Hockey League from 1945 to 2001 and the renamed United Hockey League from 2007 to 2010. The Cup was named for Joe Turner, a goaltender from Windsor, Ontario. Turner became professional with the Detroit Red Wings organization, and played one season with the Indianapolis Capitals in the American Hockey League. Turner was killed in Belgium during World War II, while serving with the United States Army.

It was the championship trophy to the incarnation of the IHL that existed from 1945 to 2001 before it was retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame. In July 2007, the United Hockey League officially changed its name to &quot;International Hockey League&quot;. The new IHL put forth a request to the Hockey Hall of Fame to take a controlling interest in the Turner Cup. The name Turner Cup was restored on September 24, 2007 as a tribute to the original IHL. When the incarnation of the IHL that existed from 2007 to 2010 folded, the Cup was retired again and looked to be put back in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="989678" wikidata="Q3328734" url="?curid=989678" title="Music of Oman">
<text>The music of [[Oman]] has been strongly affected by the country&#x27;s coastal location, with Omani sailors interacting with, and bringing back music from, Egypt, Tanzania and elsewhere. More recently, a Portuguese occupation has left its own marks, while geographic neighbors like the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also had a profound influence. In contrast to other Arab countries, Omani traditional music has a strong emphasis on rhythm.

Traditional music marks all the stages in the life of an Omani, including birth, circumcision, marriage and death. In contrast to many Arab countries, all Omanis participate in music, men and women, young and old.

Liwa and Fann at-Tanbura are types of music and dance performed mainly in communities of descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region.

The Omani Centre for Traditional Music claims that Arabic music in Oman can be characterized by &quot;tetrachords with typical Arabic intervals, including three-quarter tones taken from the Arabic musical scales; the maqamat&quot;.

Notable Omani musicians include Salim Rashid Suri, the &quot;Singing Sailor&quot;, a 20th-century singer and oud player from Sur who combined strains of the ṣawt of the northern Persian Gulf and other musical traditions of the Indian Ocean as a pioneer of the genre called Ṣawt al-Khaleej (&quot;Voice of the Gulf&quot;).

There is also a very small underground metal scene with bands like Arabia and Belos emerging from there, the former moving to the UK.

<text>Wenona was a historical settlement in the U.S. state of Michigan, located in what is now Bay City at .

The village was founded in 1863 by Henry W. Sage (1814-1897), a merchant and philanthropist, who along with John McGraw also founded the Sage, McGraw &amp; Company sawmill on the west bank of the Saginaw River. The sawmill, which was the largest in the state, was an early economic center of the community. Sage initially platted the settlement with the name &quot;Lake City&quot;, but because there was another Lake City in Michigan, it was renamed Wenona after the mother of Hiawatha in the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. George H. Bates became the first postmaster on February 14, 1865. Wenona incorporated as a village in 1867, and, in 1877 the Michigan Legislature consolidated Wenona with two other nearby villages, Banks and Salzburgh to form the city of West Bay City. In 1905, West Bay City merged with Bay City.

The fortunes created from the sawmill operation in Wenona and the lumber industry it supported formed the basis of important early gifts to Cornell University.

<text>Fenfluramine, sold under the brand name Fintepla, is a serotonergic medication used for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It was formerly used as an appetite suppressant in the treatment of obesity, but was discontinued for this use due to cardiovascular toxicity before being repurposed for new indications. Fenfluramine was used for weight loss both alone under the brand name Pondimin and in combination with phentermine commonly known as fen-phen.
Side effects of fenfluramine in people treated for seizures include decreased appetite, somnolence, sedation, lethargy, diarrhea, constipation, abnormal echocardiogram, fatigue, malaise, asthenia, ataxia, balance disorder, gait disturbance, increased blood pressure, drooling, excessive salivation, fever, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, appetite loss, weight loss, falls, and status epilepticus. Fenfluramine acts as a serotonin and norepinephrine releasing agent, agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, and sigma σ1 receptor positive modulator. Its mechanism of action in the treatment of seizures is unknown, but may involve increased activation of certain serotonin receptors and the sigma σ1 receptor. Chemically, fenfluramine is a phenethylamine and amphetamine.
Fenfluramine was developed in the early 1960s and was first introduced for medical use as an appetite suppressant in France in 1963 followed by approval in the United States in 1973. In the 1990s, fenfluramine came to be associated with cardiovascular toxicity, and because of this, was withdrawn from the United States market in 1997. Subsequently, it was repurposed for the treatment of seizures and was reintroduced in the United States and the European Union in 2020. Fenfluramine was previously a schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. However, the substance has since no-longer been subject to control pursuant to rule-making issued on 23 December 2022.

==Medical uses==

===Seizures===
Fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome in people age two and older.

Dravet syndrome is a life-threatening, rare and chronic form of epilepsy. It is often characterized by severe and unrelenting seizures despite medical treatment.

===Obesity===
Fenfluramine was formerly used as an appetite suppressant in the treatment of obesity, but was withdrawn for this use due to cardiovascular toxicity.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse reactions in people with seizures include decreased appetite; drowsiness, sedation and lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue or lack of energy; ataxia (lack of coordination), balance disorder, gait disturbance (trouble with walking); increased blood pressure; drooling, salivary hypersecretion (saliva overproduction); pyrexia (fever); upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; risk of falls; and status epilepticus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fenfluramine labeling includes a boxed warning stating the drug is associated with valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Because of the risks of VHD and PAH, fenfluramine is available only through a restricted drug distribution program, under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The fenfluramine REMS requires health care professionals who prescribe fenfluramine and pharmacies that dispense fenfluramine to be specially certified in the fenfluramine REMS and that patients be enrolled in the REMS. As part of the REMS requirements, prescribers and patients must adhere to the required cardiac monitoring with echocardiograms to receive fenfluramine.

At higher therapeutic doses, headache, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, lethargy, and stimulation have been reported with fenfluramine.

There have been reports associating chronic fenfluramine treatment with emotional instability, cognitive deficits, depression, psychosis, exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis (schizophrenia), and sleep disturbances. It has been suggested that some of these effects may be mediated by serotonergic neurotoxicity/depletion of serotonin with chronic administration and/or activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.

===Heart valve disease===
The distinctive valvular abnormality seen with fenfluramine is a thickening of the leaflet and chordae tendineae. One mechanism used to explain this phenomenon involves heart valve serotonin receptors, which are thought to help regulate growth. Since fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine stimulate serotonin receptors, this may have led to the valvular abnormalities found in patients using fenfluramine. In particular norfenfluramine is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals. Fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine affect the 5-HT2B receptors, which are plentiful in human cardiac valves. The suggested mechanism by which fenfluramine causes damage is through over or inappropriate stimulation of these receptors leading to inappropriate valve cell division. Supporting this idea is the fact that this valve abnormality has also occurred in patients using other drugs that act on 5-HT2B receptors.

According to a study of 5,743 former users conducted by a plaintiff&#x27;s expert cardiologist, damage to the heart valve continued long after stopping the medication. Of the users tested, 20% of women, and 12% of men were affected. For all ex-users, there was a 7-fold increase of chances of needing surgery for faulty heart valves caused by the drug.

==Overdose==
In overdose, fenfluramine can cause serotonin syndrome and rapidly result in death.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Fenfluramine acts primarily as a serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It increases the level of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite and other functions. Fenfluramine causes the release of serotonin by disrupting vesicular storage of the neurotransmitter, and reversing serotonin transporter function. The drug also acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent (NRA) to a lesser extent, particularly via its active metabolite norfenfluramine. At high concentrations, norfenfluramine, though not fenfluramine, also acts as a dopamine releasing agent (DRA), and so fenfluramine may do this at very high doses as well. In addition to monoamine release, while fenfluramine binds only very weakly to the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, norfenfluramine binds to and activates the serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors with high affinity and the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with moderate affinity. The result of the increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission is a feeling of fullness and reduced appetite.

In spite of acting as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, fenfluramine has been described as non-hallucinogenic. However, psychedelic effects and hallucinations have occasionally been reported when large doses of fenfluramine are taken.Similarly to the psychedelic amphetamine DOI, it is the R-Enatiomer (Levofenfluramine) that is more likely to elicit psychedelia, this also holds true for 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA)

Fenfluramine was identified as a potent positive modulator of the σ1 receptor in 2020 and this action may be involved in its therapeutic benefits in the treatment of seizures.

Fenfluramine is inactive as an agonist of the rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Norfenfluramine is an agonist of the human TAAR1, with dexnorfenfluramine acting as a very weak agonist of the receptor (43% of maximum at a concentration of 10,000nM) and levonorfenfluramine being inactive.

The combination of fenfluramine with phentermine, a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) acting primarily on norepinephrine, results in a well-balanced serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) with weaker effects of dopamine release.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The elimination half-life of fenfluramine has been reported as ranging from 13 to 30 hours. The mean elimination half-lives of its enantiomers have been found to be 19 hours for dexfenfluramine and 25 hours for levfenfluramine. Norfenfluramine, the major active metabolite of fenfluramine, has an elimination half-life that is about 1.5 to 2 times as long as that of fenfluramine, with mean values of 34 hours for dexnorfenfluramine and 50 hours for levnorfenfluramine.

==Chemistry==
Fenfluramine is a substituted amphetamine and is also known as 3-trifluoromethyl-&quot;N&quot;-ethylamphetamine. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine. Some analogues of fenfluramine include norfenfluramine, benfluorex, flucetorex, and fludorex.

==History==
Fenfluramine was developed in the early 1960s and was introduced in France in 1963. Approximately 50 million Europeans were treated with fenfluramine for appetite suppression between 1963 and 1996. Fenfluramine was approved in the United States in 1973. The combination of fenfluramine and phentermine was proposed in 1984. Approximately 5 million people in the United States were given fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with or without phentermine between 1996 and 1998.

In the early 1990s, French researchers reported an association of fenfluramine with primary pulmonary hypertension and dyspnea in a small sample of patients. Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease and continued findings of pulmonary hypertension, including a condition known as cardiac fibrosis. It was subsequently withdrawn from other markets around the world. It was banned in India in 1998.

Fenfluramine was an appetite suppressant which was used to treat obesity. It was used both on its own and, in combination with phentermine, as part of the anti-obesity medication Fen-Phen.

In June 2020, fenfluramine was approved for medical use in the United States with an indication to treat Dravet syndrome.

The effectiveness of fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome was demonstrated in two clinical studies in 202 subjects between ages two and eighteen. The studies measured the change from baseline in the frequency of convulsive seizures. In both studies, subjects treated with fenfluramine had significantly greater reductions in the frequency of convulsive seizures during the trials than subjects who received placebo (inactive treatment). These reductions were seen within 3–4 weeks, and remained generally consistent over the 14- to 15-week treatment periods.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for fenfluramine priority review and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted approval of Fintepla to Zogenix, Inc.

On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Fintepla, intended for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2020.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
Fenfluramine is a prescription medication in the US. Fenfluramine was removed from Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act in December 2022.

===Recreational use and effects===
Unlike various other amphetamine derivatives, fenfluramine is reported to be dysphoric, &quot;unpleasantly lethargic&quot;, and non-addictive at therapeutic doses. However, it has been reported to be used recreationally at high doses ranging between 80 and 400 mg, which have been described as producing euphoria, amphetamine-like effects, sedation, and hallucinogenic effects, along with anxiety, nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes panic attacks, as well as depressive symptoms once the drug had worn off. At very high doses (e.g., 240 mg, or between 200 and 600 mg), fenfluramine induces a psychedelic state resembling that produced by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

Fenfluramine has been found to produce acute effects in humans including decreased arousal, elation, and positive mood, decreased anxiety at lower doses and increased anxiety at higher doses, drug disliking, confusion, reduced psychomotor performance, reduced impulsivity, and decreased aggression. Whereas fenfluramine alone decreases positive mood and phentermine alone increases positive mood similarly to amphetamine, the combination of fenfluramine and phentermine results in a neutral impact on mood. Similarly fenfluramine diminishes the subjective effects of phentermine and amphetamine. In contrast to other serotonin releasers like MDMA and mephedrone, fenfluramine does not produce euphoria. The differing effects with fenfluramine may be attributable to its lack of concomitant dopamine release and its potent serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonism via its metabolite norfenfluramine.

==Research==
===Social deficits===
Fenfluramine has been reported to improve social deficits in children with autism. In addition, it has been found to produce prosocial behavior similarly to the entactogen MDMA in animals. However, fenfluramine has shown limited effectiveness in treating the symptoms of autism generally. Moreover, the cardiovascular toxicity and neurotoxicity of fenfluramine make it unsuitable for clinical use in the treatment of social deficits.

<doc id="989687" wikidata="Q233773" url="?curid=989687" title="42nd Street (musical)">
<text>42nd Street is a 1980 stage musical with a book by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble, lyrics by Al Dubin and Johnny Mercer and music by Harry Warren. The 1980 Broadway production won the Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Choreography and it became a long-running hit. The show was also produced in London in 1984 (winning the Olivier Award for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony Award for Best Revival.

Based on the 1932 novel by Bradford Ropes and the subsequent 1933 Hollywood film adaptation, this backstage musical follows the rehearsal process of a Broadway show staged during the height of the Great Depression.

The show is a jukebox musical of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film &quot;42nd Street&quot;, it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, &quot;Roman Scandals&quot;, &quot;Dames&quot;, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;, &quot;Go into Your Dance,&quot; &quot;Gold Diggers of 1937&quot; and &quot;The Singing Marine&quot;. It also includes &quot;There&#x27;s a Sunny Side to Every Situation&quot;, written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for &quot;Hard to Get&quot;. A 2017 revival added the song &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, written by Warren and Dubin for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;.

==Background==
Producer David Merrick &quot;took a huge gamble with his $3 million production based on the 1933 Warner Brothers film musical&quot;, as &quot;only one other show had made the transfer from original movie musical to the stage — &quot;Gigi&quot;, a flop in 1974.&quot; He felt audiences once again were ready to embrace the nostalgia craze started by the successful revivals of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, &quot;Irene&quot;, and his own &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot; several years earlier, and augmented the familiar songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack with a liberal dose of popular tunes from the Dubin-Warren catalog. According to theater historian John Kenrick, &quot;When the curtain slowly rose to reveal forty pairs of tap-dancing feet, the star-studded opening night audience at the Winter Garden cheered...Champion followed this number with a series of tap-infused extravaganzas larger and more polished than anything Broadway really had in the 1930s.&quot;

==Productions==
===Original Broadway production (1980–89) ===
In June 1980, the musical premiered in out-of-town tryouts at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is located in Washington, D.C. The musical opened on Broadway on August 25, 1980, at the Winter Garden Theatre, and then moved to the Majestic and finally to the St. James, closing on January 8, 1989, after 3,486 performances and 6 previews. The production was directed and choreographed by Gower Champion. It was produced by David Merrick and featured orchestrations by Philip J. Lang. The original cast included Jerry Orbach as Julian Marsh, Tammy Grimes as Dorothy Brock, Wanda Richert as Peggy Sawyer, and Lee Roy Reams as Billy Lawlor. Notable replacements included Barry Nelson and Don Chastain and Jamie Ross who played Julian for the last three years of its Broadway run, Elizabeth Allen, Dolores Gray and Millicent Martin as Dorothy, and Lisa Brown, Mary Cadorette and Karen Ziemba as Peggy. (Karen Prunzik, who originated the role of Anytime Annie, briefly played the role of Peggy when Wanda Richert became ill and her understudy abruptly quit the show.) The show&#x27;s designers, Robin Wagner (sets), Theoni V. Aldredge (costumes), and Tharon Musser (lights) were the same team who had designed the original Broadway production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. The original Broadway production is the 16th longest running show in Broadway history, as of October 1, 2021.

However, the opening night triumph was overshadowed by tragedy. Following a lengthy standing ovation, Merrick went onstage and stated, &quot;This is a very tragic moment... I&#x27;m sorry to have to report that today, Gower Champion died.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the first part of his announcement was met with a few laughs from the audience, who thought this was another example of Merrick&#x27;s publicity stunts. But as soon as he said that Champion had died, there were &quot;gasps and screams.&quot; He then embraced a crying Richert, who was making her Broadway debut at the time. The producer had told only Bramble of Champion&#x27;s death and they managed to withhold the news from the cast (including Richert, who was the director&#x27;s girlfriend), the crew, and the public prior to the curtain call. &quot;42nd Street&quot; proved to be not only Champion&#x27;s last show but Merrick&#x27;s final success. Merrick lived until April 25, 2000, but, as described by Anthony Bianco, &quot;42nd Street&quot; &quot;was his last big hit, his swan song&quot;.

This Tony Award–nominated wardrobe, designed by Theoni V. Aldredge, is on rotating display at the Wick Theatre and Costume Museum in Boca Raton, Florida.

===West End (1984–89)===
The West End production opened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on August 8, 1984, starring James Laurenson as Julian Marsh, Georgia Brown as Dorothy Brock, Clare Leach as Peggy Sawyer, Michael Howe as Billy Lawler and Margaret Courtenay as Maggie Jones. Frankie Vaughn later took over as Julian Marsh, with Shani Wallis as Dorothy Brock and Maxine Audley as Maggie Jones. The career of teenaged Catherine Zeta-Jones, a chorus member in the 1984 West End production, was launched when a vacation and an illness felled both the actress portraying Peggy Sawyer and her understudy when one of the producers happened to be in the audience. Zeta-Jones filled-in and was impressive enough to be cast permanently in the role shortly afterward. The Production closed on January 7, 1989 after nearly 5 years, one day before the original Broadway production closed.

===International productions===
A San Francisco production opened at the Golden Gate Theatre on February 19, 1985, and ran through July 20, concurrently with the original Broadway production.

The Sydney production of 42nd Street opened on June 2, 1989, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney. It closed July 28, 1990. The show starred Barry Quin as Julian Marsh, Nancye Hayes as Dorothy Brock, Leonie Page as Peggy Sawyer, Todd McKenney as Billy Lawler and Toni Lamond as Maggie Jones, with Dein Perry as Andy Lee.

After the closure of the resident Theatre Royal Drury Lane production, the show would see a return engagement at the Dominion Theatre for a limited run between February 27 to April 20, 1991. Most notably the production featured Richard Armitage who was a part of the chorus.

A new production was staged for the Chichester Festival at the Chichester Festival Theatre in summer 2011. It was directed by Paul Kerryson with new choreography by Andrew Wright and starred Kathryn Evans as Dorothy and Tim Flavin as Julian. This production transferred to Curve in Leicester for the Christmas 2011 season (breaking all previous box office records for the theatre). Tim Flavin reprised his role, Ria Jones played Dorothy and Daisy Maywood portrayed Peggy.

===UK tours===
The limited-run production at the Dominion Theatre toured the UK starring Bonnie Langford as Peggy. Three more UK Touring productions were produced by UK Productions in 1997, 1999 and 2000. Gemma Craven starred as Dorothy in the 1997 tour, Ruth Madoc starred as Dorothy in the 1999 and 2000 productions and James Smillie starred as Julian Marsh in all three productions. The 2001 production, by UK Productions, toured the UK in 2007. The cast included Paul Nicholas as Julian for the first part of the tour, later replaced by Dave Willetts, Julia J. Nagle as Dorothy, Jessica Punch as Peggy, Graham Hoadly as Bert Barry, Shirley Jameson as Maggie Jones and Ashley Nottingham as Billy. UK Productions mounted a second UK tour of the show in 2012 with Dave Willetts reprising the role of Julian, Marti Webb playing Dorothy, Graham Hoadly as Bert Barry, Carol Ball as Maggie Jones and Mark Bramble directing. A 2023 production run began in May 2023, which starred Ruthie Henshall as Dorothy Brock, Adam Garcia as Julian Marsh, Josefina Gabrielle as Maggie Jones and Les Dennis as Bert Barry, which later concluded in January 2024 when the tour transferred to Toronto.

===Broadway revival (2001–05)===
Bramble revised the book for and directed the Broadway revival, with choreography by Randy Skinner (dance assistant for the original production). It opened, after 31 previews starting April 4, on May 2, 2001, at the Lyric Theatre (formerly the Ford Center for the Performing Arts), where it ran for 1,524 performances and closed January 2, 2005. The cast included Michael Cumpsty as Julian Marsh, Christine Ebersole as Dorothy Brock, Kate Levering as Peggy Sawyer, and David Elder as Billy Lawlor. Meredith Patterson, who made her Broadway musical debut in the chorus and was the understudy for the role of Peggy Sawyer, took over the role in August 2001. Todd Lattimore, who had been a swing and understudy, took the role of Billy. Other notable replacements included Patrick Cassidy and Tom Wopat as Julian and Shirley Jones and Beth Leavel as Dorothy.

=== Stuttgart revival ===
Mark Bramble&#x27;s Broadway Revival was reproduced in Stuttgart at the Stage Apollo Theater by Stage Entertainment. Performances began November 21, 2003, before closing December 31, 2004. The cast included Kevin Tarte as Julian Marsh, Isabel Dörfler as Dorothy Brock, Karin Seyfried as Peggy Sawyer, Jens Janke as Billy Lawlor, and Daniel Coninx as Abner Dillon.

===Asia tour===
An Asia tour of the Broadway revival played major venues throughout China and South Korea, with an English–speaking company directed by Mark Bramble. The cast included Paul Gregory Nelson as Julian, Natalie Buster as Dorothy, Kristen Martin as Peggy, and Charles MacEachern as Billy.

===US tours===
A slightly updated version of the 2001 revival, revised and directed by Mark Bramble and choreographed by Randy Skinner, began a United States tour in September 2015, opening in Salt Lake City, Utah on 22 September 2015. Matthew J. Taylor played Julian Marsh, Caitlin Ehlinger played Peggy Sawyer, and Blake Standik played Billy Lawlor. This production with a new cast, would tour the US again, from 2016 to 2017.

===West End revival===
A slightly revised version of the 2001 Broadway revival began a West End revival with previews on March 20, 2017, at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, where the show had its original London production, with an official opening night on April 4. Mark Bramble once again directed and Randy Skinner choreographed. The cast included Sheena Easton in her West End debut as Dorothy Brock, Clare Halse as Peggy Sawyer, Stuart Neal as Billy Lawlor and Tom Lister as Julian Marsh. Bruce Montague who previously starred in the UK Tour reprised his role. Graeme Henderson who previously played the role of Billy Lawlor in the original West End production and Andy in a UK Tour also reprised his role as Andy. The opening night was attended by The Duchess of Cambridge in her role as Royal Patron of the East Anglia Children&#x27;s Hospices (EACH). On March 19, 2018, Lulu took over from Easton as Dorothy Brock for a 16-week tenure, and Ashley Day took over from Neal as Billy Lawlor, with Lister and Halse remaining in the show. Steph Parry - who in March 2018 joined &quot;42nd Street&quot; as understudy for the roles of Dorothy Brock and Maggie Jones - took over from Lulu as Dorothy Brock on July 9, 2018. Bonnie Langford who played the role of Peggy in a previous UK Tour took over as Dorothy Brock on September 3, 2018, until the show closed on January 5, 2019.

The production was recorded in November 2018 and aired live across cinemas in the UK. It eventually aired on PBS&#x27;s Great Performances&#x27; third annual &quot;Broadway&#x27;s Best&quot; lineup in November 2019.

===Ogunquit Playhouse===
Ogunquit Playhouse&#x27;s production began previews on June 19, 2019, with the official opening on June 21, 2019. Randy Skinner directed and choreographed as it was the first major production since Bramble&#x27;s passing in February 2019. The cast included Rachel York in a return to the Ogunquit Playhouse stage as Dorothy Brock, Sally Struthers as Maggie Jones, Jessica Wockenfuss as Peggy Sawyer, Steve Blanchard as Julian Marsh and Con O&#x27;Shea Creal as Billy Lawlor. The production was assistant-choreographed by Sara Brians who made her Broadway debut with the 2001 revival, and utilized sets designed by Douglas W. Schmidt for previous tours of 42nd Street. Costumes were sourced from a previous production in Stuttgart and various US Tours. Jeffrey Campos served as musical director.

== Plot ==
; Act I
Auditions for 1933&#x27;s newest show, &quot;Pretty Lady&quot;, are nearly over when Peggy Sawyer, fresh off the bus from Allentown, Pennsylvania, arrives in New York City with valise in hand. Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (&quot;Young and Healthy&quot;). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy&#x27;s latest conquest and tells her, &quot;Amscray, toots.&quot; Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh. One-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by co-writer and producer Bert Barry that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (&quot;Shadow Waltz&quot;). Despite feeling she is a prima donna past her prime, Marsh agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, co-writer and producer Maggie Jones and chorus girls Ann &quot;Anytime Annie&quot; Reilly, Phyllis Dale, and Lorraine Flemming take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (&quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot;).

Dorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from &quot;Pretty Lady&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re Getting to be a Habit With Me&quot;). Peggy faints and is taken to Dorothy&#x27;s dressing room. Pat Denning (Dorothy&#x27;s secret long-term boyfriend and former vaudeville partner) is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and, assuming they are having an affair, blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and, fearing that Abner will pull funding for the show, decides to end the affair between them. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of thugs who convince him to break it off with her. The show&#x27;s cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, for the out-of-town tryout (&quot;Getting Out of Town&quot;).

The scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (&quot;Dames/Keep Young and Beautiful/Dames (Reprise)&quot;). Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending a planned party, and he accepts because he is attracted to her. At the party, a drunk Dorothy, who misses Pat, tells Abner she was only with him because of his money and breaks up with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, becoming greatly upset (&quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; and &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;).

&quot;Pretty Lady&quot; finally opens (&quot;We&#x27;re in the Money&quot;), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. When Dorothy cannot get up, an angered Julian immediately fires Peggy, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.

; Act II
Dorothy&#x27;s ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (&quot;Sunny Side to Every Situation&quot;). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she&#x27;s a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs. At Philadelphia&#x27;s Broad Street Station, Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words &quot;Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...&quot; After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (&quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;). Forced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is about to mentally collapse when Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals, unexpectedly visits her and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, &quot;maybe even better than I would have been&quot;. She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, &quot;About a Quarter to Nine.&quot;

It is time for the curtain to rise again (&quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot;). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, now completely in love with Peggy, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, &quot;You&#x27;re going out there a youngster, but you&#x27;ve got to come back a star!&quot; The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (&quot;42nd Street&quot;). In addition, although she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, &quot;Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I&#x27;m taking you to...42nd Street&quot; (&quot;42nd Street (Reprise)&quot;).

<text>John Peter Sarsgaard (; born March 7, 1971) is an American actor. He studied at the Actors Studio, before rising to prominence playing atypical and sometimes villainous roles in film and television. 

He made his film debut with &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995). He gained recognition for his role in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998), &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Center of the World&quot; (2001). He received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Charles Lane in &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; (2003) and won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor
for playing a man with dementia in &quot;Memory&quot; (2023). 

Sarsgaard has acted in films, such as &quot;Garden State&quot;, &quot;Kinsey&quot; (both 2004), &quot;Jarhead&quot;, &quot;Flightplan&quot; (both 2005), &quot;Elegy&quot; (2008), &quot;An Education&quot;, &quot;Orphan&quot; (both 2009), &quot;Lovelace&quot;, &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; (both 2013), &quot;Black Mass&quot; (2015), &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot; (2021). He is also known for acting in blockbuster films, such as &quot;Knight and Day&quot; (2010), &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (2011), &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022).
Sarsgaard is also known for his television roles including in the AMC/Netflix crime series &quot;The Killing&quot; (2013) and the Hulu limited series &quot;The Looming Tower&quot; (2018) and &quot;Dopesick&quot; (2021), the latter of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Sarsgaard made his Broadway debut portraying Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin in the revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; (2008). He is married to Maggie Gyllenhaal since 2009.

==Early life and education==
John Peter Sarsgaard was born at Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois, on March 7, 1971, the son of Judy Lea (&quot;née&quot; Reinhardt) and John Dale Sarsgaard. His father was an Air Force engineer and later worked for Monsanto and IBM. His surname originates in Denmark, where his paternal great-great-grandparents were born; it is pronounced in Danish.

Sarsgaard was raised a Catholic and served as an altar boy. His family moved more than 12 times during his childhood, following his father&#x27;s job. At the age of 7, Sarsgaard originally wanted to become a soccer player and took up ballet to help improve his coordination. After suffering several concussions while playing soccer, he gave up the sport and became interested in writing and theater. He attended Fairfield College Preparatory School, a private Jesuit boys&#x27; school in Connecticut, where he became interested in film.

Following his graduation from Fairfield Prep in 1989, he attended Bard College in New York for two years before transferring to Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) in 1991, where he co-founded an improvisational comedy troupe &quot;Mama&#x27;s Pot Roast&quot;. While at WashU, Sarsgaard began performing in plays in an offshoot of New York&#x27;s Actors Studio; His first role was as the servant Laurent in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. In 1993, he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and moved to New York.

==Career==
===1995–1998: Early work===
Sarsgaard branched out with guest roles in television productions filmed in New York City, with &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1995, and &quot;New York Undercover&quot; (1997) as well as an appearance in the 1997 HBO special &quot;Subway Stories&quot;. He appeared in his first film role in &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995), where he was cast as a murdered teenager, killed by Sean Penn&#x27;s character.

In 1995, Sarsgaard made his theatrical debut in the Off-Broadway production of Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;Laura Dennis&quot;, which was directed by James Houghton. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Sarsgaard ... emerges as an actor to watch with a performance of breathtaking emotional conviction.&quot; The following year he starred in &quot;Kingdom of Earth&quot; opposite Cynthia Nixon and directed by John Cameron Mitchell. His performance in the play received favorable reviews among critics.

His next film roles were in a series of independent features: &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; (1997), part of an ensemble cast that included James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Vincent Kartheiser, and Natasha Gregson Wagner, and In &quot;Desert Blue&quot; (1998), where he had a supporting role in the film. He received a substantial role in the 1998 film &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, where he played Raoul, the ill-fated son of John Malkovich&#x27;s dueling Musketeer, Athos. The film uses characters from Alexandre Dumas&#x27; d&#x27;Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;. The film received ambivalent reviews, but was a success at the box office, earning $182 million worldwide.

===1999–2002: Worldwide recognition===
In 1999, Sarsgaard earned critical recognition in Kimberly Peirce&#x27;s &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, where he was cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film is based on the real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Peter Sarsgaard ... makes the killer&#x27;s terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn&#x27;t a drooling monster, he&#x27;s a guy you wouldn&#x27;t look twice at a bar or a convenience store.&quot; A contributor from the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s a marvelous performance supported ably by ... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter.&quot; The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him &quot;likeable, sympathetic even&quot; was because he wanted the audience &quot;to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn&#x27;t necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren&#x27;t going to have a dull time if you were with him.&quot; In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt &quot;empowered&quot; by playing Lotter.

His first leading role was in the 2001 feature &quot;The Center of the World&quot;, where he plays Richard Longman, a lonely young entrepreneur who skips out on his company&#x27;s big initial public offering and pays a stripper (Molly Parker) $10,000 to fly to Las Vegas with him. The film received average reviews, however, A.O. Scott of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, reported that the performances by both Sarsgaard and Parker &quot;provide a rough grain of authenticity, capturing the blunted affect and aimless neediness of people in their 20s struggling to navigate a world of material abundance and impoverished emotional possibility.&quot; Scott concluded in his recap that Sarsgaard made his character &quot;seem like a genuinely nice guy, too innocent to grasp the sleaziness of his bargain with Florence.&quot;

In 2002, Sarsgaard starred in three films, &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;. In &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;, he portrayed a young Russian navy lieutenant Vadim Radchenko, a prototype of Boris Korchilov. The film&#x27;s budget cost was $100 million to make, but upon release, it grossed $35 million in the United States and $30 million internationally, qualifying it as a box office failure. His next role was in &quot;Empire&quot;, a crime thriller, where he was cast in a supporting role. Sarsgaard played a meth addict in D. J. Caruso&#x27;s &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;. In October 2002, Sarsgaard returned to theater in a New York production of Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Burn This&quot;, where he replaced Edward Norton.

===2003–present: Continued success===
2003 marked a significant turning point in Sarsgaard&#x27;s career when he starred in the feature film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; is based on the real events of journalist Stephen Glass&#x27; career at &quot;The New Republic&quot; during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During the film&#x27;s promotion, Sarsgaard noted his portrayal of Lane: &quot;I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you&#x27;re respecting the real person you&#x27;re playing. I&#x27;ve done it a number of times. And it&#x27;s always a little bit confusing. The best thing to do is just to ignore the fact, I think, that you&#x27;re playing somebody who is a real-life character.&quot; According to the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, &quot;Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane&quot;. A reviewer from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with &quot;great subtlety and grace&quot;. The newspaper concluded with, &quot;The character doesn&#x27;t seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man&#x27;s value system being violated past the breaking point.&quot; Sarsgaard&#x27;s performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.

Following the success of &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, Sarsgaard starred in several roles. In 2004, he starred in the comedy-drama &quot;Garden State&quot;, where he played Mark, the sarcastic best friend to Zach Braff&#x27;s character. In the same year, Sarsgaard portrayed Clyde Martin, in the biographical film &quot;Kinsey&quot;, a movie about the life of Alfred Kinsey, played by Liam Neeson. &quot;Kinsey&quot; was Sarsgaard&#x27;s first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Sarsgaard&#x27;s Clyde Martin &quot;stands out&quot; and &quot;confirms that he&#x27;s without doubt one of the best character actors of his generation.&quot; When asked about his kissing scenes with Neeson in &quot;Kinsey&quot;, Sarsgaard said:

It wasn&#x27;t as hard as, say, running around with all my gear on in &quot;Jarhead&quot;. I&#x27;d rather go for an awkward moment than physical exertion any day. The only thing that I think [male actors] get freaked out about when they have to do something like kiss a guy in a movie—when to their knowledge they&#x27;re straight—is that they&#x27;re afraid they&#x27;re going to be turned on. And if you&#x27;re not afraid that you&#x27;re going to be turned on—meaning that you know what you like—then really it&#x27;s not that hard.
In 2005, Sarsgaard starred in the drama &quot;The Dying Gaul&quot;, where he plays Robert Sandrich, a struggling screenwriter who has written a serious love story about a man and his terminally ill partner. The film received favorable reviews. In an interview, Sarsgaard said, he felt like he was playing a character based on Craig Lucas, the director, whom he describes as &quot;elitist in a fun way&quot;. Because his character, a screenwriter, is also &quot;elitist,&quot; when he sells his soul by compromising his artistic vision, &quot;...the conflict seems bigger. Anyone can sell their soul. Even people with integrity. There&#x27;s always that temptation to guard against. Which is why it&#x27;s best to keep as much as possible hidden.&quot;

Also in 2005, he had supporting roles in the suspense thriller films &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot; and Robert Schwentke&#x27;s &quot;Flightplan&quot;. In the latter film, Sarsgaard played an air marshall, who is ordered to keep guard of Jodie Foster&#x27;s character. &quot;Flightplan&quot; was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was a financial success, earning $223 million worldwide, making it his highest-grossing film to the end of 2008. Sarsgaard&#x27;s next feature was &quot;Jarhead&quot; (2005), opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford&#x27;s 2003 Gulf War memoir of the same name.

Sarsgaard hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) on January 21, 2006. In his introductory monolog, he tried to point out that he was a nice guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the &quot;SNL&quot; cast. One sketch featured the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global scare, which was still fresh in many minds, and one of the skits included a promotion for the Peter Sarsgaard &quot;SARS-Guard&quot;, a reference to facemasks.
In 2007, he starred in supporting roles in &quot;Year of the Dog&quot; and &quot;Rendition&quot;. &quot;Year of the Dog&quot; is a dark comedy about a lonely middle-aged woman, played by Molly Shannon, who finds that animals are the only beings she can truly rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon&#x27;s character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in &quot;Rendition&quot;, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com&#x27;s Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama &quot;Elegy&quot;, based on a Phillip Roth novel, &quot;The Dying Animal&quot;. The film received favorable reception among critics. 

In 2008, Sarsgaard made his Broadway debut at the Royal Court Theatre of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s adaptation &quot;The Seagull&quot; alongside Kristin Scott Thomas, Mackenzie Crook and Carey Mulligan. In the production, he plays, Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin, a tortured writer who drives a rival to suicide and a young lover to ruin. For the role, Sarsgaard had been required to speak in a British accent, in which he wanted it to be &quot;less liked by an American audience&quot;. Adam Feldman for &quot;Time Out&quot; praised the production but wrote of Sarsgaard&#x27;s performance, &quot;Some of the Americans struggle—notably Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Trigorin’s passivity so aggressively that his costars have nothing to work against.&quot;

In 2009, Sarsgaard starred alongside Jon Foster and Sienna Miller in the drama &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;. It is an adaptation of Michael Chabon&#x27;s novel of the same name. In the movie, Sarsgaard plays Cleveland, the rebellious bisexual boyfriend of Miller&#x27;s character. &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. His next film appearance was in the thriller &quot;Orphan&quot;, where he and Vera Farmiga play a married couple who lose a baby and adopt a nine-year-old girl, who is not as innocent as she claims to be. Furthermore, in the same year, Sarsgaard starred as David in Lone Scherfig&#x27;s coming of age film &quot;An Education&quot;. The role required Sarsgaard to speak in a British accent. &quot;An Education&quot; drew favorable reviews from critics. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Sarsgaard ... marvelously expresses the savoir faire that has such an impact on Jenny [Carey Mulligan].&quot;

Sarsgaard played Mikhail Lvovich Astrov, a country doctor and philosopher, in the Classic Stage Company&#x27;s 2009 off-Broadway production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in New York City. The cast also included Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mamie Gummer, Denis O&#x27;Hare, and George Morfogen. The production, directed by Austin Pendleton, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the production one out of four stars, but complimented his performance, writing that Sarsgaard does a &quot;credible job as the doctor&quot;. In the Bloomberg review of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, John Simon, wrote: &quot;Sarsgaard can&#x27;t find the right tempi or emphases: shuttling between colorless rattle and silence-studded rallentandos, he fails at both infectious enthusiasm and self-effacing charm.&quot;

Sarsgaard played a federal agent in the action comedy film &quot;Knight and Day&quot;, released in June 2010, in which he appeared alongside Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. In May 2010, it was reported that Sarsgaard would star in Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. The production began in January 2011, and Sarsgaard was reunited with &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; director Austin Pendleton. In February 2010, it was announced that Sarsgaard had been cast as villain Hector Hammond in the superhero film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. The film was released in 2011. He played a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s drama &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; (2013). Sarsgaard also appeared in the American TV series &quot;The Killing&quot; (2013) as a man on death row perhaps wrongfully convicted for the brutal murder of his wife, a performance which he said included &quot;some of the best acting I have ever done in my life.&quot; Sarsgaard appeared in a 2015 Classic Stage Company production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the title role. He portrayed Robert F. Kennedy in Pablo Larraín&#x27;s &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016). 

Sarsgaard then took a role as Martin Schmidt in the Hulu limited series &quot;The Looming Tower&quot; (2018), earning a nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries. He returned to television in another Hulu miniseries &quot;Dopesick&quot; (2021) playing Rick Mountcastle, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nomination. Sarsgaard appeared in &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot; (2021), directed by his wife Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the following year played the role of District Attorney Gil Colson in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022). In 2023, he starred opposite Jessica Chastain in the Michel Franco film &quot;Memory&quot; which premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival. Sarsgaard portrayed a man riddled with dementia. He stated, &quot;A lot of time when we see dementia in movies, it&#x27;s the most extreme stage at the very end and it paralyses us all with fear, and I really didn&#x27;t want to depict that.&quot; For his performance he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor.

==Personal life==

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sarsgaard stated that he followed Catholicism, saying: &quot;I like the death-cult aspect of Catholicism. Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you&#x27;re supposed to love your enemy. That really impressed me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] The way that I view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing. To abandon curiosity in all personalities, good or bad, is to give up hope in humanity.&quot;

Among his most notable romantic relationships, Sarsgaard dated burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese and model and actress Shalom Harlow. Early in his film career, he dated photographer Malerie Marder, a close friend from his days attending Bard College, who had featured Sarsgaard in some of her early work.

Sarsgaard began a romantic relationship with actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, the sister of his close friend Jake Gyllenhaal, in 2002. In April 2006, they announced their engagement, and on May 2, 2009, they married in a small ceremony in Brindisi, Italy. They have two daughters, born in October 2006 and April 2012.

Sarsgaard is vegan, but says he cooks meat for his children.

In June 2013, Sarsgaard and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.

<text>Henry Harrison &quot;Tip&quot; Aplin (April 15, 1841 – July 23, 1910) was an American Civil War veteran, businessman, and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1901 to 1903.

==Early life and military career==
Aplin was born in Thetford Township, Michigan, and moved with his parents to Flint in 1848 where he attended the public schools. In the American Civil War, he enlisted on July 3, 1861, in Company C, Sixteenth Regiment, Michigan Volunteer Infantry, and served until July 16, 1865, with the rank of second lieutenant.

==Political career==
After the war, Aplin returned to Michigan and engaged in mercantile pursuits at Wenona (later West Bay City and now part of Bay City). He was postmaster of West Bay City from November 1869 to June 1886. He served as township clerk and township treasurer, each for three years and was a delegate to the 1884 Republican National Convention at Chicago.

Aplin was elected auditor general of the State in 1886 and 1888. He became interested in the construction of the electric railways of West Bay City and served as general manager until 1891. He was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1894 and 1895 and was again appointed postmaster of West Bay City, serving from October 1, 1898, to June 1902.

Due to the vacancy caused by the death of Rousseau O. Crump, Aplin was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 10th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the Fifty-seventh Congress. Aplin served from October 15, 1901 to March 3, 1903, and was an unsuccessful candidate for re-nomination in 1902, being defeated by fellow Republican George A. Loud.

==After politics==
After leaving Congress, Aplin engaged in agricultural pursuits and was also interested in the manufacture of ice.

==Death==
He died in Bay City on July 23, 1910, aged 69, and is interred in Elm Lawn Cemetery.

<doc id="989717" wikidata="Q50049" url="?curid=989717" title="Catherine Opie">
<text>Catherine Sue Opie (born 1961) is an American fine art photographer and educator. She lives and works in Los Angeles, as a professor of photography at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Opie studies the connections between mainstream and infrequent society. By specializing in portraiture, studio, and landscape photography, she is able to create pieces relating to sexual identity. Through photography, Opie documents the relationship between the individual and the space inhabited, offering an exploration of the American identity, particularly probing the tensions between the constructed American dream and the diverse realities of its citizens. Merging conceptual and documentary styles, Opie&#x27;s oeuvre gravitates towards portraiture and landscapes, utilizing serial images and unexpected compositions to both spotlight and blur the lines of gender, community, and place while invoking the formal gravitas reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture and hinting at her deep engagement with the history of art and painting. 

She is known for her portraits exploring the Los Angeles leather-dyke community. Her work is held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and she has won awards including the United States Artists Fellowship (2006) and the President’s Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Women’s Caucus for Art (2009).

== Life ==
Opie was born in Sandusky, Ohio. She spent her early childhood in Ohio and was influenced heavily by photographer Lewis Hine. At the age of nine, she received a Kodak Instamatic camera and immediately began taking photographs of her family and community. She evolved as an artist at age 14 when she created her own darkroom. Her family moved from Ohio to California in 1975. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1985.

She later received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 1988. Before arriving at CalArts, she was a strictly black-and-white photographer. Opie&#x27;s thesis project entitled &quot;Master Plan&quot; (1988) examined a wide variety of topics. The project looked deeper into construction sites, advertisement schemes, homeowner regulations, and the interior layout of their homes within the community of Valencia, California.

In 1988, Opie moved to Los Angeles, California, and began working as an artist. She supported herself by accepting a job as a lab technician at the University of California, Irvine. Opie and her former partner, painter Julie Burleigh, constructed working studios in the backyard of their home in South Central Los Angeles.

In 2001, Opie gave birth to a boy named Oliver through intrauterine insemination.

At the Hammer Museum, Opie was on the first Artist Council (a series of sessions with curators and museum administrators) and served on the board of overseers. Along with fellow artists John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, and Ed Ruscha, Opie served as a member of the board for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. In 2012, she and the others resigned; however, they joined the museum&#x27;s 14-member search committee for a new director after Jeffrey Deitch&#x27;s resignation in 2013. Opie returned in support of the museum&#x27;s new director, Philippe Vergne, in 2014. She was also on the board of the Andy Warhol Foundation.

Along with Richard Hawkins, Opie curated a selection of work by the late artist Tony Greene at the 2014 Whitney Biennial, in New York. As of 2017, Opie has her studio at The Brewery Art Colony. 

==Work==
===Art===

Opie&#x27;s work is characterized by a combination of formal concerns, a variety of printing technologies, references to art history, and social/political commentary. It demonstrates a mix between traditional photography and unconventional subjects. For example, she explores abstraction in the landscape vis-a-vis the placement of the horizon line in the &quot;Icehouses&quot; (2001) and &quot;Surfers&quot; (2003) series. She has printed photographs using Chronochrome, Iris prints, Polaroids, and silver photogravure. Examples of art history references include the use of bright color backgrounds in portraits that reference the work of Hans Holbein and the full-body frontal portraits that reference August Sander. Opie also depicts herself with her son in the traditional pose of Madonna and Child in &quot;Self Portrait/Nursing&quot; (2004).

Opie first came to be known with &quot;Being and Having&quot; (1991) and &quot;Portraits&quot; (1993–1997), which portray queer communities in Los Angeles and San Francisco. &quot;Being and Having&quot; looks at the outward portrayal of masculinity and is a reference to 17th-century Old Master portraiture. It conveyed strong ideals and perceptions among persons of the LGBT community, referencing gender, age, race, and identity; all constructed surrounding identity. This body of work similarly plays with performative aspects and play. These works read as iconography themselves.

The use of certain symbols in her works has allowed these portraits to sit separately from any of her previous works. For instance, the portrait &quot;Self Portrait/Pervert&quot; (1994) uses blood. The symbolism used in this work is recognized as a recurring statement for Opie, personally and allegorically. These images convey symbolic references to the celebration, embracing, and remembrance of the shift and personal relationship with one&#x27;s body. Opie&#x27;s use of blood is also seen in another work entitled &quot;Self-portrait/Cutting&quot; (1993)&quot;.&quot;

Opie&#x27;s earlier work relies more heavily on documentary photography as opposed to allegorical, yet still provides a stark relationship to her investigation and use of powerful iconography throughout the years.

A common social/political theme in her work is the concept of community. Opie has investigated aspects of community, making portraits of many groups including the LGBT community, surfers, and most recently, high school football players. Opie is interested in how identities are shaped by our surrounding architecture. Her work is informed by her identity as an out lesbian. Her works balance personal and political. Her assertive portraits bring queers to a forefront that is normally silenced by societal norms. Her work also explores how the idea of family varies between straight and LGBTQ communities. Opie highlights that LGBTQ households often base their families on close friendships and community, while straight families focus on their individual families.

Opie has referenced problems of visibility, where the reference to Renaissance paintings in her images declares the individuals as saints or characters. Opie&#x27;s portraits document, celebrate, and protect the community and individuals in which she photographs. In &quot;Portraits&quot; (1993–1997), she presents a variety of identities among the queer community, such as drag kings, cross-dressers, and F-to-M transexuals.

This Los Angeles-focused series sparked her ongoing project &quot;American Cities&quot; (1997–present), which is a collection of panoramic black-and-white photographs of quintessential American cities. This series is similar to an earlier work of hers, &quot;Domestic&quot; (1995–1998), which documented her 2-month RV road trip, portraying lesbian families engaging in everyday household activities across the country.

Drawing inspiration from the transgressive photography of Robert Mapplethorpe, Nan Goldin, and sex radicals, who provided a space for liberals and feminists, Opie has also explored controversial topics and imagery in her work. In her &quot;O&quot; folio—6 photogravures from 1999—Opie photographed S-M porn images she took earlier for &quot;On Our Backs,&quot; but as extreme close-ups.

In 2011, Opie photographed the home of the actress Elizabeth Taylor in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Taylor died during the project and never met Opie. Opie took 3,000 images for the project; 129 comprised the completed study. The resultant images were published as &quot;700 Nimes Road&quot;. &quot;Collector Daily&quot; noted the &quot;relentless femininity of Taylor&#x27;s taste&quot; in the images contrasted with Opie&#x27;s self-declared &quot;identity as a butch woman&quot; in Opie&#x27;s forward to &quot;700 Nimes Road&quot; and Opie&#x27;s &quot;status as an ordinary mortal&quot; in comparison to Taylor&#x27;s stardom.

Opie&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Modernist&quot; (2017), is a tribute to French filmmaker Chris Marker&#x27;s 1962 classic &quot;La Jetée.&quot; Composed of 800 still images, the film features Pig Pen (aka Stosh Fila)—a genderqueer performance artist—as the protagonist. &quot;The Modernist&quot; has been described as an ode to the city in which it takes place, Los Angeles, but it is also seen as questioning the legacy of modernism in America. In summary, the twenty-two-minute film is about an aggravated artist who just wants his own home as he has fallen in love with the architecture of Los Angeles. Being unable to purchase a place to live, the performance artist goes around burning down lovely architecture of LA.

===Teaching===
Opie&#x27;s teaching career began in 2001 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 2019, UCLA announced Opie as the university’s inaugural endowed chair in the art department, a position underwritten by a $2-million gift from philanthropists Lynda and Stewart Resnick. She has also taught photography workshops at Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village, CO and Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, MA.

<text>Claude of Valois (12 November 1547 – 21 February 1575) was a French princess as the second daughter of King Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici, and Duchess of Lorraine by marriage to Charles III, Duke of Lorraine.

==Biography==
Claude was born in Fontainebleau, but as she was believed to have been conceived at Chateau d&#x27;Anet, she was nicknamed as &#x27;Mademoiselle d&#x27;Anet&#x27; at court, a nickname that displeased her mother.

Claude was raised alongside her sister Elisabeth, and her future sister-in-law, Mary, Queen of Scots. The royal children were raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d&#x27;Humières and his wife Françoise d&#x27;Humières, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers.

Claude was victim of the unhealthy traits that Catherine appeared to pass on to all her children with the exception of Marguerite, and suffered from a hunchback and a club foot, and during her childhood she was frequently vulnerable to various diseases.

On 19 January 1559, at the age of 11, she married Charles III, Duke of Lorraine in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. The marriage was arranged as a symbolic union of peace between France and Lorraine, after Charles III had spent his childhood as a hostage at the French royal court, and completed after the Treaty of Chateau-Cambresis. Claude departed to Lorraine with her spouse in late 1559, shortly before the departure of her sister Elisabeth to Spain and her aunt Marguerite to Savoy.

===Duchess of Lorraine===
The relationship between Claude and Charles III was described as a happy one. Claude was a favorite of her mother, who occasionally visited her in Lorraine, visits described as rare occasions of private family gatherings in the life of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, who enjoyed seeing her grandchildren by Claude and also liked her son-in-law Charles very much. Catherine de&#x27; Medici was, for example, present in Bar-le-Duc for the splendid baptism of Claude&#x27;s firstborn son Henry, along with her younger children.

In 1570, Margaret of Valois wrote to her sister for help. For some time, their mother and brother, the Duke of Anjou, had come to believe that there was a romance between Margôt and Henry of Guise, nicknamed &quot;le Balagré&quot; (&quot;Scarface&quot;) whose family the Valois distrusted and disliked. Claude arranged the marriage of the Duke of Guise to the Princess of Porcien, and mediated for her family members, explaining to her mother that the supposed romance between Margôt and Navarre was nothing more than a vicious lie invented to discredit her.

Claude attended the wedding between Henry of Navarre and her sister Margaret of Valois in Paris in August 1572. On her way there, she had been ill and cared for by her mother in Chalons, which was the reason why Catherine de&#x27; Medici had been absent from the royal court during the border attack of Jean de Genlis near the Spanish Netherlands in July, which was used by Admiral Coligny to attempt to convince Charles IX to declare war on Spain.

On the evening of the Massacre, Claude was evidently informed that a massacre was to take place against the groom of her sister and his followers, and Margaret of Valois described how Claude had tears in her eyes and tried to stop her from leaving their mother&#x27;s chamber, when Margaret was about to retire to the chamber of her spouse. Claude took Margaret&#x27;s arm and begged her not to leave: she was contradicted by their mother, who warned Claude not to tell Margaret anything. Claude told their mother that it was not right to send Margaret to be &quot;sacrificed&quot;, as she would risk becoming a target, but Catherine de&#x27; Medici replied to Claude that Margaret would be safe if God wished it, that it would arouse suspicion if she did not go, and then told Margaret to leave, upon which Claude cried. After the massacre started, one of the courtiers of Navarre, de Leran, broke into the bedchamber of Margaret and begged her to save him from the captain of the Guards, M. de Nancay, who gave her the man&#x27;s life, and then escorted her to the chamber of Claude, where she was given refuge during the massacre.

During the last of her frequent visits to the French court, her brother the king gave her the gift of &quot;the ransoms of Guyenne, which came from the confiscations that took place there&quot;, and in turn gave one of the ransoms to Jeanne de Dampierre when asked. 

Brantôme gave the following description of her: 
:&quot;In her beauty she resembled her mother, in her knowledge and kindness she resembled her aunt; and the people of Lorraine found her ever kind as long as she lived, as I myself have seen when I went to that country; and after her death they found much to say of her. In fact, by her death that land was filled with regrets, and M. de Lorraine mourned her so much that, though he was young when widowed of her, he would not marry again, saying he could never find her like, though could he do so he would remarry, not being disinclined. [...] In short, she was a true daughter of France, having good mind and ability, which she proved by seconding wisely and ably her husband, M. de Lorraine, in the government of his seigneuries and principalities.&quot; 

Claude died in childbirth in 1575 at the age of 27. Brantôme wrote that she &quot;died in child-bed, through the appetite of an old midwife of Paris, a drunkard, in whom she had more faith than in any other.&quot;

==Children==

Claude and her husband had nine children:

<text>The House of Palaiologos ( Palaiologoi; , ; female version Palaiologina; ), also found in English-language literature as Palaeologus or Palaeologue, was a Byzantine Greek noble family that rose to power and produced the last and longest-ruling dynasty in the history of the Byzantine Empire. Their rule as Byzantine emperors lasted almost two hundred years, from 1259 to the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

The origins of the family are unclear. Their own medieval origin stories ascribed them an ancient and prestigious origin in ancient Roman Italy, descended from some of the Romans that had accompanied Constantine the Great to Constantinople upon its foundation in 330. It is more likely that they originated significantly later in Anatolia since the earliest known member of the family, possibly its founder, Nikephoros Palaiologos, served as a commander there in the second half of the 11th century. Over the course of the 12th century, the Palaiologoi were mostly part of the military aristocracy, not recorded as occupying any administrative political offices, and they frequently intermarried with the then ruling Komnenos family, increasing their prestige. When Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Palaiologoi fled to the Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine successor state ruled by the Laskaris family, where they continued to play an active role and occupied many offices of high rank.

In 1259, Michael VIII Palaiologos became co-emperor to the young John IV Laskaris through a coup and in 1261, following the recapture of Constantinople from the Latin Empire, John IV was deposed and blinded. Michael&#x27;s successors ruled the Byzantine Empire at its weakest point in history, and much of the Palaiologan period was a time of political and economic decline, partly due to external enemies such as the Bulgarians, Serbs and Ottoman Turks, and partly due to frequent civil wars between members of the Palaiologos family. By the beginning of the 15th century, the emperors had lost any real power, with the empire effectively having become a client state to the new Ottoman Empire. Their rule of the empire continued until 1453 when Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople and the final Palaiologan emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, died in the city&#x27;s defense. During their rule as emperors, the Palaiologoi were not well-liked by their subjects, mostly on account of their religious policy. The repeated attempts by the emperors to reunite the Greek Orthodox Church with the Roman Catholic Church, and thus place the Byzantine church in submission under the Papacy, was viewed as heresy and treason. Though Constantine XI died in communion with Rome (and thus as a &quot;heretic&quot;), his death in battle against the Ottomans, defending Constantinople, made the Greeks and the Orthodox church remember him as a hero, redeeming popular opinion of the dynasty as a whole. The role of the Palaiologoi as the final Christian dynasty to rule over Greek lands also accorded them a more positive remembrance among Greeks during the period of Ottoman rule.

The last certain members of the imperial line of the Palaiologoi died out in the 16th century, but female-line descendants survive to the present day. A cadet branch in Italy, the Palaeologus-Montferrat, ruled the March of Montferrat until 1536 and died out in 1566. Because the family was extensive before it produced emperors, the name Palaiologos was legitimately held not only by nobles part of the actual imperial dynasty. As a result, many Byzantine refugees who fled to Western Europe in the aftermath of Constantinople&#x27;s fall possessed the name and in order to earn prestige, some fabricated closer links to the imperial family. The genealogies of many supposedly surviving branches of the imperial dynasty have readily been dismissed as fantasy by modern researchers. Various lineages of non-imperial Palaialogoi, whose relation to the medieval Palaiologoi and each other are unclear, survived into the modern period and thousands of people, particularly in Greece, still have the last name Palaiologos, or variants thereof, today.

== Origin ==

The origins of the Palaiologos family are unclear. According to several later oral traditions, the family had originated in Italy, supposedly in the city of Viterbo. As per this version, the family name Palaiologos (&quot;Palaios logos&quot;, &quot;old word&quot;) was a Greek translation of &quot;vetus verbum&quot;, a dubious etymology of Viterbo. Such stories were popularized by later obscure Palaiologoi who had settled in northern Italy and were tempted to invent an ancestral link with the last Byzantine Emperors. Another tale maintained that the ancestors of Palaiologoi were among the Roman patricians who traveled to Constantinople accompanying Constantine the Great when the city was founded and designated as the Roman Empire&#x27;s new capital in 330. This origin story is similar to the traditions of other Byzantine noble families, such as the Doukas or Phokas clans, who also used stories of ancient Roman descent to bolster their prestige and somewhat legitimize their claims to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, the Roman Empire&#x27;s medieval continuation. 

In contrast to these ancient and prestigious origin stories, the Palaiologoi probably actually originated relatively late in Anatolia, possibly in the Anatolic Theme. The etymology of their family name was believed to be &quot;ragman&quot; by Soviet-American Byzantinist Alexander Kazhdan, possibly referencing humble origins, whereas the French Byzantinist Jean-François Vannier believes the correct etymology to be &quot;antique collector&quot;. The earliest known member of the family, possibly its founder, was Nikephoros Palaiologos, commander (possibly &quot;doux&quot;) of the Theme of Mesopotamia in the second half of the 11th century, in the reign of Emperor Michael VII Doukas. Nikephoros supported the revolt of Nikephoros III Botaneiates against Michael VII, but his son, George Palaiologos, married Anna Doukaina and thus supported the Doukas family and later Alexios I Komnenos, Anna&#x27;s brother-in-law, against Botaneiates. George served as the &quot;doux&quot; of Dyrrhachium in the reign of Alexios I and was accorded the title of &quot;kouropalates&quot;.

In the 12th century, the Palaiologoi were mainly recorded as members of the military aristocracy, not occupying any administrative political offices. They are recorded numerous times as donors to monasteries, and intermarried several times with the Komnenos dynasty during its rule over the Byzantine Empire (1081–1185). When the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade took Constantinople in 1204 and overthrew the Byzantine Empire in favor of the new, Catholic, Latin Empire, the Palaiologoi followed Theodore I Laskaris to the Empire of Nicaea, where they played an active role and continued to occupy offices of high rank. Andronikos Palaiologos, father of the later emperor Michael VIII, was proclaimed &quot;megas domestikos&quot; (commander-in-chief), probably by Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes.

The Palaiologoi&#x27;s many marriages with prominent Byzantine families was reflected in their choice of surnames, with earlier members of the imperial dynasty using the surnames of several of the previous ruling dynasties to reinforce their legitimacy. For instance, Michael VIII Palaiologos&#x27;s full name was &quot;Michael Komnenos Doukas Angelos Palaiologos&quot;.

== Imperial line ==
=== Path to the throne ===

Michael Palaiologos, born in 1223, was the son of Andronikos Palaiologos, &quot;megas domestikos&quot; in the Empire of Nicaea. Through the preceding century or so of Palaiologan marriages to other imperial families, his ancestry could be traced back to the three most recent dynasties that had ruled the empire before the Fourth Crusade (Doukas, Komnenos and Angelos). In his youth, Michael had served as the governor of the towns of Melnik and Serres in Thrace, and though he and his family were distinguished among the aristocracy, he was frequently mistrusted by the ruling Laskaris dynasty. In 1253, Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes accused him of plotting against the throne, though Michael escaped the accusation without punishment following a trial by ordeal of holding a red-hot iron. Though Michael continued to be mistrusted even after this, he married John III&#x27;s grandniece Theodora Vatatzaina and was appointed as the &quot;megas konostaulos&quot; of the Latin mercenaries employed by the empire.

After John III&#x27;s death in 1254, Michael briefly took service with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, frequent enemies of the empire, and from 1256 to 1258 he was the commander of the Christian mercenaries fighting for the Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II. John III&#x27;s son and successor, Theodore II Laskaris, recalled Michael in 1258 and after they had exchanged guarantees of safety and oaths of loyalty, Michael returned to service within the empire. Theodore II died in that same year and was succeeded by his eight-year-old son John IV Laskaris. Just a few days after Theodore&#x27;s death, Michael led a coup against the bureaucrat George Mouzalon, who had been appointed regent by Theodore II. Michael seized the guardianship of the child emperor and was invested with the titles of &quot;megas doux&quot; and &quot;despotes&quot;. On 1 January 1259, Michael was proclaimed as co-emperor at Nymphaion, probably without John IV being present.

On 25 July 1261, Nicene forces under general Alexios Strategopoulos recaptured Constantinople from the Latin Empire, restoring the city to Byzantine rule after almost sixty years in foreign hands. After the recapture of the capital and the restoration of the Byzantine Empire, Michael took care to be crowned emperor in Hagia Sophia, as Byzantine emperors had been before the city was lost to the crusaders. John IV, the last representative of the imperial Laskaris dynasty, was pushed aside in order to consolidate the Palaiologos family on the throne. On John IV&#x27;s eleventh birthday, 25 December 1261, the boy was deposed, blinded and confined to a monastery.&#x27; Once news of the act, the blinding of not only the legitimate emperor, but an underage boy, got out, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Arsenios Autoreianos, excommunicated Michael. The emperor&#x27;s excommunication was not lifted until nine years into his reign, upon the appointment of Patriarch Joseph I.&#x27; The blinding of John IV was a stain on the Palaiologan dynasty. In 1284, Michael&#x27;s son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos visited the blinded and then 33-year-old John IV during a journey in Anatolia, hoping to demonstrate his disapproval with his father&#x27;s actions.

=== Civil war and disintegration ===

The Palaiologoi ruled Byzantium at its weakest point in history, and the empire underwent significant economical and political decline. Even in this state, the empire, famous for its frequent civil wars, was unable to stay united. In 1320, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos attempted to disinherit his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos, despite the death of Andronikos II&#x27;s son, heir and co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos (Andronikos III&#x27;s father). Andronikos III secured the support of a significant number of the aristocracy and a period of civil war, not ended until 1328, ensued. Although Andronikos III was ultimately victorious and Andronikos II was deposed, the empire was damaged economically and for the first time, foreign states such as Bulgaria and Serbia had appeared as significant regulating factors in imperial dynastic disputes (joining opposite sides of the civil war).

When Andronikos III died in 1341, his underage son John V Palaiologos inherited the throne. Disputes between John V&#x27;s mother Anna of Savoy and the Patriarch John XIV on one side and Andronikos III&#x27;s friend and &quot;megas domestikos&quot; John Kantakouzenos on the other led to a new and devastating civil war, lasting until 1347 and won by John Kantakouzenos, who became senior co-emperor as John VI. The weakening of Byzantium as a result of the civil war allowed Stefan Dušan of Serbia to invade Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus in 1346–1348, creating the Serbian Empire. In the meantime, John VI Kantakouzenos attempted to consolidate his own dynasty on the imperial throne, marrying his daughter Helena to John V and proclaiming his son Matthew Kantakouzenos as co-emperor. Clearly intending to usurp the throne, a new series of civil wars from 1352 to 1357 were eventually won by John V, deposing the Kantakouzenoi. In 1382, the Kantakouzenoi were also driven out of the Morea (the modern-day Peloponnese) and John V&#x27;s son Theodore was placed to govern it as the semi-independent Despot of the Morea, an important victory as the region was quickly becoming the most important Byzantine province. The Byzantine civil wars, and the collapse of Stefan Dušan&#x27;s Serbian Empire following his death in 1355, had allowed the Ottoman Turks to expand almost unopposed through the Balkans and in the second half of the 14th century, the empire passed almost without a fight under Ottoman sovereignty, forced to pay tribute and offer military aid if needed.

In 1373, John V&#x27;s son and heir Andronikos IV Palaiologos rebelled against his father in an attempt to seize the throne, instigating a fourth series of Palaiologan civil wars. John V was initially victorious, imprisoning and disinheriting Andronikos IV and appointing a younger son, Manuel II Palaiologos, as his successor instead. However, Andronikos eventually escaped from prison and successfully took the throne in 1376 with aid from Genoa, imprisoning his father and his younger brother. John V retook the throne in 1379 but reached an agreement with Andronikos in 1381, wherein Andronikos was to succeed him as emperor, passing over Manuel. Andronikos died in 1385 and his son, John VII Palaiologos briefly managed to usurp the throne in 1390. Following this, Manuel II was firmly established as John V&#x27;s successor, becoming senior emperor upon John&#x27;s death in 1391.

Though most of the Palaiologan era was defined by decline and war, it was also an age of cultural flourishing, beginning in the late 13th century. Advances in science and the arts, referred to as the Palaiologan Renaissance, lasted throughout the dynasty&#x27;s rule, encouraged by the efforts of some emperors such as Andronikos II and Manuel II.

=== Last emperors of Byzantium ===

By the 15th century, the Byzantine emperors had lost any real power, with the Ottoman sultans increasingly becoming the real regulators of political matters within the empire. Despite their &quot;de facto&quot; submission under the Ottomans, the Byzantines continued to act with hostility against them. In 1394, Manuel II ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, who responded by besieging Constantinople. Bayezid&#x27;s siege lasted for more than a decade, with Western aid through the Crusade of Nicopolis (1396) failing to stop the sultan. The situation was so dire that Manuel left Constantinople to travel around Western Europe asking for further aid against the Ottomans, visiting Italy, France and England. Ultimately, the siege was resolved peacefully by Manuel through signing a peace treaty with Bayezid&#x27;s son and successor, Mehmed I, in 1403, which among other things returned the city of Thessaloniki, captured by the Ottomans in 1387, to Byzantine rule.

There was peace between the Palaiologans and the Ottomans until 1421, when Mehmed I died and Manuel retired from state affairs, to pursue scholarly and religious interests. Manuel&#x27;s son, John VIII Palaiologos, co-emperor since before 1416, ignored the fragile peace with the Ottomans and supported Mustafa Çelebi, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, in a rebellion against Mehmed I&#x27;s successor Murad II. Murad defeated Mustafa&#x27;s rebellion and besieged Constantinople in 1422, though the Byzantines successfully repulsed him. Even during the final decades of the Byzantine Empire, the Palaiologoi often found it difficult to cooperate with each other. During Manuel II&#x27;s reign, John VIII and the younger son Constantine appear to have got on well with each other, but the relations between Constantine and the younger brothers Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly.

Through most of John VIII&#x27;s reign, Constantine and Thomas ruled as Despots of the Morea, with Demetrios governing a stretch of land in Thrace. Demetrios was unhappy with his subordinate position and assaulted Constantinople in 1442, with Ottoman help, in an attempt to seize the city and become emperor himself. John VIII, aided by Constantine, successfully repulsed this attack and Demetrios was briefly imprisoned as punishment. After John VIII&#x27;s death in June 1448, the candidates for the throne were brothers Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. To avoid infighting, their mother Helena Dragaš decided that Constantine was to be the next emperor. Constantine XI Palaiologos&#x27;s rise to the throne was also accepted by Murad II, who by now had to be consulted for any appointments.

Constantine XI&#x27;s reign would prove to be brief. Murad II&#x27;s young son and successor, Mehmed II, who became sultan in 1451, was obsessed with the idea of conquering Constantinople. In an effort to extort money from Mehmed, Constantine implicitly threatened to release Orhan Çelebi, Mehmed&#x27;s cousin and the only other known living member of the Ottoman dynasty (and as such a potential rival to Mehmed), who was held prisoner in Constantinople. The ill-advised threat gave Mehmed a &quot;casus belli&quot; and late in 1451, preparations were already underway for a new Ottoman siege of Constantinople. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, now governed by Thomas and Demetrios, Mehmed II sent one of his generals, Turahan Bey (who had raided the Morea twice before) to devastate the peninsula. Constantine also sent desperate pleas for aid to Western Europe, though little help ever arrived. After a 53-day long siege, the city finally fell to the Ottomans on 29 May 1453. Constantine XI died fighting in its defense.

=== After the fall of Constantinople ===

In the aftermath of Constantinople&#x27;s fall, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI&#x27;s relatives would secure support and return to reclaim the empire. However, it soon became apparent Constantine&#x27;s closest relatives, his brothers in the Morea, represented little more than a nuisance to Mehmed II and they were thus allowed to keep their titles and lands as Ottoman vassals. Under their rule, the Morea was transformed into somewhat of a Byzantine government-in-exile, as Byzantine refugees from Constantinople and elsewhere fled to their courts, some even wishing to proclaim Demetrios, the elder brother, as Constantine&#x27;s successor and the new Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans. The brothers were divided in their policies. Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire whereas Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had more or less given up hope of Christian aid from the West and believed it to be best to placate the Turks.

In January 1459, rivalry between the brothers broke out into civil war as Thomas, with the aid of some of the Albanian lords in the Morea, seized a series of fortresses held by Demetrios. The ongoing civil war, and the possibility that Thomas could receive aid from the West since he had proclaimed the war against his brother as a holy war against the Muslims, caused Mehmed to invade the Morea in 1460. Mehmed was victorious and annexed the region directly into the Ottoman Empire, ending Palaiologan rule in Greece. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight and Thomas escaped into exile. Demetrios lived in the Ottoman Empire for the rest of his life, dying in 1470. His only child, his daughter Helena, never married the sultan nor entered the sultan&#x27;s harem, possibly because the sultan feared that she would poison him. She predeceased her father, dying in 1469.
Thomas had four children; Helena, Zoe, Andreas and Manuel. Helena had already been married to Lazar Branković, the Despot of Serbia, but the three younger children, and Thomas&#x27;s wife Catherine Zaccaria, and a retinue of other refugees, accompanied him as he escaped to the Venetian-held island of Corfu. The local authorities on Corfu were not eager to house the despot out of fear of provoking the Ottomans, so Thomas soon left the island and travelled to Rome, hoping to convince Pope Pius II of calling for a crusade against the Ottomans. Though Pius II was eager to go through with the idea, and Thomas rode around Italy in the hopes of drumming up support for the venture, no crusade materialized this time either. Thomas died on 12 May 1465 and shortly thereafter Zoe, Andreas and Manuel arrived in Rome.

In Rome, the three children were taken care of by Cardinal Bessarion, also a Byzantine refugee. In 1472, according to Bessarion&#x27;s plans, Zoe (whose name was later changed to Sophia) was married to Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow. As the oldest son, Andreas was recognized by the Papacy as Thomas&#x27;s heir and the rightful Despot of the Morea. From the 1480s onwards, Andreas also claimed the title &quot;Imperator Constantinopolitanus&quot; (&#x27;Emperor of Constantinople&#x27;). Some Byzantine refugees, such as historian George Sphrantzes, recognized Andreas as the rightful heir of the old emperors. Andreas and Manuel soon faced financial problems, with the pension once provided to their father having been split between the two of them and constantly cut back by the Papacy. Andreas attempted to sell his claims to various Byzantine titles to earn money, but since Manuel did not have any claims to sell (as he was the second son), he instead travelled around Europe hoping to enter into the service of some noble. After not receiving any satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised the establishment in Rome by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and presenting himself before Sultan Mehmed II. The sultan generously received him and Manuel stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life.

Andreas died poor in Rome in 1502. Whether he had any children is uncertain. It is possible that a Constantine Palaiologos, employed in the Papal Guard and dead in 1508 was his son. According to Russian sources, he might also have had a daughter, Maria Palaiologina, who married a Russian prince. A Fernando Palaiologos, referred to as the &quot;son of the Despot of the Morea&quot; by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, in 1499 might also have been a son of Andreas. Andreas&#x27;s brother Manuel died in Constantinople at some point during the reign of Mehmed II&#x27;s son and successor Bayezid II (1481–1512). Manuel had two sons; John Palaiologos, who died young, and Andreas, probably named after Manuel&#x27;s brother. Manuel&#x27;s son Andreas converted to Islam and might have served as an Ottoman court official. He is last attested in the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566) and is not believed to have had children of his own. Thus, the documented male line of the imperial branch of the House of Palaiologos probably went extinct at some point in the early 16th century.

== Other lineages ==
=== Palaeologus-Montferrat ===
When the Byzantines reconquered Constantinople in 1261 under Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Papacy suffered a loss of prestige and endured severe damage to its spiritual authority. For 57 years, Constantinople had been under Catholic rule through the Latin Empire and now the easterners had once more asserted their right not only to the position of Roman emperor but also to a church independent of the one centered in Rome. The Popes in the immediate aftermath of the Latin Empire&#x27;s fall pursued a policy of attempting to assert their religious authority over the Byzantine Empire. Some Western pretenders who wished to restore the Latin Empire, such as the King of Sicily, Charles of Anjou, periodically enjoyed Papal support, and several Popes considered the idea of calling for a new crusade against Constantinople to once more impose Catholic rule.

Michael VIII succeeded in achieving a union of the Catholic and Orthodox churches at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, legitimizing him and his successors as rulers of Constantinople in the eyes of the West. Michael&#x27;s son and successor Andronikos II wished to further legitimize the rule of the Palaiologan dynasty. Other crusader states had been formed in Greece as a result of the Fourth Crusade, notably the Kingdom of Thessalonica, which had been ruled by the Aleramici family of Montferrat. In an effort to rid himself of the threat that an Aleramici pretender might launch an invasion and attempt to seize Thessaloniki in the future, Andronikos married Yolande of Montferrat in 1284, bringing her dynastic claims to Thessaloniki into his own family line. Since Yolande was second-in-line to the throne of the March of Montferrat, the marriage had the unexpected result of creating the possibility that a Byzantine prince might inherit Montferrat. When Yolande&#x27;s brother, John I of Montferrat, died without children in 1305, Montferrat legitimately passed to Yolande and her children.

The Byzantine aristocracy were less than eager of sending one of Andronikos II&#x27;s sons to claim Montferrat. That a Byzantine prince, born in the purple, would be sent to live among, and rule over, Latins, was bad enough but there were also fears that he and his descendants might become &#x27;Latinized&#x27; and that the Italians, as a result of the Montferrat inheritance, could launch an invasion in the future in hopes of placing a Catholic Palaiologos on the Byzantine throne. In the end, Andronikos II&#x27;s fourth son (in order to not jeopardize the line of succession), Theodore, was chosen to travel to Montferrat, arriving there in 1306. Byzantine fears of Latinization became true; Theodore converted to Catholicism and on his visits to Constantinople, Theodore shocked the Byzantines with his shaven face and Western customs.

Theodore&#x27;s descendants, the Palaeologus-Montferrat family, ruled at Montferrat until the 16th century, though they were sometimes given Greek names, such as Theodore and Sophia, most of the Palaiologan Marquises of Montferrat paid little attention to affairs in the eastern Mediterranean. The only Marquis to seriously consider using his Byzantine connection was Theodore&#x27;s son, John II of Montferrat, who wished to take advantage of the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, between Andronikos II&#x27;s great-grandson John V and John VI Kantakouzenos, in order to invade the empire and conquer Thessaloniki. In his will from 1372, John II claimed that Andronikos II&#x27;s deposition in 1328 by his grandson Andronikos III (John V&#x27;s father) had been unlawful and thus disqualified Andronikos III and all his heirs from the legitimate line of succession to the throne of Byzantium. John II also pointed out that since Andronikos II had disinherited Andronikos III, John II was thus the rightful emperor as the only true heir to Andronikos II. John II even petitioned the Papacy to recognize his claims to Thessaloniki and to the empire, and to help him conquer them. An expedition to &quot;recover&quot; these territories was never organized.

The final Palaeologus Marquis, John George, Marquis of Montferrat, died in 1533 and rule of Montferrat was then given to Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The last female member, Margaret Paleologa, married to Federico II, died in 1566, rendering the Montferrat cadet branch extinct. Her and Federico II&#x27;s descendants, with the Gonzaga name, ruled Montferrat until they were supplanted by the House of Savoy, which had also intermarried with the Palaeologus-Montferrat family in the past, in the 18th century. The name &quot;Montferrato-Paleologo&quot; is recorded on the Greek island of Cephalonia until the 17th century, though it is uncertain how they were connected to the Italian family. A modern Italian family, called the Paleologo-Oriundi, claim that they descend from Flaminio, an illegitimate son of John George.

=== Branches of unclear descent ===
The probable extinction of the senior branch of the imperial Palaiologos family at some point in the 16th century did little to stop individuals in various parts of Europe from claiming descent from the old imperial dynasty. The family name &quot;Palaiologos&quot; had been relatively widespread in the Byzantine Empire, and the family had been quite extensive before a branch of it acceded to the imperial throne. Many of the non-imperial Byzantine Palaiologoi were part of the nobility and served as generals or powerful landowners. In addition to the non-imperial Palaiologoi that were descendants of older collateral lines, Byzantine genealogy is also made complicated by the fact that it was common in Byzantium to adopt the family name of one&#x27;s spouse or mother, if the name was more prestigious.

Many Byzantine nobles found themselves in Constantinople in 1453, fighting against the Ottomans in their final attack. Some, such as Theophilos Palaiologos, died in the battle, whereas others were taken prisoner and executed. Nobles that could escape mostly did, many fleeing to the Morea where they had estates. There, they faced a dilemma. The Byzantine Empire had fallen and the rulers of the Morea, Thomas and Demetrios, appeared more interested in their own rivalry than in organizing resistance against the Ottomans. As such, many of them escaped into Western Europe either before or after the Morea fell in 1460.

Many Byzantine refugees, though unrelated to the emperors, legitimately bore the name Palaiologos due to the extensive nature of the family. Because the name could lend whoever bore it prestige (as well as possible monetary support), many refugees fabricated closer links to the imperial dynasty. Many Western rulers were conscious of their failure to prevent Byzantium&#x27;s fall and welcomed these men at their courts. The refugees were helped in that many in Western Europe would have been unaware of the intricacies of Byzantine naming customs; to Western Europeans, the name Palaiologos meant the imperial dynasty. Though such Palaiologoi, imperial or not, were mainly concentrated in northern Italy, such as in Pesaro, Viterbo, or Venice, other Greek refugees travelled across Europe, many ending up in Rome, Naples, Milan, Paris or in various cities in Spain.

A special link between the family of Palaiologos and the city of Viterbo was forged based on a specious etymological connection of the Latin &quot;Vetus verbum&quot; (Viterbo) and the Greek &quot;Palaios logos&quot;. This link gave a certain degree of prominence to several obscure Palaiologoi who had settled in Italy during the late Middle Ages, and was held as an argument that the family had its roots in the city. Theodore Spandounes mentions a story, according to which the family, originally Romans who arrived in Constantinople in the 4th century, moved to Italy during the exarchate and one of them married in Viterbo. Later, a soldier of the family was said to have come from Viterbo to Greece in the aid of the Lascarid Emperors, where he married and had his son, allegedly the future Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (Michael&#x27;s true parents were Andronikos and Theodora who had lived in the Empire of Nicaea).

&#x27;Palaiologos&#x27; as a last name continues to survive to this day in various variants. Common versions of the last name used today include the standard &quot;Palaiologos&quot; (approximately 1,800 people, most common in Greece), &quot;Palaiologou&quot; (approximately 2,000 people, again most common in Greece), &quot;Paleologos&quot; (approximately 500 people, most common in the United States but present worldwide) and &quot;Paleologo&quot; (approximately 250 people, most common in Italy). These modern Palaiologoi cannot be confidently proven to descend from the imperial dynasty, or the medieval family which produced it.&#x27; Because people with the name live throughout the world and might not even be related in the first place, creating an all-encompassing modern Palaiologos genealogy is next to impossible. It is possible that many of the modern people who bear the name are descended from wealthy Greeks in the Ottoman period, who commonly assumed Byzantine surnames and claimed descent from the famous noble houses of their Byzantine past.&#x27; Some might be genuine descendants of the imperial family as several of the imperial Palaiologoi are recorded as having had illegitimate children; for instance, Theodore II, Despot of the Morea, is known to have had several illegitimate children.

==== Paleologus of Pesaro ====
The Paleologus family in Pesaro, attested from the early 16th century onwards, claimed descent from &#x27;John Palaiologos&#x27;, a purported third son of Thomas Palaiologos. Their genealogy mainly derives from the tombstone of Theodore Paleologus (d. 1636), which lists Theodore&#x27;s male-line ancestors five generations back, reaching Thomas.&#x27; With the sole exception of Thomas&#x27;s purported son John, the existence of the rest of Theodore&#x27;s immediate ancestors can be verified through records at Pesaro.&#x27; The earliest record of John&#x27;s existence other than Theodore&#x27;s tombstone are the writings of the Greek scholar Leo Allatius, who wrote in 1648, too late for his works to be considered independent evidence. Allatius was the keeper of the Vatican Library and would have had access to its vast collection of books and records and might have deduced his findings from there.&#x27; As such, it is possible that Allatius had access to earlier documents, now lost, which would have proven the legitimacy of the Pesaro line. Allatius gives the sons of Thomas as &quot;Andrea, Manuele and Ioanne&quot;.&#x27; It would be difficult to explain why Allatius, a respected scholar, would simply make up a member of an ancient dynasty.&#x27; The absence of any mentions of John Palaiologos in contemporary sources means that the Paleologus family&#x27;s status as genuine male-line descendants of the last few Byzantine emperors can not be proven, but it is not impossible. None of their own contemporaries appear to have doubted their imperial descent.&#x27;

In 1578, the members of the family living in Pesaro were embroiled in a scandal as brothers Leonidas and Scipione Paleologus, and their nephew Theodore, were arrested for attempted murder.&#x27; What happened to Scipione is not known, but Leonidas was executed. On account of his young age, Theodore was exiled from Pesaro rather than executed.&#x27; Following his exile, Theodore established himself as an assassin and appears to have garnered an impressive reputation.&#x27; In 1599, he entered into the service of Henry Clinton, the Earl of Lincoln, in England.&#x27; Theodore lived in England for the rest of his life and fathered six children,&#x27; whose fates were caught up in the English Civil War of 1642–1651. His son Ferdinand Paleologus, escaping the war, settled on the recently colonized island of Barbados in the Caribbean, where he became known as the &quot;Greek prince from Cornwall&quot; and owned a cotton or sugar plantation.&#x27;

Ferdinand died in 1670 and was survived only by his son, Theodore.&#x27; Theodore left Barbados to work as a privateer, serving aboard a ship called &quot;Charles II&quot;, and died at A Coruña, Spain in 1693.&#x27; Theodore had a son, who probably predeceased him,&#x27; and was survived only by a posthumous daughter, Godscall Paleologue, born in January 1694.&#x27; Nothing is known of Godscall&#x27;s life, the only record of her existence being her baptismal records. She was the last recorded member of the family and, if their claim to descend from the imperial dynasty was true, the last true heir of the Palaiologan emperors.

==== Paleologo of Venice ====

Because Venice was the only major non-Muslim power in the Eastern Mediterranean, it represented an appealing destination for Byzantine refugees as the empire fell. Numerous people with the last name Paleologus are recorded in Venice in the 15th and 16th centuries, many serving as &quot;stratioti&quot; (mercenary light-armed cavalrymen of Greek or Albanian origin). Venetian documents frequently refer to their &quot;strenuous&quot; prowess in service to the Venetian Republic. Venice had first become interested in hiring &quot;stratioti&quot; after witnessing the prowess of Greek and Albanian soldiers in the First Ottoman–Venetian War of 1463–1479.

The Venetian Palaiologoi were not related to the imperial family, but they might have been distant cousins. One of the earliest references to Palaiologoi in Venice is a 1479 Senate decision concerning Theodore Palaiologos, who had recently proven himself in a campaign in Friuli. Theodore had a well-documented career as a &quot;stratiote&quot;. Born in 1452, and probably originally from Mystras in the Morea, Theodore was originally a debt collector for the Ottomans in the Morea. In 1478, Theodore travelled to Venice with his father, Paul, and became a &quot;stratiote&quot;. For his merits in the service of Venice, Theodore was granted the island Cranae, though he later ceded it to another family. In 1495, Theodore partook in a siege of Novara and also partook in later battles in Savona and Cephalonia. Due to his knowledge of the Turkish language, Theodore also accompanied Venetian ambassadors in diplomatic missions to the Ottoman Empire, visiting Constantinople several times. He died in 1532, being buried in the Orthodox church of San Giorgio dei Greci.

Theodore had married Maria, a daughter of a man by the name Demetrios Kantakouzenos. That he could marry a genuine member of the noble Kantakouzenos family indicates that he held a certain noble status. Theodore was one of the key players in the Greek community in Venice, having helped the Greek refugees there achieve permission to construct the San Giorgio dei Greci church in the first place, and his family was highly regarded by the locals. Theodore&#x27;s descendants and relatives lived on in Venice and its territories long after his death. His nephew, Zuanne Paleologo, and two of Zuanne&#x27;s sons, died on Cyprus, fighting the Ottomans during the 1570 Siege of Nicosia in the Fourth Ottoman–Venetian War. The 1570 will of Demetri Paleologo, a son of Theodore, begins with &quot;Io Demetri Palleollogo, da Constantinopoli ...&quot;. Over a century had passed since Constantinople, a city Demetri had never seen, had fallen and yet he retained lingering dreams of the city.

A man by the name Andrea Paleologo Graitzas, attested in Venice in 1460, supposedly has living descendants, with numerous people with the last name Palaiologos (or variations thereof) living in Athens today claiming to descend from him.

==== In the Ottoman Empire ====

Some nobles with the last name Palaiologos remained in Ottoman Constantinople, and even prospered in the immediate post-conquest period. In the decades after 1453, Ottoman tax registers show a consortium of noble Greeks co-operating to bid for the lucrative tax farming district including Constantinople and the ports of western Anatolia. This group included names like &quot;Palologoz of Kassandros&quot; and &quot;Manuel Palologoz&quot;. This group stood in close contact with two powerful viziers, Mesih Pasha and Hass Murad Pasha, both of whom were reportedly nephews to Constantine XI Palaiologos and had been forced to convert to Islam after Constantinople&#x27;s fall, as well as with other converted scions of Byzantine and Balkan aristocratic families like Mahmud Pasha Angelović, forming what the Ottomanist Halil İnalcık termed a &quot;Greek faction&quot; at the court of Mehmed II.

==== Other claims of descent ====

Numerous people with the last name Palaiologos, living on the island of Syros in Greece, have historically claimed descent from a supposed son of Andronikos Palaiologos, one of Emperor Manuel II&#x27;s sons and Despot of Thessaloniki. Their descent is questionable since there is no surviving contemporary evidence that Andronikos had children. That Andronikos suffered from elephantiasis and epilepsy, and that he died at a young age, makes it unlikely that he married and had a son.

Another family which claims to descend from the old imperial dynasty are the Paleologu of Romania, claiming to be the descendants of an otherwise unattested son of Theodore II Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, called Emanuel Petrus (Manuel Petros in Greek). The Paleologu also live in Malta and France, one of the most famous members of the family being the French diplomat Maurice Paléologue, who in his lifetime repeatedly asserted his imperial descent.&#x27; The ancestry of the Paleologu can be traced to Greeks with the name Palaiologos, but not to the imperial family. In the 18th century, several Phanariots (members of prominent Greek families in the Fener quarter of Constantinople) were granted governing positions in the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (predecessors of Romania) by the Ottomans. The Phanariots sent to Wallachia and Moldavia included people with the last name Palaiologos, ancestors of the Paleologu family.&#x27;

Some Italian genealogies from the 17th century onwards ascribe further sons to Thomas Palaiologos, in addition to both Andreas, Manuel and the unverified John. Notably, these include a supposed older son called Rogerio or Ruggerio, supposedly born around 1430 and sent as a hostage to Alfonso the Magnanimous of Aragon and Naples. Supposedly, Rogerio was responsible for erecting the &quot;Spirito Santo&quot; church, which still stands, in Casalsottano, a hamlet of the Italian &quot;comune&quot; San Mauro Cilento.&#x27; Rogerio was supposedly survived by his two children John (Giovanni) and Angela.&#x27; Giovanni was supposedly granted Perito and Ostigliano in Salerno&#x27; and his descendants adopted the name &quot;Paleologo Mastrogiovanni&quot; (or just &quot;Mastrogiovanni&quot;) in his honour.&#x27; The Paleologo Mastrogiovanni family is an extant family in Italy, but their claimed family history mainly derives from oral tradition, with few documents supporting it. None of the documents have been authenticated and there are several issues with the overall reconstruction of events and descent.&#x27; Modern researchers overwhelmingly dismiss the existence of Rogerio as fantasy, given his clearly Italian first name, the unlikelihood of a potential imperial heir being kept as a hostage in Italy and that there are no mentions of such a figure in Byzantine records. The contemporary historian George Sphrantzes, who described the life of Thomas Palaiologos in detail, wrote on the birth of Andreas Palaiologos on 17 January 1453 that the boy was &quot;a continuator and heir&quot; of the Palaiologan lineage, a phrase which makes little sense if Andreas was not Thomas&#x27;s first-born son.&#x27;

== Legacy ==

During most of their tenure as Byzantine emperors, the Palaiologan dynasty was not well-liked by their subjects. Not only were the means the family had used to gain the throne grim, but their religious policy alienated many within the empire. The Palaiologan emperors aspired to reunite the Eastern Orthodox Church with the Catholic Church of Rome, to ensure legitimacy in the eyes of the West and in an attempt to secure aid against the many enemies of their empire. Michael VIII succeeded in a union at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, which formally reunited the churches after more than two centuries of schism. Michael VIII was taunted with the words &quot;you have become a Frank&quot;, which remains a term in Greek to taunt converts to Catholicism to this day. The union was passionately opposed by the Byzantine people and of Byzantine rulers not actually under Michael VIII&#x27;s control, such as John II Megas Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond, and Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus. Despite Michael VIII&#x27;s efforts, the union was disrupted in 1281, after just seven years, when he was excommunicated by Pope Martin IV. When Michael VIII died in 1282 he died condemned as a traitor and a heretic by his people, who saw him as someone who had bullied them into submission under the Church of Rome. He was denied the traditional funeral pomps of an Orthodox Emperor.

Though Michael&#x27;s successor Andronikos II quickly repudiated the Union of the Churches, many of the Palaiologan emperors worked to ensure its restoration. As the Ottoman Empire grew to encompass more and more Byzantine territory, emperors such as John V and Manuel II labored intensely to restore the union, much to the dismay of their subjects. At the Council of Florence in 1439, Emperor John VIII reaffirmed the Union in the light of imminent Turkish attacks on what little remained of his empire. To the Byzantine citizens themselves, the Union of the Churches, which to John VIII served as an assurance of a great western crusade against the Ottomans, was a death warrant for their empire. John VIII had betrayed their faith and as such their entire imperial ideology and world view. The promised crusade, the fruit of John VIII&#x27;s labor, ended only in disaster as it was defeated by the Turks at the Battle of Varna in 1444. In 1798, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Anthemus, wrote that the Ottoman Empire had been imposed by God himself as the supreme empire on Earth due to the heretical dealings of the Palaiologan emperors with Christians in the West.

There is no evidence that the final emperor, Constantine XI, ever repudiated the union achieved at Florence in 1439. Many of his subjects had chastised him as a traitor and heretic while he lived and he, like many of his predecessors before him, died in communion with the Church of Rome. Nevertheless, Constantine&#x27;s actions during the Fall of Constantinople and his death fighting the Turks redeemed the popular view of the Palaiologan dynasty. The Greeks forgot or ignored that Constantine had died a &quot;heretic&quot;, many considering him a martyr. In the eyes of the Orthodox church, Constantine&#x27;s death sanctified him and he died a hero. As Ottoman rule continued, many Greeks dreamed of a day when a new emperor would once more rule a sizeable Greek domain. Some even believed that Constantine XI would return to rescue them, that he was not actually dead but merely asleep, awaiting a call from the heavens to return and restore Christian control over Constantinople.

Beyond Constantine&#x27;s martyrdom, the Palaiologos dynasty had a lasting impact on the Greeks throughout the centuries of Ottoman rule, having been the last family to govern independent Greek lands. As late as the 19th century, after the Greek War of Independence had resulted in the creation of a new independent Greek state, the provisional government of liberated Greece sent a delegation to Western Europe in search of possible descendants of those imperial Palaiologoi that had escaped into exile. The delegation visited places in Italy where Palaiologoi were known to have resided and even came to Cornwall, where Theodore Paleologus had lived in the 17th century. Local tradition on Barbados has it that the delegation also sent a letter to the authorities on Barbados, inquiring if descendants of Ferdinand Paleologus still lived on the island. The letter supposedly requested that if that was the case, the head of the family should be provided with the means of returning to Greece, with the trip paid for by the Greek government. Ultimately, the delegation&#x27;s search was in vain and they found no living embodiments of their lost empire.

== Family tree ==
In order to conserve space, the family tree focuses on people of male-line descent, omitting many children and descendants of female members of the dynasty. Most marriages that did not produce children are also omitted. Emperors are indicated with bold text and women are indicated with italics. Dotted lines indicate illegitimate offspring. Family trees for related families (i.e. Doukas, Komnenos, Angelos, Kantakouzenos etc.) simplified, with multiple figures omitted, see their articles for more detailed charts. The family tree only follows the imperial branch of the family.

<doc id="989740" wikidata="Q1702335" url="?curid=989740" title="Gardner's syndrome">
<text>Gardner&#x27;s syndrome (also known as Gardner syndrome, familial polyposis of the colon, or familial colorectal polyposis) is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the colon together with tumors outside the colon. The extracolonic tumors may include osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas, as well as the occurrence of desmoid tumors in approximately 15% of affected individuals.

Desmoid tumors are fibrous tumors that usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. The countless polyps in the colon predispose to the development of colon cancer; if the colon is not removed, the chance of colon cancer is considered to be very significant. Polyps may also grow in the stomach, duodenum, spleen, kidneys, liver, mesentery, and small bowel. In a small number of cases, polyps have also appeared in the cerebellum. Cancers related to Gardner syndrome commonly appear in the thyroid, liver and kidneys. The number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon.

The syndrome was first described in 1951. There is no cure at this time, and in its more advanced forms, it is considered a terminal diagnosis with a life expectancy of 35–45 years; treatments are surgery and palliative care, although some chemotherapy has been tried with limited success.

==Cause==
Gardner syndrome is caused by mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC gene), located in chromosome 5q21 (band q21 on chromosome 5). This gene is also mutant in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a more common disease that also predisposes to colon cancer. Nuances in the understanding of genetics have caused some disorders to be split into multiple entities, while others merged into one genetic condition. After most of the second half of the 20th century, Gardner syndrome has been merged into FAP and is now considered simply a phenotypic subtype of FAP. FAP is defined by the development of hundreds or thousands of polyps in the colon. Gardner syndrome is set apart as a subtype because, in addition to colonic polyps, there are also extra-colonic growths (both malignant and benign). There are many terms used to describe &quot;APC-associated polyposis condition&quot; including FAP, attenuated FAP, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). There is a movement toward no longer using the terms Gardner Syndrome or Turcot Syndrome since both are part of the FAP spectrum. Gardner syndrome and Turcot syndrome are regarded primarily for historical interest.

==Genetics==
Gardner syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Typically, one parent has Gardner syndrome. Each of their children, male and female alike, are at 50% risk of inheriting the gene for Gardner syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Gardner syndrome consists of adenomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal tract, Gardner fibromas, desmoid tumors, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, lipomas, dental abnormalities, and periampullary carcinomas. The incidence of the syndrome is 1:14,025 with an equal sex distribution. It is determined by the autosomal dominant familial polyposis coli gene (APC) on chromosome 5.

Gardner syndrome can be identified based on oral findings, including multiple impacted and supernumerary teeth, multiple jaw osteomas that give a &quot;cotton-wool&quot; appearance to the jaws, as well as multiple odontomas, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), in addition to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon. Gardner syndrome is also associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and may manifest as aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) of the retroperitoneum.

Desmoid tumors arise most frequently from the aponeurosis of the rectus abdominal muscle of multiparous women. The extra-abdominal form is rare and desmoids of the breast may arise in the mammary gland or may occur as an extension of a lesion arising from the muscles of the chest wall. The incidence of mammary desmoid tumors is less than 0.2% of primary breast neoplasms. In Gardner&#x27;s syndrome, the incidence ranges from 4% to 17%. Desmoid tumors associated with Gardner&#x27;s syndrome have been shown to have an alteration of the β-catenin pathway and over express β-catenin.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Gardner Syndrome. Treatments focus on alleviating symptoms and reducing risk of cancer. Treatments for desmoid tumors may include surgery, NSAIDS, anti-estrogen medications, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

==Eponym==
The syndrome is named for Eldon J. Gardner (1909–1989), an American geneticist who first described it in 1951.

<doc id="989749" wikidata="Q334842" url="?curid=989749" title="Marvin Harris">
<text>Marvin Harris (August 18, 1927 – October 25, 2001) was an American anthropologist. He was born in Brooklyn, New York City. A prolific writer, he was highly influential in the development of cultural materialism and environmental determinism. In his work, he combined Karl Marx&#x27;s emphasis on the forces of production with Thomas Malthus&#x27;s insights on the impact of demographic factors on other parts of the sociocultural system.

Labeling demographic and production factors as infrastructure, Harris posited these factors as key in determining a society&#x27;s social structure and culture. After the publication of &quot;The Rise of Anthropological Theory&quot; in 1968, Harris helped focus the interest of anthropologists in cultural-ecological relationships for the rest of his career. Many of his publications gained wide circulation among lay readers.

Over the course of his professional life, Harris drew both a loyal following and a considerable amount of criticism. He became a regular fixture at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association, where he would subject scholars to intense questioning from the floor, podium, or bar. He is considered a generalist, who had an interest in the global processes that account for human origins and the evolution of human cultures.

In his final book, &quot;Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times,&quot; Harris argued that the political consequences of postmodern theory were harmful, a critique similar to those later developed by philosopher Richard Wolin and others.

==Early career==

Being born just before the Great Depression, Harris was poor during his childhood in Brooklyn. He entered the U.S. Army toward the end of the Second World War and used funding from the G.I. Bill to enter Columbia University along with a new generation of post-war American anthropologists. Harris was an avid reader who loved to spend hours at the race track and he eventually developed a complex mathematical betting system that was successful enough to provide support for his wife, Madelyn, and him during his years of graduate school.

Harris&#x27; early work was with his mentor, Charles Wagley, and his dissertation research in Brazil produced an unremarkable village study that carried on the Boasian descriptive tradition in anthropology—a tradition he would later denounce.

After graduation, Harris was given an assistant professorship at Columbia and, while undertaking fieldwork in Mozambique in 1957, Harris underwent a series of profound transformations that altered his theoretical and political orientations.

==Theoretical contributions==
Harris&#x27; earliest work began in the Boasian tradition of descriptive anthropological fieldwork, but his fieldwork experiences in Mozambique in the late 1950s caused him to shift his focus from ideological features of culture toward behavioral aspects. His 1969 history of anthropological thought, &quot;The Rise of Anthropological Theory&quot; critically examined hundreds of years of social thought with the intent of constructing a viable understanding of human culture that Harris came to call Cultural Materialism. The book, affectionately known as &quot;The RAT&quot; among graduate students, is a synthesis of classical and contemporary macrosocial theory.

Cultural materialism incorporated and refined Marx&#x27;s categories of superstructure and base. Harris modified and amplified such core Marxist concepts as means of production and exploitation, but Harris rejected two key aspects of Marxist thought: the dialectic, which Harris attributed to an intellectual vogue of Marx&#x27;s time; and unity of theory and practice, which Harris regarded as an inappropriate and damaging stance for social scientists. Harris also integrated Malthus&#x27; population theory into his research strategy as a major determinant factor in sociocultural evolution, which also contrasted with Marx&#x27;s rejection of population as a causal element.

According to Harris, the principal mechanisms by which a society exploits its environment are contained in a society&#x27;s infrastructure—the mode of production (technology and work patterns) and population (such as population characteristics, fertility and mortality rates). Since such practices are essential for the continuation of life itself, widespread social structures and cultural values and beliefs must be consistent with these practices. Since the aim of science, Harris writes: is the discovery of the maximum amount of order in its field of inquiry, priority for theory building logically settles upon those sectors under the greatest direct restraints from the givens of nature. To endow the mental superstructure [ideas and ideologies] with strategic priority, as the cultural idealists advocate, is a bad bet. Nature is indifferent to whether God is a loving father or a bloodthirsty cannibal. But nature is not indifferent to whether the fallow period in a swidden [slash and burn] field is one year or ten. We know that powerful restraints exist on the infrastructural level; hence it is a good bet that these restraints are passed on to the structural and superstructural components. (Harris 1979, 57)Harris made a critical distinction between emic and etic, which he refined considerably since its exposition in &quot;The Rise of Anthropological Theory&quot;. The terms &quot;emic&quot; and &quot;etic&quot; originated in the work of missionary-linguist Kenneth Pike, despite the latter&#x27;s conceptual differences with Harris&#x27; constructs. As used by Harris, emic meant those descriptions and explanations that are right and meaningful to an informant or subject, whereas etic descriptions and explanations are those used by the scientific community to germinate and force theories of sociocultural life. That is, emic is the participant&#x27;s perspective, whereas etic is the observer&#x27;s. Harris had asserted that both are in fact necessary for an explanation of human thought and behavior.

Harris&#x27; early contributions to major theoretical issues include his revision of biological surplus theory in obesity formation. He also became well known for formulating a materialist explanation for the treatment of cattle in religion in Indian culture. Along with Michael Harner, Harris is one of the scholars most associated with the suggestion that Aztec cannibalism was widespread and resulted from protein deficiency in their diet. An explanation appears in Harris&#x27; book &quot;Cannibals and Kings&quot;. Harris also invoked the human quest for animal protein to explain Yanomamo warfare, contradicting ethnographer Napoleon Chagnon’s sociobiological explanation involving innate male human aggressiveness.

Several other publications by Harris examine the cultural and material roots of dietary traditions in many cultures, including &quot;Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture&quot; (1975); &quot;Good to Eat: Riddles of Food and Culture&quot; (1998; originally titled &quot;The Sacred Cow and the Abominable Pig&quot;) and his co-edited volume, &quot;Food and Evolution: Toward a Theory of Human Food Habits&quot; (1987).

Harris&#x27; &quot;Why Nothing Works: The Anthropology of Daily Life&quot; (1981; originally titled &quot;America Now: the Anthropology of a Changing Culture&quot;) applies concepts from cultural materialism to the explanation of such social developments in late twentieth century United States as inflation, the entry of large numbers of women into the paid labor force, marital stability, and shoddy products.

His &quot;Our Kind: Who We Are, Where We&#x27;re From, Where We Are&quot; (1990) surveys the broad sweep of human physical and cultural evolution, offering provocative explanations of such subjects as human transsexualism and nontranssexualism and the origins of inequality. Finally, Harris&#x27; 1979 work, &quot;Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture&quot;, updated and re-released in 2001, offers perhaps the most comprehensive statement of cultural materialism. A separate article lists the many and diverse publications of Marvin Harris.

While Harris&#x27; contributions to anthropology are wide, it has been said that &quot;Other anthropologists and observers had almost as many opinions about Dr. Harris as he had about why people behave as they do.&quot; The &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine allegedly called him &quot;one of the most controversial anthropologists alive.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;a storm center in his field&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; accused him of &quot;overgeneralized assumptions&quot;. Harris could be an acerbic critic of other theories and frequently received return fire.

==Academic career==

Harris received both his MA and PhD degrees from Columbia University, the former in 1949 and the latter in 1953. He performed fieldwork in Brazil and Portuguese-speaking Africa before joining the faculty at Columbia. He eventually became chairman of the anthropology department at Columbia. During the Columbia student campus occupation of 1968, Harris was among the few faculty leaders who sided with the students when they were threatened and beaten by the police. During the 1960s and 1970s, he was a resident of Leonia in New Jersey.

Harris next joined the University of Florida anthropology department in 1981 and retired in 2000, becoming the Anthropology Graduate Research Professor Emeritus. Harris also served as the Chair of the General Anthropology Division of the American Anthropological Association.

Harris was the author of seventeen books. Two of his college textbooks, &quot;Culture, People, Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology&quot; and &quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot;, were published in seven editions. His research spanned the topics of race, evolution, and culture. He often focused on Latin America and Brazil, but also focused on the Islas de la Bahia, Ecuador, Mozambique, and India.

<text>Valleyfair is a amusement park in Shakopee, Minnesota, United States. Owned by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, the park opened in 1976 and features over 75 rides and attractions including eight roller coasters. Valleyfair also has a water park called Soak City which is included with the price of admission. Cedar Point and Valleyfair were the first two parks in the Cedar Fair chain (although Cedar Point Amusement Park originally opened in 1870) and a combination of the park names – &quot;cedar&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; – were used to name the original company.

==History==

Valleyfair opened on May 25, 1976, featuring 20 rides and attractions on , with the roller coaster High Roller being the main attraction. The carousel in the park came from Excelsior Amusement Park which was closed in 1973. It is the oldest ride in the park. In 1978 in an effort to increase investment capital for continued park expansion, Valleyfair was acquired by Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. Five years later, Cedar Fair Limited Partnership was formed as the parent company for Cedar Point and Valleyfair (the name being derived from the names of both properties). Since 1976, Valleyfair has invested over $96 million into the park, and today the park has over 75 attractions on of land.

A height restriction was imposed in 2000 with the building of the Power Tower. After negotiations with the FAA and the nearby Flying Cloud Airport, the FAA restricted the building height of the Power Tower at due to its proximity to the airport. Power Tower&#x27;s original plan was to be a height of and to take riders to .

Valleyfair did not open for the 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, although it was reopened for the 2021 season.

On July 1, 2024, a merger of equals between Cedar Fair and Six Flags was completed, creating Six Flags Entertainment Corporation. This officially retired the Cedar Fair branding that was partially derived from Valleyfair.

As the park is located on the banks of the Minnesota River, flooding can become an issue during the springtime months before the park usually opens (or when the park is open for the season), notably in 1988, 1993, 1997, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2024. Excalibur and Thunder Canyon are built outside of a pre-existing river dike, and were built with this flooding potential in mind.

These rides include the Antique Autos, which was formerly deconstructed to make room for the construction of Dinosaurs Alive!, the Tilt-a-Whirl, and the Scrambler. A new ride titled &#x27;Northern Lights&#x27; will be the main attraction of the area, featuring a ride track over 300 feet in length and 42 feet in height. This family-oriented ride reaches speeds upwards of 43 miles per hour and resembles the Aurora Borealis at night with colored lights in shades of greens, blues, and purples. The Route 76 area features a full-service catering and picnic area, titled Picnic Point. Route 76 is located in the front of the park near Steel Venom, and opened on May 16, 2014. In 2017, North Star, a 230-foot swing ride, was opened near the front of Route 76 near Tilt-a-Whirl.

==Shows==

Valleyfair hosts several performance venues with a wide variety of live entertainment at no additional charge.

*The Galaxy Theater is an indoor theater. Originally, it was used to stage musical revues, but in recent years, The Galaxy has played host to various comedy and magic acts, such as Rudy Coby, Ed Alonzo, Chipper Lowell, and All-Star Stunt Dogs. Galaxy Theater has remained closed to the public since 2020, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Marching bands march on a predetermined loop throughout the park and the Midway and Superior Stages are utilized for other performances. Most performances are 30 minutes or less, which allows students time to enjoy the park.

* KidWorks (2004–2010) – A re-themed children&#x27;s area located on the same site as Berenstain Bear Country. It added the Foam Ball Factory and Rockin&#x27; Tug to the area, both of which still remain in the park today. It also featured the addition of a small hedge maze and a Koi pond. The park&#x27;s former mascot, Colonel Ohoompapa, would make regular appearances in the area. KidWorks was revamped as a part of the Planet Snoopy expansion in 2011, which saw the removal of the hedge maze, Kidworks Railway, and other remnants of Berenstain Bear Country that still remained.
* Half Pint Park (1988–2010)  – A children&#x27;s area located near the entrance of High Roller. The area featured several attractions that have been removed, including the Lil&#x27; Guppy, Rub-a-Dub Tubs, Busy Boats, a climbing area, and the Kiddie Train. The area was also home to an upcharge bungee trampoline attraction called Xtreme Trampoline in 2005. Half Pint Park was revamped as a part of the Planet Snoopy expansion in 2011.
* Corkscrew TotSpot (–2010) – A set of three rides for small children located between The Wave and the entrance to Corkscrew, including Kiddie U-Turn, Kiddie Carousel, and Moon Buggies. The Corkscrew TotSpot was removed in 2010 as a part of the Planet Snoopy expansion in 2011.
* Northern Lights (1986–2005) – A Chance Rides Falling Star ride with a space theme, removed in 2005 to make room for Xtreme Swing.

* SkyScraper (2005–2007) – A Gravity Works SkyScraper ride located near the front of the park within Wild Thing&#x27;s figure-eight turnaround. It originally operated at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom from 2000 to 2004, and was eventually relocated to Cedar Point where it operated from 2008 to 2015. SkyScraper was an upcharge attraction.
* Tot Town (1981–1999) – A themed area featuring rides, a jungle gym and ball pit designed for small children. It was accessed via a suspension bridge that crossed over the park&#x27;s central lagoon. Tot Town was removed in 1999 to make room for Power Tower, which reuses the suspension bridge for its ride entrance.
* The Flume (1979–2008) – Known as &quot;Ye Olde Log Flume&quot; until the early 1990s, the Flume was a log flume ride. The Flume was permanently closed and dismantled at the end of the 2008 season. Soak City waterpark (previously Whitewater Country waterpark) was extended in place of the Flume to accommodate the installation of Breakers Bay, a wave pool attraction.
* Bumper Boats (1993–2010) – An upcharge Bumper boats ride, a part of the Challenge Park located near the front of Valleyfair. The Bumper Boats closed in 2009 and were removed in 2010. This ride was relocated to Michigan&#x27;s Adventure.
* Mild Thing (1976–2010) – A children&#x27;s roller coaster, originally called Mine Train and Kiddie Coaster prior to the park&#x27;s addition of Wild Thing, located in Half Pint Park. Mild Thing closed in 2010 as part of Valleyfair&#x27;s revamping of the children&#x27;s area into Planet Snoopy, and was replaced by Cosmic Coaster.
* Chaos (1997–2010) – A Chance Rides Chaos ride, which starts spinning in a horizontal position and gradually lifts into a vertical position. Each individual ride unit flips 360 degrees on its own axis. Chaos was removed prior to the 2011 season.
* Skipper and Dolly Dolphin Show (1977? – late 1980s) – A dolphin show featuring two Bottlenose dolphins named Skipper and Dolly. Given that the dolphins could not be properly housed there during the frigid Minnesota winter months and that various other amusement parks had their own &quot;Skipper and Dolly&quot; dolphin shows (such as Pontchartrain Beach and Six Flags AstroWorld), it can be assumed the two animals were transferred from location to location, depending on whichever parks wanted to incorporate the dolphins into their summertime show schedules.
* Adventure Golf (1992–2012) – Two upcharge 18-hole mini-golf courses, a part of the Challenge Park located near the front of Valleyfair.

==Halloween Haunt at ValleySCARE==

The Halloween Haunt is a Halloween event at Valleyfair that was originally known as HalloWeekends, which operated from 1998 to 2000 on weekends in September. The name was changed to Halloween Haunt when the event was brought back six years later in 2006. The Great Pumpkin Fest is a family-friendly Halloween event open during the day, while the park is under normal operation. At night, the Halloween Haunt would take over and featured haunted houses, outdoor mazes, scare zones, and live entertainment. Many rides remained in operation during the event, though some were closed to accommodate the transition. Valleyfair announced that the Halloween Haunt would not return for the 2022 operating season on February 25, 2022.

On April 2, 2024, Valleyfair announced the return of ValleySCARE for the 2024 operating season, with it now being a separate ticketed event in the evenings. The event will run on select weekends in September and October.

===Tricks and Treats===
Planet Spooky was added to the ValleySCARE lineup in 2011 with the park&#x27;s addition of Planet Snoopy. However, daytime family-friendly activities were present prior to the Planet Spooky name. In 2015 it was renamed to The Great Pumpkin Fest. In 2022, the family-friendly Halloween event was renamed again to &quot;Tricks and Treats&quot;. Tricks and Treats features a family oriented halloween event with multiple shows and performances from characters, trick or treating, four themed areas, and multiple events aimed at a younger audience. It was announced on March 14, 2024, that Tricks and Treats would be returning for the 2024 season.

<text>Hernani, officially the Municipality of Hernani (; ), is a municipality in the province of Eastern Samar, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 8,531 people.

It was formerly called Nag-as, after the name of the river flowing southeast of the town center.

== History ==
Hernani was founded around the year 1850 by a settler from Guiuan named Miguel Candido. Hernani, was created into a municipality by virtue of a Royal Order on January 4, 1864.

On October 12, 1897, giant tidal waves struck Hernani. More than 300 people were killed, and public buildings and houses were destroyed, including the newly–built stone church. Following the disaster, the survivors relocated the town center to a more secure place about one–half kilometer inland. This site is now the present location.

Immediately following the Philippine-American War, the political status of Hernani was reduced into a barrio under the jurisdiction of Lanang (now Llorente). In 1912, its status as a municipality was restored but the seat of local government was transferred to Pambujan (now General MacArthur). However, in 1926, the municipality of Hernani regained back the township by virtue of an Executive Order issued by then American Government–General Leonard Wood.

Hernani is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

==Specialized==
Words derived from Finnish used in more specialized fields:

*pulk - a type of toboggan (derivative of word )
*puukko - traditional Finnish sheath knife
*Rapakivi granite - a granite rock in petrology
*taimen - a species of salmon living in Siberia

==Cultural==
In English, Finnish words used with reference to the Finnish culture, but not nativized in English and not used in other contexts:

<doc id="989779" wikidata="Q5257490" url="?curid=989779" title="Denis Rocan">
<text>Denis Rocan (born February 14, 1949) is a former politician from Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 2007, and served as speaker of the assembly from 1988 to 1995. Rocan was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, but became an independent in 2007.

== Life ==
Rocan was born to a French-Canadian family in Somerset, Manitoba and was raised in north-end Winnipeg. He is also Métis by background and a direct descendant of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, the maternal grandparents of Louis Riel. He was educated at Sacré-Coeur in Winnipeg, Somerset Collegiate and Otterburne College. He is fluently bilingual in English and French. Rocan worked as a farmer before entering political life, and also operated a building and moving company and a grain business. He is a Shriner and a freemason, as well as a member of the Royal Canadian Legion.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, winning the rural, southern constituency of Turtle Mountain. Rural seats in southern Manitoba are generally considered safe for the Progressive Conservative party, and Rocan was elected by more than 2,000 votes over his nearest opponent. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Rocan served as a member of the opposition.

Rocan was re-elected over Liberal candidate Ross McMillan in the 1988 election, though his majority was cut to about 600 votes. The Progressive Conservatives emerged from this election with a minority government, and Rocan was appointed as speaker of the assembly by premier Gary Filmon on July 21, 1988. He was the first Franco-Manitoban to serve as speaker for the provincial assembly.

Support for the Liberal Party declined in the 1990 provincial election, and Rocan was easily re-elected in the redistributed constituency of Gladstone. He won the constituency a second time in the 1995 election, but was not re-appointed as speaker and served for the next four years as a backbench supporter of Filmon&#x27;s government. Rocan was respected by all parties in the legislature, and his tenure as speaker was free of the controversies over partisanship which plagued his successor, Louise Dacquay.

Further redistribution brought Rocan into the riding of Carman for the 1999 provincial election. He was easily returned, and was re-elected again in the 2003 election. The Progressive Conservatives lost both elections to the New Democratic Party, and Rocan served as a member of the opposition. A former smoker, he supported premier Gary Doer&#x27;s efforts to ban public smoking in 2003.

Rocan supported his friend Reg Alcock in the federal elections of 2000 and 2004, even though Alcock was a Liberal. Alcock won his re-election bids in Winnipeg South in those years.

On November 16, 2006, Rocan lost the Carman Conservative nomination to Blaine Pedersen. On April 18, 2007, Rocan was removed from the Conservative caucus for supporting the NDP budget, which his party opposed. He considered running as an independent candidate in the 2007 election, but declined.

Rocan later bought a small house in Arizona for the winter, becoming a long-haul trucker.

<doc id="989781" wikidata="Q5528807" url="?curid=989781" title="Gayle McLaughlin">
<text>Gayle McLaughlin (born 1952) is an American politician from Richmond, California. She was first elected to the Richmond City Council in 2004 when she was a member of the Green Party of California. She won two consecutive four-year terms as the city&#x27;s mayor in 2006 and 2010. After reaching the mayoral term limit, she was reelected to the City Council in 2014. In June 2017, she announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor of California in the 2018 election.

McLaughlin&#x27;s election in 2006 made Richmond the largest U.S. city led by a Green Party member. She has advocated for a minimum wage increase and a plan to forcibly appropriate foreclosed home mortgages from banks. She has led an ongoing effort to restrict the municipal influence of Richmond&#x27;s largest employer, the Chevron Corporation, and to refashion its environmental obligations.

==Early life and education==
McLaughlin was born into a working class family in Chicago. The middle child of five daughters, her father was a union carpenter and her mother was a factory worker and housewife.

During the 1980s, McLaughlin was an activist with the Central American solidarity movement and a steering committee member of CISPES (Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador). She also played an active role in the North Star Network, a national networking effort to unite progressives, and in coalition-building efforts with Rainbow/PUSH. She continues to work as a social activist in the peace, social justice, civil rights, and environmental movements.

McLaughlin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Bridgewater State University and took graduate courses in psychology and education at Rhode Island College and UC Berkeley Extension. 

== Career ==
She has worked as a postal clerk, teacher, caregiver for the elderly, and tutor/clinician for children with learning disabilities. She has also worked in the capacity of support staff for various not-for-profit health and educational organizations. She has lived in Richmond since 2001.

===Richmond Progressive Alliance===
McLaughlin is a founder of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA), a non-partisan progressive group in western Contra Costa County, composed of members of the Green Party, Democratic Party, and the Peace and Freedom Party, as well as independent voters. In 2004, the RPA ran a slate of candidates to replace a municipal government that was widely seen as dysfunctional: &quot;There are vacancies in virtually every major administrative department,&quot; wrote the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;and the city is operating with an interim city manager, city attorney, police chief and fire chief. The city has no library director and no parks and recreation director, and no one running its housing authority.&quot; Together with RPA colleagues, McLaughlin won her first election to the Richmond City Council in November 2004.

In Richmond, McLaughlin&#x27;s activism has found her involved in many local struggles in support of both social and environmental justice. She opposed the Patriot Act, the criminalization of the homeless, and Chevron&#x27;s Richmond Refinery tax perks. She has also been involved in an ongoing effort to stop development on the North Richmond shoreline and supports the Service Employees International Union.

===Mayor of Richmond===
In 2006, McLaughlin decided to challenge Richmond&#x27;s incumbent mayor Irma Anderson. She was elected on November 7, 2006 by a 242-vote margin over Anderson. At the time, her victory made Richmond the largest city in the country with a Green Party mayor. McLaughlin won a second term in office in the 2010 municipal election. She overcame a well-funded offensive to unseat her during the re-election campaign.

Under McLaughlin&#x27;s mayoralty, the &quot;small, blue-collar city best known for its Chevron refinery has become the unlikely vanguard for anticorporate, left-wing activism&quot;. From early in her career, McLaughlin gave tangible governmental support to workers&#x27; cooperatives as a means of fighting unemployment. She was a strong proponent of Measure N, a proposed municipal soda tax that was met by determined, well-funded resistance from the American Beverage Association and other business interests. She also spearheaded a 2014 effort to raise Richmond&#x27;s local minimum wage to US$12.30 per hour. The raise provided impetus to the broader statewide minimum wage movement. McLaughlin was a member of the nationwide advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition.

McLaughlin was criticized for attending an Occupy rally on Veterans Day of 2011 instead of a symbolic ship-launching portrayal at the former Richmond Shipyards. McLaughlin stated she was a supporter of Veterans for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War.

====Eminent domain against banks====
The U.S. mortgage crisis of the late 2000s had a powerful impact on Richmond. Even by 2013, nearly half of all home mortgages in the city were &quot;underwater&quot;, with owners owing more than their houses were worth. On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes. McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at fair market value and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal power of eminent domain.

Defending the plan, McLaughlin said mortgage seizures were necessary to alleviate &quot;an unjust set of circumstances&quot; facing homeowners after the Great Recession, and the use of eminent domain would be justified for the common good by preventing urban blight caused by abandoned foreclosed homes. The city thus has a right and duty to prevent foreclosures, as well as a legal necessity to protect its citizens: &quot;People were tricked. They were sold these bad loans&quot; which were far in excess of their value, and made Richmond &quot;a community being victimized&quot;. In March 2013, the City Council voted 6–1 in favor of partnering with a San Francisco firm, Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP), to begin enactment of the plan.

Opponents in Richmond countered that the plan would help only a small subsection of mortgage-holders, while two banks, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, immediately filed lawsuits against the city. Arguing that it was an illegal use of eminent domain, the banks also warned that it would severely damage the U.S. mortgage industry by encouraging other municipalities to do the same. Other cities, including Newark, North Las Vegas, and Seattle were all said to be considering mortgage seizure, although only Richmond publicly pursued the plan. Undaunted, McLaughlin told the press in August 2013 that her administration was confident that it would prevail in court against the banks. The following month, after heated public debate, the City Council again voted to back McLaughlin and proceed with the plan.

====Chevron====
McLaughlin had a contentious relationship with the Chevron Corporation during her political career. The multinational energy corporation maintains a massive, century-old oil refinery in Richmond, and it has long dominated the city&#x27;s economy and politics. After the RPA took root, however, the shift in government caused friction with Chevron, particularly after the McLaughlin administration fought it in court over the payment of various taxes. A major fire at the refinery in August 2012 led to another hotly contested lawsuit, this time for &quot;willful and conscious disregard of public safety&quot;.

Chevron spent $1.2 million in 2012 to oppose two Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) City Council candidates who were critical of the company and to support three that the oil company considered supportive. That was the one year that the RPA candidates lost. McLaughlin herself was not up for reelection that year, but strongly supported the two RPA candidates with whom she shared progressive values.

===Return to City Council===
Even after her mayoralty ended, Chevron continued to oppose her vigorously, &quot;spending some $3 million – an unheard of amount for a small, local election – to campaign against McLaughlin and her slate&quot; in the 2014 city council elections. She was nonetheless elected to the City Council in 2014 and served in this role until July 18, 2017, when she resigned to seek a higher political office.

McLaughlin is not without critics such as the &quot;East Bay Times&quot;, which referred to her and the RPA in a 2016 editorial as &quot;the biggest deniers of the city&#x27;s fiscal crisis.&quot;

She and her fellow RPA candidates Eduardo Martinez and Jovanka Beckles all won by wide margins in 2014 despite having been heavily outspent by their opposition. The 2016 City Council elections were noticeably quieter in tone, with no financial input from Chevron, according to campaign finance reports. Two other RPA candidates, Melvin Willis and Ben Choi, won open seats creating a RPA majority in the City Council.

In 2016, McLaughlin changed her political party registration from Green Party to NPP (&quot;No Party Preference&quot;) so she could vote for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the California presidential primary.

=== Campaign for lieutenant governor ===
In June 2017, McLaughlin declared her candidacy for lieutenant governor in the California lieutenant gubernatorial election of 2018. Her independent campaign refused to accept any corporate contributions.

Although McLaughlin ran with no party affiliation, her endorsements include the California National Party, the Peninsula chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, the Green Party of California, Our Revolution, the Peace and Freedom Party, the People&#x27;s Party, and the Richmond Progressive Alliance.

The hotly contested primary race saw over $10 million raised by campaigns, &quot;far more than the $7.6 million that candidates raised for the entire election cycle the last time the seat was open in 2010&quot;. In a crowded field of eight, McLaughlin won 263,364 votes (4.0%).

=== Books ===
A chronicle of the McLaughlin administration&#x27;s rise and legacy, &quot;Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Remaking of an American City&quot;, was published in 2017 with a foreword written by Bernie Sanders. This was followed in early 2018 by McLaughlin&#x27;s own memoir, &quot;Winning Richmond: How a Progressive Alliance Won City Hall&quot;.
