<text>Gurinder Kaur Chadha, (born 10 January 1960) is a Kenyan-born British film director of Indian origin. Most of her films explore the lives of Indians living in England. The common theme in her work showcases the trials of Indian women residing in the UK and how they must reconcile their converging traditional and modern cultures. Many of her films address social and emotional issues, especially ones faced by immigrants caught between two worlds.

Much of her work also consists of adaptations from book to film, but with a different flair. She is best known for the films &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot; (1993), &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; (2002), &quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot; (2004), &quot;Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging&quot; (2008), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Afterlife&quot; (2010) and &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s House&quot; (2017). Her latest features are the biographical musical comedy-drama &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; (2019) and the television show &quot;Beecham House&quot;.

== Early life ==
Gurinder Chadha was born in Nairobi, Kenya, then a British colony. Her Punjabi Sikh Khatri family was part of the Indian diaspora in East Africa. Bhajan, her father (who died in 1999), and her mother were both born in Kenya, and remained there until the political turbulence leading up to independence prompted the family to relocate. Her family held &quot;united citizenship&quot; under the British Nationality Act 1948 which granted them rights of entry and settlement in Britain. Her father moved first and was joined by the family the following year moving to Southall, West London, when she was two years of age, where she attended Clifton Primary School. Chadha&#x27;s father faced prejudice because of his appearance as a Sikh Indian, wearing a turban and having a beard. Her father had worked as a clerical officer in Barclays Bank in Kenya but was unable to secure the same position due to his appearance. Eventually, the family opened a shop to support the family.

Many of her future films would draw on her personal experience of being Indian and English at the same time, and how she dealt with the duality of her identity. Upon completion of her documentary, &quot;I&#x27;m British but...&quot; Chadha insisted the premiere be held at the Southall Community Center to honour her home community. She would not wear traditional Indian clothing, and refused to cook for her family. In her mind, having all the women in the kitchen cooking while the men sat and ate was oppressive, although it is a living part of Indian culture. Therefore, she sat at the table with the men and was &quot;extremely outspoken.&quot; After graduating from the University of East Anglia where she studied politics and developmental economics before radio journalism, Chadha attended the London College of Printing in 1984/85 and studied as a post-graduate. When she decided she wanted to go to the University of East Anglia to do development studies, her teachers suggested a secretarial course, or a lesser university.

== Career ==
After beginning her media career in radio in the mid-1980s, Chadha became a BBC television news reporter. She directed award-winning documentaries for the British Film Institute, BBC and Channel Four, and in 1989 released the documentary &quot;I&#x27;m British but...&quot; for Channel 4, which followed the lives of young British Asians. In 1990, Chadha established a production company, Umbi Films having no formal film training. Her first film was the 11-minute &quot;Nice Arrangement&quot; (1991) about a British Asian wedding. It was selected for the Cannes Film Festival Critic&#x27;s section in 1991.

Chadha mentions the influence that the film &quot;Purab aur Pachhim&quot; had on her work, in an interview with Robert K. Elder for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;.
There&#x27;s a wonderful kind of yearning quality about what is culture and the perils of living in the West and the dangers of what could happen.

Her affinity for stories about families was also attributed to her love for &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

She was empowered by British Bhangra music which combines Punjabi folk rhythms, electronic instrumentation, Bombay film styles, and Western disco; &quot;I&#x27;m British, but...&quot; uses this type of music as a metaphor for syncretic nature of British Asian identity.

Her documentary &quot;Acting our Age (1992)&quot;, set out to understand what it was like being Asian and elderly in Britain. During production she gave film crew to the elderly participants and allowed them to create their own film in order to challenge perception and layer spectator images.

Her first feature, &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot; (1994), won numerous international awards including a BAFTA Nomination for &#x27;Best British Film of 1994&#x27; and the Evening Standard British Film Award for &#x27;Best Newcomer to British Cinema&#x27;. Chadha first received wide recognition for the film in 1993. It was the first full-length feature film made by a British Asian woman. The film concerns a day in the lives of Indian women, across different generations, and how they change in order to converge their cultural background with modern UK living. Chadha utilizes subtlety and nuances in dialogue and fashion in order to relay the fact that these women come from a very specific culture. For example, one character wears a leather jacket over her Indian garb, showing how she is fusing her two cultures. Prejudice comes from both outside and inside the British-Indian community; white men treat the immigrants as garbage, while the older generation of Indian women judge the modern woman is challenged by the progressive views of the younger women, as they try to break free from the &quot;oppression&quot; that Chadha fought hard to break free from herself. Her 1994 interview with Ali Kazimi in Rungh Magazine focusses on many of the main themes in Bhaji on the Beach.

Issues of domestic abuse and male superiority are also showcased in the film, as one character and her young son are chased by her abusive husband and his family. Another character, who is expected to be a doctor by her parents and the local Indian community, becomes pregnant by a black classmate, which is a taboo in the community. The film was low budget, but received critical success for its take on racial stereotypes, immigration, and gender roles. Several major projects followed including &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; (2002) and &quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot; (2004).

In 1995, she directed &quot;Rich Deceiver&quot;, a two-part drama for the BBC, watched by 11 million viewers.

Her award-winning films have earned over $300 million at the international box office.

&quot;What&#x27;s Cooking?&quot; was the Opening Night Film of the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, and was the first British script to be invited to the Sundance Institute&#x27;s Writer&#x27;s Lab. The film was voted joint audience award winner in the New York Film Critics&#x27; 2000 season (tied with &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;), and Chadha won the award for Best British Director in the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Awards.

&quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; was the highest grossing British-financed, British-distributed film, ever in the UK box-office (prior to the success of &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;). The film was a critical and commercial success internationally, topping the box-office charts in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and South Africa, and winning audience favourite film awards at the Locarno, Sydney and Toronto film festivals. The film received a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy), a BAFTA Nomination for Best British Film, a European Film Academy Nomination for Best Film, and a Writers Guild of America Nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Like &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot;, &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; features a strong Indian-British woman, Jess, who tries to realize her dreams while maneuvering through her duties as a daughter of traditional Indian parents. Although marketed to the United States as a &quot;chick flick&quot;, it is regarded in Britain as an important post-feminist film that fits perfectly into the British progressive frame of 2002. Prime Minister Blair even wrote a congratulatory letter to Chadha, saying, &quot;We loved it, loved it, because this is my Britain.&quot; Chadha herself meant for the film to be a &quot;girl power&quot; movie, which features both a white woman and an Indian-British woman fighting for their shared dream of playing professional soccer. It addressed issues of prejudice against race and sexuality, however, allowing the film to transcend the &quot;chick flick&quot; moniker. Topics of interracial coupling and lesbian stereotyping add meaning to the &quot;girl power movie.&quot; In 2015, Chada mounted the stage musical version of &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; in London&#x27;s West End to 5-Star Reviews &amp; critics&#x27; awards.

&quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot;, a film which marries Jane Austen with Indian and Western musicals, was the first film ever to open at Number One in the UK and India on the same day. It attempted to fuse Bollywood, Hollywood, and a &quot;British sensibility&quot; into one film. For each character and scene of the original novel, Chadha adds an Indian twist. For example, the original diversity of class between the two leads in the original book are changed into a diversity of race, having the female lead as an Indian and the male lead a white man. The film was not meant to be an actual Bollywood movie, however. Much of the film is Westernized for a Western audience. There are both Bollywood numbers and Western musical numbers inspired by the likes of &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

She wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Mistress of Spices&quot; (2005), based upon the novel of the same name by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, with Berges, who directed the film.

In 2005, Chadha appeared on the BBC show &quot;Your London&quot;, in which she told the story of a Sikh prince who lived in London in the 19th century. In 2006, she took part in the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in which she traced her Sikh family roots back to Kenya and before that to India&#x27;s Punjab.

&quot;Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging&quot; – based on the international bestseller, was released worldwide by Paramount Pictures in 2008/2009. &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Afterlife&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival before releasing internationally in 2010.

Chadha has received several Honorary Doctorates from British universities and was awarded an O.B.E. in the 2006 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List on 17 June 2006 for her services to the British film industry.

Although the BBC had confirmed that Chadha was to direct the forthcoming feature film adaptation of the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, she left the project in 2007.

In 2011, Chadha was announced to be collaborating with composer A. R. Rahman and lyricist Stephen Schwartz on DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s first musical set in India. She has announced an animated musical entitled &quot;Monkeys of Bollywood&quot;, based on the Indian epic Ramayana. Reportedly, the Bollywood-style animated musical is set in Mumbai and revolves around two monkeys who try to stop an ancient demon from conquering the world. It is produced by DreamWorks Animation.

Her film &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s House&quot;, an epic drama on Indian Independence and Partition based on the books &quot;Freedom at Midnight&quot; by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre and &quot;The Shadow of the Great Game: The Untold Story of India&#x27;s Partition&quot; by Narendra Singh Sunila, was released in 2017.

She was a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2015.

Chadha created, co-wrote and directed the Indian historical series &quot;Beecham Hous&quot;e which aired on ITV in 2019.

Chadha was announced to direct an animated musical film adaptation of the graphic novel &quot;Pashmina&quot; for Netflix later in 2019. However, the film was cancelled in 2022.

As of 2021, Chadha is working as a writer, director and producer on a stop-motion musical film set in India. The film will reportedly tell the story of Bodhi, a young Indian elephant from the jungles of Kerala with an impossible dream – to be a Bollywood dancer. It is produced by Aardman Animations.

She spoke in the British Parliament in January 2024, discussing the British film industry and told MPs that her upcoming film was would have an Indian lead character, saying &quot;My Scrooge is an Indian Tory who hates refugees&quot;. Her project &quot;Christmas Karma&quot; was subsequently announced, described as a Bollywood musical inspired by Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It will feature music from Gary Barlow, Shaznay Lewis, and Nitin Sawhney.

== Personal life ==
Chadha is married to American screenwriter and director Paul Mayeda Berges, and they have twins together, a boy named Ronak and a girl named Kumiko, born in 2007. Chadha has spoken out about the representation of women in the film industry. At a 2017 Bird&#x27;s Eye View event at Sands Films in London, Chadha stressed the importance of actively supporting female filmmakers at the cinema, especially on the opening weekend. She also noted that women can no longer be passive in the fight for change within a historically male-dominated industry.

The British Film Institute&#x27;s recent filmography study on British Cinema history named Chadha as the U.K&#x27;s most prolific female director working today and was honoured with the Sophiya Haque Services to British Television and Film Award at the 2017 Asian Media Awards.

She is an active patron of numerous charities including MAF (Medical Aid Films) is a Creative Mentor and Role Model for Creative Access, Directors UK Inspire, the BFI and the Sundance Directors&#x27; Lab, and Patron of Women in Film U.K.

With regard to her religious beliefs, Chadha told the BBC in an October 2014 interview:

On April 20, 2020, Chadha revealed on social media that she lost her paternal aunt Bhuaji to COVID-19.

<text>Apple Inc. uses a large variety of typefaces in its marketing, operating systems, and industrial design with each product cycle. These change throughout the years with Apple&#x27;s change of style in their products. This is evident in the design and marketing of the company. The current logo is a white apple with a bite out of it, which was first utilized in 2013.

==Marketing==
For at least 18 years, Apple&#x27;s corporate typeface was a custom variant of the ITC Garamond typeface called Apple Garamond. It was used alongside the Apple logo for product names on computers, in many ads and printed materials, and on the company&#x27;s website. Starting in 2001, Apple gradually shifted towards using Myriad in its marketing. Starting with iPhone 7 in 2016, Apple switched the typeface of the word mark &quot;iPhone&quot; to San Francisco on products and its website.

===Hand-drawn logo===
Prior to adopting the bitten Apple as its logo, Apple used a complex logo featuring Isaac Newton sitting below an apple tree. The words &quot;APPLE COMPUTER CO.&quot; were drawn on a ribbon banner ornamenting the picture frame. The frame itself held a quotation from Wordsworth: &quot;Newton...A Mind Forever Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought...Alone.&quot;, taken from Wordsworth&#x27;s autobiographical poem &quot;The Prelude&quot;. The logo was hand drawn and thus did not use an established font. However, the type is similar to Caslon.

===Motter Tektura===

Before the introduction of the first Macintosh, Apple used a typeface called Motter Tektura for their company logo and product labels, which was originally designed in Austria by Othmar Motter of Vorarlberger Graphik in 1975 and distributed by Letraset (and also famously used by Reebok). At the time, the typeface was considered new and modern. The exact font used by Apple is slightly modified from the standard Motter Tektura: the &quot;s&quot; is more conventionally shaped, as opposed to the descending &quot;hook&quot; design of the normal typeface, and (with the exception of the Disk II 5.25 drive) the dot over the &quot;i&quot; is removed.

According to the logo designer, Rob Janoff, the typeface was selected for its playful qualities and techno look, which were in line with Apple&#x27;s mission statement of making high technology accessible to anyone. Janoff designed the logo in 1977 while working with Palo Alto marketer Regis McKenna. The Apple logo&#x27;s bite mark was originally designed to fit snugly with the Motter Tektura &quot;a&quot;.

In the early 1980s, the company logo was simplified by removing &quot;computer .&quot;. Motter Tektura is most notably used for the Apple II logo. The typeface has sometimes been mislabeled as Cupertino, a similar bitmap font likely created to mimic Motter Tektura.

===Apple Garamond===

Since the introduction of the first Macintosh in 1984, Apple adopted a new corporate font called Apple Garamond. It was a variation of the classic Garamond typeface, both narrower and having a taller x-height. Specifically, ITC Garamond (created by Tony Stan in 1977) was condensed to 80% of its normal width. Bitstream condensed the font, subtly adjusted the stroke widths, and performed the hinting required to create the font, which was delivered to Apple as the Postscript font &quot;apgaram&quot;.

In cases where the Apple logo was accompanied by text, it was always set in Apple Garamond. Aside from the company name, most of Apple&#x27;s advertising and marketing slogans, such as &quot;Think different&quot;, used the font as well.

The typeface was virtually synonymous with Apple for almost two decades and formed a large part of the company&#x27;s brand recognition. It was used not only in conjunction with the logo, but also in manuals and ads and to label products with model names.

Apple has not released the true Apple Garamond font. ITC briefly sold ITC Garamond Narrow—Apple Garamond without the custom hinting—as part of its Apple Font Pack in the 1990s. A version of the font was also included under a different name in some versions of Mac OS X prior to 10.3 as it was used by the Setup Assistant installation program.

===Gill Sans===
In the marketing of the Newton/Notepad/MessagePad PDA (starting in 1992), Apple used Gill Sans instead of the regular Apple Garamond. Gill Sans Regular was used in the logo, for the model name on the computer, on the keyboard and in advertising materials, though it was not used as a screen font (except as part of the Newton logo itself).

===Myriad===
In 2002, Apple gradually started using a variant of the Adobe Myriad font family in its marketing and packaging. As new revisions of its products were released, the text changed from the serif Apple Garamond to the sans-serif Myriad Apple. The family&#x27;s bolds were used for headlines, and other weights accordingly.

The Myriad font family was designed by Robert Slimbach and Carol Twombly for Adobe. Adobe&#x27;s most recent version of Myriad is Myriad Pro, which has some additional enhancements and character set extensions, but is not significantly changed in design. Myriad Apple, a modification produced by Galápagos Design Group, incorporates minor spacing and weight differences from the standard varieties, and includes Apple-specific characters, such as the company logo. In 2006, Myriad Apple was superseded by Myriad Set, which contains extra ligatures and other minor changes.

As of November 2013, lighter fonts are prevalent in Apple&#x27;s marketing, with headlines in Myriad Pro Light. Occasionally an even lighter variant of Myriad is used for specialized marketing materials and press releases.

===San Francisco===

In 2015, with the release of the Apple Watch, Apple began the usage of San Francisco in Apple Watch marketing materials, as well as in the Apple Music wordmark. In September 2016, the company began using it as the typeface of word marks such as &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;AirPods&quot;, and &quot;MacBook Pro&quot; on the devices themselves, as well as keynote slides and product packaging. This change was also reflected in some headlines on product marketing web pages. Subsequently, on January 24, 2017, Apple began updating its website to use the San Francisco font, and as a result it became the company’s universal typeface for all its products.

==System fonts==
Apple has used a variety of system fonts for the user interfaces of its products.

===Early fonts===
Apple&#x27;s earliest computers, along with other personal computers of the period, had extremely limited graphical capabilities and could originally display only uppercase ASCII using a set bitmap font. The IIc and Enhanced Apple IIe expanded on this, supporting 40 or 80 columns of text and an extended character set called MouseText. It was used to simulate simple graphical user interfaces, similar to the use of ANSI X3.64.

The first Apple computer with a purely bitmapped display, the Lisa, shipped in 1983. It used a system font with distinctive V and W letterforms.

===Chicago and Charcoal===

The Macintosh, introduced in 1984, used a bitmap font, Chicago, designed by Susan Kare. In Mac OS 8, introduced in 1997, the system font of Mac OS was changed to Charcoal. Charcoal was designed by David Berlow of Font Bureau, to be easier to read than Chicago, while retaining similar metrics for backward compatibility with existing application software.

When released in 2001, Apple&#x27;s iPod music player reused the Macintosh font Chicago as the system font. Later versions of the iPod drew from the larger character repertoire of the TrueType Chicago, adding a number of characters not present in the bitmap Chicago, such as Greek and Cyrillic. Even though the screen supported grayscale, the characters were not anti-aliased.

===Geneva===
For smaller user interface elements, such as the names of files displayed with icons in the Finder, Apple used the Geneva typeface, a redesigned version of Helvetica.

===Shaston===
Introduced in 1986, the Apple II, had very tall pixels (pixel aspect ratio of 5:12 or 5:6, with 640 × 200 or 320 × 200 pixels in a 4:3 image), thus requiring a stout, 8-point bitmap font called Shaston 8 as the system font (for menus, window titles, etc.). Shaston was described in Apple II technote #41 as &quot;a modified Helvetica&quot;, but the similarities are not striking. The fonts of the original Macintosh were also available for the .

===Espy Sans===
In 1991, Apple&#x27;s Human Interface Group contracted with LetterPerfect Fonts&#x27; Garrett Boge and Damon Clark, to design a family of bitmap screen fonts to replace Chicago and Geneva for the Mac OS version 7.5. The family consisted of Sans &amp; Serif, Regular and Bold in discrete bitmap sizes of 8, 9, 10, 12 &amp; 14 pt. The Sans, proving most useful for screen readability, was also used for the Newton OS GUI. The Newton used the font Apple Casual to display text entered using the Rosetta handwriting recognition engine in the Newton. The same font found its way into the Rosetta-derived writing recognition system in Mac OS X—Inkwell. The TrueType font can be made available to any application by copying the font file, which is embedded in a system component, to any font folder. (See List of macOS fonts for more information.) The Newton logo featured the Gill Sans typeface, which was also used for the Newton keyboard.

Espy Sans was later used as the font for Apple&#x27;s eWorld online service in 1994. (eWorld also used the larger bold condensed bitmap font eWorld Tight for headlines. The metrics of eWorld Tight were based on Helvetica Ultra Compressed.) The iPod mini, released in 2004, also used Espy Sans.

===Lucida Grande===
Since its introduction in 2000 up through OS X Mavericks, Lucida Grande was the system font used in Mac OS X user interface elements, such as menus, dialog boxes, and other widgets. It was superseded by Helvetica Neue.

===Podium Sans===
Starting in 2004, the iPod photo, 5th-generation iPod, and 1st- through 2nd-generation iPod nano feature a bitmap font known as Podium Sans, displacing the use of Chicago as the iPod system font. Although originally promoted as Myriad, Podium Sans is missing Myriad&#x27;s trademark features, such as the splayed &quot;M&quot; and distinctive &quot;y&quot;.

=== Helvetica===
Since the introduction of the 1st-generation iPhone in 2007, Apple has used Helvetica in its software design. iOS for the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and Apple TV employs the font, alongside its use on iPods beginning with the 6th-generation iPod classic and 3rd-generation iPod nano.

In conjunction with the iPhone 4 in 2010, Apple began using Helvetica Neue on devices with Retina display, while keeping use of Helvetica on non-Retina devices.

Around 2012, Apple started using Helvetica in macOS (then named OS X) application software. iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, GarageBand, and Apple&#x27;s professional applications started to feature heavy use of Helvetica, while the majority of the OS X (now named macOS) environment retained the comparatively more legible Lucida Grande typeface, which was designed specifically for on-screen use.

After the introduction of iOS 7 in June 2013, Apple began using an extra-thin weight of Helvetica Neue for the user interface of iOS 7, arousing numerous complaints about the less legible typography. For the final release of the operating system, Apple changed the system&#x27;s font to a slightly thicker weight of Helvetica Neue, although some have complained that readability is still compromised compared to the font weight used in former versions of iOS. Older iOS devices continue to use Helvetica or Helvetica Neue in regular font weights that display with higher contrast on low-resolution displays.

With the introduction of OS X 10.10 &quot;Yosemite&quot; in June 2014, Apple started using Helvetica Neue as the system font on the Mac. This brought all of Apple&#x27;s user interfaces in line, using Helvetica Neue throughout.

===San Francisco===

San Francisco is currently used for user interface across all of Apple&#x27;s product line, including watchOS, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and visionOS. The three main variants are SF Pro for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS; SF Compact for watchOS; and SF Mono for the Terminal, Console, and Xcode applications. It was first introduced alongside the Apple Watch, where it was used for enhanced legibility and taller x-heights for easy reading on a small display. The design references a number of different other typefaces, notably FF DIN (used in the UI of the Camera app in iOS 7 and iOS 8), Helvetica (used in the UI in iOS 6 and below), Helvetica Neue (used in the UI of iOS 7 and iOS 8 as well as OS X Yosemite, with some devices even with iOS 4 through iOS 6), Roboto (Google&#x27;s new UI typeface), and Univers (used on Apple&#x27;s early keyboard designs).

It was widely speculated that San Francisco was going to be the long-awaited font that Apple had reportedly been developing for independent use in their products, and the font&#x27;s name was leaked in November 2014 when the WatchKit SDK was released to developers. On June 8, 2015, at the WWDC 2015 conference, San Francisco replaced Helvetica Neue as the system font for both macOS and iOS operating systems. The version used, known as &quot;SF UI&quot;, was modified to make it wider than its Apple Watch counterpart, more akin to the previously used Helvetica Neue. The original version has since been renamed &quot;SF Compact&quot;.

===New York===
In 2019, Apple released New York, a serif counterpart to San Francisco.

==Keyboards==
Apple&#x27;s keyboards were long labeled with Univers 48 (Condensed Light Oblique), a design choice by Apple&#x27;s industrial design partner, Frog Design. This began in 1984 with the Apple IIc, which had tilted front-panel buttons to match the inclination of the lettering.

Univers was eventually replaced on Apple&#x27;s keyboards by VAG Rounded, which was used on all iBook models, PowerBooks introduced after 2003, and MacBooks, MacBooks Pro, MacBooks Air, and Apple Keyboards from August 2007 until early 2015. The font was developed by Sedley Place Ltd. for German car manufacturer Volkswagen and was used in much of their marketing materials.

On March 9, 2015, Apple introduced a new generation of MacBook that utilizes the Apple designed San Francisco typeface.

<doc id="1005264" wikidata="Q1514754" url="?curid=1005264" title="Septum pellucidum">
<text>The septum pellucidum (Latin for &quot;translucent wall&quot;) is a thin, triangular, vertical double membrane separating the anterior horns of the left and right lateral ventricles of the brain. It runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum down to the fornix.

The septum is not present in the syndrome septo-optic dysplasia.

==Structure==
The septum pellucidum is located in the septal area in the midline of the brain between the two cerebral hemispheres. The septal area is also the location of the septal nuclei. It is attached to the lower part of the corpus callosum, the large collection of nerve fibers that connect the two cerebral hemispheres. It is attached to the front forward part of the fornix. The lateral ventricles sit on either side of the septum.

The septum pellucidum consists of two layers or &quot;laminae&quot; of both white and gray matter. During fetal development, there is a space between the two laminae called the cave of septum pellucidum that, in ninety percent of cases, disappears during infancy. 
The &quot;cavum&quot; was occasionally referred to as &quot;the fifth ventricle&quot;, but this is no longer used because the space is usually not continuous with the ventricular system. The fifth ventricle is recognised as the terminal enlargement of the spinal cord.

==Clinical significance==
Absence of the septum pellucidum occurs in septo-optic dysplasia, a rare developmental disorder usually characterized by abnormal development of the optic disk and pituitary deficiencies. Symptoms of septo-optic dysplasia are highly variable and may include vision difficulties, low muscle tone, hormonal problems, seizures, intellectual problems, and jaundice at birth. Management is directed at the symptoms a person is affected with.

<doc id="1005294" wikidata="Q131094" url="?curid=1005294" title="Kentrosaurus">
<text>Kentrosaurus ( ; ) is a genus of stegosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic in Lindi Region of Tanzania. The type species is K. aethiopicus, named and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915. Often thought to be a &quot;primitive&quot; member of the Stegosauria, several recent cladistic analyses find it as more derived than many other stegosaurs, and a close relative of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; from the North American Morrison Formation within the Stegosauridae.

Fossils of &quot;K. aethiopicus&quot; have been found only in the Tendaguru Formation, dated to the late Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages, about 152 million years ago. Hundreds of bones were unearthed by German expeditions to German East Africa between 1909 and 1912. Although no complete skeletons are known, the remains provided a nearly complete picture of the build of the animal. In the Tendaguru Formation, it coexisted with a variety of dinosaurs such as the carnivorous theropods &quot;Elaphrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Veterupristisaurus,&quot; giant herbivorous sauropods &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; and &quot;Tornieria&quot;, and the dryosaurid &quot;Dysalotosaurus.&quot;

&quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; generally measured around in length as an adult, and weighed about . It walked on all fours with straight hindlimbs. It had a small, elongated head with a beak used to bite off plant material that would be digested in a large gut. It had a, probably double, row of small plates running down its neck and back. These plates gradually merged into spikes on the hip and tail. The longest spikes were on the tail end and were used to actively defend the animal. There also was a long spike on each shoulder. The thigh bones come in two different types, suggesting that one sex was larger and more stout than the other.

==Discovery and naming==

The first fossils of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; were discovered by the German Tendaguru Expedition in 1909, recognised as belonging to a stegosaur by expedition leader Werner Janensch on 24 July 1910, and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915. The name &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was coined by Hennig and comes from the Greek &#x27;/, meaning &quot;sharp point&quot; or &quot;prickle&quot;, and &#x27;/ meaning &quot;lizard&quot;, Hennig added the specific name &quot;aethiopicus&quot; to denote the provenance from Africa. Soon after its description, a controversy arose over the stegosaur&#x27;s name, which is very similar to the ceratopsian &quot;Centrosaurus&quot;. Under the rules of biological nomenclature, forbidding homonymy, two animals may not be given the same name. Hennig renamed his stegosaur &quot;Kentrurosaurus&quot;, &quot;pointed-tail lizard&quot;, in 1916, while Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa renamed the genus &quot;Doryphorosaurus&quot;, &quot;lance-bearing lizard&quot;, the same year. If a renaming had been necessary, Hennig&#x27;s would have had priority. However, because the spelling is different, both &quot;Doryphorosaurus&quot; and &quot;Kentrurosaurus&quot; are unneeded replacement names; &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; remains the valid name for the genus with &quot;Kentrurosaurus&quot; and &quot;Doryphorosaurus&quot; being its junior objective synonyms.
Although no complete individuals were found, some material was discovered in association, including a nearly complete tail, hip, several dorsal vertebrae and some limb elements of one individual. These form the core of a mount in the Museum für Naturkunde by Janensch. The mount was dismantled during the museum renovation in 2006/2007, and re-mounted in an improved pose by Research Casting International. Some other material, including a braincase and spine, was thought to have been misplaced or destroyed during World War II. However, all the supposedly lost cranial material was later found in a drawer of a basement cupboard.

From 1909 onwards, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; remains were uncovered in four quarries in the &quot;Mittlere Saurierschichten&quot; (Middle Saurian Beds) and one quarry in the &quot;Obere Saurierschichten&quot; (Upper Saurian Beds). During four field seasons, the German Expedition found over 1200 bones of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, belonging to about fifty individuals, many of which were destroyed during the Second World War. Today, almost all remaining material is housed in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (roughly 350 remaining specimens), while the museum of the Institute for Geosciences of the University of Tübingen houses a composite mount, roughly 50% of it being original bones. 

In the original description, Hennig did not designate a holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the osteology, systematic position and palaeobiology of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; in 1925, Hennig picked the most complete partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and is included in the mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, north of Tendaguru hill.

Unaware that Hennig had already defined a lectotype, Peter Galton selected two dorsal vertebrae, specimens MB.R.1930 and MB.R.1931, from the material figured in Hennig&#x27;s 1915 description, as &#x27;holotypes&#x27;. This definition of a holotype is not valid, because Hennig&#x27;s selection has priority. In 2011, Heinrich Mallison clarified that all the material known to Hennig in 1915, i.e. all the bones discovered before 1912, when Hermann Heck concluded the last German excavations, are paralectotypes, and that MB.R.4800 is the correct lectotype.

== Description ==

&quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was a small stegosaur. It had the typical dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, horizontal and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs and an array of plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal.

===Size and posture===

&quot;Kentrosaurus aethiopicus&quot; was a relatively small stegosaur, reaching in length and in body mass. Some specimens suggest that relatively larger individuals could have existed. These specimens are comparable to some &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; specimens in terms of the olecranon process in development.

The long tail of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; results in a position of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests just in front of the hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight. The center of mass was not heavily modified by the osteoderms (bony structures in skin) in &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; or &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, which allowed the animals to stay mobile despite their armament. The hindlimbs’ thigh muscles were very powerful, allowing &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; to reach a tripod stance on its hindlegs and tail.

=== Skull and dentition ===
Eight specimens from the skull, mandible, and teeth have been collected and described from the Tendaguru Formation, most of them being isolated elements. Two quadrates (bones from the jaw joint) were referred to &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, but they instead belong to a juvenile brachiosaurid.

The long and narrow skull was small in proportion to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull&#x27;s low position suggests that &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of premaxillary teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of cheeks in stegosaurs. Due to its phylogenetic position, it is unlikely that &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; had an extensive beak like &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and it instead probably had a beak restricted to the jaw tips. Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks, rather than beaks.

There are two nearly complete braincases known from &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; though they exhibit some taphonomic distortion. The frontals and parietals are flat and broad, with the latter bearing two transversely concave ventral sides with a ridge running down the middle that divides them. The lateral surface of the frontals form part of the orbit (eye socket) and the medial side creates the anterior part of the endocranial cavity (braincase). Basioccipitals (where the skull articulated with the cervical vertebrae) form the posterior floor of the brain and the occipital condyle, which is large and spherical in &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;. The rest of the braincase is formed by the presphenoid composing the anterior end. The overall braincase morphology is very similar to those of &quot;Tuojiangosaurus&quot;, &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. However, the occipital condyle is a closer distance to the basisphenoid tubera (bone at the front of the braincase) in &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot; than in &quot;Tuojiangosaurus&quot; and some specimens of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. Due to dinosaurs having more molding in their braincases, endocasts of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; can be reconstructed using the preserved fossils. The brain is relatively short, deep, and small, with a strong cerebral and pontine flexures and a steeply inclined posterodorsal edge when compared to those of other ornithischians. There is a small dorsal projection in the endocast where an unossified (lacking bone) region between the top of the supraoccipital (bone at the top-back of the braincase) and overlying parietal that was likely covered in cartilage. This characteristic is seen in other ornithischians. Because of the prominent flexures, many of the aspects of the brain can only be interpreted by the present structures.
In the mandible (lower jaw), only an incomplete right dentary is known from &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges. The dentary has 13 preserved alveoli on the dorsomedial side and they are slightly convex in lateral and dorsal views. On the surface adjacent to the alveoli, there is a shallow groove bearing small foramina (small openings in bone) that is similar to grooves on the dentary of the Cretaceous neornithischian &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, with one foramina per tooth position. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food. A single complete cheek tooth is preserved, with a large crown and long root. The crown notably has fewer marginal denticles and a prominent cingulum compared to &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tuojiangosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;.

===Postcrania===

The neck was composed of 13 cervical (neck) vertebrae, the first being the atlas which was strongly fused to the occipital region of the skull and followed by the axis. The other 11 cervicals had hourglass-shaped centra (the base of a vertebra) and rounded ventral keels. The diapophyses are large and strongly angled posteriorily and parallel to each other. The spinous processes got larger towards the posterior end, while the postzygapophyses became smaller and less horizontal, giving the anterior part of the neck lots of mobility laterally. The dorsal column consists of 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae which are tall and have short centra. They have a neural arch more than twice as high as the centrum, the vertebral body, and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal, a trait unique to &quot;Kentrosaurus.&quot; The diapophyses too were laterally elongated, creating a Y-shape in anterior view. The sacrum (part of pelvis with vertebrae) consists of 6 fused centra, the first being a loose sacrodorsal, while the rest of the centra&#x27;s transverse processes (extensions of bone) are fused to the dorsal parts of the sacral ribs into a solid sacral plate. The ribs also fuse to the ilium (the upper part of the pelvis) creating a fully ankylosed and solid sacrum. The ilium is notable in that the preacetabular process, front blade, of the ilium widens laterally, to the front outer side, and does not taper unlike in all other stegosaurs. Another characteristic is that the length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thigh bone. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are 29 in number, though 27-29 are coossified for attachment to the thagomizers (tail spikes). The caudal vertebrae are unique, as they have a combination of transverse processes up to the 28th vertebra and rod-shaped processes on the posterior caudals. These posterior caudal processes have narrow bases that do not tough the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; can be distinguished from other members of the Stegosauria by a number of processes of the vertebrae, which in the tail do not run sub-parallel, as in most dinosaurs. In the front third of the tail, they point backwards, the usual direction. In the middle tail, however, they are almost vertical, and further back they are hook-shaped and point obliquely forward. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have the shape of an inverted T. 

The scapula (shoulder blade) is sub-rectangular, with a robust blade. Though it is not always perfectly preserved, the acromion ridge is slightly smaller than in &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. The blade is relatively straight, although it curves towards the back. There is a small bump on the back of the blade, that would have served as the base of the triceps muscle. The coracoid is sub-circular. The fore limbs were much shorter than the stocky hind limbs, which resulted in an unusual posture. The humerus (upper arm bone), like other stegosaurs, has greatly expanded proximal and distal ends that were attachment points between the coracoid and ulna-radius (forearm bones) respectively. The radius was larger than the ulna and had a wedge-shaped proximal end. The manus (hand) was small and had five toes with 2 toes bearing only a single phalange. The hindlimbs were much larger and too are similar to those of other stegosaurs. The femur (thigh bone) is the longest element in the body, with the largest known femur measuring 665 mm from the proximal to distal end. The tibia (shin bone) was wide and robust, while the fibula was skinny and thin without a greatly expanded distal end. The pes (foot) terminated in 3 toes, all of which had hoof-like unguals (claws).

===Armour===

Typically for a stegosaur, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; had extensive osteoderm (bony structures in the skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and spikes of various shapes. The spikes of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, as if they were modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along the path of an articulated tail.

Hennig and Janensch, while grouping the dermal armour elements into four distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates at the front gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows along the back of the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs &quot;Gigantspinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;.

==Classification and species==
Like the spikes and shields of ankylosaurs, the bony plates and spines of stegosaurians evolved from the low-keeled osteoderms characteristic of basal thyreophorans. Galton (2019) interpreted plates of an armored dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic (Sinemurian-Pliensbachian) Lower Kota Formation of India as fossils of a member of Ankylosauria; the author argued that this finding indicates a probable early Early Jurassic origin for both Ankylosauria and its sister group Stegosauria.

The vast majority of stegosaurian dinosaurs thus far recovered belong to the Stegosauridae, which lived in the later part of the Jurassic and early Cretaceous, and which were defined by Paul Sereno as all stegosaurians more closely related to &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Huayangosaurus&quot;. This group is widespread, with members across the Northern Hemisphere, Africa and possibly South America. The South American remains come from Chubut, Argentina and consist only of a partial humerus, but the anatomy of the humerus is very similar to that of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; and both date to the Late Jurassic. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Chubut stegosaurid was recovered in polytomy with &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; as basal stegosaurids, further suggesting that they are closely related.

In Hennig&#x27;s 1915 description, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was assigned to the family Stegosauridae due to the preservation of dermal armor and features like posterodorsally angled neural spines on the caudal vertebrae. This is confirmed by modern cladistic analyses, although in 1915 Stegosauridae was a far more inclusive concept that included some taxa now classified as ankylosaurs. A consecutive narrowing down of this concept caused &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, until the 1980s to be seen as a typical &quot;primitive&quot; stegosaurian, to be placed in a more derived, higher, position in the stegosaur evolutionary tree. However, recent analyses have consistently found &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; to be in Stegosauridae, though typically as one of the most basal genera in the family. &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; has many traits not seen in other stegosaurids but seen in basal stegosaurians, such as the presence of a parascapular spine and maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at the margin.

The type and sole accepted species of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; is &quot;Kentrosaurus aethiopicus&quot;, named by Hennig in 1915. Fragmentary fossil material from Wyoming, named &quot;Stegosaurus longispinus&quot; by Charles Gilmore in 1914, was in 1993 classified as a North American species of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, as &quot;K. longispinus&quot;. However, this action was not accepted by the paleontological community, and &quot;S. longispinus&quot; has been assigned to its own genus, &quot;Alcovasaurus&quot;, differing from &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; in having more elongated tail spikes and the structure of the pelvis and vertebrae. Cladogram of the phylogenetic analysis of Stegosauridae conducted by Maidment &quot;et al&quot; (2019), which recovers a distinct &quot;Alcovasaurus&quot;:

==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===

Like all ornithischians, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was a herbivore. The fodder was barely chewed and swallowed in large chunks. One hypothesis on stegosaurid diet holds that they were low-level browsers, eating foliage and low-growing fruit from various non-flowering plants. &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was capable of eating at heights of up to when on all fours. It may also have been possible for it to rear up on its hindlegs to reach vegetation higher in trees.

With its centre of mass close to the hind-limbs, the animal could potentially support itself as it stood up. The hips were likely capable of allowing a vertical trunk rotation of about 60 degrees and the tail probably would either have been fully lifted, not blocking this movement or have enough curvature to rest on the ground; thus it could have provided additional support, though precisely because of this flexibility it is not certain whether much support was actually provided: it was not stiff enough to function as a &quot;third leg&quot; as had been suggested by Robert Thomas Bakker. In this pose, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; could have fed at heights of .

===Sexual dimorphism===
Differences in the proportions, not the size, of the femurs (thighbones) led Holly Barden and Susannah Maidment to realize that &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; probably showed sexual dimorphism. This dimorphism of the femurs consisted in them being either more or less robust than the other. The occurrence ratio of the robust morph to the gracile one was 2:1, and it is likely that the higher percentage of animals were females. Because of this ratio, it was considered reasonable to assume that in their society, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; males mated with more than one female, a behaviour also found in other vertebrates.

The problem posed by the ratio is that the multiple specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, it was suggested that individual difference in the sacral rib count of both &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dacentrurus&quot; might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.

===Reproduction and growth===
As the plates and spikes would have been obstacles during copulation, it is possible that pairs mated back-to-back with the female staying still in a lordosis posture as the male maneuvers his penis into her cloaca. The shoulder spikes would have made the female unable to lie on her side during mating as is proposed for &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

In 2013, a study by Ragna Redelstorff e.a. concluded that the bone histology of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; indicated that it had a higher growth rate than reported for &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot;, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; was larger than &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.

===Defense===

Because the tail had at least forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could possibly swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds at the tail end may have been as high as 50 km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.

Though &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; likely stood with forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is hypothesised that the animal adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough to allow it to keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, the thinner spikes of &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; were at greater risk of bending.

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; lived in what is now Tanzania in the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation. The main &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; quarries were located in the Middle Saurian Beds dating from the upper Kimmeridgian. Some remains were found in the Upper Saurian Beds dating from the Tithonian. Since 2012, the boundary between the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian is dated at 152.1 million year ago.

The Tendaguru ecosystem primarily consisted of three types of environment: shallow, lagoon-like marine environments, tidal flats and low coastal environments; and vegetated inland environments. The marine environment existed above the fair weather wave base and behind siliciclastic and ooid barriers. It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms. The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes, ponds and pools. These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts. The well vegetated inlands were dominated by conifers. Overall, the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods. During the Early Cretaceous, the Tendaguru became more humid. The Tendaguru Beds are similar to the Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine interbeds.

&quot;Kentrosaurus&quot; would have coexisted with fellow ornithischians like &quot;Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki&quot;; the sauropods &quot;Giraffatitan brancai&quot;, &quot;Dicraeosaurus hansemanni&quot; and &quot;D. sattleri&quot;, &quot;Janenschia africana&quot;, &quot;Tendaguria&quot; &quot;tanzaniensis&quot; and &quot;Tornieria africanus&quot;; theropods &quot;Allosaurus&quot; &quot;tendagurensis&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; &quot;roechlingi&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; &quot;ingens,&quot; &quot;Elaphrosaurus bambergi&quot;, &quot;Veterupristisaurus milneri&quot; and &quot;Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus&quot;; and the pterosaur &quot;Tendaguripterus recki&quot;. Other organisms that inhabited the Tendaguru included corals, echinoderms, cephalopods, bivalves, gastropods, decapods, sharks, neopterygian fish, crocodilians and small mammals like &quot;Brancatherulum tendagurensis&quot;.

<text>The Khasavyurt Accord (, ), formally the Khasavyourt Joint Declaration and Principles for Mutual Relations, was an agreement that marked the end of the First Chechen War, signed in Khasavyurt in Dagestan on 30 August 1996 between Alexander Lebed and Aslan Maskhadov.

== Background ==

By the time the Khasavyurt Accord was signed, Russia had suffered a significant defeat with the recapture of Grozny, the Chechen capital, by Chechen forces. With mediation by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe representative Tim Guldimann, Russian Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed and lieutenant general Konstantin Pulikovsky began mediating with Ichkerian chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov on ceasefire agreements. However, these ceasefires failed to take hold until an agreement was drafted on 22 August 1996. The agreement, signed in Novye Atagi, included the demilitarisation of Grozny, the withdrawal of both Chechen and Russian forces from the city, and the establishment of a jointly-run command to prevent looting. Eight days later, after hours of negotiations, the Khasavyurt Accords were signed.

== Contents ==
The accord consisted of four points: the establishment of relations between Russia and Chechnya, the creation of a joint Russo-Chechen committee to restore Chechen social order and prevent crime, the ensurance of legislation guaranteeing human rights and rights for ethnic minorities in Chechnya, and a guarantee that problems between Russia and Chechnya would be solved by mutual agreement. Crucially, the accord stipulated that any &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of Chechen independence by Russia would not have to be taken until late 2001.

== Aftermath ==
The Khasavyurt Accord was followed by two agreements between Ichkeria and Russia. The first, signed in mid-November 1996 by Maskhadov and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, focused on financial compensation and bilateral economic relations, while the second, signed on 12 May 1997 by Yeltsin and Maskhadov, formally established peace between Russia and Chechnya. Maskhadov said at the time that &quot;any basis to create ill-feelings between Moscow and Grozny&quot; would cease to exist as a result of the agreements. However, Maskhadov&#x27;s government was undermined by Islamic extremists over the next two years, eventually resulting in Chechen commander Shamil Basayev invading Dagestan in 1999, an event that led to the start of the Second Chechen War.

<text>Chasmosaurus ( ) is a genus of ceratopsid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period in North America. Its given name means &#x27;opening lizard&#x27;, referring to the large openings (fenestrae) in its frill (Greek &quot;chasma&quot;, meaning &#x27;opening&#x27;, &#x27;hollow&#x27;, or &#x27;gulf&#x27;; and &quot;sauros&quot;, meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;). With a length of and a weight of —or anywhere from 2,200 to nearly 5,000 lbs., give or take—&quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; was of a slightly smaller to ‘average’ size, especially when compared to larger ceratopsians (such as &quot;Triceratops&quot;, which were about the size of an African bush elephant).

It was initially to be called &quot;Protorosaurus&quot;, but this name had been previously published for another animal. All of the excavated specimens of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; were collected at the Dinosaur Park Formation, Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada. Referred specimens of &quot;C. russelli&quot; come from the lower beds of the formation, while &quot;C. belli&quot; comes from the middle and upper beds.

==Discovery and species==
In 1898, at Berry Creek, Alberta, Lawrence Morris Lambe of the Geological Survey of Canada made the first discovery of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; remains; holotype NMC 491, a parietal bone that was part of a neck frill. Although recognizing that his find represented a new species, Lambe thought this could be placed in a previously known short-frilled ceratopsian genus: &quot;Monoclonius&quot;. He erected the new species &quot;Monoclonius belli&quot; to describe his findings. The specific name honoured collector Walter Bell.

However, in 1913, Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his sons found several complete &quot;M. belli&quot; skulls in the middle Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada. Based on these finds, Lambe (1914) erected &quot;Protorosaurus&quot; (&quot;before &quot;Torosaurus&quot;&quot;), but that name was preoccupied by the Permian reptile &quot;Protorosaurus&quot;, so he subsequently created the replacement name &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; in February 1914. The name &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; is derived from Greek χάσμα, &quot;khasma&quot;, &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;divide&quot; and refers to the very large parietal fenestrae in the skull frill. Lambe now also assigned a paratype, specimen NMC 2245 found by the Sternbergs in 1913 and consisting of a largely complete skeleton, including skin impressions.

Since that date, more remains, including skulls, have been found that have been referred to &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;, and several additional species have been named within the genus. Today some of these are considered to only reflect a morphological variation among the known sample of &quot;Chasmosaurus belli&quot; skulls; others are seen as valid species of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; or as separate genera. In 1933 Barnum Brown named &quot;Chasmosaurus kaiseni&quot;, honouring Peter Kaisen and based on skull AMNH 5401, differing from &quot;C. belli&quot; in having very long brow horns. This form is perhaps related to &quot;Chasmosaurus canadensis&quot; (&#x27;from Canada&#x27;) named by Thomas M. Lehman in 1990. The latter species, originally&quot; Monoclonius canadensis&quot; Lambe 1902, had been described as &quot;Eoceratops canadensis&quot; by Lambe in 1915. &quot;Eoceratops&quot; and the long-horned &quot;Chasmosaurus kaiseni&quot; were thought to probably be exemplars of &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; by Nicholas Longrich, although different teams of researchers have found &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; to be a synonym of &quot;Chasmosaurus russelli&quot;. Campbell and colleagues, in their 2016 analysis of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; specimens found &quot;Eoceratops&quot; and &quot;C. kaiseni&quot; to be referable to &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; sp. due to the lack of the parietal preserved in the holotypes of both. Richard Swann Lull in 1933 named an unusual, short-muzzled skull, specimen ROM 839 (earlier ROM 5436) collected in 1926, as &quot;Chasmosaurus brevirostris&quot;, &quot;with a short snout&quot;. This has been seen as a junior synonym of &quot;C. belli&quot;.

Charles Mortram Sternberg added &quot;Chasmosaurus russelli&quot; in 1940, based on specimen NMC 8800 from southwestern Alberta (lower Dinosaur Park Formation). The specific name honours Loris Shano Russell. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul renamed &quot;Pentaceratops sternbergii&quot; into &quot;Chasmosaurus sternbergi&quot;, but this has found no acceptance. In 2000, George Olshevsky renamed &quot;Monoclonius recurvicornis&quot; Cope 1889 into &quot;Chasmosaurus recurvicornis&quot; as its fossil material is likely chasmosaurine; this is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Thomas Lehman described &quot;Chasmosaurus mariscalensis&quot; in 1989 from Texas, which has now been renamed &quot;Agujaceratops&quot;. 

The most recently described species is &quot;Chasmosaurus irvinensis&quot; named in 2001, which stems from the uppermost beds of the Dinosaur Park Formation. This species was given its own genus, &quot;Vagaceratops&quot;, in 2010. However, Campbell et al. (2019) referred &quot;Vagaceratops&quot; back to &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;. As Fowler and Fowler found &quot;Vagaceratops&quot; likely to be the sister taxon of &quot;Kosmoceratops&quot; in 2020, they suggested it should be maintained as a distinct genus from &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;, as its placement would probably remain unstable until chasmosaurines are better understood.

The species &quot;Mojoceratops perifania&quot; was based on holotype specimen TMP 1983.25.1 consisting of a partial skull including the parietal and from the paratypes TMP 1999.55.292, an isolated lateral ramus of a right parietal, and NMC 8803, central bar and lateral rami of parietals. Specimens AMNH 5656, NMC 34832 and TMP 1979.11.147, and (tentatively) AMNH 5401 and NMC 1254 were also referred to the genus. All specimens assigned to &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; were collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5–75 ma) of the Belly River Group of Alberta and Saskatchewan, western Canada. &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; was named by Nicholas R. Longrich in 2010 and the type species is &quot;Mojoceratops perifania&quot;. The generic name is derived from mojo and the specific name means &quot;conspicuous pride&quot; in Greek, both referring to the skull frill. The species is based on fossils thought by other researchers to belong to &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;.

The species &quot;Chasmosaurus kaiseni&quot;, known from specimen AMNH 5401, a nearly complete (but partially restored) skull on display at the American Museum of Natural History, was considered to share features in common with &quot;Mojoceratops perifania&quot; and therefore was considered a possible synonym. However, the parietal (back margin of the frill) is not preserved, and was restored with plaster based on specimens of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;, which caused confusion among scientists in previous decades, because the parietal bone is critical for determining differences between species in ceratopsids like &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; and &quot;Mojoceratops&quot;. &quot;Chasmosaurus kaiseni&quot; was then by Longrich regarded as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, rather than as the senior synonym of &quot;M. perifania&quot;. Longrich also regarded the holotype of &quot;Eoceratops&quot; as probably being an exemplar of &quot;Mojoceratops&quot;. He considered it too poorly preserved for a reliable determination, especially as it belonged to a juvenile individual, and regarded it too as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, rather than as the senior synonym of &quot;M. perifania&quot;. A 2016 overview of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; found &quot;C. kaiseni&quot; and &quot;Eoceratops&quot; to be referable to &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; sp. due to the lack of the parietal preserved in the holotypes of both.

Following the original assignment of the holotype and other skulls to &quot;Mojoceratops&quot;, several teams of researchers published work questioning the validity of this new genus. In 2011, Maidment &amp; Barrett failed to confirm the presence of any supposedly unique features, and argued that &quot;Mojoceratops perifania&quot; was a synonym of &quot;Chasmosaurus russelli&quot;. Campbell and colleagues, in their 2016 analysis of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; specimens, agreed with the conclusions of Maidment &amp; Barrett, adding that some supposedly unique features, such as grooves on the parietal bone, were actually also present in the holotype of &quot;C. russelli&quot; and, to various degrees, in other &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; specimens. This variability, they argued, strongly suggested that &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; was simply a mature growth stage of &quot;C. russelli&quot;. Recently, the referral of &quot;Eoceratops&quot;, &quot;C. kaiseni,&quot; and &quot;Mojoceratops&quot; to &quot;C. russelli&quot; was considered doubtful as the holotype of &quot;C. russelli&quot; is actually from the upper Dinosaur Park Formation, according to recent fieldwork. This situation is further complicated since &quot;C. russelli&quot; may not even belong to the genus &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;, sharing features with the contemporaneous derived chasmosaurine &quot;Utahceratops.&quot;

Today, taxonomy of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; is in a state of flux. For the aforementioned reasons, it is likely that &quot;Mojoceratops, Eoceratops,&quot; and &quot;C. kaiseni&quot; belong to a distinct species, if not genus, of chasmosaurine. Specimens referred to &quot;C. russelli&quot; are all from the lower Dinosaur Park Formation, stratigraphically and morphologically separate from &quot;C. belli.&quot; Apart from the holotype and paratype several additional specimens of &quot;C. belli&quot; are known. These include AMNH 5422, ROM 843 (earlier ROM 5499) and NHMUK R4948, all (partial) skeletons with skull. The skull YPM 2016 and the skull and skeleton AMNH 5402 were noted by Campbell et al. (2016) as differing from other &quot;C. belli&quot; referred specimens in having more epiparietals, although the authors interpreted them as individual variation, but this was reconsidered when Campbell et al. (2019) interpreted these specimens as an indeterminate &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; species closely related to &quot;Vagaceratops&quot;. The specimen CMN 2245 was referred to the &quot;Vagaceratops-&quot;like &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; species by Fowler and Freedman Fowler (2020), who noted that &quot;given the similarity between these two specimens (YPM 2016 and AMNH 5402) and CMN 2245, it is not clear why CMN 2245 was left in &quot;C. belli&quot;.&quot;

In 2015, Nicholas Longrich presented a novel theory that posits &quot;C. belli&quot; and &quot;C. russelli&quot; are synonymous, while splitting some remains assigned to the latter to a new species, &quot;C. priscus&quot;. Because the publication was rejected, &quot;C.&quot; &quot;priscus&quot; remains a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;; however, the name appeared in the pre-proof of the description of &quot;Sierraceratops&quot; before being edited out for final publication.

==Description==

&quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; was a medium-size ceratopsid. In 2010 G.S. Paul estimated the length of &quot;C. belli&quot; at 4.8 metres, its weight at two tonnes; &quot;C. russelli&quot; would have been 4.3 metres long and weighed 1.5 tonnes. 
The known differences between the two species mainly pertain to the horn and frill shape, as the referred postcrania of &quot;C. russelli&quot; are poorly known. Like many ceratopsians, &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; had three main facial horns - one on the nose and two on the brow. In both species these horns are quite short, but with &quot;C. russelli&quot; they are somewhat longer, especially the brow horns, and more curved backwards. The frill of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; is very elongated and broader at the rear than at the front. It is hardly elevated from the plane of the snout. With &quot;C. belli&quot; the rear of the frill is V-shaped and its sides are straight. With &quot;C. russelli&quot; the rear edge is shaped as a shallow U, and the sides are more convex. The sides were adorned by six to nine smaller skin ossifications (called episquamosals) or osteoderms, which attached to the squamosal bone. The corner of the frill featured two larger osteoderms on the parietal bone. With &quot;C. russelli&quot; the outer one was the largest, with &quot;C. belli&quot; the inner one. The remainder of the rear edge lacked osteoderms. The parietal bones of the frill were pierced by very large openings, after which the genus was named: the parietal fenestrae. These were not oval in shape, as with most relatives, but triangular, with one point orientated towards the frill corner.

The postcranium of &quot;C. belli&quot; is best preserved in the specimen known as NHMUK 4948. The first three cervical vertebrae are fused into a unit known as a syncervical, as in other neoceratopsians. There are five other cervicals preserved in this specimen, for a total of eight, which likely represents a complete neck. Cervicals four to eight are , wider than long, and roughly equal in length. The dorsal vertebrae are also amphiplatian. &quot;C. belli&quot; possessed a , a compound unit composed of sacral, dorsal, and sometimes vertebrae, depending on the specimen.

The &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; specimen NMC 2245 recovered by C.M. Sternberg was accompanied by skin impressions. The area conserved, from the right hip region, measured about one by 0.5 metres. The skin appears to have had large scales in evenly spaced horizontal rows among smaller scales. The larger scales had a diameter of up to fifty-five millimetres and were distanced from each other by five to ten centimetres. They were hexagonal or pentagonal, thus with five or six sides. Each of these sides touched somewhat smaller scales, forming a rosette. Small, non-overlapping convex scales of about one centimetre in diameter surrounded the whole. The larger scales were wrinkled due to straight grooves orientated perpendicular to their edges. From top to bottom, the large scale rows gradually declined in size. Unfortunately, nothing can as yet be learned about the coloration of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; from the known fossil skin impression samples.

==Classification==

&quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; was in 1915 by Lambe within the Ceratopsia assigned to the Chasmosaurinae. The Chasmosaurinae usually have long frills, like &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; itself, whereas their sister-group the Centrosaurinae typically have shorter frills. Most cladistic analyses show that &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; has a basal position in the Chasmosaurinae.S
The following cladogram shows the phylogeny of &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; according to a study by Scott Sampson e.a. in 2010.
==Paleobiology==

&quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; shared its habitat, the east coast of Laramidia, with successive species of &quot;Centrosaurus&quot;. A certain niche partitioning is suggested by the fact that &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; had a longer snout and jaws and might have been more selective about the plants it ate.

The function of the frill and horns is problematic. The horns are rather short and the frill had such large fenestrae that it could not have offered much functional defense. Paul suggested that the beak was the main defensive weapon. It is possible that the frill was simply used to appear imposing or conceivably for thermoregulation. The frill may also have been brightly colored, to draw attention to its size or as part of a mating display. However, it is difficult to prove any sexual dimorphism. In 1933, Lull suggested that &quot;C. kaiseni&quot;, which bore long brow horns, was in fact the male of &quot;C. belli&quot; of which the females would have short ones. In 1927 C.M. Sternberg concluded that of the two skeletons he had mounted in the Canadian Museum of Nature, the smaller one, NMC 2245, was the male and the larger, NMC 2280, the female. However, today the two are referred to different species.

A juvenile &quot;Chasmosaurus belli&quot; found in Alberta, Canada by Phil Currie et al., reveals that &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; may have cared for its young, like its relative, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, is hypothesized to have done. The juvenile measured five feet long and was estimated to be three years of age and had similar limb proportions to the adult &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;. This indicates that &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot; was not fast moving, and that juveniles did not need to be fast moving either to keep pace with adults. The fossil was complete save for its missing front limbs, which had fallen into a sinkhole before the specimen was uncovered. Skin impressions were also uncovered beneath the skeleton and evidence from the matrix that it was buried in indicated that the juvenile ceratopsian drowned during a possible river crossing. Further study of the specimen revealed that juvenile chasmosaurs had a frill that was narrower in the back than that of adults, as well as being proportionately shorter in relation to the skull.

<doc id="1005304" wikidata="Q2248008" url="?curid=1005304" title="Niger uranium forgeries">
<text>The Niger uranium forgeries were forged documents initially released in 2001 by SISMI (the former military intelligence agency of Italy), which seem to depict an attempt made by Saddam Hussein in Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium powder from Niger during the Iraq disarmament crisis. On the basis of these documents and other indicators, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom asserted that Iraq violated United Nations sanctions against Iraq by attempting to procure nuclear material for the purpose of creating weapons of mass destruction.

== Abbreviated timetable ==
The first report of these documents was in a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Senior Executive Intelligence brief dated 18 October 2001, entitled: &quot;Iraq: Nuclear Related Procurement Efforts&quot;. This information was not considered to be certain and not much was done to promote this claim right away.

These documents were sent to the CIA office in Rome by SISMI.

On 10 May 2002, the CIA&#x27;s Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis (NESA) in the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) prepared a Principals Committee briefing book updating the status of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. The document noted that a &quot;foreign government service says Iraq was trying to acquire 500 tons of uranium from Niger&quot;.

On 22 July 2002, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) published an intelligence product (&quot;Daily Intelligence Highlight, Nuclear Reconstitution Efforts Underway?&quot;) which highlighted the intelligence on the Iraq-Niger uranium deal as one of three indications that Iraq might be reconstituting its nuclear program.

=== Second and third dissemination ===

There was a second and third dissemination of these forged documents to the United States by SISMI in early September 2002. One source was a suspicious &quot;ex-agent&quot; of SISMI who occasionally worked on and off for them, who was selling the documents.
Far more officially, Nicolò Pollari, chief of SISMI, brought the Niger yellowcake story directly to the White House, meeting secretly in Washington on 9 September 2002, with then–Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. In that month, the claims of Saddam trying to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger became much stronger. In September 2002, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) published an intelligence assessment (&quot;Defense Intelligence Assessment, Iraq&#x27;s Reemerging Nuclear Program&quot;) which outlined Iraq&#x27;s recent efforts to rebuild its nuclear program including uranium acquisition. On this issue, the assessment said &quot;Iraq has been vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake.&quot;

On 11 September 2002, National Security Council (NSC) staff contacted the CIA to clear language for possible use by President Bush. The language cleared by the CIA said, &quot;Iraq has made several attempts to buy high strength aluminum tubes used in centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. And we also know this: within the past few years, Iraq has resumed efforts to obtain large quantities of a type of uranium oxide known as yellowcake, which is an essential ingredient of this process.&quot;

In October 2002 the Intelligence Community (IC) produced a classified, 90-page National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq&#x27;s WMD programmes which cited reports that Iraq began &quot;vigorously trying to procure&quot; more uranium from Niger, as well as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Yellowcake and Niger were not specifically mentioned in this speech. There are many reports of a struggle about this, saying the Niger uranium claims were initially in this Cincinnati speech but taken out by the insistence of the CIA Director George Tenet.

== Iraq and WMD ==
In late 2002, the Bush administration began soliciting support for war in Iraq using the political slogan &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to refer to what later became the Multinational Force – Iraq. To back up its claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, that administration referred to intelligence from Italy, Britain, and France detailing interactions between Saddam Hussein and the governments of Niger, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Specifically, CIA director George Tenet and United States Secretary of State Colin Powell both cited attempts by Hussein to obtain uranium from Niger in their September testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time, using information derived from the same source, the UK government also publicly reported an attempted purchase from an (unnamed) &quot;African country&quot;. In December, the United States Department of State issued a fact sheet listing the alleged Niger yellowcake affair in a report entitled &quot;Illustrative Examples of Omissions From the Iraqi Declaration to the United Nations Security Council&quot;.

== Initial doubts ==
The classified documents detailing an Iraqi approach to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger were considered dubious by some analysts in US intelligence, according to news accounts. Days before the Iraq invasion, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) voiced serious doubt on the authenticity of the documents to the UN Security Council, judging them counterfeit.

== &quot;Sixteen Words&quot; controversy in 2003 State of the Union ==
In his January 2003 State of the Union speech, U.S. President George W. Bush said, &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot; This single sentence is now known as &quot;the &quot;Sixteen Words&quot;&quot;.
The administration later conceded that evidence in support of the claim was inconclusive and stated, &quot;These sixteen words should never have been included.&quot; The administration attributed the error to the CIA. In mid-2003, the US government declassified the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, which contained a dissenting opinion published by the US Department of State stating that the intelligence connecting Niger to Saddam Hussein was &quot;highly suspect&quot;, primarily because State Department&#x27;s intelligence agency analysts did not believe that Niger would be likely to engage in such a transaction due to a French consortium which maintained close control over the Nigerien uranium industry.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, when occupying troops found no evidence of a current nuclear program, the statement and how it came to be in the speech became a focus for critics in Washington and foreign capitals to press the case that the White House manipulated facts to take the United States to war. The &quot;Post&quot; reported, &quot;Dozens of interviews with current and former intelligence officials and policymakers in the United States, Britain, France and Italy show that the Bush administration disregarded key information available at the time showing that the Iraq–Niger claim was highly questionable.&quot; With the release of the 2002 NIE report, the Bush administration was criticized for including the statement in the State of the Union despite CIA and State Department reports questioning its veracity.

== European and French intelligence reports ==
The front page of the 28 June 2004 &quot;Financial Times&quot; carried a report from their national security correspondent, Mark Huband, describing that between 1999 and 2001, three unnamed European intelligence services were aware that Niger was possibly engaged in illicit negotiations over the export of its uranium ore with North Korea, Libya, Iraq, Iran, and China. &quot;The same information was passed to the US&quot; but American officials decided not to include it in their assessment, Huband added in a follow-up report.

French intelligence informed the United States a year before President Bush&#x27;s State of the Union address that the allegation could not be supported with hard evidence.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; dated 1 August 2004 contains an interview with an Italian source describing his role in the forgeries. The source said he was sorry to have played a role in passing along false intelligence.

Although the claims made in the British intelligence report regarding Iraq&#x27;s interest in yellowcake ore from Niger were never withdrawn, the CIA and Department of State could not verify them and are said to have thought the claims were &quot;highly dubious&quot;.

== US doubts ==
Previously, in February 2002, three different American officials had made efforts to verify the reports. The deputy commander of US Armed Forces Europe, Marine General Carlton W. Fulford, Jr., went to Niger and met with the country&#x27;s president, Tandja Mamadou. He concluded that, given the controls on Niger&#x27;s uranium supply, there was little chance any of it could have been diverted to Iraq. His report was sent to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Myers. The US Ambassador to Niger, Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick, was also present at the meeting and sent similar conclusions to the State Department. CNN reported on 14 March 2003 (before invasion) that the International Atomic Energy Agency found the documents to be forged.

== Wilson and Niger ==

In late February 2002, the CIA sent Ambassador Joseph Wilson to investigate the claims himself. Wilson had been posted to Niger 14 years earlier, and throughout a diplomatic career in Africa he had built up a large network of contacts in Niger. Wilson interviewed former prime minister of Niger, Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, who reported that he knew of no attempted sales to Iraq. Mayaki did however recall that in June 1999 an Iraqi delegation had expressed interest in &quot;expanding commercial relations&quot;, which he had interpreted to mean yellowcake sales.
Ultimately, Wilson concluded that there was no way that production at the uranium mines could be ramped up or that the excess uranium could have been exported without it being immediately obvious to many people both in the private sector and in the government of Niger. He returned home and told the CIA that the reports were &quot;unequivocally wrong&quot;. The CIA retained this information in its Counter Proliferation Department and it was not passed up to the CIA Director, according to the unanimous findings of the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s July 2004 report.

=== Criticism ===
Former Ambassador Wilson had claimed that he found no evidence of Saddam Hussein ever attempting or buying yellowcake uranium from Niger on his trip to Niger.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence suggested that the evidence Wilson found could be interpreted differently:

Wilson has responded to criticism by observing that uranium was not actually discussed at the 1999 meeting. On &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, for example, Wilson stated:

==Panorama article==
Carlo Rossella, the editor of &quot;Panorama&quot;, published the documents during the third week of September 2002 and passed them to the American embassy in Rome in October 2002.

== CIA doubts ==
In early October 2002, George Tenet called Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley to ask him to remove reference to the Niger uranium from a speech Bush was to give in Cincinnati on 7 October. This was followed up by a memo asking Hadley to remove another, similar line. Another memo was sent to the White House expressing the CIA&#x27;s view that the Niger claims were false; this memo was given to both Hadley and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice.

== Wilson and Plame ==
Retired ambassador Joseph C. Wilson wrote a critical op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which he explained the nature of the documents and the government&#x27;s prior knowledge of their unreliability for use in a case for war. Shortly after Wilson&#x27;s op-ed, in a column by Robert Novak, in pondering why a State Department employee was dispatched rather than a trained CIA agent, the identity of Wilson&#x27;s wife, CIA analyst Valerie Plame, was revealed. The Senate Intelligence Committee report and other sources confirm that Plame &quot;offered his name up&quot; to her superiors.

== IAEA analysis ==
Further, in March 2003, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released results of his analysis of the documents. Reportedly, it took IAEA officials only a matter of hours to determine that these documents were fake. IAEA experts discovered indications of a crude forgery, such as the use of incorrect names of Nigerien officials. As a result, the IAEA reported to the U.N. Security Council that the documents were &quot;in fact not authentic&quot;. The UN spokesman wrote:

== British inquiries ==

=== Foreign Affairs Committee ===
The first British investigation into this matter was conducted by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee (FAC). The committee comprises fourteen Members of Parliament from government and opposition parties, and has permanent cross-party support. They examined and tested several key claims in the September Dossier, &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Assessment of the British Government&quot;, including the topic of uranium acquisition.

In June and July, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw testified that the claim in the dossier rested on separate evidence to the fraudulent documents, and that this specific intelligence, obtained from a foreign government, was still under review and had not been shared with the CIA. In written evidence to the same committee, Straw further disclosed that the separate intelligence information upon which the British Government had based its conclusion, was also briefed to the IAEA by a foreign intelligence service that owned the reporting, shortly before IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei&#x27;s statement to the UN Security Council on 7 March 2003. This was further confirmed in a parliamentary answer to Lynne Jones MP. Lynne Jones subsequently contacted the IAEA to question whether a third party had discussed or shared separate intelligence with them and, if so, what assessment they made of it. IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky responded to Jones in May 2004:

I can confirm to you that we have received information from a number of member states regarding the allegation that Iraq sought to acquire uranium from Niger. However, we have learned nothing which would cause us to change the conclusion we reported to the United Nations Security Council on March 7, 2003 with regards to the documents assessed to be forgeries and have not received any information that would appear to be based on anything other than those documents.

After talking with numerous witnesses and considering much evidence, the committee judged the evidence that Iraq was trying to procure uranium was not sufficiently strong enough to justify absolute terms.

We conclude that it is very odd indeed that the Government asserts that it was not relying on the evidence which has since been shown to have been forged, but that eight months later it is still reviewing the other evidence. The assertion &quot;... that Iraq sought the supply of significant amounts of uranium from Africa ...&quot; should have been qualified to reflect the uncertainty.

=== Butler Committee ===

The Butler Committee, appointed by then Prime Minister Tony Blair, concluded that the report Saddam&#x27;s government was seeking uranium in Africa appeared &quot;well-founded&quot;:

The review however was itself mired in controversy leading both opposition parties to end their participation and leaving Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party as the only party involved with the review.

== More doubts ==
In January 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed the existence of a memo which stated that the suggestion of uranium being sold was &quot;unlikely&quot; because of a host of economic, diplomatic and logistical obstacles. The memo, dated 4 March 2002, was distributed at senior levels by the office of former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

== Statements by Wilson ==
In a July 2003 op-ed, Ambassador Wilson recounted his experiences and stated &quot;I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat&quot;.

Wilson told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; anonymously in June 2003 that he had concluded that the intelligence about the Niger uranium was based on the forged documents because &quot;the dates were wrong and the names were wrong.&quot; However, the relevant papers were not in CIA hands until eight months after Wilson made his trip. Wilson had to backtrack and said he may have &quot;misspoken&quot; on this.
 The Senate intelligence committee, which examined pre-Iraq war intelligence, reported that Wilson &quot;had never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names and dates were in the reports.&quot;

== Origin of forged documents ==
No one has been convicted of forging the documents. Various theories have been reported on how they were produced, distributed, and where pressure was applied to keep their fraudulent nature a secret.

=== Funneled through former Italian intelligence agent ===
By late 2003, the trail of the documents had been partially uncovered. They were obtained by a &quot;security consultant&quot; (and former agent of the precursor agency to SISMI, the SID), Rocco Martino, from Italian military intelligence (SISMI).
An article in &quot;The Times&quot; (London) quoted Martino as having received the documents from a woman on the staff of the Niger embassy (located in a tiny apartment in Rome), after a meeting was arranged by a serving SISMI agent. Martino later recanted and said he had been misquoted, and that SISMI had not facilitated the meeting where he obtained the documents. It was later revealed that Martino had been invited to serve as the conduit for the documents by Col. Antonio Nucera of SISMI, the head of the counterintelligence and WMD proliferations sections of SISMI&#x27;s Rome operations center.

Martino, in turn, offered them to Italian journalist Elisabetta Burba. On instructions from her editor at &quot;Panorama&quot;, Burba offered them to the U.S. Embassy in Rome in October 2002. Burba was dissuaded by the editors of the Berlusconi-owned Panorama from investigating the source of the forgeries.

An August 2004 &quot;Financial Times&quot; article indicated French officials may have had a role in the forged documents coming to light. The article states:

The &quot;Times&quot; article also stated that &quot;French officials have not said whether they know Mr Martino, and are unlikely to either confirm or deny that he is a source&quot;.

=== Current or former United States Executive Branch employees ===
It is as yet unknown how Italian intelligence came by the documents and why they were not given directly to the US.
According to a 2003 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Seymour Hersh, the forgery may have been a deliberate entrapment by current and former CIA officers to settle a score against Cheney and other neoconservatives. Hersh recounts how a former officer told him that &quot;somebody deliberately let something false get in there.&quot; Hersh continues:

In an interview published 7 April 2005, Cannistraro was asked by Ian Masters what he would say if it were asserted that the source of the forgery was former National Security Council and State Department consultant Michael Ledeen. (Ledeen had also allegedly been a liaison between the United States Intelligence Community and SISMI two decades earlier.) Cannistraro answered by saying: &quot;you&#x27;d be very close&quot;. Ledeen has denied this in an article which mentions, though, that he has worked for the aforementioned &quot;Panorama&quot; magazine.

In an interview on 26 July 2005, Cannistraro&#x27;s business partner and columnist for the &quot;American Conservative&quot; magazine, former CIA counter terrorism officer Philip Giraldi, confirmed to Scott Horton that the forgeries were produced by &quot;a couple of former CIA officers who are familiar with that part of the world who are associated with a certain well-known neoconservative who has close connections with Italy&quot;. When Horton said that must be Ledeen, he confirmed it, and added that the ex-CIA officers &quot;also had some equity interests, shall we say, with the operation. A lot of these people are in consulting positions, and they get various, shall we say, emoluments in overseas accounts, and that kind of thing&quot;.

In a second interview with Horton, Giraldi elaborated to say that Ledeen and his former CIA friends worked with Ahmad Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress. &quot;These people did it probably for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons was that these people were involved, through the neoconservatives, with the Iraqi National Congress and Chalabi and had a financial interest in cranking up the pressure against Saddam Hussein and potentially going to war with him.&quot;

=== Current and former Italian intelligence employees ===
The suggestion of a plot by CIA officers is countered by a series of articles in the Italian newspaper . Investigative reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe d&#x27;Avanzo report that Nicolò Pollari, chief of Italy&#x27;s military intelligence service, SISMI, brought the Niger yellowcake story directly to the White House after his insistent overtures had been rejected by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2001 and 2002. SISMI had reported to the CIA on 15 October 2001, that Iraq had sought yellowcake in Niger, a report it also plied on British intelligence, creating an echo that the Niger forgeries themselves purported to amplify before they were exposed as a hoax.

Pollari met secretly in Washington on 9 September 2002, with then–Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. Their secret meeting came at a critical moment in the White House campaign to convince Congress and the American public that war in Iraq was necessary to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing nuclear weapons. What may be most significant to American observers, however, is &quot;La Repubblica&quot;&#x27;s allegation that the Italians sent the bogus intelligence about Niger and Iraq not only through traditional allied channels such as the CIA, but seemingly directly into the White House. That direct White House channel amplifies questions about the 16-word reference to the uranium from Africa in President Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union address—which remained in the speech despite warnings from the CIA and the State Department that the allegation was not substantiated.

== Aftermath ==
In March 2003, Senator Jay Rockefeller, vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, agreed not to open a congressional investigation of the matter, but rather asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct the investigation.

In 2003, unidentified &quot;senior officials&quot; in the administration leaked word to columnist Robert Novak that Wilson&#x27;s wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA operative. The CIA requested an investigation into whether this public disclosure was illegal, thus the Niger uranium controversy spawned an ongoing legal investigation and political scandal.

In September 2004, the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; decided to delay a major story on the forgeries because such a broadcast might influence the 2004 U.S. presidential election. A CBS spokesman stated, &quot;We now believe it would be inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election.&quot; This decision closely followed the Killian documents controversy.

Nicolò Pollari, director of the SISMI intelligence agency, told an Italian parliamentary intelligence committee that the dossier came from Rocco Martino, a former Italian spy.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on 3 December 2005, that the FBI reopened the inquiry into &quot;how the Bush administration came to rely on forged documents linking Iraq to nuclear weapons materials as part of its justification for the invasion.&quot; According to the Times, &quot;a senior FBI official said the bureau&#x27;s initial investigation found no evidence of foreign government involvement in the forgeries, but the FBI did not interview Martino, a central figure in a parallel drama unfolding in Rome.&quot;

=== Removal of known yellowcake ===
In 2008, the United States facilitated shipping yellowcake (refined uranium ore) out of Iraq. This yellowcake had been stockpiled prior to the first Gulf War, and was declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency and under IAEA safeguards. More than 550 tons of yellowcake was removed from Iraq and eventually shipped to Canada.

<doc id="1005308" wikidata="Q1797763" url="?curid=1005308" title="Angakkuq">
<text>The Inuit angakkuq (plural: &quot;angakkuit&quot;, Inuktitut syllabics ᐊᖓᑦᑯᖅ or ᐊᖓᒃᑯᖅ; Inuvialuktun: &quot;&quot;; , &quot;angakkut&quot;; Iñupiaq: &quot;aŋatkuq&quot;) is an intellectual and spiritual figure in Inuit culture who corresponds to a medicine man. Other cultures, including Alaska Natives, have traditionally had similar spiritual mediators, although the Alaska Native religion has many forms and variants.

==Role in Inuit society==
Both women, such as Uvavnuk, and men could become an angakkuq, although it was rarer for women to do so. The process for becoming an angakkuq varied widely. The son of a current angakkuq might be trained by his father to become one as well. A shaman might make a prophecy that a particular infant would become a prophet in adulthood. Alternatively, a young man or woman who exhibited a predilection or power that made them stand out might be trained by an experienced mentor. There are also instances of angakkuit claiming to have been called to the role through dreams or visions. Mistreated orphans or people who had survived hard times might also become angakkuit with the help of the spirits of their dead loved ones. 

Training to become an angakkuq consisted of acculturation to the rites and roles necessary for the position, as well as instruction in the special language of the angakkuit, which consisted largely of an archaic vocabulary and oral tradition that was shared across much of the Arctic areas the Inuit occupied. During their training, the angakkuq would also gain a familiar or spirit guide who would be visible only to them. This guide, called a &quot;tuurngaq&quot; in the Inuit religion, would at times give them extraordinary powers. Inuit stories tell of agakkuit who could run as fast as caribou, or who could fly, with the assistance of their tuurngaq. In some traditions, the angakkuq would be either stabbed or shot, receiving no wound because of the intervention of their tuurngaq, thus proving their power.

Until spiritual guidance or assistance was needed, an angakkuq lived a normal life for an Inuit, participating in society as a normal person. But when sickness needed to be cured, or divination of the causes of various misfortunes was needed, the angakkuq would be called on. The services of angakkuit might also be required to interpret dreams. If they were called to perform actions that helped the entire village, the work was usually done freely. But if they were called to help an individual or family, they would usually receive remuneration for their efforts. 

Amongst the Inuit, there are notions comparable to laws:
* &quot;tirigusuusiit&quot;, things to avoid
* &quot;maligait&quot;, things to follow
* &quot;piqujait&quot;, things to do
If these three are not obeyed, then the angakkuq may need to intervene with the offending party in order to avoid harmful consequence to the person or group. Breaking these laws or taboos was seen as the cause of misfortune, such as bad weather, accidents, or unsuccessful hunts. In order to pinpoint the cause of such misfortune, the angakkuq would undertake a spirit-guided journey outside of their body. They would discover the cause of the misfortune on this journey. Once they returned from the journey, the angakkuq would question people involved in the situation, and, under the belief that they already knew who was responsible, the people being questioned would often confess. This confession alone could be declared the solution to the problem, or acts of penance such as cleaning the urine pots or swapping wives might be necessary.

The angakkuit of the central Inuit participated in an annual ceremony to appease the mythological figure Sedna, the Sea Woman. The Inuit believed that Sedna became angry when her taboos were broken, and the only way to appease her was for an angakkuq to travel in spirit to the underworld where she lived, Adlivun, and smooth out her hair. According to myth, this was of great assistance to Sedna because she lacks fingers. The angakkuq would then beg or fight with Sedna to ensure that his people would not starve, and the Inuit believed that his pleading and apologies on behalf of his people would allow the animals to return and hunters to be successful. After returning from this spirit journey, communities in which the rite was practiced would have communal confessions, and then celebration.

== Auxiliary spirits and personal names ==
Angakkuit often had associations with entities that Canadian anthropologist and ethnographer Bernard Saladin d&#x27;Anglure referred to as &quot;auxiliary spirits&quot;. These spirits could be the souls of the deceased or non-human entities, and each had an individual name, which could be used to invoke that spirit. When a birth was particularly dangerous, or an infant could not be quieted down, it was believed that a dead family member was trying to live again through the infant, and that the infant should be named for that person. In cases where the family was not able to determine the name of the deceased person, perhaps because the infant&#x27;s condition was too grave to provide enough time, the angakkuq could name the infant for one of their auxiliary spirits, providing the child with life-saving vigor. Saladin d&#x27;Anglure reported that such children would be more likely to become shamans, connected by name to that auxiliary spirit. Sometimes the name given would be that of a non-human spirit; the individual might then identify with that spirit later in life.

Name and identity could be more fluid in adulthood, and at times of crisis a shaman might ritually rename a person; going forward, their old name would be considered an auxiliary spirit. This sometimes served as an initiation into shamanism for the renamed person. Saladin d&#x27;Anglure describes one such situation: a man called Nanuq (&quot;polar bear&quot;) had been named for an older cousin. When the cousin died, the younger man was distraught and felt that he, too, had suffered a death. A shaman brought a new name for him from the dream world, which he adopted. Going forward, he was called Qimuksiraaq, and his old name and identity, Nanuq, was considered to be an auxiliary spirit associated with polar bears. Following this, Qimuksiraaq took on the identity of an angakkuq.

Finally, an angakkuq might pass on their own personal name to their descendants, either before or after their death. In posthumous cases, the shaman might appear in a dream and direct the family personally, or the family might decide to honor the angakkuq of their own accord to maintain their link to the family. A person who was named for a shaman might inherit some of their spiritual powers, but was not necessarily bound to become a shaman themselves.

== &quot;Angakkuuniq&quot; today ==

Traditional Inuit spirituality, including the role of shamanism (&quot;angakkuuniq&quot;), continues as part of Inuit cosmology and world-view today, although modified through contact with Christianity. A 2002 research and interview project with Inuit elders, found that while some Inuit reject shamanism out of Christian belief, others advocate for it, sometimes using Christian concepts, as a matter of preserving traditional identity and ways of life. The elders reported that &quot;angakkuit&quot; continue to practise in contemporary Inuit communities. Some practices of &quot;angakkuuniq&quot; may be proceeding today in hiding, which is not out of keeping with the discretion with which &quot;angakkuuniq&quot; was traditionally practised. The elders interviewed in 2002, while emphasizing that they were Christian, proposed that Christian ministry and &quot;angakkuuniq&quot; could each have their own differing benefits. They felt that although &quot;angakkuuniq&quot; came from the past, knowledge of it should be carried forward and the benefits that it could provide to modern Inuit should be carefully understood. They also suggested that &quot;angakkuuniq&quot; could be of benefit in dealing with contemporary Inuit social problems such as suicide.

<doc id="1005312" wikidata="Q35329" url="?curid=1005312" title="Elymian language">
<text>Elymian is the extinct language of the ancient Elymian people of western Sicily. Its characteristics are little known because of the extremely limited and fragmentary nature of the surviving texts.

The origins of Elymian and its exact relationships with other languages are unclear due to scarcity of data. It is generally assumed to have been an Indo-European language, but its classification within the Indo-European family is disputed. It has been speculated that Elymian was related to either the Italic languages or the Anatolian languages (such as Hittite), although both theories are disputed - with the first as preferred by the scholars.

An Early Iron Age idiom, Elymian seems to have been spoken until the 3rd century BC.

== Characteristics ==
Only a handful of Elymian texts have survived, dating from between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. These comprise a few proper names recorded by non-Elymian sources; inscriptions in the Greek alphabet on several coins, which include the names of Elymian cities; and inscriptions in the Greek alphabet on about 170 fragments of pottery (found mostly in a votive deposit at the ruined Elymian city of Segesta). These texts have been identified as Elymian, based on their evidently non-Hellenic characteristics, location and age.

The majority of textual artefacts are very short and fragmentary, comprising only a few letters. A small number of longer texts apparently contain a personal name and may have been dedicatory epigraphs. They sometimes appear to resemble Hellenic dedicatory epigraphs, in which an anthroponym in genitive form is followed by a verb literally meaning &quot;I am&quot; in order to convey &quot;belonging&quot;.

A vase found at Montedoro, around 15 km southwest of Palermo, features one of the few complete inscriptions in Elymian. It has been tentatively translated to read &quot;I [the pot] am [a gift] of Ata Tuka&quot;, or &quot;I am [a gift] of Ata of [= son of] Tuka&quot;.

== Classification ==
The inclusion of Elymian within the Indo-European language family is generally accepted, but its further affiliation to the established branches of Indo-European is still disputed. Proposed classifications of the Elymian language can be summarized under two main positions. 

Some historical linguists agreed that some peculiarities of that language – like non-alphabetic symbols engraved on some dedicatory fragments of pots, and genitive in -&quot;ai&quot; found in almost all the complete sequences – are suggestive of a connection to the Anatolian languages, and in particular, to Hittite. Other historical linguists classified Elymian as related to the Italic languages on the basis of other possible features.

Subsequently, the latter thesis found success among the scholars, whose broad consensus recognizes Elymian as an Italic idiom for northwestern Sicily (albeit without the support of overwhelming evidence), although a different italicity from Siculian, spoken further east; instead the Anatolian thesis is no longer carried on, except for a minority. 

However, any resolution of the question of affiliation appears to rely on further archaeological investigations at Elymian settlements in western Sicily.

<text>Hypsilophodon (; meaning &quot;high-crested tooth&quot;) is a neornithischian dinosaur genus from the Early Cretaceous period of England. It has traditionally been considered an early member of the group Ornithopoda, but recent research has put this into question.

The first remains of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; were found in 1849; the type species, &quot;Hypsilophodon foxii&quot;, was named in 1869. Abundant fossil discoveries were made on the Isle of Wight, giving a good impression of the build of the species. It was a small, agile bipedal animal with an herbivorous or possibly omnivorous diet, measuring long and weighing . It had a pointed head equipped with a sharp beak used to bite off plant material, much like modern-day parrots.

Some outdated studies have given rise to a number of misconceptions about &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, including that it was an armoured, arboreal animal, and that it could be found in areas outside of the Isle of Wight. However, research from the following years has shown these ideas to be incorrect.

==Discovery and history==
===First specimens and the debate of distinctiveness===

The first specimen of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was recovered in 1849, when workers dug up the soon-called Mantell-Bowerbank block from an outcrop of the Wessex Formation, part of the Wealden Group, about one hundred yards west of Cowleaze Chine, on the south-west coast of Isle of Wight. The larger half of the block (including seventeen vertebrae, parts of ribs and a coracoid, some of the pelvis, and assorted hindleg remains) was given to naturalist James Scott Bowerbank, and the remainder (including eleven caudal vertebrae and most of the rest of hindlegs) to Gideon Mantell. After his death, Mantell&#x27;s portion was acquired by the British Museum; Bowerbank&#x27;s was acquired later, bringing both halves back together. Richard Owen studied both halves and, in 1855, published a short article on the specimen, considering it to be a young &quot;Iguanodon&quot; rather than a new taxon. This was unquestioned until 1867, when Thomas Henry Huxley compared the vertebrae and metatarsals of the specimen more closely to those of known &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, and concluded that it must be a different animal entirely. The next year, he saw a fossil skull discovered by William Fox on exhibition at the Norwich Meeting of the British Associations. Fox, who had also found his fossil in the Cowleaze Chine area, along with several other specimens, considered it to belong to a juvenile &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, or to represent a new, small species in the genus. Huxley noticed its unique dentition and edentulous premaxilla, reminiscent of but obviously distinct from that of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He concluded this specimen, too, represented a distinct animal from &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. After losing track of the specimen for some months, Huxley requested Fox grant him permission to study the specimen to a more extensive degree. The request was granted, and Huxley began work on his new species.

Huxley first announced the new species in 1869 in a lecture; the text of this, published the same year, forms the official naming article, because it contained a sufficient description. The species was named &quot;Hypsilophodon foxii&quot;, and the holotype was the Fox skull (which today has the inventory number NHM NHMUK PV R 197). The next year, Huxley published the expanded full description article. Within the same block of stone as the Fox skull, the centrum of a dorsal vertebra had been preserved. This allowed comparison with the Mantell-Bowerbank block, confirming it to belong to the same species. Further supporting this, Fox had confirmed that the block was found in the same geological bed as his material. As such, Huxley described this specimen in addition to the skull and centrum. It would become the paratype; its two pieces are now registered in the Natural History Museum as specimen NHMUK PV OR 28707, NHMUK PV OR 39560–1. Later in the same year, Huxley classified &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; taxonomically, considering it to belong to the family Iguanodontidae, related to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;. There would later be a persistent misunderstanding as to the meaning of the generic name, which is often translated directly from the Greek as &quot;high-ridged tooth&quot;. In reality Huxley, analogous to the way the name of the related genus &quot;Iguanodon&quot; (&quot;iguana-tooth&quot;) had been formed, intended to name the animal after an extant herbivorous lizard, choosing for this role &quot;Hypsilophus&quot; and combining its name with Greek ὀδών, &quot;odon&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;. &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; thus means &quot;&quot;Hypsilophus&quot;-tooth&quot;. The Greek ὑψίλοφος, &quot;hypsilophos&quot;, means &quot;high-crested&quot; and refers to the back frill of the lizard, not to the teeth of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; itself, which are not high-ridged in any case. The specific name &quot;foxii&quot; honours Fox.

Immediate reception to Huxley&#x27;s proposal of a new genus, distinct from &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, was mixed. The issue of distinctiveness was seen as important as more information on the form of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was in demand, and the cranial anatomy in particular was of importance. If the Cowleaze Chine material was a distinct genus, it ceased being useful in this respect. Whilst some palaeontologists such as William Boyd Dawkins and Harry Seeley supported distinction, Fox rejected Huxley&#x27;s proposal of a distinct genus and subsequently took back his skull and gave it to Owen to study. In attempt to clarify the situation, John Whitaker Hulke returned to the &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; fossil bed on the Isle of Wight to obtain more material. He remarked that the whole of the skeleton seemed to be present, but that fragility limited excavation. He published a description of his new specimens in 1873, and based on his examination of the new teeth fossils echoed Fox&#x27;s sentiments of doubt. Owen followed this with a study comparising at length the teeth of known &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and those from Fox&#x27;s specimens. He agreed there were differences, but found them lacking in sufficient distinctiveness to be considered a distinct genus. As such, he renamed the species &quot;Iguanodon foxii&quot;. But Hulke had by then shifted his opinion, having obtained two new more informative specimens. Building on Huxley&#x27;s comments on the Mantell-Bowerbank block, he gave focus to vertebral characters. As a result of his study, he concluded &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was a distinct genus related to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He published these findings in a supplementary note, also in 1874. Finally, in 1882 he published a full osteology of the species, considering it of great importance to properly document the taxon as such a wealth of specimens had been discovered and comparison with American dinosaurs was necessary. Fox had by this point died, and no further argument against generic distinctiveness had occurred in the intervening time.

===Later research===
Later, the number of specimens was increased by Reginald Walter Hooley. In 1905, Baron Franz Nopcsa dedicated a study to &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, and in 1936 William Elgin Swinton did the same, on the occasion of the mounting of two restored skeletons in the British Museum of Natural History. Most known &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; specimens were discovered between 1849 and 1921 and are in the possession of the Natural History Museum that acquired the collections of Mantell, Fox, Hulke and Hooley. These represent about twenty individual animals. Apart from the holotype and paratype, the most significant specimens are: NHM R5829, the skeleton of a large animal; NHMUK PV R 5830 and NHMUK PV R 196/196a, both skeletons of juvenile animals; and NHMUK PV R R2477, a block with a skull together with two separate vertebral columns. Although this was the largest find, new ones continue to be made.

Modern research of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; began with the studies of Peter Malcolm Galton, starting with his thesis of 1967. He and James Jensen briefly described a left femur, AMNH 2585, in 1975, and in 1979 formally coined a second species, &quot;Hypsilophodon wielandi&quot;, for the specimen. The femur was diagnosed with two supposed minor differences from that of &quot;H. foxii&quot;. The specimen was found in 1900 in the Black Hills of South Dakota, United States, by George Reber Wieland, who the species was named after. Geologically, it comes from the Lakota Sandstone. This species was seen at the time as indicative of a probable late land bridge between North America and Europe, and of the dinosaur fauna of both continents being similar. Spanish Palaeontologist José Ignacio Ruiz-Omeñaca proposed that &quot;H. wielandi&quot; was not a species of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; but instead related to or synonymous with &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; &quot;valdensis&quot; from England, both species being dryosaurids. Galton refuted this in his contribution to a 2012 book, noting the femurs of the two species to be quite different, and that of &quot;H. wielandi&quot; to be unlike those of dryosaurs. He, as well as other studies before and after Ruiz-Omeñaca&#x27;s proposal, considered &quot;H. wielandi&quot; a dubious basal ornithopod, with &quot;H. foxii&quot; the only species in the genus. Galton elaborated on the invalidity of the species in 2009, noting that the two supposed diagnostic characters were variable in both &quot;H. foxii&quot; and &quot;Orodromeus makelai&quot;, making the species dubious. He speculated that it may belong to &quot;Zephyrosaurus&quot;, from a similar time and place, as no femur was known from that taxon.

Fossils from other locations, especially from the mainland of southern Great Britain, Portugal and Spain, have once been referred to &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;. However, in 2009 Galton concluded that the specimens from Great Britain proper were either indeterminable or belonged to &quot;Valdosaurus&quot;, and that the fossils from the rest of Europe were those of related but different species. This leaves the finds on Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, as the only known authentic &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; fossils. The fossils have been found in the &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; Bed, a one-metre thick marl layer surfacing in a 1200 metre long strip along the Cowleaze Chine parallel to the southwest coast of Wight, part of the upper Wessex Formation and dating to the late Barremian, about 126 million years old. Reports that &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; would be present in the later Vectis Formation, Galton in 2009 considered as unsubstantiated.

==Description==

&quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was a relatively small dinosaur, though not quite as small as, for example, &quot;Compsognathus&quot;. For &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; often a maximum length of is stated. This has its origin in a study of 1974 by Galton, in which he extrapolated a length of based on specimen BMNH R 167, a thigh bone. However, in 2009, Galton concluded that this femur in fact belonged to &quot;Valdosaurus&quot; and downsized &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; to a maximum known length of , the largest specimen being NHMUK PV R 5829 with a femur length of 202 millimetres. Typical specimens are about long. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated a weight of for an animal in length.

Like most small dinosaurs, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was bipedal: it ran on two legs. Its entire body was built for running. Numerous anatomical features aided this, such as: light-weight, minimized skeleton, low, aerodynamic posture, long legs, and stiff tail — immobilized by ossified tendons for balance. In light of this, Galton in 1974 concluded it would have been among the ornithischians best adapted to running. Despite living in the last of the periods in which non-avian dinosaurs walked the earth, the Cretaceous, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; had a number of seemingly &quot;primitive&quot; features. For example, there were five digits on each hand and four on each foot. With &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; the fifth finger had gained a specialised function: being opposable it could serve to grasp food items.

===Cranial anatomy===

In an example of primitive anatomy, although it had a beak like most ornithischians, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; still had five pointed triangular teeth in the front of the upper jaw, the premaxilla. Most herbivorous dinosaurs had, by the Early Cretaceous, become sufficiently specialized that the front teeth had been altogether lost (although there is some debate as to whether these teeth may have had a specialized function in &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;). More to the back, the upper jaw carried up to eleven teeth in the maxilla; the lower jaw had up to sixteen teeth. The number was variable, depending on the size of the animal. The teeth to the back were fan-shaped.

The skull of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was short and relatively large. The snout was triangular in outline and sharply pointed, ending in an upper beak of which the cutting edge was markedly lower than the maxillary tooth row. The eye socket was very large. A palpebral with a length equal to half the diameter of the eye socket overshadowed its top section. A sclerotic ring of fifteen small bone plates supported the outer eye surface. The back of the skull was rather high, with a very large and high jugal and quadratojugal closing off a highly positioned small infratemporal fenestra.

===Postcranial anatomy===
The vertebral column consisted of nine cervical vertebrae, fifteen or sixteen dorsal vertebrae, six of five sacral vertebrae and about forty-eight vertebrae of the tail. Much of the back and the tail was stiffened by long ossified tendons connecting the spines on top of the vertebrae. The processes on the underside of the tail vertebrae, the chevrons, were also connected by ossified tendons, which however were of a different form: they were shorter and split and frayed at one end, with the point of the sharp other end laying within the diverging end of the subsequent tendon. Furthermore, there were several counterdirectional rows of these, resulting in a herring-bone pattern completely immobilising the tail end.

A long-lived misconception concerning the anatomy of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; has been that it was armoured. This was first suggested by Hulke in 1874, after the find of a bone plate in the neck region. If so, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; would have been the only known armoured ornithopod. As Galton pointed out in 2008, the putative armour instead appears to be from the torso, an example of internal intercostal plates associated with the rib cage. It consists of thin mineralized circular plates growing from the back end of the middle rib shaft and overlapping the front edge of the subsequent rib. Such plates are better known from &quot;Talenkauen&quot; and &quot;Thescelosaurus&quot;, and were probably cartilaginous in origin.

==Phylogeny==
Huxley originally assigned &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; to the Iguanodontidae. In 1882 Louis Dollo named a separate Hypsilophodontidae. By the middle of the twentieth century that had become the accepted classification but in the early twenty-first century it became clear through cladistic analysis that hypsilophodontids formed an unnatural, paraphyletic group of successive off-shoots from throughout Neornithischia. &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; in the modern view thus simply is a basal ornithopod. 

In 2014, Norman resolved a monophyletic Hypsilophodontia (avoiding the name &quot;Hypsilophodontidae&quot; due to its complicated history). &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was recovered as the sister taxon to the clade containing &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; and Rhabdodontidae.

In 2017, Daniel Madzia, Clint Boyd, and Martin Mazuch reassessed &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; outside of Ornithopoda altogether, placing it in a more basal position, as the sister taxon to the Cerapoda; several other &quot;hypsilophodontids&quot; have undergone similar reclassifications. The following cladogram is reproduced from this study:

In one analysis in her 2022 review of iguanodontian phylogenetic relationships, Karen E. Poole recovered a large Hypsilophodontidae as the sister taxon of Iguanodontia, which consisted of several &quot;traditional&quot; hypsilophodontids, as well as Thescelosauridae. The Bayesian topology of her phylogenetic analyses is shown in the cladogram below:

In 2023, Longrich &quot;et al.&quot; described &quot;Vectidromeus&quot; as a new coeval genus of ornithopod closely related to &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;. They suggested that &quot;Vectidromeus&quot; and &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; represented the only members of the Hypsilophodontidae, since other taxa previously assigned to the group had subsequently been moved to other clades.

==Paleobiology==

Due to its small size, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; fed on low-growing vegetation, in view of the pointed snout most likely preferring high quality plant material, such as young shoots and roots, in the manner of modern deer. The structure of its skull, with the teeth set far back into the jaw, strongly suggests that it had cheeks, an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food. There were twenty-three to twenty-seven maxillary and dentary teeth with vertical ridges in the animal&#x27;s upper and lower jaws which, due to the fact that the tooth row of the lower jaw, its teeth curving outwards, fitted within that of the upper jaw, with its teeth curving inwards, appear to have been self-sharpening, the occlusion wearing down the teeth and providing for a simple chewing mechanism. As in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the ornithischians, the teeth were continuously replaced in an alternate arrangement, with the two replacement waves moving from the back to the front of the jaw. The Zahnreihen-spacing, the average distance in tooth position between teeth of the same eruption stage, was rather low with &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, about 2,3. Such a dentition would have allowed to process relatively tough plants.

Early paleontologists modelled the body of this small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur in various ways. In 1882 Hulke suggested that &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was quadrupedal but also, in view of its grasping hand, able to climb rocks and trees in order to seek shelter. In 1912 this line of thought was further pursued by Austrian paleontologist Othenio Abel. Concluding that the first toe of the foot could function as an opposable hallux, Abel stated that &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was a fully arboreal animal and even that an arboreal lifestyle was primitive for the dinosaurs as a whole. Though this hypothesis was doubted by Nopcsa, it was adopted by the Danish researcher Gerhard Heilmann who in 1916 proposed that a quadrupedal &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; lived like the modern tree-kangaroo &quot;Dendrolagus&quot;. In 1926 Heilmann had again changed his mind, denying that the first toe was opposable because the first metatarsal was firmly connected to the second, but in 1927 Abel refused to accept this. In this he was in 1936 supported by Swinton who claimed that even a forward pointing first metatarsal might carry a movable toe. As Swinton was a very influential populariser of dinosaurs, this remained the accepted view for over three decades, most books typically illustrating &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; sitting on a tree branch. However, Peter M. Galton in 1969 performed a more accurate analysis of the musculo-skeletal structure, showing that the body posture was horizontal. In 1971 Galton in detail refuted Abel&#x27;s arguments, showing that the first toe had been incorrectly reconstructed and that neither the curvature of the claws, nor the level of mobility of the shoulder girdle or the tail could be seen as adaptations for climbing, concluding that &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; was a bipedal running form. This convinced the paleontological community that &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; remained firmly on the ground.

The level of parental care in this dinosaur has not been defined, nests not having been found, although neatly arranged nests are known from related species, suggesting that some care was taken before hatching. The &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; fossils were probably accumulated in a single mass mortality event, so it has been considered likely that the animals moved in large groups. For these reasons, the hypsilophodonts, particularly &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, have often been referred to as the &quot;deer of the Mesozoic&quot;. Some indications about the reproductive habits are provided by the possibility of sexual dimorphism: Galton considered it likely that exemplars with five instead of six sacral vertebrae — with some specimens the vertebra that should normally count as the first of the sacrum has a rib not touching the pelvis — represented female individuals.

<doc id="1005316" wikidata="Q14419" url="?curid=1005316" title="Camarasaurus">
<text>Camarasaurus ( ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period. Its fossil remains have been found in the Morrison Formation, dating to the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian ages of the Jurassic, between 155 and 145 million years ago (mya).

&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; presented a distinctive cranial profile of a blunt snout and an arched skull that was remarkably square, typical of basal macronarians.

The generic name means &quot;chambered lizard&quot;, referring to the hollow chambers, known as pleurocoels, in its cervical vertebrae (Greek (&#x27;) meaning &quot;vaulted chamber&quot;, or anything with an arched cover, and (&#x27;) meaning &quot;lizard&quot;).

&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; contains four species that are commonly recognized as valid: &quot;Camarasaurus grandis&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus lentus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus lewisi&quot;, and &quot;Camarasaurus supremus&quot;. &quot;C. supremus&quot;, the type species, is the largest and geologically youngest of the four. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is the type genus of Camarasauridae, which also includes its European close relative &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot;.

&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was named in 1877 by Edward Drinker Cope, during the period of scientific rivalry between him and Othniel Charles Marsh known as the Bone Wars. Soon after, Marsh named a genus &quot;Morosaurus&quot;, but it was subsequently shown to be synonymous with &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;.

==History==

=== Initial discovery ===
The first record of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; comes from the spring of 1877 when Mr. Oramel William Lucas of Cañon City, Colorado discovered some large vertebrae at Garden Park, which he sent to Edward Drinker Cope who was based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The original material sent consisted of a partial cervical vertebra, which would become the taxon&#x27;s namesake, three dorsal vertebrae, and four caudal vertebrae. This specimen is now thought to have been composed of several individuals. From these initial fragmentary remains, Cope made his original description of &quot;Camarasaurus supremus&quot; (“supreme chambered lizard”) and founded the genus; these remains are now in the American Museum of Natural History under the catalogue number AMNH 560. After receiving the original bones, Cope employed collectors who gathered more of the material which was described in 1921 by Henry Osborn and Charles Mook.

The amount of material was great, it composed of several jumbled partial skeletons. It was not all prepared at once, but a considerable amount of it was cleaned up by Jacob Geismar under Cope&#x27;s direction throughout the 1870s to 1890s. In 1877 a reconstruction of the skeleton of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was painted by Dr. John Ryder on several canvasses, under the direction of Professor Cope who would use them in lectures to impress his audience. This reconstruction would be the first ever made of a sauropod dinosaur, was natural size and represented the remains of a number of individuals. The reconstruction was over fifty feet in length. Cope&#x27;s collectors sent in more material from 1877 to 1878, and as Cope would get more material, he would name taxa based on these newly sent remains. Most of these additional taxa are now considered dubious or synonymous with &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. By the end of collecting in Garden Park, at least four individuals and several hundred bones had been found from nearly every part of the skeleton.

=== Como Bluff finds and &quot;Morosaurus&quot; ===

The next &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; discovery came later in 1877, when a fragmentary posterior skull and a partial postcranial skeleton was discovered and collected in Quarry 1, Como Bluff, Wyoming by crews working for Othniel Charles Marsh. This skeleton would be the best preserved single individual of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; at the time, and it was named as a new species of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in 1877. The specimen was not fully collected until 1879 and the specimen contains the majority of a juvenile&#x27;s skeleton (holotype YPM 1901) Meanwhile, crews working for Edward Cope in Garden Park, collected a fragmentary specimen consisting of a femur and 2 caudal vertebrae was made a new species of &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; by Cope which he named &quot;Amphicoelias latus&quot; in 1877. This species was tentatively synonymized with &quot;C. supremus&quot; in 1921. In 1998, Kenneth Carpenter argued that the stratigraphic position of the find suggested it was more likely to be synonymous with &quot;C. grandis&quot;, but in a 2005 study of the biostratigraphic distribution of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, Takehito Ikejiri retained it in synonymy with &quot;C. supremus&quot;. In 1878, a sauropod sacrum was discovered with several other jumbled sauropod postcranial elements, again at Como Bluff. The remains were also sent to Marsh and in 1878 the sacrum was assigned to a new genus and species, &quot;Morosaurus impar&quot; (&quot;unpaired stupid lizard&quot;). &quot;Morosaurus&quot; would receive several new species throughout the late 19th century, even becoming part of a new family in 1892, the Morosauridae. A majority of &quot;Morosaurus&quot; species are now considered dubious, including the type species, or reclassified. In 1889, a new species of &quot;Morosaurus&quot; was named based on a partial skull and skeleton from Como Bluff. &quot;Morosaurus lentus&quot; was the name given to the skeleton (holotype YPM 1910) and the skeleton was mounted in the Yale Peabody Museum fossil hall in 1930.

=== Second Dinosaur Rush finds ===

In the late 1890s, the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum found additional &quot;Morosaurus&quot; material at Como Bluff and Fruita respectively. Mostly consisting of limb material, the new &quot;Morosaurus&quot; material led to new reconstructions of sauropod manus and pes structure. The AMNH made an important discovery in 1899 at their Bone Cabin Quarry in Wyoming with the discovery of the first complete &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skull and mandible with associated cervical vertebrae. Major reassessment of &quot;Morosaurus&quot; and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; came in 1901, a reassessment by Elmer Riggs concluded that of the five &quot;Morosaurus&quot; species named by Marsh, only three were valid. &quot;Morosaurus grandis&quot;, &quot;Morosaurus lentus&quot;, and &quot;Morosaurus agilis&quot; (now known as &quot;Smitanosaurus&quot;) were accepted as valid, with &quot;Morosaurus impar&quot; synonymous with &quot;M. grandis&quot;. Possible synonymy between &quot;Morosaurus&quot; and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was also suggested by Riggs. In 1905, the first mounted skeleton of a sauropod was mounted at the AMNH of a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, the skull of the mount was notoriously based on material that was likely from a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; from Como Bluff.

The Carnegie Museum had an important &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; discovery in 1909 of a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile, now under specimen number CM 11338. The specimen was notably found articulated in a death pose and is prominently displayed at the Carnegie Museum hall. Earl Douglass discovered the specimen and it was collected from 1909 to 1910 by Carnegie Museum crew working at Dinosaur National Monument. This skeleton was not described until 1925 by Charles W. Gilmore This specimen was referred to &quot;Camarasaurus lentus&quot;. The skeleton is one of the best sauropod specimens known, with almost every element preserved in articulation including the fragile cervical vertebrae.

Another &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skeleton was found in 1918, again at Dinosaur National Monument by Carnegie crews, this specimen can be viewed at the National Museum of Natural History. The specimen, known as USNM V 13786, was traded to the USNM in 1935 and prep work started on the specimen in 1936 at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas where it could be viewed by visitors of the event. Preparation work would continue until 1947 when the skeleton was mounted in a death pose in the fossil hall. The USNM&#x27;s &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was also referred to &quot;C. lentus&quot;.

In 1919, W. J. Holland would name &quot;Uintasaurus douglassi&quot; based another sauropod specimen from DNM that was discovered by the Carnegie Museum in 1909. The type specimen was incomplete, consisting of 5 anterior cervical vertebrae, and is a synonym of &quot;Camarasaurus lentus&quot;. Additional &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; material was found at near Black Mesa in western Oklahoma during the 1940s and has been referred to &quot;Camarasaurus supremus&quot;&quot;,&quot; the material consists of many large vertebrae and some skull elements.

=== Resurgent discoveries ===

No major discoveries would come for &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; until in 1967, James Jensen collected a well preserved and articulated partial postcranial skeleton, including majority of the vertebral column, at Uncompahgre Hill in western Colorado and was deposited at Brigham Young University under specimen number BYU 9740. The skeleton wasn&#x27;t full prepared until years later, and was described in 1988 as a new genus and species of Camarasaurid, &quot;Cathetosaurus lewisi&quot;. &quot;C. lewisi&quot;″s original description was brief, but later in 1996 the skeleton was given a full osteology and placed as a species of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; by John McIntosh and colleagues. In their paper, they determined that &quot;C. supremus, C. grandis, C. lentus,&quot; and &quot;C. lewisi&quot; were valid. In 2013, Octavio Mateus and Emanuel Tschopp argued that &quot;C. lewisi&quot; was actually its own genus based on a specimen found at Howe Quarry in 1992 that they referred to the species. Further research by Tschopp concluded that the Howe Quarry specimen was most likely to represent &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; after all. As of 2019, most researchers considered &quot;C. lewisi&quot; to be a species of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;.

In 1992, another substantial and articulated skeleton of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was collected, this skeleton by Jeffrie Parker and colleagues near the AMNH&#x27;s Bone Cabin Quarry at Como Bluff. This skeleton was referred to &quot;Camarasaurus grandis&quot; and is one of the most complete specimens assigned to the species, it now resides at the Gunma Museum of Natural History in Tokyo under specimen number GMNH-PV 101. 1992 saw yet another &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skeleton discovery further north at Howe Quarry, Wyoming by crews working for the Sauriermuseum Aathal in Switzerland. The skeleton is one of the best known, with nearly every element articulated and skin impressions from the skull and hindlimb. The specimen, SMA 002, has not yet gotten a full identification, but has been suggested to be a specimen of &quot;C. lewisi&quot;. In 1996, several fragmentary remains of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; were described from western South Dakota and New Mexico, extending the northeastern and southern range of the genus, with the New Mexican remains from the Summerville Formation. The northernmost specimen of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was discovered in 2005 in the Snowy Mountains region of central Montana and consists of a nearly complete skull and several postcranial elements.

==Fossil record==

&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; fossils are very common. Over 500 specimens are known, including many isolated bones and about 50 partial skeletons. It is found in a wide area over the western United States, from as far north as Montana to as far south as New Mexico, in rocks of the Morrison Formation. Due to this abundance, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is a very well-known sauropod. A juvenile specimen of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, CM 11338, is the most complete sauropod skeleton ever discovered. Numerous skulls are known. Even though complete necks are rarely found in sauropods, five specimens of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; preserve all or nearly all of the cervical vertebrae. Most identifiable specimens of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; belong to one of two species, &quot;C. grandis&quot; and &quot;C. lentus&quot;; &quot;C. lewisi&quot; and &quot;C. supremus&quot; are rarer.

== Description ==
&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is among the most common and frequently well-preserved sauropod dinosaurs uncovered and has been well described in numerous publications. Similar to other Macronarians, it had the typical large naris, long forelimbs, and short tail compared to the contemporary Diplodocids. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was a medium-sized sauropod compared to contemporary species in the same formation, but in the Tithonian reached large sizes with &quot;C. supremus&quot;. The maximum size of the most common species, &quot;C. lentus&quot;, was about 15 m (49 ft) in length. The largest species, &quot;C. supremus&quot;, reached a maximum length of 18 meters (59 ft) - 23 m (75 ft) and, a maximum estimated weight of 47 metric tons (51.8 tons). In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated its weight at 23 metric tons (25.4 tons), whereas in 2020, John Foster estimated its weight at 42.3 metric tons (46.6 tons).

The arched skull of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was remarkably square and the blunt snout had many fenestrae. The robust skull of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; preserves much better than many other sauropods, unlike the gracile skulls that Diplodocids that are also found in the Morrison Formation. The 19-cm-long (7.5-in) teeth were shaped like chisels (spatulate) and arranged evenly along the jaw. The strength of the teeth indicates that &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; probably ate coarser plant material than the slender-toothed diplodocids.

A specimen of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; called SMA 0002 (which has also been assigned to &quot;Cathetosaurus&quot;) from Wyoming&#x27;s Howe-Stephens Quarry, referred to as &quot;E.T.&quot;, shows evidence of soft tissue. Along the jaw line, ossified remains of what appear to have been the animal&#x27;s gums have been recovered, indicating that it had deep-set teeth covered by gums, with only the tips of the crowns protruding. The teeth were, upon death, pushed further out from their sockets as the gums retracted, dried, and tightened through decay. The examinations of the specimen also indicate that the teeth were covered by tough outer scales and possibly a beak of some variety, though this is not known for certain.

The neck of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was of only moderate length by sauropod standards. It was composed of 12 vertebrae. Most of the cervical neural spines were bifurcated, with more vertebrae developing bifurcated neural spines as the animal grew. As in other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck and torso contained chambers that in life were filled by air sacs connected to the respiratory system. The air sacs could take up more than half of the space inside the vertebrae, making them as highly pneumatic as the bones of birds. It is these chambers that give &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; its name, &quot;chambered lizard&quot;.

The tail of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; was composed of 53 vertebrae.

==Classification and species==
&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is the type genus of the family Camarasauridae, members of which are medium-sized Macronarian sauropods that mostly date to the Late Jurassic. Camarasaurids had shorter forelimbs than hindlimbs, large scapulocoracoids, and longer tails than necks. When Edward Cope described &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; in 1877, he believed it was a dinosaur closely related to &quot;Cetiosaurus, Bothriospondylus, Ornithopsis, Anchisaurus&quot; (&quot;Megadactylus&quot;), and &quot;Pneumatosteus&quot;, but didn’t name a group for these taxa until the description of &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; when he erected Camarasauridae. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is the only taxon uncontroversially regarded as a valid genus of camarasaurid. It contains four species: &quot;C. grandis&quot;, &quot;C. lentus&quot;, &quot;C. lewisi&quot;, and &quot;C. supremus&quot;. &quot;C. lewisi&quot; may represent a distinct genus, &quot;Cathetosaurus&quot;. &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot;, the type species of which was formerly assigned to &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, is regarded as a camarasaurid by most studies, though it has also been considered to be a basal eusauropod.

A simplified cladogram of basal Macronaria after Tan et al (2020) is shown below:
&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is considered to be a basal macronarian, more closely related to the common ancestor of all macronarians than to more derived forms like &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;.

=== Species ===
&quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is regarded as containing four valid species by most researchers: &quot;C. grandis&quot;, &quot;C. lentus&quot;, &quot;C. lewisi&quot;, and &quot;C. supremus&quot;. &quot;C. supremus&quot;, the species named by Cope in 1877, is the type species. &quot;C. grandis&quot; was named in 1877 and &quot;C. lentus&quot; in 1889. The fourth species, &quot;C. lewisi&quot;, is of uncertain affinities. It was originally described as a distinct genus, &quot;Cathetosaurus&quot;, in 1988, but reclassified as a species of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; in 1996. Some researchers have suggested that &quot;Cathetosaurus&quot; should be reinstated as a distinct genus, whereas others have suggested that &quot;C. lewisi&quot; may be synonymous with another &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; species.

&quot;C. supremus&quot;, as its name suggests, is the largest known species of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and one of the most massive sauropods known from the late Jurassic Morrison Formation. Except for its huge size, it was nearly indistinguishable from &quot;C. lentus&quot;. &quot;C. supremus&quot; was not typical of the genus as a whole, and is known only from the latest, uppermost parts of the formation and is extremely uncommon. Both &quot;C. grandis,&quot; &quot;C. lentus,&quot; and &quot;C. lewisi&quot; were smaller, as well as occurring in the earlier stages of the Morrison.
Stratigraphic evidence suggests that chronological sequence aligned with the physical differences between the three species, and it describes an evolutionary progression within the Morrison Formation. &quot;C. grandis&quot; is the oldest species and occurred in the lowest rock layers of the Morrison. &quot;C. lewisi&quot; only briefly coexisted with &quot;C. grandis&quot; in the lowest strata of the upper Morrison until going extinct, but it is possible this is because of a lack of specimens from &quot;C. lewisi&quot;. &quot;C. lentus&quot; appeared later, co-existing with &quot;C. grandis&quot; for several million years, possibly due to different ecological niches as suggested by differences in the spinal anatomy of the two species. At a later stage, &quot;C. grandis&quot; disappeared from the rock record, leaving only &quot;C. lentus&quot;. Then &quot;C. lentus&quot;, too, disappeared; at the same time, &quot;C. supremus&quot; appeared in the uppermost layers. This immediate succession of species, as well as the very close similarity between the two, suggests that &quot;C. supremus&quot; may have evolved directly from &quot;C. lentus&quot;, representing a larger, later-surviving population of animals.

==== Synonyms and dubious species ====

* &quot;Amphicoelias latus&quot; was named by Edward Cope in 1877 based on a right femur and 4 caudal vertebrae found at Garden Park and is synonymous with either &quot;C. supremus&quot; or &quot;C. grandis&quot;.
* &quot;Caulodon diversidens&quot; was also named by Cope in 1877 on, now dubious, teeth that can only be placed as a Macronarian or as synonymous with &quot;Camarasaurus supremus&quot;.
* &quot;Caulodon leptoganus&quot; was named in 1878 by Cope on 2 partial teeth and is also considered to be unclassifiable beyond Macronaria or as synonymous with &quot;Camarasaurus supremus&quot;.
* &quot;Morosaurus impar&quot; was named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of &quot;Morosaurus&quot;, and the material consisted only of a sacrum and possibly additional postcranial material found at Como Bluff. It is now considered a synonym of &quot;C. grandis.&quot;
* &quot;Morosaurus robustus&quot; was named on the basis of an ilium by Marsh in 1878 collected at Como Bluff. It is now considered a synonym of &quot;C. grandis&quot;.
* &quot;Camarasaurus leptodirus&quot; was another one of Cope&#x27;s Garden Park sauropods and was named in 1879 on 3 partial cervical vertebrae, it has been suggested to be a synonym of &quot;C. supremus&quot;.
*&quot;Diplodocus lacustris&quot; was named by Othniel Marsh in 1884 on the basis of several teeth, a premaxilla, and a maxilla from Morrison, Colorado that were collected by Arthur Lakes and Benjamin Mudge in 1877. Although the teeth and dentary of &quot;D. lacustris&quot; are Flagellicaudatan, the skull material is likely that of a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;.
* &quot;Pleurocoelus montanus&quot; was also named by Marsh in 1896 as a new species of &quot;Pleurocoelus&quot;, the material consisting of several vertebral centra and assorted postcrania of a juvenile individual from Como Bluff. It is generally regarded as a synonym of &quot;C. grandis.&quot;
*&quot;Uintasaurus douglassi&quot; was named in 1919 by W. J. Holland for 5 anterior cervical vertebrae from Dinosaur National Monument, the species was later regarded as a synonym of &quot;Camarasaurus lentus&quot;.
*&quot;Camarasaurus annae&quot; was named by Tage Ellinger based on an anterior dorsal vertebra in 1950. This species is generally considered a synonym of &quot;C.lentus.&quot;

==== Reassigned species ====

* &quot;Morosaurus agilis&quot; was named in 1889 by Marsh based on a partial skull and 3 vertebrae from Garden Park, Colorado. The species remained in taxonomic uncertainty until in 2020, it was placed in a new genus, &quot;Smitanosaurus&quot;, and reclassified as a dicraeosaurid.
* &quot;Camarasaurus becklesiii&quot; was described as &quot;Pelorosaurus becklesii&quot; in 1842 by Gideon Mantell based on a partial forelimb from Sussex, United Kingdom. It was placed in &quot;Morosaurus&quot; by Marsh in 1889 and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; by von Huene in 1932 until in 2015, it was placed in its own genus, &quot;Haestasaurus&quot;.
* &quot;Morosaurus marchei&quot; was named by Sauvage in 1898 based on an incomplete distal caudal vertebra and tooth from the Upper Jurassic strata of the Alcobaca Formation of Portugal. Lapparent &amp; Zbyszewski referred the holotype vertebra to &quot;Megalosaurus insignis&quot; and Madsen &quot;et al&quot;., 1995 referred it to Megalosauria. The referred tooth was identified as belonging to Turiasauria in 2017.
* &quot;Camarasaurus alenquerensis&quot; was named as a species of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski on a partial postcranial skeleton from Lourinha, Portugal. It was placed in &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; by John McIntosh in 1990, but was granted a new genus in 1998, &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot;.

==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===

Previously, scientists have suggested that &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and other sauropods may have swallowed gastroliths (stones) to help grind the food in the stomach, regurgitating or passing them when they became too smooth. More recent analysis, however, of the evidence for stomach stones suggests this was not the case. The strong, robust teeth of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; were more developed than those of most sauropods and were replaced on average every 62 days (M. D&#x27;Emic et al.), indicating that &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; may have masticated food in its mouth to some degree before swallowing. Other findings indicate that &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; spp. preferred vegetation different from other sauropods, allowing them to share the same environment without competing.

===Growth===
Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Griebeler &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded that the &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; sp. CM 36664 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 20 years and died at age 26.

===Metabolism===
Eagle &quot;et al.&quot; performed clumped isotope thermometry on the enamel covering the teeth of various Jurassic sauropods, including &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. Temperatures of were obtained, which is comparable to that of modern mammals. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; grew in size quickly to limit the time it would be vulnerable to predation. This would imply it had a relatively high metabolic rate as a juvenile.

===Paleopathology===

A &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; pelvis recovered from Dinosaur National Monument in Utah shows gouging attributed to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and on the ilium of the &quot;C. lewisi&quot; holotype there are large Theropod bite marks.

In 1992, a partial &quot;C. grandis&quot; skeleton was discovered at the Bryan Small Stegosaurus Quarry of the Morrison Formation near Canon City, Colorado. This specimen preserved a partial right humerus cataloged as DMNH 2908 and associated vertebrae from the back and tail. In 2001, Lorie McWhinney, Kenneth Carpenter, and Bruce Rothschild published a description of a pathology observed on the humerus. They noted a juxtacortical lesion 25 by 18 cm wide made of bone that resembled woven fibers. Although woven bone forms in accessory dental bone, in other locations, it is a sign of injury or illness. The woven bone&#x27;s &quot;undulating fibrous bundles&quot; were observed oriented in the direction of the &quot;m. brachialis&quot;. The lesion&#x27;s and lack of porosity at its near and far ends indicate the periostitis was inactive or healed. McWhinney and the other researchers argued that this injury would have been a continuous source of hardship for the animal. It would have exerted pressure on the muscles. This pressure would have compressed the muscles&#x27; blood vessels and nerves, reducing the range of motion of both the limb&#x27;s flexor and extensor muscles. This effect would have hindered the &quot;M. brachialis&quot;, &quot;m. brachoradialis&quot;, and to a lesser degree the &quot;m. biceps brachii&quot; to the lesion&#x27;s position on the humerus. The researchers inferred that the inflammation of the muscles and periosteum would have caused additional complications in the lower region of the fore limb, as well. The lesion would also have caused long-term fasciitis and myosistis. The cumulative effect of these pathological processes would have moderate to severe effects on the ability of the limb to move and &quot;made everyday activities such as foraging for food and escaping predators harder to accomplish.&quot; To help determine the cause of the pathology, McWhinney and the other researchers performed a CT scan in 3-mm increments. The CT scan found that the mass had a consistent radiodensity and was separated from the cortex of the bone by a radiolucent line. No evidence was found of stress fracture or infectious processes like osteomyelitis or infectious periostitis. They also ruled out osteochondroma because the axis of the spur is 25° relative to the vertical axis of the humerus, whereas an osteochondroma would have formed at 90° to the axis of the humerus. Other candidates identified by the scientists for the origin of the spur-bearing lesion included:

# Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy – although this was ruled out by the presence of the spur-like process
# Osteoid osteoma – but this would not explain the spur or osteoblastic reaction
# Shin splints or tibial stress syndrome – a possible origin, as many symptoms would be held in common, but shin splints would not explain the spur.
# Myositis ossificans traumatica (circumscripta) – Possible, but unlikely source.
# Avulsion injury – McWhinney and the other researchers considered an avulsion injury caused by &quot;repetitive overexertion of the muscles&quot; to be the most likely source for the lesion on the humerus. The researchers believed the lesion to have originated with the avulsion of the &quot;m. brachialis&quot; causing the formation of &quot;a downward-sloping elliptical mass&quot;. The bone spur was caused by an osteoblastic response following a tear at the base of the &quot;m. brachioradialis&quot; caused by its flexor motion.

==Paleoecology==

===Habitat===

The Morrison Formation, situated along the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, is home to a fossil-rich stretch of Late Jurassic rock. A large number of dinosaur species can be found here, including relatives of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; such as &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, but camarasaurs are the most abundant of the dinosaurs in the formation. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; fossils have been found in almost every major locality and have one of the greatest known distributions of Morrison dinosaurs, with fossils found in localities from New Mexico to Montana and Utah to Oklahoma. According to radiometric dating, the Morrison sedimentary layers range between 156.3 million years ago (Mya) at the base, to 146.8 Mya at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. Its environment is interpreted as semiarid with distinct wet and dry seasons.

Dinosaur and trace fossils are found particularly in the Morrison Basin, which stretches from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. Eroded material from their east-facing drainage basins was carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. The formation is similar in age to the Lourinha Formation in Portugal and the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation in Argentina, Camarasaurid fossils have been found at the 2 formations. In 1877, it became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, with &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; itself being discovered and named by the latter Paleontologist during the conflict.

===Paleofauna===
The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot;, &quot;Amphicoelias, Barosaurus,&quot; &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. Dinosaurs living alongside &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; included the herbivorous ornithischians &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gargoyleosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Nanosaurus&quot;. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods &quot;Saurophaganax&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Marshosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, and &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, which accounted for up to 75% of theropod specimens, and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; is commonly found at the same sites as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Diplodocus&quot;.

Other organisms in this region included bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs, and several species of pterosaurs such as &quot;Harpactognathus&quot; and &quot;Mesadactylus&quot;. Early mammals present were docodonts (such as &quot;Docodon&quot;), multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the &quot;Araucaria&quot;-like conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot;.

<text>The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship (E. L. F.) is a &quot;Special Interest Group&quot; of the Mythopoeic Society devoted to the study of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages, headed by the computer scientist Carl F. Hostetter. It was founded by Jorge Quiñónez in 1988.

== Organising Tolkien&#x27;s language writings ==

In 1992, Christopher Tolkien appointed the editors of the E.L.F. to order, edit, and then publish his father&#x27;s writings concerning his constructed languages. They have worked from photocopies of the materials sent to them and from notes taken by the group&#x27;s members in the Bodleian and Marquette University Tolkien manuscript archives. This main course of publication is being carried out intermittently in the journal &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot;. There are, however, some writings that are largely independent, and/or whose context has been sufficiently established by Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s own chronological publication efforts in &quot;The History of Middle-earth,&quot; and so do not have to be presented in the normal chronological flow of the larger project. Such materials are being published in the journal &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot;. Members include Christopher Gilson, Carl F. Hostetter, Arden R. Smith, Bill Welden, and Patrick H. Wynne.

== Journals ==


The E. L. F. publishes two journals, Vinyar Tengwar, edited by Hostetter, and Parma Eldalamberon, edited by Christopher Gilson. There is an online journal, &quot;Tengwestië&quot;, edited by Hostetter and Patrick H. Wynne; and it sponsors the &quot;Lambengolmor&quot; (Quenya: &quot;loremasters&quot;) mailing list.

=== &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; ===

&quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; (broken Quenya for &#x27;The Book of Elven-tongues&#x27;) was founded in 1971 as a fanzine devoted to a variety of invented literary languages, initially published under the auspices of the Mythopoeic Society, and then taken over by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.

In 1995, with the support of Christopher Tolkien and permission of the Tolkien Estate, &quot;Parma&quot; was reinvented as a series of standalone volumes publishing in full material from Tolkien&#x27;s manuscripts relating to languages and scripts. Much of this material was previously unpublished or published only in heavily edited form. For example, selections from the &quot;Gnomish Lexicon&quot;, published in full in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; #11, were published in the Appendices to &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;.

=== &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; ===

&quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; (broken Quenya for &quot;News Letters&quot;) is a refereed journal () published by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship, dedicated to the study of the languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien. The publication is indexed by the Modern Language Association. 

&quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; first appeared in 1988, at first edited by Jorge Quiñónez and later taken over by Hostetter. It appeared in bimonthly intervals at first, but after July 1994, issues appeared more irregularly, roughly once a year, until #49 appeared in June 2007; there was then a hiatus until March 2013, when issue #50 appeared. As of 2020, no further issues had been published. The journal was dedicated primarily to the editing of Tolkien&#x27;s linguistic texts, some of which were mentioned in volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, edited by Christopher Tolkien, but not published in that series owing to their specialist nature.

=== &quot;Tengwestië&quot; ===

&quot;Tengwestië&quot; is the E.L.F.&#x27;s online journal. Its editors are Carl F. Hostetter and Patrick H. Wynne. Articles have appeared intermittently.

=== ELFcon ===

The ELFcon was the annual open conference of the E.L.F., held from 1991 to 1994. Its purpose was to present scholarly papers on any subject relating to Tolkien&#x27;s invented languages, to discuss the papers amongst the attendees, and to serve as a friendly gathering for a common intellectual pursuit. ELFcons ended in 1994, but Tolkienist conventions organized by Bill Welden continued, renamed to &quot;Omentielva&quot;, from &quot;omentie&quot;, Quenya for &quot;meeting&quot;. Its proceedings are published in &quot;Arda Philology&quot;.

<doc id="1005365" wikidata="Q2487780" url="?curid=1005365" title="Water caltrop">
<text>The water caltrop is any of three extant species of the genus &quot;Trapa&quot;: Trapa natans, Trapa bicornis and the endangered Trapa rossica. It is also known as buffalo nut, bat nut, devil pod, ling nut, mustache nut, singhara nut or water chestnut.

The species are floating annual aquatic plants, growing in slow-moving freshwater up to deep, native to warm temperate parts of Eurasia and Africa. They bear ornately shaped fruits, which in the case of &quot;T. bicornis&quot; resemble the head of a bull or the silhouette of a flying bat. Each fruit contains a single very large, starchy seed. &quot;T. natans&quot; and &quot;T. bicornis&quot; have been cultivated in China and the Indian subcontinent for the edible seeds for at least 3,000 years.

== Description ==

The water caltrop&#x27;s submerged stem reaches in length, anchored into the mud by very fine roots. It has two types of leaves: finely divided, feather-like submerged leaves borne along the length of the stem, and undivided floating leaves borne in a rosette at the water&#x27;s surface. The floating leaves have saw-tooth edges and are ovoid or triangular in shape, long, on inflated petioles long, which provide added buoyancy for the leafy portion. Four-petalled white flowers form in early summer and are insect-pollinated. The fruit is a nut with four barbed spines. Seeds can remain viable up to 12 years, although most germinate within the first two years.

The plant spreads by the rosettes and fruits detaching from the stem and floating to another area on currents or by fruits clinging to objects, and animals.

The unrelated &quot;Eleocharis dulcis&quot; is also called a water chestnut. It is an aquatic plant, a sedge, whose round, crisp-fleshed corms are common in Chinese food.

=== Chemistry ===

Bicornin is an ellagitannin found in &quot;T. bicornis&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Phylogeny ===

The genus has an extensive fossil record, with numerous, distinctive species. Undisputed fossilized seeds have been found in Cenozoic strata starting from the Eocene throughout Europe, China and North America (though, the genus became extinct in North America prior to the Pleistocene). The oldest known fossils attributed to the genus, however, are of leaves from Cretaceous Alaska, referred to the species, &quot;T. borealis&quot;.

=== Etymology ===

The generic name &quot;Trapa&quot; is derived from the Latin word for &quot;thistle&quot;, , as also is another common name for the water caltrop.

The plant&#x27;s name in Japanese is , a word that is also used to mean &quot;a diamond or lozenge shape, a rhombus&quot;. The manufacturing group Mitsubishi takes its name and logo of three lozenges from the water caltrop.

It is called &#x27; in Sanskrit, which is shortened to &#x27; in Hindi language. In Eastern India, the samosa a fried or baked pastry is also called Shingara because its shape resembles that of the Shingara fruit.

== History ==

Investigations of archaeological material from southern Germany indicate that the prehistoric population of that region may have relied significantly upon wild water caltrops to supplement their normal diet and, in times of cultivated cereal crop failure, water caltrops may have been the main dietary component. Today, water caltrop is so rare in Germany that it is listed as an endangered species.

Water caltrop has been an important food for worship as prayer offerings since the Chinese Zhou dynasty. The Rites of Zhou (second century BC) mentioned that a worshipper &quot;should use a bamboo basket containing dried water caltrops, the seeds of &quot;Euryale ferox&quot; and caltrops&quot; (加籩之實，菱芡栗脯). The &quot;Chinese Herbal Medicine Summary&quot; (本草備要 published in 1694, written by Wang Ang 汪昂) claims that water caltrop can help fever and drunkenness. 

In India and Pakistan, it is known as &quot;singhara&quot; or &quot;paniphal&quot; (eastern India) and is widely cultivated in freshwater lakes. The fruits are eaten raw or boiled. When the fruit has been dried, it is ground to a flour called &quot;singhare ka atta&quot;, used in many religious rituals, and can be consumed as a &quot;phalahar&quot; (fruit diet) on the Hindu fasting days, the navratas.

It was possible to buy water caltrops in markets all over Europe until 1880. In northern Italy, the nuts were offered roasted, much as sweet chestnuts (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;) are still sold today. In many parts of Europe, water caltrops were known and used for human food until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, however, it is a rare plant in Europe. Several reasons for its near extirpation exist, such as climate fluctuations, changes in the nutrient content of water bodies, and the drainage of many wetlands, ponds, and oxbow lakes.

&quot;T. natans&quot; was introduced to the US state of Massachusetts around 1874, as a planting in the Harvard University Botanic Garden. Staff gardener Louis Guerineau took it upon himself to throw seeds into Fresh Pond and other Cambridge waterways. This came to the attention of Medford-based botanist George E. Davenport, who decided to bring seeds and live plants to his friend Minor Pratt, in Concord. He and Pratt seeded a pond near the Sudbury River, and he suspected Pratt of conducting additional distributions. As early as 1879, concern was voiced by botanist Charles Sprague Sargent, director of Boston&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum, that this non-native species threatened to become a nuisance, based on dense growths reported in Cambridge. Davenport confessed in an entry in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Vol. 6, page 352: &quot;I have several times had plants of &quot;Trapa natans&quot; that were collected in the vicinity of Boston, during the present year, brought to me for identification, and I have entertained no doubt as to the manner of its introduction into waters outside Cambridge Botanic Garden. But that so fine a plant as this, with its handsome leafy rosettes and edible nuts, which would, if common, be as attractive to boys as hickory nuts now are, can ever become a &#x27;nuisance&#x27; I can scarcely believe.&quot;

Water caltrop has been declared an invasive species from Vermont to Virginia, and is classified as a noxious weed in Florida, North Carolina, and Washington. As of 2020, both &quot;T. natans&quot; and &quot;T. bicornis&quot; have been reported growing wild in the waterways of the United States. In 1956 &quot;T. natans&quot; was banned for sale or shipment in the United States, subject to a fine and imprisonment. The law was repealed in 2020.

== Parasite transmission ==

Fasciolopsiasis is an disease resulting from infection by the trematode &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot;, an intestinal fluke of humans, endemic in China, Southeast Asia, and India. The fluke can be transmitted via the surfaces of water plants, generally &quot;T. natans&quot; seedpods. During the metacercarial stage in their lifecycle, the larval flukes leave their water snail hosts, and swim away to form cysts on the surfaces of the plants. If infected plants are consumed raw or undercooked, the flukes can infect pigs, humans, and other animals.

== Uses ==

The fruits are edible raw or cooked, and the seeds can be eaten as well. It is also eaten on the occasion of Mid-Autumn Festival in the Sinosphere.

<doc id="1005384" wikidata="Q1904913" url="?curid=1005384" title="Martin Feldstein">
<text>Martin Stuart Feldstein ( ; November 25, 1939 – June 11, 2019) was an American economist. He was the George F. Baker Professor of Economics at Harvard University and the president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). He served as president and chief executive officer of the NBER from 1978 to 2008 (with the exception of 1982 to 1984). From 1982 to 1984, Feldstein served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and as chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan (where his deficit hawk views clashed with the Reagan administration&#x27;s large military expenditure policies). Feldstein was also a member of the Washington-based financial advisory body the Group of Thirty from 2003.

== Early life and education==
Feldstein was born in New York City to a Jewish family and graduated from South Side High School in Rockville Centre, New York. He completed his undergraduate education at Harvard University (BA, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, 1961), where he was affiliated with Adams House, and then attended Nuffield College, Oxford (B.Litt., 1963; M.A., 1964; D.Phil., 1967). He was a Research Fellow there from 1964 to 1965, an Official Fellow from 1965 to 1967 and was later an Honorary Fellow of the college.

== Career ==
In 1977, he received the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association, a prize which was awarded every two years until 2010 when it began to be awarded yearly. It is awarded to the economist under the age of 40 who is judged to have made the greatest contribution to economic science. That same year, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1989, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was among the ten most influential economists in the world, according to IDEAS/RePEc. He was the author of more than 300 research articles in economics and made contributions to health economics, international economics, and the economics of national security. However, he was known primarily for his greater contributions to macroeconomics, public finance and social insurance. Pioneering much of the research on the working mechanism and sustainability of public pension systems, he advanced the current understanding of the effects of social insurance. Feldstein was an avid advocate of Social Security reform and was a main driving force behind former President George W. Bush&#x27;s initiative of partial privatization of the Social Security system. Aside from his contributions to the field of public sector economics, he also authored other important macroeconomics papers. One of his more well-known papers in this field was his investigation with Charles Horioka of investment behavior in various countries. He and Horioka found that in the long run, capital tends to stay in its home country — that is to say, a nation&#x27;s savings is used to fund its investment opportunities. This has since been known as the &quot;Feldstein–Horioka puzzle.&quot;

In 1997, writing about the upcoming European monetary union and the euro, Feldstein warned that the &quot;adverse economic effects of a single currency on unemployment and inflation would outweigh any gains from facilitating trade and capital flows&quot; and that, while &quot;conceived of as a way of reducing the risk of another intra-European war&quot;, it was &quot;more likely to have the opposite effect&quot; and &quot;lead to increased conflicts within Europe and between Europe and the United States.&quot;

In 2005, Feldstein was widely considered a leading candidate to succeed chairman Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. This was in part due to his prominence in the Reagan administration and his position as an economic advisor for the Bush presidential campaign. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an editorial advocating that Bush choose either Feldstein or Ben Bernanke due to their credentials, and the week of the nomination &quot;The Economist&quot; predicted that the two men had the greatest probability of selection out of the field of candidates. Ultimately, the position went to Bernanke, possibly because Feldstein was a board member of AIG, which announced the same year that it would restate five years of past financial reports by $2.7 billion. Subsequently, AIG suffered a serious financial collapse that played a central role in the worldwide economic crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing global recession. The firm was rescued only by multiple capital infusions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, which extended a $182.5 billion line of credit. Although Feldstein was not explicitly linked to the accounting practices in question, he had served as a Director of AIG since 1988. In March 2007, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation announced that one of four 2007 Bradley Prizes to honor outstanding achievement would be awarded to Feldstein. On September 10, 2007, Feldstein announced that he would be stepping down as president of NBER effective June 2008.

Feldstein served as a member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 2006 to 2009.

Feldstein said in March 2008 he believed the United States was in a recession and it could be a severe one.

As a member of the board of AIG Financial Products, Feldstein was one of those who had oversight of the division of the international insurer that contributed to the company&#x27;s crisis in September 2008. In May 2009, Feldstein announced he would step down as a director of AIG. He served as a board member for Eli Lilly and Company. He also previously served on the boards of several other public companies including JPMorgan and TRW.

On February 6, 2009, Feldstein was announced as one of U.S. President Obama&#x27;s advisors on the President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. He served as a member on the President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011.

=== Latter positions ===
He was a consultant to the U.S. Department of Defense.

He served on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Group of 30 and the National Committee on United States-China Relations. Feldstein was invited to participate in the Bilderberg Group annual conferences in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005–2008 and 2010 through 2015. He was also a member of the JP Morgan Chase International Council, a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the American Enterprise Institute, and a member of the British Academy.

In 2011 he was included in the 50 Most Influential People in Global Finance ranking of Bloomberg Markets Magazine.

In 2017, Feldstein joined a small group of &quot;Republican elder statesmen&quot; proposing that conservatives embrace carbon taxes, with all revenue rebated with lump-sum dividends, as a policy to deal with global climate change. The group also included James A. Baker III, N. Gregory Mankiw, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and George P. Shultz.

== Significant interests and publications ==
=== &quot;Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows&quot; ===
Published in 1980, &quot;Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows&quot; article made a significant contribution to international economics. Feldstein along with Charles Horioka contributed to the overall understanding of the international capital market by revealing the essence of the flow of capital in the world capital market. By examining the relationship between domestic investment and domestic savings of 21 OECD countries, Feldstein and Horioka provide statistical estimates revealing that almost all incremental savings of a country will remain in that country despite greater investment opportunities abroad. Puzzled by the unexpected direct relationship between domestic savings and investment, Feldstein and Horioka&#x27;s findings have become known as the &quot;Feldstein-Horioka Puzzle&quot;.

=== &quot;Social Security, Induced Retirement, and Aggregate Capital Accumulation&quot; ===
Published in 1974, &quot;Social Security, Induced Retirement, and Aggregate Capital Accumulation&quot; made a significant contribution to social insurance. Feldstein facilitated a greater understanding of the effects of social security upon household consumption and savings. The article provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of social security on an individual&#x27;s decision regarding retirement and the amount of savings necessary for such retirement. Feldstein claimed that Social Security results in individuals deciding to save less for retirement and to retire earlier.

Eight years after Feldstein&#x27;s study, Dean Leimer and Selig Lesnoy of the U.S. Social Security Administration attempted to replicate his results and uncovered programming mistakes in Feldstein&#x27;s analysis that invalidated his earlier results, which Feldstein acknowledged and issued a retraction. They also found what they deemed unreasonable assumptions in the construction of the social security wealth variable. After correcting these issues, Leimer and Lesnoy found a much weaker relationship between Social Security and personal savings than Feldstein had originally suggested. In fact, their results indicated that Social Security may have contributed to increased savings.

=== European Union, euro and sovereign debt crisis ===
Feldstein participated in the academic and popular debate on the European Union (EU) and the European common currency from its early stages, with increased interest during the sovereign debt crisis. Taking a political economy perspective, Feldstein argued that the European Union project in general and the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in particular were driven by a strange mix of pro-European internationalism and the pursuit of strictly national interests. Although nuanced in his criticism, Feldstein can be characterized as a Eurosceptic. Feldstein, an enthusiastic supporter of a single market for goods and services in the EU, argued that this goal does not require a monetary union. Furthermore, the creation of a single currency in the EU would increase political tensions in the union, as not all countries share the anti-inflationary stance of the German policy makers. In military and foreign policy, the objective of achieving a political union (of which the monetary unification is only one aspect) would promote the development of a common foreign and defense policy capable of projecting strength on the international scene. During the sovereign debt crisis, Feldstein argued in favor of a &quot;eurozone holiday&quot; solution whereby the countries most affected by the crisis (such as Greece) would temporarily leave the eurozone, revert to their national currencies, devalue and re-enter at a lower exchange rate a few years later, a policy that would ensure a boost in international competitiveness solid enough to offset the economic recession.

== Teaching ==
A well-known figure on the Harvard campus, Feldstein taught the introductory economics class &quot;Social Analysis 10: Principles of Economics&quot; for 20 years and was succeeded by N. Gregory Mankiw. The class, since renamed Economics 10, was usually the largest class at Harvard, which remains the case. He also taught courses in American economic policy and public sector economics at Harvard College.

Feldstein may have made one of his greatest impacts by the concentration of his students in top echelons of government and academia, such as Larry Summers, former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury secretary; David Ellwood, dean of Harvard Kennedy School; and James Poterba, MIT professor and member of Bush&#x27;s tax reform advisory panel. Lawrence Lindsey, formerly Bush&#x27;s top economic adviser, wrote his doctoral thesis under Feldstein, as did Harvey S. Rosen, the previous chairman of the president&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, Douglas Elmendorf, the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, José Piñera, Chile&#x27;s Secretary of Labor and Social Security during its pension privatization in 1980–1981, Jeffrey Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, and Glenn Hubbard, Bush&#x27;s first chairman of the council and now dean of the Columbia Business School.

<text>James Breckenridge Speed (alternatively James Breckinridge Speed; January 4, 1844 – July 7, 1912) was an American corporate executive, entrepreneur, and philanthropist based in Louisville, Kentucky. He served as the President of the Louisville Railway Company and over the course of his life founded and led multiple public companies including the Louisville Cement Company and the Ohio Valley Telephone Company.

==Early life and family==
James Breckenridge Speed was born on January 4, 1844, in Boonville, Missouri to Marry Ellen (née Shallcross) and William Pope Speed, son of John Speed. His mother died when he was an infant. He came to Louisville as an 11-year-old, James B. Speed was raised there by aunt Lucy Fry Speed, thus always considered a Louisvillian. His parents and siblings were all born in Louisville, and his family was the influential Speed family, which had had a great impact on the city. His uncle, also a James Speed, was United States Attorney General in Abraham Lincoln second term Cabinet and for a short time Andrew Johnson&#x27;s.

Speed attended local schools in Louisville and graduated from the Louisville High School.

==Career==
Speed was a clerk at the banking house of A. C. and O. F. Badger. He then moved to Chicago and worked in the office of Badger &amp; Co. Speed enlisted with the 1st Ohio Battery and was later made adjutant of the 27th Kentucky Infantry Regiment under Colonel Pennypacker. He was engaged in the battles in Atlanta and Knoxville. He left service in the spring of 1865.

Shortly after the war, Speed left Chicago. Speed was a financial leader who strongly influenced Louisville&#x27;s development. He helped to establish Louisville&#x27;s street railway system and became the president of the Louisville Railway Company. He saw early how significant cement would be in the growth of America, and he became the president of the Louisville Cement Company. He developed and operated large coal interests, and served as president of the Ohio Valley Telephone Company. Speed served as president of Louisville&#x27;s Woolen Mills Company from 1898 until he resigned in 1903. He also served as president of Louisville Cotton Mills Company for about six years and then served as vice president until his death.

==Philanthropy==

As a philanthropist, he donated a statue of Abraham Lincoln, which stands in the State Capitol, and he helped to establish and maintain several schools. After his death, his wife, Hattie Bishop and his children William S. Speed and Olive Speed Sackett, set up a foundation in his name which helped to found the Speed Art Museum and the J. B. Speed School of Engineering of the University of Louisville.

==Death==
After suffering from Bright&#x27;s disease (modern-day nephritis) for years and experiencing heart issues, Speed died on July 7, 1912, at Hotel Samoset in Rockland, Maine, where he spent his summers. He was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

<text>Lieutenant Kijé or Kizhe (, translit. Poruchik Kizhe), originally Kizh (Киж), is a fictional character in an anecdote about the reign of Emperor Paul I of Russia, in which the cover up of a transcription error leads to the creation of a fictional soldier, Kijé, and his rise through the ranks. When Paul asks to meet the now renowned officer, the creators of the hoax are cornered into a final lie that the soldier has died in battle. The story was used as the basis of a novella by Yury Tynyanov published in 1928 and filmed in 1934 with music by Sergei Prokofiev. The plot is a satire on bureaucracy.

==Original version==

The first appearance of the anecdote is in Vladimir Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Stories of the time of Paul I&quot; (), a short piece published in the journal &quot;Russkaya Starina&quot; in 1870; he reported it as told by his father, Jochan Christian von Dahl (1764-1821). In this original version, a clerk miswrites an order promoting several ensigns (&quot;praporshchiki&quot;) to second lieutenants (&quot;podporuchiki&quot;): instead of &quot;praporshchiki zh ... - v podporuchiki&quot; (&quot;as to Ensigns (names), [they are promoted to] Second Lieutenants&quot;), he writes &quot;praporshchik Kizh, ... - v podporuchiki&quot; (&quot;Ensign Kizh, (other names) [are promoted to] Second Lieutenants&quot;). The Emperor Paul decides to promote the nonexistent Kizh to first lieutenant (&quot;poruchik&quot;); he quickly rises through the ranks to staff captain and full captain, and when he is promoted to colonel the emperor commands that Kizh appear before him. Of course no Kizh can be found; the military bureaucrats go through the paper trail and discover the original mistake, but they decide to tell the emperor that Kizh has died. &quot;What a pity,&quot; the emperor says, &quot;he was a good officer.&quot;

==Tynyanov version==

Yury Tynyanov, who had been researching the period for his historical novels &quot;Kyukhlya&quot; (1925) and &quot;Smert Vazir-mukhtara&quot; (&quot;The death of the ambassador plenipotentiary&quot;, 1928), wrote a novella based on Dahl&#x27;s story that was published in 1928 in &quot;Krasnaya Nov&quot; No.1. He considerably expanded it, adding several characters (including the historical statesman Aleksey Arakcheyev), and changed the imaginary officer&#x27;s name from Kizh to Kizhe (using an alternative form of the particle, &quot;zhe&quot;). In his version, along with the imaginary Kizhe there is another mistake: a Lieutenant Sinyukhaev is wrongly marked as dead. Several sections of the novella are devoted to Sinyukhaev&#x27;s fruitless attempts to get himself restored (he ends up wandering the roads of Russia, living on the charity of strangers).

Tynyanov further complicates the story by adding a lady-in-waiting who has had a brief affair with an officer who shouts &quot;Guard!&quot; in the courtyard, disturbing the emperor; when the offender cannot be found, the emperor Paul is told that it was Kizhe, who is accordingly flogged and sent to Siberia (the fact that no actual person is there does not seem to bother anyone). This upsets the lady-in-waiting, but when the emperor changes his mind and has Kizhe returned to the capital and promoted, the lady-in-waiting is able to marry him (there is no groom at the ceremony but it proceeds as scheduled, and she has a child from her brief encounter), and she quite happily lives in his quarters, carrying on affairs, while he is supposedly in the field with his regiment. In the end the emperor, increasingly paranoid and lonely, feels the need to have someone as dependable as Kizhe (who has had a spotless career) near him, promotes him to general, and orders him brought to his palace in Saint Petersburg. Since this is impossible, he is told that Kizhe has died, and the general has a state funeral as the grieving emperor says &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi.&quot; The last line of the story reads &quot;And Pavel Petrovich [the emperor Paul] died in March of the same year as General Kizhe — according to official reports, from apoplexy.&quot; (In fact, Paul was murdered by a group of dismissed officers, but the royal physician did pronounce it apoplexy.)

== Film ==
The story was made into the 1934 film &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot;, directed by Aleksandr Faintsimmer, which is now remembered primarily for its soundtrack, the first instance of the composer Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;new simplicity&quot;.

==Parody==
The story is often parodied in fictional works making fun of bureaucracies, most famously in the form of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Tuttle&quot;, featuring a fictional captain of similar provenance.

==Spelling==
The conventional romanization of the title is &quot;Kizhé&quot; (Киже). The usual spelling &quot;Kijé&quot; corresponds to correct pronunciation in French (IPA: ⟨ʑ⟩), but in many other languages, such as English, German and Spanish, this French spelling often leads to mispronunciation. The &quot;Ж&quot; sound is a voiced &quot;sh&quot;, and sounds like the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;measure&quot; when said by a speaker of American English. (The Russian actor Igor&#x27; Zhizhikin (Игорь Жижикин) also uses the French transliteration, Jijikine, for his name, leading to similar mispronunciation.)

<text>Learning styles refer to a range of theories that aim to account for differences in individuals&#x27; learning. Although there is ample evidence that individuals express personal preferences on how they prefer to receive information, few studies have found validity in using learning styles in education. Many theories share the proposition that humans can be classified according to their &quot;style&quot; of learning, but differ on how the proposed styles should be defined, categorized and assessed. A common concept is that individuals differ in how they learn.

The idea of individualized learning styles became popular in the 1970s. This has greatly influenced education despite the criticism that the idea has received from some researchers. Proponents recommend that teachers run a needs analysis to assess the learning styles of their students and adapt their classroom methods to best fit each student&#x27;s learning style. There are many different types of learning models that have been created and used since the 1970s. Many of the models have similar fundamental ideas and are derived from other existing models, such as the improvement from the Learning Modalities and VAK model to the VARK model. However, critics claim that there is no consistent evidence that better student outcomes result from identifying an individual student&#x27;s learning style and teaching for specific learning styles.

==Overview of models==
There are many different learning styles models; one literature review identified 71 different models. Only a few models are described below.

===David Kolb&#x27;s model===

David A. Kolb&#x27;s model is based on his experiential learning model, as explained in his book &quot;Experiential Learning&quot;. Kolb&#x27;s model outlines two related approaches toward grasping experience: &quot;Concrete Experience&quot; and &quot;Abstract Conceptualization&quot;, as well as two related approaches toward transforming experience: &quot;Reflective Observation&quot; and &quot;Active Experimentation&quot;. According to Kolb&#x27;s model, the ideal learning process engages all four of these modes in response to situational demands; they form a learning cycle from experience to observation to conceptualization to experimentation and back to experience. In order for learning to be effective, Kolb postulated, all four of these approaches must be incorporated. As individuals attempt to use all four approaches, they may tend to develop strengths in one experience-grasping approach and one experience-transforming approach, leading them to prefer one of the following four learning styles:

# Accommodator = &quot;Concrete Experience + Active Experiment&quot;: strong in &quot;hands-on&quot; practical doing (e.g., physical therapists)
# Converger = &quot;Abstract Conceptualization + Active Experiment&quot;: strong in practical &quot;hands-on&quot; application of theories (e.g., engineers)
# Diverger = &quot;Concrete Experience + Reflective Observation&quot;: strong in imaginative ability and discussion (e.g., social workers)
# Assimilator = &quot;Abstract Conceptualization + Reflective Observation&quot;: strong in inductive reasoning and creation of theories (e.g., philosophers)

Kolb&#x27;s model gave rise to the Learning Style Inventory, an assessment method used to determine an individual&#x27;s learning style. According to this model, individuals may exhibit a preference for one of the four styles—Accommodating, Converging, Diverging and Assimilating—depending on their approach to learning in Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning model.

===Peter Honey and Alan Mumford&#x27;s model===
Peter Honey and Alan Mumford adapted Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning model. First, they renamed the stages in the learning cycle to accord with managerial experiences: &quot;having&quot; an experience, &quot;reviewing&quot; the experience, &quot;concluding&quot; from the experience, and &quot;planning&quot; the next steps. Second, they aligned these stages to four learning styles named:

# Activist
# Reflector
# Theorist 
# Pragmatist

These learning styles are not innate to an individual but rather are developed based on an individual&#x27;s experiences and preferences. Based on this model, the Honey and Mumford&#x27;s Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ) was developed to allow individuals to assess and reflect on how they consume information and learn from their experiences. It serves as an alternative to Kolb&#x27;s LSI as it directly asks about common behaviors found in the workplace compared to judging how an individual learns. Having completed the self-assessment, managers are encouraged to focus on strengthening underutilized styles in order to become better equipped to learn from a wide range of everyday experiences. A MORI survey commissioned by The Campaign for Learning in 1999 found the Honey and Mumford LSQ to be the most widely used system for assessing preferred learning styles in the local government sector in the UK.

===Learning modalities===

Walter Burke Barbe and colleagues proposed three learning modalities (often identified by the acronym VAK):

# Visualizing modality
# Auditory modality
# Kinesthetic modality

Barbe and colleagues reported that learning modality strengths can occur independently or in combination (although the most frequent modality strengths, according to their research, are visual or mixed), they can change over time, and they become integrated with age. They also pointed out that learning modality &quot;strengths&quot; are different from &quot;preferences&quot;; a person&#x27;s self-reported modality preference may not correspond to their empirically measured modality strength. This disconnect between strengths and preferences was confirmed by a subsequent study. Nevertheless, some scholars have criticized the VAK model. Psychologist Scott Lilienfeld and colleagues have argued that much use of the VAK model is nothing more than pseudoscience or a psychological urban legend.

===Neil Fleming&#x27;s VAK/VARK model===

Neil Fleming&#x27;s VARK model and inventory expanded upon earlier notions of sensory modalities such as the VAK model of Barbe and colleagues and the representational systems (VAKOG) in neuro-linguistic programming. The four sensory modalities in Fleming&#x27;s model are:

# Visual learning
# Aural learning
# Reading/writing learning
# Kinesthetic learning

While the fifth modality isn&#x27;t considered one of the four learning styles, it covers those who fit equally among two or more areas, or without one frontrunner:

# Multimodality (MM)

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Subsequent neuroimaging research has suggested that visual learners convert words into images in the brain and vice versa, but some psychologists have argued that this &quot;is not an instance of learning styles, rather, it is an instance of ability appearing as a style&quot;. Likewise, Fleming claimed that auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.), and tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world, science projects, experiments, etc.). Students can use the model and inventory to identify their preferred learning style and, it is claimed, improve their learning by focusing on the mode that benefits them the most. Fleming&#x27;s model also posits two types of multimodality. This means that not everyone has one defined preferred modality of learning; some people may have a mixture that makes up their preferred learning style. There are two types of multimodality learners: VARK type one learners are able to assimilate their learning style to those around them. VARK type two learners need to receive input or output in all of their preferred styles. They will continue to work until all preferred learning areas have been met.

===Gregorc &amp; Butler&#x27;s model===
Anthony Gregorc and Kathleen Butler organized a model describing different learning styles rooted in the way individuals acquire and process information differently. This model posits that an individual&#x27;s perceptual abilities are the foundation of his or her specific learning strengths, or learning styles.

In this model, there are two perceptual qualities: &quot;concrete&quot; and &quot;abstract&quot;, and two ordering abilities: &quot;random&quot; and &quot;sequential&quot;. Concrete perceptions involve registering information through the five senses, while abstract perceptions involve the understanding of ideas, qualities, and concepts which cannot be seen. In regard to the two ordering abilities, sequential ordering involves the organization of information in a linear, logical way, and random ordering involves the organization of information in chunks and in no specific order. The model posits that both of the perceptual qualities and both of the ordering abilities are present in each individual, but some qualities and ordering abilities are more dominant within certain individuals.

There are four combinations of perceptual qualities and ordering abilities based on dominance: &quot;concrete sequential&quot;, &quot;abstract random&quot;, &quot;abstract sequential&quot;, and &quot;concrete random&quot;. The model posits that individuals with different combinations learn in different ways—they have different strengths, different things make sense to them, different things are difficult for them, and they ask different questions throughout the learning process.

The validity of Gregorc&#x27;s model has been questioned by Thomas Reio and Albert Wiswell following experimental trials. Gregorc argues that his critics have &quot;scientifically-limited views&quot; and that they wrongly repudiate the &quot;mystical elements&quot; of &quot;the spirit&quot; that can only be discerned by a &quot;subtle human instrument&quot;.

===Cognitive approaches===
Anthony Grasha and Sheryl Riechmann, in 1974, formulated the Grasha-Reichmann Learning Style Scale. It was developed to analyze the attitudes of students and how they approach learning. The test was originally designed to provide teachers with insight on how to approach instructional plans for college students. Grasha&#x27;s background was in cognitive processes and coping techniques. Unlike some models of cognitive styles which are relatively nonjudgmental, Grasha and Riechmann distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive styles. The names of Grasha and Riechmann&#x27;s learning styles are:

*avoidant
*participative
*competitive
*collaborative
*dependent
*independent

Aiming to explain why aptitude tests, school grades, and classroom performance often fail to identify real ability, Robert Sternberg listed various cognitive dimensions in his book &quot;Thinking Styles&quot;. Several other models are also often used when researching cognitive styles; some of these models are described in books that Sternberg co-edited, such as &quot;Perspectives on Thinking, Learning, and Cognitive Styles&quot;.

===NASSP model===
In the 1980s, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) formed a task force to study learning styles. The task force defined three broad categories of style—cognitive, affective, and physiological—and 31 variables, including the perceptual strengths and preferences from the VAK model of Barbe and colleagues, but also many other variables such as need for structure, types of motivation, time of day preferences, and so on. They defined a learning style as &quot;a &quot;gestalt&quot;—not an amalgam of related characteristics but greater than any of its parts. It is a composite of internal and external operations based in neurobiology, personality, and human development and reflected in learner behavior.&quot;

* Cognitive styles are preferred ways of perception, organization and retention.
* Affective styles represent the motivational dimensions of the learning personality; each learner has a personal motivational approach.
* Physiological styles are bodily states or predispositions, including sex-related differences, health and nutrition, and reaction to physical surroundings, such as preferences for levels of light, sound, and temperature.

According to the NASSP task force, styles are hypothetical constructs that help to explain the learning (and teaching) process. They posited that one can recognize the learning style of an individual student by observing his or her behavior. Learning has taken place only when one observes a relatively stable change in learner behavior resulting from what has been experienced.

=== Felder and Silverman&#x27;s model ===
Richard Felder and Linda Silverman developed their own index for determining learning styles. The Felder Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) is a type of learning styles based on a two-step process, where the individual first receives the information through an internal or external mean and then processes it.

Felder and Silverman discovered five areas that affected learning:

# Active/Reflective
# Visual/Verbal
# Sensing/Intuition
# Sequential/Global
# Inductive/Deductive

They placed each of the opposing areas on a spectrum, stating that when students used the entire spectrum, they achieved optimal learning. In 2002, Felder removed the Inductive and Deductive portion because it did not fit the model well given the differences in inductive and deductive teaching methods. Felder and Silverman placed Active, Visual, Sensing, and Sequential on one side of the spectrum and their counterparts on the opposing side.

Felder also noted, however, that while full understanding of the spectrum allows for optimal learning, that mismatches do exist. Specifically, when a professor does not teach to the learning styles of their students, many students tend to lose interest in the class, going as far as changing to other studies or dropping out of school entirely.

==Assessment methods==
A 2004 non-peer-reviewed literature review criticized most of the main instruments used to identify an individual&#x27;s learning style. In conducting the review, Frank Coffield and his colleagues selected 13 of the most influential models of the 71 models they identified, including most of the models described in this article. They examined the theoretical origins and terms of each model, and the instrument that purported to assess individuals against the learning styles defined by the model. They analyzed the claims made by the author(s), external studies of these claims, and independent empirical evidence of the relationship between the learning style identified by the instrument and students&#x27; actual learning. Coffield&#x27;s team found that none of the most popular learning style theories had been adequately validated through independent research. This means that even if the underlying theories were sound, educators are frequently unable to correctly identify the theoretically correct learning style for any given student, so the theory would end up being misapplied in practice.

===Learning Style Inventory===
The Learning Style Inventory (LSI) is connected with David A. Kolb&#x27;s model and is used to determine a student&#x27;s learning style. Previous versions of the LSI have been criticized for problems with validity, reliability, and other issues. Version 4 of the Learning Style Inventory replaces the four learning styles of previous versions with nine new learning styles: initiating, experiencing, imagining, reflecting, analyzing, thinking, deciding, acting, and balancing. The LSI is intended to help employees or students &quot;understand how their learning style impacts upon problem solving, teamwork, handling conflict, communication and career choice; develop more learning flexibility; find out why teams work well—or badly—together; strengthen their overall learning.&quot;

A completely different Learning Styles Inventory is associated with a binary division of learning styles, developed by Felder and Silverman. Their model interprets learning styles as a balance between pairs of extremes, and the four scores provided by a questionnaire describes these balances. Like the LSI mentioned above, this inventory provides overviews and synopses for teachers.

===NASSP Learning Style Profile===
The NASSP Learning Style Profile (LSP) is a second-generation instrument for the diagnosis of student cognitive styles, perceptual responses, and study and instructional preferences. The LSP is a diagnostic tool intended as the basis for comprehensive style assessment with students in the sixth to twelfth grades. It was developed by the National Association of Secondary School Principals research department in conjunction with a national task force of learning style experts. The Profile was developed in four phases with initial work undertaken at the University of Vermont (cognitive elements), Ohio State University (affective elements), and St. John&#x27;s University (physiological/environmental elements). Rigid validation and normative studies were conducted using factor analytic methods to ensure strong construct validity and subscale independence.

The LSP contains 23 scales representing four higher order factors: cognitive styles, perceptual responses, study preferences and instructional preferences (the affective and physiological elements). The LSP scales are: analytic skill, spatial skill, discrimination skill, categorizing skill, sequential processing skill, simultaneous processing skill, memory skill, perceptual response: visual, perceptual response: auditory, perceptual response: emotive, persistence orientation, verbal risk orientation, verbal-spatial preference, manipulative preference, study time preference: early morning, study time preference: late morning, study time preference: afternoon, study time preference: evening, grouping preference, posture preference, mobility preference, sound preference, lighting preference, temperature preference.

===Other methods===
Other methods (usually questionnaires) used to identify learning styles include Neil Fleming&#x27;s VARK Questionnaire and Jackson&#x27;s Learning Styles Profiler. Many other tests have gathered popularity and various levels of credibility among students and teachers.

==In the classroom==
For a teacher to use the learning styles model, the teacher has to be able to correctly match each student to a learning style. This is a generally unsuccessful exercise due to inappropriate tools. For an assessment tool to be useful, it needs to be a valid test, which is to say that it actually has to put all of the &quot;style A&quot; students in the &quot;A&quot; group, all of the &quot;style B&quot; students in the &quot;B&quot; group, and so forth. Research indicates that very few, if any, of the psychometric tests promoted in conjunction with the learning styles idea have the necessary validity to be useful in practice. Some models, such as Anthony Gregorc&#x27;s Gregorc Style Delineator, are &quot;theoretically and psychometrically flawed&quot; and &quot;not suitable for the assessment of individuals&quot;.

Furthermore, knowing a student&#x27;s learning style does not seem to have any practical value for the student. In 2019, the American Association of Anatomists published a study that investigated whether learning styles had any effect on the final outcomes of an anatomy course. The study found that even when being told they had a specific learning style, the students did not change their study habits, and those students that did use their theoretically dominant learning style had no greater success in the course; specific study strategies, unrelated to learning style, were positively correlated with final course grade.

=== Dunn and Dunn ===
Various researchers have attempted to hypothesize ways in which learning style theory can be used in the classroom. Two such scholars are Rita Dunn and Kenneth Dunn, who build upon a learning modalities approach.

Although learning styles will inevitably differ among students in the classroom, Dunn and Dunn say that teachers should try to make changes in their classroom that will be beneficial to every learning style. Some of these changes include room redesign, the development of small-group techniques, and the development of &quot;contract activity packages&quot;. Redesigning the classroom involves locating dividers that can be used to arrange the room creatively (such as having different learning stations and instructional areas), clearing the floor area, and incorporating students&#x27; thoughts and ideas into the design of the classroom.

Dunn and Dunn&#x27;s &quot;contract activity packages&quot; are educational plans that use: a clear statement of the learning need; multisensory resources (auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic); activities through which the newly mastered information can be used creatively; the sharing of creative projects within small groups; at least three small-group techniques; a pre-test, a self-test, and a post-test.

Dunn and Dunn&#x27;s learning styles model is widely used in schools in the United States, and 177 articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals referring to this model. However, the conclusion of a review by Coffield and colleagues was: &quot;Despite a large and evolving research programme, forceful claims made for impact are questionable because of limitations in many of the supporting studies and the lack of independent research on the model.&quot;

=== Sprenger&#x27;s differentiation ===
Another scholar who believes that learning styles should have an effect on the classroom is Marilee Sprenger in &quot;Differentiation through Learning Styles and Memory&quot;. She bases her work on three premises:
#Teachers can be learners, and learners teachers. We are all both.
#Everyone can learn under the right circumstances.
#Learning is fun! Make it appealing.

Sprenger details how to teach in visual, auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic ways. Methods for visual learners include ensuring that students can see words written, using pictures, and drawing timelines for events. Methods for auditory learners include repeating words aloud, small-group discussion, debates, listening to books on tape, oral reports, and oral interpretation. Methods for tactile/kinesthetic learners include hands-on activities (experiments, etc.), projects, frequent breaks to allow movement, visual aids, role play, and field trips. By using a variety of teaching methods from each of these categories, teachers cater to different learning styles at once, and improve learning by challenging students to learn in different ways.

James W. Keefe and John M. Jenkins have incorporated learning style assessment as a basic component in their &quot;personalized instruction&quot; model of schooling. Six basic elements constitute the culture and context of personalized instruction. The cultural components—teacher role, student learning characteristics, and collegial relationships—establish the foundation of personalization and ensure that the school prizes a caring and collaborative environment. The contextual factors—interactivity, flexible scheduling, and authentic assessment—establish the structure of personalization.

According to Keefe and Jenkins, cognitive and learning style analysis have a special role in the process of personalizing instruction. The assessment of student learning style, more than any other element except the teacher role, establishes the foundation for a personalized approach to schooling: for student advisement and placement, for appropriate retraining of student cognitive skills, for adaptive instructional strategy, and for the authentic evaluation of learning. Some learners respond best in instructional environments based on an analysis of their perceptual and environmental style preferences: most individualized and personalized teaching methods reflect this point of view. Other learners, however, need help to function successfully in &quot;any&quot; learning environment. If a youngster cannot cope under conventional instruction, enhancing his cognitive skills may make successful achievement possible.

Many of the student learning problems that learning style diagnosis attempts to solve relate directly to elements of the human information processing system. Processes such as attention, perception and memory, and operations such as integration and retrieval of information are internal to the system. Any hope for improving student learning necessarily involves an understanding and application of information processing theory. Learning style assessment can provide a window to understanding and managing this process.

At least one study evaluating teaching styles and learning styles, however, has found that congruent groups have no significant differences in achievement from incongruent groups. Furthermore, learning style in this study varied by demography, specifically by age, suggesting a change in learning style as one gets older and acquires more experience. While significant age differences did occur, as well as no experimental manipulation of classroom assignment, the findings do call into question the aim of congruent teaching–learning styles in the classroom.

Educational researchers Eileen Carnell and Caroline Lodge concluded that learning styles are not fixed and that they are dependent on circumstance, purpose and conditions.

==Criticism==
Learning style theories have been criticized by many scholars and researchers. Some psychologists and neuroscientists have questioned the scientific basis for separating out students based on learning style. According to Susan Greenfield the practice is &quot;nonsense&quot; from a neuroscientific point of view: &quot;Humans have evolved to build a picture of the world through our senses working in unison, exploiting the immense interconnectivity that exists in the brain.&quot; Similarly, Christine Harrington argued that since all students are multisensory learners, educators should teach research-based general learning skills.

Since 2012, learning styles have often been referred to as a &quot;neuromyth&quot; in education, which is believed by up to 89% of educators. There is evidence of empirical and pedagogical problems related to forcing learning tasks to &quot;correspond to differences in a one-to-one fashion&quot;. Studies contradict the widespread &quot;meshing hypothesis&quot; that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student&#x27;s learning style.

Studies further show that teachers cannot assess the learning style of their students accurately. In one study, students were asked to take an inventory of their learning styles. After nearly 400 students completed the inventory, 70% did not use study habits that matched their preferred learning method. This study also indicated that students who used study methods that matched their preferred learning style performed no better on tests than students who did not.

Many educational psychologists have shown that there is little evidence for the efficacy of most learning style models, and furthermore, that the models often rest on dubious theoretical grounds. According to professor of education Steven Stahl, there has been an &quot;utter failure to find that assessing children&#x27;s learning styles and matching to instructional methods has any effect on their learning.&quot; Professor of education Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as VARK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning. Similarly, psychologist Kris Vasquez pointed out a number of problems with learning styles, including the lack of empirical evidence that learning styles are useful in producing student achievement, but also her more serious concern that the use of learning styles in the classroom could lead students to develop self-limiting implicit theories about themselves that could become self-fulfilling prophecies that are harmful, rather than beneficial, to the goal of serving student diversity.

Some research has shown that long-term retention can better be achieved under conditions that seem more difficult, and that teaching students only in their preferred learning style is not effective.

Psychologists Scott Lilienfeld, Barry Beyerstein, and colleagues listed as one of the &quot;50 great myths of popular psychology&quot; the idea that &quot;students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their learning styles&quot;, and they summarized some relevant reasons not to believe this &quot;myth&quot;.

===Other critiques===
Coffield and his colleagues and Mark Smith are not alone in their judgements. In 2005, Demos, a UK think tank, published a report on learning styles prepared by a group chaired by David Hargreaves that included Usha Goswami from the University of Cambridge and David Wood from the University of Nottingham. The Demos report said that the evidence for learning styles was &quot;highly variable&quot;, and that practitioners were &quot;not by any means always frank about the evidence for their work&quot;.

Cautioning against interpreting neuropsychological research as supporting the applicability of learning style theory, John Geake, Professor of Education at the UK&#x27;s Oxford Brookes University, and a research collaborator with Oxford University&#x27;s Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, commented in 2005: &quot;We need to take extreme care when moving from the lab to the classroom. We do remember things visually and aurally, but information isn&#x27;t defined by how it was received.&quot;

The work of Daniel T. Willingham, a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist, has argued that there is not enough evidence to support a theory describing the differences in learning styles amongst students. In his 2009 book &quot;Why Don&#x27;t Students Like School&quot;, he claimed that a cognitive styles theory must have three features: &quot;it should consistently attribute to a person the same style, it should show that people with different abilities think and learn differently, and it should show that people with different styles do not, on average, differ in ability&quot;. He concluded that there are no theories that have these three crucial characteristics, not necessarily implying that cognitive styles don&#x27;t exist but rather stating that psychologists have been unable to &quot;find them&quot;. In a 2008 self-published YouTube video titled &quot;Learning Styles Don&#x27;t Exist&quot;, Willingham concluded by saying: &quot;Good teaching is good teaching and teachers don&#x27;t need to adjust their teaching to individual students&#x27; learning styles.&quot;

===2009 APS critique===
In late 2009, the journal &quot;Psychological Science in the Public Interest&quot; of the Association for Psychological Science (APS) published a report on the scientific validity of learning styles practices. The panel of experts that wrote the article, led by Harold Pashler of the University of California, San Diego, concluded that an adequate evaluation of the learning styles hypothesis—the idea that optimal learning demands that students receive instruction tailored to their learning styles—requires a particular kind of study. Specifically, students should be grouped into the learning style categories that are being evaluated (e.g., visual learners vs. verbal learners), and then students in each group must be randomly assigned to one of the learning methods (e.g., visual learning or verbal learning), so that some students will be &quot;matched&quot; and others will be &quot;mismatched&quot;. At the end of the experiment, all students must sit for the same test. If the learning style hypothesis is correct, then, for example, visual learners should learn better with the visual method, whereas auditory learners should learn better with the auditory method. As disclosed in the report, the panel found that studies utilizing this essential research design were virtually absent from the learning styles literature. In fact, the panel was able to find only a few studies with this research design, and all but one of these studies were negative findings—that is, they found that the same learning method was superior for all kinds of students. Examples of such negative findings include the research of Laura J. Massa and Richard E. Mayer, as well as more recent research since the 2009 review.

Furthermore, the panel noted that, even if the requisite finding were obtained, the benefits would need to be large, and not just statistically significant, before learning style interventions could be recommended as cost-effective. That is, the cost of evaluating and classifying students by their learning style, and then providing customized instruction would need to be more beneficial than other interventions (e.g., one-on-one tutoring, after school remediation programs, etc.).

As a consequence, the panel concluded, &quot;at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number.&quot;

The article incited critical comments from some defenders of learning styles. &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported that Robert Sternberg from Tufts University spoke out against the paper: &quot;Several of the most-cited researchers on learning styles, Mr. Sternberg points out, do not appear in the paper&#x27;s bibliography.&quot; This charge was also discussed by &quot;Science&quot;, which reported that Pashler said, &quot;Just so... most of [the evidence] is &#x27;weak&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Chronicle&quot; reported that even David A. Kolb partly agreed with Pashler; Kolb said: &quot;The paper correctly mentions the practical and ethical problems of sorting people into groups and labeling them. Tracking in education has a bad history.&quot;

=== Subsequent critiques ===
A 2013 study pointed out that Kolb&#x27;s Learning Style Inventory, among its other weaknesses, incorrectly dichotomizes individuals on the abstract/concrete and reflective/action dimensions of experiential learning (in much the same way as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator does in a different context), and proposed instead that these dimensions be treated as continuous rather than dichotomous/binary variables.

In an article that addressed Kolb&#x27;s work through 2005, Mark K. Smith reviewed some critiques of Kolb&#x27;s model, and identified six key issues regarding the model:
# The model doesn&#x27;t adequately address the process of reflection;
# The claims it makes about the four learning styles are extravagant;
# It doesn&#x27;t sufficiently address the fact of different cultural conditions and experiences;
# The idea of stages/steps doesn&#x27;t necessarily match reality;
# It has only weak empirical evidence;
# The relationship between learning processes and knowledge is more complex than Kolb draws it.
A 2015 review paper examined the studies of learning styles completed after the 2009 APS critique, giving particular attention to studies that used the experimental methods advocated for by Pashler et al. The findings were similar to those of the APS critique: the evidence for learning styles was virtually nonexistent while evidence contradicting it was both more prevalent and used more sound methodology. Follow-up studies concluded that learning styles had no effect on student retention of material whereas another explanation, dual coding, had a substantial impact on it and held more potential for practical application in the classroom.

A 2017 research paper from the UK found that 90% of academics agreed there are &quot;basic conceptual flaws&quot; with learning styles theory, yet 58% agreed that students &quot;learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style&quot;, and 33% reported that they used learning styles as a method in the past year. It concluded that it might be better to use methods that are &quot;demonstrably effective&quot;.

<text>Richard Alan Dutcher (born 1964) is an American independent filmmaker who produces, writes, directs, edits, and frequently stars in his films. After making &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;, a successful 2000 movie about LDS missionaries, Dutcher became well known among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Film critic Jeff Vice, of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, dubbed Dutcher &quot;The Godfather of Mormon Cinema,&quot; a title that is very important personally for Dutcher. In 2007, Dutcher left the LDS Church.

== Biography and personal life ==

Dutcher was born in Oak Park, Illinois as Richard Hill. His family moved frequently, and at age seven his parents divorced. As a member of the LDS Church, Dutcher served a two-year mission in Mexico.

Dutcher lived in his car during high school and was so financially strapped while attending college that he frequently had to choose between eating and going to the movies. Because of his love of film, he normally went to the movies. Dutcher graduated from Brigham Young University in 1988 with a degree in film. Dutcher was married in 1988 to Gwen, moving to Mapleton, Utah in 1999. They have seven children together. After 23 years of marriage, they divorced in 2011.

=== Film projects ===

==== &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; ====
Dutcher began work on his first feature film, &quot;Girl Crazy,&quot; in the early 1990s while living in an apartment in Van Nuys, California. &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; is a romantic comedy written by, directed by, and starring Dutcher. Dutcher raised the budget of the movie (approx US$14,000), then shot it in and near his apartment building. He later raised more money to finish the movie.

The movie did not play in theaters but had a brief run in 1997 on HBO and Cinemax. While the movie did not make enough money to pay off investors, it did begin Dutcher&#x27;s feature filmmaking career. Of the movie, Dutcher said:

==== &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; ====
Dutcher&#x27;s next film was the 2000 indie smash &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;. Distributed by Excel Entertainment Group, the movie grossed over ten times its $250,000 production budget. Dutcher produced, wrote, directed, and starred in this film about Mormon missionaries, focusing on a Mormon elder determined to finish his two-year mission even though he is dying of brain cancer. The film debuted with a world premiere in Sandy, Utah and was taken on tour around North America for limited engagements, particularly to Mormon audiences, who were eager to see LDS characters portrayed on screen. The movie received mixed reviews from critics. The success of &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; among Mormon audiences is credited (by Dutcher) for launching the LDS Cinema movement of the early to mid-2000s, a small film niche of LDS movies made primarily by and for Mormon audiences.

==== &quot;Brigham City&quot; ====
Dutcher followed this film in 2001 with &quot;Brigham City&quot;, a movie about the search for a serial murderer in a small Utah town which has never had a murder before. As with &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;, Dutcher wrote, directed, and cast himself as the lead, while Excel Entertainment Group distributed the film. The movie explores how residents of a close-knit religious community, who are mostly LDS, react to and deal with the situation. Overall, &quot;Brigham City&quot; garnered better reviews with critics than &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;, but only grossed $852,206 during its theatrical run, far less than &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;, despite being made with a much higher budget.

==== &quot;The Prophet&quot; ====
In 2003, Dutcher announced his most ambitious movie project to date: &quot;The Prophet&quot;, a biopic about the life of LDS Church founder Joseph Smith, based on a screenplay written by Dutcher. In a press conference held in Utah, Dutcher called the movie &quot;the Mount Everest of Mormon filmmaking&quot; and said that he planned to do &quot;the bulk of the filming&quot; in 2004 for a 2005 theatrical release. He also announced that both Val Kilmer and F. Murray Abraham had agreed to portray Joseph Smith and Gov. Thomas Ford of Illinois, respectively (depending on schedules). The budget of the movie was projected at more than $12 million. The movie was never made.

==== &quot;States of Grace&quot; ====
Dutcher&#x27;s next film, &quot;States of Grace&quot; (also titled &quot;God&#x27;s Army 2: States of Grace&quot;), was released November 4, 2005. This film follows a set of missionaries in Los Angeles caught in the middle of gang warfare. &quot;States of Grace&quot; received the highest percentage of positive reviews of any Dutcher movie. Wade Major of &quot;Boxoffice&quot;magazine wrote of the director, &quot;Dutcher has joined the ranks of the very best independent filmmakers in the world.&quot; However, the movie was also Dutcher&#x27;s lowest-grossing movie up until that time. &quot;States of Grace&quot; grossed $203,144 during its theatrical run, less than one-tenth the theatrical gross of &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;.

==== &quot;Falling&quot; ====
Dutcher&#x27;s next film, &quot;Falling&quot;, tells the story of a Hollywood videographer, Eric Boyle (played by Dutcher), who stumbles across a gang murder and sells the footage to a Los Angeles news station for a small fortune. Boyle&#x27;s life falls apart when the exposed gang members come after anyone with a connection to the incriminating footage. In an interview, Dutcher said that this was the most personal of all his works, and that he would self-distribute the film. The movie was shown on a single screen in Utah for one week in January 2008 and in Los Angeles in August 2008. It was then re-released on April 27, 2012, in Salt Lake City, Utah, on one screen at the Broadway Theater for several weeks. The movie has yet to be released on DVD or through other sources. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;Falling&quot; is, &quot;one of the best pictures of its kind in recent memory,&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles City Beat&quot; called it &quot;a primal scream from an immensely talented artist.&quot;

==== &quot;Evil Angel&quot; ====
In 2009, Dutcher made &quot;Evil Angel&quot;, an action/horror movie starring Kristopher Shepard with a supporting role by Ving Rhames (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;). As with his other films, Dutcher wrote, directed, and cast himself in a supporting role. The movie was originally announced to be released in October 2012 but has not had a US release. &quot;Evil Angel&quot; was a modest success in a few foreign markets, but Dutcher later testified in court he had not been paid proper royalties. Dutcher was a witness in the 2017 court case of Utah real estate investor Rick Koerber who funded the film and was later accused and convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme, funding the $5 million film production with money investors believed was used to buy properties.

==== &quot;Tryptic&quot; ====
In 2010, Dutcher launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to complete &quot;Tryptic&quot;, a feature film he was writing and directing. On the Kickstarter page for the movie, Dutcher explained his need for immediate funding:

The Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Tryptic&quot; set a goal to raise $7,000. On November 1, 2010, the campaign came to a successful conclusion, having raised $10,095—144% of its goal—from 73 backers. As of December 2014, the movie has not been completed.

==== &quot;Boys at the Bar&quot; ====
In 2012, Dutcher returned to his &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; roots and made &quot;The Boys at the Bar,&quot; a low-budget comedy that he wrote, directed, and starred in. The $150,000 budget for the movie was raised by 23 students from Dutcher&#x27;s self-titled &quot;Richard Dutcher&#x27;s Movie Producers Master Class.&quot; Dutcher, along with his 23 students, formed an organization called &quot;Project 23,&quot; in which all 23 students act as the movie&#x27;s producers and fundraisers. Shot over seven days in Salt Lake City from a heavily improvised script, the movie is &quot;conflict free&quot; and centers around a group of friends celebrating a birthday party and telling jokes. In May 2014, Dutcher stated that news of the film&#x27;s release would be coming soon.

=== Parting letter ===
In 2007, the &quot;Provo Daily Herald&quot; published an open letter from Dutcher on its editorial page where he announced, &quot;I am no longer a practicing member of the church.&quot; He explained that he had taken a spiritual journey that, &quot;may ultimately prove incompatible with Mormon orthodoxy.&quot; He hoped to explore human spirituality in film more broadly, but like early church leader Oliver Cowdery, someday he might return to the faith.

Dutcher lamented that Mormon cinema was dying from too many shallow, poor-quality films trying to &quot;make a few bucks.&quot; He urged Mormon cinema to abandon &quot;moronic,&quot; unfunny comedies that rely too much on self-mockery, and family films, which often lack any valuable meaning. He felt that church-produced movies fail to &quot;share ... the beauty and power of Mormonism,&quot; and are instead &quot;polite, remedial and not-so-factual recitations of Mormon History and scripture.&quot; The potential of Mormon cinema was still unappreciated and untapped. Dutcher thought the market could be revived by reintroducing well-crafted films that explore the great depths of Mormon themes and experience. Rather than just making &quot;clean&quot; movies, free from violence and vulgarity, Dutcher said, &quot;It is better to tell an R-rated truth than a G-rated lie.&quot;

This letter provoked strong criticism from some LDS Church members, most notably Kieth Merrill, a Mormon filmmaker whose work was included in Dutcher&#x27;s criticisms. In his fiery reaction, Merrill claimed Dutcher was arrogantly ignoring the importance of social and spiritual values. Merrill saw Dutcher as attacking LDS cinema because of the poor response to his latest films. Two days later, in a letter to the editor, Merrill apologized for his harsh criticisms, regretted the loss of Dutcher, and wished him well in his future.

=== Film plans ===
Dutcher at one point was planning to direct &quot;Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith&quot;, a film about the life of the early LDS prophet. While Dutcher did not specifically comment on his plans for his movie on Joseph Smith in his &quot;Parting words&quot; letter, Dutcher did state that he will no longer be making Mormon films.

Dutcher&#x27;s film &quot;Falling,&quot; was released January 18, 2008 at a single Salt Lake City theater, and later shopped to art-house theaters, where he did not expect to make back the film&#x27;s money. Dutcher&#x27;s &#x27;Parting words&#x27; letter suggests that these and future movies may be spiritually based but not Mormon-related.

<doc id="1005426" wikidata="Q247914" url="?curid=1005426" title="Erythrite">
<text>Erythrite, also known as red cobalt, previously &quot;cobalt ochre&quot; is a secondary hydrated cobalt arsenate mineral with the formula . Erythrite and annabergite, chemical formula , or nickel arsenate form a complete series with the general formula .
Erythrite crystallizes in the monoclinic system and forms prismatic crystals. The color is crimson to pink and occurs as a secondary coating known as &quot;cobalt bloom&quot; on cobalt arsenide minerals. Well-formed crystals are rare, with most of the mineral manifesting in crusts or small reniform aggregates.

Erythrite was first described in 1832 for an occurrence in Grube Daniel, Schneeberg, Saxony, and takes its name from the Greek έρυθρος (&quot;erythros&quot;), meaning red. Historically, erythrite itself has not been an economically important mineral, but the prospector may use it as a guide to associated cobalt and native silver.

Erythrite occurs as a secondary mineral in the oxide zone of Co–Ni–As bearing mineral deposits. It occurs in association with cobaltite, skutterudite, symplesite, roselite-beta, scorodite, pharmacosiderite, adamite, morenosite, retgersite, and malachite.

Notable localities are Cobalt, Ontario; La Cobaltera, Chile, Schneeberg, Saxony, Germany; Joachimsthal, Czech Republic; Cornwall, England; Bou Azzer, Morocco; the Blackbird mine, Lemhi County, Idaho; Sara Alicia mine, near Alamos, Sonora, Mexico; Mt. Cobalt, Queensland and the Dome Rock copper mine, Mingary, South Australia.

==Other varieties==
The nickel variety, annabergite, occurs as a light green &quot;nickel bloom&quot; on nickel arsenides. In addition iron, magnesium and zinc can also substitute for the cobalt position, creating three other minerals: parasymplesite (Fe), hörnesite (Mg) and köttigite (Zn).

<doc id="1005429" wikidata="Q7275765" url="?curid=1005429" title="RAM press">
<text>A RAM press (or ram press) is a machine, invented in the USA in the mid-1940s, that is used to press clay into moulded shapes, such as plates and bowls. In operation a slice of de-aired clay body is placed in between two shaped porous moulds, and vertical movement of the moulds presses the body into the required shape.

==History==
The RAM process was devised around 1945 by the ceramics engineers Andrew Reif Blackburn and Richard E. Steele. The first RAM Press was made by Harold Dawson in Columbus, Ohio.
Blackburn and Steele sold their company to the Wallace Murray Corp. RAM Products Inc. of Columbus, Ohio was set up in 1979 and now manufactures the RAM press, as do other companies. In 1986, RAM Products introduced the 15-ton cub press for use by studio potters.

==Principle of operation==

In operation a slice of de-aired clay body is placed in between two shaped porous moulds or dies, and vertical movement of the moulds presses the body into the required shape. Pressing causes some water to be forced out of the clay body into the porous die, which stiffens the clay body allowing it to retain its shape. The dies used for RAM pressing are porous and have embedded air channels which allow pressurized air to be forced through the permeable die material to separate the pressed ceramic ware from the die. After pressing, air is forced through the bottom die as the press is opened. This causes the part to be released from the bottom die while adhering to the top die. Once the die is fully open, air is forced through the top die which releases the part onto a tray or into the operator’s hands. Dies are typically made from high strength gypsum cement, but may also be made from porous ceramic.

==Other uses==

The phrase &quot;ram press&quot; (in lower case) commonly means the same thing; it is simply used for machines that press items by a mechanical ram, such as with a plunger, piston, force pump, or hydraulic ram.

<doc id="1005447" wikidata="Q984207" url="?curid=1005447" title="The Inspector Lynley Mysteries">
<text>The Inspector Lynley Mysteries is a British crime drama television series that aired on BBC One from 12 March 2001 to 1 June 2008, consisting of six series and 24 episodes. The protagonist, Detective Inspector Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Lynley, 8th Earl of Asherton (Nathaniel Parker), who is assigned to Scotland Yard, finds himself paired with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers (Sharon Small). In addition to the tensions involved in solving murder cases, the series is built on clashes of personality, gender and class: Lynley is a polished man and a peer of the realm, and Havers is an untidy woman from a working-class background.

In August 2007, the BBC announced its intention to stop production of &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot;. Fans of the series mounted a campaign to save it, with a petition and by contacting the BBC, but to no avail. All six series have since been released on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK.

All episodes from the first two series and two from the third are based on novels by the American writer Elizabeth George, though the plots and characters are often significantly altered. Initially adapted by Lizzie Mickery, later episodes are original stories for television based on her characters. The music for the series was composed by Robert Lockhart; later series were scored by Debbie Wiseman.

==Production==
The first episode (pilot), &quot;A Great Deliverance&quot;, was broadcast on 12 and 13 March 2001, becoming the only two-part episode throughout the series run. It was also based on the inaugural Inspector Lynley novel. The first full series began broadcasting on 8 April 2002, with the first episode based on and named after the third novel, &quot;Well-Schooled in Murder&quot;. The first eleven episodes were based on, and named after, the eleven Inspector Lynley novels published from 1988 to 2001, beginning with the inaugural novel &quot;A Great Deliverance&quot;, but subsequently departing from the print sequence. Nine more novels have since been published as of 2018, with a further volume due out in 2021.

==Filming==
Exterior shots of Lynley and Havers&#x27; base were filmed at the Bircham Dyson Bell solicitors offices on Broadway, central London. The first episode of series five was notable for being shot in Dungeness in Kent. In the first episode, Lynley drove a Peugeot 607; whereas in both series one and two he drove a Jensen Interceptor; and in later episodes a Bristol 410. Despite the frequently recurring remark in PBS &quot;Mystery!&quot; presenter Diana Rigg&#x27;s introductions to the series that Lynley &quot;is the one with the Bentley&quot;, he never drove a Bentley on TV. He does, however, drive one in the George novels. In the pilot episode, the character of Helen Clyde was played by Emma Fielding. She was later portrayed by Lesley Vickerage from series one to three (from series three she and Lynley had married and she was thus known as Helen Lynley) and by Catherine Russell in series five.

<text>Expert shopping or witness shopping or expert mining is the practice of finding an authority on a given subject whose professional opinion is skewed toward the answer that the searching party already prefers. In civil and criminal litigation, expert shopping occurs when, having received an unfavourable opinion from one expert, a litigant seeks opinions from one or more other experts, until he finds an expert whose opinion is favourable to his case. Expert shopping may result in a battle of the experts.

An expert witness can be paid to testify in favor of one side of the case. In this case, the expert witnesses on each side may have totally different opinions. This use is well-known use.

Certain news media have been accused of &quot;expert shopping&quot; in relation to their news reports.

==History==
Expert shopping in litigation began in the nineteenth century.

<text>:&quot;The name of this monastery translated as the &quot;Monastery of the Cross&quot;. For other monasteries named after the cross, see Monastery of the Cross (disambiguation).&quot;

Jvari Monastery () is a sixth-century Georgian Orthodox monastery near Mtskheta, eastern Georgia. Jvari is a rare case of an Early Medieval Georgian church that has survived to the present day almost unchanged. The church became the founder of its type, the Jvari type of church architecture, prevalent in Georgia and Armenia. Built atop of Jvari Mount (656 m a.s.l.), the monastery is an example of harmonious connection with the natural environment, characteristic to medieval Georgian architecture. Along with other historic structures of Mtskheta, the monastery was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.

== History ==
Jvari Monastery stands on the rocky mountaintop at the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers, overlooking the town of Mtskheta, which was formerly the capital of the Kingdom of Iberia.

According to traditional accounts, on this location in the early 4th century Saint Nino, a female evangelist credited with converting King Mirian III of Iberia to Christianity, erected a large wooden (or vine) cross on the site of a pagan temple. The cross was reportedly able to work miracles and therefore drew pilgrims from all over the Caucasus. A small church was erected over the remnants of the wooden cross in c.545 during the rule of Guaram I, and named the &quot;Small Church of Jvari&quot;, which can still be seen adjacent to the main church from the north.

The small church did not satisfy the needs of popular pilgrimage site, and the present building, or &quot;Great Church of Jvari&quot;, is generally held to have been built between 590 and 605 by Guaram&#x27;s son Erismtavari Stepanoz I. This is based on the Jvari inscriptions on its facade which mentions the principal builders of the church: Stephanos the patricius, Demetrius the hypatos, and Adarnase the hypatos. Professor Cyril Toumanoff disagrees with this view, identifying these individuals as Stepanoz II, Demetre (brother of Stepanoz I), and Adarnase II (son of Stepanoz II), respectively. Nino&#x27;s cross remained inside of the church, and its original postament can still be found here.

In 914, during the Sajid invasion of Georgia, the church was burned by Arabs, but it managed to survive with only minor repairments.

The importance of Jvari complex increased over time and attracted many pilgrims. In the late Middle Ages, the complex was fortified by a stone wall and gate, remnants of which still survive. During the Soviet period, the church was preserved as a national monument, but access was rendered difficult by tight security at a nearby military base. After the independence of Georgia, the building was restored to active religious use. Jvari was listed together with other monuments of Mtskheta in 1994 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

However, over the centuries the structures suffered damage from rain and wind erosion and inadequate maintenance. Jvari was listed in the 2004 World Monuments Watch list by the World Monuments Fund.

==Architecture==

Jvari is an example of a harmonic relationship between architecture and nature. The temple, which appears to be growing from the mountain, was built on a cliff. The western facade, strengthened by a controforse wall, nearly hangs over the precipice.

It has two entrances, from the north and from the south. The building has the shape of a cross, prolonged from east to west, with each arm ended by semicircular apses. The Jvari church is an early example of a &quot;four-apsed church with four niches&quot; domed tetraconch. Between the four apses are three-quarter cylindrical niches, which are open to the central space, and the transition from the square central bay to the base of the dome&#x27;s drum is effected through three rows of squinches, an architectural achievement of its time. The lower row is made of four larger squinches, the two upper of smaller squinches, and finally the row of 32 facets, holding the dome. Thus, the dome rests on the walls, not on pillars, like in later churches, creating a single, entire space, and illusion of large size, although the church is less than 25 m high. Presence of high transitionary niches between the main space and the four small rooms is another trick of the architect, who wanted to diminish the contrast between large and small spaces. The Jvari church had a great impact on the further development of Georgian architecture and served as a model for many other churches.
The leading element of the building, the dome, has an 8-faceted tholobate. Under the dome, near the center of the interior, stands a postament, surrounded by an octagon, important artistic addition, which was originally at the base of Nino&#x27;s cross, but now holds a new wooden cross. The four cylindrical niches between the apses lead to four rooms: two in the eastern part, the altar and the sacristy, and two in the western, prayer rooms for the ruler (northwestern) and for women (southwestern). A writing above the latter room tells that its construction was funded by unknown Timistia. It also has a flat relief with depiction of the Ascension of Christ. Internal walls were originally covered with ashlar, and later plastered and painted in frescos, little of which survived.

Varied bas-relief sculptures with Hellenistic and Sassanian influences decorate its external observable eastern and southern façades, some of which are accompanied by explanatory inscriptions in Georgian Asomtavruli script. The entrance tympanum on the southern façade is adorned with a relief of the Glorification of the Cross, the same façade also shows an Ascension of Christ, a rather prevalent theme in Early Christian art. The cross, which is a traditional Bolnisi cross, is held by two angels. Northern façade is closed by a small earlier built church, as well as the western, visible from afar, are not decorated. Each window on the eastern façade has a decorative knob. Each of the three facets of the eastern apsis has a bas-relief, depicting rulers and noblemen. The left shows Demetre, the brother of Stepanoz I. The central depicts Stepanoz I in front of the Christ, which is also explained on the writing. The right bas-relief has Adrnerse the Hypatos with his son and archangels Gabriel and Michael flying above, but the identity is unclear, and some connect it with Adarnase I or Adarnase II. Another bas-relief, with Stepanoz II in front of the Christ, is found on the southern apsis. Possibly, the church architect, a kneeling figure, is depicted on the southern facet of the tholobate.
The small Guaram&#x27;s church, quadrangular in general proportions, has a cross-shaped interior. It is connected to a portal from the north, with the entrance to the church here and from the south. The church walls are covered by well-processed blocks. The conch was covered in mosaic, but only a fragment remains. A decorated niche is meant for the katolikos of Georgia. The southern entrance is decorated by capitals with ornamental leaves. A portal also connects the two churches.

The monastery complex is surrounded by remnants of walls with towers. The entrance with the gate was from the east.

Uncertainty over, and debate about, the date of the church&#x27;s construction have assumed nationalist undertones in Georgia and Armenia. Each nation claims to have invented the &quot;four-apsed church with four niches&quot; form exhibited by Jvari.

== Threats ==
The monastery is currently under threat from erosion caused by acid rain and strong winds.

The 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet wrecked in this area. The site where the survivors camped was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970, under the title of Spanish Fleet Survivors and Salvors Camp Site. Today, the McLarty Treasure Museum (a part of the park) exhibits artifacts relating to the wreck.

The first attempt by settlers to open an inlet at Sebastian took place in 1872. It was orchestrated by David Peter Gibson. Although Gibson first dug a cut at Sebastian in 1872 he did not acquire title to the property where the digging took place until May, 1885. Gibson&#x27;s Cut, as his inlet was known then, appears as a feature in a United States Coast and Geodetic Survey map drawn in the winter of 1880-81. Mention of Gibson&#x27;s Cut appears in James Henshall&#x27;s 1881 tale &quot;Cruise of the Rambler&quot; when he relates how &quot;Sailing out of St. Sebastian River into Indian River, a break in the coastline opposite can be seen, which is the beginning of an attempt by settlers in the vicinity to cut an inlet to the sea.&quot; Since Henshall was only passing through there was no way he could know that the &quot;break in the coast line&quot; he saw wasn&#x27;t the &quot;beginning&quot; but the result of the effort to dig the cut from nearly a decade earlier.

In the July 28, 1886, edition of the &quot;Florida Star&quot;, letter writer G. W. Idner reports that talk was once again circulating about re-opening Gibson&#x27;s Cut. Idner names some of those who worked on the first cut as &quot;The Gibson and Houston boys ... and also Charley Creech and several others.&quot; Idner was an early settler of Tillman, now Palm Bay. He was also involved with Gibson&#x27;s first efforts to open a cut. Discussion about opening Gibson&#x27;s Cut in 1886 never amounted to anything more than just talk although a commonly held misconception has been that this was the year it was first dug.

When faced with foreclosure on the barrier island property that held his cut, he transferred title to his son, Quinn, but lost the property anyway.

At the time of D. P. Gibson&#x27;s first effort the barrier island was about wide at the cut site. It widened considerably over the years as efforts to open an inlet continued.

During the summer of 1891 the second attempt to open an Inlet at Sebastian took place. By that time the barrier island had grown to be wide at the cut site. This would indicate that several other efforts had been mounted since 1872 although no records of these attempts have yet been found. Some of the folks involved with the 1891 effort were &quot;Nesbitt...Harris and Williamson [of] Micco [along with] Knight, Gibson, Eason, Jacobs and Mitchell&quot; all of Sebastian. They formed the St. Sebastian Inlet Association but they never succeeded in opening the inlet although they spent considerable money and time on the project.

An 1892 article read as follows: &quot;Col. D. P. Gibson, the pioneer settler in this section, says he will cut an inlet through to the Atlantic, and as the distance is only about 120 yards, it will only take a short time to make this very valuable improvement, and it is the general opinion that Col. Gibson will make a success of it.&quot; There is no indication that any work actually went on at the cut site that year, or for the next five years for that matter.

In 1897 some winter residents of Brevard county made the third effort to open the inlet. It was the most ambitious so far. In that year The Roseland Inlet Corporation was formed to open an inlet to the sea at Gibson&#x27;s Cut. The Corporation&#x27;s Board of Directors included Alice P. Hudson, William W. Bissell, Henri J. Van Zelm, Harry Todd and Thomas S. Drake all of New Rochelle, New York. Bissell was a wealthy banker and all of the others were well-to-do friends and associates of his. Thomas S. Drake was a descendant of Sir Francis Drake. Harry Todd&#x27;s father was James W. Todd who was a member of the Board of Directors at Bissell&#x27;s bank. He purchased the entire Fleming Grant in 1892 for $5,050 ($ in 2024 dollars) when it was sold at a Sheriff&#x27;s sale for taxes owed. There were . He paid 25 cents an acre($ in 2024 dollars).

Todd broke the Fleming Grant up and sold tracts to his New Rochelle business acquaintances who then formed the Roseland Inlet Association. They saw the Inlet as an essential fixture for the drainage of their swampland and a convenient access to the Atlantic for their sailboats. Although the Roseland Inlet Corporation dug a partial cut across the island it was never completed.

The fourth attempt at opening Gibson&#x27;s Cut began in 1899. Called &quot;The Sebastian Inlet Association,&quot; it was organized at Eau Gallie, April 20, of that year &quot;for the purpose of raising funds to cut a canal from Indian River to the ocean at Gibson&#x27;s cut, opposite the Sebastian River,&quot; Although several thousand dollars were spent and work went on at the inlet well into 1900 this group&#x27;s efforts to open the Sebastian Inlet met with failure.

The fifth effort to open the inlet took place in 1901. A newspaper article read: &quot;Another attempt is to be made to open the inlet at Gibson&#x27;s cut.&quot; By Early October there had been enough rainfall to cause high water levels in the lagoon. High water in the lagoon was considered essential for opening the Inlet. Some locals went to work on the cut with shovels an explosive charge in an effort to try and open it.

By the start of the 20th century water quality in the entire Lagoon north of the narrows was diminishing. Algae blooms were killing the fish and the oysters population was disappearing.

History hasn&#x27;t recorded exactly who was behind the sixth effort to open an inlet to the sea at Sebastian. A newspaper report mentions a dredge and a completion date prior to October 13, 1905.

In the same issue another article declared &quot;The people in the vicinity of Sebastian succeeded yesterday in opening an inlet to the ocean, through the narrow peninsular opposite the mouth of the Sebastian river. Between 40 and 100 men have been engaged in the work all the week. The value of this inlet to the ocean to the people from the Narrows to Eau Gallie cannot be estimated in dollars and cents.&quot;

The following week&#x27;s paper stated that &quot;Water continues to run from the river to the ocean through the new inlet. There was apprehension that it would &quot;cave&quot; faster than the sand would be carried out.&quot; Their fear was well founded as the high sand banks at the cut site continually washed down into it. It wasn&#x27;t long before the Inlet again filled with sand.

By 1909 population increases and numerous drainage projects had further degraded the Lagoon&#x27;s water quality. Many residents saw the inlet as an answer to allow clean seawater in to flush out the filth. To accomplish this, funds were raised. The nearby success of Fort Pierce dredging encouraged the supporters. But it failed to raise sufficient support.

By 1914 the lagoon system was nearly a dead body of water. Some circulated a petition among their neighbors in the spring of 1914 asking for an appropriation of $1,200 to open the inlet. Over 100 names were gathered on the petition and a delegation of over 40 individuals from the South end of the county then presented it to the Brevard County Commissioner&#x27;s at their April 1914 meeting. Among the delegation of 40 who spoke in favor of the Inlet were Roy Couch and Edson B. Arnold. It is likely that both of these men were instrumental in putting the petition drive together. The County Commissioners promised to &quot;...give it their united attention, and look up the law on the matter...&quot;

Memories of all the previous expensive failures were still too fresh. Some felt that there was a greater need for good roads than there was for an inlet which would &quot;only benefit the fish business.&quot;

Hopes for an inlet were raised in 1914 when it became known that &quot;Congressman L&#x27;Engle introduced a bill appropriating $5,000 to make a survey of several places including Sebastian, to open an inlet to aid the fishing industry.
This reinforced the impression that inlet would benefit a select group while costing uninterested taxpayers money.

A lack of funds and essential permits required by the federal government prevented any actual work on the inlet from taking place during 1914.

By 1915 the Sebastian Inlet issue was a topic on which many county residents had developed an opinion. Residents in the northern portion of Brevard county were largely opposed. To dispose of their resistance some residents from the south Brevard tried to again split the county in thirds. These plans were submitted to the state legislature by some Brevardians who made an appearance at the capitol with petitions and maps detailing the split. Their plan saw Brevard carved into three counties which would have been named - from north to south - Brevard, Hudson and Indian River. Titusville would have remained Brevard&#x27;s county seat, Cocoa would have become the county seat for Hudson county, named in honor of the senator who was to sponsor the bill, and Melbourne was to be the county seat of Indian River county. This did not happen.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers objected to the idea of the Sebastian Inlet for several reasons. The chosen location presented the distinct possibility that once the cut was opened it would cause sand shoals to form in the Indian river and block the East Coast Canal. The Corps was obliged to maintain the East Coast Canal at that time and didn&#x27;t want the extra expense of dredging out new shoals. Additionally they disagreed with the idea that the inlet would be dug, as had the East Coast Canal, using private funds which they viewed as a precursor to failure. The Corps insisted that for them to approve such a plan a local tax district would have to be created to raise funds for the inlet&#x27;s maintenance so that federal tax money wouldn&#x27;t be needed.

Mainly because of the lack of a tax district the Corps continued to deny Inlet supporters their needed War Department permit all through 1915. The Inlet&#x27;s supporters wouldn&#x27;t take a &quot;no&quot; from the Army Corps and persisted with their efforts to be granted a permit to dig the Sebastian Inlet. They repeatedly petitioned the government and were granted several public hearings to discuss the inlet issue at greater length during that year.

Perhaps hoping to help persuade the Corps to grant a permit for digging to begin, Jessie Goode volunteered to grant an easement across her barrier island property for the new cut. If her offer had been accepted the inlet would have been called &quot;The Goode Sebastian Inlet&quot; in honor of her late husband.

Two things important to the Sebastian Inlet plans occurred in 1916. The Corps agreed to grant a permit for a private consortium to proceed with work on the Inlet if they could post a $20,000 indemnity bond to cover the cost of the Corps repairing the East Coast Canal should the Inlet cause shoals to form and a wealthy physician, Dr. Hughlett, from Cocoa was elected to the state senate. Hughlett had been a friend of Couch&#x27;s for some years and Couch knew his election meant that an ear sympathetic to the need for the Sebastian Inlet was in Tallahassee.

Several important events occurred in 1917 that concerned the Sebastian Inlet. One of these events was when Mrs. C. H. Holderman started another newspaper in Brevard county after selling the one she had published in Manatee county for some years. On March 22 the first edition of her new publication, the &quot;Cocoa Tribune&quot; hit the streets. Holderman was 1 of only 3 women in Florida who edited a newspaper at that time. She was an outspoken advocate of women&#x27;s suffrage and unafraid of taking a stand on other controversial subjects as well. She exhibited an unrestrained disdain for burdensome taxation and used the pages of her publication to relay her feelings on the subject to her readers. Holderman&#x27;s &quot;Cocoa Tribune&quot; came out every Thursday. In her 3rd edition, that of April 5, 1917 a large front page article appeared that openly called for the digging of several inlets along Brevard&#x27;s coastline, including one at Sebastian.

Couch&#x27;s lobbying, Holderman&#x27;s editorial support and that of other editors in the area led Florida&#x27;s legislature to draft, and pass, the Indian River Inlet Bill during its 1917 session. Known also as the Hughlett-Rodes inlet bill it called for a special election to let the voters in Brevard County decide whether or not to go ahead and allocate tax money for continued engineering studies of the inlet&#x27;s feasibility. The election was scheduled to be held on August 21, 1917.

Holderman&#x27;s support for the Sebastian Inlet waned once she became aware of its dismal history. Subsequent issues of the Cocoa Tribune carried only criticism of the bill and the Inlets that would result if the bill became law.
Most of the other newspaper editors in North Brevard also opposed the idea and let everyone know of their beliefs in no uncertain terms. Only one editor in the county&#x27;s northern reaches, W. B. Dobson of the Cocoa Star, was very much in favor of the bill. No doubt this was because he was to become one of the three commissioners on the board should the inlet district become reality. The other two commissioners were going to be Couch and A. B. Tull.

As the August election drew close the inlet bill was a hotter, and more frequently discussed topic than was the 1st World War. Sections 6 and 7 of the bill were found particularly objectionable because they seemed to give the commissioners unlimited power to increase taxes and condemn land. When the election was held the bill lost. The majority of voters against it were in the north end of Brevard county. The bill would have succeeded had it only been up to the voters in the south end of the county.

As discouraging as this defeat must have been for Couch, it didn&#x27;t keep him from continuing to push for the Sebastian Inlet. Fish were scarce and this scarcity combined with the food shortage caused by the War meant a lot of families in the Indian River area were going hungry.

On April 25, 1918, the Sebastian Inlet Association was created at a meeting held in Sebastian. Although it was a privately funded entity, its creation, and Roy&#x27;s perpetual lobbying, must have been good enough for the War Department because only 2 days later it finally granted a permit to dig the Sebastian Inlet. Stipulations listed on the permit included one demanding that if any shoaling should occur in the East Coast Canal as a result of the inlet the Association would have to remove the shoals. Even so, the permit still required a $10,000 bond be posted.

The seventh effort to open an inlet at Sebastian proceeded as rapidly as possible once the long awaited permit was granted.

There were several reasons to hurry and complete the project. Not only was it felt that high water in the Indian River was essential for the Inlet to be opened, but the War Department permit expired on December 31, 1918. High water levels usually were reached in late summer or early fall, only 5 or 6 months away.

An article that appeared in the May 1, 1918 issue of the Melbourne Times named the &quot;officers of the Sebastian Inlet Association [as]: President, R.O. Couch, Grant; Secretary, Carl Schlichtinger, St. Lucie County; and Treasurer, Allen Campbell, Roseland.

This same article declared that no public money would be used in the effort, but only a few weeks had passed before Ernest Svedelius appeared before the County Commissioners of Brevard and St. Lucie counties to request that each of these bodies contribute $1,000 toward the inlet. No funds were forthcoming from either.

Because of the lack of funds in the Associations account Couch took it upon himself to build a suction dredge at his marine ways in Grant. He also hired Charles W. Sembler to dredge out the cut.

No sooner was the inlet open in 1918 than it was again filled with sand and debris. There were a number of influential citizens in the area who were steadfastly opposed to opening the Sebastian Inlet. Among them were grove owners such as A. B. Michael of Orchid. Michael was opposed to it for several reasons. One, he saw opening an inlet to the ocean as something that would forever change the fragile ecology of the Indian River Lagoon. At that time it was almost a body of fresh water. He was also concerned that the influx of salt water would ruin the fresh water wells essential for his groves. Cattlemen on the mainland nearby also shared a fear that their fresh water wells would be ruined, but the most powerful opponent to the opening was by far Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Rail Road that feared salt water in the lagoon would mean teredoes in the pilings of their rail road trestles that crossed the areas fresh water rivers. At any rate, it wasn&#x27;t but a couple of days after the Sebastian Inlet was opened that someone organized several boatloads of men from the Narrows to Ft. Pierce into an Inlet destruction crew. One evening they loaded lanterns, shovels, saws, pick-axes, dynamite and chains, maybe even a mule or two, into boats and headed to the newly opened Sebastian Inlet. There they cut cabbage palms and any other tree they could find, dragged them into the cut and placed a lot of dynamite along the banks. Once the dynamite was set off it blew sand into the inlet sufficiently to plug it up.

Couch committed another dredge to the project and work continued through the winter, even past the December 31 expiration date of the permit. Before long word of the projects continuance past the permits expiration date reached the War Department and this agency was not amused. Every one of the Sebastian Inlet Association&#x27;s board members and the dredge crews found themselves threatened with arrest if the work wasn&#x27;t halted promptly. With the two dredges still at work Couch and some other influential citizens set out for Washington, D.C. where they approached Senator Duncan U. Fletcher and lobbied him to work on the War Department and obtain another permit.

After returning from Washington, Couch secured the able assistance of Capt. Robert Hardee and Frank Vickers and all three went to Tallahassee to push through a bill that was essentially identical to the failed Indian River Inlet Bill of the previous year. The biggest difference in the two was in the land area to be encompassed by the tax district. Because north Brevard county had defeated the previous bill it was left out and the districts boundaries encompassed only those precincts in Brevard and St. Lucie counties that had voted for the Indian River Inlet Bill. Couch, Hardee and Vickers stayed in Tallahassee until the bill was signed by Governor Catts.

The Sebastian Inlet Tax District came into being in 1919 after the new bill had been approved in an election and on August 31, 1920 this new agency was granted a permit to dig which would remain valid until December 31, 1923.

The Tax District&#x27;s first $100,000 bond issue was delayed by court injunctions brought by some wealthy property owners and the F.E.C. but not even that delay stopped work on the inlet. Within several years the bond issue was approved, the inlet was opened sometime in June 1923 and several months later the Sebastian Inlet Tax District obtained permission from the land owner (Milton Hardee) to dig the inlet. It has been a continual struggle of man against the elements ever since just to keep the inlet open.

In 1924, jetties made of coquina rock were completed. They only lasted until the first big storm though when big waves rolled almost all the rocks away. Eventually granite, a much denser rock than coquina, was used and the jetties became a permanent fixture.
Sebastian Inlet&#x27;s first public telephone booth was installed in 1961. Until that point, reporting an emergency on the beach required knocking on private homes and asking to use their telephone.

In 2010, unwanted lionfish were found to have invaded local waters. They are a threat to native species.

<doc id="1005480" wikidata="Q388467" url="?curid=1005480" title="Afro-Cubans">
<text>Afro-Cubans () or Black Cubans are Cubans of full or partial sub-Saharan African ancestry. The term &quot;Afro-Cuban&quot; can also refer to historical or cultural elements in Cuba associated with this community, and the combining of native African and other cultural elements found in Cuban society, such as race, religion, music, language, the arts and class culture.

==Demographics==

According to the 2002 national census that surveyed 11.2 million Cubans, 1 million or 11% of Cubans identified as Afro-Cuban or Black. Some 3 million identified as &quot;mulatto&quot; or &quot;mestizo&quot;, meaning of mixed race, primarily a combination of African and European. Thus more than 40% of the population on the island affirm some African ancestry.

The Cuban Revolution brought to power Fidel Castro, who promised a communist society without racism. His government promised equal opportunities for education, health care and work.

There has been much scholarly discussion about the demographic composition of the island. A study by the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami estimated the proportion of people as having some black ancestry is more likely about 62%. They note that complex attitudes toward racial identification, and the &quot;de facto&quot; racial hierarchy that has existed on the island, have influenced the lower figures of self-identification as black.

In Cuba, there are many terms to classify Afro-Cubans of varying portions of African descent, related to the historic Spanish &quot;casta&quot; system. In addition, in current society, classification may simply be made based on visible attributes; thus, a person who looks white is likely classified as white, especially if educated and middle class.

By contrast, in the contemporary United States, a 2010 Harvard study showed that the practice of hypodescent classification persists. That is, biracial persons are typically classified by others as belonging to the race or ethnicity with lower social status, even if their ancestry is majority European. They found that persons with up to 69% European ancestry and the remainder African or African-American were still being classified as &#x27;black&#x27;. 

A DNA study in 2014 estimated the genetic admixture of the population of Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American.

Although Afro-Cubans can be found throughout Cuba, they comprise a higher proportion of the population in Oriente Province in Eastern Cuba than in other parts of the island. As the major city, Havana has the largest population of Afro-Cubans of any city in Cuba.

In the 21st century, many native African immigrants have been going to Cuba, especially from Angola. Also, immigrants from Jamaica and Haiti have been settling in Cuba. Most of them settle in the eastern part of the island, due to its proximity to their home countries, and further contributing to the already high percentage of ethnic blacks on that side of the island.
The percentage of Afro-Cubans on the island increased after the 1959 Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, because there was mass migration from the island of the largely white (or ethnic European) Cuban professional class, who were subject to violence, takeovers and losing their businesses and property.

A small percentage of Afro-Cubans left Cuba, mostly for the United States (particularly Florida). They and their U.S.-born children are known variously as Afro-Cuban Americans, Cuban Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans. Relatively few Afro-Cubans resided in the nearby Spanish-speaking country of Dominican Republic and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.

The Minority Rights Group International says that &quot;An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution&quot;.

===Afro-Cuban descendants in Africa===
During the 17th century, ex-slaves from Cuba and Brazil were transported to Africa to work for colonists as indentured servants or workers. They were taken largely to present-day Nigeria, the home of the Yoruba cultures, and Spanish Guinea (present-day Equatorial Guinea) home of the Fang and Bubi cultures.

In the 19th century, the former slaves were taken to Africa under the &quot;Royal Orders of September 13, 1845&quot; (by way of voluntary arrangement). When there were an insufficient number of volunteers, the colonial government arranged a June 20, 1861, deportation from Cuba. In Spanish Guinea, the indentured servants became part of the &quot;Emancipados&quot;. In the area of present-day Nigeria, they were called &quot;Amaros&quot;. 
Although the indentured workers were nominally free to return to Cuba when their tenure was over, most settled in these countries, marrying into the local African indigenous tribes.

Angola has had more recent immigrant communities of Afro-Cubans, known as Amparos. They are descendants of Afro-Cuban soldiers who were transported to serve as military in the country in 1975 as a result of Cuban involvement in the Cold War. Cuba&#x27;s Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, deployed thousands of troops to the country during the Angolan Civil War to support a faction of society. As a result of this era, a small Spanish-speaking community formed in Angola of Afro-Cubans; they number about 100,000 persons.

===Haitian-Cubans===

Haitian Creole language and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of immigrants from Saint-Domingue at the start of the 19th century. This was a French colony on the island of Hispaniola. The violence associated with the final years of the 1791–1804 Haitian Revolution resulted in a wave of ethnic French settlers fleeing to Cuba, and often taking numerous African slaves with them. These refugees settled mainly in the east, and especially Guantánamo. There the French later introduced sugar cane cultivation, and constructed sugar refineries. They also developed coffee plantations for another important commodity crop.

By 1804, some 30,000 Frenchmen were living in Baracoa and Maisí, the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Afro-Haitians continued to emigrate to Cuba to work as &quot;braceros&quot; (Spanish for &quot;manual laborers&quot;) cutting cane in the fields and processing it during harvest. Their living and working conditions were not much better than under slavery. Although many workers had planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba.

For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify as such or speak Creole, which is based in French and African languages. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination among the majority Spanish speakers.

In the 21st century, classes in Haitian Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana, in an effort to preserve the traditional language of the Afro-Haitians. There is also a Creole-language radio program.

==Religion==

Afro-Cubans are predominantly Roman Catholic, with minorities of Protestant. Afro-Cuban religion can be broken down into three main currents: Santería, Palo Monte and include individuals of all origins. Santería is syncretized with Roman Catholicism.

==Music==

Since the mid-19th century, innovations within Cuban music have been attributed to the Afro-Cuban community. Genres such as son, conga, mambo and chachachá combined European influences with sub-Saharan African elements. Cuban music evolved markedly away from the traditional European model towards improvisational African traditions. Afro-Cuban musicians have taken pre-existing genres such as trova, country and rap and added their own realities of life in a socialist country and as black persons. Genres like Nueva Trova are seen as live representations of the revolution and have been affected by Afro-Cuban musicians like Pablo Milanes who included African spirituals in his early repertory. Music in Cuba is encouraged both as a scholarly exercise and a popular enjoyment. To Cubans, music and study of it are integral parts of the revolution. Audiences are proud of mixed ethnicity that makes up the music from the Afro-Cuban community, despite there being a boundary of distrust and uncertainty between Cubans and Afro-Cuban culture.

African music and Afro-Cuban music mutually exchanged rhythmic patterns, melodies, and cultural elements, creating a dynamic musical interchange. African artists, particularly those from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola fused Afro-Cuban musical influences with their traditions, crafting distinct sounds. The result was an array of genres popular in West and Central Africa namely Congolese rumba, soukous, mbalax, semba, kizomba, and highlife. 

Afro-Cuban music can be divided into religious and profane. Religious music includes the chants, rhythms and instruments used in rituals of the religious currents mentioned above. Profane music includes rumba, guaguancó, comparsa (carnival music) and lesser styles such as the tumba francesa. Virtually all Cuban music is influenced by African rhythms. Cuban popular music, and much of the art music, combines influences from Spain and Africa in ways unique to Cuba. For example &quot;son&quot; combines African instruments and playing styles with the meter and rhythm of Spanish poetic forms. While much of the music is performed in cut-time, artists typically use an array of time signatures like 6/8 for drumming beats. On the other hand, clave uses a polymetric 7/8 + 5/8 time signature.

Afro-Cuban arts emerged in the early 1960s with musicians spearheading an amateur movement bringing African-influenced drumming to the forefront of Cuban music. For example, Enrique Bonne&#x27;s drumming ensembles took inspiration from Cuban folklore, traditional trova, dance music, and American Jazz. Pello de Afrokan created a new dance rhythm called Mozambique that increased in popularity after his predominantly afro-Cuban folklore troupe performed in 1964. Afro-Cuban artists Mario Bauzá and Frank Grillo, known as Machito, were influential figures in shaping the Afro-Cuban community and its music. Bauzá, a trumpeter and composer, pioneered the fusion of Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz, giving rise to the Afro-Cuban jazz movement which gained considerable popularity in the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean in the mid 20th century.

Before the revolution, authorities considered Afro-Cuban religious music a lesser culture; religious drummers were persecuted and instruments were confiscated. After the revolution, Afro-Cuban music could be practiced more openly, but authorities were suspicious due to its relation to Afro-Cuban religions. The first revolutionary institution created for the performing &quot;national folklore&quot; (Afro-Cuban artistic traditions) was &quot;Conjunto Folklórico Nacional&quot;. Despite official institutional support from the Castro&#x27;s regime, Afro-Cuban music was treated mostly with ambivalence throughout the second half of the 20th century. Audiences looked down on traditional and religious Afro-Cuban music as primitive and anti-revolutionary, music educators continued pre-revolutionary indifference toward afro-Cuban folklore, and the religious nature of Afro-Cuban music led to criticisms of the government&#x27;s whitening and de-Africanization of the music. Religious concerts declined, musical instruments related to Santería were confiscated and destroyed, afro-Cuban celebrations were banned outright, and strict limits were placed on the quantity of religious music heard on the radio and television. These attitudes softened in the 1970s and 1980s as the afro-Cuban community began to fuse religious elements into their music. In the 1990s, Afro-Cuban music became a mainstay of Cuba&#x27;s tourism economy. Members of religious groups earned their living by performing and teaching ritual drumming, song, and dance, to tourists visiting the country.

Rap was adopted in 1999 and solidified with the rise of hip-hop group Orishas. Cuban hip-hop focused on criticism of the Cuban state and the global economic order, including racism, colonialism, imperialism, and global capitalism.

==Language==
Other cultural elements considered to be Afro-Cuban can be found in language (including syntax, vocabulary, and style of speech).

The Afro-Cuban religions all maintain some degree of use of African languages. Santería and Abakuá both have large parts of their liturgy in African languages (Lucumí and Ñañigo, respectively) while Palo uses a mixture of Spanish and Kikongo, known as Habla Congo.

==Racial consciousness==

According to anthropologists dispatched by the European Union, racism is entrenched in Cuba. Afro-Cubans are systematically excluded from positions in tourism-related jobs, where they could earn tips in hard currencies. According to the EU study, Afro-Cubans are relegated to poor housing, and African Cubans are excluded from managerial positions.

Enrique Patterson, an Afro-Cuban journalist and former University of Havana professor of Marxist philosophy, describes race as a &quot;social bomb&quot; and says that &quot;If the Cuban government were to permit Afro-Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall&quot;. Esteban Morales Domínguez, a professor at the University of Havana, says that &quot;The absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens ... the revolution&#x27;s social project&quot;. Carlos Moore, who has written extensively on the issue, says that &quot;There is an unstated threat, Afro-cubans in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead. [...] The government is frightened to the extent to which it does not understand African Cubans today. You have a new generation of Afro-Cubans who are looking at politics in another way.&quot; Barack Obama&#x27;s victory has raised disturbing questions about the institutional racism in Cuba. &quot;The Economist&quot; noted &quot;The danger starts with his example: after all, a young, Afro-cuban, progressive politician has no chance of reaching the highest office in Cuba, although a majority of the island&#x27;s people are of mostly African descent&quot;

In the years between the triumph of the revolution and the victory at Playa Girón the Cuban government was one of the world&#x27;s most proactive regimes in the fight against discrimination. It achieved significant gains in racial equality through a series of egalitarian reforms early in the 1960s. Fidel Castro&#x27;s first public address on racism after his rise to power was on March 23, 1959, at a labor rally in Havana, less than three months after he defeated Fulgencio Batista. He is quoted as saying: &quot;One of the most just battles that must be fought, a battle that must be emphasized more and more, which I might call the fourth battlethe battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. I repeat: the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. Of all the forms of racial discrimination the worst is the one that limits the colored Cuban&#x27;s access to jobs. &quot; Castro pointed to the distinction between social segregation and employment, while placing great emphasis on correcting the latter. In response to the large amount of racism that existed in the job market, Castro issued anti-discrimination laws. In addition, he attempted to close the class gap between wealthy white Cubans and Afro-Cubans with a massive literacy campaign among other egalitarian reforms in the early and mid-1960s.
Two years after his 1959 speech at the Havana Labor Rally, Castro declared that the age of racism and discrimination was over. In a speech given at the Confederation of Cuban Workers in observance of May Day, Castro declared that the &quot;just laws of the revolution ended unemployment, put an end to villages without hospitals and schools, enacted laws which ended discrimination, control by monopolies, humiliation, and the suffering of the people.&quot; Although inspiring, many would consider the claim to be premature.&quot;

Research conducted by Yesilernis Peña, Jim Sidanius and Mark Sawyer in 2003, suggests that social discrimination is still prevalent, despite the low levels of economic discrimination.
After considering the issue solved, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism. His message marked a shift in Cuban society&#x27;s perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus.&quot; The government&#x27;s announcement easily allowed the Cuban public to deny discrimination without first correcting the stereotypes that remained in the minds of those who grew up in a Cuba that was racially and economically divided. Many who argue that racism does not exist in Cuba base their claims on the idea of Latin American Exceptionalism. According to the argument of Latin American Exceptionality, a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latina America. The large mestizo populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to Latin America are often linked to racial democracy. For many Cubans this translates into an argument of &quot;racial harmony&quot;, often referred to as racial democracy. In the case of Cuba, ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony.

In spite of all the promises and speeches by government leaders, racial discrimination against Afro-Cubans continues to be a major Human Rights issue for the Cuban government, even resulting in riots in Central Havana, a mostly black neighborhood in the capital.

Most of the Latin population of Tampa in the 1950s was working class and lived in restricted areas, ethnic enclaves in the vicinity of Tampa&#x27;s hundreds of cigar factories. African Cubans were tolerated to an extent in the Latin quarter (where most neighborhoods and cigar factories were integrated). Ybor City and its counterpart, West Tampa, were areas that bordered on other restricted sections-areas for U.S. blacks or whites only. In this Latin quarter, there existed racial discrimination despite its subtleness.

==Afrocubanismo==

During the 1920s and 1930s Cuba experienced a movement geared towards Afro-Cuban culture called Afrocubanismo. The movement had a large impact on Cuban literature, poetry, painting, music, and sculpture. It was the first artistic campaign in Cuba that focused on one particular theme: African culture. Specifically it highlighted the struggle for independence from Spain, African slavery, and building a purely Cuban national identity. Its goal was to incorporate African folklore and rhythm into traditional modes of art.

===History of the movement===
The movement evolved from an interest in the rediscovery of African heritage. It developed in two very different and parallel stages. One stage stemmed from European artists and intellectuals who were interested in African art and musical folk forms. This stage paralleled the Harlem Renaissance in New York, Négritude in the French Caribbean, and coincided with stylistic European Vanguard (like Cubism and its representation of African masks). It was characterized by the participation of white intellectuals such as Cubans Alejo Carpentier, Rómulo Lachatañeré, Fortunato Vizcarrondo, Fernando Ortiz and Lydia Cabrera, Puerto Rican Luis Palés Matos and Spaniards Pablo Picasso and Roger de Lauria. The African-inspired art tended to represent Afro-Cubans with cliché images such as a black man sitting beneath a palm tree with a cigar.

Poems and essays by Afro-Cuban writers began to be published in the 1930s in newspapers, magazines and books, where they discussed their own personal heritage. Afro-Cuban and Afro-Cuban heritage artists such as Nicolás Guillén, Alberto Arredondo and Emilio Ballagas brought light to the once-marginalized African race and culture. It became a symbol of empowerment and individuality for Afro-Cubans within the established Western culture of the Americas.

This empowerment became a catalyst for the second stage to be characterized by Afro-Cuban artists making art that truly reflected what it meant to be Afro-Cuban. Beginning in the 1930s this stage depicted a more serious view of black culture like African religions and the struggles associated with slavery. The main protagonist during this stage of the movement was Nicolás Guillén.

===Results of the movement===
The lasting reputation of the Afrocubanismo movement was the establishment of a New World art form that used aesthetics from both European and African culture. Although the actual movement of Afrocubanismo faded by the early 1940s, Afro-Cuban culture continues to play a vital role in the identity of Cuba. It has been the Cuban Revolution that opened up a space for extended research of African ethnic roots in Cuba. The rhetoric of the Revolution incorporates black history and its contribution as an important stratum of Cuban identity. The Revolution has funded many projects that restore the work of Afro-Cubans in an effort to accommodate an African-driven identity within the new anti-racist Cuban society.

<text>Zugdidi (; or ზუგიდი) is a city in the western Georgian historical province of Samegrelo (Mingrelia). It is situated in the north-west of that province. The city is located 318 kilometres west of Tbilisi, 30 km from the Black Sea coast and 30 km from the Egrisi Range, at an elevation of 100–110 metres above sea level. Zugdidi is the capital of the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region, which combines Samegrelo (Mingrelia) and upper part of Svaneti, and the centre of the Zugdidi Municipality within. Zugdidi is the sixth most populous city in Georgia.

The name &quot;Zugdidi&quot; (ზუგდიდი) first appeared in the 17th century. Literally it means &quot;big hill&quot; in the Mingrelian language (from , &#x27;hill&#x27;; &#x27;big&#x27;). An alternative version of the name recorded in old sources is &quot;Zubdidi&quot; (ზუბდიდი) with the same meaning as Megrelian. Local Georgian (Megrelian) residents of the historical provinces of Megrelia and Abkhazia also use &quot;Zugidi&quot; (ზუგიდი), which is a shortened form. The name was given to the town because of a hill situated in the eastern part of the city, where some small remains of an ancient fortress are still visible.

==History==
Historically Zugdidi was the capital of the Principality of Mingrelia (Odishi) until 1867 when the principality was abolished by the Russian Empire. After that Zugdidi was an administrative centre of Zugdidi Uyezd as a part of the Kutais Governorate until 1918 when it became a part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. From 1930 the centre of the Zugdidi Raion of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and then Independent Georgia (from 1991). 
Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Zugdidi was one of the important political and cultural centres of Mingrelia and the whole of Georgia. A famous Georgian medieval epic poem The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin has been rewritten by Mamuka Tavakalashvili here at the court of Prince Levan II Dadiani in 1646.

During the Crimean War (1853–1856) Ottoman forces with Omar Pasha seized Zugdidi in 1855. At the end of the 1855 and beginning of 1856 city was liberated by the Mingrelian Militia commanded by Major General Prince Grigol Dadiani. By the order of Iskender Pasha, Ottomans plundered, burnt and destroyed the whole city, especially palaces and botanical garden. During the Russian Empire, the city was the administrative center of the Zugdidi Uyezd of the Kutaisi Governorate. Many buildings were heavily damaged during the Georgian Civil War 1992–1993 as well.

Historically Zugdidi is known as a distinctly mono-ethnic city with a vast majority of Georgians. By the 2002 state census, 98.97% (166,039) of its total population (167,760) were ethnic Georgians (for both city and municipality).

In the second half of the 1850s, due to the short Ottoman occupation, the town population decreased from 2000 to 800.

The 1950s-1970s were an important period for Zugdidi&#x27;s development, which affected the growth of the population, while the last 20-year growth was mainly caused by refugee displacement. After the Russian-Georgian war in Abkhazia (1992-1993) a large number of internally displaced peoples from Abkhazia were forced to move to Zugdidi. As a result of this, according to the 2002 state census, Zugdidi became the fifth most populous city in Georgia, ahead of Sokhumi, Poti, and Gori. As of the 2014 national census, the population of Zugdidi decreased to 42,998 inhabitants, making it Georgia&#x27;s sixth most populous city after Gori.

<text>Anthony John Green (29 January 1939 – 4 March 2024) was an English sports commentator and television presenter, best known as the scorer and later co-host of the British TV show &quot;Bullseye&quot;, from 1982 to 1995 and again in 2006 &amp; 2007.

Green was also the commentator for the annual BDO World Darts Championships from 1978 to 2016.

== Broadcasting career ==
Green (alongside) Sid Waddell, were the darts commentators on the BBC from 1978 to 1994. Waddell left the BBC in 1994, whilst Green remained until the 2016 BDO World Darts Championships, (this being Green&#x27;s final appearance ), and the last one televised by the BBC. In 1990, Green was commentating during the first ever nine-dart finish at the BDO World Darts Championship. In the second round, Paul Lim netted £52,000 by hitting 180 twice, finishing with treble 20, treble 19, then double 12, to the delight of Green, commentating for the BBC. 

In 2000, he appeared as himself in all six episodes on the talk show Meet Ricky Gervais broadcast on Channel 4. Green was well known as the announcer and co-host, alongside Jim Bowen, of the popular television darts quiz &quot;Bullseye&quot;, produced by Central for ITV from 1982 to 1995. In 2006, a reprised version of the show was aired, which was produced by Granada Productions for Challenge, and hosted by comedian Dave Spikey. 

Green reprised his role of &#x27;scorer&#x27; on a special edition of Bullseye, which aired as part of the Gameshow Marathon series and was broadcast on ITV on 19 May 2007. On 18 and 19 May 2007, Green co-hosted Challenge TV&#x27;s coverage of the inaugural PDC US Open tournament.

In 2015, Green was narrator and commentator for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Darts for Comic Relief&quot;.

== Illness and death ==
In 2010, Green took a career break while being successfully treated for tongue cancer.

After developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Green died on 4 March 2024, at the age of 85. His last ever commentary came in the 2022 Darts World Seniors Masters quarter-finals, where Phil Taylor beat Les Wallace.

<doc id="1005525" wikidata="Q6193763" url="?curid=1005525" title="Jim Bowen">
<text>James Brown Whittaker (born Peter Williams; 20 August 1937 – 14 March 2018), known professionally as Jim Bowen, was an English stand-up comedian, actor and television personality. He was the long-time host of the ITV game show &quot;Bullseye&quot;, which he presented from its beginning in 1981 through to the end of its original run in 1995.

In early adulthood, Bowen was a teacher and took part in local dramatic groups. He first appeared on television in &quot;The Comedians&quot; (1971) and he eventually devoted himself to comedy full-time, appearing in other television shows in the 1970s. After the popular &quot;Bullseye&quot;, he subsequently worked for various radio stations and toured with stand-up shows. Towards the end of his life he was affected by a number of strokes. 

==Early life==
Bowen was born in Heswall, Wirral, Cheshire, to an unmarried mother and was adopted at nine months from an orphanage in Wirral, by a working-class couple, Joe Whittaker, a World War I veteran, and his wife, Annie Whittaker, who were both from Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire. He grew up in Clayton-le-Moors, just outside Accrington, where Joe was a bricklayer for Accrington&#x27;s Nori brick factory and Annie worked as a weaver at Atlas Street Mill. He was educated at Accrington Grammar School, but failed all but one of his O-levels and subsequently worked as a dustman in Burnley. He later changed his name to James Whittaker.

During his National Service, Bowen served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps from 1955 to 1957 as an ammunition inspector with the rank of Corporal. After making a serious error during the Suez Crisis, when he sent the wrong batch of ammunition to Barry Docks, he was sent on a Physical Training course in Aldershot to become an instructor, and later became a school Physical Education teacher specialising in gymnastics. He studied at Chester Diocesan Training College, eventually becoming a deputy headmaster of Caton Primary School near Lancaster.

==Television==
While teaching, Bowen became involved with the local dramatic society which kindled his interest in show business. In the 1960s, he worked part-time as a stand-up comedian on the northern club circuit, balancing his comedy career with his day job as a teacher. After having become disillusioned with his teaching career, he was inspired to take up comedy full-time, after seeing Ken Dodd perform a well-received show in front of 3,500 in Blackpool. He took his stage name from his wife&#x27;s maiden name, Owen, adding the initial of his mother&#x27;s, Brown. The advent of Granada TV’s &quot;The Comedians&quot; in 1971 gave him the opportunity to appear on national television, which ultimately helped persuade him to become a full-time entertainer.

Television opportunities followed, and he made appearances in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; as a library attendant, and on Granada&#x27;s &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;. He also starred alongside Ray Burdis, John Blundell, Pauline Quirke and the pop group Flintlock in two series of Thames Television&#x27;s children&#x27;s sketch show &quot;You Must Be Joking&quot; in 1975 and 1976.

Bowen also appeared in TV dramas and comedies. In 1981 he played &quot;Dad&quot; in the Victoria Wood television play &quot;Happy Since I Met You&quot;. He played a crooked accountant in ITV&#x27;s 1982 mini-series &quot;Muck and Brass&quot;, and later guest-starred in BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, playing the hotel owner Frank &quot;Hoss&quot; Cartwright. He subsequently appeared in Peter Kay&#x27;s 2005 Comic Relief video for &quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo&quot;?

His last television appearance was in an interview about the game show &quot;Bullseye&quot;, recorded a few weeks before his death, for the Matthew Kelly clips and countdown show &quot;Top Of the Box 1985&quot;, repeated on Channel 5 as &quot;Greatest TV Moments of the 80s&quot; in 2023.

===&quot;Bullseye&quot;===
In 1981, Bowen became the presenter of a new ITV game show, &quot;Bullseye&quot;, which mixed general knowledge questions with darts. The show quickly became a popular feature of ITV&#x27;s schedules on Sunday early evenings, achieving 15–20 million viewers and at times obtaining higher ratings than prime-time soap operas. It ran for fourteen years. On the back of his fame, he delivered several speeches at the Oxford Union.

Bowen was the presenter throughout, along with Tony Green as the darts commentator, and several of the catchphrases he used on the programme became well-known (though he claimed never to have said &quot;Super, smashing, great&quot;). He would warn contestants that if they gambled and lost, all they would receive was their &quot;BFH: Bus Fare Home&quot;. &quot;Keep out of the black and in the red; nothing in this game for two in a bed&quot; referred to how contestants would win a prize by hitting the appropriate part of the dartboard, but would lose the prize if they hit it twice. He always asked contestants who lost the gamble to &quot;look at what you could have won&quot;.

==Radio and stage==

In 1999, Bowen began presenting on BBC Radio Lancashire but in 2002, after working there for three years, he resigned after referring to a guest on his show as a &quot;nig-nog&quot;. He apologised for the remark almost immediately, and afterwards stated &quot;No racial connotation was ever intended&quot;. On 27 August 2012, Bowen reunited with &quot;Happy Daft Farm&quot; co-presenter Sally Naden for a one-off show on the station.

Bowen returned to radio in 2009, presenting a mid-morning radio show on 106.6 Indigo FM in Cumbria.

In 2005, Bowen performed a solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe about &quot;Bullseye&quot;, called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat a Bit of Bully&quot;. He returned to Edinburgh in 2006 performing at Jongleurs from 8–28 August.

==Personal life==
In 1959, Bowen married his colleague, Phyllis (née Owen). She supported him throughout his career, driving him to shows, and was by his bedside when he died. The couple lived at Melling-with-Wrayton near Lancaster.

They had two children. Bowen was a supporter of Blackburn Rovers Football Club.

Jim was instantly recognised in both his home area and when travelling to venues with the Personalised Number Plates J80 WEN which adorned several of his cars until he sold it in 2016.

Bowen previously owned Arkholme for Kirkby Lonsdale railway station, on what is now the Leeds–Morecambe line between and stations. He converted the main station building into a private dwelling.

==Health problems and death==
In early 2011, it was announced that Bowen was recovering in the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, after having suffered two mild strokes. He had suffered the first stroke on 18 February and the second whilst in hospital. Before his two strokes, Bowen performed on cruise liners and gave corporate after-dinner speeches. By 2012, he was recovering and regaining some mobility once more, and even started performing his stage show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat a Bit of Bully&quot;, but suffered a third stroke in November 2014, which left him struggling to walk and talk. He died at Royal Lancaster Hospital on 14 March 2018, aged 80.

<text>The Volksraad of the South African Republic (English: &quot;People&#x27;s Council&quot; of the South African Republic, ) was the parliament of the former South African Republic (ZAR), it existed from 1840 to 1877, and from 1881 to 1902 in part of what is now South Africa. The body ceased to exist after the British Empire&#x27;s victory in the Second Anglo-Boer War. The &quot;Volksraad&quot; sat in session in Ou Raadsaal in Church Square, Pretoria.

== Unicameral body ==
In 1840, at the beginning of the Natalia Republic, an adjunct &quot;Volksraad&quot; was created in Potchefstroom for settlers west of the Drakensberg. The Potchefstroom &quot;Volksraad&quot; continued despite the British annexation of the Natalia Republic in 1843. It eventually passed the Thirty-three Articles, the precursor to the 1858 constitution (&quot;Grondwet&quot;), in 1849. In 1858 the &quot;Grondwet&quot; permanently established the &quot;Volksraad&quot; as the supreme authority of the nation. 

Volksraad was initially a unicameral body. It consisted of three members for each of the districts of Potchefstroom, Lydenburg, Rustenburg, Zoutpansberg, Pretoria, Wakkerstroom, Utrecht, Middelburg, Heidelberg, Waterberg, Marico, and Bloemhof, and one member for each of the towns of Potchefstroom, Lydenburg, Rustenburg, and Pretoria. 
The members had to be of European origin, over thirty years old, possessed real estate, never convicted of crime, member of a Protestant church, and voters in the Republic of at least three years. 

Before 1873 the members were elected for two years, and half of the members retired every two years. The Volksraad met once a year in ordinary session. 

== Bicameral body ==

Initially a unicameral body, the &quot;Volksraad&quot; was divided into two chambers in 1890 in order to keep Boer control over state matters while still giving &quot;Uitlanders&quot; (foreigners) — many of whom were temporarily employed in the mining industry — a say in local affairs, in order to fend off British complaints.

From 1890 the &quot;Volksraad&quot; consisted of two houses of 24 members each. The &quot;Second &quot;Volksraad&quot;&quot; had suffrage for all white males above 16 years, and had limited legislative powers in the fields of mining, road construction, copyright and certain commercial affairs, all subject to ratification by the &quot;First &quot;Volksraad&quot;&quot;. This was the highest authority in charge of state policy, with preference being given to fully franchised burghers for appointment to government posts.

The members of the First Volkraad were elected for four years. First Volksraad members had to be born in the state. 

The Second Volksraad, of the Uitlanders, was allegedly without power.

<text>The Tibetan Spaniel is a breed of assertive, small dogs originating in Tibet. This breed is not a spaniel in the original meaning of the term; its breeding differs from other spaniels, and unlike true spaniels, which are gun dogs, the Tibetan spaniel is a companion dog. The spaniel name may have been given due to its resemblance to the bred-down lapdog versions of the hunting spaniels, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

== Description ==
=== Appearance===

The Tibetan Spaniel has a domed head that is small in comparison to its body. It has a short blunt muzzle, free of wrinkles. Its teeth occlude in either an underbite or an end-to-end bite. The nose is black. The eyes are medium in size, set wide apart, and oval in shape. The Tibetan Spaniel does not have extra skin around the eyes; this helps to distinguish the breed from the Pekingese. The ears hang down either side of the head to cheek level and are feathered with a v shape. The neck is covered in a mane of hair, which is more noticeable in the male of the breed. The Tibetan Spaniel&#x27;s front legs are a little bowed and the feet are &quot;hare-like&quot;. This dog has a great feathered tail that is set high and is carried over its back. The coat is a silky double coat lying flat and is short and smooth on the face and leg fronts; it is medium in length on the body, and has feathering on the ears, toes and tail.

Tibetan Spaniels come in all colours and can be solid, shaded and multi-coloured. Colours that are seen are red, fawn, gold, white, cream, black and tan, and parti. Often there are white markings on the feet. 
By AKC breed standard, this breed grows to about at the shoulder, and the weight is . Slightly larger Tibetan Spaniels can often be found outside the show ring.

=== Temperament===
Tibetan Spaniels are a social breed that needs regular contact with their humans. They do not respond well to being left alone for long periods of time. Having been developed as a companion dog by Tibetan monks they are emotional and empathetic to the needs of their owners.

It is important to socialize Tibetan Spaniels at an early age to a variety of people and situations. They are protective of their family. Even after socialization, they are typically aloof with strangers. If startled or uneasy, a Tibetan Spaniel will express their distrust with loud alarm barking. 
While utterly devoted to their family members, Tibetan Spaniels are fiercely independent and stubborn, with a tendency to wander off and explore rather than come when called. This quality—assertive, independent, and alert—is the standard temperament required by both the AKC and FCI breed standards.

==History==
===Tibet===
Small monastery dogs, thought to be early representatives of the Tibetan Spaniel, loyally trailed behind their Lama masters and came to be regarded as &quot;Little Lions&quot; owing to their resemblance to the Snow Lions—a variation of the Chinese guardian lions—that gave them great value and prestige. The practice of sending the dogs as gifts to the palaces of China and other Buddhist countries grew significantly, and more &quot;lion dogs&quot; were presented back to Tibet, continuing until as late as 1908. As a result of exchanges of Tibetan Spaniels between palaces and monasteries, the breed is likely to have common ancestors with Oriental breeds such as the Japanese Chin and the Pekingese.

Not only was the Tibetan Spaniel prized as a pet and companion, but it was also a useful member of Tibetan monastic life. The little dogs would sit on the monastery walls, keeping watch over the countryside. Their keen eyesight and ability to see great distances made them excellent watchdogs. They would alarm bark to alert the monks and the Tibetan Mastiffs below. In addition to functioning as lookouts, the Tibetan Spaniels were trained to spin the monk&#x27;s prayer wheels. They also slept with the monks at night to provide warmth.

Village-bred Tibetan Spaniels varied greatly in size and type, and the smaller puppies were usually given as gifts to the monasteries. In turn, these smaller dogs used in the monastery breeding programs were probably combined with the more elegant Tibetan Spaniel-type dogs brought from China. Those bred closer to the Chinese borders were characterized by shorter snouts.

===Western World===
Tibetan Spaniels were being bred in the United Kingdom by the 1890s. The first authenticated reference we find to Tibetan Spaniels in the United States is a litter born out of two imported dogs from a Tibetan monastery in 1965. In January 1971, the Tibetan Spaniel Club of America was formed with 14 charter members. An open secondary registry was maintained. After a period in the Miscellaneous classes, the Tibetan Spaniel was accepted for AKC registration and became eligible to compete as a Non-Sporting breed, effective January 1, 1984. The breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1987 and placed in Group 9 Companion and Toy Dogs, Section 5 : Tibetan breeds.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 15.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

===Progressive retinal atrophy===

Progressive retinal atrophy is a genetic disease that can occur in the breed. The disease is an inherited form of blindness in dogs that has in two forms: generalized PRA and central PRA. Generalized PRA is primarily a photoreceptor disease and is the form found in Tibetan Spaniels. The clinical signs have been observed between 1½ and 4 years, but as late at seven years. The disease is painless and affected dogs become completely blind. Currently there is no treatment, but affected dogs generally adapt well to their progressive blindness.

The earliest clinical sign of progressive retinal atrophy is &quot;night blindness.&quot; The dog cannot see well in a dimly lit room or at dusk. The dog will show a reluctance to move from a lighted area into darker surroundings. The night blindness develops progressively into complete blindness. The British institution Animal Health Trust (AHT) devoted intensive research for PRA in Tibetan Spaniels, isolating the responsible gene. The mutation was identified by Louise Downs, as part of her PhD studies. A DNA test based on this mutation became available July 8, 2013.

Responsible breeders are working hard to eliminate PRA within the breed. Currently, the International Tibetan Spaniel Working Party collects health data including PRA history.

===Portosystemic shunt===

A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver, one of the body&#x27;s filters, so that it is not cleansed. This rare condition in Tibetan Spaniels is often referred to as a &quot;liver shunt&quot;.

Most shunts cause recognizable symptoms by the time a dog is a young adult but are occasionally diagnosed only later in life. Since the severity of the condition can vary widely depending on how much blood flow is diverted past the liver it is possible for a lot of variation in clinical signs and time of onset. Often, this condition is recognized after a puppy fails to grow, allowing early diagnosis. Signs of portosystemic shunts include poor weight gain, sensitivity to sedatives (especially diazepam), depression, pushing the head against a solid object, seizures, weakness, salivation, vomiting, poor appetite, increased drinking and urinating, balance problems and frequent urinary tract disease or early onset of bladder stones. A dramatic increase of these signs after eating is a strong supportive sign of a portosystemic shunt.

===Other issues===
Like many breeds of dog, Tibetan Spaniels are susceptible to allergies. They can also experience cherry eye, a d third eyelid. Additionally, the shape of a Tibetan Spaniel&#x27;s face makes it prone to a common cosmetic condition called weeping eye.

<doc id="1005592" wikidata="Q700105" url="?curid=1005592" title="Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn">
<text>Philip de Montmorency (ca. 1524 – 5 June 1568 in Brussels), also known as Count of Horn, &quot;Horne&quot;, &quot;Hoorne&quot; or &quot;Hoorn&quot;, was a victim of the Inquisition in the Spanish Netherlands.

==Biography==
De Montmorency was born as the eldest of four children of Josef van Montmorency, Count of Nevele and Anna van Egmont the Elder, who had married shortly after 26 August 1523, and lived at Ooidonk Castle. His father died early in 1530 in Bologna, Italy, where he was attending the coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. His mother remarried to Johan II, Count of Horn, one of the wealthiest nobles of the Netherlands, who, in 1540, left the County of Horne to his wife&#x27;s children on condition they assume his name. A page and later chamberlain at the court of Charles V, De Montmorency married Walburgis van Nieuwenaer in 1546. He became stadtholder of Guelders in 1555, an Admiral of Flanders and a knight of the Golden Fleece in 1556.

In 1559, De Montmorency commanded the stately fleet which conveyed Philip II from the Netherlands to Spain, and he remained at the Spanish court until 1563. On his return, he placed himself with the Prince of Orange and Count of Egmont at the head of the faction which opposed the imposition of the inquisition in the Netherlands by Cardinal Granvelle and ultimately forced his resignation. When Granvelle retired, the three nobles continued to resist the introduction of the Spanish Inquisition and of Spanish rule in the Netherlands. In April 1566, the Council of State sent Philip&#x27;s younger brother, Floris of Montmorency, to Spain in a last attempt to avoid war. However, Floris was arrested, kept under house arrest, and later secretly executed.

Although Philip II of Spain appeared to give way, he had made up his mind to punish the opponents of his policy. He replaced the regent, Margaret, duchess of Parma, with the duke of Alba, who entered the Netherlands at the head of a veteran army.

Orange fled from the country, but Egmont and Horn, despite his warning, decided to remain and face the storm. They were both seized, tried at the Council of Troubles and condemned as traitors. Ceaseless but vain efforts were made to obtain a fair trial for Horn, and appeals for clemency on his behalf were made by potentates in all parts of the continent. Egmont and Horn were beheaded on 5 June 1568 before the Town Hall on the Grand-Place/Grote Markt (Brussels&#x27; main square). Two years later, Philip II had Horn&#x27;s still-detained brother Floris strangled in secret and spread the rumor that he had died of disease.

==Legacy==
Today, a statue on the Square du Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavelsquare in Brussels commemorates the Counts of Egmont and Horn. In historical overview, they are usually mentioned together as &quot;Egmond en Hoorne&quot; and hailed as the first leaders of the Dutch revolt, as the predecessors of William of Orange, who grew to importance and obtained the rebel leadership after their execution.

Van Egmont (&quot;Egmond&quot;) and De Montmorency (&quot;Horn&quot; or &quot;Hoorn&quot;) both remained faithful Catholics and are commemorated in Belgium, with its traditional Catholic majority.

<text>Gloeocapsa (from the Greek &quot;gloia&quot; (gelatinous) and the Latin &quot;capsa&quot; (case)) is a genus of cyanobacteria. The cells secrete individual gelatinous sheaths which can often be seen as sheaths around recently divided cells within outer sheaths. Recently divided cell pairs often appear to be only one cell since the new cells cohere temporarily. They are also known as glow caps, a term derived from the yellowish hue given off by the cap.

==Occurrence==
Some species of this genus are halophiles and hence found in hypersaline lakes and other high salinity environments. An example of such occurrence of the genus is in the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. &quot;Gloeocapsa magma&quot; is noted for colonising roof shingles in the United States and Canada. Fossilized Gloeocapsa have been dated from as early as 1.5 billion years ago, found in the Ural mountains in Russia.

<doc id="1005595" wikidata="Q5333558" url="?curid=1005595" title="Economic vegetarianism">
<text>An economic vegetarian is a person who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint that the consumption of meat is expensive, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just because of necessity. In the developing world, where large numbers of poor people might not be averse to eating meat, they are regularly forced to not eat it, since meat can often be a luxury.

==Motivations==
Economic vegetarians believe that nutrition can be acquired more efficiently and at a lower price through vegetables, grains, etc., rather than from meat. They argue as health vegetarians that a vegetarian diet is rich in vitamins, dietary fiber, and complex carbohydrates, and carries with it fewer risks (such as heart disease, obesity, and bacterial infection) than consumption of by-products of animals. Consequently, they consider the production of meat economically unsound.

Some vegetarians are motivated by a lifestyle of simple living or adopt vegetarianism through necessity. For example, in the United Kingdom, necessity changed dietary habits during the period around World War II and the early 1950s, as animal products were strictly rationed and allotment or home-grown fruit and vegetables were readily available. Before that during World War I, Americans were encouraged to go one day of the week meatless in order to save meat rations for the troops, which began the &quot;Meatless Monday&quot; revolution. In developing countries people sometimes follow a mainly vegetarian diet simply because meat resources are scarce or expensive compared to alternative food sources. The same principle can also be a deciding factor in influencing the diet of low-income households in the Western world. The price of ground beef in the year 1985 was $1.28 per pound, and as of 2016 the price increased to $3.98 per pound, corresponding to a 39% increase in real terms over the last 31 years. The majority of the price increase has happened between 2004 and 2016, increasing by $1.72 over the 12-year period. These price increases make it hard for low-income households to continue to include meat as a part of their diet.

Many economic vegetarians also promote the idea that advanced agricultural techniques have made the production of meat outdated and inefficient. Some promote the idea of synthetic and cloned meat.

==Criticism==

==History==

In 1906, Albert Behne established the first post office and mail service. In 1924, he received the patent on the 47½ acres where the village presently exists. In 1930, at the age of 76, he platted the original Yellow Pine townsite.

Other original patentees were Oscar Ray Call, Behne&#x27;s former mining partner, and Henry Abstein.
Abstein, the first patentee in the area, homesteaded north and east of the present townsite. Although his primary interest was mining, he was also an active horticulturist and many of the apple trees that he planted are still living today. His original holdings have since been subdivided.

Yellow Pine is located east of McCall, via the Lick Creek road (open seasonally); from Cascade, via the Warm Lake and Johnson Creek Roads (open seasonally); and from Cascade via the Warm Lake and South Fork Roads (open year around).

==History==

Jönköping is an old trading centre (&quot;Köping&quot;) situated at a natural crossroads for routes following the rivers Nissan and Lagan, and the road connecting the provinces of Östergötland and Västergötland, a result of the town&#x27;s geographical position at the southern end of lake Vättern, which divides the two provinces.

On 18 May 1284 Jönköping became the first City in Sweden to be granted its rights by king Magnus Ladulås, who ruled mostly from Vättern&#x27;s largest island Visingsö. The first part of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Jön&quot;, is derived from a creek, &quot;Junebäcken&quot;, in Talavid, in what is now the western part of the city. The second part of the name &quot;köping&quot;, is, as mentioned above, an old word for a trading centre or market place.

The geographical position of the city also left it vulnerable to attack via the river routes that led south, mainly from Danes. At that time the provinces of what is today southern Sweden – Scania, Halland and Blekinge – belonged to Denmark. The city was plundered and burned several times until it was fortified during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Jönköping was known for its matchstick industry between 1845 and 1970. The phosphorus match was invented in 1831, and these matches became very popular because one could strike it against any surface to ignite it. However, the problem was that they ignited too easily, caused a lot of accidents and were toxic. In 1844, Swedish professor Gustav Erik Pasch patented a new invention, &quot;Safety matches – Strike against the box only&quot;. To prevent the matches from igniting so easily, Gustav Erik Pasch separated the chemicals in the match head and placed the phosphorus on a separate surface on the outside of the box for striking ignition. Johan Edvard and Carl Frans Lundström took Pasch&#x27;s patent and improved it. Later, they manufactured their new Safety matches in their factory in Jönköping. Today, the Match Museum is located in Jönköping&#x27;s first match factory.

==Present==
The urban area of Jönköping today includes the eastern industrial town of Huskvarna, with which it has grown together.

Elmia, a major trade fair and exhibition centre, is situated in Jönköping. Elmia Wood is the world&#x27;s largest forestry fair, and fairs for subcontractors, trucks, caravans and railways are the biggest of their kind in Europe. Since 2001, Elmia has been the site of the world&#x27;s largest LAN party, DreamHack, with two events every year, Dreamhack Summer and Dreamhack Winter.

The city is an important Nordic logistical center, with many companies&#x27; central warehouses (such as Elgiganten, IKEA, Electrolux and Husqvarna) situated there.

In late 2019, Jönköping was seen as the city with best future prospects in Sweden by WSP.

==Climate==
Jönköping&#x27;s climate was humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with long, cold winters and short, warm summers during the 1961–1990 period. However, the window between subarctic and oceanic is very small in this marine-influenced climate type, and in recent years the climate has more resembled very cold oceanic. However, figures are slightly skewed due to the weather station being located at the airport which is at an elevation of , whereas the city centre is at . This likely renders up to between half a degree to a full degree milder temperatures in the urban centre.

<text>Patrick D. &quot;Pat&quot; Martin (born December 13, 1955, in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian politician. He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015, representing the riding of Winnipeg Centre for the New Democratic Party.

==Career==
Martin graduated from Argyle High School in 1974. He worked as a journeyman carpenter for several years, and was employed in forest service, mines and construction. Martin also served as business manager of the Manitoba Carpenters Union from 1989 to 1997, and was vice-president of the Manitoba Federation of Labour for a time. He has been a member of the executive of the Manitoba Building Trades Council, and was part of the Winnipeg 2000 Economic Development Committee.

Martin was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1997 federal election, defeating Liberal incumbent David Walker by a margin of 10,979 votes to 9,895. Martin was re-elected in the 2000 federal election, defeating Liberal Kevin Lamoureux by 11,263 votes to 9,310. He increased his margin of victory in the 2004 election, defeating Liberal candidate David Northcott by about 3,000 votes.

He supported Bill Blaikie for the NDP leadership in 2002–03.

He called for Svend Robinson to be removed from the NDP&#x27;s foreign affairs portfolio in 2002, after Robinson&#x27;s controversial visit to the Palestinian Authority.

Martin is an outspoken critic of the Canadian monarchy, both in parliament and in the media, citing the marriage of the Prince of Wales to the Duchess of Cornwall as a reason to abolish the institution.

In his book, &quot;Speaking Out Louder: Ideas That Work For Canadians&quot;, Jack Layton, then the Leader of the NDP, thanked Martin and his wife for loaning their Saltspring Island farmhouse for secluded writing.&quot;

When Liberal leadership candidate Joe Volpe received donations totalling $108,000 from Apotex executives and their wives and children, Martin suggested that these donations had the appearance of fraud. He filed an official complaint on May 29, asking elections commissioner Raymond Landry to investigate whether an attempt had been made to circumvent the Elections Act which banned corporate donations. Volpe responded by promising to return any donations that contravened the letter or spirit of the law.

In June 2008, Martin introduced a motion into the House of Commons calling on the government to amend the royal arms of Canada to incorporate symbols representing Canada&#x27;s First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples.

Martin introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, C-248, in parliament to exonerate Louis Riel On May 5, 2011 at the Royal Ontario Museum Martin debated Tom Flanagan on the topic &quot;Louis Riel deserved to Hang&quot;. In a &quot;National Post&quot; article he argued that Riel was a hero, not a traitor and, in reference to George R. D. Goulet&#x27;s 1999 book on Riel, that Riel&#x27;s execution was a &quot;case of both justice and mercy denied&quot;.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranked him as runner up for best orator in parliament in 2011 behind John Baird.

On February 5, 2015, Martin stated that he would file a lawsuit against anyone who claimed he lived on Salt Spring Island. &quot;They&#x27;re going to get their asses sued,&quot; said Martin adding &quot;I know a thing or two about libel,&quot; referring to his issue with a defamation suit, which he settled for an undisclosed sum with an Edmonton telemarketer. Martin owns a hobby farm on Salt Spring Island that he bought with his former wife and currently resides in Osborne Village in the riding of Winnipeg South Centre. When asked about a Salt Spring community event calendar from the local NDP association inviting people to &quot;Come by and hear an Ottawa update from Salt Spring&#x27;s MP Pat Martin,&quot; by Winnipeg Free Press journalist Mia Rabson, Martin stated that the Riding Association President &quot;was being funny by calling him that.&quot;

Within a day of the writ drop for the 2015 federal election, Martin was endorsed by the United Fire Fighters of Winnipeg president Alex Forrest. Martin lost re-election in 2015.

==Controversy==

===Youth For Christ===

In 2010, while Youth For Christ was in the development stages of building a youth centre at the corner of Higgins and Main that would include a multi-sport gym, dance studio, fitness centre, skate-and-BMX park, drop-in centre, theatre, classroom, counselling facilities and a job-training centre, Martin stated that the social-service organization were &quot;evangelical fundamentalists&quot; who were &quot;preying on vulnerable kids&quot; and that the organization &quot;offering much-needed sports opportunities is just their way of luring in young prospects.&quot; Martin also stated that the Federal government and City of Winnipeg providing funding to the inner city development equated to &quot;taxpayer-funded proselytization.&quot; An article by the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; Editorial Board stated that if &quot;the MP believes [Youth For Christ] should not receive any taxpayer money because he faithfully believes the organization is trying to convert &quot;vulnerable, impressionable kids&quot; to fundamentalist Christian views. If the good parliamentarian has any evidence to support his allegations, he should produce it immediately, or withdraw his comments.&quot;
One week after criticising the organization and facing mounting criticism, Martin said he supported the development at Higgins and Main by stating that &quot;Anything happening in the inner city is better than nothing.&quot;

===Twitter===

On November 17, 2011, Martin was criticized for using profane language on his Twitter account expressing anger over the Conservative government&#x27;s use of closure in limiting debate in the House of Commons tweeting: &quot;This is a fucking disgrace&quot; and &quot;There’s not a democracy in the world that would tolerate this jackboot shit.&quot; He also used profane language to criticize those on Twitter that had challenged his use of profanity tweeting &quot;Fuck you&quot; to one Twitter user. Martin refused to apologize.
On December 20, 2012, Pat Martin tweeted: I&#x27;m not &#x27;worked up&#x27; so much as &#x27;fed up&#x27; with the rat faced whores in the [Conservative Party of Canada] who neglect to invite me to in my riding&quot; and &quot;Look...Given the parliamentary session we&#x27;ve just endured, the term &#x27;rat faced whores&#x27; is using a great deal of restraint...&quot; after not receiving an invitation to an event in his riding.

After a heated exchange, Martin swore off Twitter and tweeted &quot;I apologize for my regrettable and inappropriate language&quot;, and &quot;It seems some people shouldn’t tweet so with this, I sign off.&quot;
An NDP spokesperson confirmed Martin&#x27;s decision stating &quot;these comments were simply inappropriate and unacceptable,&quot; and that &quot;Mr. Martin agrees and we understand that he has decided to stop using his Twitter account.&quot;

===Defamation lawsuit and donations===

Upon revelations about the robocall scandal in February, Martin publicly accused Racknine of being behind the automated calls that saw voters misdirected to non-existent polling locations during the May 2011 federal election. Racknine filed a defamation lawsuit for $5 million in damages. Martin ended up settling the defamation lawsuit against him and publicly apologized and stated that Racknine was &quot;merely an innocent intermediary not a participant in electoral fraud&quot;.
Due to the costs awarded to Racknine, Martin received a loan from the NDP and accepted donations from unions to help fund his defamation suit and pay for the settlement. Documents filed with the federal ethics commissioner showed Martin accepted contributions to a legal defence fund from the Canadian Labour Congress, the United Steelworkers and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and 14 other unions or locals.

Duff Conacher, founder of Democracy Watch, asked Martin to disclose the exact amount each of the two dozen organizations has donated to the trust fund set up to pay off his legal bill. &quot;You&#x27;re not allowed to be in the appearance of a conflict of interest, even if the gift does not change your mind from what you already believed. You can&#x27;t have it. If you have that, you don&#x27;t have democracy. You have a system of where the dollar wins and that&#x27;s not democracy,&quot; said Conacher. Martin said it would be &quot;ludicrous&quot; to think the donations would influence his position on labour issues saying that &quot;If anybody thinks I could become more friendly to trade unions, then they don’t know me very well,&quot; adding &quot;I’m a socialist and trade unionist and former head of the carpenters’ union in Manitoba.&quot; In two instances, the ethics commissioner directed Martin to return more than $20,000 involving donations from two unions that he had dealings with as an MP.

===Underwear comments in House of Commons===
After standing in the House of Commons during a procedural vote, which is against protocol, Martin said that his tight underwear required him to stand. The comments trended across Twitter and made international headlines including CNN’s Ridiculist. Martin later admitted that the story was fabricated.

===Comments during 2015 federal election===
During the 2015 Canadian federal election, Martin called Don Woodstock, the Green Party candidate, a &quot;son of a bitch&quot; and at a later time was caught calling him a &quot;fucking prick&quot; during a debate on issues affecting downtown Winnipeg in which Woodstock questioned Martin&#x27;s record on mental health issues. Martin also called Robert-Falcon Ouellette, the Liberal candidate, &quot;full of shit&quot; and a &quot;political slut&quot; for considering other parties before choosing to run for the Liberals. Martin then targeted Ouellette&#x27;s wife and accused her of being afraid to venture into the riding because of fear of theft. Martin later apologized for his comments.

<text>Virginia Hamilton Adair (February 28, 1913, New York City – September 16, 2004, Claremont, California) was an American poet who became famous later in life with the 1996 publication of &quot;Ants on the Melon&quot;.

==Background==
Mary Virginia Hamilton was born in the Bronx and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. She attended Montclair Kimberley Academy, graduating in the class of 1929. She disliked the name &quot;Mary&quot; and dropped it as a young adult. Adair composed her first poem at the age of two; after that, she wrote over a thousand poems. Exposed to poetry as a young child through her father, she began writing her own poems regularly at age six. More than seventy were published in journals and major magazines, such as the &quot;Atlantic&quot; and the &quot;New Yorker&quot;.

She received her B.A. in English from Mount Holyoke College in 1933 and her M.A. from Radcliffe College. Later she was professor emerita at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, in Pomona, California, where she taught from 1957 to 1980.

==Career==
Though she published work during the 1930s and 1940s in &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Adair did not publish again for almost 50 years. There were several factors which preoccupied her over those decades and took her attention away from publishing her own work. These included her 1936 marriage to prominent historian Douglass Adair, motherhood (she had three children), and an academic career. She was also soured on publishing her work due to her distaste for the gamesmanship of the publishing world.

Adair&#x27;s return to publishing came in the 1990s, following her husband&#x27;s 1968 suicide, her retirement from teaching, and her loss of sight from glaucoma. Adair&#x27;s friend and fellow poet Robert Mezey forwarded some of her work to Alice Quinn, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s poetry editor. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published the work in 1995, and the subsequently published &quot;Ants on the Melon&quot;. Adair&#x27;s work then appeared regularly in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

<doc id="1005629" wikidata="Q15521205" url="?curid=1005629" title="James Calvin Wilsey">
<text>James Calvin Wilsey (July 12, 1957 – December 24, 2018) was an American musician. He played bass with San Francisco punk band the Avengers, but became better known as the lead guitarist for Chris Isaak&#x27;s band Silvertone. He featured on Isaak&#x27;s albums &quot;Silvertone,&quot; &quot;Chris Isaak,&quot; &quot;Heart Shaped World,&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Days&quot;, and is widely remembered for his distinctive guitar tone and technique, being dubbed the &quot;King of Slow&quot; by fans. After leaving Isaak&#x27;s band, Wilsey pursued various solo projects while struggling with drug addiction and, toward the end of his life, periods of homelessness. He died from multiple organ failure related to hepatitis and drug use.

==Musical style==
Wilsey&#x27;s 1965 Fender Stratocaster and use of reverb, delay and gentle vibrato gave a distinctive sound to Isaak hits such as &quot;Wicked Game&quot; (the opening two-note riff, in his own words, &quot;crystallizes Wilsey&#x27;s approach&quot;) and &quot;Blue Hotel&quot;. Producer Erik Jacobsen remarked, &quot;In terms of the feeling Jimmy was able to put into a song with the wang bar and the tremolo and effects — Jimmy had a really magical touch...&quot;

==Career==
In 1977, Wilsey joined the Avengers, a pioneering band in the San Francisco punk rock scene. The band notably opened for the Sex Pistols at the Winterland Ballroom in January 1978, which led to Pistols guitarist Steve Jones sponsoring their recording career. Though the Avengers only released two EPs and a few compilation tracks during their initial run, the band influenced later San Francisco bands such as Dead Kennedys and Flipper, with Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Fluoride praising Wilsey&#x27;s use of octaves.

Wilsey joined Chris Isaak&#x27;s band Silvertone shortly after its formation in 1980. They initially played in many local San Francisco night clubs. Isaak recalled upon Wilsey&#x27;s death that &quot;Jimmy had so much heart and a great sound&quot;. However, the two became estranged by the early 1990s due to Wilsey&#x27;s impatience with Isaak&#x27;s behavior and his own worsening drug problems.

In 1998, Wilsey formed a short-lived instrumental band called the Mysteries. Dropping the moniker &quot;Calvin&quot;, Wilsey released a solo album of guitar instrumentals in 2008, titled &quot;El Dorado&quot;, which paid homage to musical influences such as Duane Eddy, the Shadows, Billy Strange, James Burton and Link Wray. Wilsey&#x27;s last commercial recording under his own name was in 2012, when he contributed a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; to the soundtrack to the film &quot;Killing Them Softly&quot;. In 2017, he played guitar on Miss Derringer&#x27;s cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In the 1990s, Wilsey met fashion boutique owner and designer Winter Mullender. They married in 2003 and had a son, Waylon. They divorced in 2008. Wilsey&#x27;s health declined and in 2013 he developed hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver. His drug use reportedly continued during this time. He reconnected and temporarily cohabited with Mullender, but they were evicted in 2018 and became homeless. Wilsey was taken to LAC+USC Medical Center in December of that year with the onset of organ failure, and died on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.

<doc id="1005632" wikidata="Q1269411" url="?curid=1005632" title="Parthamaspates of Parthia">
<text>Parthamaspates was a Parthian prince who ruled as a Roman client king in Mesopotamia, and later of Osroene during the early second century AD. He was the son of the Parthian emperor Osroes I.

== Biography ==
After spending much of his life in Roman exile, he accompanied the emperor Trajan on the latter&#x27;s campaign to conquer Parthia. Trajan originally planned to annex Ctesiphon as part of the Roman Empire, but ultimately decided instead to place Parthamaspates on his father&#x27;s throne as a Roman client, doing so in 116. Trajan effectively crowned Parthamaspates as a king of Parthia.

Following Roman withdrawal from the area, Osroes easily defeated Parthamaspates and reclaimed the Parthian throne.

After his defeat in Parthia, Parthamaspates again fled to the Romans who then, as a consolation, granted him the co-rule of Osroene, a small Roman client state between Asia Minor and Syria. He was king of Osroene together with Yalur from 118 to 122, and afterwards sole ruler to 123.
From his territory of Osroene, he is known to have traded with the Kushan Empire, goods being sent by sea and through the Indus River.

Long after the failure of Parthamaspates, Rome still claimed to have control of Parthian land, as shown in a coin of Antoninus Pius (138–161 AD) with the image of a subdued &quot;Parthia&quot; offering the crown to him.

<doc id="1005639" wikidata="Q4951617" url="?curid=1005639" title="Box score (baseball)">
<text>A box score is a chart used in baseball to present data about player achievement in a particular game. An abbreviated version of the box score, duplicated from the field scoreboard, is the line score. The Baseball Hall of Fame credits Henry Chadwick with the invention of the box score in 1858.

==Line score==
The line score is a two-line chart that reports each team&#x27;s run totals by inning, and total runs, total hits, and total errors on a line. The visiting team is on the top line and the home team on the bottom line. The terms &quot;top of the inning&quot; and &quot;bottom of the inning&quot; are derived from their positions in the line score. Sometimes, the winning team is bolded or colored for quick-reference. If the home team is leading after the top of the 9th inning, an &quot;X&quot; is placed for that team&#x27;s entry in the line score for the bottom of the 9th inning instead of a number of runs scored since the team does not bat in the bottom of the 9th inning.

Line score for the Brooklyn Dodgers–New York Giants pennant-winning game of October 3, 1951:
==Box score==
The box score lists the line score as well as individual and team performance in the game. The statistics used are those recorded by the official scorer of each game.

The following box score is of a notable game in baseball history, Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.
(&quot;All game references below refer to the box score above.&quot;)

At the top of the box score, the editor of a publication may list the time, date, and/or place of the game. In the example, the stadium&#x27;s name (&quot;the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome&quot;) and city (&quot;Minneapolis&quot;) are listed.

The line score is always listed as part of the box score, usually near the top; it lists the total runs scored in each inning. (&quot;The Atlanta Braves scored two runs in the fifth inning and one in the seventh. The Minnesota Twins scored two runs in the first inning, one in the fifth, and one in the eleventh. &quot;) Innings are normally grouped in sets of three for ease of reading. The team totals of runs, hits, and errors are listed last, after a separating character such as a dash. The actual score of the game is represented by the first column after the dash; (&quot;the Twins won this game four runs to three.&quot;)

The batting performances of each player in the game are grouped by team, with the visiting team listed first. Players are listed by last name in the order in which they were listed on the lineup card for the game, showing all players who enter the game at any point whether they make a plate appearance or not. Their fielding positions or batting roles are normally listed next to their last name. Typically only last names are used, unless two players with the same name appear in the game, in which case a distinctive first initial is also used. When a player switches fielding position, both positions are listed. (&quot;Brian Hunter, in the sixth position of the Braves&#x27; batting order, started at left field but also served as the first baseman.&quot;) Substitute players are listed where they were placed in the batting order (in cases such as a double switch, not necessarily in the position of the player they replaced). Players who had an offensive role only are listed by that role: &quot;ph&quot; if they entered as a pinch hitter or &quot;pr&quot; if as a pinch runner. Substitutes who enter for defensive purposes and do not make a plate appearance have their fielding position shown and their batting line score shown as zeros. When a pinch hitter or pinch runner remains in the game, his fielding position is also listed. Some box scores will indent substitutes&#x27; names to indicate their spot in the order was the same as the non-indented starter&#x27;s name above it; others will leave all names left-justified. (&quot;The Twins&#x27; Brian Harper pinch hit for Junior Ortiz and then remained in the game as catcher.&quot;)

Batting statistics are displayed to the right of the names in the lineup. At minimum are shown each batter&#x27;s at bats, runs, hits, and runs batted in. Some box scores show other player statistics such as home runs, stolen bases, bases on balls, strikeouts, fielding errors, times left on base, home runs, or season batting average. At the bottom of the lineup are the team totals for each category.

Additional batting, fielding, and base-running statistics are listed in non-tabular form normally below the batting order summaries:
*E – errors (&quot;Brian Hunter committed an error, his first of the postseason series&quot;).
*DP – double plays (&quot;Each team turned two double plays&quot;.) Some box scores list the fielders involved.
*2B – doubles (&quot;Shane Mack hit a double, on a pitch from Steve Avery, his first in the postseason&quot;).
*3B – triples (&quot;Kirby Puckett hit a triple, on a pitch from Avery, his first&quot;).
*HR – home runs (&quot;There were two home runs in the game. With one out, Terry Pendleton hit his second home run of the series, a home run with a man on base on a pitch from Scott Erickson in the fifth inning; with no outs, Puckett hit home run with no one on base in the eleventh inning, his second of the series, which won the game for Minnesota.&quot;)
*HBP – batters hit by a pitch (&quot;Lonnie Smith was hit by a pitch from Erickson. It was his first time being hit in this series&quot;)
*SF – sacrifice fly (&quot;Puckett was credited with a sacrifice fly, hit off of Avery.&quot;)
*CS – caught stealing (&quot;Keith Mitchell was thrown out by Brian Harper when attempting to steal second base on a pitch by Rick Aguilera.&quot;)
*SB – stolen base (&quot;Dan Gladden stole his second base of the series on a pitch from Avery to Greg Olson; Puckett also stole second on a pitch from Mike Stanton--his first stolen base of the series.&quot;)
*TB – total bases (It&#x27;s one for a single, two for a double, three for a triple and four for a home run. For example, if a batter has two singles, a double and a home run, this would be eight total bases.)

Below the batting orders and line score, the pitching summary is listed. Each pitcher used in the game is listed, along with any decision awarded to that pitcher. A pitcher can be credited with a win, a loss, a save, or a hold. Cumulative totals for pitching decisions are also shown, for either regular season or post-season play. To the right of each pitcher&#x27;s name are recorded the total innings pitched, hits given up, runs allowed, earned runs allowed, bases on balls issued, and strikeouts made. More elaborate statistics may also be displayed, such as home runs allowed, pitch count, or the pitcher&#x27;s cumulative earned run average.

Other pitching events are shown below the summary.
*WP – wild pitch thrown (&quot;Mark Guthrie threw one wild pitch, his first of the series.&quot;)
*HBP – hit by pitch, the reverse of the listing from the batting summary (&quot;Erickson hit Lonnie Smith with a pitch, his first hit batsman of the series&quot;).

Other overall game information is shown at the bottom of the box score.
*U – umpire crew (&quot;Six umpires worked this game, listed by umpiring position. The home plate umpire is listed first, then the umpires for each base in order, then the left and right field umpires, if any. In inter-league play, league affiliations were also shown, but, with the merger of the major-league umpiring staffs prior to the 2000 season, these references have been eliminated .&quot;)
*T – time of the game, not counting rain delays or light failure (&quot;The game was played in three hours and forty-six minutes&quot;.)
*A – paid attendance (&quot;55,155 tickets were sold for this game.&quot;)
Most box scores also give the temperature, weather, and wind speed/direction.

Other events not shown in the example but recorded in most box scores include sacrifice hits (&quot;S&quot;), triple plays (&quot;TP&quot;), balks (&quot;BK&quot;), blown saves (&quot;BS&quot;), and passed balls (&quot;PB&quot;). Many box scores, to save space, do not list any categories where none of that event occurred in the game. Others will list the category followed by &quot; – None&quot;.

In a baseball game, the number of plate appearances for each team must be equal to the number of batters put out, scored, and left on base. A box score is in balance (or proved) when the total of the team&#x27;s times at bat, bases on balls received, hit batters, sacrifice bunts, sacrifice flies and batters awarded first base because of interference or obstruction equals the total of that team&#x27;s runs, players left on base and the opposing team&#x27;s putouts. In other words, the box score is accounting for the number of batters and what became of them (scored, left on base, or put out). If a box score is unbalanced, then there is a logical contradiction and thus an error somewhere in the box score.

==Early box scores==
The first box scores tended to be vaguely related to cricket scorekeeping, in that only two offense-oriented figures were presented for each batter: &quot;O&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, meaning &quot;number of times put out&quot; and &quot;number of runs scored&quot;, respectively.

As fan interest in all aspects of the game increased, the box scores were revised and expanded to include the offensive categories At-Bats, Runs, Hits and sometimes Total Bases; and the defensive categories Put-Outs, Assists and Errors for each batter, as well as a statistical summary underneath the lineups listing extra-base hits, innings pitched, earned runs, etc.

In baseball, if the team scheduled to bat last is leading after 8½ innings, there is no turn at bat for that team, as it would not affect the outcome of the game, so the last of the ninth is usually marked with an &quot;X&quot; as a placeholder in the line score. Some newspapers (and some scoreboards) in those days showed the home team in the top line, resulting in the peculiarity of an &quot;X&quot; placed in what appeared to be the &quot;top&quot; of the ninth. This practice was a carryover from the time when the home team had the choice of whether to bat first or last, another similarity with cricket. Teams would often choose to bat first, counting on their ability to &quot;get the jump&quot; on the visiting team (as with football teams that win the coin toss), but the potential for the visitors scoring the winning run in the last of ninth was clearly an unsatisfying situation for the fans. The rules eventually required the home team to bat last, but the practice of listing the home team first was carried on for a while, in some places, even when it did not square with the actual events of the game.

The offensive statistic Runs Batted In was developed in the early 1900s, and was soon being carried in the lineup portion of the box scores.

As relief pitching became more common, a separate &quot;lineup&quot; section for the pitchers was developed, carrying individual Innings Pitched; the number of Hits, Runs, Earned Runs, and Bases on Balls allowed; and Strike-Outs achieved.

By the late 1960s or so, in the interest of space, most newspapers dropped the defensive stats from the lineups, just carrying the list of errors (if any) in the game summary. For a special event, such as World Series play (especially if a local team is involved), newspapers still often print the wider version of the box score.

<doc id="1005650" wikidata="Q1644528" url="?curid=1005650" title="The Other Side of Heaven">
<text>The Other Side of Heaven is a 2001 American adventure drama film written and directed by Mitch Davis, based on John H. Groberg&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot;. The film stars Christopher Gorham as John Groberg and Anne Hathaway as Jean Groberg (née Sabin).

The film showcases Groberg&#x27;s experiences as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Tongan islands in the 1950s.

==Plot==
During the 1950s, John Groberg (Gorham) graduates from Brigham Young University and is called on a 3-year mission to Tonga. Throughout the film, Groberg and his fiancée, Jean (Hathaway), exchange letters monthly. After a long journey across the Pacific, Groberg arrives in Tonga and is sent to a group of very remote islands. He is assigned a native Tongan companion, Feki (Joe Folau). As a new missionary, he struggles with learning the language; he studies it intensely and learns more about Tongan culture.

Groberg encounters a number of obstacles in his mission. One night, he forgets instructions to cover his feet, and rats bite his soles while he is asleep. A local Christian minister warns the people not to listen to Groberg and Feki. Later, he sends four men to beat them. However, one of the men, Tomasi, prevents the attack. Groberg learns from the drunken Tomasi that he had been baptized a member of the LDS Church many years ago as a boy. Tomasi later begins attending church meetings. When a young boy falls out of a mango tree and becomes unconscious, Groberg gives him basic first aid and prays for him. When a young woman, at the behest of her family, attempts to seduce Elder Groberg, he responds by teaching her about marriage. A typhoon destroys trees, homes, and crops. People die in the storm, and many die due to starvation and dehydration. Groberg is close to dying himself when the local minister gives him the last of his food. After the supply boat finally arrives, the minister is found dead. Later, while traveling at sea, Groberg and his two counselors are caught in a large storm. He is washed overboard and fears for his life. He swims until he finds an island where he also locates his counselors, and they are later rescued and return to Tonga.

Groberg returns to his hut one day to find that his mission president has come to visit the island. He is unhappy because he has not heard from Groberg since he came to the island many months prior. Groberg describes some of the success they have experienced, and the president is shocked to learn of new branches and meeting places on outer islands that have not been authorized. Groberg and his counselors spend the entire night filling out the church records the president requested. In the morning, he finds the president is about to board a boat, and gives him a large sheaf of forms documenting all they have accomplished. When his time as a missionary comes to an end, Groberg receives a telegram instructing him to return to New Zealand where he will travel to Idaho Falls, Idaho. When he is ready to depart, many islanders gather in their best clothing to see him off, testifying to the impact he has had during his stay. Once he arrives in Idaho, he marries Jean and the two spend their honeymoon in a cottage by a beach.

==Production==
===Development===
Director Mitch Davis was inspired by John H. Groberg&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot;, and wanted to tell Groberg&#x27;s story via film. Deseret Book (at the time, Bookcraft) owned the rights, and the company wanted to ensure that Davis captured the &quot;spirit of the book&quot;. John Groberg consented for the movie to be made after meeting Davis, and then the rights were secured. Producer Gerald R. Molen is noted for his work on films such as &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The film&#x27;s budget was $7 million.

===Casting===
Christopher Gorham was cast in the lead role as John Groberg. Mitch Davis selected him after auditioning &quot;hundreds and hundreds of actors on both coasts&quot; because Gorham exhibited &quot;a little light in his eyes&quot;, according to Davis. He has since become a common name in Mormon cinema, appearing in other LDS roles with films such as &quot;We Love You, Sally Carmichael!&quot; and the sequel to &quot;Heaven&quot;, where he reprises the role of John Groberg. Anne Hathaway was cast as Jean Groberg (née Sabin). Hathaway stated that she liked how the character of Jean was committed to Groberg but lived her own life. Before filming her parts of &quot;Heaven&quot; in New Zealand, she auditioned for &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;.

===Filming===
The real John and Jean Groberg gave feedback on the script. Jean Groberg provided Davis with the letters she and John exchanged, and they were used in filming the scenes where John and Jean write to one another.

The film was shot on location in Auckland, New Zealand and the island of Rarotonga, capital of the Cook Islands. All of the filming equipment and necessary supplies had to arrive by boat. The island scenes were completed in two months. In both Rarotonga and Auckland, rain often threatened to delay shoots, but Davis claimed that his prayers delayed much rain while filming.

==Release==
Disney distributed &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;. After Hathaway was cast for the lead role in Disney&#x27;s 2001 movie adaptation of &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, distribution of &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; was delayed until after &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; released in the hopes that the latter&#x27;s anticipated success would boost the former.

The film opened theatrically on December 14, 2001, in two venues, earning $55,765 in its opening weekend, ranking number 41 in the domestic box office. By the end of its run, almost a year later, on December 2, 2002, the film grossed $4,720,371 domestically and $39,643 overseas for a worldwide total of $4,760,014.

==Critical reception==
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; has a 30% approval rating based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 4.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; preaches to the converted; others will likely consider it simplistic, even offensive, propaganda.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 38 out of 100 rating based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Professor of literature Terryl Givens noted that the film doesn&#x27;t mention Groberg&#x27;s faith or explain why he is serving his mission. He speculates that this could be an effort to &quot;universalize the message of Christian service and spiritual coming of age&quot;. 

==Sequel==
In February 2018, Davis announced that filming was starting for a sequel titled &quot;The Other Side of Heaven 2: Fire of Faith&quot;. Gorham, Folau, Lees, and Smith reprised their roles from the first film. Natalie Medlock played Jean Groberg, replacing Hathaway. The movie was based on Groberg&#x27;s second autobiographical novel, with the same title, set ten years after the first film. The story follows John returning to the island with his wife and five daughters during the period of time he served as an LDS Church mission president. It was released June 28, 2019. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 71% based on reviews from 7 critics.

<text>Quality Food Centers, Inc., better known as QFC, is an American supermarket chain based in Bellevue, Washington, east of Seattle. It is a subsidiary of Kroger and has 62 stores in western Washington and northwestern Oregon, primarily located in the Puget Sound region and Portland–Vancouver metropolitan area.

==History==

Jack Croco began his career in the grocery business in the 1940s in Boise, Idaho, working for Albertsons. By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson&#x27;s stores in the Seattle area. Soon afterward in 1955, Croco opened his own grocery store in Bellevue, called Lake Hills Thriftway.

The grocery chain that would come to be named QFC in 1963 was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way N.E. in Seattle by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp&#x27;s Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell&#x27;s Fine Candies. Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960, and remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65, though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins &amp; Co., which took QFC public in 1987.

Christopher A. Sinclair became the CEO in 1996; the following year, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company, which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Portland-based Fred Meyer, and several months later in May 1998, Kroger announced its intention to acquire Fred Meyer (and QFC), which was approved a year later. The Roosevelt store operated until 2012; it closed on May 5 to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.

A Fred Meyer store at the Broadway Market on Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill was replaced by a QFC in 2004.

==Expansion==

Over the years, QFC has expanded aggressively through acquisitions. When A&amp;P abandoned the Seattle area in 1974, QFC took over several locations. They expanded to surrounding counties in the 1990s by acquiring and renaming Olson&#x27;s Food Stores, Johnny&#x27;s Food Centers, Stock Market Grocery Stores, and several Thriftway stores. Between 1990 and 1996, thirty stores were acquired from eleven independent grocery chains. Among them was Olson&#x27;s Foods, a Lynnwood-based chain with twelve existing stores and four new stores in development. Reed&#x27;s Super Valu in Port Hadlock and Stock Market Foods in Port Townsend were acquired in 1997, and the company also expanded into Oregon in the Portland metropolitan area.

During the tenure of CEO Stuart Sloan in the 1980s, the company branded itself as an upmarket chain and began offering more premium items. It had an initial public offering in 1987. In the mid-1990s, QFC expanded to Southern California by acquiring Hughes Family Markets (which kept its name). By the mid-1990s, many Hughes store locations were sold to Ralphs, which was soon sold to Fred Meyer, later acquired by Kroger. A new flagship store opened in downtown Kirkland in 2019, with of space. A rebrand to &quot;the Q&quot; was proposed in 2018 but later rejected.

Kroger proposed an acquisition of rival grocer Albertsons in 2022 that would have required the combined company to spin off locations to preserve brand competition. Among the proposed aspects of the merger was a divestment of all but five of QFC&#x27;s 59 locations. The acquisition was rejected by the Federal Trade Commission in 2024, leaving QFC part of the Kroger Company.

==Philanthropy and labor relations==

In 1996, Stuart Sloan, former owner and chairman of QFC, promised to spend at least $1 million a year for the next eight years to overhaul one of Seattle Public Schools&#x27;s most challenged schools, T.T. Minor Elementary. The funds were donated in addition to public dollars and helped to pay for uniforms, smaller class sizes and a year-round schedule, though the manner in which the funds were applied sparked controversy.

Fred Meyer and QFC workers are primarily represented by UFCW Local 3000. After the union distributed Black Lives Matter buttons in 2020, Kroger managers prohibited their use by employees. The action was found to violate federal labor law by a National Labor Relations Board judge in May 2023.

<doc id="1005657" wikidata="Q1193522" url="?curid=1005657" title="Migrant hawker">
<text>The migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) is one of the smaller species of hawker dragonflies. It can be found away from water but for breeding it prefers still or slow-flowing water and can tolerate brackish sites. The flight period is from July to the end of October. &quot;A. mixta&quot; occurs in North Africa, southern and central Europe to the Baltic region.

==Identification==

&quot;A. mixta&quot; is a small &quot;aeshna&quot; which appears dark in flight. It is similar in appearance to other aeshnas but has a characteristic &quot;golf-tee&quot; shaped mark on the second segment of the abdomen (S2) which is diagnostic. In flight it looks like a small Emperor dragonfly with a blue abdomen which, when seen from the side, curves down. The main identification problem in the field is distinguishing this species from &quot;A. affinis&quot; where the two species fly together. The markings on the side of the thorax are different in &quot;A. affinis&quot; and &quot;A. mixta&quot;. In &quot;A. affinis&quot; the sides of the thorax are greeny yellow with fine black lines along the sutures. In &quot;A. mixta&quot; the sides of the thorax are similar in colour but the yellow is separated by dark brown areas so it gives the appearance of having two broad yellow stripes.
==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;A. mixta&quot; is found throughout central and southern Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and across Asia to China and Japan. As it is a migratory species it can occur outside its normal range and in recent years it has been spreading northwards. For example in the United Kingdom this insect was rare until the 1940s when it began migrating from the continent in large numbers. It continues to do so and is now a resident breeding species throughout England and Wales. It reached the Isle of Man in 1998 and Ireland in 2000. It breeds in lakes and ponds and is tolerant of brackish water. It is also found away from water hawking high amongst trees and bushes, but often resting low on vegetation. A specimen was discovered in early August 2011 adjacent to a riparian park in Calgary, Alberta. Another one was found on September 3, 2015 in Fort Collins, Colorado flying around in a backyard over a trampoline. Probably confusing it as a small, dark pond.

==Behavior==
&quot;A. mixta&quot; has been seen on the wing in all months of the year but most commonly from July to Late October or early November. After emergence, the immature adults fly away from water and spends their time feeding and becoming sexually mature. They are not territorial and they are often seen feeding or resting in groups, occasionally forming large feeding swarms. They can be found around trees and bushes quite high up. Once mature, they return to water and begin mating behaviour with the males patrolling looking for females. &quot;A. mixta&quot; males are less territorial than other male aeshnas. Males form a tandem pairing with a female on the wing and copulate. After mating the male and female split up and the female oviposits alone. The eggs develop and then enter dipause and it is as diapause eggs that &quot;A. mixta&quot; overwinter. In spring the eggs hatch into a prolarva which only lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, the prolarva then molts into a stadium 2 larva. Larval development is rapid and adults emerge in summer. &quot;A. mixta&quot; is a univoltine species, that is to say that it completes its life-cycle in one year.

<text>Akhaltsikhe ( ), formerly known as Lomsia (), is a small city in Georgia&#x27;s southwestern region () of Samtskhe–Javakheti. It is the administrative center of the Akhaltsikhe Municipality and the Samtskhe–Javakheti region. It is situated on both banks of the small river Potskhovi (a left tributary of the Kura), which divides the city between the old city in the north and new in the south.

The 9th-century Akhaltsikhe (Rabati) Castle, which was recently restored, is located in the old part of the city. It is one of the main attractions of the Samtskhe–Javakheti region, along with Vardzia, Vale, Okrostsikhe and Zarzma.

==Toponymy==
Akhaltsikhe is the Georgian name of the town, which literally means &quot;new fortress&quot;. It is attested in Arabic sources as (and ), in Persian as (also spelled as ), and in Turkish sources as . The Azerbaijani village of Axısxa is also named after it, due to the population of the village originating from Akhaltsikhe.

==History==

The town is mentioned among the settlements conquered by general Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri during the reign of Umayyad Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (661–680). During the Mongol domination of Georgia, local rulers of the House of Jaqeli, who ruled the feudal principality of Samtskhe-Saatabago, were invested with the title of atabeg and were allowed to be autonomous. In contemporaneous Persian and Turkish sources, these Jaqeli rulers were referred to as &quot;Ḳurḳūra&quot;, which derives from —the name of several Jaqeli rulers.

In 1579, during the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1578–1590, the Ottomans took the town. In the ensuing period, the Ottomans implanted Islam and Ottoman customs. In 1625, the town became the centre of the Akhalzik Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire known as and it held a resident Ottoman pasha. The town rose to strategic importance and became a leading hub of the Caucasian slave market. By the late 17th century, the town was home to 400 households, consisting of a mixed population of Turks, Armenians, Georgians, Greeks and Jews.

In 1828, during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, Russian troops under the command of General Ivan Paskevich captured the city and, as a consequence of the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople, it was ceded to the Russian Empire. The city initially become part of the Kutaisi Governorate, then of the Tiflis Governorate, becoming the administrative centre of the Akhaltsikhe uezd.

In the late 1980s the city was host to the Soviet Army&#x27;s 10th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which became a brigade of the Georgian land forces after the fall of the Soviet Union.

==Archaeology==

The highland environment between Akhaltsikhe and Aspindza presents a varied and complex array of archaeological features in different locations, elevations and topographies. This includes the alluvial flood-plain of the Kura River, all the way to the high grasslands.

Human habitation is attested already in the Early Bronze Age (4th millennium BC) and later. Artifacts from the Roman and medieval periods are also strongly represented in the area.

===Amiranis Gora===
The important archaeological site of Amiranis Gora is located on the northeastern outskirts of Akhaltsikhe. It was excavated by Tariel Chubinishvili. The earliest carbon date for Amiranis Gora is 3790-3373 cal BC. It was obtained from the charcoal of the metallurgical workshop which belonged to the earliest building horizon of Amiranis Gora This indicates a division of metallurgical production into extractive and processing branches.

Amiranis Gora is an important reference point for the study of the Early Bronze Age Kura–Araxes culture, also known as the Early Transcaucasian Culture. The many references include the architecture, burial practices, material culture and metallurgy. Amiranis Gora is one of the best sites with fixed stratigraphy of the Kura-Araxes culture. The carbon date for the Kura-Araxes material at Amiranis Gora is 3630-3048 cal B.C., which is very early.

<doc id="1005660" wikidata="Q1231314" url="?curid=1005660" title="Mambo Italiano (film)">
<text>Mambo Italiano is a 2003 Canadian comedy-drama film directed by Émile Gaudreault. The screenplay was written by Gaudreault and Steve Galluccio, based on Galluccio&#x27;s theatrical play by the same name. Both the play and the film are based on Galluccio&#x27;s own life and experiences.

==Plot==
Angelo Barberini is the oddball son of Italian immigrants Gino and Maria, who inadvertently ended up in Canada rather than the United States. Angelo shocks his parents – and his sister, Anna – by moving out on his own without getting married, and, shortly after that, shocks them further still when he reveals he is gay. But his boyfriend (and childhood best friend), policeman Nino Paventi, isn&#x27;t as ready to come out of the closet – especially not to his busybody Sicilian mother, Lina.

==Cast==
* Luke Kirby as Angelo Barberini
* Claudia Ferri as Anna Barberini
* Peter Miller as Nino Paventi
* Paul Sorvino as Gino Barberini
* Ginette Reno as Maria Barberini
* Mary Walsh as Lina Paventi
* Sophie Lorain as Pina Lunetti
* Tim Post as Peter
* Tara Nicodemo as Yolanda/Woman in Airplane/Jolene
* Pierrette Robitaille as Rosetta
* Dino Tavarone as Giorgio
* Mark Camacho as Johnny Christofaro
* Michel Perron as Father Carmignani
* Lou Vani as Marco
* Diane Lavallée as Mélanie

==Production==
Mambo Italiano was based on a play by Steve Galluccio, which was written based on his own real-life experiences growing up in an immigrant community in Montreal.

==Reception==
&quot;Mambo Italiano&quot; received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a 32% rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: &quot;A broad, shrill comedy that plays like a sitcom.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 41/100 rating, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Scott Brown from Entertainment Weekly wrote &quot;This is feel-good filmmaking, to be sure, but the culture clash here is more than a meaningless vehicle for fizzy wish fulfillment. The not-unpleasant result is hearty Italian fare with the half-life of Chinese takeout.&quot;

Janice Page from the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;No sophisticated dance, but it moves about with an open heart. And hey, it’s at least as funny as that Greek thing.&quot;
&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert gave the film a modest two stars and refers to the film &quot;in convenience&quot; as &quot;My Big Fat Gay Wedding&quot;.

==Follow-up==
Galluccio went on to create the sitcom &quot;Ciao Bella&quot;, which explored similar themes of culture clash that are examined in this film and the play it was based upon. Claudia Ferri, who played Angelo&#x27;s sister Anna in &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot;, played the lead role in &quot;Ciao Bella&quot;.

<text>Carl Franklin Hostetter is a Tolkien scholar and NASA computer scientist. He has edited and annotated many of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s linguistic writings, publishing them in &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot;, and edited collections of Middle-earth writings by scholars and by Tolkien himself.

== Career ==

=== NASA ===

Carl Hostetter joined NASA as a computer scientist at its Goddard Space Flight Center in 1985. In the 1990s, he edited the proceedings of the Goddard Space Conference for some years.

=== Tolkien scholar ===

Hostetter is a Tolkien scholar and key figure in the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship. He has written numerous articles on the linguistics of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. He ran the scholarly mailing list Lambengolmor from 2002 to its closure in 2020. He is the editor of the Tolkien linguistics journals &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Tengwestië&quot;. By arrangement with Christopher Tolkien, he (with other Tolkien scholars) edited and published a large quantity of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s writings on his constructed languages in &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot;.

== Reception ==

John S. Ryan, reviewing the 2000 collection &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s Legendarium: Essays on The History of Middle-earth&quot; (edited by Hostetter and Verlyn Flieger) for &quot;VII&quot;, called it a &quot;luminous companion&quot; to the 12 volumes of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, and &quot;clearly indispensable&quot;. The book won the 2002 Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inklings Studies.

The Tolkien scholar Douglas C. Kane, while welcoming the 2021 book &quot;The Nature of Middle-earth&quot;, writes that Hostetter &quot;appears to overstep his role as editor&quot; by presenting the materials according to his personal point of view. In particular, Kane states that Hostetter wrongly applies Tolkien&#x27;s remark that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was fundamentally religious and Catholic to the whole of the legendarium. Kane calls this contrary to Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editorial practice, and &quot;a blatant statement of intent&quot;. Kane quotes Verlyn Flieger&#x27;s remark that Tolkien&#x27;s work reflects the two sides of his nature; the work can be seen both &quot;as Catholic [and] not Christian.&quot;

<doc id="1005670" wikidata="Q2352623" url="?curid=1005670" title="M-22 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-22 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. It is long and follows the Lake Michigan shoreline of the Leelanau Peninsula, making up a portion of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour. It also passes through the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The highway is U-shaped as it rounds the peninsula running through tourist areas in Leland and Suttons Bay in addition to the national lakeshore.

M-22 is an original trunkline designation dating back to the 1919 designation of the system. Reroutings have moved the highway closer to the water between Suttons Bay and Traverse City. A section of the highway was used temporarily for another highway, M-109. Two sections of the highway have been designated as separate Pure Michigan Byways. The highway marker is used in marketing by a local business as a symbol of the region, a trademark for which has been the subject of legal controversies. A popular roadway in the area with tourists, the highway&#x27;s marker has also been the subject of sign theft.

==Route description==

The southern terminus is at US Highway 31 (US 31) northeast of Manistee and the northern terminus is in Traverse City. In between the trunkline loops north along Lake Michigan to Northport before turning south along the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. The road itself comprises numerous turns and hills, making it a very popular drive for tourists visiting the area from areas such as Chicago and Detroit, especially during autumn. The road runs north to the village of Onekama running east and north of Portage Lake before returning north to Arcadia. M-22 turns northeasterly to curve around the north shore of Crystal Lake after passing through Elberta and Frankfort. South of the Platte River, the highway crosses into the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. East of Platte Lake, M-22 turns northward again toward Empire, headquarters of the national park. M-22 takes the inland route between Little and Big Glen lakes, losing the Lake Michigan Circle Tour designation to M-109 until the two meet again in Glen Arbor. The roadway follows the shoreline of Pyramid Point and passes east out of the national park before turning north to Leland.
Continuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the reservation of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe&#x27;s two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a section of the city of Traverse City that is located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of a neighborhood of Greilickville. Here is the eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US 31/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan.

==Cultural references==

Broneah Kiteboarding, a company based in Traverse City, has adopted the M-22 marker as a logo and sells merchandise such as clothing and bumper stickers featuring it. As such, the logo has become a popular symbol for the company as well as a cultural symbol for the western Grand Traverse Bay area. The private corporation has attempted to trademark the road sign, which has been legally opposed by the Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette; that formal opposition was removed by his successor Dana Nessel in 2019.
In 2015, the readers of &quot;USA Today&quot; voted M-22 the &quot;best scenic autumn drive&quot; in the nation, noting that it offers &quot; of stellar autumn leaf-peeping&quot;.

Due to the popularity of the roadway, sign theft along parts of M-22 has become an issue for MDOT. The department announced in 2016 that it was removing the &quot;M&quot; from the top of some of the M-22 markers to combat the issue. The state had replaced about 90 signs in the previous three years, and a department spokesman said the popularity of the highway from merchandise sales and scenic travelers factored into those thefts. The new signs cost between $325 and $350 apiece to manufacture, no different from what the standard M-22 signs cost, and MDOT hoped that the modified signs will prove less popular with thieves. The new signs will be installed as replacements in the areas with the most thefts, like Leelanau County, while the rest of the highway will still receive the standard M-22 marker. A year later, sign theft was still an issue. The department started testing pavement markings because the other efforts had failed. The markings cost $175, but they last only three years compared to the ten-year lifespan of a sign.

==History==
M-22 is an original trunkline, dating to the July 1, 1919 designation of the system. In 1929, the highway was rerouted along the west side of Little Glen Lake, using the modern M-109 around the lake. M-22 would be rerouted back around to the present routing the next year, and M-109 was designated on the west side of the lake in its place.
Until 1936, M-22&#x27;s route was on Cherry Bend and Center roads in Leelanau County to Suttons Bay. At that time, M-22 was relocated along the west arm of Grand Traverse Bay onto Center Road up to Crain Hill Road In 1949, M-22 was relocated the rest of the way to Suttons Bay, and the former M-22 on Cherry Bend and Center roads became County Road 633. and in 1945, the last gravel stretch of M-22 from Leland to Northport was paved.

In Traverse City, M-22 originally started at Front and Union streets going west on Front to Elmwood, turning north onto Elmwood, then west on Bay Street to Greilickville. It was relocated onto the newly built Grand View Parkway in 1952, from Greilickville to Division Street (relocated US 31). In 2002, the route of M-22 from the Benzie–Leelanau county line northward to Northport and then south to Traverse City was designated as part of a Michigan Heritage Route along with M-109 and M-204 as the Leelanau Scenic Heritage Route; this moniker was renamed Pure Michigan Byway at the end of 2014. The remainder of the highway was designated as a separate byway in October 2016.

<doc id="1005681" wikidata="Q3139243" url="?curid=1005681" title="Chester Zoo">
<text>Chester Zoo is a zoo in Upton-by-Chester, Cheshire, England. Chester Zoo was opened in 1931 by George Mottershead and his family. The zoo is one of the UK&#x27;s largest zoos at and the zoo has a total land holding of approximately .

Chester Zoo is operated by the North of England Zoological Society, a registered charity founded in 1934. The zoo receives no government funding and is the most-visited wildlife attraction in Britain with more than 2 million visitors in 2019. In 2007 &quot;Forbes&quot; described the zoo as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world. In 2017 and more recently, 2024, the zoo was named as the best zoo in the UK and as also regarded as the third best in the world by TripAdvisor.
==History==

===Early history===
The Mottershead family&#x27;s market garden business was based in Shavington near Crewe. George Mottershead collected animals such as lizards and insects that arrived with exotic plants imported by the business. A visit to Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester as a boy in 1903 fuelled his developing interest in creating a zoo of his own.

Mottershead was wounded in the First World War and spent several years in a wheelchair. Despite this, his collection of animals grew and he began to search for a suitable home for his zoo. He chose Oakfield Manor in Upton-by-Chester, which was a country village then but now is a suburb of Chester. He bought Oakfield Manor for £3,500 in 1930. The house had of gardens and provided easy access to the railways and to Manchester and Liverpool. There were local objections, but Mottershead prevailed, and Chester Zoo opened to the public on 10 June 1931. The first animals were displayed in pens in the courtyard.

An Ordnance Survey inch-a-mile map published in 1936 shows the area around as farmland and villages and marks the present Zoo area north of Oakfield as &quot;Butter Hill&quot;.

Rapid expansion followed after the Second World War, despite the difficulty of sourcing materials. Mottershead had to be resourceful; the polar bear exhibit (1950) was built from recycled wartime road blocks and pillboxes. &quot;Always building&quot; was the zoo&#x27;s slogan at the time. Mottershead received the OBE, an honorary degree of MSc, and served as President of the International Union of Zoo Directors. He died in 1978 aged 84.

===Zoo design===
Mottershead wanted to build a zoo without the traditional Victorian iron bars to cage the animals. He was influenced by the ideas of Carl Hagenbeck, who invented the modern zoo concept and by Heini Hediger, a pioneer of ethology.

At Chester, Mottershead took Hagenbeck&#x27;s idea for moats and ditches as an alternative to cage bars, and extended their use throughout the zoo, often with species that Hagenbeck had not considered. For example, when chimpanzees were released into their new enclosure at Chester in 1956, a group of grassy islands, they were separated from visitors by no more than a strip of water. Nobody knew then if chimps could swim. It turned out that they could not, and today the chimp islands are a centrepiece of Chester Zoo.

In 1986 the zoo was enclosed with a fence, in line with the Zoo Licensing Act 1981.

===21st century===
Realm of the Red Ape, an Indonesian-forest-themed exhibit, featuring threatened Sumatran and Bornean orangutan, opened in May 2007.

In January 2009, Chester Zoo unveiled Natural Vision, a £225 million plan to transform itself into the largest conservation attraction in Europe. The first phase of the plan was to be a £90 million, enclosed African-rainforest-themed sanctuary containing a band of gorillas and a troop of chimpanzees, as well as okapi and a variety of tropical birds, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates, moving freely among lush vegetation. It included a water ride to take visitors through the exhibit. Natural Vision was to eventually include a 90-room hotel, a Conservation College, and a revamped main entrance that would link the zoo to a marina to be developed on zoo land, all to be completed by 2018. Plans went before the public for comment in June 2009.

The projected Heart of Africa bio-dome, along with plans for the hotel, were shelved in 2011 due to the loss of £40m potential funding when the North West Regional Development Agency was abolished.

In December 2012 planning permission was gained for a later phase of the Natural Vision masterplan. One of the largest zoo developments in Europe, Islands at Chester Zoo is a £40 million redevelopment project to extend the zoo&#x27;s footprint and recreate six island habitats of Southeast Asia. As of 2017 it is now open.

A 600,000 square foot nature reserve was opened in April 2018. The reserve sits outside the boundary of the main zoo and is free for people to enter.

In October 2018, two Indian elephant calves (Nandita Hi Way, age 3 years, and Aayu Hi Way, age 18 months), died of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV). From 1995 on this virus disease has caused many deaths of Indian elephants across the world in zoos and in the wild.

On 15 December 2018, an electrical fault caused a fire to break out at the Monsoon Forest Habitat. The zoo had to be evacuated and was closed. Fifteen fire crews attended the zoo along with two rapid response units and an ambulance. All mammals were accounted for and one person was treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. Some birds, frogs, fish and small insects were killed in the blaze. The zoo reopened on Sunday 16 December 2018.

Chester Zoo monorail was an internal transport system for visitors from 1991 to 2019, but was closed as it had become unreliable and covered less than half the zoo due to the zoo&#x27;s expansion to over . Land from the monorail will be used for a new attraction called Heart of Africa, an open African savannah habitat and vulture aviary. The zoo are also at the same time developing The Reserve Hotel project, a collection of 51 lodges, restaurant and access into the zoo.

==Management structure==

The North of England Zoological Society (NEZS) is the organisation that runs Chester Zoo. It was formed in 1931 by the zoo&#x27;s founder, George Mottershead.

The zoo is managed by a team led by CEO Jamie Christon DL and he reports to the Board of Trustees. Christon is tasked with focusing on the unified strategy which supports the Strategic Development Plan and Conservation Plan. The plan includes the development of Heart of Africa, The Reserve Hotel, new education facilities, The Square wedding venue, and from 2028 the development of African Forests. The executive focuses on education change and DEAI through its people and culture. Chester Zoo leads in public affairs and has influenced heavily at the heart of UK government.

The zoo employs over 650 permanent staff, increasing to over 1,000 during the main summer period, making it the largest zoo in the UK.

==Layout and facilities==
The zoo is bisected by a public bridleway, Flag Lane (formerly the Millennium Cycle Path). For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants&#x27; Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and mobility scooters, called Bats&#x27; Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone (now called Fruit Bat Forest), has improved the ability of visitors to circulate. The opening of the new bridge also meant that visitors are now able to view on foot animals that were previously visible only from the monorail, as well as panoramic views of the zoo itself.

For a long time the public entrance was at the east end off Caughall Road. In Summer 1995 the public entrance moved to the north side with dedicated access off the A41 Chester By-Pass. A brown sign which gave visitors directions to the new entrance was installed at the junction of the former entrance, and curiously it remained there until the 2010s. Thus the zoo is entered in the &#x27;newer&#x27; part west of Flag Lane, near the elephants, and the old car parks at the east end are being built over with service, admin and educational buildings. The new entrance was re-modelled in 2012 to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The zoo owns land outside the public area, and uses that land to grow food for its herbivorous animals.

Chester&#x27;s catering facilities include Bembé Kitchen (formerly the Tsavo Cafe) near the main entrance which opened in 2006 to replace the former Oasis Cafe (formerly Mpila Snack Bar until the early 1980s). June&#x27;s Pavilion (formerly the Jubilee Cafe and latterly the Ark Restaurant) is on the west of the zoo and Manado Street Kitchen is found on Sulawesi in the Islands exhibit. The Oakfield is a restaurant in a Victorian mansion house near the lion enclosure, and along with the Acorn Bar, are both used for private functions as well as catering to zoo visitors.

There are children&#x27;s play areas, shops, kiosks and several picnic lawns around the zoo. A second pedestrian entrance is located in the southeast corner of the zoo behind Oakfield House.

==Species and animals==
Chester Zoo holds a large and diverse collection. At the end of 2007, over half the species at the zoo appeared on the IUCN Red List and 155 were classified as threatened species. 134 species were kept as part of a managed captive breeding programme. The zoo manages the studbooks for Congo buffalo, jaguar, blue-eyed cockatoo, Madagascan tree boa, gemsbok (all ESB species), eastern black rhinoceros, Ecuadorian amazon parrot, Mindanao writhe-billed hornbill, Sumatran tiger and Rodrigues flying fox (all EEP species). In addition, Chester holds 265 threatened plant species.
At the end of 2015, Chester Zoo became the first zoo outside of New Zealand to breed the tuatara.

==Animal exhibits==

===Islands at Chester Zoo===

The zoo opened Islands at Chester Zoo in July 2015, a project extending the footprint of the zoo by 15 acres and built to the south of the west half of the current site.

Islands showcases areas where the zoo is involved in conservation programmes, including Sumatra, the Philippines and Indonesia. Visitors are able to walk between the islands via a series of bridges and can also view the animals whilst on a boat trip. The project also includes educational exhibits, play areas and a restaurant, the Manado Street Kitchen.
The exhibit is opening in phases with phase one including a boat trip around the enclosures for visitors to view some of the zoo&#x27;s key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, Javan banteng, lowland anoa and North Sulawesi babirusa; plus a walk-through bird aviary featuring the critically endangered Bali starling, as well as Java sparrows, pied imperial pigeons and purple-naped lories .
Phase two opened later in the summer and includes Sumatran tigers, Sunda gharials, and other reptiles (such as tentacled snakes and brown tortoises), birds (Javan rhinoceros hornbills, and Indonesian songbirds) invertebrates and a variety of fish species. That phase including Monsoon Forest is now complete and open with the installation of the Sumatran orangutans and the arrival of a breeding pair of Javan silvery gibbons in December 2015.

A third phase for Islands opened in summer 2017. The third phase included new exhibits for Malayan sun bear, Palawan binturongs, Malayan tapir, and a new songbird aviary featuring various birds from Indonesia as well as the critically endangered Javan green magpie. The magpies are, sometimes, off-show and replaced by sumatran laughingthrush.
===Elephants of the Asian Forest===
Chester was the first zoo in the UK to successfully breed Asian elephants in captivity. The most famous of these was Jubilee (1977–2003), so named as he was born in 1977, the year of the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. The zoo has a breeding herd of eight elephants, composed of two males and six females – the breeding male Aung-Bo, ageing female Maya, her daughters Sithami and Nandita, and Sithami&#x27;s son, Aayu who was born in January 2017 and daughter Sundara and her daughter Indali who was born in December 2016. The elephant house also used to house African elephants, rhinos, hippos and tapirs. Motty, a hybrid African-Asian elephant calf was born in July 1978, but died in infancy.

A £2 million breeding facility modelled on an Assam (India) rainforest called Elephants of the Asian Forest opened in Easter 2006, as a major alteration of the zoo&#x27;s previous elephant house. Inside the elephant house, other indigenous Asian species are exhibited, including Great hornbills, azure-winged magpies, red-billed blue magpies, prevost&#x27;s squirrels, belanger&#x27;s tree shrews, northern Luzon giant cloud rats, There is an aquarium for clown loach and tiger barb fish.

On 10 February 2011 Sheba, the matriarch of Chester Zoo’s Asian elephant herd, had to be put down because of a digestive tract illness caused by an inability to chew her food because her last molar teeth were worn to stumps.

===Spirit of the Jaguar===
Sponsored by Jaguar Cars, Spirit of the Jaguar opened in 2001 and was designed by McCormick Architecture. The exhibit is split into four sections. The two inside are modelled on a rainforest and a dry savannah, and the two outside contain rivers and pools so that the jaguars can exercise their swimming skills. A new breeding pair of Jaguars, Napo (Spotted male) and Goshi (Black female) arrived from separate French zoos in Spring 2013. Spirit of the Jaguar is also home to a colony of leaf-cutter ants, Azara&#x27;s agoutis, bush dogs, sloths, and an aquarium featuring numerous rainforest fish such as Discus fish and shoals of tetra. The exhibit went through another makeover in late 2011, and now has a theme focusing on human/wildlife conflict. An outdoor enclosure for two-toed sloths is currently under-going construction.

===Realm of the Red Ape===
Realm of the Red Ape is a £3.5 million extension to the existing orangutan house, home to Bornean orangutans, and was the most expensive capital project in the zoo&#x27;s history before the construction of Islands. The exhibit opened to the public on 26 May 2007 after a two-year construction period. It comprises a new two-story building linked to the existing orangutan house with three indoor and two outdoor enclosures, providing accommodation for a larger number of apes. The outdoor areas can be viewed from a first floor public gallery and feature mesh roofs supported by tree-like structures which act as climbing frames for the apes. A further enclosure houses a group of lar gibbons.

Animals and plants from Indonesia are exhibited inside Realm of the Red Ape in a rainforest-themed setting. Birds on display include blue-crowned hanging parrots, Timor sparrows, chestnut-backed thrushes, roul-roul partridges, superb fruit doves and black-naped fruit doves. Crocodile monitors, reticulated pythons, red-tailed racers, Bell&#x27;s Angle-Head Lizards, Chinese water dragons, emerald tree monitors, white-lipped tree vipers and green tree pythons feature among the reptiles. Invertebrates include Rhinoceros beetles, giant walking sticks, common crow butterflies jungle nymphs, praying mantises, Malaysian Katydids and leaf insects.

The zoo&#x27;s Sumatran orangutans were relocated from Realm of the Red Ape to a new exhibit in the Islands development during January 2016.

===The Chimpanzee Breeding Centre===
This pavilion was opened in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester, and is home to 26 Western chimpanzees. This is the largest colony of chimps in Europe, housed in the Roundhouse, a conical indoor enclosure linked to an outside moated island. The island is planted with many bushes and has large poles for the chimps to climb on. The inside area has a climbing frame that allows the chimps to stay close together on several levels of platform. There are seven interconnected off-show dens.

===Tsavo Rhino Experience===
The zoo&#x27;s black rhinoceros exhibit, modelled on the Tsavo National Park in Kenya, opened in 2003 at a cost of £2 million. The zoo has a successful rhinoceros breeding programme and currently keeps eight rhinos. Meerkats and crested porcupines are kept in a co-habitated enclosure nearby, and a nearby paddock is home to warthogs.

===Tsavo Bird Safari===
In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses von der decken&#x27;s hornbills, lilac-breasted rollers, hammerkops, weaver birds and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At the other side of the Bird Safari is a Large pen for wattled cranes and Black Crowned Cranes.

===Latin American Wetland Aviary===
The former Caribbean flamingo exhibit has been redeveloped as a mixed-species netted aviary for Latin American wetland birds. The new exhibit opened in June 2021, coinciding with the Zoo&#x27;s 90th anniversary. Visitors enter the aviary along a walkway and viewing platform which project out over a lake, giving uninterrupted views of the birds. In addition to the 100-strong flock of flamingos, the aviary is home to scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, black-necked stilts, Orinoco geese, Muscovy ducks, ringed teals, black-bellied whistling ducks, saffron finches and other waterfowl species.

===Fruit Bat Forest===
Fruit Bat Forest is the largest free-flying bat cave in Europe. The cave holds two species of bat: Rodrigues fruit bats, and Seba&#x27;s short-tailed bats. It is also home to a varied collection of other species including, common tenrecs and blind cave fish.

===Monkey Islands===
Monkey Islands was opened in 1997, replacing the old monkey house, and is currently home to four monkey species: Colombian spider monkeys, mandrills, lion-tailed macaques and Buffy-headed capuchins. Campbell&#x27;s guenons and porcupines were formerly housed with the mandrills, and Sulawesi crested macaques were kept here until they moved to &#x27;Islands&#x27; in 2015. Visitors enter the monkey house and view the animals from a central corridor. Each species has a glass-fronted indoor enclosure with climbing apparatus and an outdoor enclosure, moated and heavily planted.

===Miniature Monkeys===
Miniature Monkeys, opened in May 2004, consists of two enclosures. The first is home to a pair of pied tamarins with pygmy marmosets, and the second is shared by three emperor tamarins and three golden-headed lion tamarins. Geoffrey&#x27;s marmosets, black-tailed marmosets, black lion tamarins, red titi monkeys and white-faced sakis have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.

===Bears of the Cloud Forest===
Bears of the Cloud Forest opened in 2004 and is home to a pair of spectacled bears and other South American animals. The purpose-built exhibit is designed to mimic the bear&#x27;s natural habitat by providing trees and a rocky terrain. Nearby are paddocks housing capybaras, giant anteaters, and Brazilian tapirs. Guanacos and vicuñas were previously housed in this section, along with rheas.

===Secret World of the Okapi===
Formerly the camel house, this enclosure adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house okapis. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo in the same year. In 2006, Dicky left for London Zoo to make way for a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009, Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, Gaboon vipers and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped grass mice have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. The success was repeated in 2014 with the birth of a new male calf.

===Dragons in Danger===
This exhibit is primarily a herpetarium for the zoo&#x27;s Komodo dragons, Jantan and Ora who arrived from Prague Zoo in 2014, originating from the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was opened in 1998 and extended in 2003 to include an outdoor enclosure used by the dragons in the warmer summer months. The exhibit is built on the site of the zoo&#x27;s former bird house. In 2007, several young baby Komodo dragons were put on display after one of the zoo&#x27;s two females laid eggs which hatched although the female had not been mated; this is parthenogenesis, the first such case recorded in this species. The exhibit was revamped in 2009 to house Caribbean iguanas in one section of the building. It now currently houses spiny turtles in one side and critically endangered Mountain Chicken Frogs along with Caribbean Hermit Crabs in the other.

Dragons in Danger also houses various Indonesian and Philippine rainforest birds, such as Palawan peacock-pheasants, pheasant pigeons, Montserrat Orioles and Visayan tarictic hornbills. Recently added was a pair of Philippine Mouse Deer which have successfully bred. Also housed here are Montserrat tarantulas, which Chester bred in 2016 for the first time in captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include Socorro doves, Mindanao bleeding-hearts, Papuan lorikeets and Saint Lucia parrots.

===Mongoose Mania===
For some time, this small area on the eastern part of the zoo used to be a children&#x27;s petting farm until 2001 when it permanently closed due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The petting farm later became a picnic lawn, and a former kunekune pig enclosure has been demolished in favour of a food stall.

Mongoose Mania, which houses dwarf mongooses features tunnels beneath the enclosure which allow children to crawl through, popping up their heads into plastic domes to give them a mongoose&#x27;s eye view of the world. Previously, from opening in 2002 until 2009, the enclosure housed prairie dogs, which were originally housed in large enclosures near the rhinos (one of which was shared with the tapirs and capybaras) on the western part of the zoo.

===Giant otters and penguins===
In early 2010, the California sea lions left the collection. During this time, the pool was converted to house a new species to the zoo. The giant otters went on show for the first time on 26 March 2010. The zoo bred their first pups in 2013.

In the neighbouring enclosure, a large breeding group of over 50 Humboldt penguins have their own pool, and visitors can watch the birds from an underwater viewing window.

===Tropical Realm===
Tropical Realm is Britain&#x27;s largest tropical house at over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, most of the interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are free-flying, including Nicobar pigeons, various species of starlings and ground birds such as crested partridges.

Aviaries and vivaria are arranged around the sides of the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for birds of paradise and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one pure-bred and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, Palawan peacock-pheasants, Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, Mindanao bleeding-hearts, Green aracari and Philippine scops owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbirds.

The Tropical Realm is also the centre of the reptile collection. The crocodile pools (which formerly housed dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) ; rhinoceros ratsnakes, emerald tree boas and eyelash vipers now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of serrated casquehead iguanas, green-crested Lizards, northern caiman lizards, and a Parson&#x27;s chameleon.

Tortoises are represented by Galápagos and radiated tortoises with Vietnamese box turtles. Amphibians include poison dart frogs, Golden mantellas, a Rio Cauca caecilian, false tomato frogs and Morelet&#x27;s tree frogs.

From late 2015 to early 2016, the former golden-bellied capuchin exhibit at the rear of Tropical Realm was converted to house a pair of aye-ayes and a group of Malagasy giant rats.

===Madagascar===
Opened in 2019 as Madagascar Forest, this development exhibits endangered species from Madagascar. Themed displays also provide visitors with information on field conservation projects supported by the Zoo. The 5,875m2 site is located in the centre of the zoo and was previously occupied by the Sumatran tiger exhibit and a large aviary for European birds (Europe on the Edge). Madagascar comprises three animal exhibits linked by winding visitor pathways. The first and second exhibits house fossa, which bred for the first time at the zoo in 2022, and critically endangered Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka. The third and largest exhibit is a walkthrough lemur enclosure which houses ring tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, crowned lemurs, red-bellied lemurs and black lemurs.

===Rare Parrot Breeding Centre===
Parrots on display here include red-vented cockatoos, lesser sulphur-crested cockatoos, red-and-blue lories, yellow-backed chattering lories, Mount Apo lorikeets and blue-and-yellow macaws. The only ones on show are Ecuador Amazons. Most of the birds were moved to the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre from the old parrot house when it was demolished in 2005 to make way for Realm of the Red Ape.

===Mythical Macaws===
This exhibit consists of three aviaries housing rare and endangered South American birds. In the aviary outside the Tropical Realm, a group of Great green macaws are housed here. Two other aviaries further up house Red-billed Curassow in one, and the other Elegant crested tinamou and Blue-throated macaw.

===Aquarium===
The aquarium is a small and traditional building (one of the oldest at the zoo, built by George Mottershead&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law in the 1950s) housing a varied collection of freshwater and marine fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. It has had notable success breeding seahorses and achieved the first captive breeding of the freshwater motoro stingray.

Other notable fish include Epaulette Sharks, Mudskippers, tropical reef fish and various Lake Malawi cichlids. Invertebrates such as starfish, sea urchins and several species of coral and shrimps are housed with the fish.

===Asian Plains and paddocks===
In 2008, Asian Plains received its official opening. Based around a mixed-species paddock featuring Burmese brown-antlered deer, the exhibit has recently been extended to include new enclosures for greater one-horned rhinoceroses and cheetahs. The male rhino was joined by a female in 2008 to form a pair which the zoo hoped would breed. Sadly, in November 2009, the zoo&#x27;s male Indian rhino, Patna, was put down due to a longstanding leg injury. The zoo obtained a replacement male from Edinburgh Zoo in March 2010. Since they were closely related, the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation – Baabu has now been exchanged for Beni from Plzeň Zoo. The paddocks formerly housed barasingha, Ankole cattle blackbuck and sitatunga.

Other paddocks on the west side of the zoo support grazing herds of Grevy&#x27;s zebras, sitatunga, Kirk&#x27;s dik-diks, scimitar-horned oryxes, eastern bongos, lesser kudus and roan antelopes.

Przewalski&#x27;s horses left the collection in 2009 to make way for the new African hunting dog enclosure. Other animals formerly housed here were Père David&#x27;s deer, red-necked wallabies, ostriches and emus.

===Mkomazi National Park Painted Dogs Conserve===
In 2011, a new exhibit housing African painted dogs on the site of the former Przewalski&#x27;s horse paddock was opened. In the style of an African Research Station with an African Village, the exhibit has a dry landscape with fake kopje stones. A pack of four African painted dogs are the main exhibit, however aardvarks and rock hyraxes are nearby.

===Forest Zone and Butterfly Journey===
The northeast area of the zoo is where many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the chimpanzees, okapis, jaguars, condors and Tropical Realm, there are enclosures for Congo buffaloes, and red river hogs. Nearby, is a large paddock and house for the zoo&#x27;s Rothschild giraffe herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native sand lizards, and a mixed enclosure for red-billed curassows and Inca Jays.

An enclosure formerly housing maned wolves was demolished and replaced in 2008 by a heated butterfly house called Butterfly Journey, which is based around the life cycle of a butterfly, featuring free-flying butterflies and moths (The exotic species on show include blue morphos, giant owls, glasswings, swallowtails and Atlas moths), a cabinet of cocoons, and a caterpillar hatchery. Also featured in this exhibit is an area for a variety of different invertebrates and a mesh enclosure for panther chameleons.

Animals formerly displayed in Forest Zone include maned wolves, babirusa, warthogs, Chilean pudú, Mallorcan midwife toads, golden-bellied capuchins, visayan warty pigs, ring-tailed coatis and bactrian camels.

===Big cats===
As well as jaguars, Chester Zoo keeps lions, tigers and cheetahs in its big cat collection. The lions are the Asiatic subspecies found only in the Gir Forest in India in the wild. The zoo&#x27;s former resident male Asoka was joined by a female, Asha, from Rome in 2006. The pair have bred on three occasions, but so far their only offspring to survive has been a male cub, Tejas, born and hand-reared in 2007. His upbringing was featured prominently in the first series of Zoo Days. Tejas left Chester Zoo for Besancon early in 2008 as part of the European breeding programme for this subspecies. Asoka left the zoo in early 2010, he was moved to Rome Zoo as part of the European breeding programme. His replacement is 3-year-old Iblis, who arrived from Planckendael Zoo in Belgium. In late summer 2011, Asha retired to Santillana Zoo and was replaced by four-year females Kiburi and Kumari.

In 2007, a male Sumatran tiger called Kepala arrived from Dudley Zoo to join the two resident female Bengal tigers, who left in 2008. The same year, the zoo acquired a female tiger named Kirana, but unfortunately it was discovered that the pair were related. Kepala departed to Dublin Zoo and a new male named Fabi was brought in from Prague Zoo to form a breeding pair of Sumatrans, a critically endangered subspecies in the wild. Kirana and Fabi bred and have so far bred successfully on three occasions since 2011.

The zoo welcomed its first ever cheetah cubs in June 2011. The cheetahs are the vulnerable Sudanese subspecies - a second litter was born in 2013.

===Asian Steppe===
Bactrian camels and onagers in a large paddock in the centre of the zoo, formerly the zebra exhibit. A paddock which was only visible from the monorail but can now be seen from the Bats&#x27; Bridge holds a group of Philippine spotted deer.

===Other exhibits===
Bordering the paddocks is a waterway running north-south along which the water bus formerly travelled, past island groups of white-faced sakis, Alaotran bamboo lemurs and howler monkeys. A variety of callitrichids, including cotton-top tamarins, were formerly housed on the Bamboo lemur Island, whilst the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to black-and-white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge was previously home to lowland anoa and is now home to babirusia. In the southeast corner of the zoo are enclosures housing an assortment of animals, including red pandas, Southern pudu, Cabot&#x27;s tragopans and the wetland bird nursery. The former cassowary exhibit next to the anteaters was redeveloped in 2016.

Near the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre is an aviary currently housing spectacled owls that was formerly home to macaws and keas. The remainder of the zoo&#x27;s owl collection are seen nearby. The owl aviaries were recently modified.

==Former exhibits==

===Europe on the Edge===
This was the zoo&#x27;s largest aviary, and was one of the biggest in the UK. It was opened in 1993 on the site of the former polar bear enclosure. It housed a variety of European birds, including European black vultures and griffon vultures, and the rarer of the two European storks, the black stork. Wading birds also featured, including spoonbills, ibises and egrets as well as a selection of waterfowl. Smaller birds included rock doves, northern lapwings, red-legged partridges and the native but rare red-billed chough. It was demolished in 2019 to make way for Madagascar Forest.

==Membership and adoption==
The zoo has a service that gives people the option of adopting an animal of their choice, they are also given two complimentary tickets to allow them to visit the animals. They can also become members which allows them to visit Chester and a range of other zoos across the UK free of charge for a year. The zoo has over 145,000 members. Every three months, members and adopters receive the zoo magazine on line, which provides updates and information about what is happening at the zoo.

==Television==

During summer 2007, television crews from Granada filmed at Chester for the documentary series &quot;Zoo Days&quot;, a behind the scenes look at the day-to-day running of the zoo, narrated by Jane Horrocks. British broadcast rights were sold to Five and the first 20-part series began airing on British terrestrial TV on 8 October 2007, transmitting on weekday evenings in a regular 6:30 pm slot. A second 20-part series of &quot;Zoo Days&quot; was swiftly commissioned and began airing on 3 March 2008. The third 20-part series was broadcast from Colchester Zoo, before returning to Chester for the fourth 20-part series on 10 November 2008.

In 2014 the zoo was the subject of BBC One drama &quot;Our Zoo&quot;, telling the story of the founding of Chester Zoo by the Mottershead family in the 1930s and featured Lee Ingleby as George Mottershead. During the six-part series, the show reached audiences in excess of five million viewers and was nominated for two national TV awards.

In January 2016, Channel 4 began broadcasting a six-part series, &quot;The Secret Life of the Zoo&quot;, following the keepers and animals at Chester Zoo and narrated by Olivia Colman from Series 1 to 5 and Tamsin Grieg since Series 6. The first series was a ratings success and was recommissioned for a second series. Series 2 aired at the end of 2016. The show has now run for ten seasons with a compilation series in 2020.

<text>Akhalkalaki (; ) is a town in Georgia&#x27;s southern region of Samtskhe–Javakheti and the administrative centre of the Akhalkalaki Municipality. Akhalkalaki lies on the edge of the Javakheti Plateau. The city is located about from the border with Armenia. The town&#x27;s recorded history goes back to the 11th century. As of the 2014 Georgian census the town had a population of 8,295, with 93.8% Armenian majority.

== Etymology ==
The name Akhalkalaki, first recorded in the 11th-century Georgian chronicle, means &quot;a new town&quot;, from Georgian , &quot;new&quot;, and , &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot;. The 19th-century ethnographic accounts have another Armenian name for the town, Nor-Kaghak, also meaning &quot;a new town&quot;.

==History==
Akhalkalaki was founded by Bagrat IV of Georgia in 1064. In 1066, the city was destroyed during the Seljuq invasions of the Kingdom of Georgia. In the 11th century, Akhalkalaki became one of the political and economical centres of Javakheti. In the 16th century, the city came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and became a sanjak centre in Çıldır Eyaleti. Under the Ottoman rule, the town was known as &quot;Ahılkelek&quot;. The city was passed from the Ottomans to the Russians after the Russo-Turkish War in 1828–1829. On January 4, 1900, an earthquake destroyed much of the town and killed 1,000 people in the area. The citizens predominantly dwelled in dugouts till the 1920s. The city was the administrative center of the Akhalkalaki uezd of the Tiflis Governorate. In May 1918, the town and its district were occupied by the Ottoman army until their withdrawal by the Armistice of Mudros—the occupation resulted in the exodus of the local Armenian population which nearly perished due to starvation and disease.

==Population==

By the time of the region&#x27;s annexation to the Russian Empire in 1829, the population was mainly Islamicized Georgians. After the Russian takeover, most of the Muslim Georgians left the area for the Ottoman Empire, and in their place Christian Armenian refugees from Erzurum and Bayazid settled here. Since then the city and the region of Javakheti has been largely populated by Armenians.

== Climate ==
The climate of Akhalkalaki is moderately humid with relative cold dry winters and long cool summers. (&quot;Köppen:&quot; Dfb)

== Transport ==

The crossroads village meets from south the streets from the border to Armenia and Turkey, from north to Borjomi–Gori and east–west from Batumi to Tiflis south of the Lesser Caucasus.

A long railway line was constructed between 1982 and 1986 in three parts. The junction from the line Tbilisi–Yerevan is in Marabda.

In April 2005, an agreement was signed to build a new railway connecting Turkey with Georgia and Azerbaijan, passing nearby Akhalkalaki. This would bypass an existing line through Gyumri in Armenia which has been closed by Turkey, blockading Armenia, for political reasons since the 1990s. The railway became operational on October 30, 2017. It is here where the break-of-gauge is.

In compound with the military base was constructed an airport. With military dismantling it was closed.

== Bases ==

The city was home to the Soviet-era 147th Motor Rifle Division (part of the 9th Army of the Transcaucasian Military District) up until the early 1990s. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Division became the Russian 62nd Military Base. It was officially transferred, according to the Sochi agreement, to Georgia on June 27, 2007.

On September 19, 2020, a new basic combat training center was opened on the site of the former base in Akhalkalaki. The center is designed to accommodate and train up to 800 military personnel and conscripts.

<text>Spirogyra (common names include water silk, mermaid&#x27;s tresses, and blanket weed) is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales, named for the helical or spiral arrangement of the chloroplasts that is characteristic of the genus. &quot;Spirogyra&quot; species, of which there are more than 500, are commonly found in freshwater habitats. &quot;Spirogyra&quot; measures approximately 10 to 150 micrometres in width (though not usually more that 60) and may grow to several centimetres in length.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Spirogyra&quot; can be been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. It is freshwater algae, found rivers, ponds, and other such bodies of water.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus Spirogyra was named by German naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1820. The lectotype, &quot;Spirogyra&quot; &quot;porticalis&quot; was designated in 1952 by Paul C. Silvia.

==Reproduction==

&quot;Spirogyra&quot; can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In vegetative reproduction, fragmentation takes place, and &quot;Spirogyra&quot; simply undergoes intercalary cell division to extend the length of the new filaments.

Sexual reproduction is of two types:
# Scalariform conjugation requires association of two or more different filaments lined side by side, either partially or throughout their length. One cell each from opposite lined filaments emits tubular protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which elongate and fuse to make a passage called the conjugation canal. The cytoplasm of the cell acting as the male travels through this tube and fuses with the female cytoplasm, and the gametes fuse to form a zygospore. 
# In lateral conjugation, gametes are formed in a single filament. Two adjoining cells near the common transverse wall give out protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which further form the conjugation canal upon contact. The male cytoplasm migrates through the conjugation canal, fusing with the female. The rest of the process proceeds as in scalariform conjugation.

The essential difference is that scalariform conjugation occurs between two filaments and lateral conjugation occurs between two adjacent cells on the same filament.

== Usage ==
Spirogyra species are being researched for their potential in bioremediation. Specifically, in stemming toxic runoff from mines (where they are often found occurring naturally) and from municipal wastewater. Spirogyra has also been investigated as a potential biofuel.

&quot;Spirogyra&quot; species, such as &quot;S. varians,&quot; are also being researched for potential pharmaceutical usage due to their high nutrient densities.

<text>Percy Hodge (26 December 1890 – 27 December 1967) was a British athlete, winner of the 3000 m steeplechase at the 1920 Summer Olympics.

== Career ==
Hodge was born in Guernsey, but then moved to Weymouth and Bournemouth, finally settling in Bexhill-on-Sea. He became the National 2 miles steeplechase champion after winning the AAA Championships title at the 1919 AAA Championships. 

The following year in 1920, he retained his AAA title despite his shoe fallling off in the second lap causing him to stop and lose some 100 yards, yet he won the race by a margin of 75 yards. He also finished ninth at the International Cross Country Championships and helped his team to win a first place in 1920. Shortly after he was selected for the Olympic Games. The 1920 Summer Olympics were the first to include a (now common) 3000 m steeplechase. This was run on a grass course, unlike later competitions. Percy Hodge was the favourite, easily winning his heat and outrunning the rest of the field. He won the final in a time of 10:00.4, some 100 m ahead of second-placed Patrick Flynn from the United States. Hodge also ran in the heats of the 3000 m team event, in which Great Britain won a silver medal. 

Hodge retained his AAA title again in 1921 and 1923.

<text>Project stakeholders are persons or entities who have an interest in a specific project. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), the term &quot;project stakeholder&quot; refers to &quot;an individual, group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project, program, or portfolio. ISO 21500 uses a similar definition.

==Types of stakeholders==
Stakeholders may be located inside or outside an organization, including:
# The project&#x27;s sponsor;
# Those with an interest or the potential to gain from the successful completion of a project;
# Anyone who may have a positive or negative influence in the project completion.

The following are examples of project stakeholders:
* Project leader
* Senior management
* Project team members
* Project customer
* Community Served or the Community that is being Served (example of a stakeholder affected by a non-profit organization or government agency)
* Resource managers
* Line managers
* Product user group
* Project testers
* Any group impacted by the project as it progresses
* Any group impacted by the project when it is completed
* Subcontractors to the project
* Consultants to the project

==Stakeholder management==
By the beginning of the 21st century, stakeholders have been considered more and more as the crucial human factor that defines the perception of success of a project, particularly the beneficiaries of the project&#x27;s outcomes. This has increased the focus on stakeholder management within the general topic of project management.

Rather than focusing on one subset of stakeholders, Lynda Bourne advocates prioritizing all stakeholders and focusing your attention on the &quot;most important&quot; at this point in time. Her view of importance encompasses an assessment of the power, proximity and urgency associated with each stakeholder. She calls her methodology a &quot;Stakeholder Circle&quot;.

The rationale for this emphasis on decision makers is part of project stakeholder management and a key component in affecting change in an organization. John Hotter describes stakeholder analysis and stakeholder management as essential components of change management.

<text>Bolan Pass () is a valley and a natural gateway through the Toba Kakar range in Balochistan province of Pakistan. It is situated south of Pakistan&#x27;s border with Afghanistan. The pass is an stretch of the Bolan River valley from Rindli in the south to Darwāza near Kolpur in the north. It is made up of a number of narrow gorges and stretches. It connects Quetta with Sibi by road and railway.

Being strategically located, it has also been used by traders, invaders, and nomadic tribes as a gateway to and from South Asia. The Bolān Pass is an important pass on the Baluch frontier, connecting Jacobabad and Jhang with Multan, which has always occupied an important place in the history of British campaigns in Afghanistan.

The local population south of the pass predominantly consists of Brahvi tribes, who extend from Bolan Pass to Cape Monze on the Arabian Sea. The ethnic group north of the pass consists of mainly Pashtuns, while to west, Balochis.

==Geography==
The Bolan Pass is in the Toba Kakar range which lies south of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. Bolan Pass is described as a pass over a lofty range that is full of ravines and gorges. The mountain ranges of the Bolan pass are the southern geographic border between the Indian Plate and the Iranian plateau. The southern point of the pass, near Dhadar, is the western bound of the Indus Valley and is seen as a great strategic point between Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and the Arabian Sea.

== History ==

The Bolan pass is the southern counterpart of the Khyber Pass. Both ranges have been used throughout history for invasions of the Indian subcontinent. In 1748, the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded India by using the Bolan Pass in addition to the traditional Khyber Pass route. The Durrani capital Qandahar was located nearby the pass which gave quick access to Indian lands.

In 1837, threatened by a possible Russian invasion of South Asia via the Khyber and Bolān Passes, a British envoy was sent to Kabul to gain support of the Emir, Dost Mohammed. In February 1839, during the First Anglo-Afghan War, the British Army under Sir John Keane took 12,000 men through the Bolān Pass and entered Qandahar, which the Afghan princes had abandoned; from there they would go on to attack and overthrow Ghazni.The pass they chose was not the same as that used by the modern railway line, but further west at Siri-Bolan.
A British officer of the Bengal Artillery described the Bolan Pass in 1841 in these words:
&quot;The road through this pass leads, with few and rare exceptions, along what is the bed of a mountain-torrent, when filled by the melting of the snows or heavy rains, and is composed of loose shingly gravel, that recedes from under your feet, and is very difficult for draught: camels get on well. It is infested by the Kakurs, who live by robbery; and the hills sometimes close in upon the road, which is filled up by the bed of the stream, running through rocky chasms, upwards of a hundred feet high, from the top of which the robbers assail the travellers with stones; and were they as bold as they are cruel and perfidious, they might hold the place against all comers. Many spots were pointed out to me by the guides I had with me, as signalised by acts of violence, several European officers having lost their baggage during our occupation of the country. Should there be rain in the higher parts of the mountains, the stream at times comes down in an almost perpendicular volume, without warning, and sweeping all before it, as a friend of mine experienced, when he saw a party of men, horses, and camels, and all his property, borne down by it; when himself and some few men with him escaped by climbing up the nearly perpendicular side of the hill. About thirty-seven men were washed away upon that occasion.&quot;

In 1883, Sir Robert Groves Sandeman negotiated with the Khan of Kalat, Khudadad Khan, and secured British control over the pass in exchange for an annual fee.

== Bolan Pass railway ==

From Sibi, the line runs south-west, skirting the hills to Rindli and originally followed the course of the Bolan stream to its head on the plateau. The destructive action of floods, however, led to the abandonment of this alignment, and the railway now follows the Mashkaf valley (which debouches into the plains close to Sibi), and is carried from near the head of the Mashkaf to a junction with the Bolan at Machh. An alternative route from Sibi to Quetta was found in the Harnai valley to the N.E. of Sibi, the line starting in exactly the opposite direction to that of the Bolān and entering the hills at Nari. Originally the Harnai route, although longer, was the one adopted for ordinary traffic, the Bolan loop being reserved for emergencies. However, the route suffered regularly from floods and land slips. Hence the Bolan route was upgraded in 1895 to handle all traffic with the Harnai route kept for local traffic. In 1942 floods destroyed a large part of the line and all through running ceased. By 1943 all bridges and track between Khost and Bostan had been recovered. At this time (2024) the line from Sibi to Khost still exists but is out of Service. At the Khundilani gorge of the Bolan route conglomerate cliffs which rise to a height of , enclose the valley. At Siri Bolan the passage between the limestone rocks hardly admits of three persons riding abreast. The temperature of the pass in summer is extremely high. In winter, it is the extremely cold, and the ice-cold wind rushing down the narrow outlet becomes destructive to life. Since 1877, when the Quetta agency was founded, the pass was secured by the British Indian Army from militias of Baloch tribesmen (chiefly Marris).

<text>Sir Charles Ridley Pawsey (14 July 1894 – 21 July 1972) was a British colonial administrator.

==Biography==
Pawsey was born in Surbiton, Surrey, the second son of Charles James Pawsey and Ellen Edith Pawsey. His father was Paymaster In Chief of the Royal Navy. He was educated at Berkhamsted School and Wadham College, Oxford where he graduated with a BA. He was commissioned into the Worcestershire Regiment in 1914 and won the Military Cross as a second lieutenant (temporary Lieutenant) in 1916 and bar as a second lieutenant (temporary captain) the next year. He was promoted captain in 1917 and relinquished his Territorial Army commission on 30 September 1921.

Pawsey joined the Indian Civil Service in 1919. He was appointed Assistant Commissioner in Assam in 1919, becoming Director of Land Records in 1932. He was made a Deputy Commissioner in 1935 and was District Commissioner, Naga Hills during the Burma campaigns of 1942 to 1944. Pawsey&#x27;s bungalow and tennis court were the place where the British Fourteenth Army finally turned the tide of the war against the Japanese during the Burma Campaign of World War II at the Battle of Kohima. The part of this battle centred on his bungalow was known as the Battle of the Tennis Court. Showing great bravery and loyalty to the local Naga people, Pawsey refused to leave Kohima during the siege by the Japanese that lasted from 5th to 20th April 1944, and did what he could to bolster morale and support Colonel Richards the garrison commander. The Nagas remained completely loyal to him and by way of thanks their tribal leaders were introduced to Lord Mountbatten at Kohima in August 1944.

Prior to his return to Britain following India&#x27;s independence, Pawsey wrote in the &quot;Naga Nation&quot;, underlining that autonomy within the Indian Union was the more prudent course to follow. For, &quot;Independence will mean: tribal warfare, no hospitals, no schools, no salt, no trade with the plains and general unhappiness&quot;. He was knighted on 14 August 1947, (part of the 1948 New Year Honours) and he retired 1948. In his later years, he lived at The Priory, Badingham, Woodbridge, Suffolk until his death on 21 July 1972.

==Family==
In 1954, when he was about 60 years old, Sir Charles married Rita, the widow of Hugh Ingle Halliday.
