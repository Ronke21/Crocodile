<text>Robert Fabyan (died 1512) was a London draper, Sheriff and Alderman, and author of &quot;Fabyan&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;.

==Family==
Robert Fabyan was the son of John Fabyan and his wife, Agnes. He is said to have been born in London. He had a brother, John. His nephew, John Fabyan, married Anne Waldegrave, by whom he had a daughter, Mary Fabian, wife of Sir Thomas Spert.

==Career==

He was apprenticed as a draper to William Holme about 1470, and was granted the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Drapers in 1476. In 1485 he served as renter warden of the Drapers, and in 1486 as auditor of the accounts of the City of London. In 1493 he was elected Sheriff, and in the following year as alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without. In 1495 he was elected Master of the Drapers, and in 1496 was chosen to petition Henry VII on behalf of the Company with respect to the levies on cloth exported from England to Flanders. During the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 Fabyan, John Brooke and John Warner were charged with securing Ludgate and Newgate. After the suppression of the rebellion they travelled with the King to Woodstock. In 1498 he was one of the assessors of a subsidy levied to finance the war in Scotland. In 1501 he was again elected Master of the Drapers. In 1503 he resigned his office of alderman on the ground that he lacked the financial resources to support election as Lord Mayor.

He is best known as the author of the work commonly known as &quot;Fabyan&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, which presents &#x27;parallel histories of England and France&#x27;, and covers the period from the arrival of the legendary Brutus of Troy in England to the death of Henry VII. Two manuscripts are extant (Holkham Hall, MS 671, and BL, Cotton MS Nero C.xi), and although these are not in Fabyan&#x27;s hand, it is almost certain that the text is his. The chronicle was initially printed without attribution by Richard Pynson in 1516 as &quot;The New Chronicles of England and France&quot;, but an edition of 1533 printed by William Rastell bore Fabyan&#x27;s name on the title page: . Both John Bale and John Stow described the chronicle as Fabyan&#x27;s work, although according to McLaren, Stow also wrongly attributes to him the manuscript of the &quot;Great Chronicle&quot; (London, Guildhall Library, MS 3313), likely because both Fabyan&#x27;s Chronicle and the Great Chronicle are written (or copied) in the same hand.

A continuation in 1509 appears also to be attributable to Fabyan, and includes events personally witnessed by him, such as the arrest in 1468 of Thomas Cooke, a prominent merchant in London, and the arrival in England in 1502 of three men, inhabitants of Newfoundland, &#x27;whom the King kept a time after&#x27;.

Fabyan was the first London chronicler to cite his sources, which included &quot;The Brut&quot;, Bede, William of Malmesbury, Ranulf Higden, Henry of Huntingdon and numerous others, as well as records of the City of London. John Bale claimed that the 1516 edition was burned by Cardinal Wolsey. The second edition of 1533 was printed after Wolsey&#x27;s death, and was followed by editions in 1542 and 1559. Henry Ellis edited a modern edition in 1811.

Fabyan was executor of the will of his father-in-law, and through his wife inherited a house called Halstedys together with other lands in Theydon Garnon, Essex. At his death he also owned tenements in the London parishes of St Benet Fink and St Michael&#x27;s, Cornhill, as well as lands and tenements in East Ham, West Ham, Leyton and other towns in Essex.

Stow states that Fabyan died in 1511, while Bale dates his death to 25 February 1512. Stow also records that he was buried at St Michael&#x27;s Cornhill, where his monument is no longer extant, although Stow preserved the English part of his epitaph. In his will, proved 12 July 1513, he left bequests to his wife, his six surviving children, his cousin, Dorothy, and the mercer Robert Tate, Lord Mayor of London, among others.

==Marriage and issue==
Fabyan married Elizabeth Pake, daughter and heir of a London draper, John Pake, by Elizabeth Stokker, by whom he had sixteen children, only six of whom, four sons, John, Robert, Thomas, and Anthony, and two daughters, Joan Haryat and Mary, were alive at his death.

Ellis notes that a John Fabyan, in his will dated 16 March 1541, mentions &#x27;the Lady Spert&#x27; (see above) as his sister, and refers to the Earl of Southampton as his master. He also mentions another sister, Martha, to whom he bequeaths four nobles yearly, and the Lady Marney, to whom he bequeaths his books of meditation and his chronicles. McLaren suggest that this might be the will of &#x27;a grandson of Robert&#x27;; however Baldwin&#x27;s statement that Robert Fabyan had a nephew, John Fabyan, whose daughter Mary married Sir Thomas Spert (see above), suggests that the 1541 will was the will of the son of Robert Fabyan&#x27;s nephew.

<text>Edward Fairfax (c. 1580 – 27 January 1635) was an English translator. He translated Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;. He also wrote an original work on demonology.

==Life==
He was the natural son of Sir Thomas Fairfax the elder, of Denton in Yorkshire, and a half-brother of Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1560–1640). Fairfax lived at New Hall, Fewston, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, England.

He is best known for his translation of Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, considered a masterpiece. It is one of the comparatively few translations which in themselves are literature and was highly praised by John Dryden. The first edition appeared in 1600, and was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth I of England. Fairfax also wrote a treatise on demonology, in which he was a devout believer.

Edward&#x27;s daughters Elizabeth and Anne were baptised in the village church of Fewston in 1606 and 1621 respectively.

<doc id="1002166" wikidata="Q127226" url="?curid=1002166" title="William Falconer (poet)">
<text>William Falconer (21 February 1732 – c. January 1770) was a Scottish epic poet concerned mainly with life at sea. He also compiled a dictionary of maritime terms.

==&quot;Life&quot;==
Falconer was the son of a barber in Edinburgh, where he was born. He became a sailor, and thereby competent to describe the management of a storm-tossed vessel, whose career and fate are told in his poem, &quot;The Shipwreck&quot; (1762), a work of genuine, if unequal talent. The efforts Falconer made to improve the poem in a later edition were not wholly successful.

The work won him the patronage of the Duke of York, through whose influence he was appointed purser on various warships. He had himself been one of three survivors of a trading ship on a voyage from Alexandria to Venice.

In 1751 Falconer produced a poem on the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. He had also contributed poems to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Shipwreck&quot; was dedicated to the then rear-admiral the Duke of York.

Falconer was briefly a midshipman on the &quot;Royal George&quot;, then in 1763 he became purser of the frigate &quot;Glory&quot;, aboard which he wrote the political satire &quot;Demagogue.&quot; In 1767 he was purser of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. In 1769 he published &quot;An Universal Dictionary of the Marine&quot;.

William Falconer was a passenger in the frigate &quot;Aurora&quot; when it was lost at sea on a voyage to India. He was last seen on 24 December 1769.

==Later borrowings==
Falconer&#x27;s poems were used by Patrick O&#x27;Brian in his Aubrey-Maturin series. One of his lesser characters is a nautical poet, but his poems are Falconer&#x27;s.

The lines &quot;With living colours give my verse to glow:/The sad memorial of a tale of woe!&quot;, from &quot;The Shipwreck&quot;, Canto I, appeared as a motto for &quot;Tafereel van de overwintering der Hollanders op Nova Zembla in de jaren 1596 en 1597&quot; (1820), by the Dutch poet Hendrik Tollens (1780–1856).

<doc id="1002170" wikidata="Q7763197" url="?curid=1002170" title="The Secrets of the Self">
<text>Asrar-i-Khudi (, The Secrets of the Self; published in Persian, 1915) was the first philosophical poetry book of Allama Iqbal. This book deals mainly with the individual, while his second book &quot;Rumuz-i-Bekhudi&quot; discusses the interaction between the individual and society.

==Introduction==
Published in 1915, &quot;Asrar-i-Khudi&quot; (Secrets of the Self) was the first poetry book of Iqbal. Considered by many to be Iqbal&#x27;s best book of poetry, it is concerned with the philosophy of religion. In a letter to the poet Ghulam Qadir Girami (d.1345/1927), Iqbal wrote, &quot;The ideas behind the verses had never been expressed before either in the East or in the West.&quot; R.A. Nicholson, who translated the Asrar as&quot; The Secrets of the Self&quot;, says it caught the attention of young Muslims as soon as it was printed. Iqbal wrote this in Persian because he felt the language was well-suited for the expression of these ideas.

==Overview==
In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the &quot;Asrar-e-Khudi&quot; (&quot;Secrets of the Self&quot;) in Persian. The poems emphasize the spirit and self from a religious, spiritual perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal&#x27;s finest poetic work 

In &quot;Asrar-e-Khudi&quot;, Iqbal has explained his philosophy of &quot;Khudi,&quot; or &quot;Self.&quot; Iqbal&#x27; s use of term &quot;Khudi&quot; is synonymous with the word of &quot;Rooh&quot; as mentioned in the Quran. &quot;Rooh&quot; is that divine spark which is present in every human being and was present in Adam for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam. 

However, one has to make a great journey of transformation to realize that divine spark which Iqbal calls &quot;Khudi&quot;. A similitude of this journey could be understood by the relationship of fragrance and seed. Every seed has the potential for fragrance within it. But to reach its fragrance the seed must go through all the different changes and stages. First breaking out of its shell. Then breaking the ground to come into the light developing roots at the same time. Then fighting against the elements to develop leaves and flowers. Finally reaching its pinnacle by attaining the fragrance that was hidden within it. 

In the same way, to reach one&#x27;s khudi or rooh one needs to go through multiple stages which Iqbal himself went through, spiritual path which he encourages others to travel. He notes that not all seeds reach the level of fragrance. Many die along the way, incomplete. In the same way, only few people could climb this Mount Everest of spirituality, most get consumed along the way by materialism. The same concept had been used by the medieval poet and philosopher Farid ud-Din Attar of Nishapur in his &quot;Mantaq-ul-Tair&quot; (&quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;). 

Iqbal proves by various means that the whole universe obeys the will of the &quot;Self.&quot; He condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the &quot;Self&quot; has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the &quot;Self&quot; to become the vicegerent of God.

<text>Catherine Maria Fanshawe (1765–1834) was an English poet whose work was praised by Walter Scott. She and her sisters were also artists.

==Biography==
Catherine Maria Fanshawe was born at Shabden in Chipstead, Surrey, 1765. She was the daughter of John Fanshawe (1738–1816), a Surrey squire, and his wife Penelope (&quot;née&quot; Dredge). Fanshawe&#x27;s father held a post in the household of King George III.

After the father&#x27;s death in 1816, Fanshawe and her two sisters were co-heirs. They lived at 15 Berkeley Square, London, and at Midhurst House, Richmond, Surrey, but also visited Italy due to their poor health.

Fanshawe died after a long illness at Putney Heath, then in Surrey, on 17 April 1834.

==Work==
Fanshawe wrote clever occasional verse after the Romantic school. Some of her poems were printed in publications by Joanna Baillie and Mary Russell Mitford in 1823 and 1859, then together in 1865 and 1876. Mitford described her as &quot;admirable as a letter-writer, as a reader of Shakespeare, and as a designer in almost every style.&quot; Her poems &quot;sparkle with irony. She mimics political voices she disagrees with.&quot; The diary she kept has not been found. Fanshawe&#x27;s best-known production is the famous &quot;Riddle on the Letter H&quot;, beginning &quot;&#x27;Twas whispered in heaven and &#x27;twas muttered in hell,&quot; which has often been attributed to Byron. Her &quot;Fragment in Imitation of Wordsworth&quot; appears in the &quot;Oxford Book of Parodies&quot; (edited by John Gross).

Walter Scott admired her poetry as &quot;quite beautiful&quot;. He also related that Catherine and her sisters were the first publishers of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Ann, Lady Fanshawe (1625–1680), which cover her life up to 1672 and were completed in 1676. These appeared in 1829.

<doc id="1002172" wikidata="Q1638627" url="?curid=1002172" title="History of Brittany">
<text>The history of Brittany may refer to the entire history of the Armorican peninsula or only to the creation and development of a specifically Brythonic culture and state in the Early Middle Ages and the subsequent history of that state.

Pre-Brythonic Armorica includes the ancient megalith cultures in the area and the Celtic tribal territories that existed before Roman rule. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, large scale migration from the British Isles led to the foundation of British colonies linked initially to homelands in Cornwall, Devon, and Wales. The various independent petty Breton states later developed into a Kingdom and then a Duchy of Brittany, before it was unified with France to become a province. After the French Revolution Brittany was abolished as an administrative unit, but continued to retain its distinctive cultural identity. Its administrative existence was reconstituted, in reduced size, as the Region of Brittany in the mid-20th century.

The history of Brittany begins with settlement beginning in prehistoric times. The neolithic era, which began around 5000 BCE, is characterised in the region by the development of an important megalithic art found in sites such as the cairn of Barnenez, the cairn of Gavrinis, the table of the Merchants of Locmariaquer or the alignments of Carnac. In the course of its protohistory which began around the middle of the third century BCE, a subsoil rich in tin allowed the development of an industry in bronze objects, which led to commercial routes for export to other regions of Europe. It was inhabited by Gallic peoples including the Veneti and the Namnetes in the first centuries BCE before these territories were conquered by Julius Caesar in 57 BCE, and progressively Romanized.

As part of Armorica since the Gallo-Roman period, Brittany developed an important maritime trade network near the ports of Nantes, Vannes, and Alet, as well as salting factories along its coasts. When Rome encountered crises in the third and fifth centuries, the first wave of island Bretons were asked by the imperial power to help secure their territory, beginning with a migratory movement that was carried out until the sixth century, and saw the beginnings of many kingdoms in the peninsula.

In order to prevent Breton incursion, the neighbouring Frankish kingdom created a Breton borderland incorporating the counties of Rennes and Nantes. From the sixth to ninth centuries however, the Merovingian dynasty and the Carolingian dynasty tried to integrate the region into the Frankish kingdom, with limited and ephemeral success.

The union of the country as Brittany occurred in 851 under King Erispoë, son of Nominoë, but was disrupted by disputes over succession and Norsemen incursions. Since 939, Brittany was re-established as a Sovereign Duchy with somewhat definite borders, administered by Dukes of Breton houses from 939 to 1166, before falling into the sphere of influence of the Plantagenets and then the Capets. The War of the Breton Succession lasted from 1341 to 1364 against the backdrop of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. An autonomous power emerged in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, maintaining a policy of independence from France. The union of Brittany to France occurred in 1532.

The Breton province then maintained relative autonomy and benefited from its own institutions. After a period of strong economic and demographic growth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, due to a period of newfound peace, Brittany experienced a troubled period from the end of the seventeenth century to the French Revolution of 1789. Brittany was dissolved in 1789 and divided among the departments of Côtes-du-Nord, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine, Loire-Inférieure and Morbihan.

After a long nineteenth century marked by a modernization of agriculture and by huge increases in population, an emigration to the rest of France began. Although a traditionally conservative region, Brittany saw the rise of workers&#x27; movements in cities such as Brest, Lorient and Saint-Nazaire.

The First World War was an important turning point for Bretons, who discovered new ways of life, which some would seek to integrate little by little. The question of the proper place for the Breton language and regional traditions became the central element of a political movement which began to emerge in the same era. A long process of modernization took place from the 1920s through the 1970s, in concert with a movement of cultural reaffirmation.

== Prehistory of Brittany ==
=== Stone Age ===

==== Paleolithic ====
The Paleolithic period of Brittany ranges from 700 000 to 10 000 years BC. Traces of the oldest industries were found in the middle valley of the Vilaine river, identified as pebbles arranged in a quarry in Saint-Malo-de-Phily. The oldest traces of habitat are located in Saint-Colomban, in Carnac, and take the form of settlements built in natural shelters (cliffs created by the erosion along the coasts). In addition to pebbles, bifaces are found there, and the site dates to 300,000 BC. J.-C. Acheulian bifacials from this period are found along the sea coast, as Treguennec, Hôpital-Camfrout or Pléneuf. The oldest traces of fire use (in the region but also of occidental Europe) are found on the site of Menez Dregan with a date making them up to 400 000 years BC. The few human groups are then made of hunter-gatherers.

From the Middle-Mousterian period, remain two outstanding sites in the region, in Mont-Dol where scrapers were found in a site dated to 70,000 BC., as well as at Goaréva on the island of Bréhat.

The Upper Paleolithic is characterized by refined tools like blades and lamellae found on the site of Beg-ar-C&#x27;Hastel in Kerlouan, or at Plasenn-al-Lomm on the island of Bréhat. No painted cave is identified in the area, probably because of rising sea levels during the next period. But the nearest cave of this type is known in Saulges. The end of the Palaeolithic period in the region is around 10,000 BC. J.-C.

==== Mesolithic ====
The Mesolithic period covers in the region a period from 10,000 BC. to 5000 BC., corresponding to the end of the last Ice Age and the resulting rise in water level. Steppe vegetation is replaced by a vegetation of birch and pine, and hazel, oak and elms; large mammals give way to animals of smaller size as deer or wild boar. For a time, hunting and gathering continue, as well as fishing and foraging. By the time of the Neolithic, however, animal domestication and cereal production replace hunting. The population is mainly coastal and larger on the south coast. The skeletons found from this period attest to an average size of 1.59 meters for men and 1.52 m for women.

Human technology continues to progress with a reduction in size of stone tools to form microliths. Human societies are more structured, with a degree of specialization of activities in a given community (as indicated by studies of the Téviec burial site) and the beginning of an artistic expression. Traces of deaths caused by tools like arrows are also visible on some skeletons, attesting to sometimes violent conflicts between different communities.

==== Neolithic ====
The Neolithic period (stretching from 5000 BC to 2000 BC.) saw the arrival of an agriculture based on slash-and-burn: land is reclaimed from the forest after having fired and is then used for breeding before sprinkling grass. This evolution was made possible by the development of methods of extracting stones and their shaping. In a quarry in Plussulien, about 5000 dolerite axes were extracted per year, representing 40% of the axes of the Breton peninsula. The dissemination of these tools stretched to Paris basin, and 10 copies of these axes were found to Belgium and southern England. The region also imported yellow blond flint blades from Touraine.

This period is also notable for the development of megalithic monuments, helped by a significant economic growth. Two of the most ancient sites, the mound of Barnenez and the Petit-Mont, whose buildings date back to 5000 BC., evidenced by their similarities to a unity of culture in the peninsula. This type of construction will eventually evolve and provide more regional variants. In these burial sites were found engravings similar to those observed in Irish sites like Newgrange.

Besides these barrows are also present menhirs, the highest known being in the Leon region where the largest, that of Kerloas, rises to 9.50 m. The largest ever erected is located in South Brittany in Locmariaquer: the Locmariaquer megaliths amounting to 18.5 m. Engravings can also be found there and their functions are multiple: Indicator of burials, astronomical and topographic features, or reflecting a water worship. The last menhirs were raised around 1800-1500 BC. They can be combined in single or multiple rows, or in semicircles or circles.

=== Protohistory ===

====Iron Age====

A variety of tribes are mentioned in Roman sources, like the Veneti, Armoricani, Osismii, Namnetes and Coriosolites. Strabo and Poseidonius describe the Armoricani as belonging to the Belgae.

Armorican gold coins have been widely exported and are even found in the Rhineland.

Salterns are widespread in Northern Armorica, for example at Trégor, Ebihens and Enez Vihan near Pleumeur-Bodou (Côtes-d&#x27;Armor) and the island of Yoc&#x27;h near Landuvez (Finistère) of late La Tène date.

An estimated 40–55 kg of salt per oven were produced at Ebihens. Each oven was about 2 m long. The site dates to the end of the early La Tène or the middle La Tène period. Numerous briquetage remains have been found. At Tregor, &quot;boudins de Calage&quot; (hand-bricks) were the typical form of briquetage, between 2.5 and 15 cm long and with a diameter of 4–7 cm.
At the salterns at Landrellec and Enez Vihan at Pleumeur-Bodou the remains of rectangular ovens have been excavated that are 2.5–3 m long and about 1 m wide, constructed of stones and clay.
On the Gulf of Morbihan about 50 salterns have been found so far, mainly dating to the final La Téne period.

==Roman rule==

In 56 BC the area was conquered by the Romans under Julius Caesar. The main resistance came from the Veneti. After their defeat their leaders were killed and the tribe sold as slaves. The Romans called the district &quot;Armorica&quot; (a Latinisation of a Celtic word meaning &quot;coastal region&quot;), part of the &quot;Gallia Lugdunensis&quot; province. The modern &quot;département&quot; of Côtes-d&#x27;Armor has taken up the ancient name. After the reforms of Diocletian, it was part of the &quot;diocesis Galliarum&quot;.

The uprising of the Bagaudae in the 3rd century led to unrest and depopulation, numerous villages were destroyed. Thick layers of black earth in the towns point to urban depopulation as well. The rule of Constantine (307–350) led to a certain renaissance. Numerous coins were minted. At the &quot;tractus Armoricanus&quot;, new forts were built, for example at Brest, Avranches and Le Yaudet. The Notitia Dignitatum (circa 400 AD) mentions a number of local units manning the &quot;Tractus armoricanus et nervicanus&quot;, for example Mauritanian troops in the territory of the Veneti and Osismii. Frankish laeti were present in Rennes. Christianisation is commonly dated to the late fourth century, but material evidence is rare.

==Middle Ages==

===Early Middle Ages===
====Arrival of the Bretons====

In the 380s, a large number of Britons in the Roman army may have been stationed in Armorica. The 9th century Historia Brittonum states that the emperor Magnus Maximus, who withdrew Roman forces from Britania, settled the troops there. Other British and Welsh authors (Nennius and Gildas) mention a second wave of South-Western Britons from Dumnonia, settling in Armorica in the following century to escape the invading Anglo-Saxons and Irish. Modern archaeology supports a two-wave migration.

These Britons gave the region its current name and contributed the Breton language, &quot;Brezhoneg&quot;, a sister language to Welsh and Cornish. (Brittany used to be known in English as &quot;Little Britain&quot; to distinguish it from Great Britain.)

Conan Meriadoc, the mythic founder of the house of Rohan, is mentioned by medieval Welsh sources as having led the settlement of Brittany by mercenaries serving Maximus. The Welsh text &quot;The Dream of Maxen&quot;, which contains semi-factual information about the usurpation of Maximus, states that they married native women after cutting out their tongues to preserve the purity of their language. This can be interpreted as a legend formulated in order to explain the Welsh (Brythonic) name for Brittany, &quot;Llydaw&quot;, as originating from &quot;lled-taw&quot; or &quot;half-silent&quot;. In fact, the term &quot;Llydaw&quot; or &quot;Ledav&quot; in early Breton probably derives from the Celtic name Litavis.

There are numerous records of missionaries migrating from Britania during the second wave, especially the seven founder-saints of Brittany and Saint Gildas. Many Breton towns are named for these early saints. The Irish saint Colombanus also evangelised Brittany, commemorated at Saint-Columban in Carnac.

The earliest text known in the Breton language, a botanical treatise, dates from 590 (for comparison, the earliest text in French dates from 843). Most of the early Breton language medieval manuscripts were lost during the Viking invasions.

====The petty kingdoms====
In the Early Middle Ages, Brittany was divided into three kingdoms – Domnonia (Devnent), Cornouaille (Kernev), and Bro Waroc&#x27;h (Broërec) – which eventually were incorporated into the larger Breton state. The first two kingdoms derive their names from the homelands of the migrating Britons (Devon and Cornwall). Bro Waroc&#x27;h (&quot;land of Waroch&quot;) derives from the name of one of the first known Breton rulers, who dominated the region of Vannes (Gwened). The rulers of Domnonia such as Conomor sought to expand their territory (including holdings in British Devon and Cornwall), claiming overlordship over all Bretons, though there was constant tension between local lords.

===Resistance to outside rule===
During the 9th century the Bretons resisted incorporation into the Frankish Carolingian Empire. The first unified Duchy of Brittany was founded by Nominoe. The Bretons made friendly overtures to the Danish Vikings to help contain Frankish expansionist ideas.

When the Carolingian empire was divided in 843, Nominoe took advantage of the confusion to consolidate his territory. In alliance with Lambert II of Nantes and the Viking warlord Hastein, Nominoe&#x27;s son Erispoe defeated the Franks at the Battle of Messac. In 845 the Breton army under Nominoe defeated the forces of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia (France), at the Battle of Ballon, in the eastern part of Brittany near Redon and the Frankish border. Nominoe gained control over the major towns of Rennes and Nantes, which had previously formed part of the Frankish border zone known as the &quot;Breton March&quot;.

Control over Rennes, Nantes and the Pays de Retz was secured when the Frankish army was defeated once again in 851 at the Battle of Jengland by the Bretons under Erispoe; consequently Charles the Bald recognised the independence of Brittany and determined the borders that defined the historic duchy and later province. Under Erispoe&#x27;s successor Salomon, Hastein&#x27;s Vikings and the Bretons united as one in 866 to defeat a Frankish army at the Battle of Brissarthe, near modern-day Le Mans. Two Frankish leaders, Robert the Strong and Ranulf, were killed by the Vikings. The Franks were forced to confirm Brittany&#x27;s independence from the Frankish kingdoms and expand Salomon&#x27;s territory. The Vikings tactically helped their Breton allies by making devastating pillaging raids on the Frankish kingdoms. This unfortunately became a double edged sword over the next few decades as the Vikings turned on the Bretons and pillaged Brittany, eventually occupying it. This situation was only overturned with the return of exiled Bretons and an alliance with the Franks. From this point Brittany became a duchy with various levels of fealty to West Francia and eventually France.

===High Middle Ages===

Bretons took part in the Revolt of 1173–1174, siding with the rebels against Henry II of England. Henry&#x27;s son Geoffroy II, then heir apparent to the Duchy of Brittany, resisted his father&#x27;s attempts to annex Brittany to the possessions of the English Crown. Geoffroy&#x27;s son Arthur did likewise during his reign (1186–1203) until his death, perhaps by assassination under King John&#x27;s orders.

In 1185, Geoffroy II signed &quot;Count Geoffrey&#x27;s Assise&quot; which forbade the subdivision of fiefs, thereby reinforcing the Breton feudal system.

After the presumed death of Duke Arthur I, with Arthur&#x27;s full elder sister Eleanor captive under John of England, the Bretons supported Arthur&#x27;s half younger sister Alix instead. King Philip August of France married Alix to the Capetian prince Peter Mauclerc of Dreux, establishing Peter as regent of Alix.

In 1213, with the aim of strengthening his power in Brittany, Philip August introduced Peter as administrator of the duchy and tutor of his son, duke Jehan of Brittany. It was Peter Mauclerc who introduced the use of ermines in the Breton coat of arms and came to espouse the cause of his fief&#x27;s independence with respect to France. While John attempted to regain Brittany in the name of Eleanor, he was defeated in 1214 and finally recognized Alix and Peter. Eleanor ended up in English prison without issue, with her claim never raised ever since.

The 14th and 15th centuries saw the recognition of the distinction between a Gallo-speaking &quot;Britannia gallicana&quot; (now called Upper Brittany) and a Breton-speaking &quot;Britannia britonizans&quot; (now Lower Brittany).

The Breton War of Succession was fought in 1341–1364. The parties were the half-brother of the last duke, John of Montfort (supported by the English), and his niece, Joanna of Penthièvre, who was married to Charles of Blois, nephew of the king of France. This protracted conflict, a component of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, has passed into legend (see for example Combat of the Thirty and Bertrand de Guesclin). Its outcome was decided at the Battle of Auray in 1364, where the House of Montfort was victorious over the French party. After the first Treaty of Guérande, Joanna of Penthièvre abdicated her claims to the dukedom in favour of John the Conqueror. A modified form of Salic law was introduced in Brittany as a result.

In the midst of the conflict, in 1352, the &quot;États de Bretagne&quot; or Estates of Brittany were established. They would develop into the Duchy&#x27;s parlement.
Deserted by his nobles, Duke John IV left for exile in England in 1373. The higher nobility of that time, like the house of Coetmen-Penthièvre, or the house of Rougé, descendants of the former kings of Brittany, strongly supported the Penthièvre side and was nearly extinguished in the repeated fights between Montfort and Penthièvre&#x27;s troops. The king of France, Charles V, named as lieutenant-general of Brittany his brother, the duke of Anjou (also a son-in-law of Joanna de Penthièvre). In 1378, the king of France sought to annex Brittany, which provoked the Bretons to recall John IV from exile. The second Treaty of Guérande (1381) established Brittany&#x27;s neutrality in the Anglo-French conflict, although John continued to swear homage to Charles VI.

In 1420, duke John V was kidnapped by the count of Penthièvre, grandson of Joanna of Penthièvre. John&#x27;s wife, duchess Joanna de France besieged the rebels and set free her husband, who confiscated the Penthièvre&#x27;s goods.

In 1464 the Catholicon, a Breton-Latin-French dictionary by Jehan Lagadeuc, was published. This book was the world&#x27;s first trilingual dictionary, the first Breton dictionary and also the first French dictionary.

The army of the Kingdom of France, with the help of 5,000 mercenaries from Switzerland and Italy, defeated the Breton army in 1488, and the last Duke of independent Brittany, Francis II, was forced to submit to a treaty giving the King of France the right to determine the marriage of the Duke&#x27;s daughter, a 12-year-old girl, the heir to the Duchy. The Duchess Anne was the last independent ruler of the duchy as she was ultimately obliged to marry Louis XII of France. The duchy passed on her death to her daughter Claude, but Claude&#x27;s husband Francis I of France incorporated the duchy into the Kingdom of France in 1532 through the &quot;Edict of Union between Brittany and France&quot;, which was registered with the Estates of Brittany.

==Modern era==

===Early modern period===
After 1532, Brittany retained a certain fiscal and regulatory autonomy, which was defended by the Estates of Brittany despite the rising tide of royal absolutism. Brittany remained on the whole strongly Catholic during the period of the Huguenots and the Wars of Religion, although Protestantism made some headway in Nantes and a few other areas. From 1590 to 1598, during the War of the Catholic League, Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur (governor of Brittany and husband of the countess of Penthièvre) sought to have himself proclaimed Duke of Brittany and allied with Philip II of Spain. The latter, on the other hand, considered establishing his daughter Isabella at the head of a reconstituted Brittany. Henry IV, however, brought Mercœur to an honourable surrender.

During the era of Colbert, Brittany benefited from France&#x27;s naval expansion. Major ports were built or renovated at Saint-Malo, Brest, and Lorient, and Bretons came to constitute a leading component of the French navy. Bretons played an important role in the colonization of New France and the West Indies (&quot;see&quot; French colonisation of the Americas).

In 1675, insurgents in the diocese of Cornouaille and elsewhere rose up in the Revolt of the Bonnets Rouges. The rebels, in contact with Holland, were expecting assistance that never came. Sébastian Ar Balp, the leader of the rebellion, was assassinated by the Marquis de Montgaillard whom Ar Balp was holding prisoner. The rebellion was repressed by the duc de Chaulnes, and hundreds of Bretons were hanged or broken on the wheel. Madame de Sévigné claimed that French soldiers garrisoned in Rennes had roasted a Breton infant on a spit. A whole street in Rennes, suspected of seditiousness, was demolished leaving the inhabitants homeless.

In the conspiracy of Pontcallec of 1720, members of the petty nobility in contact with Spain led a tax revolt against the Régence. The marquis de Pontcallec and three others were tried and executed in Nantes for the uprising.

During the 18th century, Nantes rose to become one of the most important commercial centres of France. The backbone of Nantes&#x27;s prosperity was the Atlantic slave trade.

On 4 August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly in Paris unanimously proclaimed the abolition of feudal privileges. These included the privileges of the provinces such as Brittany. Brittany thus lost the juridical existence, autonomy, Parlement, and administrative, fiscal and legal peculiarities guaranteed since the Edict of Union of 1532. Although the Breton Club (better known as the &quot;Jacobins&quot;) in Paris had initiated the move to abolish feudal distinctions, the decision proved increasingly unpopular in Brittany, where the loss of local autonomy and the increasingly anti-clerical character of the Revolution were resented. Many Bretons took part in the Chouannerie, the royalist insurgency assisted by Great Britain and allied with the revolt in the Vendée. Brittany thus became a hotbed of resistance to the French Revolution.

The territory of Brittany was divided in 1789 into five &quot;départements&quot;, partially on the basis of earlier divisions called &quot;présidiaux&quot; which in turn had issued from medieval &quot;bailliages&quot;.

===Revolutionary period===

Many Bretons, especially members of the merchant class, remained sympathetic to the monarchy during the French Revolution. In 1791, Bretons began to plan a re-establishment of the Estates General of the province, and a return to the estates of the realm system. Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rouërie was a significant figure in this plot but ultimately ended up in hiding after a secret agent divulged his participation to Georges Danton.

Despite the obstacle posed by one of the plot&#x27;s major architects going into hiding, the insurrection continued on, aided by the Kingdom of Great Britain, as the British desired continued access to the ports on Brittany&#x27;s coast. Brittany was especially open to British landings since the French Navy presence in the region was weakened by September 1793 due to previous mutinies and the restructuring of the navy. Brittany, with its weak infrastructure, was poorly connected to the rest of France. Normally, cities in Brittany were used for their naval importance, but they eventually became industrialized because of the Republic, which prepared them for war. The Committee of Public Safety was preparing to attack Britain as Britain had significant influence in the towns of Saint-Malo and Brest, and some revolutionaries feared that these towns would place themselves under British control as Toulon had done.

In light of these mounting foreign threats, the Committee of Public Safety sent Republican troops known as ‘Representatives on a Mission’ to local regions—such as Brittany—to ensure the preservation of national unity within France. The function of these Representatives, by order of the National Convention, was to replace the local government leaders. In doing so, the Representatives were meant to quell anti-revolutionary sentiment. The order of the National Convention on 14 August 1793 declared that these Representatives &quot;take every measure of interior and exterior defense which they may consider necessary&quot; contributed to the nation-wide violence experienced during the Terror. Jean-Baptiste Carrier, one prominent Representative on a Mission, who had been sent to Brittany, dutifully reported to the Committee of Public Safety that he would &quot;arrest those declared guilty of the counter-revolutionary disorders committed by this company&quot;. Pierre Louis Prieur, another such Representative on a Mission, was involved in extinguishing the uprisings in the coastal towns of Brittany such as Lorient and Vannes.
The peasants in Brittany were royalist and opposed the new government. Pierre Louis Prieur sought to implement the authority of the convention by arresting suspected counter-revolutionaries, removing the local authorities of Brittany, and making speeches. In Vannes, there was an unfavorable attitude towards the Revolution with only 200 of the city&#x27;s population of 12,000 accepting the new constitution. Prieur declared Brittany&#x27;s countryside overcome by fanaticism in order to justify terror as the new order. Prieur then infiltrated cities with troops and conducted house searches to locate and silence rebellious aristocrats and peasants. While arrests were the first defense of the newly established government against counter-revolutionaries, fear quickly mounted concerning the power of this group. Quickly, leaders such as Carrier had moved from ordering arrests to ordering executions of anyone found guilty of treason against the state.

===Post-Revolutionary period===

In the 19th-century Brittany acquired a reputation for timeless autarky, as Romantics developed an image of the province as a bastion of peasant traditionalism, religious festivals, and wild landscapes. At the same time, Breton life became increasingly integrated with that of the rest of France, particularly under the Third Republic.

However, the image of Brittany as anti-republican led French politicians to doubt the reliability of Breton soldiers during the military actions that followed the collapse of the Second French Empire, as resulted from the disastrous French defeat in the Battle of Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. Fearing Breton separatist sentiments, the soldiers were interned in a military camp, Camp Conlie, outside Le Mans. Because of bad conditions, worsened by mud and rain, several hundreds died from disease. The camp has been described as a &quot;concentration camp&quot; and became a significant atrocity story within Breton nationalism. In 1871 the camp was closed and the French military decided to incorporate the remaining 19,000 Breton soldiers into the 2nd Army of the Loire. They participated in the Battle of Le Mans, but poorly equipped, they were crushed by the Prussians and also blamed for the defeat by the French commanders.

Brittany has had its own regionalist and separatist movements which have experienced varying success at elections and other political contests. Modern Breton nationalism developed at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The main body of these movements situated themselves within the Catholic traditionalist current. After 1944, Breton nationalism was widely discredited thanks to the collaboration of a number of prominent nationalists (such as Roparz Hemon) with the Nazis, who occupied Brittany along with most of the rest of the French state during the Second World War. On the other hand, other Breton nationalists took part in the Resistance. Brittany played a particularly important role in the Resistance thanks to its proximity to Great Britain, the relatively rugged landscape, and the presence of important naval installations. However, during the Second World War the Allies bombed Brittany along with the rest of Northern France with such ferocity that many towns such as Lorient nearly ceased to exist. The act involved the killing of many thousands of French citizens. In the case of Lorient, the town was not freed until the end of the war and the submarine pens were not destroyed unlike the civilian areas which had been wiped out.

When France was divided into administrative regions by the Vichy government, the official Brittany Region included only four of the five departments traditionally understood to comprise the Breton territory. This removal of Loire-Atlantique, which contains Nantes (one of the two traditional Breton capitals) from the Breton region has been a matter of much controversy.

An experimental nuclear power station was constructed at Brennilis in the Monts d&#x27;Arrée during the 1960s. This was in operation for about ten years, and since 1988 it has been in the process of being dismantled. This is the first time that a nuclear power station has been dismantled in France.

Since the 1960s in particular Breton nationalism has developed a strong leftist character, alongside the Catholic traditionalist strain. Certain groups such as the FLB and the ARB, marginal even within nationalist circles, made headlines through sabotage against highly symbolic targets.

In March 1972, workers at the Joint Français, a factory in Saint-Brieuc, went on strike to obtain a wage increase. The strike lasted eight weeks.

Since the 1940s, use of the Breton language has declined precipitously. In most Breton-speaking communities, it has become uncommon for children born since 1945 to acquire much of the language as French becomes universalized. On the other hand, Breton has enjoyed increasing support among intellectuals and professionals since the 1970s, and the relatively small, urban-based Diwan movement has sought to stem the loss of young Breton speakers through bilingual immersion schools. Breton music has also become more widely known through the work of musicians such as Alan Stivell.

On 16 March 1978, the supertanker &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; ran aground a few hundred metres from the shores of the small port of Portsall in Ploudalmézeau. The result was the fifth-largest oil spill in world history which severely affected the north and northwest coasts of Brittany.

In February and March 1980, the population of Plogoff, the commune containing the Pointe du Raz, demonstrated to prevent the construction of a nuclear power generator in their commune, despite the paratroopers and helicopters sent by the government. They received a wide support from the media. The power station project was abandoned after the presidential elections of 1981, which brought François Mitterrand to power.

In 2014, the Bonnets Rouges destroyed hundreds of highway speed cameras, tax portals, and tax bureau offices in their successful direct action campaign to have the &quot;ecotaxe&quot; abolished.

<text>The Order of the Crown (, ) is a national order of the Kingdom of Belgium. The Order is one of Belgium&#x27;s highest honors.

== History ==
The Order was established on October 15, 1897, by King Leopold II in his capacity as ruler of the Congo Free State. The order was first intended to recognize heroic deeds and distinguished service achieved for service in the Congo Free State. In 1908, the Order of the Crown was made a national honour of Belgium, junior to the Order of Leopold.

Currently, the Order of the Crown is awarded for services rendered to the Belgian state, especially for meritorious service in public employment. The Order of the Crown is also awarded for distinguished artistic, literary or scientific achievements, or for commercial or industrial services in Belgium or Africa.

The Order may also be bestowed to foreign nationals and is frequently awarded to military and diplomatic personnel of other countries stationed in (or providing support to) Belgium. During the Second World War, the Order of the Crown was extensively authorized for award to Allied military personnel who had helped to liberate Belgium from the occupation forces of Nazi Germany.

The Order of the Crown is awarded by royal decree.

==Classes==
The Order of the Crown is awarded in five classes, plus two &quot;palms&quot; and three medals:
* &quot;Grand Cross&quot;, which wears the badge on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest;
* &quot;Grand Officer&quot;, which wears a star on the left chest, and may also wear the neck badge;
* &quot;Commander&quot;, which wears the badge on a neck ribbon;
* &quot;Officer&quot;, which wears the badge on a ribbon with rosette on the left chest;
* &quot;Knight&quot;, which wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest;
* &quot;Golden Palms&quot;, which wears a wreath of golden palms on a ribbon on the left chest;
* &quot;Silver Palms&quot;, which wears a wreath of silver palms on a ribbon on the left chest;
* &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, who wears the medal on the left chest;

The &quot;badge&quot; of the Order is a white-enamelled Maltese cross with straight rays, in silver for the Knight class and in gold for the higher classes. The obverse central disc has a gold crown on a blue enamelled background; the reverse central disc has the face-to-face monogram &quot;L&quot; (for King Leopold II) on a blue enamelled background. The badge is suspended from a green-enamelled wreath of laurel and oak leaves.

The &quot;plaque&quot; for Grand Cross is a faceted silver five-pointed star with golden rays between the branches of the star. The centre shows the obverse of a commander&#x27;s cross. The plaque for Grand Officer is a faceted five-armed &#x27;Maltese asterisk&#x27; (see Maltese cross), with golden rays between the arms. The centre shows the obverse of an officer&#x27;s cross.

The &quot;medal&quot; is round in gold, silver and bronze versions, with a suspension in the form of a royal crown with two pendelia and a ribbon ring. The obverse shows a finely ribbed central area with bead surround, with the royal crown superimposed. The surrounding circlet carries the motto of the Belgian Congo: &quot;Travail et Progrès&quot; (work and progress) —the later issues are bilingual including the Dutch &quot;Arbeid en Vooruitgang&quot; in the lower half of the circlet. The reverse is a stylised &#x27;double L&#x27; crowned Leopold II monogram within a palm wreath.

The &quot;ribbon&quot; of the order is usually plain maroon. However, if the order is awarded in special circumstances, the ribbon of the Officer and Knight classes show the following variations:

* Crossed swords are added to the ribbon when awarded in wartime (if the order was awarded during the Second World War or during the Korean War, a small bar is added to the ribbon mentioning the name of the war);
* The ribbon has a vertical gold border on both sides when awarded for a special act of valour;
* The ribbon has a central vertical gold stripe when awarded for an exceptionally meritorious act;
* A gold star is added to the ribbon when the recipient has been mentioned in despatches at the national level;
* Silver or gold palms are added to the ribbon when awarded in wartime to military personnel.
Stars, palms, borders or stripes can be awarded together, but these deviations are currently only rarely awarded.

The ribbon of the palms and medals has a vertical white border on both sides as well as a metal pin showing a reduction of the palm or medal.

The &quot;ribbon bar&quot; of the order, which is worn on the semi-formal dress uniform is:

Despite the fact that, in contrast to the Order of Leopold, no maritime division of the Order of the Crown exists, some unofficial decorations with crossed anchors under the wreath are known to exist.

==Award conditions==

===Current award conditions of Belgian national orders===
National orders are awarded by royal decree at fixed dates: 8 April (birthday of King Albert I), 15 November (King&#x27;s Feast), and in some cases on 21 July (Belgian national holiday) to reward meritorious services to the Kingdom of Belgium based on the career path and age of the recipient. A number of different regulations rule the award of national orders for the various ministries. In addition, the national orders may be awarded by the king for especially meritorious deeds. The royal decrees are published in the Belgian official journal, &quot;Moniteur Belge&quot;.

For people who are not Belgian, honours are not published in the Moniteur and bestowed all year round by the foreign office. Recent example is the Grand Cross of ambassador Vershbow.
The ministry responsible for foreign affairs, currently the Federal Public Service (SPF/FOD) Foreign Affairs, administers the national orders and the minister has the role of advisor in cases not fitting within a regulation.

For the award of national orders for persons to whom no regulation applies or has been adopted, the number of awards is limited every year by decision of the Council of Ministers (&quot;contingent&quot;).

The classes of the national orders are integrated in a &quot;combined hierarchy&quot; defined by law, whereby within one class the Order of Leopold is senior to the Order of the Crown, which is senior to the Order of Leopold II. One cannot be awarded a national order at a level below the highest that the recipient has already received.

Persons who are the subject of criminal proceedings will usually not be awarded a national order until they are declared not guilty.

===Award conditions to military personnel===
The Order of the Crown is mostly awarded to military personnel on the basis of their length of service, although exceptions to that rule exist where the order is presented to military personnel for exceptional or meritorious service. (e.g. the Chief of Defence is commonly presented with the Grand Cross after 1 or 2 years of service as CHOD).
When officers are considered for the award based on their length of service, their years of service in a non-officer&#x27;s rank count for half.
The first twelve years of service as a member of the flying personnel counts double.
* Grand Officer: Awarded after 38 years of meritorious service to a general officer with minimum rank of lieutenant-general;
* Commander: Awarded after 32 years of meritorious service to a field officer with minimum rank of colonel;
* Officer: Awarded after 25 years of meritorious service to a commissioned officer;
* Knight: Awarded after 15 years of meritorious service to a commissioned officer or after 35 years of meritorious service as a non-commissioned officer;
* Golden Palms: Awarded after 25 years of meritorious service to a non-commissioned officer, and after 35 years of service for a private or corporal;
* Silver Palms: Awarded after 30 years of meritorious service for a private or corporal.
For awards to military personnel, there is no minimum age requirement.

===Award conditions for long civilian service===
The palms and the medals of the Order of the Crown may be awarded to workers in the private sector or contractual employees of the public sector, as well as some public sector employees such as prison supervisors, ushers, burgomasters, police commissioners, local police officers, or members of town councils.

* Golden Palms: Awarded after 45 years of professional activity, or at the time of retirement after having worked for a minimum of 40 years;
* Gold Medal: Awarded after 35 years of professional activity.

In addition, the Gold Medal, the Silver Palms and the Golden Palms are awarded to the presidents, secretaries and members of the board of directors of representative trade organisations such as trade unions on the basis of the number of members of the organisation, of the length of their membership of the board, and on the length of their tenure on the board.

The Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the Crown is also awarded to the members of the national and provincial committees for the promotion of labour who have reached the age of 42 after a tenure of 10 years (national committee) or 20 years (provincial committee) and, after 30 years of service, to the secretaries of the provincial committees for the promotion of labour who have reached the age of 62.

The medal could also be awarded without the rigid &#x27;time in service&#x27; criteria to administrators, directors, department heads, artisans, architects, chemists, specialist craftsmen, etc., each case for an award assessed on an individual basis. 
The bronze medal appears to have been confined mainly to the European workers of the Belgian Congo or Congo Free State for 11 years service, apart from a period—duration unknown—when it was also used in Belgium to reward firemen and rural guards for 40 years&#x27; service.

==Equivalent orders==
Even though orders from different States are not always easy to compare, the Order of the Crown is roughly equivalent to the following orders from other States. 
* The British Order of the British Empire
* The French Ordre National du Mérite, which is the second highest French order and has similar classes and award conditions. 
* The Luxembourg Order of the Oak Crown, which is the third highest Luxembourgian order and has similar classes.
* The Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau, which is the third Dutch national order and has similar classes. 
* The Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, which is currently the second highest Norwegian order and has similar classes. 
* The Swedish Order of Vasa, which is the second highest Swedish order awarded more widely than to Heads of State and has similar classes. Prior to 1975, the Swedish Order of the Polar Star would be equivalent to the Order of the Crown instead.

<text>Richard Farmer FRS FSA (1735–1797) was a Shakespearean scholar and Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He is known for his &quot;Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare&quot; (1767), in which he maintained that Shakespeare&#x27;s knowledge of the classics was through translations, the errors of which he reproduced.

==Life==
Farmer was born at Leicester on 28 August 1735, the second son of Richard Farmer, a maltster, by his wife Hannah, daughter of John Knibb. He was educated under the Rev. Gerrard Andrewes, in the free grammar school at Leicester, and about 1753 entered as a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1757, and was a &#x27;senior optime.&#x27; He successfully contested with Wanley Sawbridge for the silver cup given at Emmanuel College to the best graduate of that year. In 1760 he commenced M.A., and succeeded the Rev. Mr. Bickham as classical tutor of his college. For many years, while tutor, he served the curacy of Swavesey.

On 19 May 1763 Farmer was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1765 he was junior proctor of the university. He had already formed an extensive library and had acquired a reputation as a scholar and antiquary. When Samuel Johnson visited Cambridge in 1765 he had a &#x27;joyous meeting&#x27; with Farmer at Emmanuel. The two scholars afterwards maintained a correspondence on literary topics; on one occasion Johnson requested Farmer to help George Steevens on translations which Shakespeare might have seen, and on another he himself asked for information from the university registers on Cambridge graduates in the &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;.

In 1767 he took the degree of B.D., and on 8 July 1769 Richard Terrick, bishop of London, appointed him one of the preachers at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. When in London he usually resided at the house of Dr. Anthony Askew, the eminent physician, in Queen Square, Bloomsbury. In 1775, on the death of Dr. Richardson, he was chosen master of Emmanuel College, Henry Hubbard, the senior fellow, having declined the post. He now took the degree of D.D., and was very soon succeeded in the tutorship by Dr. William Bennet, later bishop of Cloyne.

He served the office of vice-chancellor of the university in 1775–6, and again in 1787–8. During his first term of office the university voted an address to the king, in support of the American policy of the government. One member of the Caput refused to give up the key of the place containing the university seal, and Farmer is said to have forced open the door with a sledge-hammer—an exploit which some biographers allege to have been the cause of all his subsequent preferments. On the death of Dr. Barnardiston, master of Corpus Christi College, he was (27 June 1778) unanimously elected principal librarian of the university. In April 1780 he was by Bishop Richard Hurd to the prebend of Alrewas in Lichfield Cathedral. In March 1782 he was installed a canon in the ninth prebend of the church of Canterbury. After enjoying this prebend for several years he resigned it on being preferred by William Pitt to a canonry residentiary and the prebend of Consumpta-per-Mare at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on 19 March 1788.

The last years of his life were divided between Emmanuel College and the residentiary house in Amen Corner. He was a member of clubs: the Eumélean Club at Blenheim Tavern, Bond Street, of which Dr. John Ash was president, the Unincreasable Club, Queen&#x27;s Head, Holborn, of which Isaac Reed was president, and the Literary Club, founded by Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Farmer twice declined a bishopric that was offered to him by Pitt as a reward for his Tory principles. In 1796 he was admitted &quot;ad eundem&quot; at Oxford.

He died, after a long and painful illness, at the lodge of Emmanuel College, on 8 September 1797, and was buried in the chapel. A monument was erected to his memory in the cloisters, inscribed with a Latin epitaph composed by Samuel Parr. A portrait of him was engraved by John Jones from a painting by George Romney.

==Works==
His friend Isaac Reed remarked on his easy way at Emmanuel as a successful Master; but as a scholar he was not productive. When a young man he wrote some &quot;Directions for Studying the English History&quot;, which were printed in the &quot;European Magazine&quot; for 1791 and in William Seward&#x27;s &quot;Biographiana&quot;.

On 15 May 1766 Farmer issued from the university press proposals for printing the history of Leicester, written by Thomas Staveley; but eventually abandoned this plan. Staveley&#x27;s collections, together with those of the Rev. Samuel Carte, several original manuscripts, and some engraved plates, he presented to John Nichols, who made use of them in his work &quot;Leicestershire&quot;.

In 1767 he brought out the first edition of his only published work, an &quot;Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare&quot; (Cambridge), addressed to his friend and schoolfellow, Joseph Cradock of Gumley. A second expanded edition came out in the same year. A third edition was printed at London in 1789. A fourth edition appeared at London in 1821. The essay is also in George Steevens&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare 1793, in Reed&#x27;s edition 1803, in Harris&#x27;s edition 1812, and in Boswell&#x27;s &#x27;Variorum,’ 1821. Farmer proposed that Shakespeare&#x27;s knowledge of classical history was obtained at second hand through translations.

His library, rich in scarce tracts and old English literature, was sold in London in 1798. The catalogue extends to 379 pages, and the separate books number 8,155; it sold for £2,210. A scurrilous pamphlet, entitled &#x27;The Battle between Dr. Farmer and Peter Musgrave, the Cambridge Taylor, in Hudibrastic verse,’ appeared at London in 1792.

<text>Dean Frederic William Farrar (Bombay, 7 August 1831 – Canterbury, 22 March 1903) was a senior-ranking cleric of the Church of England, schoolteacher and author. He was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin in 1882. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles secret society. He was the Archdeacon of Westminster from 1883 to 1894, and Dean of Canterbury from 1895 until his death in 1903.

==Biography==
Farrar was born in Bombay, India, and educated at King William&#x27;s College on the Isle of Man, King&#x27;s College London and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for poetry in 1852. He was for some years a master at Harrow School and, from 1871 to 1876, the headmaster of Marlborough College.

Farrar spent much of his career associated with Westminster Abbey. He was successively a canon there (appointed in 1876), rector of St Margaret&#x27;s (the church next door), and eventually archdeacon of the Abbey (appointed in 1883). He later served as Dean of Canterbury; and chaplain in ordinary, i.e. attached to the Royal Household. He was an eloquent preacher and a voluminous author, his writings including stories of school life, such as &quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot; and &quot;St. Winifred&#x27;s&quot; about life in a boys&#x27; boarding school in late Victorian England, and two historical romances.

Farrar was a classics scholar and a comparative philologist, who applied Charles Darwin&#x27;s ideas of branching descent to the relationships between languages, engaging in a protracted debate with the anti-Darwinian linguist Max Müller. While Farrar was never convinced by the evidence for evolution in biology, he had no theological objections to the idea and urged that it be considered on purely scientific grounds. On Darwin&#x27;s nomination, Farrar was elected to the Royal Society in 1866 for his philological work. When Darwin died in 1882, the then Canon Farrar helped get the church&#x27;s permission for him to be buried in Westminster Abbey and preached the sermon at his funeral.

Farrar&#x27;s religious writings included &quot;Life of Christ&quot; (1874), which had great popularity, and &quot;Life of St. Paul&quot; (1879). He also contributed, first as Canon Farrar then as Archdeacon Farrar, two volumes to the commentary series &quot;The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges&quot;, on the Gospel according to St. Luke and on the Epistle to the Hebrews. His works were translated into many languages, especially &quot;Life of Christ&quot;.

Farrar believed that some could be saved after death. He originated the term &quot;abominable fancy&quot; for the longstanding Christian idea that the eternal punishment of the damned would entertain the saved. Farrar published &quot;Eternal Hope&quot; in 1878 and &quot;Mercy and Judgment&quot; in 1881, both of which defend his position on hell at length.

Farrar was accused of universalism, but he denies this belief with great certainty. In 1877 Farrar in an introduction to five sermons he wrote, in the preface he attacks the idea that he holds to universalism. He also dismisses any accusation from those who would say otherwise. He says, &quot;I dare not lay down any dogma of Universalism; partly because it is not clearly revealed to us, and partly because it is impossible for us to estimate the hardening effect of obstinate persistence in evil, and the power of the human will to resist the law and reject the love of God.&quot;

In April 1882, the then Canon Farrar was one of ten pallbearers at the funeral of Charles Darwin in Westminster Abbey; the others were: The Duke of Devonshire, The Duke of Argyll, The Earl of Derby, Mr. J. Russell Lowell, Mr. W. Spottiswoode, Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. A. R. Wallace, Thomas Huxley, and Sir John Lubbock (John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury)

==Family==

On 1 August 1860 at St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Exeter, he married Lucy Mary Cardew; they had five sons and five daughters:
* Reginald Anstruther Farrar (1861–)
* Evelyn Lucy Farrar (1862–)
* Hilda Cardew Farrar (1863–1908)
* Maud Farrar (1864–1949)
* Eric Maurice Farrar (1866–)
* Sibyl Farrar (1867–)
* Cyril Lytton Farrar (1869–)
* Lilian Farrar (1870–)
* Frederic Percival Farrar (1871–1946)
* Ivor Granville Farrar (1874–1944) (born Bernard Farrar)
The first eight were born at Harrow; the last two were born at Marlborough.

The second daughter, Hilda, was married in 1881 to John Stafford Northcote, vicar of St Andrew&#x27;s, Westminster. John was the third son of Sir Stafford Northcote, 1st Baronet (later created the 1st Earl of Iddesleigh); John and Hilda&#x27;s son Henry (1901–1970) succeeded as the 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh in 1927.

Farrar allowed his third daughter, Maud, to become engaged to Henry Montgomery at 14 and marry at 16, the marriage taking place in 1881. The then Canon Farrar was Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster at the time, and Montgomery was the curate. Montgomery went on to become Bishop of Tasmania. Henry and Maud&#x27;s children included Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, better known as &#x27;Monty&#x27;, a senior-ranking military commander in World War II.

Farrar&#x27;s son Reginald published his biography in 1902. Dean Farrar died on 22 March 1903 and was buried in the cloister of the Canterbury Cathedral.

Farrar has a street named after him – Dean Farrar Street in Westminster, London. There is also a memorial to him at the church of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster by the sculptor Nathaniel Hitch.

<doc id="1002184" wikidata="Q1455209" url="?curid=1002184" title="Fremont culture">
<text>The Fremont culture or Fremont people is a pre-Columbian archaeological culture which received its name from the Fremont River in the U.S. state of Utah, where the culture&#x27;s sites were discovered by local indigenous peoples like the Navajo and Ute. In Navajo culture, the pictographs are credited to people who lived before the flood. The Fremont River itself is named for John Charles Frémont, an American explorer. It inhabited sites in what is now Utah and parts of Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado from AD 1 to 1301 (2,000–700 years ago). It was adjacent to, roughly contemporaneous with, but distinctly different from the Ancestral Pueblo peoples located to their south.

==Location==

Fremont Indian State Park in the Clear Creek Canyon area in Sevier County Utah contains the biggest Fremont culture site in Utah. Thousand-year-old pit houses, petroglyphs, and other Fremont artifacts were discovered at Range Creek, Utah. Nearby Nine Mile Canyon has long been known for its large collection of Fremont rock art. Other sites are found in The San Rafael Swell, Capitol Reef National Park, Dinosaur National Monument, Zion National Park, and Arches National Park.

==Name==
The name &quot;Fremont&quot; was first applied to an archaeological assemblage of tools, art, architecture, and pottery by Noel Morss in his 1931 book, &quot;The Ancient Culture of the Fremont River in Utah&quot;.

In 1776, Fray Escalante of the Domínguez–Escalante expedition referred to them as &quot;Tihuas&quot; or &quot;Tehuas&quot;, by means of ethnographic analogy to contemporary Tiwa Puebloans, writing that the Colorado Plateau was &quot;The land by way of which the Tihuas, Tehuas and the other Indians transmigrated to this kingdom; which is clearly shown by the ruins of the pueblos I have seen in it, whose form was the same that they afterwards gave to theirs in New Mexico; and the fragments of clay and pottery which I also saw in the said country are much like that which the said Tehuas make today.&quot;

John Steward, writing in his journal on August 4, 1871 during the Colorado River Exploring Expedition, reported having found two graves and speculated that, &quot;They may be those of the Moquis tribes which evidently inhabited this section of the country at some time and were driven out many years ago. Their ruins are everywhere to be found where the country is rendered inhabitable by garden spots along the river.&quot; 
&quot;Moqui&quot; is a Hopi autonym borrowed into other adjacent languages.
The Ute referred to the former inhabitants of the many village ruins in their territory as the &quot;mocutz&quot;.

Modern scholarship has suggested that it may be more appropriate to refer to this assemblage as the &quot;Fremont complex&quot; rather than as a coherent cultural group, as the use of the generic label &quot;The Fremont&quot; implies the existence of a bounded, discrete entity which, &quot;fails miserably in defining a people who [...] are not easily described or classified.&quot;

==People==
Scholars do not agree that the Fremont culture represents a single, cohesive group with a common language, ancestry, or way of life, but several aspects of their material culture provides evidence for this concept. First, Fremont culture people foraged wild food sources and grew corn. The culture participated in a continuum of fairly reliable subsistence strategies that no doubt varied by place and time. This shows up in the archaeological record at most village sites and long-term camps as a collection of butchered, cooked and then discarded bone from mostly deer and rabbits, charred corn cobs with the kernels removed, and wild edible plant remains. Other unifying characteristics include the manufacture of relatively expedient gray ware pottery and a signature style of basketry and rock art. Most of the Fremont lived in small single and extended family units comprising villages ranging from two to a dozen pithouse structures, with only a few having been occupied at any one time. Still, exceptions to this rule exist (partly why the Fremont have earned a reputation for being so hard to define), including an unusually large village in the Parowan Valley of southwestern Utah, the large and extensively excavated village of Five Finger Ridge at the above mentioned Fremont Indian State Park, and others, all appearing to be anomalous in that they were either occupied for a long period of time, were simultaneously occupied by a large number of people, 60 or more at any given moment, or both. The Fremont are sometimes thought to have begun as a splinter group of the Ancestral Pueblo people, although archaeologists do not agree on this theory.

According to archaeologist Dean Snow,
Fremont people generally wore moccasins like their Great Basin ancestors rather than sandals like the Ancestral Puebloans. They were part-time farmers who lived in scattered semi-sedentary farmsteads and small villages, never entirely giving up traditional hunting and gathering for more risky full-time farming. They made pottery, built houses and food storage facilities, and raised corn, but overall they must have looked like poor cousins to the major traditions of the Greater Southwest, while at the same time seeming like aspiring copy-cats to the hunter-gatherers still living around them.

Snow notes that Fremont culture declined due to changing climate conditions c. 950 CE. The culture moved to the then-marshy areas of northwestern Utah, which sustained them for about 400 years.

==Recent developments==

The Range Creek Canyon site complex is unambiguously identified with the Fremont culture, and because of its astonishingly pristine state, brought an immense amount of archaeological insight to this hitherto obscure culture.

First explored in 2004, the Range Creek property was a major find:
Pit houses dug halfway in the ground, their roofs caved in, dotted the valley floor and surrounding hills. Arrowheads, beads, ceramic shards and stone-tool remnants were strewn all over. Human bones poked out of rock overhangs, and hundreds of bizarre human figures with tapered limbs and odd projections emanating from their heads were chiseled on the cliff walls ... the pit houses were intact ... and granaries were stuffed with corncobs a thousand years old.

Research completed in 2006 indicated that the land included 1,000-year-old hamlets of the Fremont people &quot;highly mobile hunters and farmers who lived mostly in Utah from around A.D. 200 to 1300 before disappearing...&quot;

According to Snow, the Fremont&#x27;s eventual fate is unknown, but it is possible that they moved into Idaho, Nebraska and Kansas, and may have become part of the Dismal River culture to the east or the Ancestral Pueblo communities to the south or absorbed by the arriving Numic-speaking peoples.

<text>Henry Fawcett (26 August 1833 – 6 November 1884) was a British academic, statesman and economist.

==Background and education==

Henry Fawcett was born in Salisbury where his father was a gentleman farmer. He was educated at the Agricultural College, Queenwood, at King&#x27;s College School and the University of Cambridge: entering Peterhouse in 1852, he migrated to Trinity Hall the following year, and became a fellow there in 1856, the year he graduated BA as 7th Wrangler.

In September 1858, when he was 25, he was blinded in a shooting accident. Despite his blindness, he continued with his studies, especially in economics. He was able to enter Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but decided against a career as a barrister and took his name off their books in 1860. He became a student of John Stuart Mill and wrote a Manual of Political Economy in 1863.

==Academic career==
Two years later, Henry Fawcett reportedly attended the 1860 Oxford evolution debate, during which he was asked whether he thought Bishop Samuel Wilberforce had actually read the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. Reportedly, Henry Fawcett replied loudly, &quot;Oh no, I would swear he has never read a word of it&quot;. Ready to recriminate, Wilberforce swung round to him scowling, but stepped back and bit his tongue on noting that the speaker was the blind economist.

At the next meeting (in September 1861) of the British Association in Manchester, Henry Fawcett defended the logic behind Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories. This significantly affected its acceptance.

In 1863, Henry Fawcett published his &quot;Manual of Political Economy&quot; and became Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge. He made himself a recognised authority on economics, his works on which include &quot;The Economic Position of the British Labourer&quot; (1865) and &quot;Labour and Wages&quot;.

In 1883, he was elected Rector of Glasgow University.

==Political career==
After repeated defeats as a Liberal Party candidate, Henry Fawcett was elected Member of Parliament for Brighton in 1865. He held this seat until 1874, and thereafter represented Hackney between 1874 and 1884. He campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1880, he was appointed Postmaster General by William Ewart Gladstone and sworn of the Privy Council.

He had a particular interest in encouraging saving through the Post Office Savings Bank. He introduced the savings stamp which allowed people to save pennies at a time to build up the minimum account limit of a shilling. He pushed through parliament an act to allow savers to convert their post office savings to government stock and he developed the post office&#x27;s life insurance and annuities schemes. He introduced many other innovations, including parcel post, postal orders, and licensing changes to permit payphones and trunk lines.

==Family==
Through his campaigning for women&#x27;s suffrage, Henry Fawcett met Elizabeth Garrett, to whom he proposed in 1865. She rejected the proposal to concentrate on becoming a doctor at a time when female doctors were extremely rare.

In 1867, Fawcett married Elizabeth&#x27;s younger sister Millicent Garrett. They had one child, Philippa Fawcett.

Henry Fawcett&#x27;s career was cut short by his premature death from pleurisy in November 1884, aged 51. He is buried in Trumpington Extension Cemetery, Cambridge where several members of the family of Charles Darwin are also buried, including Sir George Darwin, Lady Maud Darwin, and Gwen Raverat.

==Legacy==
There are statues of him in Salisbury Market Square and in Victoria Embankment Gardens (&quot;Henry Fawcett Memorial&quot;) near Charing Cross in central London. The latter is by the eminent sculptor Mary Grant. A fine statue with an angel standing over a seated Henry Fawcett (by the sculptor George Tinworth) was erected in 1893 in Vauxhall Park (opened in 1890 on this site of Fawcett&#x27;s house, The Lawns) but was removed by Lambeth Council in 1959. Alfred Gilbert was commissioned to make a memorial which stands in Westminster Abbey.

Sir Leslie Stephen wrote a biography of him, &quot;Life of Henry Fawcett&quot;, in 1885. He is listed amongst the important British Reformers on the &quot;Reformers Memorial&quot; in the centre of the eastmost oval section in Kensal Green Cemetery.

Fawcett Primary School in Trumpington, Cambridge, was opened in 1949 and named after Henry Fawcett who lived nearby. There is also a Henry Fawcett primary school in London, which opened in 1937.

Fawcett&#x27;s time as Postmaster General was fondly remembered by many postal workers, and when London sorting clerks formed a union in 1890, they named it the Fawcett Association.

<text>Houston, Houston, Do You Read? is a novella by James Tiptree Jr. (pseudonym of Alice Sheldon). It won a Nebula Award for Best Novella and a Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1977.

The novella first appeared in the anthology &quot;&quot;, edited by Vonda N. McIntyre and Susan J. Anderson, published by Fawcett in May 1976. It was subsequently reprinted several times (amongst others in the James Tiptree collections &quot;Star Songs of an Old Primate&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Her Smoke Rose Up Forever&quot; in 1990) and in 1989 was published in a Tor Doubles mass market paperback (number eleven in that series) with the flipside novella &quot;Souls&quot; by Joanna Russ.

==Plot summary==
The story is narrated in the third person from the point of view of Dr. Orren Lorimer, the science officer of the spaceship &quot;Sunbird&quot;, which is sent on a circumsolar mission at some time in the last two decades of the twentieth century. It is a three-man mission, the other two men being the commander, Major Norman Davis (&quot;Dave&quot;) and Captain Bernhard Geirr (&quot;Bud&quot;); they have shared tight quarters, boring prepackaged food, and barely adequate life support systems for over a year. Having sustained considerable damage from a solar flare, they have passed around the Sun and look forward to returning to their families on Earth.

When they try to contact Mission Control in Houston, the only radio sources they can find are women, who gradually convince them that the solar flare has sent the &quot;Sunbird&quot; about three hundred years into the future. The women are from Earth, they have a lunar base and spaceships, and they rescue the &quot;Sunbird&quot;&#x27;s crew. Their ship, the &quot;Gloria&quot;, turns out to be very large; the four women, with the help of &quot;Andy&quot;, maintain an ecosystem and enjoy fresh food, comfortable sleep, and exercise. The &quot;Sunbird&quot; men (especially Dave, the mission leader) are dismayed to learn that they have no ranks or hierarchy, either on the ships or on Earth. Lorimer learns that the one man, Andy, is actually a woman on male hormones. In fact, no Y chromosomes at all have survived into the present time on Earth, due to an epidemic. The women reproduce by cloning 11,000 survivors of a disaster that wiped out all the rest of humanity. Each of the 11,000 women has produced a lineage of cloned sisters/daughters who develop great self-knowledge through these relationships.

The crew of the &quot;Gloria&quot; test the three men using a truth drug. Bud, the second in command, tries to rape one of the women, all the while insulting her, and hits Andy when the latter tries to interfere. Lorimer watches Bud&#x27;s activities, always admiring the masculinity of violent men. Dave, when he learns the truth, pulls a gun and crucifix and starts giving everyone orders; Lorimer helps the women disarm him, accepting the women&#x27;s decision that men pose too great a threat to their society, and must be killed. Although Lorimer is &quot;more human&quot; (as one woman says) than the other two, he, like Bud and Dave, finds a life without a patriarchal hierarchy unthinkable.

==Adaptations and influences==
&quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot; was adapted as a radio drama for the National Public Radio series &quot;Sci-Fi Radio&quot;. It originally aired as two half-hour shows, February 4 &amp; 11, 1990.

&quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot; is referenced in the dialogue of the first issue of the post-apocalyptic comic &quot;&quot;, which also depicts a plague that kills off all men, three astronauts who survived the plague in orbit, and a new female society that survives by cloning.

In this work Murphy looks at the way utopian/dystopian literature blends humanity, society, nature, and technology. Murphy notes how Triptree, as well, combined these notions and took an almost &quot;insect&quot;-like approach to humanity, in which the mother is the primary care-taker of young and the males serve little to no purpose beyond providing DNA for reproduction.

In this article, Pearson notes how women authors perceive utopias. They, like Triptree, envision a world where male violence and sexual inequalities are not existent. In Triptree&#x27;s case, she created a world in which men do not exist at all.

<text>Francis Fawkes (1720–1777) was an English poet and translator. He translated works by Anacreon, Sappho and other classical authors, modernised parts of the poems of Gavin Douglas, and was the author of the well-known song, &quot;The Brown Jug&quot;, and of two poems, &quot;Bramham Park&quot; and &quot;Partridge Shooting&quot;. His translation of the &quot;Argonautica&quot; in rhymed couplets appeared in 1780.

==Life==
Fawkes was born near Doncaster, the son of Jeremiah Fawkes, for twenty-eight years rector of Warmsworth, Doncaster. 
He was baptised at Warmsworth on 4 April 1720. He was educated at Bury Grammar School under the Rev. John Lister. On 16 March 1738 he was admitted as a sizar to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his tutor was the Rev. Richard Oakley. He took his degree of B.A in 1742, and proceeded to an M.A. in 1745.

He was ordained in the Church of England, and took the curacy of Bramham in Yorkshire. He later held the curacy of Croydon, where he came to the notice of Archbishop Thomas Herring, leading to his becoming the vicar of Orpington, Kent. He remained at Orpington until April 1774, when, by the favour of Charles Plumptree, rector of Orpington and patron of the adjacent rectory of Hayes, he was appointed to Hayes with the curacy of Downe. The other piece of clerical patronage which he received was a chaplaincy to the Princess Dowager of Wales.

He died on 26 August 1777, leaving his widow, formerly a Miss Purrier of Leeds, whom he married about 1760, with scanty resources. His library was sold in 1778.

==Works==
Fawkes was a sort of chaplain to George Fox-Lane, and his first production in literature is said to have been an anonymous poem of 1745 describing the beauties of his house, Bramham Park. An elegy for Herring, &#x27;Aurelius&#x27;, was printed in 1761 in Fawkes&#x27;s &quot;Original Poems and Translations&quot;; it was reprinted in 1763 in the collection &quot;Seven Sermons by Archbishop Herring&quot;.

Fawkes was considered by his contemporaries to be the best translator since the days of Alexander Pope, and his translation of the works of Anacreon was admired by Samuel Johnson.

His works were:

* &quot;A Description of May from Gawin Douglas&quot; (modernised), by F. Fawkes, 1752; with a poetic dedication to William Dixon of Loversal, a Yorkshire friend. (Second edition
* &quot;A Description of Winter from Gawin Douglas&quot;, 1754, modernised in style and dedicated to &quot;the Rev. John Lister, A.M., formerly my preceptor.&quot; The &quot;Description of May&quot; was included among the reprints of the Aungervyle Society. 
* &quot;Works of Anacreon, Sappho, Bion, Moschus, and Musæus translated into English by a gentleman of Cambridge&quot;, 1760. Many of the odes were translated by him during his college days, and in some instances he reprinted the versions of William Broome and other writers; 2nd edit. with his name, 1789. Fawkes&#x27;s translation was printed in France in 1835 and included in the &#x27;Collections of the British Poets&#x27; by Robert Anderson (vol. xiii.) and Alexander Chalmers (vol. xx.), and in the &#x27;Greek and Roman Poets&#x27; of Charles Whittingham (vol. xiv.). His version of Bion, Moschus, Sappho, and Musæus was published with translations of Hesiod by Charles Abraham Elton, and of Lycophron by Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston in 1832. 
* &quot;Original Poems and Translations&quot;, 1761. Many of the original pieces were humorous; the translations were chiefly from &#x27;Menander&#x27; and from the Latin poems of Christopher Smart. 
* &quot;The Complete Family Bible, with Notes Theological, Moral, Critical&quot;, 1761. To this production, which came out in sixty weekly numbers, he sold his name for money, and there was an edition in 1765 &quot;with notes taken from Fawkes.&quot; 
* &quot;The Poetical Calendar&quot;, intended as a supplement to Robert Dodsley&#x27;s collection; selected by Fawkes and William Woty, 1763, 12 vols. To the twelfth volume of this collection Samuel Johnson contributed a character of William Collins, which later formed the basis of the life of Collins in the &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;.
* &quot;Poetical Magazine, or the Muses&#x27; Monthly Companion&quot;, vol. i. 1764. It lasted for six months, January to June 1764. In this undertaking Fawkes was again associated with Woty. 
* &quot;Partridge-Shooting&quot;, an eclogue to the Hon. Charles Yorke, 1764. This piece was suggested by Yorke. 
* &quot;The Works of Horace in English Verse, by Mr. Duncombe and other hands&quot;, to which are added many imitations, 1767, 4 vols. Some of the translations and imitations are by Fawkes. 
* &quot;The Idylliums of Theocritus, translated by Francis Fawkes&quot;, 1767. In this translation he had the assistance of friends, including Zachary Pearce, John Jortin, and Samuel Johnson. It was dedicated to Charles Yorke. 
* Apollonius Rhodius translated into English, published after his death in 1780, revised by Henry Meen for Fawkes&#x27;s widow.

Fawkes&#x27;s volume of original poems was embodied in the collection by Chalmers (vol. xvi.), some of them were included in John Nichols&#x27;s collection, viii. 88–93, and several of his translations, chiefly from &quot;Menander&quot;, were reprinted in part i. of the &quot;Comicorum Græcorum Fragmenta&quot; selected by James Bailey (1840).

Lord Mahon, later Earl of Stanhope, married Lady Hester Pitt, daughter of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, whose seat was situated in Fawkes&#x27;s parish of Hayes, on 19 December 1774, and some lines addressed to the bridegroom by Fawkes on this occasion are printed in the &quot;Chatham Correspondence&quot;, iv. 373. Great popularity attended his song of &quot;The Brown Jug&quot;, which began with the words
:Dear Tom, this brown jug that now foams with mild ale
:Was once Toby Fillpott.

It was introduced by John O&#x27;Keeffe into his comic opera &quot;The Poor Soldier&quot;, which was played at Covent Garden Theatre for the first time on 4 November 1783. It was sung then by John Henry Johnstone, and it was later a favourite piece of Charles Incledon. During the debates on Catholic emancipation the opening lines were quoted in the House of Commons by George Canning to ridicule John Copley: the punning imputation was that a speech by Copley was from a pamphlet of Henry Phillpotts.

<text>Cruzeiro (Portuguese meaning the Southern Cross, the Brazilian national symbol) is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is located about from the state capital. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 82,571 (2020 est.) in an area of 305,70 km2. People of things who come from or inhabit in Cruzeiro are called &quot;cruzeirense&quot;.

==Population history==

==Coat of arms==

Its coat of arms features a shield with blue on the top and white at the bottom with its part of a flag in the top left and the Southern Cross which has its golden stars on the right.

==Flag==

Its flag colors are red on the top left with four golden stars with a white circle and its state (São Paulo) where the city is located in the middle and with 13 stripes, seven of them are blue and six of them are white. It has a red tag reading in Portuguese &quot;Cultura Civismo&quot; meaning Civic Culture on the left, &quot;Paz&quot; meaning Peace in the middle and &quot;Liberdade e Trabalho&quot; meaning Freedom and Work on the bottom and a golden crown on the top.

==Geography==

The municipality is situated at an elevation of in the valley of the river Paraíba do Sul. To the north is the mountain range Serra da Mantiqueira, which reaches elevations up to and forms the border with the state of Minas Gerais. Cruzeiro lies about halfway between the two largest agglomerations of Brazil: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Within a radius of around Cruzeiro, the population is around 40 million people.

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

===Transportation===

The main highways around Cruzeiro are the President Dutra Highway (BR-116, São Paulo - Rio de Janeiro) and the state highways of SP-52 (towards São Lourenço, Minas Gerais) and SP-58. Cruzeiro has a station on the main railway line from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, but this was closed for passenger traffic in 1998.

==History==

Cruzeiro was founded at the junction of the railway lines of three states (São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro). The railway, as well as coffee production were important in the 19th century, when Brazil was still an agrarian monarchy.

The first owner of what would be Cruzeiro&#x27;s lands was Major Novaes, a resident of Fazenda Dona Tita, now a museum.

At the Mantiqueira railway tunnel, north of the city, an important battle between the Federalists and the Constitutionalists took place in 1932.

Nowadays, the municipality contains an economic focus on commerce, tourism, as well as metallurgical industry: e.g., former FNV (Fábrica Nacional de Vagões), now run by Maxion Rodas e Chassis, a division of an international company that produces rail components, makes up for a large part of the fragile economy.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Economy ==
Today, the city&#x27;s economic focus is on commerce (it has important companies such as Casas Bahia, Pernambucanas, O Lojão Magazine, Lojas Cem, Magazine Luiza, Lojas Americanas) and the metallurgical industry. The former FNV (National Wagon Factory) currently has its industrial park divided between two companies of the Iochpe-Maxion group: Amsted-Maxion Fundição e Equipamentos Ferroviários, which was the merger of the Iochpe-Maxion group with the North American Amsted Industries, and Maxion Sistemas Automotivos-Divisão de Rodas e Chassis. Amsted-Maxion is a reference in foundry, with units in the United States and Hortolândia. Maxion Sistemas Automotivos has branches in Curitiba and the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, as well as a branch in China, and is a multinational industry of railway components and production of wheels and chassis, with more than 6 thousand employees. The company sells its products to more than 40 countries on five different continents, with the United States, Italy, Argentina, Canada and Venezuela being the largest importers. In addition, the company currently produces chassis for vans, trucks and cars for major national automakers such as Fiat, Volkswagen, Nissan, Scania, among others. The two companies together account for more than half of the city&#x27;s economy.

<text>Owen Feltham (1602 – 23 February 1668) was an English writer, author of a book entitled &quot;Resolves, Divine, Moral, and Political&quot; (c. 1620), containing 146 short essays. It had great popularity in its day. Feltham was for a time in the household of the Earl of Thomond as chaplain or secretary, and published &quot;Brief Character of the Low Countries&quot; (1652). His most cited essay is &quot;How the Distempers of These Times Should Affect Wise Men&quot;, which John Gross included in &quot;The Oxford Book of Essays&quot;.

==&quot;Resolves, Divine, Moral and Political&quot;==
Feltham was 21 years old when the first edition of &quot;Resolves&quot; was published in 1623. This collection of essays played a crucial role in the development of the English essay as a genre.

The original edition includes 100 “resolves”, “short, aphoristic commentaries on aspects of the three realms delineated by the title: divine, ethical, and political,&quot; which &quot;concern in equal measure the private and public realms of middle-class English life”. Later revisions reflect how Feltham attempted to amalgamate these three distinct dimensions of “middle-class English life”, divine, ethical and political, into a cohesive whole. The revisions reflect “a more tolerant humanism”, perhaps best demonstrated in his handling of the &quot;Woman Question&quot;, about which Feltham &quot;asks commonsense questions and is willing to look beyond stereotypes”. In the 1628 edition, which includes the resolve “Of Woman”, Feltham asks: “Whence proceed the most abhorred villainies, but from a masculine unblushing impudence? When a woman grows bold and daring, we dislike her, and say, ‘she is too like a man’: yet in our selves, we magnify what we condemn. Is not this injustice?” In the 1661 edition the 85th resolve, &quot;Of Marriage and Single Life&quot;, Feltham writes: &quot;A wise wife comprehends both sexes: she is a woman for her body, and she is a man within: for her soul is like her Husbands. ... It is a Crown of blessings, when in one woman a man findeth both a wife and a friend.&quot;

<doc id="1002197" wikidata="Q6860749" url="?curid=1002197" title="Milsom and Fowler">
<text>Albert Milsome and Henry Fowler murdered Henry Smith, a 79-year–old, wealthy, retired engineer, on 14 February 1896, at his house in Muswell Hill, London.

The story of the murder of Mr. Smith has entered English criminal history as one of the classic &quot;cut-throat&quot; cases involving a pair of killers. A &quot;cut-throat&quot; case is one where the killers each put forth a defence that the other one was guilty, and in doing this they only convince the jury that both parties are equally guilty of the killing. Another example of such a case is that of Frederick Guy Browne and William Kennedy for the murder of Police Constable George Gutteridge in 1928.

Muswell Hill was a wealthy neighbourhood in North London. In 1896 the elderly Smith lived there in a large house called Muswell Lodge. Smith was somewhat reclusive, and rumour had it he was a wealthy miser keeping large sums of money in the house. He lived alone (though he had a gardener in the daytime), and apparently pegged his safety on some trap-guns set up on the grounds; unfortunately, he did not have any secondary level of protection. 

Smith&#x27;s body was discovered on the morning of 14 February, a few hours after his murder, by his gardener, Charles Webber, who alerted Smith&#x27;s neighbours, called in a local doctor (Ridley Webster, M.D.), and notified the police. They entered the house and found that Smith had been bound with shreds of blankets and had sustained several head wounds. Two pocket knives and a toy lantern were found next to the body. Smith&#x27;s safe had been cracked and his bedroom torn apart. The day before the murder two men had been seen near the house. For weeks the police tried to find the killers, using the toy lantern as the best clue they had. Unfortunately hundreds were in existence, so it was a clue that might never be traced. Instead, a Detective named William Burrell was aware of a burglar named Albert Milsome who had disappeared from his neighbourhood. Milsome had recently been seen in the company of one Henry Fowler. Burrell was aware of the younger brother-in-law of Milsome reportedly having a toy lantern, but understood he could not question him or other members of the family about it without tipping them off about its significance. A trap was set at a nearby candy store, where the lantern was set up. The trap succeeded when Milsome&#x27;s brother-in-law, Henry Miller, identified the lantern as his own. 

Now that they were aware that it was Milsome whom they wanted, and that Fowler was missing as well, the police started a manhunt. It eventually turned out that the men were together in a small travelling waxworks that journeyed to fairs around the country, with Fowler acting as the strong man in the circus. A police raid captured both men at Bath. Milsom gave up meekly, but Fowler fought like a tiger and had to be clubbed into submission. 

Fowler denied knowing anything about the murder, but Milsome soon cracked under the strain and confessed to robbing Smith, though he said his partner had done the killing. Their trial was held in the Old Bailey in front of Mr. Justice Sir Henry Hawkins. The evidence was basically streamlined because of Milsom&#x27;s confession, although Fowler kept denying its truth. Fowler was aware of the great damage Milson had done. During a break in the trial, Fowler suddenly jumped up in the dock, and started throttling him. A number of policemen interfered and pulled Fowler off the cowering Milsom. 

As it turned out the jury believed Milsome in part - the evidence had shown two knives near the dead Smith, and that suggested the two burglars had jointly committed the tying up and killing of the man. Milsom collapsed when he heard the guilty verdict against him. Fowler just laughed at the failure of Milsom&#x27;s scheme, and mimicked his partner&#x27;s protesting of the verdict. When asked if they had anything further to say, Fowler told the court that there were two miscarriages of justice for which he was responsible, naming two recent convictions of two burglars for whose crimes Fowler claimed responsibility. He asked the court to keep these in mind for reviewing those two sentences. As it turned out, Fowler was lying - the evidence against the two burglars was stronger than Fowler thought, and they (the two burglars) were friends of his for whom he was trying to do a favour.

The authorities were afraid that when Milsome and Fowler were going to be hanged Fowler might attack Milsome again. It was decided to hang the two men with a third one between them. A recent double murder had been committed in the Whitechapel section of London of a pawnbroker named John Goodman Levy and his housekeeper, Mrs. Sarah Gale by a burglar named William Seaman. Seaman was cornered while still in Levy&#x27;s home on the roof. He was subdued in a violent fight by future Chief Constable of Scotland Yard, Frederick Porter Wensley. Seaman too was sentenced to death, and he was put between Milsome and Fowler on the gallows built at Newgate Prison on 9 June 1896. Actually, despite fears by the executioner John Billington Fowler did not make a scene. He came out onto the scaffold after Milsome and Seaman were set up, asked if Milsome was there, and was satisfied to see he was. Seaman, until then unaware of why he was being placed as he was between the Muswell Hill murderers, said, &quot;Well this is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever been a bloody peacemaker.&quot; Shortly afterwards all three men were hanged.

Usually this is the end of the anecdote about the triple execution of 9 June 1896. There is a little more involved in it. At one point there was a chance that there would have been a quadruple hanging because Amelia Dyer the notorious baby farmer, was supposed to be hanged with them,
but it was decided that Mrs. Dyer should be hanged the following day. She was taken out of the prison and taken for a police wagon ride until after the three men were executed. Also at least one source adds to the anecdote about Seaman&#x27;s final words on the scaffold. Edward Abinger
the barrister best recalled for his defence of Steinie Morrison in 1910, wrote an autobiography. In it he reveals that a moment after Seaman made his comment, Fowler signaled he wanted to say something. It is possible that Seaman&#x27;s comment struck Fowler as funny, and he said (according to Abinger), &quot;Well this is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever been a bloody penitent.&quot; But Abinger is the only person who ever seems to have noted that comment.

<text>Dusheti () is a town in Georgia, the administrative center of Dusheti Municipality, in the Mtskheta-Mtianeti region, 54 km northeast of the nation&#x27;s capital of Tbilisi.

==History==
Dusheti is on both banks of the small, mountainous Dushetis-Khevi River in the foothills of the Greater Caucasus range at an elevation of 900 m. It functions as the center of the Dusheti Municipality which, beyond the town itself, includes several villages of the historical community of Pkhovi, (Pshavi, and Khevsureti). As of the 2014 all-Georgia census, the town had a population of about 6,167.

Dusheti first appears in Georgian written records in 1215. In the 17th century, it served as a residence of the local mountainous lords – the dukes of Aragvi – whose defiance to the Georgian crown more than once led to invasions and devastation of the town by the royal troops. After the abolition of the duchy of Aragvi in the 1740s, Dusheti passed to the crown but significantly declined. In 1801, the Russians took over and granted Dusheti a town status. Next year, it became the center of Dusheti uezd. The town and its environs were a scene of disturbances during the Russian Revolution of 1905, the peasants’ revolt in 1918, and an armed clash during the 1924 August Uprising against the Soviet rule. Dusheti was a center of agriculture and light industry during the Soviet era, but suffered an economic decline and population decrease in the years following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Nowadays, most people work in service industries (banking, education, auto-repair, and retail) as well as subsistence farming. The town is also known for its &quot;khinkali&quot;, a meat-filled dumpling very popular in Georgia.

==Transport==
Dusheti has access by a paved road to the highway connecting Tbilisi and Stepantsminda. There is a regular bus traffic between Dusheti and Tbilisi.

==Culture and recreation==
There are several historical and recreational places in and around Dusheti such as the Ananuri castle and the Bazaleti Lake. The town itself houses a number of architectural monuments including the 9th-10th-century church of St. George and the 18th-century palace of the Chilashvili family.

<text>Elijah Fenton (20 May 1683 – 16 July 1730) was an English poet, biographer and translator.

==Life==
Born in Shelton (now Stoke-on-Trent), and educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, for a time he acted as secretary to the Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery in Flanders, and was then Master of Sevenoaks Grammar School.

In 1707, Fenton published a book of poems. He later became tutor to Sir William Trumbull&#x27;s son at Easthampstead Park in Berkshire and is now best known as the assistant of his neighbour, Alexander Pope, in his translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, of which he &#x27;Englished&#x27; the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth books, catching the manner of his master so completely that it is hardly possible to distinguish between their work; while thus engaged he published (1723) a successful tragedy, &quot;Mariamne&quot;. His later contributions to literature were a &quot;Life&quot; of John Milton, and as an editor of Edmund Waller&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (1729).

He died on 16 July 1730, and is buried in the churchyard of Stoke Parish Church, Stoke-on-Trent.

There is a memorial to him on the wall of St Michael and St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church, Easthampstead, with an epitaph by Alexander Pope. This reads:-
&lt;poem&gt;
To the memory of Elijah Fenton of Shelton in Staffordshire,
who dyed at Easthampstead Anno 1730, aged forty seven years.
In honour of his great integrity &amp; Learning.
William Trumbell Esq erected this monument.

This modest stone what few vain marbles can
May truly say, here lies an honest man
A poet blest beyond the poets fate
Whom heav&#x27;n left sacred from the proud and great
Foe to loud praise and friend to learned ease
Content with science in the vale of peace
Calmly he look&#x27;d on either life &amp; here
Saw nothing to regret, or there to fear
From natur&#x27;s temp&#x27;rate feast rose satisfy&#x27;d
Thank&#x27;d heav&#x27;n that he had liv&#x27;d and that he dy&#x27;d.

&quot;A. POPE&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>&quot;Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death&quot; is a short story by James Tiptree, Jr., a pen name used by American writer Alice Sheldon. It won a Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1974. It first appeared in the anthology &quot;The Alien Condition&quot;, edited by Stephen Goldin, published by Ballantine Books in April 1973.

==Plot==

The story is told in the first person by Moggadeet, a self-aware male of a species which appears to be the apex predator of its environment. This possibly anthropoid species is apparently cold-blooded, with various features that come into play in battle, nurturing the young (for females), and sex. Unusually Moggadeet&#x27;s mother and an older male have supplemented his instincts by making him aware of the Plan, i.e., the normal life-cycle of his species. The element of this Plan he most resists is the cannibalism of other members of his own species. 

Moggadeet narrates his life from the moment he meets his mate in the spring of his second year, including his memories of his first year. After a while he remembers what his mate said at various points, expressing fears and concerns. By the end it becomes clear that Moggadeet is telling this story to his mate while she is eating him; he assumes she agrees with his recollections.

<text>Nathan Field (also spelled Feild occasionally; 17 October 1587 – 1620) was an English dramatist and actor.

==Life==
His father was the Puritan preacher John Field, and his brother Theophilus Field became the Bishop of Llandaff. One of his brothers, named Nathaniel, often confused with the actor, became a printer.

Nathan&#x27;s father opposed London&#x27;s public entertainments: he delivered a sermon that attributed Divine judgment to the collapse of the public seating area, during a bear baiting on a Sunday, at Beargarden in 1583, which resulted in several deaths. Nathan presumably did not intend a career in the theatre; he was a student of Richard Mulcaster at St. Paul&#x27;s School in the late 1590s. At some point before 1600, he was impressed by Nathaniel Giles, the master of Elizabeth&#x27;s choir and one of the managers of the new troupe of boy players at Blackfriars Theatre, called alternately the Children of the Chapel Royal and the Blackfriars Children. He remained in this profession for the remainder of his life, later adding to it the profession of a playwright. John Field was buried on 26 March 1588.

When John Field died, he left seven children, of whom the eldest was only seventeen. He left all his property to his wife, Joan. The first child was a daughter, Dorcas, baptized on 7 May 1570. The first son was baptized on 4 January 1572 and was named after his father, John. Theophilus was baptized on 22 January 1574, Jonathan on 13 May 1577, Nathaniel on 13 June 1581, Elizabeth on 2 February 1583 and Nathan on 17 October 1587. Little is known of the two daughters: Dorcas was married to Edward Rice on 9 November 1590; Elizabeth was buried at St. Anne, Blackfriars, on 14 June 1603, when she had just reached twenty, the age at which Dorcas married. We know nothing of the life of John Field, junior. Jonathan Field, who died in 1640. Theophilus followed his father&#x27;s profession. He married and in his will left all his possessions to his wife, Alice. He died on 2 June 1636 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral.

As a member of the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels, Field acted in the innovative drama staged at Blackfriars in the first years of the 17th century. Cast lists associate him with Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Cynthia&#x27;s Revels&quot; (1600) and &quot;The Poetaster&quot; (1601); a 1641 quarto associated him with George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot;.
Later in the decade, he performed in &quot;Epicoene&quot; and, perhaps, played Humphrey in Francis Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;. During the same years, he wrote commendatory verses for Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; and , and for John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Faithful Shepherdess&quot;.
Field was presumably also among those of the children&#x27;s company briefly imprisoned for the official displeasure occasioned by &quot;Eastward Hoe&quot; and John Day&#x27;s &quot;The Isle of Gulls&quot;; the latter imprisonment was in Bridewell Prison.

Field stayed with a children&#x27;s company until 1613, his twenty-sixth year. He appears to be the only one of the boy actors of 1600 to remain with the Blackfriars troupe when, in 1609, Philip Rosseter and Robert Keysar assumed control of the company. In this company, he performed in the theatre in Whitefriars and, frequently, at court, in plays such as Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Coxcomb&quot;. From the latter years of this period come the first of his plays: &quot;A Woman is a Weathercock&quot; and &quot;The Honest Man&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (the latter with Fletcher and Philip Massinger).

In 1613, Rosseter combined his company with the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men, managed by Philip Henslowe. Performing at the Swan Theatre and Hope Theatre, Field acted in Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot; and Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;. For the latter play, in which he may have performed as Cokes or Littlewit, he received payment for the company after a performance at court. These years witnessed some degree of tumult; Henslowe&#x27;s business practices resulted in his actors&#x27; drawing up certain &quot;articles of grievance&quot; against him, and Rosseter&#x27;s attempt to build a new private theater (Porter&#x27;s Hall) in Blackfriars was blocked by the city and Privy Council. This period ended when Henslowe died, Rosseter abandoned his plans, and Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men briefly merged and then separated from Prince Charles&#x27;s Men, thereafter touring in the country. For Field, the period had a presumably more satisfactory end: by late 1616, he had joined the King&#x27;s Men.

With the King&#x27;s Men, Field seems to have performed as Voltore in &quot;Volpone&quot; and as Face in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;. It is not clear what other parts he played; an epigram, produced by John Payne Collier, that associated the actor with the role of Othello is an apparent forgery. Edmond Malone supposed that Field played women&#x27;s roles with the company; O. J. Campbell, however, suggests that he played young second leads. Of course he acted in a number of Fletcher&#x27;s plays, as well as Shakespeare&#x27;s; presumably he also acted in his own &quot;Amends for Ladies&quot; (printed 1618, though probably written earlier), and in &quot;The Fatal Dowry&quot;, which he wrote with Philip Massinger. Field died some time between May 1619 and August 1620.

Scholars and critics have argued for authorial contributions from Field in a number of plays of his era, most commonly in &quot;Four Plays in One,&quot; &quot;The Honest Man&#x27;s Fortune,&quot; &quot;The Queen of Corinth&quot; and &quot;The Knight of Malta,&quot; four dramas in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators.

Field had a contemporary reputation as a ladies&#x27; man; gossip reported by William Trumbull charges him with a child of the Countess of Argyll. A portrait believed to be of Field can be seen at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, UK, in which he is depicted as a melancholy figure with hand on heart. It has been said that this painting may be one of the first depictions of an actor &quot;in character&quot;. The portrait artist is unknown, but some believe that it was painted by William Larkin.

==Cultural references==
Susan Cooper&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;King of Shadows&quot; features Nathan Field as a character. Set in 1599, it uses Field&#x27;s background as a student of Richard Mulcaster&#x27;s at St Paul&#x27;s as a springboard. The Nathan Field in the story, who briefly works at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre, is actually a like-named boy from 1999, who has switched places with the young Elizabethan actor.

<text>Cubatão is a city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, 12 kilometers away from Santos seaport, the largest in Latin America. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of the Baixada Santista. The population is 131,626 (2020 est.) in an area of 142.88 km2. It hosts industries, refining oil, steel mills and fertilizers.

==History==
The municipality was created by state law in 1948.

In the early 1980s, Cubatão was one of the most polluted cities in the world, nicknamed &quot;Valley of Death&quot;, due to births of brainless children and respiratory, hepatic and blood illnesses. High air pollution was killing forest over hills around the city. It was ranked the top ten dirtiest cities in the world by &quot;Popular Science&quot;.

Around 0:00 BRT (3:00 GMT) on Saturday, 25 February 1984, an oil spill set the shantytown Vila Socó on fire, killing 93 people according to official figures of the government, though the actual death toll may be more than 200.
The contamination of workers with persistent organic pollutants put the now defunct Rhodia into Greenpeace&#x27;s top 10 world&#x27;s worst corporate crimes ever in its report to Rio Summit in 1992.

Strong efforts were made to diminish pollution in the city, costing US$ 1.2 billion so far. Although things have improved a lot, it is impossible to completely clean the soil and groundwater and while many large industries continue to work in such a small area, there will always be some pollution.

==Popular culture==
Cubatão was mentioned as the &quot;world&#x27;s most polluted town&quot; in the Jello Biafra-Sepultura collaboration &quot;Biotech is Godzilla&quot; on the group&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;

Cubatão is the name of an A La Carte song from 1981.

==Divisions==
===Piaçaguera===
Piaçaguera is a location within the city of Cubatão in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The Rodovia Cônego Domênico Rangoni highway, formerly known as the Piaçaguera-Guarujá highway, starts there. It connects the Via Anchieta to Guarujá, crossing the Bertioga canal. It is there that the climb through the Serra do Mar escarpment begins by way of the Santos-Jundiaí railway line.

&quot;Piaçaguera&quot; is a term from the Tupi language that means &quot;old port&quot; by way of the conjunction of the two words &quot;peasaba&quot; (&quot;port&quot;) and &quot;ûera&quot; (&quot;velho&quot;).

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by the Companhia Telefônica da Borda do Campo until 1975, when it began to be served by the Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1002215" wikidata="Q13685" url="?curid=1002215" title="Siddi">
<text>The Siddi (), also known as the Sheedi, Sidi, or Siddhi, are an ethnic minority group inhabiting Pakistan and India. They are primarily descended from the Bantu peoples of the Zanj coast in Southeast Africa, most of whom came to the Indian subcontinent through the Indian Ocean slave trade. Others arrived as merchants, sailors, indentured servants, and mercenaries.

== Etymology ==
There are conflicting hypotheses on the origin of the name &quot;Siddi&quot;. One theory is that the word derives from &quot;sahibi&quot;, an Arabic term of respect in North Africa, similar to the word &quot;sahib&quot; in modern India and Pakistan. A second theory is that the term &quot;Siddi&quot; is derived from the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to India; these captains were known as &quot;Sayyid&quot;. A different name occasionally used for the Siddi is the term &quot;Habshi&quot;. While originally used to refer specifically to the Habesha peoples, Ethio-Semitic-speakers from Abyssinia, the term later became more broadly used to refer to Africans of any ethnicity, but not necessarily referring to the Siddi specifically.

Siddis are also sometimes referred to as Afro-Indians. Siddis were referred to as &quot;Zanji&quot; by Arabs; in China, various transcriptions of this Arabic word were used, including &quot;Xinji&quot; (辛吉) and &quot;Jinzhi&quot; (津芝).

== History ==
The Siddi population derived primarily from Bantu peoples of Southeast Africa who were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves. Most of these migrants were or else became Muslims, while a small minority became Hindu. The Nizam of Hyderabad also employed African-origin guards and soldiers.

The first Siddis are thought to have arrived in India in 628 CE at the Bharuch port. Several others followed with the first Arab Islamic conquest of the subcontinent in 712 CE. The latter group are believed to have been soldiers with Muhammad bin Qasim&#x27;s Arab army, and were called &quot;Zanjis&quot;.

Some Siddis escaped slavery to establish communities in forested areas. Siddis were also brought as slaves by the Deccan Sultanates. These Siddis embraced Deccani Muslim culture, and identified with the Deccani Indian Muslim political faction against the Iranian Shia immigrants. Several former slaves rose to high ranks in the military and administration, the most prominent of which was Malik Ambar.

==Geographical distribution==
=== India ===

Harris (1971) provides a historical survey of the eastward dispersal of slaves from Southeast Africa to places like India. Hamilton (1990) argues that Siddis in India, their histories, experiences, cultures, and expressions, are integral to the African Diaspora and thus, help better understand the dynamics of dispersed peoples. More recent focused scholarship argues that although Siddis are numerically a minority, their historic presence in India for over five hundred years, as well as their self-perception, and how the broader Indian society relates to them, make them a distinct Bantu/Indian. Historically, Siddis have not existed only within binary relations to the nation state and imperial forces. They did not simply succumb to the ideologies and structures of imperial forces, nor did they simply rebel against imperial rule. The Siddi are recognized as a scheduled tribe in 3 states and 1 union territory: Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Daman and Diu.

====Hyderabad====
In the 18th century, a Siddi community arrived with the Arab, and frequently served as cavalry guards to the Asif Jahi Nizam of Hyderabad&#x27;s army. The Asif Jahi rulers patronised them with rewards and the traditional Marfa music gained popularity and would be performed during official celebrations and ceremonies.

==== Gujarat ====
Supposedly presented as slaves by the Portuguese to the local Prince, Nawab of Junagadh, the Siddis also live around Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife sanctuary. On the way to Deva-dungar is the village of Sirvan, inhabited entirely by Siddis. They were brought 300 years ago from Portuguese colonial territories for the Nawab of Junagadh. Today, they follow very few of their original customs, with a few exceptions like the traditional Dhamal dance.

Although Gujarati Siddis have adopted the language and many customs of their surrounding populations, some of their Bantu traditions have been preserved. These include the &quot;Goma&quot; music and dance form, which is sometimes called &quot;Dhamaal&quot; (Gujarati: ધમાલ, fun). The term is believed to be derived from the Ngoma drumming and traditional dance forms of the Bantu people inhabiting Central, East and Southern Africa. The Goma also has a spiritual significance and, at the climax of the dance, some dancers are believed to be vehicles for the presence of Siddi saints of the past.

&quot;Goma&quot; music comes from the Kiswahili word &quot;ngoma&quot;, which means a drum or drums. It also denotes any dancing occasion where traditional drums are principally used.

The majority of the Siddis in Gujarat are Muslims (98.7%), with very few following Hinduism (1%).

==== Karnataka ====
The Siddis of Karnataka (also spelled &quot;Siddhis&quot;) are an ethnic minority group of mainly Bantu descent that has made Karnataka their home for the last 400 years. There is a 50,000-strong Siddhi population across India, of which more than a third live in Karnataka. In Karnataka, they are concentrated around Yellapur, Haliyal, Ankola, Joida, Mundgod and Sirsi taluks of Uttara Kannada and in Khanapur of Belgaum and Kalaghatagi of Dharwad district. Many members of the Siddis community of Karnataka had migrated to Pakistan after independence and have settled in Karachi, Sindh.

A plurality of the Siddis in Karnataka follow Hinduism (41.8%), followed by Islam (30.6%) and Christianity (27.4%).

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, locals of Bantu descent are called &quot;Sheedi&quot; and &quot;Makrani&quot;. They live primarily along the Makran in Balochistan, and Southern Sindh. Even though most Sheedis today in Pakistan are of mixed heritage and the number population is complex to determine, the population in 2018 was estimated to be of around 250,000. Many Sheedis have largely assimilated into the larger Baloch identity, and linguistically, they speak variations of Balochi, Sindhi (in Karachi), and have created a distinct dialect of Urdu named &quot;Makrani&quot;, with Urdu words mixed with Balochi and Sindhi expressions and common English terms, mainly picked up from English films and TV series.

Although Sheedi remains a neutral term, many individuals are moving away from it, instead adopting the surname Qambrani, in reverence to Qambar, the freed slave of Ali, while others prefer the name Bilali, referencing Bilal, a companion of Prophet Muhammad.

==== Sindh ====

African presence in Sindh is documented from 711 A.D. after the Umayyad conquest of Sindh. However, significant African slave importation to Sindh occurred from the late 18th to mid-19th centuries, during the peak of the Omani-Arab slave trade. Slaves mostly from modern-day Kenya and Tanzania, were captured and sold in Zanzibar, then shipped to Muscat until reaching Karachi. The demand for African slaves increased in Sindh as the Talpur rulers granted land to Baloch warlords, who sought slaves.

A few slaves, due to their intelligence and loyalty, rose to prominence. Hoshu Sheedi is known to have fought during the British invasion, particularly at the Battle of Hyderabad in 1843, where he died fighting. He is remembered as a hero and symbol of Sindhi resistance, with his battle cry: &quot;My head you may take, but my Sindh I will not forsake.&quot; After the British defeated the Talpurs, slavery and the slave trade were ironically banned in Sindh, leading to the emancipation of the Sheedi community.

Sheedis are largely populated in different towns and villages in southern Sindh. In the city of Karachi, the main Sheedi centre is the area of Lyari and other nearby coastal areas. The Mombasa street in Lyari is named after the city of Mombasa in Kenya. The children of interracial marriage of a Sindhi man and a Sheedi woman are called Gadra/Gada/Guda. 

Most Sheedis in Karachi are historically associated with the fishing business, traditionally working as fishermen, sailors and small boat operators. They also constitute the largest labour force employed at the Port of Karachi and harbour. Many increasingly have pursued higher professions. Muhammad Siddique Musafir was a popular writer and poet of the Sindhi language. During the British Raj, notable Sheedi descent leaders emerged through local self-government initiatives, including the mayor of Karachi Allah Bakhsh Gabol. His son Abdul Sattar Gabol became one of the founding members of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party. Tanzeela Qambrani became the first Sheedi woman to be elected as the member of Provincial Assembly of Sindh in 2018 Pakistani general election.

==== Balochistan ====
The arrival of Africans on the Makran coast of Balochistan is tied to the same slave trade that brought Sindhi Sheedis from East Africa. However, their journey was likely more intricate due to the historical recruitment of Baloch mercenaries by the rulers of Oman, along with African slaves as soldiers and laborers on date farms. This created a historical link between the two groups. In 1782, the ruler of the Khanate of Kalat, who controlled Makran, ceded Gwadar and surrounding territories to Oman, facilitating further interaction between the two groups. As the 18th century progressed, the Sultan of Oman expanded his influence along the Iranian coast acquiring various ports, which allowed African slaves engaged in maritime activities to reach Gwadar and other regions that are now part of Pakistan. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, famines and slave rebellions in coastal Iran led to the liberation and migration of many slaves and free individuals towards the East, with a significant number settling in eastern Makran. Many ultimately moved to Lyari in Karachi.

In the interior of the Makran district and surrounding Balochistan areas, where Sheedis were historically used as slave laborers on date farms, many still find themselves in bonded labor situations today. Despite the formal abolition of slavery by the ruler of Kalat in 1914, the practice of keeping domestic slaves persisted until the late 1950s. Today, some landlords and religious leaders continue to employ black servants.

==Genetics==
Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Siddi. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Siddi.

===Y DNA===
A Y-chromosome study by Shah et al. (2011) tested Siddi individuals in India for paternal lineages. The authors observed the E1b1a1-M2 haplogroup, which is frequent among Bantu peoples, in about 42% and 34% of Siddis from Karnataka and Gujarat, respectively. Around 14% of Siddis from Karnataka and 35% of Siddis from Gujarat also belonged to the Sub-Saharan B-M60. The remaining Siddis had Indian associated or Near Eastern-linked clades, including haplogroups P, H, R1a-M17, J2 and L-M20.

Thangaraj (2009) observed similar, mainly Bantu-linked paternal affinities amongst the Siddi.

Qamar et al. (2002) analysed Makrani Sheedis in Pakistan and found that they instead predominantly carried Indian-associated or Near Eastern-linked haplogroups. R1a1a-M17 (30.30%), J2 (18.18%) and R2 (18.18%) were their most common male lineages. Only around 12% carried Africa-derived clades, which mainly consisted of the archaic haplogroup B-M60, of which they bore the highest frequency of any Pakistani population Underhill et al. (2009) likewise detected a relatively high frequency of R1a1a-M17 (25%) subclade among Makrani Sheedis.

===mtDNA===
According to an mtDNA study by Shah et al. (2011), the maternal ancestry of the Siddi consists of mostly Bantu-associated haplogroups with barely any Indian-associated haplogroups, reflecting insignificant female gene flow from neighbouring Indian populations. About 95% of the Siddis from Gujarat and 99% of the Siddis from Karnataka belonged to various Bantu-derived macro-haplogroup L subclades. The latter mainly consisted of L0 and L2a sublineages associated with Bantu women. The remainder possessed Indian-specific subclades of the Eurasian haplogroups M and N, which points to recent admixture with autochthonous Indian groups.

===Autosomal DNA===
Narang et al. (2011) examined the autosomal DNA of Siddis in India. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis&#x27; ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples. The remainder is associated with locals North and Northwest Indian populations, due to recent admixture events.

Similarly, Shah et al. (2011) observed that Siddis in Gujarat derive 66.90%–70.50% of their ancestry from Bantu forebears, while the Siddis in Karnataka possess 64.80%–74.40% such Southeast African ancestry. The remaining autosomal DNA components in the studied Siddi were mainly associated with local South Asian populations. According to the authors, gene flow between the Siddis&#x27; Bantu ancestors and local Indian populations was also largely unidirectional. They estimate this admixture episode&#x27;s time of occurrence at within the past 200 years or eight generations.

== Culture ==
While they have assimilated in many ways to the dominant culture, they have also kept some ancestral practices especially in music and dance. Like other ethnic groups separated by geography, there are both differences and similarities in cultural practices among the Siddi.

=== Clothing ===
When it comes to dress, women and men dress in typical South Asian attires. Siddi women wear the garments predominant in their locale, which can be colorful saris accessorised with bindis in India or salwar kameez in Pakistan. Men wear what is generally appropriate for men in their communities.

=== Festivals ===
The annual Sheedi Mela festival in Pakistan is the key event in the Sheedi community&#x27;s cultural calendar. Some glimpses of the rituals at the festival include visit to sacred alligators at Mangopir, playing music and dance. Clearly, the instrument, songs and dance appear to be derived from Africa.

They are also active in cultural activities and annual festivals, like the Habash Festival, with the support of several community organisations. In Sindh, Sheedi men perform a unique dance on &quot;mugarman&quot; an ancestral traditional musical instrument of Sheedis, dressed in their traditional attire with markings on face, they also perform dangerous stunts while performing like spitting fire out of mouth, the dance is generally called as Sheedi dance.

=== Music ===
In the nascent Baloch culture awareness in the 20th century, many individuals involved in this cultural and political revitalization were of African descent. Among them was Bilawal Belgium from Lyari, who gained national and international acclaim for his mastery of the banjo for Sindhi and Balochi music on Radio Pakistan and as a member of Pakistan’s official music groups travelling to different countries. 

=== Assimilation ===
Generally, the Siddi primarily associate and marry members of their own communities. It is rare for the Siddi to marry outside of their communities although in Pakistan a growing number of the Sheedi intermarry as a way to dilute their African lineage and reduce racial discrimination and prejudice.

Siddi communities, although classified as a tribe by the Indian government, primarily live in agricultural communities where men are responsible for the farming and women are responsible for the home and children. Outside of their communities, men also tend to be employed as farm hands, drivers, manual laborers, and security guards.

As in other aspects of life, the Siddi have adopted the common dietary practices of the dominant society. An example of a staple meal would be a large portions of rice with dal and pickles.

=== Sports ===
Athletics has been an important part of the Siddi community and has been a means to uplift youth and a means of escape from poverty and discrimination. Football and boxing are the most popular sports, and some of the most notable boxers and footballers in Pakistan have mostly emerged from Lyari, which is one of the ethnic heartlands of the community.

The Sheedi community has played a large role in Pakistani football history. In its early years, football in Pakistan was mainly concentrated to Balochistan and the locality of Lyari, from where majority of players of the Pakistan national football team were recruited mainly in the 1960s, which is often regarded as the early golden age of Pakistani football. Notable players during this period include Abdul Ghafoor, nicknamed the &quot;Pakistani Pelé&quot; and &quot;Black Pearl of Pakistan&quot;, Muhammad Umer, Moosa Ghazi, Abid Ghazi, Turab Ali, Abdullah Rahi, Murad Bakhsh, Qadir Bakhsh, Maula Bakhsh, among others.

== Religion ==
Siddis are primarily Muslims, although some are Hindus and others belong to the Catholic Church. Majority of Sheedis in Pakistan belong to the Sunni Barelvi school of faith. The Sufi saint Pir Mangho is regarded by many as an important Wali, and the annual Sheedi Mela festival is the key event in the Sheedi community&#x27;s cultural calendar.

<text>George Finlay (21 December 1799 – 26 January 1875) was a Scottish historian.

==Biography==
Finlay was born in Faversham, Kent, where his Scottish father, Captain John Finlay FRS, an officer in the Royal Engineers, was inspector of government powder mills. Finlay&#x27;s father died in 1802, and his Scottish mother and uncle (Kirkman Finlay) took hand of his education. His love of history was attributed to his mother.

Intended for the law, he was educated at the University of Glasgow, the University of Göttingen, and the University of Edinburgh, but becoming an enthusiast in the cause of Greece, in 1823 he joined Byron in the war of independence. Thereafter he bought a property near Athens, where he settled and busied himself with schemes for the improvement of the country, which met with little success. Although he formed an unfavourable opinion of the Greek leaders, both civil and military, he did not lose his enthusiasm for their cause.

A severe attack of fever, combined with other circumstances, induced him to spend the winter of 1824–1825 and the spring of 1825 in Rome, Naples and Sicily. He then returned to Scotland, and, after spending a summer at Castle Toward, Argyllshire, went to Edinburgh, where he passed his examination in civil law at the university, with a view to being called to the Scottish bar.

However, his enthusiasm for Greece took him back there for good. He took part in the unsuccessful operations of Lord Cochrane and Sir Richard Church for the attempted relief of Athens in 1827. When independence had been secured in 1829 he bought a landed estate in Attica, but all his efforts for the introduction of a better system of agriculture ended in failure, and he devoted himself to the literary work which occupied the rest of his life, and for many years, he acted as the special correspondent of the London &quot;Times&quot;.

Finlay was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838, and in 1854 he received from the university of Edinburgh the honorary degree of LL.D. He died in Athens.

His &quot;History of Greece&quot;, produced in sections between 1843 and 1861, did not at first receive the recognition which its merits deserved, but it has since been given by scholars in all countries, and specially in Germany, a place among works of permanent value, alike for its literary style and the depth and insight of its historical views. It was re-issued in 1877 as &quot;A History of Greece from the Roman Conquest to the Present Time&quot; (146 BC to 1864).

Confusion arising from a work of Thomas Moore on the life of Byron which refers to his uncle by full name but Finlay only by surname, lead to some of his exploits being ascribed to a putative brother Kirkman Finlay.

<text>The China Relief Expedition was an expedition in China undertaken by the United States Armed Forces to rescue United States citizens, European nationals, and other foreign nationals during the latter years of the Boxer Rebellion, which lasted from 1898 to 1901. The China Relief Expedition was part of a multi-national military effort known as the Eight-Nation Alliance to which the United States contributed troops between 1900 and 1901. Towards the close of the expedition, the focus shifted from rescuing non-combatants to suppressing the rebellion. By 1902, at least in the city of Beijing (Peking), the Boxer Rebellion had been effectively controlled.

==Background==
The American annexation of the Philippines resulting from the Spanish–American War stimulated a growing American interest in China for both commercial and humanitarian reasons. The Philippines served as a convenient way point for trade with the Qing China, and would be of use in the protection of American interests in the Pacific. The dominant problem in China at the end of the nineteenth century was its threatened partition by the Great Powers. Both the United States and the British opposed this, and in September 1899 the United States announced it had secured agreement from the interested powers for maintenance of an Open Door policy in their relations with China.

Many Chinese resented the extensive foreign intervention in China. This discontent coalesced into the nucleus of a secret group called the Righteous Harmony Society (義和團 – Yìhétuán); Westerners called them Boxers. The Boxers, with the support of Prince Duan, undertook a campaign against foreign influences and foreigners. By early 1900 this movement had brought much of China to the verge of revolution. Boxers in the northern provinces attacked and killed hundreds of Chinese Christians and foreigners, mostly missionaries. The wave of unrest came to an apex following the assassination of Clemens von Ketteler, the German ambassador plenipotentiary, on June 20. The Chinese government then broke off diplomatic relations and demanded that all foreigners leave immediately, promising safe escort. About 3,500 foreigners and Chinese Christians refused to leave, and fearing for their safety, took refuge in the foreign legation compound, where they were besieged. A composite military force of 407 men (including 56 Americans) plus about 200 civilians defended the compound.

The Great Powers took immediate steps to organize a large relief expedition for Beijing, to stamp out what came to be known as the Boxer Rebellion. Although the William McKinley administration disliked the idea of becoming involved in an international incident with overtones of entangling foreign alliances during an election year, President McKinley agreed to join with the other powers to take steps to rescue their beleaguered nationals.

===Seymour Expedition===
The Seymour Expedition (10–26 June), an international column of Sailors and Marines, including 112 Americans, made a hurried attempt to relieve Beijing, but failed to get through when it met with severe resistance after it left Tianjin, the nearest port city to Beijing.

===Skirmishes around Tianjin===
As a result of the Philippine–American War, the United States had forces available nearby in the Philippines, and was therefore in a position to contribute one of the larger contingents to the international relief expedition. The first American forces left the Philippines on June 14. A detachment of 107 Marines went to China to protect American lives and property; this detachment was drawn from the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment stationed at Cavite. This detachment steamed toward Taku aboard the USS &quot;Newark&quot;, arriving on June 18, where they joined by 32 Marines aboard the . Under the command of Major Littleton W.T. Waller, the detachment landed at Taku the next day and advanced toward Tianjin.

Although General Arthur MacArthur Jr., commanding in the Philippines, was reluctant to weaken his already overextended forces, he agreed to dispatch to China the 9th Infantry Regiment, which departed from Manila on June 27 aboard USAT &quot;Logan&quot;. On June 17 the United States Navy&#x27;s China Squadron under Rear Admiral Louis Kempff declined to join foreign naval forces in the Battle of Taku Forts, which guarded the river approach to Tianjin. On July 6 the 9th Infantry Regiment arrived at Taku. Colonel Emerson H. Liscum, commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, disembarked the regiment&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Battalions and marched on Tianjin. On 13 July 1900 elements of this force participated in the attack on Tianjin troops from several other nations. The city of Tianjin fell to the Allies on the same day. Liscum and the flag bearer of the regiment were killed by Chinese snipers, the 9th infantry regiment suffered a ten percent casualty rate.

By the beginning of August, the American forces were reinforced by the 14th Infantry Regiment, and Battery F of the 5th Artillery Regiment. Major General Adna R. Chaffee Sr arrived in Nagasaki, Japan, on July 24. Within two days of his arrival, General Chaffee received orders to proceed to Taku and assume command of the American forces there; his new command was designated the China Relief Expedition.

Other units, including the 6th Cavalry Regiment, were deployed directly from the mainland United States. Using Manila as a base and Nagasaki as an advance port, the United States eventually assembled some 2,500 soldiers and Marines in China.

==Battle of Peking==

By early August a multinational coalition of 19,000 soldiers, including British, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Austrian, Italian, and American troops, was ready to move out of Tianjin toward Beijing, some seventy miles distant. High points of the fighting en route were at Beicang, which fell on 5 August, and a severe engagement for American and British contingents at Yangcun on 6 August. The force reached the Qing capital on 12 August 1900 and prepared immediately to assault the gates leading into the Outer City. Lacking effective central direction, the relief expedition&#x27;s attack was poorly executed. The Russian contingent prematurely forced an entrance into the Outer City on 10 August, only to be ambushed by waiting Chinese soldiers and require rescue by other allied troops. In the seizure of the Outer City of Beijing on 14 August, elements of the 14th Infantry scaled the Tartar Wall, planted the first foreign flag ever to fly there, and opened the way for British units to relieve the legation compound. Then on 15 August, Captain Henry J. Reilly&#x27;s Light Battery F of the U.S. 5th Artillery shattered the gates leading into the Inner City with several well-placed salvos, opening the way for the allied troops to occupy the center of Beijing. Although American troops had suffered comparatively light losses—slightly more than 200 killed and wounded—they did not take part in subsequent military operations, which consisted primarily of suppressing scattered Boxer elements and rescuing foreigners in the provinces. Most American units were withdrawn to Manila before winter, and mopping up operations in the provinces were left to the other Powers. A few American Regulars remained to form part of an allied occupation force and a small guard for the United States Legation in Beijing.

==Aftermath==

In a few months the Allies offered peace terms to the Dowager Empress, which included the payment of an indemnity and reaffirm previously existing commercial concessions. During prolonged negotiations an international army of occupation to which the United States contributed a small contingent of Regulars remained in north China. It was withdrawn in September 1901 under terms of the Boxer Protocol. This agreement also provided that the powers maintain a fortified legation in Beijing, garrison the Tianjin-Beijing Railway—an American contingent served as a part of this force until 1938—and receive reparations of $333 million. Of this amount the United States claimed only $25 million. In a few years it became apparent that even this sum was more than was needed to indemnify claims of American nationals and in 1907, and again in 1924, the United States returned portions totaling nearly $17 million to China, which placed the money in a trust fund for education of Chinese youths in both countries.

The participation of the United States in the Boxer Uprising marked the first time since the American Revolution that the country had joined with other powers in an allied military operation. The intervention in China represented an instance of the gradual change taking place in the traditional policies and attitudes of the United States in world affairs as a result of the triumph of imperialism. Most Americans still believed, despite the acquisition of overseas colonies, the nation could continue to adhere to its doctrine of isolationism. Developments in the early years of the 20th century would demonstrate, however, that the nation had to make changes and adjustments in many long-established institutions and policies—including those relating to military defense of the country—to meet the requirements of its new status as a world power.

==United States military medals==
For serving during the China Relief Expedition, the United States military created the China Campaign Medal and the China Relief Expedition Medal.
== US regiments involved ==
==Streamer==
The China Relief Expedition streamer is yellow with a narrow blue stripe on each side. The color yellow was restricted for use only by the Manchu rulers of China during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The color blue is emblematic of the East and of the blue dragon depicted on the yellow imperial and the Eight Banner standards.

<text>RAF West Drayton was a non-flying Royal Air Force station in West Drayton, within the London Borough of Hillingdon, which served as the main centre for military air traffic control in the United Kingdom. It was co-located with the civilian London Air Traffic Control Centre to provide a vital link between civil and military flying and airspace requirements. Following the departure of the remaining civil and military air traffic control systems by 2008, the site was closed and demolished for a new residential development.

==History==
=== RNAS/RAF Construction Depot===
* In January 1918 three hundred Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) personnel were stationed at Stockley in the Yiewsley Urban District.

* The RNAS West Drayton depot was established as the main base for the RNAS Air Construction Corps (ACC), having a Repair Shop, two Stores, Packing and Receiving Rooms, Officers&#x27; Mess and Quarters, Executive Office, Sergeants&#x27; Mess and Quarters for the men. 

* The Corps was renamed the Air Service Constructional Corps and by the end of the war renamed again as the RAF Air Construction Service (ACS). 
* In October 1920 the Yiewsley Urban District Council and the Uxbridge Rural District Council requested that the depot accommodation buildings at Stockley that had been used by the RNAS, be used for the housing of demobilised soldiers and sailors. However this was declined by the Secretary of State for War and Air, Winston Churchill.

* Between 1920 and 1923 public sales by auction of large quantities of the depot stores were held on behalf of the U.K. Government. 
=== RAF Reception Depot=== 
* On 1 September 1924 the West Drayton RAF Station became a reception depot for new entrants. Wing Commander Alexander Shekleton D.S.O. took command of the depot.

* On 30 October 1939 it became a Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) new-entrant depot.
=== Post Second World War ===
* The station was used to house 700 athletes competing at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, together with RAF Uxbridge and Richmond.
* From 1951 until 1962 the station accommodated the 3911th Air Base Group United States Air Force in addition to RAF personnel.

=== Air Traffic Control Operations===
The station became a unit of No. 11 Group RAF in January 1965.

RAF West Drayton was also the home of the Linesman System, hence the main Operations Building being known as the L1. The system used Link 1 to exchange Air Defence data between the UK and Europe. There were links to Continental Early Warning (CEW) sites at: Reitan, Maakeroy, Vaedbek, Nieuw-Milligen, Glons and Doulons.

Aerospace System Operators (ASOps or Scopies) were responsible for the tracking and identification of every flight – military and civil, that entered or left the UK Air Defence Region (UKADR). This was a labour-intensive task in the days before automatic initiation and tracking systems, but a big improvement on the plotting table and small perspex plaques with information written on them. The School of Fighter Control continued to teach plotting and writing backwards until 1990.

The School of Fighter Control moved to RAF West Drayton from RAF Bawdsey, training junior officers to be Fighter Controllers. In addition to teaching RAF officers, foreign and commonwealth students also attended, and there was even one course of Yugoslavian MiG pilots.

The station also became responsible for collecting and analysing many reports of UFOs after information was received by the Ministry of Defence.

===Closure and redevelopment===

West Drayton ceased being an RAF station in April 1994. At this time the English Electric Lightning acting as a gate guardian was scrapped; only the nose section was retained and sent to the Malta Aviation Museum. Air traffic control services remained, although the section responsible for airspace outside London moved to Swanwick in Hampshire in 2002. The remaining operation was named the London Terminal Control Centre. RAF personnel remained on the site, as military air traffic control functions for the eastern side of England remained. In November 2007 the remaining civil air traffic control services moved to Swanwick and were joined by the military operation in January 2008. National Air Traffic Services vacated the site in 2008. The MT section of the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron relocated to RAF Northolt.

Plans for 773 homes, a nursing home, shops and offices were approved by the London Borough of Hillingdon in July 2010. Inland Homes named the new development &quot;Drayton Garden Village&quot;, aiming to create a 1930s style village. Demolition work of the former air traffic control site was carried out between 2010 and 2011. The Drayton Garden Village development opened officially on 21 October 2011, with a ceremony led by the Mayor of Hillingdon. A later housing development, Park West, was constructed on the western side of the site.

<text>Paul Tanner (October 15, 1917 – February 5, 2013) was an American musician and a member of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. He developed and played the Electro-Theremin, a theremin soundalike instrument that is best known for its use on the Beach Boys 1966 songs &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times,&quot; &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;.

==Early life==
Paul Ora Warren Tanner was born on October 15, 1917, in Skunk Hollow, Campbell County, Kentucky. Tanner had five brothers, and each could play an instrument. Tanner learned to play the trombone at a reform school where his father was employed as superintendent. Tanner and his brothers were playing in what he described as a &quot;strip joint&quot; when Miller heard him and offered him a position in his band.

==Career==
Tanner gained fame as a trombonist, playing with Glenn Miller and His Orchestra from 1938 to 1942, the group&#x27;s entire duration. When it disbanded, Tanner joined the U.S. Army Air Force, becoming a part of the 378th Army Service Forces Band at Ft Slocum, New York. He later worked as a studio musician in Hollywood.

Tanner earned three degrees at University of California, Los Angeles – a bachelor&#x27;s in 1958 (graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot;), a master&#x27;s in 1961, and a doctorate in 1975. He also was influential in launching UCLA&#x27;s highly regarded jazz education program in 1958. He then became a professor at UCLA and also authored or co-authored several academic and popular histories related to jazz.

==Electro-Theremin==

He developed and played the Electro-Theremin, an electronic musical instrument that mimics the sound of the theremin. He can be heard performing on the opening title theme music of the 1963–66 CBS-TV comedy series &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. The Electro-Theremin is featured on several 1966–1967 recordings by The Beach Boys, with Tanner as the guest player; most notably on the Capitol Records singles &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, in the album track &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made For These Times&quot;, and in Dennis Wilson&#x27;s song &quot;Tune L&quot; found in the 1967 archival release &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot;.

==Death==
Tanner died of pneumonia on February 5, 2013, at the age of 95. He was the fourth-to-last surviving member of the Glenn Miller Orchestra, being surpassed by bassist Trigger Alpert, who died ten months later, trombonist Nat Peck, who died in 2015, and trumpeter Ray Anthony, who is living.

<text>Absolute Classic Rock is a national digital radio station owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Absolute Radio Network. Its music output is non-stop classic rock hits.

Formerly known as Virgin Radio Classic Rock, it originally was an internet-only radio station, and launched in 2000 under the name Virgin Classic by Lee Roberts, SMG Radio Director. On DAB Digital Radio in London, the station launched at 12:15pm with Richard Skinner introducing Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;. The launch time, presenter, and song (though not the artist) were identical to its parent station Virgin Radio.

On 1 September 2008 it was announced that Virgin Radio Classic Rock would be rebranded as Absolute Classic Rock on 29 September 2008.

The station was removed from Freesat channel 725 on 8 December 2011 because of &quot;economic realities&quot;. On 13 December 2023, Absolute Radio Classic Rock was removed from Sky and Virgin Media, along with every other radio station owned by Bauer Media on either platform, including Absolute Radio, Absolute Radio 80s, Absolute Radio 90s, Hits Radio, Greatest Hits Radio, Kiss, Magic, Jazz FM and Planet Rock.

==DAB expansion==
On 10 December 2010 Absolute Classic Rock expanded on DAB from London, taking over from Global Radio owned Gold on DAB in the North of England where there were 10 million potential new listeners on DAB in Newcastle, Sunderland, Darlington, Middlesbrough, Leeds, Hull, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, York, Huddersfield, Doncaster, Harrogate, Bradford, Sheffield, Blackburn, Preston, Blackpool, Bolton, Lancaster, Liverpool, Chester, Wrexham (North Wales) and Warrington.

On 20 December 2010 Absolute Classic Rock launched on DAB to a potential new 3 million new listeners in Ayr, Bath, Cardiff, Coventry and Exeter.

In 2011 it was confirmed by Ofcom that to accommodate the launch of new sister station Absolute Radio 60s, the reduction of the broadcast bitrate of Absolute Classic Rock would be permitted on the various multiplexes on which it broadcasts.

On 16 October 2023, Absolute Radio Classic Rock began broadcasting nationally on DAB+, broadcasting in stereo.

===West Midlands changes===
On 7 January 2019, Bauer closed Free Radio 80s and replaced it with Greatest Hits Radio West Midlands. It launched the station on its 105.2 FM frequency which covers Birmingham and the Black Country and Bauer chose to allocate its AM frequencies which cover that area to Absolute Classic Rock. This was the first time that the station had been available on analogue radio. Transmissions on 990 and 1017 kHz ceased on 30 April 2020, with the service remaining on 1152 kHz until 30 June 2020, when that also ceased.

==Notable former presenters==
Former presenters include Richard Skinner, Tommy Vance and Alice Cooper.

<doc id="1002246" wikidata="Q1937846" url="?curid=1002246" title="Mir (title)">
<text>Mir (, , ) (which is derived from the Arabic title &quot;Emir&quot; &#x27;elite, general, prince&#x27;) is a Persian, Kurdish and Balochi title with variable connotations.

== Etymology ==
The term Mir has its roots in the Arabic equivalent Emir, which means Prince or General. &quot;Emir&quot; is derived from the Arabic root a-m-r, &quot;command&quot;. Its other variations are Miran (plural of Mir), Mirzadeh, and Mirza

== Tribal Princes of the Persian Sunni Sayyids ==
Mir is the Persian version of the title of tribal leaders of Sayyids, that are addressed in the arabic world as Naqib. Examples for Persian Miran (Plural of Mir) are Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani and the family of the Mir Sayyid Hasan bin Azimullah and Hazrat Ishaan, that are today known as Dakik Family.

== Tribal Princes of the Kurdish Yazidis ==
In the Yazidi culture, the Mîr is the religious and also the administrative authority from the Qatani branch of the Sheikh caste. The former Mir was Tahseen Said Beg, whose son Hazim bin Tahsin Said and nephew Naif ben Dawood contest leadership.

== British Empire ==
The title Mir is also used by various vassals of the British Empire, who are neither Sayyids nor Yezidi.

=== Examples ===
In Muslim princely states of British India, a few rulers were formally styled &quot;Mir&quot;, notably in present Pakistan, where only two of the six have actually reached the level of salute state, becoming entitled to a gun salute and the attached form of address &quot;His Highness&quot;:
* the Mir of Morni, Garhi Kotaha and Pindrawal part of then Punjab Province and United Province. British India now Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh India
* the Mir of Khayrpur (Khairpur) (17 guns), a Rajputana part of present Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province, under a branch of the Talpur clan
* the Mir of Hunza (15 guns)

The following all remained non-salute states:

* The Mir of Mirpur State, under a branch of the above Talpur clan, in Sind(h)
* The Mir of Kharan; from 1921, restyled Sardar Bahador Nawab, till 1940 a vassal of the Khan and Wali of Khalat (the senior ruler in British/Pakistani Baluchistan)

<text>In cryptography, N-hash is a cryptographic hash function based on the FEAL round function, and is now considered insecure. It was proposed in 1990 in an article by Miyaguchi, Ohta, and Iwata; weaknesses were published the following year.

N-hash has a 128-bit hash size. A message is divided into 128-bit blocks, and each block is combined with the hash value computed so far using the &quot;g&quot; compression function. &quot;g&quot; contains eight rounds, each of which uses an &quot;F&quot; function, similar to the one used by FEAL.

Eli Biham and Adi Shamir (1991) applied the technique of differential cryptanalysis to N-hash, and showed that collisions could be generated faster than by a birthday attack for N-hash variants with even up to 12 rounds.

<text>Ronan Tynan (born 14 May 1960) is an Irish tenor singer and former Paralympic athlete.

He was a member of The Irish Tenors re-joining in 2011 while continuing to pursue his solo career since May 2004. In the United States, audiences know him for his involvement with that vocal group and for his renditions of &quot;God Bless America.&quot; He is also known for participating in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics.

==Life and career==
Tynan was born in Dublin, Ireland. His family home is in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Ireland. He was born with phocomelia, causing both of his lower legs to be underdeveloped; his legs were unusually short (he is now 6-foot 4), his feet were splayed outward, and he had three toes on each foot. He was one of a set of twins; his twin brother Edmond died at 11 months old. At age 20, he had his legs amputated below the knee, after a back injury from a car accident; the injury to his back made it impossible for him to continue using prosthetic legs without the amputation. Within weeks of the accident, he was climbing stairs at his college dormitory on artificial legs. Within a year, Tynan was winning in international competitions in track and field athletics. He represented Ireland in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics, winning four golds, two silvers, and one bronze medal. Between 1981 and 1984, he won 18 gold medals from various competitions and set 14 world records.

In the following years, Tynan became the first person with a disability to be admitted to the National College of Physical Education, in Limerick. He worked for about two years in the prosthetics industry, then went to Trinity College, became a physician specialising in Orthopedic Sports Injuries, and graduated in 1993.

Encouraged to also study voice by his father Edmund, Tynan won a series of voice competition awards and joined the Irish Tenors.

A devout Roman Catholic, Tynan has appeared on Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN). At the invitation of New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, he sang at the Archbishop&#x27;s installation Mass in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on 15 April 2009.

===Presidential performances===
As a very close friend of the Bush family, Tynan has performed in several events President George W. Bush has attended. Some of them include:

*State funerals of two presidents:
**Ronald Reagan
**George H. W. Bush
*George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 80th birthday
*Prayer service marking George W. Bush&#x27;s second inauguration
*Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day reception with President Bush and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern
*2008 President&#x27;s Dinner

===Other performances===

Tynan has sung &quot;God Bless America&quot; at sporting event venues, such as Yankee Stadium (during New York Yankees home Major League Baseball games, including Opening Day, nationally televised games, the last game at the old Yankee Stadium, and playoff games) and on several occasions prior to games involving the National Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres including a performance before 71,217 fans at the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic along with Sabres anthem singer Doug Allen, who performed the Canadian national anthem, on 1 January 2008, when the Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins. Tynan has not performed for the Sabres since Terrence Pegula purchased the team in 2011. Most recently, he sang Eagles Wings at the 2017 Memorial Day Concert.

In 2004 he sang Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot; at the Belmont Stakes where Smarty Jones failed in his attempt to win the Triple Crown. and less than a week later he was at the Washington National Cathedral for former United States President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s state funeral, where he sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

Tynan sang for George H. W. Bush at Bush&#x27;s Houston home on the day of the president&#x27;s death on 30 November 2018. The first song was &quot;Silent Night&quot;, while the second was a Gaelic song. Bush&#x27;s friend and former aide James Baker said that while Tynan was singing &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;[b]elieve it or not, the president was mouthing the words.&quot;

===&quot;As long as they&#x27;re not Jewish&quot; controversy===
While a real estate agent and prospective buyer Dr. Gabrielle Gold-von Simson were looking at an apartment in Tynan&#x27;s building on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, Tynan made what was construed to be an anti-Semitic remark. Shortly after this, the Yankees cancelled Tynan&#x27;s performance of &quot;God Bless America&quot; for Game 1 of the 2009 American League Championship Series on 16 October 2009 because of the incident.

According to Tynan&#x27;s version of the event, two Jewish women came to view an apartment in his building. Some time afterwards, another real estate agent showed up with a potential client. The agent joked to Tynan &quot;at least they&#x27;re not (Boston) Red Sox fans&quot;. &quot;As long as they&#x27;re not Jewish,&quot; Tynan replied, referring to the exacting women he had met earlier. The prospective client, Jewish paediatrician Dr. Gabrielle Gold-Von Simson, took umbrage and said: &quot;Why would you say that?&quot; Tynan replied: &quot;That would be scary&quot;, and laughed, referring to the previous incident. Tynan subsequently apologised for his remark. The Anti-Defamation League accepted his apology. Tynan performed at an ADL event in Manhattan soon thereafter.

Only 4 July 2010 Tynan performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; for the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park with the support of some in the local Jewish community.

<text>Mir of Hunza was the title of rulers of Hunza in the Hunza Valley in the Northern Areas, Pakistan.

== Etymology ==
The Mir used to have the Burushaski title of Thum (also &quot;Tham&quot; or &quot;Thom&quot;), later changed to Mir, a Persian form of the Arabic title &quot;Emir&quot;.

== Timeline ==
** Mir Salim Khan I
** Mir Shah Sultan Khan
** Mir Shahbaz Khan (1710 - Unknown)
** Mir Shahbeg Khan
** Mir Shah Khisrow Khan (1750 - 1790)
** Mir Mirza Khan (1790)
** Mir Salim Khan II (1790 - 1825)
** Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan I (1825 - 1864)
** Mir Muhammad Ghazan Khan I (1864 - 1886)
** Mir Safdar Ali Khan (1886 - 1891)
*** Mir Safdar fled to China after conquest of Hunza and Nagar States by British Forces in December 1891.Prince Muhammad Nafis Khan was the main contender of Mir-ship of Hunza on the grounds that he was the elder son of Mir Muhammad Ghazan Khan-I and has the legitimate right to be appointed as Mir of Hunza but His younger brother Nazim Khan was placed in his position by British Raj in September 1892.
** Mir Muhammad Nazim Khan (1892 - 1938)
** Mir Muhammad Ghazan Khan II (1938 - 1945)
** Mir Muhammad Jamal Khan (1945 - 1976)
*** Jamal Khan was last ruling Mir of Hunza. His powers were abolished in the dissolution of Hunza state by Z.A. Bhutto on 25 September 1974.
** Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan II (title in pretense, 1976 – present)

== Abolishment ==
In 1974 the state became a part of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan under the Pakistani Federal Government. The last Mir of Hunza was Mir Muhammad Jamal Khan.

== Current Situation ==
In the years to follow, the title of Mir was used as symbol of respect for the former Mirs of Hunza. Consequently, Mir Mohammad Jamal Khan&#x27;s eldest son, Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan (born 31 December 1945), uses the title of Mir on his official documents. Amongst other benefits to the former rulers, the federal Government also pays a privy purse or a monthly stipend to the current Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan. The family is also allowed to retain the former vehicle number plates bearing &#x27;Hunza&#x27;.

After the abolition of Hunza State, the Northern Areas, now known as Gilgit-Baltistan region, fell under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan contested the elections several times from his hometown of Karimabad and served as a member of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly. His last position of prominence was as Leader of the House and the first Chief Minister of Gilgit-Baltistan under the rule of President Musharraf.

In the general election of 2009, Mir Ghazanfar&#x27;s son Prince Shehryar Khan (born 5 June 1977) contested the election in place of his father but did not succeed in securing the majority votes from the region; however, he won by a majority in his hometown of Karimabad.

<doc id="1002256" wikidata="Q261338" url="?curid=1002256" title="Shot clock">
<text>A shot clock is a countdown timer used in a variety of games and sports, indicating a set amount of time that a team may possess the object of play before attempting to score a goal. Shot clocks are used in several sports including basketball, water polo, canoe polo, lacrosse, poker, ringette, korfball, tennis, ten-pin bowling, and various cue sports. It is analogous with the play clock used in American and Canadian football, and the pitch clock used in baseball. This article deals chiefly with the shot clock used in basketball.

The set amount of time for a shot clock in basketball is 24–35 seconds, depending on the league. This clock reveals how much time a team may possess the ball before attempting to score a field goal. It may be colloquially known as the 24-second clock, particularly in the NBA and other leagues where that is the duration of the shot clock. If the shot clock reaches zero before the team attempts a field goal, the team has committed a shot clock violation, which is penalized with a loss of possession.

At most professional and collegiate basketball courts the shot clock is displayed to the players and spectators in large red numerals below the game clock on a display mounted atop each backboard. In some collegiate and amateur facilities this display might be located on the floor or mounted to a wall behind the end line. A shot clock is used in conjunction with a game clock but is distinct from the game clock which displays the time remaining in the period of play.

The shot clock was originally introduced in the NBA in 1954 as a way to increase scoring and reduce stalling tactics that were commonly used before its inception. It has been credited with increasing fan interest in the then-fledgling league, and has since been adopted at most organized levels of basketball.

==Definition==
The shot clock is a digital clock that displays a number of seconds or not. The shot clock is usually displayed above the backboard behind each goal, allowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they have to shoot and officials to easily determine whether buzzer beaters should be counted. The NBA specifies that a transparent shot clock and game clock that displays said times on both sides be part of the backboard assembly, and FIBA, EuroLeague, and many venues use this arrangement.

Three signals indicate when the time to shoot has expired:
*A value of 0.0 on the shot clock itself
*An audible horn distinct from the scoreboard operator&#x27;s signal for end of period and substitutions
*A yellow strip of lights (LEDs) on the backboard. The NBA (since 2011) and FIBA (since July 2018) require this. This is not explicitly required in the NCAA, although some venues will use the red LEDs surrounding most shot clocks or on the backboard (used in the NBA to signal the end of period) to denote a shot clock violation.

In the final five seconds to shoot, the shot clock displays tenths of seconds. This was adopted in the 2011–12 NBA season.

==History==
The NBA has had a 24-second limit since 1954. FIBA introduced a 30-second shot clock in 1956 and switched to 24 seconds in 2000. The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) had a 30-second clock originally and switched to 24 seconds in 2006. Collegiate basketball uses a 30-second shot clock (details below).

===Background===

The NBA had problems attracting fans (and positive media coverage) before the shot clock&#x27;s inception. Teams in the lead were running out the clock, passing the ball incessantly. The trailing team could do nothing but commit fouls to recover possession following the free throw. Frequent low-scoring games with many fouls bored fans. The most extreme case occurred on November 22, 1950, when the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers by a record-low score of 19–18, including 3–1 in the fourth quarter. The Pistons held the ball for minutes at a time without shooting (they attempted 13 shots for the game) to limit the impact of the Lakers&#x27; dominant George Mikan. It led the &quot;St. Paul Dispatch&quot; to write, &quot;[The Pistons] gave pro basketball a great black eye.&quot; NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, &quot;In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores.&quot; A few weeks after the Pistons/Lakers game, the Rochester Royals and Indianapolis Olympians played a six-overtime game with only one shot in each overtime: in each overtime period, the team that had the ball first held it for the entirety of the period before attempting a last-second shot. The NBA tried several rule changes in the early 1950s to speed up the game and reduce fouls before eventually adopting the shot clock.

===Creation===
In 1954 in Syracuse, New York, Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers) owner Danny Biasone and general manager Leo Ferris experimented with a 24-second shot clock during a scrimmage. Jack Andrews, longtime basketball writer for &quot;The Syracuse Post-Standard&quot;, often recalled how Ferris would sit at Danny Biasone&#x27;s Eastwood bowling alley, scribbling potential shot clock formulas onto a napkin. According to Biasone, &quot;I looked at the box scores from the games I enjoyed, games where they didn&#x27;t screw around and stall. I noticed each team took about 60 shots. That meant 120 shots per game. So I took 2,880 seconds (48 minutes) and divided that by 120 shots. The result was 24 seconds per shot.&quot; Ferris was singled out by business manager Bob Sexton at the 1954 team banquet for pushing the shot clock rule. Biasone and Ferris then convinced the NBA to adopt it for the 1954–55 season, a season in which the Nationals won the NBA Championship
===Models===
Originally, the shot clocks used in the NBA were usually single-sided in a black box. A 1991 rule change required game clocks to be included with shot clocks in the NBA. Eventually, after the rule change, multiple-sided began to be used, and would be in most of the arenas. A 2002 NBA rule change allowing instant replay review of last-second shots required four-sided units in NBA venues, along with an accompanying shot clock light to determine if the shot went off in time. In 2005, the FedExForum in Memphis opened with a new two-sided transparent shot clock developed by Daktronics with a smaller secondary version also accompanying the larger one. By the 2010&#x27;s, the twin shot clock format, used by Daktronics and Canadian rival OES, became the standard for most venues, especially in NCAA play. In the 2014-15 season, the NBA signed a deal with Tissot, a Swiss watch company, for specification two-sided transparent shot clock, which was thinner than its predecessors. But in many international leagues and the collegiate level, the older 3-sided and 4-sided shot clocks are still in use, except for Daktronics, OES, and SwissTiming/Tissot venues.

===Adoption by other leagues===
Two later pro leagues that rivaled the NBA adopted a modified version of the shot clock. The American Basketball League used a 30-second shot clock for its two years in existence The American Basketball Association also adopted a 30-second clock when it launched in switching to the NBA&#x27;s 24-second length for its final season 

From its inception in 1975, the Philippine Basketball Association adopted a 25-second shot clock. This was because the shot clocks then installed at the league&#x27;s main venues, the Araneta Coliseum and Rizal Memorial Coliseum (the latter no longer used by the league), could only be set at 5-second intervals. The league later adopted a 24-second clock starting from the 1995 season. The Metropolitan Basketball Association in the Philippines used the 23-second clock from its maiden season in 1998. In Philippine college basketball, the NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines) and the UAAP Basketball Championship adopted a 30-second clock, then switched to 24 seconds starting with the 2001–02 UAAP season 64, the first season to start after the FIBA rule change in 2001.

==Operation==
The shot clock begins counting down when a team establishes possession, and stops any time the game clock stops (e.g., timeouts, violations, fouls). The offensive team must attempt to score a field goal before the shot clock expires; otherwise, the team has committed a shot clock violation (also known as a 24-second violation in leagues with a 24-second shot clock) that results in a turnover to their opponents. An important distinction is that there is no violation if the ball is in flight to the basket when the shot clock expires, as long as the ball leaves the player&#x27;s hand before the shot clock expires and the ball proceeds to go into the basket or touch the basket rim.

The shot clock resets to its full length at the start of each period and whenever possession changes to the opposite team such as after a basket is scored, the defense steals the ball or recovers a rebound, or the offense commits a foul or violation. The full length varies by country, level of play, and league; see the table below. The shot clock does not reset if a defender makes short contact with the ball (e.g., an attempted steal or a tipped pass) but the offense retains possession, or if a shot attempt misses the rim entirely and airballs. The shot clock also resets when the offense retains possession after a missed field goal or free throw, or on certain fouls or violations that give the offense an inbounds pass in their frontcourt. 

If the offensive team is fouled and the penalty does not include free throws but just an in-bounds pass, the shot clock is reset. There are several cases where the offense is not given a full 24 seconds. The shot clock is instead set to 14 following an offensive rebound. FIBA adopted this in 2014 and the NBA adopted in 2018. The WNBA also observes this rule. In several other cases where the offense inbounds the ball in its frontcourt (such as a foul by the defense not resulting in free throws), the offense is guaranteed 14 seconds. The shot clock is increased to 14 if it showed a shorter time.

On a held ball (whether decided by a jump ball or a possession arrow), the state of the shot clock depends on which team gets possession of the ball.
*If the defensive team acquires possession, the shot clock is reset, as it is on any other change of possession.
*If the offense retains possession, the shot clock is not reset, because there was no change of possession. However, in Euroleague, the NBA, and WNBA, the shot clock is topped up to 14 seconds, as described above for a frontcourt inbounds pass.

Near the end of each period, if the shot clock would ordinarily display more time than there is remaining in the period, the shot clock is switched off. During this time, a team cannot commit a shot clock violation.

The shot clock apparatus itself is considered out of bounds and not part of the backboard. The shot clock operator sits at the scorer&#x27;s table. This is usually a different person from the scoreboard operator, as the task requires concentration during and after the shot attempt. In the 2016-17 NBA season, a new &#x27;official timekeeper&#x27; deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer Tissot introduced technology to unify the keeping of the shot clock and the game clock. Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the 2017 season.

===Collegiate rules===
American collegiate basketball uses a 30-second shot clock, while Canadian university basketball uses a 24-second clock.

In men&#x27;s collegiate basketball, there was initial resistance to the implementation of a shot clock for men&#x27;s NCAA basketball, due to fears that smaller colleges would be unable to compete with powerhouses in a running game. However, after extreme results like an 11–6 Tennessee win over Temple in 1973, support for a men&#x27;s shot clock began to build. The NCAA introduced a 45-second shot clock for the 1985-86 season; several conferences had experimented with it for the two seasons prior. It was reduced in the 1993–94 season, and in the 2015–16 season. The NAIA also reduced the shot clock to 30 seconds starting in 2015–16.

Women&#x27;s collegiate basketball (at the time sanctioned by the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) used a 30-second shot clock on an experimental basis in the 1969–70 season, officially adopting it for the 1970–71 season.

The NCAA specifies 20 seconds rather than 30 after stoppages where the ball is already in the frontcourt. In 2019, it added offensive rebounds to this list.

===US high schools rules===
The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which sets rules for high school basketball in the U.S., does not mandate the use of a shot clock, instead leaving the choice to use a clock and its duration up to each individual state association. In concert with this, the &quot;stall ball&quot; strategy can be used in a state or league, but depending on the organization, itself comes with restrictions on its use by the game officials, with overuse of it often being whistled as a foul or an unsportsmanlike act. Others may allow stalling completely, at the risk of fan disinterest.

As the cost of a shot clock system can be cost-prohibitive, its use in high schools has been debated on that consideration and not the flow of the game. While previous proposals for a national shot clock had been denied by the NFHS as recently as 2011, in the spring of 2021 the NFHS agreed to allow its member associations the option of a shot clock, with a mandatory 35-second duration, starting in 2022–23.

As of August 2021, 11 states either require a shot clock in high school competition or will begin using one starting in 2022–23: California, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska (Class A only), New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Washington. Before 2022–23, the District of Columbia used a 30-second shot clock for public school (DCIAA) competition, charter school competition (as of 2018–19), and for the DCSAA State Tournament, where public, private, and charter schools compete for the championship of the District of Columbia.

A related rule to speed up play is that the offensive team has a limited time to advance the ball across the half-court line (the &quot;time line&quot;).

<text>Richard James Foster (born 1942) is a Christian theologian and author in the Quaker tradition. His writings speak to a broad Christian audience. Born in 1942 in New Mexico, Foster spent the majority of his childhood growing up in Southern California. Foster has been a professor at Friends University and pastor of Evangelical Friends churches. Foster resides in Denver, Colorado. He earned his undergraduate degree at George Fox University in Oregon and his Doctor of Pastoral Theology at Fuller Theological Seminary, and received an honorary doctorate from Houghton College.

Foster is best known for his 1978 book &quot;Celebration of Discipline&quot;, which examines the inward disciplines of prayer, fasting, meditation, and study in the Christian life, the outward disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service, and the corporate disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration. It has sold over one million copies. It was named by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; as one of the top ten books of the twentieth century. A work described as a sequel to &quot;Celebration&quot; is Foster&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Money, Sex &amp; Power&quot;. and associated study guide.

He also published &quot;Freedom of Simplicity&quot; in 1981, which further explores the discipline of simple, intentional living. &quot;Prayer: Finding the Heart&#x27;s True Home&quot; (1992, ), which explores 21 different types of Christian prayer, edited &quot;Devotional Classics&quot; (1993, ), a devotional guide featuring Christian wisdom through the ages, and &quot;Streams of Living Water&quot; (2001, ), which examines the place of the different spiritual traditions - Contemplative: The Prayer-Filled Life; Holiness: The Virtuous Life; Charismatic: The Spirit-Empowered Life; Social Justice: The Compassionate Life; Evangelical: The Word-Centered Life; and Incarnational: The Sacramental Life - in Christianity. Sanctuary of the Soul: Journey Into Meditative Prayer

Foster (along with several others) also wrote the devotional &quot;Renovaré Spiritual Formation Bible&quot; (now published as &quot;The Life with God Study Bible&quot;). Two editions of this NRSV-based study Bible exist, one with the apocryphal/deuterocanonical texts and one without.

In 2008, he co-authored with Gayle Beebe, the book &quot;Longing for God&quot;.

In 1988 Foster founded &quot;Renovaré&quot;, a Christian renewal para-Church organization.

In recent years he has allowed his hair to grow, wearing it in a long pony tail. He says this is his way of honoring the portion of his heritage which is Ojibwe.

<doc id="1002268" wikidata="Q4723370" url="?curid=1002268" title="Alfred Rouse">
<text>Alfred Arthur Rouse (6 April 1894 – 10 March 1931) was a British murderer, known as the Blazing Car Murderer, who was convicted and subsequently hanged at Bedford Gaol for the November 1930 murder of an unknown man in Hardingstone, Northamptonshire. Rouse&#x27;s crime became known as the &quot;Blazing Car Murder&quot; due to the fact Rouse, seeking to fabricate his own death, burned to death an unknown hitchhiker whom he had rendered unconscious inside his car.

The murder was notable because the identity of the victim has never been established, resulting in Rouse being tried, convicted and executed for the murder of an unknown man. Despite recent DNA testing, the identity of the victim still remains unknown.

==Early life==
Alfred Arthur Rouse was born in Milkwood Road, Herne Hill, London on 6 April 1894, one of three children born to an English father and an Irish mother. His father, Walter, was a hosier, whereas his mother was reportedly an actress who deserted her husband and children in 1900. Following his wife&#x27;s leaving the household, Rouse&#x27;s father had little time for his children; consequently, Rouse and his two siblings were largely raised by an aunt on his father&#x27;s side. Rouse was known as a well-behaved child; he and his siblings attended a local council school where he was regarded as a bright and athletic student. A member of the Church of England, Rouse would later become a sacristan at St Saviour&#x27;s Church in Stoke Newington.

Upon leaving school at age 14, Rouse worked briefly as an office boy for an estate agent, then found more secure employment at a textile manufacturing firm. He worked at this firm for five years before training as a carpenter, all the while furthering his education by attending numerous evening classes. In addition, Rouse had a substantial musical gift, sang well, and learned how to play various musical instruments, becoming a proficient pianist, violinist, and mandolinist. Rouse&#x27;s exceptional baritone voice ensured that he regularly sang at his evening classes. In 1909, Rouse obtained employment at a West End furniture manufacturer. Shortly afterwards, he became acquainted with a young clerk named Lily May Watkins, whom he first met at a local dance and with whom he began a relationship.

==Wartime service==
Just four days after the outbreak of World War I, Rouse enlisted in the British Army and was assigned to the 24th Queen&#x27;s Regiment as a Private. While training in England before his departure for France, Rouse married his fiancée. This ceremony was conducted at St Saviour&#x27;s Church, St Albans, on 29 November.

Rouse arrived in France on 15 March 1915, and was stationed in Paris for some weeks before his unit was sent into battle. He would serve with distinction, although he is known to have fathered an illegitimate child during this time. Rouse&#x27;s unit was then committed to the Battle of Festubert in Artois, which began on 15 May. In a bayonet attack, Rouse came face to face with a German soldier and lunged at him but missed; the memory of waiting just for an instant for the enemy riposte would remain with him for the rest of his life, and his sleep would be plagued by nightmares.

On the last day of the Battle of Festubert (and just ten weeks after his arrival in France), Rouse sustained wounds to his head, knee and thigh from a high-explosive shell which exploded close to his head, sending numerous fragments of shrapnel into his head and leg and rendering him unconscious. Rouse did not regain consciousness until his hospital train passed through the town of Bedford en route to a UK Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit. As a result of his injuries, Rouse remained hospitalised for almost a year; undergoing several operations upon both his left temporal region—some of which were performed to remove embedded shrapnel—and his leg. Rouse&#x27;s leg injuries left him unable to bend his knee and caused him to develop œdema, severely affecting his ability to walk. Rouse was sent to recuperate at military hospitals in Leeds and, later, Clacton-on-Sea. He was formally discharged from the Army on 11 February 1916, and awarded a military pension of twenty shillings per week.

===Recuperation===
Following his recuperation, Rouse returned to live with his wife in Stoke Newington. Contemporary medical records reveal that, at this stage in his life, he was still severely disabled. In July 1916, Rouse&#x27;s doctor noted that his memory was defective and that he was unable to wear a hat of any kind because the scar around his temporal lobe was irritable. Furthermore, although Rouse&#x27;s speech and writing abilities were unaffected from this injury, one note in Rouse&#x27;s medical records reads: &quot;He sleeps well unless excited in any way&quot;. Consequently, Rouse&#x27;s military pension was raised to twenty-five shillings per week in August 1916.

In late January 1917, Rouse&#x27;s doctor discovered he had made a degree of progress in his recuperation from his leg injury and believed this injury could, by Rouse&#x27;s own endeavour, be overcome. A year later, Rouse informed his doctor he was suffering from bouts of dizziness, although the doctor noted how talkative he was; even &quot;[laughing] immoderately at times&quot;. In September 1918, Rouse again complained that he was suffering from a defective memory. Moreover, he complained on this occasion to be suffering from insomnia.

==Return to work==
On 30 July 1919, a doctor examining Rouse observed that, while he would not allow his knee to be flexed by more than 30 percent, he now suffered no long-term disability from the head wound he had suffered in battle. This doctor could find no physical reason for Rouse&#x27;s limitation of his knee movement. As such, this was ascribed to neurosis and his pension, which since September 1918 had been twenty-seven shillings and sixpence per week, was decreased to twelve shillings per week with effect from 17 September 1919. In August 1920, a final examination revealed his head injury had completely healed and the limitations of his knee movement had decreased dramatically. Rouse&#x27;s pension was terminated the following month, with his receiving a final lump payment of £41.5s.0d. in settlement of all his injury claims.

In an effort to regain his health and mobility, Rouse became an active member of a local tennis club. Beginning in 1920, he also undertook a number of jobs which required a degree of physical exertion. Many of these jobs involved the use of vehicles, resulting in Rouse&#x27;s becoming a moderately skilled mechanic. The same year, he also began to conduct illicit affairs in which he—invariably posing as a single man—seduced any woman or girl he found attractive. The first known woman he seduced was a 14-year-old Edinburgh girl whom he impregnated at age 15, then abandoned, leaving the girl to give birth to their child in a home for unwed mothers. Four years later, in 1925, Rouse began an affair with a Hendon-based domestic servant named Nellie Tucker. In 1928, Tucker gave birth to a baby girl; shortly thereafter, Tucker obtained a child support order (the first of many by various women) against Rouse.

In June 1929, Rouse found employment as a commercial traveller for a Leicester-based firm which primarily sold braces and garters, typically at locations around the South Coast and the Midlands. This employment earned Rouse £4 a week, with expenses paid each Friday, and a sales commission paid every month. Through this employment, Rouse managed to earn sufficient money for him and his wife to obtain a mortgage on a house on Buxted Road in the London borough of Friern Barnet. Furthermore, in the summer of 1930, he also purchased a 1928 Morris Minor.

===Promiscuity===
Because of both Rouse&#x27;s high sex drive and his general promiscuity, plus the fact his job required him to travel extensively across the entire country, throughout 1929 and 1930 he is known to have conducted a number of affairs with women—both married and single—whom he typically encountered through his employment. As with the Edinburgh 14-year-old and Tucker, many of these women came from poor backgrounds and would be deceived by Rouse&#x27;s charismatic personality, his fabrications of being a wealthy London entrepreneur, and his promises of marriage. Furthermore, despite already being married and the father of a child, he is also known to have bigamously married at least three of these women. As a result of these affairs, Rouse fathered a number of illegitimate children.

By the summer of 1930, Rouse had already had one child support order imposed on him by Tucker, with whom he had been conducting an affair for several years; Tucker was now heavily pregnant with their second child and fully expecting him to marry her. A young Welsh woman named Phyllis Jenkins had also been impregnated and was also fully expecting marriage in the near future. In addition, Rouse faced several other impending child support order cases from women across the country and one woman in Paris.

==Financial strain==
At just what point Rouse decided on his scheme is not settled, nor how he arrived at it, as following his arrest, he gave several contradictory accounts as to just how and when he devised his plan. However, Rouse did mention that initially, he had begun to think about committing a murder in which he could fake his own death after he had read reports of the murder of a young Scottish barmaid named Agnes Kesson, who had been found murdered in a rural lane in the market town of Epsom in June 1930, and whose murder would ultimately remain unsolved. Furthermore, Rouse would claim the decision for him to ultimately decide to fake his own death had been Tucker&#x27;s announcement to him in the summer of 1930 that she was expecting her second child by him (an illegitimate daughter would be born on 29 October).

According to Rouse, he had simply &quot;wanted to start afresh&quot;, yet to ensure the financial stability of his legal wife and his six-year-old son, he had drawn a life insurance policy for £1,000 in his name months before he executed his plan, to be paid in the event of the accidental death of the owner-driver of his vehicle. This life insurance policy named his legal wife as the beneficiary, and on either 2 or 3 November, he had sought out a man of roughly the same build as himself with whom he had become casually acquainted at a pub named the Swan and Pyramid whom Rouse claimed had previously told him &quot;the usual hard-luck story&quot;, and had informed him: &quot;Guv&#x27;nor, I&#x27;ve got nobody in the world that cares whether I live or die.&quot; In response, Rouse informed the man that, through his employment as a commercial traveller, he would be able to secure a job for him in the Midlands, and that he would be travelling to this location on 5 November.

In his later confession, Rouse specifically stated he had opted to time the fire in his car to be on Guy Fawkes Night, as &quot;a fire would not be noticed so much&quot; on this date due to the typical celebration rituals, and that his victim had readily agreed to accompany him to Leicester on 5 November, upon the promise of his possibly finding work in this city. To minimise any resistance from his victim, Rouse also bought the man a bottle of whisky to consume as he drove north.

==Murder==
At approximately 1:50 in the morning of 6 November 1930, two young men returning from a Guy Fawkes Night dance in the town of Northampton to their homes in the nearby village of Hardingstone saw a fire in the distance. As Guy Fawkes Night had just passed, the men assumed the pyre they could see in the distance was a bonfire. As they walked down Hardingstone Lane toward the fire in the direction of their homes, a neatly dressed man carrying an attaché case passed in the opposite direction. When one of the young men remarked as to the blaze he could see in the distance, Rouse nodded and exclaimed: &quot;It looks like somebody&#x27;s having a bonfire up there.&quot; He then walked past the two men before turning in the direction of the main Northampton-London road.

The two men approached the fire, only to discover the source of the flames was actually a Morris Minor ablaze in a verge at the side of the country lane, with the flames reaching up to twelve feet in height. Upon summoning the Hardingstone village constable, Harry Bertie Copping, and the parish constable to the scene, the four men extinguished the fire with water from a nearby pond, only to discover a charred corpse lying across the front seats, with the head on the driver&#x27;s seat, and the right arm burnt off at the elbow. Constable Copping would later recollect he had initially believed the skull of the victim was actually a scorched rugby ball. Crucially, a wooden mallet was found near the car, with three human hairs attached to the head. Although the fire had all but destroyed the vehicle, the number plate at the rear of the car was largely undamaged in the fire; thus, police were quickly able to determine it belonged to one Alfred Arthur Rouse of Friern Barnet.

When the two young men informed investigators of their encounter with the man at the end of Hardingstone Lane, police issued an appeal in both the local and national press, urging the man to come forward and assist them with their inquiries. The case was covered in detail in many national newspapers on 7 November.

==Forensic examination and enquiries==
A forensic examination of the vehicle revealed a joint on the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been loosened before the fire had ignited, thus allowing petrol to freely stream both into and beneath the car, indicating the blaze had been deliberate. Moreover, spectroscopic tests conducted upon the victim&#x27;s blood, and a microscopic examination of his air passages, revealed the victim had been alive, albeit unconscious, when the fire had started. Furthermore, he was estimated to have died within 30 seconds of the onset of the fire. The victim himself was estimated to have been between 33 and 37 years old, and due to the condition of his lungs, had likely worked in an extremely dusty atmosphere throughout his life.

Police visited Rouse&#x27;s Friern Barnet home to interview his wife. Mrs Rouse was able to confirm her husband had left home at approximately 8:30 p.m. on 5 November to attend a business meeting in Leicester, and that he had arrived home at a time she (incorrectly) believed to be approximately 2 a.m. the following morning, saying nothing. She was then asked to accompany police to Northampton to assist in the identification of the victim. Due to the actual condition of the remains, she was not allowed to see the body, but instead asked to confirm whether she could identify scraps of clothing and a wallet containing 30 shillings which had been found upon the victim. Mrs Rouse stated the items of clothing looked like those her husband had worn, but she could not be certain; the wallet had definitely belonged to her husband.

==Arrest==
Rouse himself had hitched a ride to London, arriving at his Friern Barnet home at approximately 6:20 a.m. He remained at his home for just 30 minutes before travelling by train to Glamorganshire to meet with Phyllis Jenkins (whom he had earlier promised to marry). When Jenkins asked Rouse where his car was, he replied that it had been stolen in Northamptonshire the previous day, and that this was why it had taken him 18 hours to reach her. He assured Jenkins that he had reported the theft to both the police and his insurance company. Early the following morning, Rouse&#x27;s mistress showed him a newspaper displaying an image of his burned-out car which speculated as to whether the deceased occupant had been the owner of the vehicle and questioning whether he had been murdered. In response, Rouse denied that the car was his, before announcing his intentions to travel by coach to Hammersmith Broadway. At 10 a.m. he boarded a coach at Cardiff destined for Hammersmith Broadway. When Rouse&#x27;s coach had departed, Jenkins informed local police that Rouse had been at her house and of his intended destination; they in turn informed the Metropolitan Police Service of his whereabouts. Consequently, that evening, Rouse was arrested at Hammersmith coach terminal by a Detective-Sergeant Skelly of the Metropolitan Police, who had been waiting for him at the coach terminal.

At the Hammersmith police station, Rouse was informed that officers from Northamptonshire Police were already travelling to Hammersmith to interview him. In response, Rouse offered a rambling statement in which he claimed his victim was a hitchhiker he had encountered near St Albans, and who had accidentally set his vehicle alight while he (Rouse) had left his vehicle to relieve himself. Rouse further claimed he was travelling to Scotland Yard to confess to his crime at the time of his arrest, adding: &quot;I am glad it&#x27;s all over. I was going to Scotland Yard about it. I was responsible. I am very glad it&#x27;s over. I have had no sleep.&quot; Upon the arrival of Northamptonshire police officers, Rouse was cautioned and driven to Northampton police station.

===Initial confession===
At Northampton police station, Rouse contradicted his earlier statement by claiming that he had encountered the victim hitchhiking along the Great North Road towards the Midlands and had offered the man a lift. He had driven to Hardingstone Lane accidentally, because he had lost his direction. At this location, he had stopped the vehicle to answer a call of nature and had asked his travelling companion, whom he had given a cigar, to fill the car&#x27;s petrol tank from a can in the boot. According to Rouse, when he looked back, the vehicle was ablaze, with the man trapped inside. He had, he claimed, attempted to open the door of the vehicle, but had been beaten back by the flames. In a state of panic as to his predicament, he had fled from the scene.

Upon being confronted with the forensic evidence that the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been loosened, Rouse remained adamant the fire had been accidental, offering conjecture it may have been started by the inebriated victim lighting the cigar he had been given after he had filled the petrol tank of his vehicle and accidentally spilled some of the contents of the petrol tank inside his vehicle. Furthermore, when questioned as to why he had been seen by the two young men walking from the scene of the fire with a briefcase in his hand, Rouse claimed he had taken the briefcase out of the car because he had earlier noticed the man had placed his hand upon it.

On 27 November, Rouse appeared at Northampton assizes to be formally charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was remanded into custody until 3 December. On this date, a formal trial date of 26 January was set.

==Trial==
The trial of Alfred Rouse began at the Northampton winter assizes on 26 January 1931. He was tried before Mr. Justice Talbot. The chief prosecuting counsel for the Crown was William Norman Birkett KC; he was assisted by Richard Elwes. The chief defence counsel was Donald Finnemore, who was assisted by A. P. Marshall. On this date, Rouse formally pleaded not guilty to the charge of the murder of an unknown man.

===Witness testimony===
Throughout his trial, Rouse stuck to his claim the death of the unknown man had been accidental. To support this contention, Donald Finnemore introduced an engineer who testified that in many instances, excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of the joint on the feeding pipe, and as such, Rouse&#x27;s contention the victim had inadvertently set the vehicle ablaze could be true. This claim was refuted by both Sir Bernard Spilsbury and Dr. Eric Shaw, who had together performed an autopsy upon the unidentified victim and who were each called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Both men testified that the victim had been alive and unconscious when the fire had been started, and that the mallet found near the Morris Minor had likely been the weapon used to club the victim about the head prior to the inception of the fire. Spilsbury further testified that one of the few fragments of clothing found upon the victim not to have been destroyed in the fire was a section of the fork of the victim&#x27;s trousers, which was found to be soaked in petrol, thus corroborating the prosecution&#x27;s contention that Rouse had extensively doused both his victim and his vehicle in petrol before setting his vehicle ablaze. This forensic claim would be challenged by the defence, who alleged the petrol stain supported Rouse&#x27;s claims the victim may have spilled the petrol over himself while lunging in a drunken stupor.

Another witness to refute the accidental death theory was a vehicular expert who had studied the remains of the Morris Minor, and who testified that a joint on the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been forcibly loosened to allow petrol to flow into and beneath the motor, thus discrediting earlier defence claims that excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of this particular joint. (At one stage as Rouse stood in the witness box to reiterate his claims the fire had been accidental, prosecuting attorney William Norman Birkett placed the actual carburettor of Rouse&#x27;s vehicle in his hands, causing Rouse to become visibly nervous as he attempted to explain earlier witness testimony as to the forcible loosening of the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and carburettor of his vehicle.)

The prosecution contention at Rouse&#x27;s trial was that the actual motive behind Rouse&#x27;s committing this murder had been to fabricate his own death in order that he could escape the financial constraints brought about by his numerous affairs, and to simply start his life afresh. To emphasise this, William Birkett called three of his mistresses to testify, explaining to the jury the testimony of these women would illustrate that &quot;Rouse&#x27;s domestic life was not what it should have been&quot;. Also to testify was a Government fire and insurance inspector named Colonel Cuthbert Buckle, who demonstrated to the jury how, in his view, the fire had been deliberately started by what he termed &quot;human agency&quot;, with a deliberate loosening of the locknut of the petrol feeding pipe.

Rouse himself testified in his own defence at his trial. Despite the brief episode of nervousness he had displayed when handling the carburettor as he answered the prosecution&#x27;s questions as to the loosening of his vehicle&#x27;s feeding pipe, he often displayed an air of confidence as he reiterated his claims the death of the unknown victim had been accidental. He would often perform poorly in the witness box; repeatedly being forced to either admit to the contradictions in the earlier statements he had provided to police and his current claims, or that he had lied about his actions or movements. He could not, for instance, explain why he had falsely claimed to his mistress in Glamorganshire that his car had been stolen in Northamptonshire and that he had reported the theft to police, or why this mistress had earlier testified that when he had arrived at her house on 6 November he had smelled of petrol, and his eyebrows had appeared slightly scorched.

==Conviction==
The trial lasted just six days. In a final address to the jury Mr. Justice Talbot stated thus: &quot;Of course, there can be no doubt about it that these facts create grave suspicion against this man who was the owner of the car, and who drove it to the place where it was burned. If he is an innocent man he has created a grave suspicion against himself by his own folly.&quot;

The jury debated for just 25 minutes before reaching their verdict: Rouse was unanimously found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 31 January. Having calmly heard the verdict, just prior to the sentence of death being imposed, Rouse firmly declared to Mr. Justice Talbot, &quot;I am innocent, sir.&quot; Rouse did lodge an appeal against his conviction, primarily contending immoral character evidence had been submitted at his trial, and that this had influenced the jury. His appeal was heard on 23 February 1931, although it would prove unsuccessful.

===Execution===
On Tuesday, 10 March 1931, Rouse was hanged in Bedford Gaol. In the days prior to his execution, his legal wife and two of his mistresses alternately visited him to bid him a final farewell.

Rouse never formally admitted his guilt to the murder of his victim to the police, although shortly before his execution, he did write a letter to the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; in which he confessed his guilt. In this written confession, Rouse stated that initially, he had resisted the thoughts he had initially developed that summer to commit a murder in which he could fabricate his own death, although a chance encounter with the unknown victim outside a London pub in the autumn of 1930 had led him to rethink his plans.

In this written confession, Rouse stated that as he had driven his intended victim to the Midlands, he had encouraged him to drink from the bottle of whisky he had purchased in order to inebriate him before turning onto Hardingstone Lane. At this location, he had strangled the victim to the point of unconsciousness before loosening the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and the carburettor of his vehicle; he had then taken the petrol can from the boot and poured petrol on both the victim and about his car before placing the petrol tank in the rear of his car and, standing from a distance, setting the vehicle ablaze with a match.

Initially, Rouse had intended to walk to Northampton and travel to Scotland via train to begin life afresh; however, when he had seen the two young men returning from a Guy Fawkes Night dance at the end of Hardingstone Lane, he realised people would know he was not the victim in the car; therefore, after briefly returning to his London home with a hastily concocted story of his car having been stolen, he had opted to travel to Glamorganshire to meet with one of his mistresses. When he read extensive accounts of the murder in the Welsh press in which he was named as the prime suspect, he had travelled to Hammersmith Broadway, where he was arrested.

In this confession, published after his execution, Rouse again stated he had never asked his victim&#x27;s name, claiming &quot;there was no reason why I should do so&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The body of Rouse&#x27;s victim was interred in a grave marked with a simple cross bearing the inscription &quot;In Memory of an Unknown Man. Died Nov. 6, 1930&quot; in the grounds of St. Edmund&#x27;s Church in Hardingstone, Northamptonshire. A metal box containing several newspaper accounts of Rouse&#x27;s trial was buried with the victim. A new cross was erected above the grave in August 2022.

Prior to his execution, Rouse refused to assist police in establishing the identity of his victim, simply stating his belief he should not assist officers in this task &quot;as they have not helped me&quot;. He did, however, offer a general description of his victim&#x27;s identity. Rouse claimed the man he killed had been: &quot;Forty years of age, between [and] . tall, respectably dressed in a light-coloured overcoat, with the [general] appearance of a clerk.&quot; The man also had &quot;a slight brogue&quot;, and had a boxing or sporting tattoo on his right forearm. Furthermore, he had been wearing police boots which Rouse claimed the man had informed him had been given to him by London police. The man also carried a sports diary.

In May 2012, the family of a 23-year-old man named William Briggs—missing since 1930—contacted Northamptonshire Police in the hope advances in DNA profiling may provide a positive identification; the family were redirected to a team of forensic scientists from the University of Leicester and Northumbria University who obtained archived tissue samples of the murdered man for comparison; the mitochondrial DNA samples did not prove to be a match.

To date, DNA testing has revealed nine families whose relatives disappeared around 1930 are not related to the victim of the &quot;Blazing Car Murder.&quot; Nonetheless, inquiries to establish the victim&#x27;s identity are ongoing.

==Media==

<text>Bellikon is a municipality in the district of Baden in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.
==History==
The area was settled during Roman times. The Roman road between Vindonissa (Windisch) and Turicum (Zürich) ran through here. In 1934, bricks were found which on examination proved to belong to a villa, which was excavated and documented in 1941, and afterwards covered up again with the help of interned Polish soldiers. Articles found on the site indicate a construction date at the end of the 1st century. In the middle of the 6th century, the Alamanni settled here and cleared the forest, destroying the Roman settlement.

Bellikon was first documented on October 11, 1064, in the foundation charter of Muri Abbey, though it was first individually mentioned in the 12th century as &quot;Pellikon&quot;. Bellikon and Hausen at first paid tithes to Murbach Abbey in Alsace, but was later part of the Habsburg territories. In 1415, the Aargau was conquered and thereafter Bellikon belonged to the village of Rohrdorf in the County of Baden. In 1798, Bellikon became part of the Canton of Baden in the Helvetic Republic. Bellikon was merged with Hausen in 1803 and became part of Aargau Canton.

At the beginning of the 20th century Bellikon was a farming village with a population of 377; fifty years later it reached 434. In the early 21st century, the number of inhabitants rose to over 1,400.

<text>Singapore Airlines Cargo (abbreviation: SIA Cargo) is the unit within Singapore Airlines (SIA) responsible for air cargo operations. It was incorporated in 1988. SIA Cargo manages the cargo operations of SIA&#x27;s fleet of freight- and passenger aircraft. Its main office is on the fifth floor of the SATS Airfreight Terminal 5 at Singapore Changi Airport.

SIA Cargo was formerly a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines and, for almost two decades, operated as a cargo airline with its own fleet of Boeing 747-400 freighters. In May 2017, Singapore Airlines announced that SIA Cargo would be re-integrated as a division within the SIA group; this was completed in the first half of 2018, after which SIA Cargo became the airline&#x27;s cargo division.

==History==
===Formation and expansion===
Singapore Airlines has been in the cargo business for over 50 years. They first started the cargo operations flying the Airspeed Consuls in 1947. In July 1992, Singapore Airlines created a cargo division to complement its passenger-carrying business. However, it was not until 1 July 2001 that &quot;Singapore Airlines Cargo&quot; was incorporated, taking over the air-freight operations of Singapore Airlines as a separate subsidiary. SIA Cargo leased the entire freighter fleet from Singapore Airlines, as well as taking over management of the cargo holds in all of Singapore Airlines&#x27; passenger aircraft. Within a few months, it entered an alliance with Lufthansa Cargo and SAS Cargo Group to form WOW Alliance on 1 October 2001.

SIA Cargo&#x27;s warehouse in Singapore, dubbed SIA Superhub 1, was opened in 1995. This warehouse is capable of handling up to 450,000 tons of goods a year. In 2001, the SIA Superhub 2 was opened, which increased the capacity to over 1,200,000 tonnes per year.

New routes were introduced in the next few years as the airline began to take advantage of liberalised aviation agreements. A round-the-world service was introduced on 31 October 2001, flying from Singapore to Hong Kong, Dallas, Chicago, Brussels, Sharjah, and back to Singapore on Wednesdays, and on the Singapore-Hong Kong-Dallas-Chicago-Brussels-Mumbai-Singapore route on Fridays. It became the first third-country cargo airline to fly direct between China and the United States on 22 May 2003, when flights commenced from Singapore to Xiamen, Nanjing and onwards to Chicago.

===Price fixing cases===
In December 2008, Singapore Airlines Cargo was alleged by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) to be a participant in a price fixing cartel in the air cargo industry. The ACCC accused Singapore Airlines Cargo of fixing the price of a fuel surcharge and a security surcharge that was applied to air cargo to and from Australia. Singapore Airlines Cargo was the third airline to be the targeted for fuel surcharge price fixing.

In May 2010, Singapore Airlines was fined by the Fair Trade Commission of South Korea for conspiring to introduce fuel surcharges for cargoes or continuing to raise them over the past seven years. Singapore Airlines Cargo released a statement saying that it was &quot;very disappointed&quot; and would &quot;study the decision closely with a serious view towards mounting an appeal&quot; once it received the commission&#x27;s full reasoning.

In November 2010, the European Commission fined Singapore Airlines Cargo 74.8 million euros for its involvement in a global cartel that included ten other carriers. The Commission found that the carriers—including SIA, Japan Airlines, Qantas, Air Canada, Air France-KLM and British Airways—had fixed fuel and security surcharges for more than six years. Singapore Airlines Cargo said it would likely appeal the ruling.

On 30 November 2010, Singapore Airlines Cargo pleaded guilty to a US$48 million fine imposed by the United States Department of Justice for its role in a conspiracy to fix cargo rates since February 2002, until at least 14 February 2006. Singapore Airlines Cargo&#x27;s price fixing was in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine for corporations of US$100 million.

In December 2013, Singapore Airlines Cargo agreed to settle over the issue of price fixing in the United States, without admitting to any wrongdoing or liability. Numerous airlines, including SIA Cargo, saw class actions taken against them in 2006 following investigations by various competition authorities on price fixing in air cargo services in the US. SIA Cargo decided to accept an amicable resolution to settle the class action with the payment of US$62.8 million.

===Recent history===
On 12 January 2017, Singapore Airlines Cargo was the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to be awarded the IATA CEIV Pharma Certification, a globally recognised pharmaceutical product handling accreditation.

In May 2017, parent Singapore Airlines announced it would dissolve Singapore Airlines Cargo as a separate company by mid-2018, with freight operations to be reintegrated as a unit within Singapore Airlines.

In 2017, Singapore Airlines Cargo renewed its partnership with Rolls-Royce to transport Trent 1000 aircraft engines from the latter&#x27;s Seletar Assembly and Test Unit in Singapore to Boeing 787 production facilities in the USA. SIA Cargo also provided charter services to carry state-of-the-art racing equipment for several global sporting events and to transport concert equipment for several high-profile artists.

==Destinations==

As of 31 March 2018, Singapore Airlines Cargo offered dedicated Boeing 747-400 freighter services to 19 cities in 13 countries and territories, including Singapore.

The freighters were transferred to Singapore Airlines as part of the reintegration; and Singapore Airlines Cargo now manages the cargo holds of these and all Singapore Airlines passenger aircraft. The company offers cargo product services to all destinations on the Singapore Airlines network.

===Codeshare agreements===
Singapore Airlines Cargo had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Nippon Cargo Airlines

==Fleet==


As of 5 August 2022, the Singapore Airlines Cargo fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
When incorporated in 2001, all nine of Singapore Airlines’ Boeing 747 freighters were transferred to the new cargo start-up at market value and henceforth, all new freighter purchases were to be made from the new company&#x27;s books.

Due to the Great Recession, in the late 2000s, there was a drop in global demand for freight. As a result, SIA Cargo stored some of its aircraft from January 2009 until February 2015 to reduce capacity. SIA Cargo also phased out its Boeing 747-400BCF ex-passenger aircraft converted to freighters.

<doc id="1002298" wikidata="Q749871" url="?curid=1002298" title="Aston Martin DB5">
<text>The Aston Martin DB5 is a British grand tourer (GT) produced by Aston Martin and designed by Italian coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera. Originally produced from 1963 to 1965, the DB5 was an evolution of the final series of DB4. The &quot;DB&quot; designation is from the initials of David Brown who built up the company from 1947 onwards.

The DB5 is best-known for its role in the &quot;James Bond&quot; films. It was first driven by the fictional spy in the film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964). In 2013, the car featured on a &quot;British Auto Legends&quot; postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

==Design==
The principal differences between the DB4 Series V and the DB5 are the all-aluminium engine, enlarged from 3.7 litres to 4.0 litres; a new ZF five-speed transmission which was more robust than the earlier David Brown unit (except for some of the first DB5s); and three SU carburettors. This engine, producing , which propelled the car to , was available in the Vantage (high powered) version of the DB4 from March 1962. It became the standard Aston Martin power unit with the launch in September 1963 of the DB5.

Standard equipment on the DB5 included reclining seats, wool pile carpets, electric windows, twin fuel tanks, chrome wire wheels, oil cooler, magnesium-alloy body built to Superleggera patent technique, full leather trim in the cabin and a fire extinguisher. All models had two doors and 2+2 seating configuration. The boot lids differed slightly between the DB4 mark 5 and the DB5.

Like the DB4, the DB5 had a live rear axle. At the beginning, the original four-speed manual gearbox (with optional overdrive) was standard fitment, but it was dropped in favour of the ZF five-speed box. A three-speed Borg-Warner DG automatic transmission was also available. The automatic option was changed to the Borg-Warner Model 8 shortly before the DB6 replaced the DB5.
==Specifications==

Standard coupé:
* Engine: inline-six
* Bore x stroke: 
* Fuel feed: 3 SU carburettors
* Power: at 5,500 rpm, Net
* Torque: at 3,850 rpm
* Weight: 
* Top speed: 
* 0– acceleration: 8 seconds.
==Variants==

===DB5 Vantage===

The high-performance DB5 Vantage was introduced in 1964. It featured three Weber carburettors and revised camshaft profiles. This engine produced at 5,500 rpm. 65 DB5 Vantage coupés were built.
===DB5 convertible===

123 convertible DB5s were produced (also with bodies by Touring), though they did not carry the &#x27;Volante&#x27; name until 1965. The convertible model was offered from 1963 to 1965. Originally only 19 of the 123 DB5 Convertibles made were left-hand drive. 12 cars were originally fitted with a factory Vantage engine, and at least one further convertible was subsequently factory-fitted with a DB6 specification Vantage engine. A rare factory option (fitted by Works Service prior to customer delivery) was a steel removable hard top.

From October 1965 to October 1966, Aston Martin used the last 37 of the Aston Martin DB5 chassis to make another convertible model. These 37 cars were known as &quot;Short Chassis&quot; Volantes and were the first Aston Martins to carry the &#x27;Volante&#x27; name. The &quot;short&quot; came from comparison with the subsequent DB6 which had a longer chassis, although when compared to the DB5 it was the same size. These cars differed from the DB5 convertible models in featuring DB6 split front and rear bumpers and Triumph TR4 rear lights, as also used on the DB6.

===DB5 shooting-brake===
A prototype DB5 shooting-brake was custom-built by the factory for David Brown, an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11 or 12 coupés were custom-modified for Aston Martin by independent coachbuilder Harold Radford. The tail lights used were Triumph units, and these were also adopted for the succeeding DB6. In August 2019 a DB5 Shooting Brake sold for a record $1.765m (£1.456m), making it the most valuable Shooting Brake-bodied car of any marque sold at auction.

==James Bond&#x27;s DB5==

The Aston Martin DB5 became widely known after special effects expert John Stears modified a DB5 for use by James Bond in the 1964 film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Author Ian Fleming had placed Bond in a DB Mark III in the novel, but Stears persuaded the company to make its DB5 prototype available.

There were a total of four &quot;Goldfinger&quot; DB5s. Two of these were used in filming and two were used only for promotional purposes. The first filming car, DP/2161/1, was fitted with gadgets. This DB5 was the original prototype and was painted Dubonnet Red. Before it appeared in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, it was used in episode 2.17, &quot;The Noble Sportsman,&quot; of &quot;The Saint&quot;. This car, chassis number DP/216/1, was later stripped of its weaponry and gadgetry by Aston Martin and resold. It was retrofitted by subsequent owners with non-original weaponry and later appeared in the film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), driven by Roger Moore. Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 was stolen in 1997 from its last owner in Florida and was reported to be still missing in 2021. The second filming car, DB5/1486/R, was used for driving scenes and had no gadgets. After filming, gadgets were added and the car was used for promotion. It featured the pop-out gun barrels behind the front indicators, the bullet shield behind the rear window and a three-way revolving front number plate showing &quot;LU 6789&quot; or &quot;4711-EA-62&quot; or &quot;BMT 216A.&quot; In 2010, RM Auctions sold this car for $4.6 million to Harry Yeaggy. The first publicity car, DB5/2017/R, was acquired by the Louwman Museum in The Hague. The second publicity car, DB5/2008/R, was auctioned by RM Sotheby&#x27;s in August 2019 for $6.4 million to an unknown buyer. These two cars were displayed at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair to promote the film. Sales of the DB5 increased after it was described as &quot;the most famous car in the world&quot;.

After &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the Aston Martin DB5 became closely associated with the James Bond franchise. The same car (registration BMT 216A) was used again in the next film, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, a year later. The DB5 is considered to be the quintessential vehicle associated with the Bond character and it has reappeared in subsequent Bond films. 
A different DB5 (registration BMT 214A) was used in the 1995 Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, in which the car was Bond&#x27;s personal vehicle and had no gadgets - although it did come equipped with a champagne cooler in the arm rest and a fax machine. Three different DB5s were used for filming. This same car briefly reappeared in the next film, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997). It was set to make a cameo appearance in the Scotland scenes in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999), but most of these scenes were cut in the final edit. Another DB5 (registration 56526) appeared in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), this time owned by the villain, Alex Dimitrios. This car had Bahamian number plates and left-hand drive (where the previous British versions had been right-hand drive). In the film, Bond wins the car from Dimitrios after beating him in a card game.

The &quot;Goldeneye&quot; DB5 was put on display at the London Film Museum in Covent Garden. Of the three cars used in the production, one car, DB5/2187/R, was filmed for the static ocean-side shot. A second car, DB5/1885/R, was driven in the chase scene against a Ferrari in Monte Carlo. This car was sold at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 2001 and entered the Guinness Book of Records that year after receiving the highest price paid for an item of Bond memorabilia. It appeared in the Bond exhibition at Beaulieu before moving to a new home in the London Film Museum. The third car, chassis number DB5/1484/R, was retained by the movie production company, Eon Productions, and appeared in later Bond movies.

Another silver-birch DB5 with the original registration BMT 216A was used in the 23rd James Bond film, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the release of the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, in 1962. The car is destroyed in the film&#x27;s climactic finale, although a highly detailed 1/3rd scale model was constructed for the destruction scenes. Two cars were used during filming: DB5/1484/R (first seen in GoldenEye) and a second car, DB5/2007/R. It is seen again in &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), firstly in Q&#x27;s underground workshop in various stages of rebuild, and at the film&#x27;s ending, fully rebuilt, with Bond driving it away.

In 2019, Aston Martin confirmed that the car would be featured in the next Bond film, &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, to be released in October 2021. The plan was to build replicas and not use existing vehicles. Eight replica DB5 stunt cars were built for the movie. The DB5 seen in a high-speed chase at the start of the film was sold for £2.92 million at a charity auction in London in 2022. 

===Remade===
In 2020, as the next phase of the Continuation programme which had started in 2017 with the reborn DB4GT, Aston Martin began construction of 25 new DB5 &quot;Goldfinger&quot;-themed cars at the factory in Newport Pagnell, north Buckinghamshire, where the first DB5s were built. The cars were authentic reproductions of Bond&#x27;s &quot;Goldfinger&quot; DB5 and were fitted with most of the spy gadgets seen in the film. Several of the gadgets were designed to be functional, including smoke screen, simulated oil slick delivery system, revolving number plates, and rear bullet shield. 

Wherever possible, Aston Martin used the same manufacturers as were used in the original 1963-65 production run. ZF Friedrichshafen, for example, supplied the transmission and Connolly Leather supplied the interiors. As in the 1960s, the aluminium body panels were hand-made and fitted by hand to a steel chassis. The engine was a 290bhp 4.0 litre inline six-cylinder with three SU carburettors, mated to a five-speed ZF manual transmission, and the cars were finished in the same Silver Birch colour scheme as the original. The &quot;Goldfinger&quot; DB5s were created in association with the producers of the James Bond films, EON Productions. It was intended that they would sell for about each. The first of the new cars rolled off the production line at the beginning of July 2020.

===Promotional items===

With &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Corgi Toys began its decades-long relationship with the Bond franchise. They produced a model of the car which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. A detailed 1:24 scale plastic kit of the James Bond DB5 was produced by Airfix between 1966 and 1970.

A highly detailed, 1:24 scale die-cast DB5 model with many working features was produced by the Danbury Mint in 2006 as a limited edition for &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. In January 2011, a 1/8 scale model was released by part work magazine publisher GE Fabbri in the UK. Over 85 weekly parts, the model built into one of the biggest 007 scale models, with working gadgets and lights. In 2015, Hot Wheels Elite released their Cult Classics Goldfinger Aston Martin DB5 in 1/18 and 1/43 scale, the 1/18 model featuring many of the gadgets from the original film.

In July 2018, LEGO unveiled a 1:8 scale 1,290-piece DB5 construction set with front machine guns, hidden telephone, ejector seat, bullet shield, tyre shredders and the homing screen in the cockpit. In June 2022, The Lego Group announced that a construction set of James Bond&#x27;s Aston Martin DB5 would be released in August 2022 as part of the Lego Speed Champions range.

===Two-thirds scale replicas===

The Little Car Company in Bicester, UK, in partnership with Aston Martin Lagonda, created &#x27;Junior Edition&#x27;, two-thirds scale, electric-powered replicas of the DB5 convertible, the DB5 Vantage and the &quot;No Time to Die&quot; DB5, which were priced between £35,000 and £90,000. The cars were built using 3D scans of the original.

<doc id="1002300" wikidata="Q4830558" url="?curid=1002300" title="Axiom of determinacy">
<text>In mathematics, the axiom of determinacy (abbreviated as AD) is a possible axiom for set theory introduced by Jan Mycielski and Hugo Steinhaus in 1962. It refers to certain two-person topological games of length ω. AD states that every game of a certain type is determined; that is, one of the two players has a winning strategy.

Steinhaus and Mycielski&#x27;s motivation for AD was its interesting consequences, and suggested that AD could be true in the smallest natural model L(R) of a set theory, which accepts only a weak form of the axiom of choice (AC) but contains all real and all ordinal numbers. Some consequences of AD followed from theorems proved earlier by Stefan Banach and Stanisław Mazur, and Morton Davis. Mycielski and Stanisław Świerczkowski contributed another one: AD implies that all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable. Later Donald A. Martin and others proved more important consequences, especially in descriptive set theory. In 1988, John R. Steel and W. Hugh Woodin concluded a long line of research. Assuming the existence of some uncountable cardinal numbers analogous to ℵ0, they proved the original conjecture of Mycielski and Steinhaus that AD is true in L(R).

==Types of game that are determined==
The axiom of determinacy refers to games of the following specific form:
Consider a subset &quot;A&quot; of the Baire space ωω of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Two players alternately pick natural numbers
:&quot;n&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;1, &quot;n&quot;2, &quot;n&quot;3, ...
That generates the sequence ⟨&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;⟩&quot;i&quot;∈ω after infinitely many moves. The player who picks first wins the game if and only if the sequence generated is an element of &quot;A&quot;. The axiom of determinacy is the statement that all such games are determined.

Not all games require the axiom of determinacy to prove them determined. If the set &quot;A&quot; is clopen, the game is essentially a finite game, and is therefore determined. Similarly, if &quot;A&quot; is a closed set, then the game is determined. By the Borel determinacy theorem, games whose winning set is a Borel set are determined. It follows from the existence of sufficiently large cardinals that AD holds in L(R) and that a game is determined if it has a projective set as its winning set (see Projective determinacy).

The axiom of determinacy implies that for every subspace &quot;X&quot; of the real numbers, the Banach–Mazur game BM(&quot;X&quot;) is determined, and consequently, that every set of reals has the property of Baire.

== Incompatibility with the axiom of choice ==
Under assumption of the axiom of choice, we present two separate constructions of counterexamples to the axiom of determinacy. It follows that the axiom of determinacy and the axiom of choice are incompatible.

=== Using a well-ordering of the continuum ===
The set &quot;S&quot;1 of all first player strategies in an ω-game &quot;G&quot; has the same cardinality as the continuum. The same is true for the set &quot;S&quot;2 of all second player strategies. Let &quot;SG&quot; be the set of all possible sequences in &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; be the subset of sequences of &quot;SG&quot; that make the first player win. With the axiom of choice we can well order the continuum, and we can do so in such a way that any proper initial portion has lower cardinality than the continuum. We use the obtained well ordered set &quot;J&quot; to index both &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2, and construct &quot;A&quot; such that it will be a counterexample.

We start with empty sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Let &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot; be the index of the strategies in &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2. We need to consider all strategies &quot;S&quot;1 = {s1(&quot;α&quot;)}&quot;α&quot;∈&quot;J&quot; of the first player and all strategies &quot;S&quot;2 = {s2(&quot;α&quot;)}&quot;α&quot;∈&quot;J&quot; of the second player to make sure that for every strategy there is a strategy of the other player that wins against it. For every strategy of the player considered we will generate a sequence that gives the other player a win. Let &quot;t&quot; be the time whose axis has length ℵ0 and which is used during each game sequence. We create the counterexample &quot;A&quot; by transfinite recursion on &quot;α&quot;:

# Consider the strategy s1(&quot;α&quot;) of the first player.
# Apply this strategy on an ω-game, generating (together with the first player&#x27;s strategy s1(&quot;α&quot;)) a sequence ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, &quot;b&quot;4, ...,a&quot;t&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;t&quot;+1, ...⟩, which does not belong to &quot;A&quot;. This is possible, because the number of choices for ⟨&quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;4, &quot;b&quot;6, ...⟩ has the same cardinality as the continuum, which is larger than the cardinality of the proper initial portion { &quot;β&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot; | &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot; } of &quot;J.&quot;
# Add this sequence to &quot;B&quot; to indicate that s1(&quot;α&quot;) loses (on ⟨&quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;4, &quot;b&quot;6, ...⟩). 
# Consider the strategy s2(&quot;α&quot;) of the second player.
# Apply this strategy on an ω-game, generating (together with the second player&#x27;s strategy &quot;s&quot;2(&quot;α&quot;)) a sequence ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, &quot;b&quot;4, ..., a&quot;t&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;t&quot;+1, ...⟩, which does not belong to &quot;B.&quot; This is possible, because the number of choices for ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;3, &quot;a&quot;5, ...⟩ has the same cardinality as the continuum, which is larger than the cardinality of the proper initial portion { &quot;β&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot; | &quot;β&quot; ≤ &quot;α&quot; } of &quot;J.&quot;
# Add this sequence to &quot;A&quot; to indicate that &quot;s&quot;2(&quot;α&quot;) loses (on ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;3, &quot;a&quot;5, ...⟩).
# Process all possible strategies of &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2 with transfinite induction on &quot;α.&quot; For all sequences that are not in &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; after that, decide arbitrarily whether they belong to &quot;A&quot; or to &quot;B,&quot; so that &quot;B&quot; is the complement of &quot;A.&quot;

Once this has been done, prepare for an ω-game &quot;G&quot;. For a given strategy &quot;s&quot;1 of the first player, there is an &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot; such that &quot;s&quot;1 = &quot;s&quot;1(&quot;α&quot;), and &quot;A&quot; has been constructed such that &quot;s&quot;1(&quot;α&quot;) fails (on certain choices ⟨&quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;4, &quot;b&quot;6, ...⟩ of the second player). Hence, &quot;s&quot;1 fails. Similarly, any other strategy of either player also fails.

=== Using a choice function ===
In this construction, the use of the axiom of choice is similar to the choice of socks as stated in the quote by Bertrand Russell at Axiom of choice#Quotations.

In a ω-game, the two players are generating the sequence ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, &quot;b&quot;4, ...⟩, an element in ωω, where our convention is that 0 is not a natural number, hence neither player can choose it. Define the function &quot;f&quot;: ωω → {0, 1}ω such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the unique sequence of length ω with values are in {0, 1} whose first term equals 0, and whose sequence of runs (see run-length encoding) equals &quot;r.&quot; (Such an &quot;f&quot; can be shown to be injective. The image is the subset of {0, 1}ω of sequences that start with 0 and that are not eventually constant. Formally, &quot;f&quot; is the Minkowski question mark function, {0, 1}ω is the Cantor space and ωω is the Baire space.) 

Observe the equivalence relation on {0, 1}ω such that two sequences are equivalent if and only if they differ in a finite number of terms. This partitions the set into equivalence classes. Let &quot;T&quot; be the set of equivalence classes (such that &quot;T&quot; has the cardinality of the continuum). Define &quot;g&quot;: {0, 1}ω → &quot;T&quot; that takes a sequence to its equivalence class. Define the complement of any sequence &quot;s&quot; in {0, 1}ω to be the sequence s1 that differs in each term. Define the function &quot;h&quot;: &quot;T&quot; → &quot;T&quot; such that for any sequence &quot;s&quot; in {0, 1}ω, &quot;h&quot; applied to the equivalence class of &quot;s&quot; equals the equivalence class of the complement of &quot;s&quot; (which is well-defined because if &quot;s&quot; and &quot;s&quot;&#x27; are equivalent, then their complements are equivalent). One can show that &quot;h&quot; is an involution with no fixed points, and thus we have a partition of &quot;T&quot; into size-2 subsets such that each subset is of the form {&quot;t&quot;, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)}. Using the axiom of choice, we can choose one element out of each subset. In other words, we are choosing &quot;half&quot; of the elements of &quot;T,&quot; a subset that we denote by &quot;U&quot; (where U ⊆ T) such that &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; iff &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) ∉ &quot;U.&quot;

Next, we define the subset &quot;A&quot; ⊆ ωω in which 1 wins: &quot;A&quot; is the set of all &quot;r&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)) ∈ &quot;U.&quot; We now claim that neither player has a winning strategy, using a strategy-stealing argument. Denote the current game state by a finite sequence of natural numbers (so that if the length of this sequence is even, then 1 is next to play; otherwise 2 is next to play).

Suppose that &quot;q&quot; is a (deterministic) winning strategy for 2. Player 1 can construct a strategy &quot;p&quot; that beats &quot;q&quot; as follows: Suppose that player 2 response (according to &quot;q&quot;) to ⟨1⟩ is &quot;b&quot;1. Then 1 specifies in &quot;p&quot; that &quot;a&quot;1 = 1 + &quot;b&quot;1. (Roughly, 1 is now playing as 2 in a second parallel game; 1 winning set in the second game equals 2 winning set in the original game, and this is a contradiction. Nevertheless, we continue more formally.)

Suppose that 2 response (always according to &quot;q&quot;) to ⟨1 + &quot;b&quot;1⟩ is &quot;b&quot;2, and 2 response to ⟨1, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2⟩ is &quot;b&quot;3. We construct &quot;p&quot; for 1, we only aim to beat &quot;q,&quot; and therefore only have to handle the response &quot;b&quot;2 to 1 first move. Therefore set 1 response to ⟨1 + &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2⟩ is &quot;b&quot;3. In general, for even &quot;n,&quot; denote 2 response to ⟨1 + b1, ..., b&quot;n&quot;−1⟩ by &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; and 2 response to ⟨1, &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;⟩ by &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1. Then 1 specify in &quot;p&quot; that 1 response to ⟨1 + &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;⟩ is &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1. Strategy &quot;q&quot; is presumed to be winning, and game-result &quot;r&quot; in ωω given by ⟨1, &quot;b&quot;1, ...⟩ is one possible sequence allowed by &quot;q,&quot; so &quot;r&quot; must be winning for 2 and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)) must not be in &quot;U.&quot; The game result &quot;r&quot;&#x27; in ωω given by ⟨1 + &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, ...⟩ is also a sequence allowed by &quot;q&quot; (specifically, &quot;q&quot; playing against &quot;p&quot;), so &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;)) must not be in &quot;U.&quot; However, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;) differ in all but the first term (by the nature of run-length encoding and an offset of 1), so &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;) are in complement equivalent classes, so &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;)) cannot both be in &quot;U,&quot; contradicting the assumption that &quot;q&quot; is a winning strategy.

Similarly, suppose that &quot;p&quot; is a winning strategy for 1; the argument is similar but now uses the fact that equivalence classes were defined by allowing an arbitrarily large finite number of terms to differ. Let &quot;a&quot;1 be 1 first move. In general, for even &quot;n,&quot; denote 1 response to ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, 1⟩ (if &quot;n&quot; = 2) or ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, 1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;n−1⟩ by &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; and 1 response to ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, 1 + &quot;a&quot;2, ... &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;⟩ by &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1. Then the game result &quot;r&quot; given by ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, 1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ...⟩ is allowed by &quot;p&quot; so that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)) must be in &quot;U&quot;; also the game result &quot;r&quot;&#x27; given by ⟨&quot;a&quot;1, 1 + &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ...⟩ is also allowed by &quot;p&quot; so that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;)) must be in &quot;U.&quot; However, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;) differ in all but the first &quot;a&quot;1 + 1 terms, so they are in complement equivalent classes, therefore &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)) and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&#x27;)) cannot both be in &quot;U,&quot; contradicting that &quot;p&quot; is a winning strategy.

== Large cardinals and the axiom of determinacy ==
The consistency of the axiom of determinacy is closely related to the question of the consistency of large cardinal axioms. By a theorem of Woodin, the consistency of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without choice (ZF) together with the axiom of determinacy is equivalent to the consistency of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with choice (ZFC) together with the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals. Since Woodin cardinals are strongly inaccessible, if AD is consistent, then so are an infinity of inaccessible cardinals.

Moreover, if to the hypothesis of an infinite set of Woodin cardinals is added the existence of a measurable cardinal larger than all of them, a very strong theory of Lebesgue measurable sets of reals emerges, as it is then provable that the axiom of determinacy is true in L(R), and therefore that &quot;every&quot; set of real numbers in L(R) is determined.

== Projective ordinals ==
Yiannis Moschovakis introduced the ordinals δ, which is the upper bound of the length of Δ-norms (injections of a Δ set into the ordinals), where Δ is a level of the projective hierarchy. Assuming AD, all δ are initial ordinals, and we have , and for &quot;n&quot; &lt; ω, the Suslin cardinal is equal to δ.

<text>Kyle Ivan Secor (born May 31, 1957) is an American television and film actor. He is known for portraying Detective Tim Bayliss on the crime drama series &quot;&quot; (1993–1999).

==Early years==
Secor was born in Tacoma, Washington as the youngest boy in a family of three boys. He grew up in nearby Federal Way and graduated from Federal Way High School in 1975. His father worked in sales. As a boy, he wanted to be a professional basketball player, and at 6&#x27;4&quot; had the height and build, but his dreams of going pro or becoming a professional were hindered as he suffered extreme near-sightedness, so he was forced to look elsewhere for a career. 

==Career==

After attending a community college, Secor moved to Los Angeles. There, he performed in plays such as &quot;And a Nightingale Sang&quot; at the Santa Monica Playhouse (1986), &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; (1986) and &quot;In the Jungle of Cities&quot; (1987) at the Pasadena Playhouse. 

Secor&#x27;s first major television role was the character Brian Bradford on the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, soon followed by a stint on the hospital drama &quot;St. Elsewhere,&quot; in which he played Brett Johnston, a patient dying of AIDS.

After working in several movies, including &quot;Heart of Dixie&quot; (1989), &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991), &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; (1991), &quot;Delusion&quot; (1991), and &quot;Untamed Heart&quot; (1993), in 1993 Secor was cast as Detective Tim Bayliss in &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot;, a role which he would fill for the entirety of the series. Throughout most of this time, Secor was paired on screen with actor Andre Braugher, who played his partner Frank Pembleton. Though the show was an ensemble work, Secor&#x27;s character was placed in a particularly pivotal role, as the series began on his first day of work in the Baltimore homicide unit, and ended with his resignation in the series finale. Bayliss&#x27; character was conflicted through much of the show&#x27;s run, obsessed with the murder of a child he and Pembleton could not solve. The character also had issues involving social protest, past molestation by an uncle and questions about his own sexuality.

After a successful seven-year run on &quot;Homicide&quot;, Secor went on to a short-lived role on &quot;Party of Five&quot; and made two feature films, &quot;Endsville&quot; and &quot;Beat&quot;. He returned to the small screen as a doctor in the CBS production, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, for nine weeks during the fall of 2000. He appeared in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Mistake&quot;, which was shown on ABC on March 18, 2001. He appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; in the fall of 2001 and had a recurring supporting role in the cancelled ABC production of Steven Bochco&#x27;s &quot;Philly&quot; from September 2001 through May 2002. In fall 2002 he was seen as a guest star on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Without a Trace&quot;. Spring of 2004 brought Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Infidelity&quot; opposite former &quot;Philly&quot; costar Kim Delaney, and the long-awaited Disney-ABC television film &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; featuring him in the role of the Man with Red Eyes. He had a recurring role as Jake Kane in the 2004–2005 freshman season of the show &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and guest-starred in the series finale.

From 2005 to 2006, he starred with Geena Davis in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, playing Rod Calloway, the husband and &#x27;first gentleman&#x27; of President Mackenzie Allen, the first female President. In 2007, he played Alan &#x27;Skip&#x27; Matthews in the short-lived show &quot;Hidden Palms&quot;.

Secor had a recurring role as Hanson North, a defense attorney who has a romantic history with Laura Harris&#x27; character in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Murder Club&quot;, 2007 – 2008.

He also acted in &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as Dr. Robert L. Brooks, who was married to Phoebe Prentice, a former flame of Alan Shore. Also, he guest starred in &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; as Doug Bancroft. In August 2010 he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Closer&quot; as an airline pilot involved in drug smuggling. Secor appeared on the revival of the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; on the fifth episode of their first season, &quot;Nalowale&quot;, playing Ambassador Michael Reeves. In 2016, he portrayed presidential candidate Minister Edwidge Owens running opposite Senator Charlene &quot;Charlie&quot; Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) in &quot;The Purge: Election Year&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Thomas Snow/Icicle on the 2018-19 fifth season of &quot;The Flash&quot;.

In 2021, Secor published a semi-autobiographical book titled &quot;DEATH of the ACTOR: Everything I Never Learned About Nothing&quot; where he explores the concept of nonduality as it pertains to acting.

==Personal life==
Secor married actress Kari Coleman on January 28, 2002. They have two children.

<text>In computer engineering, out-of-order execution (or more formally dynamic execution) is a paradigm used in high-performance central processing units to make use of instruction cycles that would otherwise be wasted. In this paradigm, a processor executes instructions in an order governed by the availability of input data and execution units, rather than by their original order in a program. In doing so, the processor can avoid being idle while waiting for the preceding instruction to complete and can, in the meantime, process the next instructions that are able to run immediately and independently.

== History ==
Out-of-order execution is a restricted form of dataflow architecture, which was a major research area in computer architecture in the 1970s and early 1980s.

=== Early use in supercomputers ===
The first machine to use out-of-order execution was the CDC 6600 (1964), designed by James E. Thornton, which uses a scoreboard to avoid conflicts. It permits an instruction to execute if its source operand (read) registers aren&#x27;t to be written to by any unexecuted earlier instruction (true dependency) and the destination (write) register not be a register used by any unexecuted earlier instruction (false dependency). The 6600 lacks the means to avoid stalling an execution unit on false dependencies (write after write (WAW) and write after read (WAR) conflicts, respectively termed &quot;first-order conflict&quot; and &quot;third-order conflict&quot; by Thornton, who termed true dependencies (read after write (RAW)) as second-order conflict) because each address has only a single location referable by it. The WAW is worse than WAR for the 6600, because when an execution unit encounters a WAR, the other execution units still receive and execute instructions, but upon a WAW the assignment of instructions to execution units stops, and they can not receive any further instructions until the WAW-causing instruction&#x27;s destination register has been written to by earlier instruction.

About two years later, the IBM System/360 Model 91 (1966) introduced register renaming with Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm, which dissolves false dependencies (WAW and WAR), making full out-of-order execution possible. An instruction addressing a write into a register &quot;rn&quot; can be executed before an earlier instruction using the register &quot;rn&quot; is executed, by actually writing into an alternative (renamed) register &quot;alt-rn&quot;, which is turned into a normal register &quot;rn&quot; only when all the earlier instructions addressing &quot;rn&quot; have been executed, but until then &quot;rn&quot; is given for earlier instructions and &quot;alt-rn&quot; for later ones addressing &quot;rn&quot;. 

In the Model 91 the register renaming is implemented by a bypass termed &quot;Common Data Bus&quot; (CDB) and memory source operand buffers, leaving the physical architectural registers unused for many cycles as the oldest state of registers addressed by any unexecuted instruction is found on the CDB. Another advantage the Model 91 has over the 6600 is the ability to execute instructions out-of-order in the same execution unit, not just between the units like the 6600. This is accomplished by reservation stations, from which instructions go to the execution unit when ready, as opposed to the FIFO queue of each execution unit of the 6600. The Model 91 is also capable of reordering loads and stores to execute before the preceding loads and stores, unlike the 6600, which only has a limited ability to move loads past loads, and stores past stores, but not loads past stores and stores past loads. Only the floating-point registers of the Model 91 are renamed, making it subject to the same WAW and WAR limitations as the CDC 6600 when running fixed-point calculations. The 91 and 6600 both also suffer from imprecise exceptions, which needed to be solved before out-of-order execution could be applied generally and made practical outside supercomputers.

=== Precise exceptions ===
To have precise exceptions, the proper in-order state of the program&#x27;s execution must be available upon an exception. By 1985 various approaches were developed as described by James E. Smith and Andrew R. Pleszkun. The CDC Cyber 205 was a precursor, as upon a virtual memory interrupt the entire state of the processor (including the information on the partially executed instructions) is saved into an &quot;invisible exchange package&quot;, so that it can resume at the same state of execution. However to make all exceptions precise, there has to be a way to cancel the effects of instructions. The CDC Cyber 990 (1984) implements precise interrupts by using a history buffer, which holds the old (overwritten) values of registers that are restored when an exception necessitates the reverting of instructions. Through simulation, Smith determined that adding a reorder buffer (or history buffer or equivalent) to the Cray-1S would reduce the performance of executing the first 14 Livermore loops (unvectorized) by only 3%. Important academic research in this subject was led by Yale Patt with his HPSm simulator.

In the 1980s many early RISC microprocessors, like the Motorola 88100, had out-of-order writeback to the registers, resulting in imprecise exceptions. Instructions started execution in order, but some (e.g. floating-point) took more cycles to complete execution. However, the single-cycle execution of the most basic instructions greatly reduced the scope of the problem compared to the CDC 6600.

=== Decoupling ===
Smith also researched how to make different execution units operate more independently of each other and of the memory, front-end, and branching. He implemented those ideas in the Astronautics ZS-1 (1988), featuring a decoupling of the integer/load/store pipeline from the floating-point pipeline, allowing inter-pipeline reordering. The ZS-1 was also capable of executing loads ahead of preceding stores. In his 1984 paper, he opined that enforcing the precise exceptions only on the integer/memory pipeline should be sufficient for many use cases, as it even permits virtual memory. Each pipeline had an instruction buffer to decouple it from the instruction decoder, to prevent the stalling of the front end. To further decouple the memory access from execution, each of the two pipelines was associated with two addressable queues that effectively performed limited register renaming. A similar decoupled architecture had been used a bit earlier in the Culler 7. The ZS-1&#x27;s ISA, like IBM&#x27;s subsequent POWER, aided the early execution of branches.

=== Research comes to fruition ===
With the POWER1 (1990), IBM returned to out-of-order execution. It was the first processor to combine register renaming (though again only floating-point registers) with precise exceptions. It uses a &quot;physical register file&quot; (i.e. a dynamically remapped file with both uncommitted and committed values) instead of a reorder buffer, but the ability to cancel instructions is needed only in the branch unit, which implements a history buffer (named &quot;program counter stack&quot; by IBM) to undo changes to count, link, and condition registers. The reordering capability of even the floating-point instructions is still very limited; due to POWER1&#x27;s inability to reorder floating-point arithmetic instructions (results became available in-order), their destination registers aren&#x27;t renamed. POWER1 also doesn&#x27;t have reservation stations needed for out-of-order use of the same execution unit. The next year IBM&#x27;s ES/9000 model 900 had register renaming added for the general-purpose registers. It also has reservation stations with six entries for the dual integer unit (each cycle, from the six instructions up to two can be selected and then executed) and six entries for the FPU. Other units have simple FIFO queues. The reordering distance is up to 32 instructions. The A19 of Unisys&#x27; A-series of mainframes was also released in 1991 and was claimed to have out-of-order execution, and one analyst called the A19&#x27;s technology three to five years ahead of the competition.

=== Wide adoption ===
The first superscalar single-chip processors (Intel i960CA in 1989) used a simple scoreboarding scheduling like the CDC 6600 had a quarter of a century earlier. In 1992–1996 a rapid advancement of techniques, enabled by increasing transistor counts, saw proliferation down to personal computers. The Motorola 88110 (1992) used a history buffer to revert instructions. Loads could be executed ahead of preceding stores. While stores and branches were waiting to start execution, subsequent instructions of other types could keep flowing through all the pipeline stages, including writeback. The 12-entry capacity of the history buffer placed a limit on the reorder distance. The PowerPC 601 (1993) was an evolution of the RISC Single Chip, itself a simplification of POWER1. The 601 permitted branch and floating-point instructions to overtake the integer instructions already in the fetched instruction queue, the lowest four entries of which were scanned for dispatchability. In the case of a cache miss, loads and stores could be reordered. Only the link and count registers could be renamed. In the fall of 1994 NexGen and IBM with Motorola brought the renaming of general-purpose registers to single-chip CPUs. NexGen&#x27;s Nx586 was the first x86 processor capable of out-of-order execution and featured a reordering distance of up to 14 micro-operations. The PowerPC 603 renamed both the general-purpose and FP registers. Each of the four non-branch execution units can have one instruction wait in front of it without blocking the instruction flow to the other units. A five-entry reorder buffer lets no more than four instructions overtake an unexecuted instruction. Due to a store buffer, a load can access cache ahead of a preceding store.

PowerPC 604 (1995) was the first single-chip processor with execution unit-level reordering, as three out of its six units each had a two-entry reservation station permitting the newer entry to execute before the older. The reorder buffer capacity is 16 instructions. A four-entry load queue and a six-entry store queue track the reordering of loads and stores upon cache misses. HAL SPARC64 (1995) exceeded the reordering capacity of the ES/9000 model 900 by having three 8-entry reservation stations for integer, floating-point, and address generation unit, and a 12-entry reservation station for load/store, which permits greater reordering of cache/memory access than preceding processors. Up to 64 instructions can be in a reordered state at a time. Pentium Pro (1995) introduced a &quot;unified reservation station&quot;, which at the 20 micro-OP capacity permitted very flexible reordering, backed by a 40-entry reorder buffer. Loads can be reordered ahead of both loads and stores.

The practically attainable per-cycle rate of execution rose further as full out-of-order execution was further adopted by SGI/MIPS (R10000) and HP PA-RISC (PA-8000) in 1996. The same year Cyrix 6x86 and AMD K5 brought advanced reordering techniques into mainstream personal computers. Since DEC Alpha gained out-of-order execution in 1998 (Alpha 21264), the top-performing out-of-order processor cores have been unmatched by in-order cores other than HP/Intel Itanium 2 and IBM POWER6, though the latter had an out-of-order floating-point unit. The other high-end in-order processors fell far behind, namely Sun&#x27;s UltraSPARC III/IV, and IBM&#x27;s mainframes which had lost the out-of-order execution capability for the second time, remaining in-order into the z10 generation. Later big in-order processors were focused on multithreaded performance, but eventually the SPARC T series and Xeon Phi changed to out-of-order execution in 2011 and 2016 respectively.

Almost all processors for phones and other lower-end applications remained in-order until . First, Qualcomm&#x27;s Scorpion (reordering distance of 32) shipped in Snapdragon, and a bit later Arm&#x27;s A9 succeeded A8. For low-end x86 personal computers in-order Bonnell microarchitecture in early Intel Atom processors were first challenged by AMD&#x27;s Bobcat microarchitecture, and in 2013 were succeeded by an out-of-order Silvermont microarchitecture. Because the complexity of out-of-order execution precludes achieving the lowest minimum power consumption, cost and size, in-order execution is still prevalent in microcontrollers and embedded systems, as well as in phone-class cores such as Arm&#x27;s A55 and A510 in big.LITTLE configurations.

== Basic concept ==
=== Background ===
Out-of-order execution is more sophisticated relative to the baseline of in-order execution. In pipelined in-order execution processors, execution of instructions overlap in pipelined fashion with each requiring multiple clock cycles to complete. The consequence is that results from a previous instruction will lag behind where they may be needed in the next. In-order execution still has to keep track of these dependencies. Its approach is however quite unsophisticated: stall, every time. Out-of-order uses much more sophisticated data tracking techniques, as described below.

=== In-order processors ===
In earlier processors, the processing of instructions is performed in an instruction cycle normally consisting of the following steps:
# Instruction fetch.
# If input operands are available (in processor registers, for instance), the instruction is dispatched to the appropriate functional unit. If one or more operands are unavailable during the current clock cycle (generally because they must be fetched from memory), the processor stalls until they are available.
# The instruction is executed by the appropriate functional unit.
# The functional unit writes the results back to the register file.

Often, an in-order processor has a bit vector recording which registers will be written to by a pipeline. If any input operands have the corresponding bit set in this vector, the instruction stalls. Essentially, the vector performs a greatly simplified role of protecting against register hazards. Thus out-of-order execution uses 2D matrices whereas in-order execution uses a 1D vector for hazard avoidance.

=== Out-of-order processors ===
This new paradigm breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps:
# Instruction fetch.
# Instruction decoding.
# Instruction renaming.
# Instruction dispatch to an instruction queue (also called instruction buffer or reservation stations).
# The instruction waits in the queue until its input operands are available. The instruction can leave the queue before older instructions.
# The instruction is issued to the appropriate functional unit and executed by that unit.
# The results are queued.
# Only after all older instructions have their results written back to the register file, then this result is written back to the register file. This is called the graduation or retire stage.

The key concept of out-of-order processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of stalls that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable. In the outline above, the processor avoids the stall that occurs in step 2 of the in-order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data.

Out-of-order processors fill these &quot;slots&quot; in time with other instructions that &quot;are&quot; ready, then reorder the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal. The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as &quot;program order&quot;, in the processor they are handled in &quot;data order&quot;, the order in which the data becomes available in the processor&#x27;s registers. Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output.

The benefit of out-of-order processing grows as the instruction pipeline deepens and the speed difference between main memory (or cache memory) and the processor widens. On modern machines, the processor runs many times faster than the memory, so during the time an in-order processor spends waiting for data to arrive, it could have theoretically processed a large number of instructions.

== Dispatch and issue decoupling allows out-of-order issue ==
One of the differences created by the new paradigm is the creation of queues that allow the dispatch step to be decoupled from the issue step and the graduation stage to be decoupled from the execute stage. An early name for the paradigm was &quot;decoupled architecture&quot;. In the earlier &quot;in-order&quot; processors, these stages operated in a fairly lock-step, pipelined fashion.

The fetch and decode stages is separated from the execute stage in a pipelined processor by using a buffer. The buffer&#x27;s purpose is to partition the memory access and execute functions in a computer program and achieve high performance by exploiting the fine-grain parallelism between the two. In doing so, it effectively hides all memory latency from the processor&#x27;s perspective.

A larger buffer can, in theory, increase throughput. However, if the processor has a branch misprediction then the entire buffer may need to be flushed, wasting a lot of clock cycles and reducing the effectiveness. Furthermore, larger buffers create more heat and use more die space. For this reason processor designers today favor a multi-threaded design approach.

Decoupled architectures are generally thought of as not useful for general-purpose computing as they do not handle control-intensive code well. Control intensive code include such things as nested branches that occur frequently in operating system kernels. Decoupled architectures play an important role in scheduling in very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures.

== Execute and writeback decoupling allows program restart ==
The queue for results is necessary to resolve issues such as branch mispredictions and exceptions. The results queue allows programs to be restarted after an exception and for the instructions to be completed in program order. The queue allows results to be discarded due to mispredictions on older branch instructions and exceptions taken on older instructions. The ability to issue instructions past branches that have yet to be resolved is known as speculative execution.

== Micro-architectural choices ==
* Are the instructions dispatched to a centralized queue or to multiple distributed queues?

:IBM PowerPC processors use queues that are distributed among the different functional units while other out-of-order processors use a centralized queue. IBM uses the term &quot;reservation stations&quot; for their distributed queues.

* Is there an actual results queue or are the results written directly into a register file? For the latter, the queueing function is handled by register maps that hold the register renaming information for each instruction in flight.

:Early Intel out-of-order processors use a results queue called a reorder buffer, while most later out-of-order processors use register maps.

:More precisely: Intel P6 family microprocessors have both a reorder buffer (ROB) and a register alias table (RAT). The ROB was motivated mainly by branch misprediction recovery.

:The Intel P6 family is among the earliest OoOE microprocessors but were supplanted by the NetBurst architecture. Years later, NetBurst proved to be a dead end due to its long pipeline that assumed the possibility of much higher operating frequencies. Materials were not able to match the design&#x27;s ambitious clock targets due to thermal issues and later designs based on NetBurst, namely Tejas and Jayhawk, were cancelled. Intel reverted to the P6 design as the basis of the Core and Nehalem microarchitectures. The succeeding Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell microarchitectures are a departure from the reordering techniques used in P6 and employ reordering techniques from the EV6 and the P4 but with a somewhat shorter pipeline.

<text>The Gilgit Agency () was an agency within the British Indian Empire. It encompassed the subsidiary states of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir situated along the northern border. The primary objective of establishing the Gilgit Agency was to bolster and fortify these regions, particularly in the context of concerns about Russian encroachment in the area. The subsidiary states encompassed Hunza, Nagar and other states in the present day districts of Gupis-Yasin, Ghizer, Darel, Tangir and Diamer. The agency headquarters was based in the town of Gilgit, within the Gilgit tehsil of Jammu and Kashmir.

The administered area was bounded in the west by the Chitral State, in the northwest by Afghanistan&#x27;s Wakhan corridor, in the east by Chinese Turkestan, in the south by the Kashmir province, and in the southeast by the Ladakh &quot;wazarat&quot; of Jammu and Kashmir (which included Baltistan).

An Officer on Special Duty was established in 1877 in the town of Gilgit, upgraded to a permanent Political Agent in 1889. In 1935, the Gilgit tehsil of the princely state was leased from the Maharaja, which also came under the administration of the Political Agent. The Astore tehsil continued to be under the Maharaja&#x27;s administration. In July 1947, shortly before the partition of India, the Gilgit Leased Area and the Agency were returned to the Maharaja. However, the Gilgit Scouts rebelled on 1 November 1947 after the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India, and Pakistan took over the administration of the areas soon thereafter.

Under the Pakistani administration, the Gilgit, Astore, and Skardu (Baltistan) tehsils, as well as the subsidiary states previously under the agency, were clubbed together under the name of &quot;Gilgit Agency&quot;. The unit remained in existence till 1974, after which it was abolished by the Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and turned into the Federally Administered Northern Areas (later renamed to &quot;Gilgit-Baltistan&quot;).

India continues to claim the entire region of Gilgit-Baltistan as part of the union territory of Ladakh.

== Geography ==
The Gilgit Agency was a political agency for keeping control of the subsidiary states of Jammu and Kashmir at the northern frontier of India. The areas under the Agency consisted of
* the state of Chilas (present day Diamer District) 
* the territories of Darel and Tangir (now their own districts)
* Kuh-Ghizar and Yasin regions (present day Gupis–Yasin district)
* Punial and Ishkoman regions (present day Ghizer district)
* the states of Hunza and Nagar (now their own districts)

All these states had their own rulers or systems of administration; the Agency provided supervision under a British Political Agent.

Until 1935, Gilgit and Astore tehsils (now districts) comprised the Gilgit &quot;wazarat&quot; of Jammu and Kashmir with its own governor (&quot;wazir-e-wazarat&quot;), who was also based at Gilgit. However, the Political Agent did exercise some control over the &quot;wazarat&#x27;s&quot; affairs, leading to a system of dual rule and causing frictions.

In 1935, the British leased the Gilgit tehsil as the &quot;Gilgit Leased Area&quot;. It was administered directly by the Political Agent. The Astore tehsil became its own &quot;wazarat&quot;, which was administered as part of the Kashmir province of Jammu and Kashmir.

In 1941, the Gilgit Agency had a population of 77,000 and the Gilgit leased area had 23,000. Both the areas together came to be loosely referred to as the &#x27;Gilgit Agency&#x27;. The administration of the Agency was carried out &quot;on behalf of His Highness&#x27; Government&quot;. The Political Agent communicated with the central government in New Delhi via Peshawar (the capital of the North-West Frontier Province) instead of the Resident in Kashmir, reportedly for &quot;security&quot; reasons.

== History ==
=== After 1700s ===
During the First Anglo-Sikh War, Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal (Dogra) helped the British Empire against the Sikhs. After the defeat of the Sikh Empire, The Treaty of Lahore (1846) and the Treaty of Amritsar (1846) were signed. Under Article IV of The Treaty of Lahore, signed between the Maharaja Duleep Singh and the British Empire, the Sikhs ceded the territories between the rivers Beas and Indus as war indemnity.

IV. The British Government having demanded from the Lahore State, as indemnification for the expenses of the war, in addition to the cession of territory described in Article 3, payment of one and half crore of Rupees, and the Lahore Government being unable to pay the whole of this sum at this time, or to give security satisfactory to the British Government for its eventual payment, the Maharajah cedes to the Honourable Company, in perpetual sovereignty, as equivalent for one crore of Rupees, all his forts, territories, rights and interests in the hill countries, which are situated between the Rivers Beas and Indus, including the Provinces of Cashmere and Hazarah.

In the north, these territories included Gilgit (the present Gilgit District), Astore (the present Astore District) and Chilas (presently a tehsil of the Diamir District). By 1860, the three areas were constituted as a Gilgit &quot;wazarat&quot; (district), and the princely states of Hunza and Nagar to the northeast accepted the suzerainty of the Maharaja Ranbir Singh.

The Treaty of Amritsar did not constrain the Maharaja from establishing relationships with external powers, and he is said to have had dealings with Russia, Afghanistan, China and Turkestan. The British watched these developments with concern, especially in the light of Russian expansion in the north.

=== Establishment ===

Ranbir Singh&#x27;s successor Pratap Singh was a weak ruler. The British used the opportunity to establish an Agency in Gilgit in 1889, stationing a Political Agent who reported to the British Resident in Srinagar. The initial purpose of the Agency was to keep watch on the frontier and to restrain Hunza and Nagar from dealing with the Russians.

By 1889, the House of Ayasho had consolidated complete control over the regions of Punial, Gupis-Yasin, and Ishkoman, incorporating them as provinces under their rule. To emphasize their authority over these territories, the ruling family named the newly unified state &quot;Takht-e-Punial&quot; translating to (Greater Punial). The Ayasho family, of Ismaili origin, was supported by the Syeds, particularly the fathers and uncles of Pir Syed Karam Ali Shah. The British Raj, aiming to strengthen their hold over the area, installed the Ayasho family as perminent rulers and officially recognized the state as a Special Political District. Today, the legacy of the House of Ayasho is carried on by Shehzada Sameer Shah, the current crown prince of the family, who is also known as &quot;Shehzada Syed Sameer Ali Shah Ayasho&quot; and holds the title &quot;Prince of Punial.&quot;

Soon afterwards, the states of Hunza and Nagar were brought under the direct purview of the Gilgit Agency. The Jammu and Kashmir State Forces were stationed in a garrison at Gilgit, which were used by the Agency to keep order. They were replaced by a British-officered Gilgit Scouts in 1913.

Gradually, the princely states to the west of Gilgit (Punial, Yasin, Kuh-Ghizar, Ishkoman and Chitral) were also brought under the purview of the Gilgit Agency. These areas were nominally under the suzerainty of Kashmir but were directly administered by the Agency. Following a rebellion in 1892, Chitral was transferred to the Malakand Agency in the Frontier Areas The remaining areas remained under the control of the Gilgit Agency, which administered them through governors.

== Inside Pakistan (After 1947) ==

The local rulers of these territories continued to appear at the Jammu and Kashmir Durbars until 1947. Following the Partition of India, on 31 October 1947 the British officer William Brown led the Gilgit Scouts in a coup against the Dogra governor of Gilgit which resulted in the region becoming part of the Pakistan administered Kashmir. Most of the Ladakh Wazarat, including the Kargil area, became part of Indian-administered Kashmir. The Line of Control established at the end of the war is the current de facto border of India and Pakistan.

Initially, the Gilgit Agency was not absorbed into any of the provinces of West Pakistan, but was ruled directly by political agents of the federal government of Pakistan. In 1963, Pakistan entered into a treaty with China to transfer part of the Gilgit Agency to China, (the Trans-Karakoram Tract), with the provision that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute.

The dissolution of the province of West Pakistan in 1970 was accompanied by change of the name of the Gilgit Agency to the Northern Areas. In 1974, the states of Hunza and Nagar and the independent valleys of Darel-Tangir, which were the de facto dependencies of Pakistan, were also incorporated into the Northern Areas.

Pakistan and India continue to dispute the sovereignty of the territories that had comprised the Gilgit Agency.

<text>Transamerica Corporation is an American holding company for various life insurance companies and investment firms operating primarily in the United States, offering life and supplemental health insurance, investments, and retirement services. The company has major offices located in Baltimore, Maryland; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Denver, Colorado; Canton, Massachusetts; Harrison, New York; Knoxville, Tennessee; Plano, Texas; St. Paul, Minnesota and St. Petersburg, Florida. Additional affiliated offices are located throughout the United States. In 1999, it became an independent subsidiary of multinational company Aegon.

Contributions from the Transamerica Life Insurance Company and its affiliates fund the Transamerica Institute, a nonprofit, private foundation. The Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies is an operating division of Transamerica Institute.

== History ==

In October 1904, A.P. Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. In October 1928, Giannini created a holding company that he named the Transamerica Corporation, which owned Bank of America, Bank of Italy, Bancitaly Corporation, National Bankitaly Company, California Joint Stock Land Bank, and , which gave it assets in excess of $1.5billion (equivalent to $billion in ). The Transamerica Corporation original headquarters was located at 4 Columbus Avenue in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy later merged with Bank of America, Los Angeles in 1928, which was then renamed Bank of America in 1930.

In March 1930, Transamerica acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company, founded in 1906. At the time, Occidental had over $25million in assets and over $150million in life insurance policies in force. Giannini said the purchase of the West Coast-based life insurance company was part of a plan for Transamerica to control every type of financial service. Following the acquisition, Occidental was renamed Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company. 

Over time, the company became a more diversified conglomerate that included the film distributor United Artists, Transamerica Airlines and Budget Rent a Car.

In 1972, the company completed construction of the Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper in San Francisco which served as its headquarters for many years. Although the company currently retains no offices in the building, the pyramid is still depicted in the company&#x27;s logo and marketing materials.

In the 1980s, Transamerica began to divest and focused exclusively on financial services. In 1981, Transamerica sold United Artists to Tracinda Corporation, a media company owned by Kirk Kerkorian which in turn also owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Transamerica was eventually reduced to three main product divisions: insurance, investments, and retirement planning. In July 1999, Transamerica CEO Frank C. Herringer announced that Aegon, the Netherlands-based insurer, would acquire the company. Transamerica Occidental merged into Transamerica Life Insurance Company on October 1, 2008.

In 2018, Transamerica entered a 10 year, $2 billion agreement with Tata Consultancy Services, an Indian technology company, to digitize their policies under a single platform. However, this project was abandoned in 2023.

After Transamerica introduced the updated logo features the iconic Transamerica Pyramid Center rising boldly from the horizon in a striking red on January 14, 2025, the 1983 and 1989 Transamerica Corporation logos were discontinued.

== Products and services ==
Transamerica primarily offers insurance, retirement, and investment services. Types of life and health insurance policies offered include term life, whole life, universal life, variable universal life, accidental death, and final expense. Transamerica companies also offer a variety of mutual funds and annuities.

Transamerica&#x27;s retirement division offers defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans, including 401(k) and 403(b), 457, profit sharing, money purchase, cash balance, Taft-Hartley, multiple employer plans, pooled employer plans, retirement plan exchanges, nonqualified deferred compensation, and rollover individual retirement accounts. Other services include plan-level record keeping and administrative services, participant communications and education services, fiduciary risk mitigation services, open investment architecture, and compliance guidance and regulatory support.

In December 2020, Transamerica announced it would no longer sell variable annuities with benefit riders and fixed index annuities and is also exiting the standalone long-term care market.

== Partnerships ==
Transamerica has a long history of supporting third-party research and thought leadership, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab. Previous work includes American Heart Association, Stanford&#x27;s Center on Longevity, Georgetown&#x27;s AgingWell Hub, and Alzheimer&#x27;s Association.

Transamerica has sponsored Zach Johnson his entire PGA TOUR career. The 2023 US Ryder Cup team captain and 12-time PGA TOUR winner, including the 2007 Masters and 2015 Open Championship, Johnson grew up in the Cedar Rapids community, home to many Transamerica employees. Transamerica is also a longtime sponsor of Azahara Munoz, 2009 LPGA Rookie of the Year. 

== Foundations ==
Transamerica funds two foundations: the Aegon Transamerica Foundation and the Transamerica Institute. It created the Aegon Transamerica Foundation in 1994 to provide financial grants to community non-profit organizations. Transamerica employees also volunteer services to these organizations. The foundation received the Corporate Citizenship Award in 2013 for creating the first urban farm in Iowa.

Transamerica Institute is a nonprofit, private foundation dedicated to identifying, researching, and educating the public about health and wellness, employment, financial literacy, longevity, and retirement. Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS), an operating division of Transamerica Institute, focuses on trends, issues, and opportunities related to saving and planning for retirement and achieving financial security in retirement.

<doc id="1002312" wikidata="Q4959901" url="?curid=1002312" title="Breathing Fire">
<text>Breathing Fire is a 1991 American martial arts film directed by Lou Kennedy in his directorial debut, and co-directed by Brandon De-Wilde. The film stars Ke Huy Quan, with a supporting cast of Eddie Saavedra, Ed Neil and Jerry Trimble. The film was released on direct-to-VHS in the United States on July 15, 1992.

It is a remake of the 1977 Hong Kong film &quot;The Flash Legs&quot; that starred Tao-liang Tan, who executive produced and wrote this film under the pseudonym of Delon Tanners. This was Eddie Saavedra&#x27;s first and only American film. After the film, Saavedra has retired from acting.

==Plot==
Michael Moore, a Vietnam vet, pulls off a bank heist with his gang, which includes the bank&#x27;s manager. To ensure the loyalty of everyone involved, a set of keys is made to the hiding place for the loot so it can only be opened if all the members are present. These sets of keys were encrusted in a fake pizza mold that was later sliced and given to the gang. The bank manager gets cold feet and tries to back out, but Michael and his henchman arrive to kill him and his wife in their home.

The bank manager&#x27;s daughter Annie gets hold of the key and runs for help to David Moore, one of her father&#x27;s old friends and also a Vietnam vet as well as Michael&#x27;s brother. David does some investigation, alongside Michael&#x27;s two sons, Charlie and Tony, to find out who murdered the girl&#x27;s parents. During his investigation, a disguised Michael cripples David. Charlie and Tony, having seen David fight, are impressed with his skills and asks him to train them. At first, David refuses. However, when the brothers are able to prove their bravery when they kneel on bricks overnight. David begins training the brothers. When the brothers&#x27; investigation leads them to one of Michael&#x27;s gang members, Tank, a confrontation leads to Tank having a change of heart for the sake of his mother. Tank decides to help the brothers gain intel but Michael eventually finds out and kills Tank. Meanwhile, Tony and Charlie use their new skills first on gang member Alan and eventually, the hulking Thunder.

When David and Charlie eventually learn Michael is the gang leader and the one who killed the bank manager, Michael confronts the two. However, trouble brews up when Michael reveals why he adopted his son Charlie. During their time in Vietnam, David caught Michael killing Charlie&#x27;s birth mother and had convinced him to adopt the orphaned baby. Shocked, Charlie is at first upset but then attempts to reason with Michael. However, Michael&#x27;s arrogance and ultimatum leads to a showdown between father and son. When Michael is arrested, Tony arrives and not knowing the truth, puts the blame on Charlie. Tony vows to settle the score with Charlie at the national taekwondo tournament. Both Charlie and Tony eventually make the finals and Charlie at first refuses to fight Tony. After getting berated by the referee, Charlie finally fights back until he lets Tony knock him out. Tony wins but is even more in regret when he sees an unconscious Charlie. Tony attempts to help wake Charlie up and when he does, the brothers finally make amends with Tony the winner of the tournament.

Zang in Bradbury, California.

The idea of the film came from former kung fu star Tan Tao-liang, who used the pseudonym &quot;Delon Tanners&quot;. Tan was running his martial arts school in Monterey Park, California at the time and was a mentor to actor Ke Huy Quan. Tan took the idea partly from his 1977 film Shaolin Deadly Kicks, which had a similar premise of a gang who steals a key and splits it in pieces. Tan also served as executive producer on the film.

<doc id="1002327" wikidata="Q200674" url="?curid=1002327" title="Latin cross">
<text>A Latin cross or  is a type of cross in which the beam sticks above the , giving the cross four arms. Typically the two horizontal and upper vertical arm are the same length, although sometimes the vertical is shorter, however the lower vertical arm is always much longer than any other arm.

If displayed it is called St. Peter&#x27;s Cross, because he was executed on this type of cross. When displayed sideways it is called St. Philip&#x27;s cross for the same reason.

Many medieval churches are designed using the Latin cross plan. When looked at from above, it takes the shape of a Latin cross. A Latin cross plan primarily contains a nave, transept, apse, and narthex.

==History==

In a broad sense, the Latin cross is used to represent all of Christianity and Christendom, given that it teaches that Jesus sacrificed himself for humanity upon it, atoning for the sins of the world. It is especially used among the denominations of Western Christianity, including the Roman Catholic tradition and several Protestant traditions, such as Lutheranism, Moravianism, Anglicanism, Methodism, and Reformed Christianity, as well as by Anabaptists, Baptists, and Pentecostals. In certain periods, such as during the 16th century English Reformation of the Anglican Church, the Latin cross was disfavored by a minority of theologians such as Nicholas Ridley, though in the overall history of the Western Christian Churches, this was short-lived.

==Cruciform Churches==

A Latin cross plan is a floor plan found in many Christian churches and cathedrals. When looked at from above or in plan view it takes the shape of a Latin cross (). Such cruciform churches were very common in the West during the Romanesque period. The ideal church plan tended to be symmetrical around a central point during the Renaissance. The longer arm of the Latin cross plan is the nave, which runs on an east–west axis and traditionally contains aisles or chapels. The transept crosses the nave, running north–south, and can be the same width as the nave, or extend further on both sides to create a more pronounced cross shape. The east end is the apse, which traditionally contains the choir, chancel, or presbytery. Many also have a narthex at the entry.

=== Examples of Cathedrals with a Latin Cross Plan ===

* Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is a cathedral in Rome, Italy, that was consecrated in 326 AD
* Chartres Cathedral is a cathedral in Chartres, France, that was constructed between 1194 and 1220
* Siena Cathedral is a cathedral in Siena, Italy, that was completed between 1215 and 1263
* Cologne Cathedral is a cathedral in Cologne, Germany, that began construction in 1248, but was halted in 1590, unfinished until 1880
* Notre-Dame is a cathedral in Paris, France, that was largely completed by 1260
* Florence Cathedral is a cathedral in Florence, Italy, that was structurally completed in 1436

<doc id="1002347" wikidata="Q5445891" url="?curid=1002347" title="Festál">
<text>Festál is a free series of annual ethnically-related festivals that take place on the grounds of Seattle Center in Seattle, Washington. A major cultural program of Seattle, these festivals aim to celebrate and connect the city to its varied ethnic and international community. Most festivals contain various arts performances (dances, theatre, musical ensembles, films), dances, marketplace and other programs. These have also come to be the annual gathering place for ethnic groups of the community. Both older and younger people attend, especially the dances and musical concerts.

The Festál events range enormously in scope, from smaller festivals to the enormous pan-ethnic Northwest Folklife Festival, which draws an estimated 250,000 visitors on Memorial Day weekend. Typical Festál events draw 5,000 to 30,000 visitors. Some of them (such as Fiestas Patrias) draw crowds that are predominantly of the ethnic group that is the focus of the festival; others draw more of a cross-section of the city.

Festál began in 1996 and includes (all of those have been on hiatus on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020):

The trees were planted along Lake Washington Boulevard, Seward Park, Seattle Center, The Arboretum, the Seattle Japanese Garden, University of Washington, and the Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Temple.

The cherry tree tradition follows at every year&#x27;s festival, by bringing cherry tree experts from Japan to Seattle to teach Washingtonians about the proper care and maintenance of cherry trees. The cherry tree experts give instruction during the festival and the week that follows.

The festival&#x27;s mission is to deepen mutual understanding between the people of Japan and the people of the Northwest; to exchange ideas and friendship; to promote the culture, arts, and technologies of Japan, including achievements of the Japanese-American community.

This festival marks the Lunar New Year of this Southeast Asian highland culture originating in the mountains of China, Laos and Thailand. Hmong people preserved their stories and language through intricate storytelling, embroidery, music and unusual communication techniques. Highlights include traditional ball-tossing, dances, children&#x27;s activities, a fashion show and a Hmong band.

<doc id="1002348" wikidata="Q7980696" url="?curid=1002348" title="Welcome to Holland">
<text>&quot;Welcome to Holland&quot; is a prominent essay, written in 1987 by American author and social activist Emily Perl Kingsley, about having a child with a disability. The piece is given by many organizations to new parents of children with special needs issues such as Down syndrome. As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name &quot;Holland&quot;.

Emily Kingsley is the mother of Jason Kingsley. The younger Kingsley is an actor who has appeared on programs such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and enjoyed a varied career, despite the family being told early in his childhood that his struggles would prevent him from having a meaningful life. &quot;Welcome to Holland&quot;, written in the second person, employs a metaphor of excitement for a vacation to Italy that first becomes disappointment when the plane lands instead in Holland and then contentment at the happy events which they experience instead.

==Background and contents==
The metaphor is that the trip to Italy is a typical birth and child-raising experience, and that the trip to Holland is the experiencing of having and raising a child with special needs.

In the end, however, the reader sees that the &quot;trip&quot; is still well worth it:

Author and social activist Emily Perl Kingsley wrote the piece based on her experiences with her son, Jason Kingsley, and her changing beliefs through parenthood. The younger Kingsley was born in 1974 with Down syndrome. Their doctor labeled the child as a &quot;mongoloid&quot; that would fail to learn to speak or walk and instructed the parents to act essentially as if the birth hadn&#x27;t happened, with the mother sent to receive tranquilizing drugs preventing lactation. She recounted that she cried for several days straight.

Although such medical attitudes were consistent with the prejudices of the time, the distraught family resisted and determined to provide the boy with as intellectually stimulating an environment as possible. Accounts of widespread abuse as a result of controversial institutionalization policies served to spur them on even more. The younger Kingsley has worked as an actor, appearing on programs such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and otherwise enjoyed a varied career despite various challenges.

==Responses and influence==
As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name &quot;Holland&quot;. In 2004, Will Livingston wrote a song loosely based on the story. He also used the title &quot;Welcome to Holland&quot;.

Critical analysis of the work and its influence has compared it to poet Robert Frost&#x27;s piece &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, which also discusses the human tendency to look back and fret about &#x27;what might have been&#x27; after people make decisions.

A response essay describing the possible toll that parenting can take on a family&#x27;s welfare, such as raising children with severe autism, was created titled &quot;Welcome to Beirut&quot;, with the later piece alluding to the suffering from the Lebanese Civil War. &quot;Welcome to Holland&quot; has also attracted some amused, humorous responses from individuals living in both Holland and Italy in contrast to the original story&#x27;s American perspective; for example, in Amsterdam, &quot;even the tourists say there are too many tourists&quot;, noting the graphic provided by NPR.

<doc id="1002350" wikidata="Q7575719" url="?curid=1002350" title="Speedy Eggbert">
<text>Speedy Eggbert, originally Speedy Blupi, is a video game for Windows based PCs developed by EPSITEC, and released on September 13, 1998 as an independent title. It is part of the Blupi series, and the successor to &quot;Planet Blupi&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Speedy Blupi II&quot;, was also released, and renamed by eGames to &quot;Speedy Eggbert 2&quot;. &quot;Speedy Blupi&quot; has been released as freeware by EPSITEC, and is available at blupi.org, Planet Blupi was released Open-source under GPLv3 on GitHub in 2017.

==Gameplay==
The whole game is centered on a central hub, in which the player character Blupi (alias Eggbert) can access all of the game&#x27;s seven themed worlds to embark on challenging treasure hunting quests within these worlds that are rigged and bomb-planted by other multi-colored Blupis who are keeping each hub world locked and guarded. At first, he can only go to the practice level, where he will learn most of the controls listed above. The rest of the controls are not shown to during the practice game; they are left for the player to discover these moves while passing through the levels.

The game has over forty levels, ranging from easy to relatively difficult. The objective of each level is to collect all the treasure chests and then move to the endpoint. The game includes enemies which Blupi cannot destroy normally, but can be destroyed using the Helicopter, the Glue Tank and self-placed yellow mines.

The Jeep and Skateboard allow Blupi to destroy all kinds of mines them without losing a life. Glue balls can be collected by Blupi, where they can be fired as weapons from the Glue Tank or Helicopter to defeat enemies. There are also deductive problems to be solved and errors may make finishing the level impossible (by for example, accidentally destroying all helicopters available).

===Level editor===
Players can create up to 20 custom missions on their account, for a total of 160 custom missions across all players. They can use all the objects, enemies, and vehicles to make their levels. However, they cannot make the large keys and doors on single player mode. The custom missions in game can be saved to the codice_1 directory as .XCH files, which can later be loaded to import older missions.

== Development ==
&quot;Speedy Blupi&quot; was later published by eGames and rereleased as &quot;Speedy Eggbert&quot;. The game was featured in the CD-ROM game package &quot;Arcade Classics&quot;, which featured other eGames titles, such as &quot;DemonStar&quot; and &quot;Crazy Drake&quot;.

==Sequel==
Among the changes noticeable in the sequel, &quot;Speedy Eggbert 2&quot;, are the addition of keys and lock barriers, teleporters, special barriers that only open when a specified number of treasure boxes have been collected, new enemies for Eggbert to defeat, and the addition of new themes, such as slime, cavern, cheese, and palace. A new vehicle, the hovercraft, is introduced in &quot;Speedy Eggbert 2&quot;. The player is also still allowed to create their own levels.

Eggbert also appears as a robot in the &quot;Taxi 1&quot; game in the computer game &quot;Wild Wheels&quot;, consisting of various missions and races, all to be accomplished by a remote-controlled car. There, he is one of three robots to be taken to their work stations in as short a time as possible and with as little damage as possible to the taxi. In another, a number of Eggberts, undergoing torture, have to be rescued before their execution.

Dunston was the first overall pick in the 1982 MLB draft by the Chicago Cubs, and played for the Cubs (1985–95, 1997), San Francisco Giants (1996, 1998, 2001–02), Pittsburgh Pirates (1997), Cleveland Indians (1998), St. Louis Cardinals (1999, 2000) and New York Mets (1999). Dunston was named an All-Star in 1988 and 1990.

==Early life==
Dunston was born in the East New York section of Brooklyn, New York City, on March 21, 1963. As a youth, he lived in the Linden Apartments, a public housing facility, with his father, Jack, mother, Brenda, and younger sister, Kindra. Jack worked as a cab driver and delivered furniture, while Brenda worked in a women&#x27;s clothing store.

Dunston attended the nearby Thomas Jefferson High School. He played for the school&#x27;s baseball team as an infielder. In his senior season at Thomas Jefferson, Dunston had a .790 batting average, 10 home runs, and stole 37 bases without being caught stealing in 26 games.

==Playing career==
As a shortstop, Dunston was considered one of the best prospects available in the 1982 Major League Baseball draft. The Chicago Cubs selected Dunston with the first overall selection of the draft out of Thomas Jefferson High School. He was the first player from the New York area to be chosen with the first overall pick in the draft. Opting to represent himself, Dunston signed a one-year contract with the Cubs for $100,000, and was assigned to the Cubs&#x27; Rookie-level minor league baseball affiliate in the Gulf Coast League.

Dunston competed with Larry Bowa for the role as the starting shortstop for the Cubs in spring training in 1985. Dunston initially won the job over Bowa. He made his debut in the major leagues on April 9. However, Dunston struggled offensively and defensively, batting .194 and committing nine errors in 23 games. As a result, he was sent back to the minor leagues, with Bowa regaining the starting role. After playing well for the Iowa Cubs, the Cubs recalled Dunston in August, and released Bowa.

In and he joined double-play partner Ryne Sandberg as an All-Star and was a key contributor to the Cubs&#x27; NL East division title in , hitting .278 with 20 doubles, 6 triples, 9 home runs, 60 runs batted in and 19 stolen bases. Due to become a free agent after the 1991 season, Dunston instead signed a four-year, $12 million contract to remain with the Cubs without testing the open market. However, he injured his back that offseason, and required surgery to repair a herniated disk in May 1992. The Cubs opted not to protect Dunston from being eligible to be selected in the 1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but neither the Colorado Rockies nor the Florida Marlins selected him.

After the 1995 season, he was granted free agency. The Cubs wanted to move Dunston to third base, but he preferred to remain at shortstop. As a result, he signed with the San Francisco Giants for the 1996 season, receiving a one-year contract worth $1.5 million. He signed with the Cubs for the 1997 season, receiving $2 million.

On August 31, 1997, the Cubs traded Dunston to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who lost two shortstops, Kevin Elster and Kevin Polcovich, to injuries. He hit two home runs in his first game with the Pirates, and three in his first three games. He became a free agent after the season, and signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians for $400,000. On July 23, 1998, the Indians traded Dunston, José Mesa, and Alvin Morman to the Giants for Jacob Cruz and Steve Reed. Dunston was batting .237 at the time of the trade. With the Giants, Dunston batted .176 in 51 at-bats. Dunston became a free agent after the season and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a one-year contract worth $500,000.

On July 31, 1999, the Cardinals traded Dunston to the New York Mets for Craig Paquette. He replaced rookie Melvin Mora on the Mets roster. Dunston became a free agent after the season and signed with the Cardinals for the 2000 season. He signed with the Giants that next offseason, playing with them in 2001 and 2002. He reached the 2002 World Series, his first, as a member of the Giants. He hit a home run off Kevin Appier of the Anaheim Angels in game six to give his team a two run lead in what could have been a championship clinching game for the Giants, but the Angels came back to win the game and eventually the series.

Dunston was a career .269 hitter with 150 home runs and 668 RBI in 1814 games. He seldom walked, so in spite of his batting average, his on-base percentage was the second-worst among players with at least 4500 plate appearances during their careers. At the end of his career, he was used mainly as a fourth outfielder and a role player off the bench.
He wore jersey #12 while with the Chicago Cubs.

==Playing style==
Bill James noted that Dunston was an &quot;eternal rookie, a player who continued until the end of his career to make rookie mistakes.&quot; Dunston was known, especially early in his career, for his unusually strong throwing arm at the shortstop position.

He won the 1996 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership.

==Post-playing career==
Dunston became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008; 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.2% of the vote, thus being dropped off the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America&#x27;s ballot.

During his career, Dunston resided in Fremont, California. 

==Personal==
Dunston has a son, Shawon Jr., who has played minor league baseball. One of Dunston&#x27;s three daughters, Jasmine Dunston, became the White Sox Director of Minor League Operations in 2022.

<text>Berikon is a municipality in the district of Bremgarten in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

The village lies on a hill above and to the east of the Reuss Valley, covering part of the Mutschellen Pass. This municipality is bounded by Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg, Widen, Zufikon, and Oberwil-Lieli, all in canton Aargau, and shares a boundary with the canton of Zürich (district of Dietikon) to the east.

==History==
Berikon was mentioned for the first time in 1153 as a court place &quot;Berchheim&quot;. In 1184 it was mentioned as &quot;Berchein&quot;. Over time, the name of the place changed from Berchheim to Bergheim, then to Berchan, Berkein, and finally Berikon.

The originally separate settlements Unterberikon (Lower Berikon) and Oberberikon (Upper Berikon) fell under the territorial lordship of the city of Zürich in 1415, when the &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; (Confederacy) conquered Aargau. Later, in 1471, Unterberikon became part of &quot;Amt&quot; Rohrdorf in the county of Baden, while Oberberikon fell under the oversight of the Kelleramt (Freiamt Affoltern).

When in 1798 the French overran Switzerland and instituted the Helvetic Republic, both municipalities came to the short-lived canton of Baden. During the establishment of the canton of Aargau in 1803, the two municipalities were reunited and joined the district of Bremgarten.

On 1 May 1902, the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn was opened, giving Berikon a railway connection to the rest of Switzerland. Still, until well into the 20th century, Berikon was a rural village, populated by just 900 inhabitants in 1950, before a sudden boom of construction activity occurred. Within thirty years the total population increased by over 150%. Today&#x27;s population is roughly quadruple that of the 1960s. Berikon has grown together with the neighbouring municipalities and is today part of the agglomeration of Zürich.

==Geography==
Berikon has an area, , of . Of this area, 49.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 31.4% is forested. The rest of the land, (18.9%) is settled.

The municipality is located in the Bremgarten district, and is located on the &quot;Mutschellenhöhe&quot;. It consists of the originally separate villages of Ober- and Unter-Berikon.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Argent a Trefoil slipped Vert&quot;.

==Demographics==
At the end of 2008 Berikon had 4,491 residents, of whom 591 (13.2%) were non-Swiss, and 50.2% were female. Berikon had a population of , of which 13.9% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. According to the federal census of 2000, the 4358 residents in 1821 households included only 464 foreigners (10.6%).

 the average number of residents per living room was 0.56 which is about equal to the cantonal average of 0.57 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 34.9% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement). , there were 127 homes with 1 or 2 persons in the household, 952 homes with 3 or 4 persons in the household, and 684 homes with 5 or more persons in the household. The average number of people per household was 2.40 individuals. there were 548 single family homes (or 27.5% of the total) out of a total of 1,993 homes and apartments. There were a total of 17 empty apartments for a 0.9% vacancy rate. , the construction rate of new housing units was 0.5 new units per 1000 residents.

==Administration==
The legislative function is exercised by the &quot;Gemeindeversammlung&quot; or town meeting. The executive in Berikon is handled by a five-member &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; (town council), the members of which are elected by a plurality voting system for a four-year term. The &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; leads and represents the village, as well as performing the tasks determined by the &quot;Gemeindeversammlung&quot;, as well as those delegated by the canton and federal agencies.

Minor legal and civil disagreements fall under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Friedensrichterkreis&quot; (similar to a Justice of the Peace) of Bremgarten.

In the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the SVP which received 34.2% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SP (18.7%), the CVP (18.1%) and the FDP (14.1%).

==Education==
In Berikon about 84.7% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;). Of the school age population (), there are 334 students attending primary school, there are 312 students attending secondary school, there are 284 students attending tertiary or university level schooling in the municipality.

Berikon has primary schools of its own from kindergarten up through intermediate school (Bezirksschule, grades 6 through 9). The nearest Kantonsschule (canton school), a secondary school, is in Wohlen.

==Economy==

, Berikon had an unemployment rate of 2.46%. , there were 85 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 22 businesses involved in this sector. 142 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 33 businesses in this sector. 956 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 191 businesses in this sector.

 there were 2,504 total workers who lived in the municipality. Of these, 2,037 or about 81.3% of the residents worked outside Berikon while 644 people commuted into the municipality for work. There were a total of 1,111 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality. Of the working population, 19.5% used public transportation to get to work, and 56.9% used a private car. The majority of the working residents commute to jobs in the city of Zürich or in the towns of the nearby Limmat Valley (Dietikon, Spreitenbach, Schlieren).

==Transportation==
The Berikon-Widen station of the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn stands right on the Mutschellen pass. This station is a stop of the S-Bahn Zürich on the line S17 serviced by the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn. Buses of two Postauto lines, each with a terminus at Berikon-Widen station, connect the Mutschellen communities with Baden to the north and Zürich at the Wiedikon station to the east. The No. 350 Postauto line to Zürich Wiedikon also affords a good connection in Birmensdorf with the S9 and S15 train lines to Zürich, Affoltern am Albis, and Zug.

Before the A1 expressway was built, the Mutschellen pass was the main connection for auto traffic between Zürich and Bern. Now, the road to Bern (&quot;Bernstrasse&quot; or &quot;Hauptstrasse 1&quot;) is still an important carrier of road traffic, particularly commuters. With the completion of the A4 expressway (scheduled November 2009) much more traffic (at least 5% by 2015) is expected through Berikon for travellers heading for the interchange at Birmensdorf (approx. 3 km away). Berikon has begun roadwork with a view to reduce the flow of transit vehicles. The project implementing these remedial measures is planned to last some 2.5 years and should be completed in autumn of 2011.

<text>Skeeter Davis (born Mary Frances Penick; December 30, 1931September 19, 2004) was an American country music singer and songwriter who sang crossover pop music songs including 1962&#x27;s &quot;The End of the World&quot;. She started out as part of the Davis Sisters as a teenager in the late 1940s, eventually recording for RCA Victor. In the late 1950s, she became a solo star.

One of the first women to achieve major stardom in the country music field as a solo vocalist, she was an acknowledged influence on Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton and was hailed as an &quot;extraordinary country/pop singer&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Robert Palmer.

==Early life==
Davis was born Mary Frances Penick on December 30, 1931, the first of seven children born to farmer William Lee and Sarah Rachel Penick (née Roberts), in Glencoe, Kentucky. Because her grandfather thought she had a lot of energy for a young child, he nicknamed Mary Frances &quot;Skeeter&quot; (slang for mosquito), a name she carried for the rest of her life.
When Davis was a toddler, her great-uncle was convicted of murdering her maternal grandfather (his brother) in Indiana. After this incident, Davis recalled that her mother became a &quot;bitterly depressed woman&quot;. Throughout her childhood, Davis&#x27;s mother made multiple suicide attempts, several of which Davis herself prevented from being carried out: &quot;I once slapped a bottle of Clorox she was drinking out of her mouth and sat on her hands to keep her from reaching for a butcher knife,&quot; she recalled. On one occasion, her mother attempted to leap from the family&#x27;s apartment window with Davis and her infant brother in her arms. Her relationship with her mother remained strained throughout much of her life, and by Davis&#x27;s account, she &quot;couldn&#x27;t seem to win my mother&#x27;s respect and affection, [so] I turned my attention toward my daddy.&quot;

In the mid-1930s, the Penick family relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, where they remained for several years before returning to Dry Ridge. They later moved to Erlanger, Kentucky, in 1947. Davis was raised a Protestant, attending Disciples of Christ churches. As an adolescent, Davis was inspired by the music of Betty Hutton and also developed interest in musicals, memorizing songs from films such as &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; (1944). She would sometimes stage routines in her backyard, dancing, singing, and telling ghost stories to neighborhood children. When Davis was in seventh grade, her father relocated to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for work. She and her siblings remained in the care of their mother who, during this time, became an alcoholic. In the summer of 1948, Davis and her family relocated to Covington, Kentucky, where her father was working as an electrician and moved into a house owned by the Villa Madonna Academy, run by Benedictine nuns. Davis became fascinated by the sisters, and for a time considered becoming a nun.

While attending Dixie Heights High School in Erlanger, Skeeter met Betty Jack Davis, and the two became close friends, bonding over their love of music. They began singing songs and playing guitar together during breaks at school, which drew attention from their classmates, and they performed in several school talent shows. On a trip to the Grand Ole Opry, the two convinced a stage manager to allow them backstage, where they met Hank Williams and Chet Atkins.

==Career==
===1948–1956: The Davis Sisters; rise to fame===

During her junior year of high school, Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis won a local yodeling contest, the prize for which was a time slot singing on a local daytime television show. The two were billed as the Davis Sisters, with Skeeter adopting Betty Jack&#x27;s last name, despite their being unrelated. Their appearance on the local program led to them receiving singing opportunities on the Detroit radio station WJR&#x27;s program &quot;Barnyard Frolics&quot;. After graduating from high school in 1949, Davis relocated to Detroit with Betty Jack, where they completed demonstration recordings for Fortune Records; among these was the song &quot;Jealous Love&quot;, which was released as a single in 1953.

RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes heard their demos and was impressed by their harmonies. In the spring of 1953, Skeeter and Betty Jack met with Sholes at RCA&#x27;s headquarters in New York City, and were offered a recording contract. After signing the contract, they left New York to begin recording material in Nashville, Tennessee. On May 23, 1953, they recorded &quot;I Forgot More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot;, a song that had previously been recorded by Sonny James. The Davis Sisters toured regionally to support the single on live broadcast radio programs, though Davis recalled that both &quot;were so insecure and uninformed about the [music] business.&quot; The single was a significant success, spending eight weeks at number one on the country charts in 1953, as well as making the top 20 on the pop charts. The record ranks number 65 on the Top 100 Country Singles of All Time, according to &quot;Billboard&quot; historian Joel Whitburn.

On August 1, 1953, the Davis Sisters performed on the WWVA evening show in Wheeling, West Virginia. After midnight, the two left Wheeling en route back to Covington. Around 7:00 am on August 2, near Cincinnati, a passing motorist fell asleep at the wheel, crashing head-on with the car in which Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis were riding. Betty Jack was killed in the collision, while Skeeter sustained serious head injuries. The driver of the car also survived. Newspaper bulletins at the time erroneously reported that both the Davis Sisters had been pronounced dead at Our Lady of Sorrow Hospital in Cincinnati.

Following the accident, Davis moved in with Betty Jack&#x27;s mother, Ollie, while recovering from her injuries. She recounted in her autobiography that Ollie &quot;took advantage of this tragic situation to suit her own ends”, alleging that she had kept Skeeter sedated with drugs from a local dentist and sequestered her in the house, where she repeatedly played the girls&#x27; records. Once Skeeter recovered, Ollie could &quot;hardly wait for her chance to re-create the Davis Sisters&quot;, suggesting that Betty Jack&#x27;s younger sister, Georgia, take her place in the singing duo. Davis reluctantly agreed, and six months after the accident she resumed singing in the duo with Georgia Davis. In her autobiography, she wrote that she felt she had been brainwashed by Ollie and coerced into resuming the musical duo.

Between 1954 and 1956, Skeeter and Georgia released a total of nine singles for RCA as the Davis Sisters, which they recorded in New York City and Chicago, and toured the United States as a part of the RCA Caravan of the Stars alongside Minnie Pearl, Hawkshaw Hawkins, and Chet Atkins, among others. The singles recorded with Georgia were notably less successful than the duo&#x27;s former material, with low chart positions, though Davis felt that &quot;the material was good.&quot; The two held a tribute performance for Betty Jack at the Grand Ole Opry in 1954. In 1955, the Davis Sisters were booked for a regional tour alongside Hank Snow, The Carter Sisters (minus June), and Elvis Presley. Davis recounted her friendship with Presley in her autobiography. The Davis Sisters formally disbanded in 1956, shortly after Davis&#x27;s first marriage to Kenneth DePew.

===1957–1962: Early solo career===

In the late 1950s during her marriage to DePew, Davis suffered from depression and &quot;harbored a death wish&quot; over the grief of Betty Jack&#x27;s death as well as her &quot;contrived&quot; marriage. She resumed performing as a solo act, touring with Ernest Tubb, and co-wrote and recorded the song &quot;Set Him Free&quot; for RCA, produced by Chet Atkins. The song earned Davis a Grammy Award nomination for best country recording. Sometime during this period, 1958, Davis and DePew were divorced, and she relocated to Nashville. The same year, Davis recorded &quot;Lost to a Geisha Girl&quot;, an answer song to Hank Locklin&#x27;s hit &quot;Geisha Girl&quot;, which reached the country number 15 and became her first solo hit. Atkins worked with Davis as a guitarist on all of these sessions. At Davis&#x27;s suggestion, Atkins frequently multiple-tracked Davis&#x27;s voice for harmony vocals to resemble the sound of the Davis Sisters. This echo can be found on several of her early solo hits, such as &quot;Am I That Easy to Forget&quot;.

She subsequently cowrote and recorded another top-20 hit called ‘Homebreaker’ , which peaked at number 15 on the Hot Country Songs chart in November 1959. The same year, Davis joined the Grand Ole Opry. During this time, she toured with June Carter, and the two became good friends.

From 1960 to 1962, Davis had top-10 hits with the songs &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Help You) I&#x27;m Falling Too&quot;, &quot;My Last Date (With You)&quot;, &quot;Where I Ought to Be&quot;, and &quot;Optimistic&quot;. &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Help You) I&#x27;m Falling Too&quot; marked Davis&#x27;s first entrance as a solo artist onto the Billboard pop charts in 1960 and resulted in her being invited to perform on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The song went all the way to the top 40, unheard of for a female country singer at the time. In 1961, she scored a second pop hit with a lyric version (written by Skeeter) of Floyd Cramer&#x27;s instrumental country pop smash &quot;Last Date&quot; called &quot;My Last Date (With You)&quot; which did even better, making the top 30 on the pop charts. Both of these songs did exceptionally well on the country charts, peaking at number two and number five, respectively.

===1963–1976: Crossover and critical accolades===
In 1963, Davis achieved her biggest success with country pop crossover hit &quot;The End of the World&quot;. The song just missed topping the country and pop charts that year; however, it did top the adult contemporary charts. The record was also a surprise top-five hit on the rhythm and blues charts, making Davis one of the few white female singers to have a top-10 hit in that market. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. &quot;The End of the World&quot; soon became Davis&#x27;s signature song. Davis achieved one other country-pop hit with the Gerry Goffin and Carole King-penned &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stay Mad at You&quot;, which peaked at number seven on the pop charts and number two on the Easy Listening chart in 1963. In 1964, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her recording of &quot;He Says the Same Things to Me&quot;.

Davis&#x27;s success continued with &quot;I&#x27;m Saving My Love&quot; and 1964&#x27;s &quot;Gonna Get Along Without You Now&quot;, an updated cover of a 1956 hit by Patience and Prudence. Both made the top 10 on the country charts and cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 50 pop charts, though the success of &quot;Gonna Get&quot; was likely hampered by another remake of the song by vocalist Tracey Dey simultaneously climbing the charts to peak slightly lower than Davis&#x27;s version. Later pop efforts, such as &quot;Let Me Get Close to You&quot; in July 1964, missed making the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reflecting the changing nature of pop styles due to the ongoing British invasion. In 1965, she recorded a duet with Bobby Bare called &quot;A Dear John Letter&quot;, which just missed the country top 10. The following year, she earned her third Grammy nomination for &quot;Sun Glasses&quot;, which peaked at number 30 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

In 1967, Davis was back in the top 10 with &quot;What Does It Take (To Keep a Man Like You Satisfied)&quot;. Davis only achieved two other major country hits the rest of the decade, &quot;Fuel to the Flame&quot; (written by Dolly Parton, to whom Davis paid tribute with an album called &quot;Skeeter Sings Dolly&quot; in 1972), and &quot;There&#x27;s a Fool Born Every Minute&quot;. She received her fourth Grammy nomination for 1967&#x27;s &quot;What Does It Take&quot;.

In the late 1960s, she recorded several full-length albums, including two tribute works: &quot;Skeeter Davis Sings Buddy Holly&quot; (1967) and &quot;I Love Flatt and Scruggs&quot; (1968). Davis&#x27;s recording of the anti-war song &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot;, released in 1972, earned her an appearance on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. The single was a major success in Canada, peaking as a top-ten hit on &quot;RPM&quot; country and adult contemporary charts.

In 1970, Davis had another top-10 hit with &quot;I&#x27;m a Lover (Not a Fighter)&quot; and another duet with Bobby Bare with &quot;Your Husband, My Wife&quot;. The following year, she had a hit with the autobiographical &quot;Bus Fare To Kentucky&quot;. Subsequently, however, her chart success began to fade. Singles such as &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be a Woman&quot; and &quot;Love Takes a Lot of My Time&quot; failed to crack the country top 40. Her last major hit was 1973&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe That It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, which peaked at number 12 in country and number 101 on the pop chart. In the 1970s, she began regularly touring foreign countries such as Barbados, Singapore, and Sweden, where she retained a following.

Davis had the first and only controversy of her career when, during a 1973 Grand Ole Opry performance, she dedicated a gospel song to a group of young church workers whom she noted in her introduction had been arrested for evangelizing at a local mall. The Opry suspended her from membership after receiving complaints from some local policemen. She was reinstated at the Opry more than a year later. After losing several bookings during that period, Davis became active singing with a number of religious ministries and spent an extensive period evangelizing in Africa.

===1977–2004: Later life and career===
Davis returned to the recording studio in 1976 with a brief stint on Mercury Records, which produced two single releases, including her last song to make the national charts, 1976&#x27;s &quot;I Love Us&quot;. In 1978, she recorded the first of several albums for minor record labels which she did on occasion into the 1990s.

She recorded the album &quot;She Sings, They Play&quot; with her third husband, bassist Joey Spampinato and his band, NRBQ. Her autobiography, &quot;Bus Fare to Kentucky&quot; (named after her 1971 song), was published in 1993. In 1998, she wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Christmas Note&quot;, with Cathie Pelletier.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and marriages===
In 1956, Davis met Kenneth DePew, a railroad worker and acquaintance of Georgia. The two began dating and married shortly after, though Davis would later state that he had married her for her income: &quot;He saw the nice new furniture my money had bought the Davises; he saw the Oldsmobile and knew I had money in the bank. I could be a short cut to easy street.&quot; According to Davis, their marriage was not consummated until eight days into their honeymoon. The couple divorced in late 1959.

In 1960, she married WSM disc jockey Ralph Emery in Franklin, Kentucky. Their marriage was tumultuous, with Davis recalling that Emery was jealous and controlling of her, refusing to let her work more than a few days per month, obsessively calling her while she was on tour and recurrently accusing her of infidelity: &quot;Ralph accused me of being with everybody from guitar players to agents to producers to my hairdresser and believe it or not, to my brother and sister. Male or female, it made no difference.&quot; The couple resided in Ridgetop, Tennessee, for a time, before Emery had a home built for them in the Brentwood area. In 1964, after four years of marriage, Davis divorced Emery after finding he had been unfaithful to her and conceived a child with another woman.

Davis later married NRBQ bassist Joey Spampinato in 1987. The couple divorced in 1996.

===Vegetarianism===
Davis became a vegetarian in 1974, and remained so for the rest of her life. She chose to abstain from eating meat after performing at a benefit concert in Kenya, where the concert organizers had killed and roasted a goat for the artists&#x27; banquet. &quot;I really connected with that goat,&quot; she recounted, &quot;and I couldn&#x27;t bear to eat it.&quot; She declined to participate or allow her music to be used in several lucrative advertising campaigns for meat and meat-related products. Davis partly attributed her vegetarianism to her Christianity, as she felt killing animals for consumption was incongruent with her religious beliefs.

==Illness and death==
In August 1988, Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy of her right breast to treat the cancer and was in remission for several years before having a recurrence in 1996.

In 2001, Davis became incapacitated by her breast cancer, which had metastasized. The following year, she made her final performance at the Grand Ole Opry, performing &quot;The End of the World&quot;. She died of breast cancer in a Nashville, Tennessee, hospice on September 19, 2004, aged 72. She is interred at Williams Memorial Gardens in Franklin, Tennessee.

==Legacy==
Davis&#x27;s song &quot;The End of the World&quot; has been named as a major influence on several artists: Among them are Lou Reed, and 21st-century singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, both of whom named it among their favorite recordings of all time. Bob Dylan also recorded a version of &quot;I Forgot More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot; featuring the Davis Sisters&#x27; arrangements on his 1970 album &quot;Self Portrait&quot;. &quot;The End of the World&quot; was also used in the popular video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;.

Nina Gordon, formerly of Veruca Salt, also covered the song on her 2000 album &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot;.

Davis penned nearly 70 songs over the course of her career, and earned two BMI awards: for &quot;Set Him Free&quot; and &quot;My Last Date With You&quot;, the latter also recorded by Ann-Margret, Pat Boone, Kay Starr, Joni James, and several others, in addition to Davis&#x27; original hit version. Deborah Harry recorded a remake of Davis&#x27; version in 1993 featuring Michael Stipe, a long-time Davis fan. (Conway Twitty wrote new lyrics for the instrumental in 1972 as &quot;Lost Her Love (On Our Last Date)&quot;, which reached number one on the country chart, as did Emmylou Harris&#x27; remake of Twitty&#x27;s version in 1983 retitled &quot;Lost His Love (On Our Last Date)&quot;.)

<text>The WWE Cruiserweight Championship was a professional wrestling championship in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was originally a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) title. It was challenged by cruiserweights at a maximum weight of 225 lbs. During the WWE brand extension, it was the only title to be exclusive to the SmackDown! brand during its entire tenure. There were a total of 36 recognized champions who had a combined 34 official reigns. This is a chronological list of wrestlers that held the original WWE Cruiserweight Championship, listed by ring name, with the longest reign being 385 days by Gregory Helms (as well as being the only person to hold this championship for 365 days or more), and the most reigns by Rey Mysterio with 8.

After WCW was purchased by WWE, the inaugural champion was retroactively changed from Shinjiro Otani to Brian Pillman, as WWE recognizes the former WCW Light Heavyweight Championship as part of the original lineage of the Cruiserweight Championship.

His poem &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Hut&quot; (, 1947) is about the fight after unification of Belarus with the Soviet state. His trilogy &quot;At a Crossroads&quot; (, 1925) is about the pre-Revolutionary life of the Belarusian peasantry and the democratic intelligentsia. He was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946 and 1949.

<text>The Wohlen–Dietikon railway line is a railway line in Switzerland. It connects Wohlen and Bremgarten in the canton of Aargau with Dietikon in the canton of Zürich. Passenger service on the line now forms part of the Zürich S-Bahn, branded as the S17, and a frequent service is provided, with trains running up to every 15 minutes.

The line was opened in stages by the between 1876 and 1912. Whilst the earliest section to be opened, between Wohlen and Bremgarten, was built as a traditional standard gauge branch line, the later section between Bremgarten and Dietikon was built as rural electric tramway in metre gauge. Whilst much of the line has been upgraded, this is still apparent in the long stretches of roadside track, and stretches of street running in Dietikon.

Today the line is owned and operated by Aargau Verkehr AG (AVA), a company that operates other rail and bus services in the region.

==History==

===Wohlen-Bremgarten railway===
The route between &quot;Wohlen &quot;and&quot; Bremgarten West&quot; was built to standard gauge by the Aargauische Südbahn railway, which connected Aarau and Rotkreuz via Wohlen. The service began on 1 September 1876, operated by steam locomotives.

On 1 January 1902 Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) took over the Aargauische Südbahn. The SBB continued to operate the service as a steam operated standard gauge branch line.

===Bremgarten-Dietikon tramway===

The line to Wohlen had several disadvantages for Bremgarten. The timetable was poor, Bremgarten West station was too far away from the town centre, and the connection to Zürich initially proceeded in the wrong direction and was very indirect. In 1895 a plan was produced for a roadside electric tramway between Bremgarten and Dietikon. As Dietikon already had a direct rail link to Zürich, this provided a much more direct connection.

Construction began in 1901 and the route was opened on 30 April 1902. The new line crossed the Mutschellen pass between its two terminal points, was owned by the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn company (BD), and built to metre gauge. The line&#x27;s headquarters and terminus were at Bremgarten station, close to the town&#x27;s centre. Besides the connection to the main line railway at Dietikon, the line shared track in Dietikon with the Limmattal-Strassenbahn, which provided a link to the Zürich city tram system.

===Wohlen-Dietikon through service===

Despite the construction of the new line, there was still a gap of about a kilometre between Bremgarten and Bremgarten West where passengers had to make their own way. The BD entered into negotiations with the SBB, and in 1910, a permanent lease for the Wohlen-Bremgarten railway line was obtained.

The standard gauge line from Wohlen to Bremgarten West was converted to dual gauge (standard and metre), thus permitting standard gauge freight to continue to access Bremgarten West, and was electrified. A new terminus was constructed opposite the main line station in Wohlen. In Bremgarten, a new stretch of metre gauge line was constructed to connect the two stations, including an imposing railway bridge across the river Reuss. Through running between Wohlen and Dietikon began on 8 February 1912.

===Modernisation===

After 1950 the line was modernised to suburban railway standards using new rolling stock and facilities. In 1969, the line took delivery of 9 new articulated BDe 8/8 units, which were to be the mainstay of the line for the next 40 years.

The opening of the rapid-transit Zürich S-Bahn network on 27 May 1990 caused major development. The route and timetable were integrated into the rapid-transit railway network, and three new stops with interchange facilities with other public transport modes were added.

In 1993, the line&#x27;s rolling stock was augmented by 5 new Be 4/8 low-floor units. In 1995, a double-track section was built between &quot;Rudolfstetten Hofacker&quot; and &quot;Berikon-Widen&quot;, which was extended two years later to the &quot; Belveder&quot; stop.

===BDWM Transport===
In 2000, the BD company merged with the company (WM) to form BDWM Transport. Despite its name and by the time of the merger, the WM company was a bus operator, and BDWM Transport operated a number of bus services in addition to the Bremgarten–Dietikon line.

In 2010, the BDWM took delivery of the first of 14 new ABe 4/8 articulated low floor units, intended to replace all the previous units. The 40-year-old BDe 8/8 units were, with the exception of the preservation of a single unit, scrapped. The 17-year-old Be 4/8 units were sold to the Wynental and Suhrental Railway.

===End of the standard gauge===
The last standard gauge freight train operated to Bremgarten in 2009, although occasional standard gauge passenger trains aimed at the rail enthusiast market have run since. When track renewal was due in 2015, the decision was made to relay the line as meter gauge only. The end of the standard gauge was marked with special trains on June 26–28, and in July service between Bremgarten West and Wohlen was suspended for a number of days for the removal of the standard gauge track and renewal of the meter gauge track.

===Aargau Verkehr===
In June 2018, BDWM Transport merged with the Wynental and Suhrental Railway to form Aargau Verkehr AG (AVA), the company which now owns and operates the Bremgarten–Dietikon line.

==Operation==
===Route===
The line begins in Wohlen at a platform opposite the SBB Wohlen station at an altitude of . The line climbs to an altitude of and passes into the Bremgarterwald &quot;(Bremgarten Forest)&quot;. The Erdmannlistein stop lies in the middle in the forest and serves exclusively trip traffic. After 6.6 km, the Bremgarten West station is reached. This was originally the terminus of the old standard gauge branch railway whose route has been followed since Wohlen, and thus far the line is rather flat (maximum gradient of 1.5%), has gentle turning radii (minimum ) and resembles a normal SBB standard gauge line. After Bremgarten West, the line changes its character completely, adopting the sharper curves and steeper gradients of a narrow gauge line.

After negotiating two sharp curves out of Bremgarten West station, the line runs along the bridge over the Reuss. The company&#x27;s headquarters, including a depot and administration building, are located at Bremgarten station at an altitude of . From here on the line runs alongside the main road through a more densely populated, although still rural, area. A series of exceptionally tight U-shaped curves takes the line uphill, at slopes of up to 5.6%, to Berikon-Widen station on the Mutschellen pass at an altitude of . From here the line drops through equally tortuous curves to Rudolfstetten Hofacker, where the downward gradient becomes gradually flatter. From Bergfrieden station the line has tramway-like characteristics with street-running. The line ends at Dietikon station at a platform beside the SBB tracks and at an altitude of .

===Infrastructure===

The line is long, of which is double track and the rest single track. It has a minimum curve radius of , and a maximum gradient of 5.6%. A section of length in Dietikon runs in the street, sharing its road space with other traffic. The line is equipped with metre gauge ( gauge) track throughout, and is electrified at 1200 V DC, using an overhead line.

===Services===

The passenger services on the line now forms part of the Zürich S-Bahn, branded as the S17. A service of two trains per hour is provided every day between Wohlen and Dietikon. Except on Sundays and public holidays, an extra two trains per hour are provided between Bremgarten West and Dietikon. Apart from a small number of additional peak-hour express trains, all trains serve all stops, taking just over 30 minutes for the full length of the line.

=== Rolling stock ===
The line uses the following rolling stock:

==Future==
There is a light rail system in the densely populated Limmattal area, west of Zürich, which connects to the Bremgarten–Dietikon in Dietikon. To the west of Dietikon the line link to Spreitenbach and Killwangen, whilst to the east it would run through Urdorf and Schlieren to Zürich-Altstetten railway station, with connection to the Zürich tram route 2 (Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich). A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by BDWM. Construction was scheduled to start in late 2017, with a planned opening in 2022.

The Limmattal light rail line shares tracks with the Bremgarten–Dietikon line, from the latter&#x27;s terminus at Dietikon station to the intersection of Bremgartnerstrasse and Zentralstrasse. The common section of on-street track, which is currently single track, is doubled.

<doc id="1002417" wikidata="Q5222782" url="?curid=1002417" title="Darin Morgan">
<text>Darin Morgan (born 1966) is an American screenwriter best known for several offbeat, darkly humorous episodes of the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot;. His teleplay for the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; won a 1996 Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. In 2015, Morgan wrote and directed one episode for &quot;The X-Files&quot; season ten, and returned again in 2017 to write and direct another episode for season eleven. He is the younger brother of writer and director Glen Morgan.

==Writing career==
Morgan was born in Syracuse, New York, and studied in the film program at Loyola Marymount University, where he co-wrote a six-minute short film that led to a three-picture deal with TriStar Pictures. Morgan subsequently wrote a number of unproduced screenplays and appeared in two small guest roles on &quot;The Commish&quot; and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, where his brother Glen was a writer. Joel Silver hired Morgan to write the second intended &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot; film after &quot;Demon Knight&quot;, called &quot;Dead Easy&quot; (aka &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;) a New Orleans zombie romp. However the script was rejected by producers Gilbert Adler and A. L. Katz.

===&quot;The X-Files&quot;===
In 1994, Morgan was cast as the Flukeman, a mutated flukeworm the size of a human being, in &quot;The Host&quot;, a second-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, where his brother, Glen, worked as a writer and producer. The episode originally aired on September 23, 1994. The role required Morgan to wear a cumbersome rubber suit for twenty hours at a stretch, an experience he described as &quot;terrible, just horrible.&quot; Subsequently, he worked with his brother in developing the story for the next episode, &quot;Blood&quot; (aired September 30, 1994), for which he received story credit.

At the suggestion of producer Howard Gordon shortly thereafter, Morgan became a full-time staff writer for &quot;The X-Files&quot;, where he wrote his first episode, &quot;Humbug&quot; (originally aired on March 31, 1995). A quirky, funny, sometimes gruesome story about a series of murders in a colony of circus freaks, &quot;Humbug&quot; is considered a landmark episode in the history of &quot;The X-Files&quot; for broadening the dark tone and style of the series and taking it into funnier, less predictable directions. It was nominated for a 1996 Edgar Award.

Morgan&#x27;s next episode, &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot;, originally aired on October 13, 1995. &quot;Clyde Bruckman&quot; remains a favorite of fans and critics alike, and was acclaimed for retaining the humorous spirit of &quot;Humbug&quot; while extending its story into darker, more poignant territory. Both Morgan and actor Peter Boyle, who played the titular depressed psychic Clyde Bruckman, won Emmy Awards for this episode. The Bruckman character in that episode was named after a real person, also named Clyde Bruckman, who was a comedy director and writer who had worked with Buster Keaton, Monty Banks, W. C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, and Harold Lloyd among others.

Morgan wrote two additional episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in the 1990s: the absurdist cockroach invasion story &quot;War of the Coprophages&quot; (originally aired on January 5, 1996) and &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; (April 12, 1996). He also contributed to a rewrite of the episode &quot;Quagmire&quot; (May 3, 1996), although he was uncredited for his contributions at the time. He left the show after its third season, but joined the writing staff of &quot;Millennium&quot;, writing and directing two episodes with layered plots and humorous dialogue: &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot;&quot; (originally aired on November 21, 1997) and &quot;Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me&quot; (May 1, 1998).

In a March 2015 interview, Chris Carter revealed that Morgan would write an episode for the show&#x27;s then-announced tenth season. The episode, entitled &quot;Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster&quot; aired on February 1, 2016. Morgan worked on the show&#x27;s eleventh season, contributing the script for the episode &quot;The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat&quot; (aired on January 24, 2018 ).

In addition to his work as a writer, Morgan appeared in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; (April 20, 1997), playing Eddie Van Blundht, a self-described &quot;loser&quot; with the ability to shape-shift.

===Later work===
On August 11, 2004, it was announced that Morgan and screenwriter Sam Hamm were writing an untitled screenplay under development by DreamWorks SKG. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the story &quot;concerns a marriage counselor, whose daughter is about to get married, who discovers that his future son-in-law is suffering from the delusion that he&#x27;s a superhero.&quot;

Morgan worked on the second episode of former &quot;X-Files&quot; producer Frank Spotnitz&#x27;s &quot;&quot; remake, as consulting producer, though the show was canceled before any of Morgan&#x27;s scripts were produced. The only script that Morgan wrote before the show was canceled was called &quot;The M Word&quot;. It concerned a serial killer and a were-lizard, who may or may not be one and the same. It is available as a PDF on the second disc of the show&#x27;s DVD set. The script was later rewritten for the tenth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; as &quot;Mulder And Scully Meet The Were-Monster.&quot;

Morgan worked as a consulting producer on the short-lived TV reboot of &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; (2008) and &quot;Fringe&quot; (2008). He subsequently joined his brother Glen&#x27;s productions of &quot;Tower Prep&quot; (2010) and &quot;Intruders&quot; (2014) as a supervising producer, writing multiple episodes of each show.

In 2015, Morgan wrote and directed one episode for &quot;The X-Files&quot; season ten titled &quot;Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster&quot;, and then returned again in 2017 to write and direct &quot;The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat&quot; for season eleven.

<text>Davies is a patronymic Welsh surname meaning &quot;son of David&quot;. It is the second most common surname in Wales, a rank it shares with &quot;Williams&quot;, and the eighth most common surname in England, where many people have Welsh ancestry. It is particularly widespread in southwest England, especially Cornwall, and in the areas of northwest England that are near the border with Wales.

In the United States, the variant &quot;Davis&quot; is much more common. In the United Kingdom, the surname is usually pronounced the same as &quot;Davis&quot;. This pronunciation is also used by many other English-speaking countries, though it sometimes competes with the common American pronunciation to distinguish it from &quot;Davis&quot;.

There are two main theories concerning the surname&#x27;s origin, though neither have been proven. The first theory states that it may stem from the Kingdom of Dyfed, a medieval Welsh kingdom located in modern-day Carmarthenshire; however, the origin of the kingdom&#x27;s name is itself disputed, with the most commonly accepted theories being that it was founded by the powerful Irish &quot;Déisi&quot; dynasty in the third century or that it otherwise derives from the name of the Demetae people. &quot;Dyfed&quot; as a surname and the related forename &quot;Dafydd&quot; appear from the 12th century, with the latter generally translated into English as &quot;David&quot;. The second theory about the origin of &quot;Davies&quot; contends that it may derive directly from the Hebrew name &quot;David&quot;, which is also the name of Wales&#x27; patron saint.

<doc id="1002424" wikidata="Q1105754" url="?curid=1002424" title="Code page 850">
<text>Code page 850 (CCSID 850) (also known as CP 850, IBM 00850, OEM 850, DOS Latin 1) is a code page used under DOS operating systems in Western Europe. Depending on the country setting and system configuration, code page 850 is the primary code page and default OEM code page in many countries, including various English-speaking locales (e.g. in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada), whilst other English-speaking locales (like the United States) default to the hardware code page 437.

Code page 850 differs from code page 437 in that many of the box-drawing characters, Greek letters, and various symbols were replaced with additional Latin letters with diacritics, thus greatly improving support for Western European languages (all characters from ISO 8859-1 are included). At the same time, the changes frequently caused display glitches with programs that made use of the box-drawing characters to display a GUI-like surface in text mode.

After the DOS era, successor operating systems largely replaced code page 850 with Windows-1252, later UCS-2 and UTF-16, and finally UTF-8. However, legacy applications, especially command-line programs, may still depend on support for older code pages.

==Character set==
Each non-ASCII character appears with its equivalent Unicode code-point. Differences from code page 437 are limited to the second half of the table, the first half being the same.


==Code page 858==

In 1998, code page 858 (CCSID 858) (also known as CP 858, IBM 00858, OEM 858) was derived from this code page by changing code point 213 (D5hex) from a dotless i to the euro sign . Unlike most code pages modified to support the euro sign, the generic currency sign at CFhex was not chosen as the character to replace (compare ISO-8859-15 (from ISO-8859-1), code pages 808 (from 866), 848 (from 1125), 849 (from 1131) and 872 (from 855), ISO-IR-205 (from ISO-8859-4), ISO-IR-206 (from ISO-8859-13), and the changes to MacRoman and MacCyrillic).

Instead of adding support for the new code page 858, IBM&#x27;s PC DOS 2000, also released in 1998, changed the definition of the existing code page 850 to what IBM called &quot;modified code page 850&quot; to include the euro sign at code point 213. The reason for this might have been due to restrictions in MS-DOS/PC DOS, which limited .CPI files to 64 KB in size or about six codepages maximum. Adding support for codepage 858 might have meant to drop another (e.g. codepage 850) at the same time, which might not have been a viable solution at that time, given that some applications were hard-wired to use codepage 850. More recent IBM/MS products implemented codepage 858 under its own ID.

<text>Luke Carey Ford (born 28 May 1966) is an Australian/American writer, blogger, and former pornography gossip columnist.

==Personal life==
Ford moved to California in 1977. His father, Desmond Ford, was a noted Seventh-day Adventist theologian, and was the centre of a theological controversy in the late 1970s and &#x27;80s. His mother, Gwen Ford, published a book when he was two years old, but died of bone cancer in March 1970, when Ford was three.

After leaving the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Ford explored atheism. Ford states that he was converted to Judaism through a Los Angeles Beis Din. Ford says he observes the Jewish Sabbath, attends synagogue regularly, and keeps kosher. He has been asked to leave at least two different congregations. Ford wrote about his religious ostracism in &quot;XXX-Communicated: A Rebel Without a Shul&quot;.

Ford claims to have been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.

==Professional==
Ford studied economics at UCLA but did not graduate. Instead, he worked as an investigative journalist for southern California newspapers and at a radio station. In 1995, he became intrigued with the lack of journalistic coverage of the pornography industry, and started to write a book, which became &quot;A History of X&quot;.

In January 1996, after researching porn for a year, Ford wrote, produced, directed and acted in &quot;What Women Want&quot;, a pornographic video. It was not a success. Ford is credited as &quot;Dick Dundee&quot;.

In 1997, Ford started his pornography gossip website, LukeFord.com. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a businessman. I&#x27;m not a conventional journalist. I&#x27;m a story teller/entertainer/lunatic.&quot;

Ford was sued for defamation multiple times by people in the porn industry, including by RJB Telecom, whom he (as well as the Federal Trade Commission) accused of dishonesty; Christi Lake, whom he mislabeled in a bestiality photo; and Laurie Holmes (widow of John Holmes), for accusations of prostitution on the set. Ford has said that he has been sued five times to date: one suit was dropped, another was thrown out, another was settled when his insurance company paid $100,000, and the last two were settled when he removed some of his statements without making a retraction. In 2001, &quot;Wired&quot; called him &quot;The Most Hated Man in Web Porn&quot;. In 2001, he was physically assaulted by Mike Albo, an editor for &quot;Hustler&quot;.

In August 2001, after urgings of his rabbi, Ford sold his main website, lukeford.com to Netvideogirls.com for $25,000, and created lukeford.net which avoided pornography, and focused more on Jewish issues. One year later, after nearly going broke, he returned to his pornographic roots by starting lukeisback.com with many of his old archives. 

In October 2007, Ford announced he had sold lukeisback.com and its contents for an undisclosed sum to an undisclosed party. &quot;Any writing I do on the porn industry from now on will be for publications with no porn advertising,&quot; Ford said. Those owners, whose names have not been divulged, ran the site until June 2008 but walked away from the site saying that writing the site was too much work for the money earned. In 2008, it was sold a second time, with the new owner being long-time industry observer Cindy Loftus.

In 2007, &quot;AVN&quot; Hall of Famer Bill Margold said that &quot;Luke Ford is exactly what we deserve... Luke&#x27;s not really a blogger as much as is an internet journalist&quot;. Ford was also in the 2012 documentary &quot;After Porn Ends&quot;, which is about life after being a porn actor.

It was burrowed through the tuff stone of Monte Grillo by the architect Lucius Cocceius Auctus at the command of Agrippa who was in the process of converting the Lake into a military port, the &quot;Portus Julius&quot;.

The tunnel was wide enough to allow the passage of two wagons. The Avernus side of the passage was decorated with a colonnade and had many statues in niches hewn into the tuff walls of the entrance. Light and air were provided by six vertical shafts dug into the hill (the longest of which was over thirty metres high)

The Aqua Augusta aqueduct supplying the port was dug in a tunnel parallel to and on the northern side the road and was also equipped with niches and vertical shafts.

The Crypta Romana tunnel was also built nearby from Cumae to its port in the same period, as well as other tunnels in the vicinity (e.g. the Crypta Neapolitana).

With the end of the civil war between Octavian and Mark Antony in 31 BC and the displacement of the fleet from Portus Julius to the port of Misenum in 12 BC, the tunnels lost their strategic interest, but continued to be useful for practical and commercial reasons.

The tunnel is also known as the , in reference to a Spanish captain, Pietro de Pace, who made use of the tunnel in 1508–1509 to plunder the ruins of Cumae, which, at the time, still bore many rich items.

The Grotta was heavily damaged during World War II and is no longer open to the public.

It has undergone extensive restoration works in recent years (up to 2017) and should be reopened in the near future. However, colonies of five species of legally-protected bats were discovered during the restoration, making an environmental assessment necessary before the reopening can go through.

<text>James William Ross (born January 3, 1952) is an American professional wrestling commentator, sports announcer, podcaster, better known by the ring name Jim Ross (often shortened to JR). He is signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he serves as a commentator as well as an analyst and senior advisor. Ross is best known for a long and distinguished career as a play-by-play commentator for WWE. Known affectionately by WWE fans as &quot;Good Ol&#x27; JR&quot;, Ross has been labeled as the greatest wrestling commentator of all time. Ross, while in WWE, was occasionally involved in storylines and also participated in nine wrestling matches from 1999 to 2011. 

After years of working various jobs in the professional wrestling industry, Ross became the primary play-by-play announcer for Mid-South Wrestling in the early 1980s. He went on to do commentary for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling territory, before jumping to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), making his first appearance for the promotion at WrestleMania IX in 1993. During his tenure with WWF/WWE, Ross was widely regarded as the voice of the company, particularly during the Attitude Era of the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was also the lead English-language announcer for New Japan Pro-Wrestling on AXS TV from 2015 to 2018 and has occasionally done play-by-play for boxing and mixed martial arts fights. He has been inducted into the WWE, NWA and &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; halls of fame, and has been honored by the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame twice.

Outside of wrestling, Ross is known for his barbecue sauce and beef jerky brand, J.R.&#x27;s Family BBQ. He also hosts his own weekly podcast, &quot;Grilling JR&quot;.

==Early life==
James William Ross was born on January 3, 1952, in Fort Bragg, California. He is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. His family came to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. He sold his great-great-grandfather&#x27;s original land allotment from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 2022.

His maternal grandparents owned a general store in Westville, Oklahoma, and his paternal grandfather, Dee Ross, owned an off-sale beer store and was a carpenter. While attending Westville High School, Ross played first base on the Westville baseball team. Ross was a two-time all-conference football player for the Westville Yellowjackets in 1968–69. Ross was also President of the Student Body, a 4-year letterman in basketball, and State Vice President of the Future Farmers of America (FFA). He was the FFA Oklahoma Speech Champion in 1968 and 1969 and runner up for the FFA National Speech Championship in 1969. He was awarded the FFA State Degree in 1970, the organization&#x27;s second highest award. He ran for and was elected vice president of the FFA Northeast District in 1970. Ross was also named Honorable Mention on the 1969 High School All-State Football team by the Tulsa World as a center.

In high school, Ross did well academically, reaching the National Honor Society his sophomore year. He received an award for maintaining a 3.6 grade point average his junior year. In 1969, Ross was nominated by Representative Wiley Sparkman to serve as a page for the Oklahoma House of Representatives. That year, Ross served as the treasurer for Oklahoma Boys State. For 18 years, Ross officiated high school and college baseball, football and basketball games in Oklahoma.

==Broadcasting career==
===Professional wrestling===
====NWA Tri-State/Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation (1974–1987)====
During his tenure at Northeastern State University, Ross had spent some time commentating on college radio. With this experience, Ross was given the opportunity to fill a broadcast position in the local NWA Tri-State territory, after an announcer was unable to appear at one of the territory&#x27;s events. After his arrival in the promotion, Ross first worked as a referee starting in 1974. Ross remained as a referee until 1977 when he then transitioned to the promotion&#x27;s broadcast team. After Bill Watts&#x27; purchase of NWA Tri-State in 1982 and the subsequent re-branding to Mid-South Wrestling (MSW), Ross was promoted to the promotion&#x27;s lead play-by-play position and also became Mid-South Vice President of Marketing. During this time, Ross was able to call his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship match which featured Ric Flair and Ted DiBiase.

====Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1987–1993)====
When Jim Crockett, Jr. bought the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) and merged it with his Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) group, Ross joined JCP and began doing color commentary alongside David Crockett and Tony Schiavone. With his new position, Ross became the head play-by-play man for the National Wrestling Alliance. Ross continued to hone his skills as JCP became World Championship Wrestling (WCW), following the purchase of the regional promotion by Ted Turner. In 1991, WCW left the NWA and Ross was teamed with former NWA broadcaster Bob Caudle. In 1992, he also spent one season as a commentator on the Atlanta Falcons radio broadcasts.

Ross worked his way up the WCW ladder to become head of broadcasting, but had a contentious relationship with WCW&#x27;s newest commentator and future executive Eric Bischoff. According to Ross, Bischoff, who reported to him, did a really good job of &quot;selling himself&quot; to executives of WCW&#x27;s owner Turner Broadcasting. According to Bischoff, Ross mistreated him and others (mostly in deference to Ross&#x27;s then-supervisor Bill Watts), and when Bischoff was promoted to executive producer in 1993, Ross demanded and received his release.

Ross had a three-year contract with Turner Broadcasting, but he took an immediate buy-out for fear that he would not get work elsewhere due to being taken off television for a long period of time. Mick Foley claims that Ross resigned from WCW&#x27;s booking committee. Ross left WCW after being taken off the air by Bischoff.

====World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE (1993–2013)====

Ross was hired by the World Wrestling Federation and made his on-screen debut at WrestleMania IX at a specially constructed outdoor venue at Caesar&#x27;s Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. He took over for Gorilla Monsoon on &quot;WWE Wrestling Challenge&quot; the following weekend. Ross worked alongside Bobby Heenan on the show until Heenan left the WWF in December 1993. Ross was originally the main voice of the WWF&#x27;s pay-per-view events when he was first brought in, calling both WrestleMania IX and the King of the Ring with Heenan and Randy Savage in 1993. Vince McMahon took over his position at pay-per-views starting with SummerSlam 1993.

Ross suggested the idea of Radio WWF to McMahon, the idea was given a try and Ross was made host alongside Monsoon. In this role, Ross was joined by co-hosts such as Johnny Polo, and talked to various WWF wrestlers and fans. Ross and Monsoon called SummerSlam and Survivor Series at the end of 1993 and the Royal Rumble for Radio WWF.

Ross was fired on February 11, 1994, two weeks after suffering his first attack of Bell&#x27;s palsy on January 30, 1994, as stated by Ross on the September 23, 1996, episode of Raw. He subsequently became an announcer for Smoky Mountain Wrestling and the National Football League&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons (the second time he was with the Falcons as an announcer). In Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Ross was reunited with former NWA/WCW announcer Bob Caudle. The promotion was owned by longtime NWA Manager Jim Cornette and featured many former NWA/WCW wrestlers such as The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express, Eddie Gilbert, and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams.

When the United States v. McMahon court case was ongoing, Vince McMahon was unable to continue commentating on &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot;. After a few weeks of Gorilla Monsoon on play-by-play, the WWF rehired Ross to fill in for McMahon alongside Randy Savage throughout that summer. After McMahon was acquitted, Ross was let go by the WWF for purportedly leaking inside information to journalists. Ross briefly returned to Smoky Mountain Wrestling.

The WWF rehired Ross once again in December 1994. Relegated to the syndicated WWF programming for the majority of the next two years, Ross rejoined the primary announce team in the summer of 1996. In September 1996, Ross turned heel in WWF storylines for the first time in his career. Following Scott Hall and Kevin Nash&#x27;s departure from the WWF for WCW and their debut there as The Outsiders, Ross began to proclaim on television that he was still in touch with Razor Ramon and Diesel (Hall and Nash&#x27;s WWF personas, respectively) and claimed that he would be bringing them back to the WWF soon. Other announcers were skeptical, and WWF President Gorilla Monsoon said that Hall and Nash were under contract with &quot;another organization&quot;, and ordered Ross to cease and desist mentioning them on the air. On the September 23, 1996, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Ross delivered a worked-shoot promo during which he ran down WWF Chairman Vince McMahon (outing him as chairman and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines) and debuted his &quot;new&quot; Diesel and Razor, claiming that while working in the WWF &quot;front office&quot; he had been the man responsible for so many people leaving the company as part of his &quot;revenge&quot; against the WWF for how they treated him in the past. While he was kept on the air by McMahon, Ross portrayed himself to be bitter and spiteful, with repeated potshots at McMahon. However, the &quot;New Diesel-New Razor&quot; storyline was poorly received by fans, and Ross&#x27;s heel turn was quickly dropped.
After this angle, Ross went on to host various WWF programs such as &quot;Superstars&quot;, &quot;Action Zone&quot;, &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, and &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. At the end of 1998, Ross took a break from &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, due to another attack of Bell&#x27;s Palsy he suffered whilst broadcasting a PPV (Capital Carnage) in London, England. Earlier in the day Ross had been informed his mother had died. On March 8, 1999, he returned to &quot;Raw Is War&quot; as part of a storyline alleging that McMahon fired him because of his condition, but that he would not go down quietly and enlisted the services of &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams as his personal &quot;enforcer&quot;. Ross confronted his replacement, Michael Cole, in the ring. Despite Cole&#x27;s insistence that he was not trying to steal Ross&#x27;s job, Ross kicked Cole in the crotch and attempted to return to the announce table, though Terry Taylor ended up commentating for the rest of the night. The narrative went as far as to have Ross set up his own announce table in front of the official announce table labeled &quot;JR Is Raw&quot;. The storyline was soon dropped as the attempt to turn Ross heel failed (the fans ended up cheering Ross and booing Cole) and he took his seat back as &quot;official&quot; commentator of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; starting with the main event of WrestleMania XV. Ross&#x27;s Bell&#x27;s palsy proved fodder for ridicule by WWF&#x27;s competitor, WCW, in late 1999. Ed Ferrara parodied Ross, including doing a full impression including mockery of his modified voice due to his medical condition. This was received negatively by fans and wrestlers alike. Ferrara ceased mocking the medical condition after the first week due to Turner Standards and Practices stepping in and overriding Vince Russo. The angle was soon dropped by WCW, but not before &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, Ferrara&#x27;s parody of Ross, won the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Though Ross was offended over the gimmick, he doesn&#x27;t fault Ferrara himself over the gimmick and Ross and Ferrara have since patched things up over the angle.

During this time, Ross was commissioned to announce regional telecasts of the XFL, a professional football league co-owned by WWF. Ross, who had experience announcing for the Atlanta Falcons, was initially placed on the regional broadcasts, with his WWF partner Jerry Lawler as color commentator, even though Lawler admitted knowing and caring little about the sport, for the first regional telecast. After an incident in which the head play-by-play man on the national broadcast team, Matt Vasgersian, openly criticized the production on-air, Ross was hastily promoted to lead play-by-play, with Jesse Ventura as color commentator, for the next four weeks of broadcasts. Ross returned to the regional telecasts halfway through the XFL&#x27;s Longhorns lone season, with Dick Butkus as his color commentator after Lawler left the company.

Ross was the &quot;voice of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;&quot; throughout the Monday Night War alongside Jerry Lawler and cemented his legacy as one of the great wrestling commentators as WWE became the sole major wrestling promotion in North America. After the WWE brand extension, Ross worked exclusively for the Raw brand, cutting down to doing play-by-play on &quot;Raw&quot;-only pay-per-views, while SmackDown!-only pay-per-views were announced by SmackDown!&#x27;s announce team.
Ross was involved in a lengthy feud with Eric Bischoff over Bischoff&#x27;s mistreatment of Stone Cold Steve Austin. Also during this time, Ross served as an Executive Vice President of Talent Relations for the WWF/WWE, a codified extension of his long-time backstage role as a key individual in charge of hiring new talent. By 2005, Ross had stepped down from his executive and management roles. According to repeated statements on his official blog, the move away from management proved beneficial in terms of decreased work-load, giving him more time to focus on his health, his family, and his entrepreneurial endeavors.

Still working as the voice of &quot;Raw&quot;, Ross was again &quot;fired&quot; (kayfabe) from his play-by-play job by Vince and Linda McMahon on October 10, 2005. Doctors had discovered a serious issue with Ross&#x27;s colon, and his storyline termination provided an explanation for his absence. While recovering from his colon surgery, Joey Styles (best known for his commentary work for Extreme Championship Wrestling) called the weekly &quot;Raw&quot;. After recovering, Ross helped produce the &quot;Raw&quot; announcers from backstage, and was brought back for &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot; in 2006, then the Raw-brand matches at WrestleMania 22 and Backlash before taking back his play-by-play job on &quot;Raw&quot; on May 8, 2006, after Styles quit &quot;Raw&quot; in the storyline, declaring his hatred for &quot;sports entertainment&quot;.

Ross&#x27;s contract with WWE expired in October 2006. At that point, neither side had signed a new contract and instead worked week to week under the terms of the expired contract. In November 2006, Ross stated on his official blog that he had signed a new one-year contract with WWE and would continue to work year-to-year.

On March 31, 2007, Ross was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2007 by Steve Austin.

On June 23, 2008, during the 2008 WWE draft, Ross was drafted from Raw to the SmackDown brand while Michael Cole was drafted from SmackDown to Raw, trading positions as commentators on each brand. This ended Ross&#x27;s position as &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;″s play-by-play commentator after a nearly 12-year run. The following day Ross posted a blog on his official website saying initially he was not happy with the move and considered quitting the company since he was not told beforehand about the move, but that he would work &quot;to make SmackDown the best program the WWE produces&quot;.

On September 23, 2008, episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot;, Ross made an appearance on the ECW brand filling in for a sick Todd Grisham alongside Matt Striker.
On April 8, 2009, Ross announced on his WWE Universe blog that with the departure of Tazz from World Wrestling Entertainment, he would assume the role of &quot;SmackDown&quot;&#x27;s color analyst, with ECW announcer Todd Grisham moving over to the brand as the play-by-play announcer. The Hell in a Cell PPV event on October 4, 2009, was his last PPV broadcast as a full-time announcer for WWE and the &quot;SmackDown&quot; tapings on October 6, 2009 was the final televised broadcast as the full-time announcer.

Ross missed the &quot;SmackDown&quot; tapings on October 13, 2009, as he asked for a day off due to an anniversary. Seven days later, on October 20, Ross suffered his third Bell&#x27;s palsy episode en route to Columbia, South Carolina, for a &quot;SmackDown&quot; taping. After initially planning on working the tapings and reuniting with Lawler, Ross instead flew back to Oklahoma, missing the show—Lawler and Cole commentated &quot;SmackDown&quot;—and leaving his plans for Bragging Rights in the air. On October 21, 2009, Jim Ross announced that he would not be commentating the Bragging Rights pay-per-view, but Grisham mentioned that SmackDown would give Ross the Bragging Rights trophy as a &quot;get well&quot; gift.

On the November 15, 2010 &quot;Old School Raw&quot; special, Ross made a guest appearance on commentary with Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole, calling a match between Daniel Bryan and Jack Swagger. Cole insulted Ross throughout the match, which resulted in Ross hitting Cole over the head with his hat after the match had finished. Ross returned on March 14, 2011, to confront Cole, who had entered into a feud with Lawler. After being insulted by Cole, he challenged him to a match but was attacked by Swagger. Ross called the final four matches at WrestleMania XXVII, including the Cole vs Lawler match. On the post-WrestleMania &quot;Raw&quot;, Ross joined commentary, only to walk out later in the night after Cole squirted him with barbecue sauce. Ross and Lawler defeated Cole and Swagger on the April 11 and 25 episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; but were defeated by Cole and Swagger in a Country Whipping match at Extreme Rules. As Lawler&#x27;s feud with Cole ended at Over the Limit, Ross showed up to gain revenge on Cole by squirting him with barbecue sauce.

On July 25, 2011, the new COO of WWE, Triple H re-hired Ross to a full-time commentating position on &quot;Raw&quot;. The new Raw Interim General Manager, John Laurinaitis, fired Ross on October 10 for walking out on Triple H a week earlier. Ross later revealed that he was given no prior notice that he was to be publicly fired. Ross returned on October 17, joining John Cena to defeat Michael Cole and Alberto Del Rio in a tag match. A week later, Cole challenged Ross to a &quot;Michael Cole Challenge&quot;, with Ross&#x27;s job on the line. The challenge took place on November 14; Ross won two of the three challenges, the first being an arm wrestling contest, and the second being a dance off, but lost the final challenge, which was who weighed less. Even though he lost the contest, he called the opening match of the night after Michael Cole was attacked by CM Punk.

At WrestleMania XXVIII, he returned to call the &#x27;End of an Era&#x27; Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and The Undertaker. Prior to the start of the match, Ross shook hands with Michael Cole, effectively healing any old wounds they had between them. Ross also made an appearance at &quot;Raw 1000&quot;, commentating the opening match. On June 20, 2012, Ross took over as a commentator on the revamped &quot;NXT&quot; alongside Byron Saxton and William Regal. Also during 2012, after Paul Levesque (Triple H) took control of Talent Relations he hired Jim Ross to work as an Adviser and Scout within the department. Following Jerry Lawler&#x27;s heart attack on September 10, 2012, Ross returned to &quot;Raw&quot; to work as an interim commentator while Lawler recovered. Ross was honored on the October 1 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; as it was dedicated &quot;JR Appreciation Night&quot; and was held in his hometown of Oklahoma City. While CM Punk interrupted the segment as it aired, Ross was acknowledged by Vince McMahon and Triple H as well as local wrestling legends Bill Watts and Danny Hodge after &quot;Raw&quot; went off the air. Ross also served as presenter for the Match of the Year award at the 2012 Slammy Awards.

In 2013, Ross began to coach and produce new announcers at the WWE Performance Center in Florida. He returned to television on the 20th Anniversary edition of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 14, 2013, where he called the steel cage main event between John Cena and Dolph Ziggler. On March 1, 2013, he appeared on &quot;WWE Smackdown&quot; to interview his long-time friend Jack Swagger, and Swagger&#x27;s new advocate, Zeb Colter. During the segment, Swagger turned against Ross, ending their friendship.

On August 16, 2013, while hosting a &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; roster announcement panel with guests, Ross was suspected of being intoxicated. He used profanity during several points and appeared to have little to no interest in the topics that were scheduled to be covered. He also put down one of the sponsors of the event and allowed Ric Flair, who was a member of the guest panel and was also suspected of being intoxicated, to share a slew of off-color remarks and stories, among them being a description of John Cena as a &quot;hardcore drinker&quot;. On September 11, 2013, Ross officially announced his &quot;retirement&quot; from WWE as his contract had expired and was not to be renewed, however it was suspected that he was fired due to his actions at the roster announcement. In an interview in 2014, Ross claimed that an insult to the sponsor of the event was what led to his release. In the same interview he confirmed that he was not drunk, but rather fatigued due to Bell&#x27;s palsy which was likely the reason he may have been perceived as being intoxicated. McMahon addressed the situation in a December 2014 interview, claiming that while he disapproved of Ross&#x27;s behavior at the event, it was ultimately Ross&#x27;s decision to leave WWE as he wanted to spend more time at home than working for WWE. McMahon stated that there is no heat between the two parties.

====New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2015–2018)====
On January 4, 2015, Ross and Matt Striker served as the English language commentators for Global Force Wrestling&#x27;s presentation of New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome pay-per-view.

On January 19, 2016, it was announced that Ross had signed to become the new lead announcer for NJPW&#x27;s weekly program on AXS TV along with Josh Barnett. Ross&#x27;s contract was directly with AXS TV and not NJPW. It was revealed in November 2018 that Barnett and Ross would no longer be doing NJPW commentary. In 2019 the New Japan World commentary team took over broadcasting the AXS shows until the contract ended in December of that year.

====Independent circuit (2016–2019)====
On October 8, 2016, Ross, along with Jim Cornette, provided commentary for What Culture Pro Wrestling&#x27;s (WCPW) first iPPV, Refuse to Lose. On December 31, Ross was on commentary for the pilot episode of &quot;World of Sport Wrestling&quot; on ITV. On February 12, 2017, Ross returned to WCPW for commentary at the iPPV, True Destiny and for WCPW&#x27;s &quot;Loaded&quot; tapings that same month.

====Return to WWE (2017–2019)====
On April 2, 2017, at WrestleMania 33, Ross returned to WWE, providing commentary for the main event No Holds Barred match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns. Shortly after the event, it was announced that Ross had signed a two-year deal with the company. During the summer, Ross would provide commentary, alongside Lita, for the Mae Young Classic. On the January 22, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot;, Ross would reunite with Jerry Lawler as part of the commentary team that was at the Manhattan Center in which Ross was caught by several cameras sleeping. On April 8, 2018, at WrestleMania 34, Ross called the fifth annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on the WrestleMania 34 pre-show, alongside Jerry Lawler and Byron Saxton. Ross&#x27;s last televised appearance for WWE was part of the pre-show panel for the Greatest Royal Rumble on April 27, 2018.

Ross left WWE on March 27, 2019, after electing not to renew his contract. Ross stated that the reason for his WWE departure was because, &quot;I had two bookings in 2018 and they weren&#x27;t using me very much&quot;. Ross also attributed that another factor in his departure was Ross stating himself that, &quot;I still think I can do play-by-play even though others that may surround Vince think I can&#x27;t &quot;. In August 2019, Ross later revealed what he said to Vince McMahon before he left, stating &quot;Vince, unlike you I still believe I can do it and there are other people who believe I can do it including some of your audience&quot;.

====All Elite Wrestling (2019–present)====

On April 3, 2019, it was announced that Ross had signed a three-year deal with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a commentator and senior advisor. Ross initially provided full-time commentary on the broadcast team on &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; and occasionally part-time commentary on &quot;AEW Rampage&quot;. On the January 5, 2022, episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Ross returned to TBS for the first time since 1993. In June 2022, Ross switched from full-time commentary on &quot;Dynamite&quot; to full-time commentary on &quot;Rampage&quot; in a commentary team rotation swap with Taz.

On June 17, 2023, Ross tweeted an image showing a black eye he had suffered due to a fall, he worked at the debut episode of &quot;AEW Collision&quot; but later announced that he would be stepping away to heal.

On August 5, 2023, Ross returned to the &quot;AEW Collision&quot; commentary team, and has since only provided commentary as an analyst for the main events in the second hour of AEW Collision.

Following his further surgery in February 2024, Ross returned on March 3, 2024, for Revolution to commentate Sting&#x27;s retirement match. In August 2024 he recorded separate sit-down interviews with Bryan Danielson and Swerve Strickland ahead of their match at All In. Later that month he revealed he had broken his wrist although he expected to call the match at All In. On August 25, 2024, Ross commentated during the main event between Danielson and Strickland at All In. He also returned on September 7, 2024, for the All Out main event and unsanctioned matches.

===National Football League===
In 1992, Ross joined the Atlanta Falcons radio broadcast team. However, he would leave after one season, but had a second stint with the Falcons in 1994.

===Boxing and mixed martial arts===
Ross made his debut calling boxing on May 26, 2014, for Golden Boy Promotions on Fox Sports 1.

Ross teamed up with MMA fighter and UFC veteran Chael Sonnen to commentate the Battlegrounds MMA one night tournament PPV on October 3, 2014.

===Podcasting===
In 2014 Ross began hosting his own podcast &quot;The Ross Report&quot; for PodcastOne. It was later relaunched as part of the Westwood One podcast network in 2018 as &quot;The Jim Ross Report&quot;. In April 2019, Ross partnered with wrestling podcaster/mortgage lender Conrad Thompson to revamp his podcast as &quot;Grilling JR&quot;, with a new format of reminiscences about Ross&#x27;s history in wrestling, much in the same style as Thompson&#x27;s podcasts with Bruce Prichard, Eric Bischoff, Tony Schiavone, 
Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett and Arn Anderson.

==In-ring career==
Although Ross&#x27;s career has predominantly been as a commentator, Ross has participated in matches, with some notable success, including a victory over Triple H in a no-disqualification match in 2005 (albeit with help from Batista).

Another notable in-ring appearance by Ross was in a tag team match with broadcast partner Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler against Al Snow and Jonathan Coachman at the 2003 Unforgiven pay-per-view, with their Raw broadcast jobs on the line. They lost the contest to Snow and Coachman due to interference by Chris Jericho, however two weeks later Ross and Lawler regained their jobs when Ross defeated Coachman in a Country Whippin&#x27; match, using a stunner as a finishing maneuver. Ross has participated in more matches alongside Lawler, including a few with hardcore stipulations. In 2011, Ross competed against Michael Cole on the April 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he defeated Cole by disqualification after Cole&#x27;s manager for the match, Jack Swagger, attacked Ross while he had Cole mounted and was landing punches on him.

Ross has been involved in numerous other conflicts with other competitors as well such as Triple H, Val Venis, Jack Swagger, Vladimir Kozlov, Mankind, and Steve Austin, Ross has been bloodied in a match by then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, and was even set on fire by Kane. Ross even main-evented the WWF&#x27;s first-ever show from the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, an episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; that took place on October 11, 1999. Ross teamed with Steve Austin to take on WWF Champion Triple H and his partner Chyna.

As part of storylines, Ross has been regularly targeted by Vince McMahon in rather harsh circumstances throughout his time with WWE: most notably in 2005 when Vince McMahon&#x27;s character, Mr. McMahon, featured in a series of segments which made fun of Ross&#x27;s legitimate colon surgery.

In 2011, after his firing as an announcer by John Laurinaitis, he returned to team up with John Cena to face Michael Cole and Alberto Del Rio in a tag team match on &quot;Raw&quot; in a winning effort.

==Personal life==
Ric Flair claims he introduced Ross to his late wife, Jan. Ross writes in his autobiography that Ric Flair was present on an airplane when he first met Jan who was a flight attendant. He has two daughters from two previous marriages and two granddaughters. He cites Steve Austin and Jerry Lawler as his closest friends.
Ross lives with Bell&#x27;s palsy, which sometimes temporarily paralyzes his facial muscles. The symptoms first occurred on January 30, 1994. In late 1998, following the death of his mother, Ross took a break from &quot;WWE Raw&quot; as the effects of his grief reportedly aggravated his palsy; Michael Cole filled in for him.

In 2007, encouraged by sales of his line of barbecue sauces and beef products, Ross opened up J.R.&#x27;s Family Bar-B-Q in Norman, Oklahoma. The restaurant closed in May 2010. Ross is also a fan of Skyline Chili and has mentioned them in connection to Cincinnati numerous times on AEW programming.

Ross is an avid Oklahoma Sooners fan and a regular football season ticket holder. This is reflected in his entrance music, which is &quot;Boomer Sooner&quot; (the Sooners&#x27; fight song). He can be spotted at some Sooners home games, and when the Sooners play top teams around the country. In 2014, he became FoxSports.com&#x27;s Contributor for NCAA Football and Oklahoma Sooners. On the February 23, 2021, episode of his YouTube series &quot;Grilling J.R.&quot;, Ross stated that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is his favorite TV show and that he still would occasionally watch it.

On March 21, 2017, Ross&#x27;s wife Jan was involved in a vehicle accident, suffering serious head injuries. She was put on life support, and she died two days later.

Ross had an eye operation in 2018 that greatly affected his eyesight in one eye.

On October 23, 2021, Ross tweeted that he had skin cancer as he was on his way to &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;. On December 29, 2021, Ross tweeted that he was cancer free. On February 1, 2024, Ross once again tweeted that he had undergone successful cancer surgery on his right hip.

==In other media==
In the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, Ross played Lance Russell (Memphis weekly wrestling show&#x27;s lead announcer) announcing the match between Andy Kaufman (played by Jim Carrey) and Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler.

Ross also has a recurring role on the Amazon Prime Video original &quot;Paradise City&quot; as Ned.

Ross was one of the original lead announcers of the original XFL in spring 2001.

Ross has also provided his voice for many WWE video games, and is also an unlockable character in &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;, &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot;, &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot; and many more.

In October 2014, he appeared in &quot;Brian and the Boz&quot;, a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary on fellow Oklahoman Brian Bosworth. Three years later, he appeared in another &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary, this time about Ric Flair.

Ross has written two WWF/WWE themed cook books &quot;Can You Take The Heat? The WWF Is Cooking&quot; and &quot;J.R&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; released in 2000 and 2003 respectively. 
His autobiography &quot;Slobberknocker&quot; was released on October 3, 2017. The foreword for the new autobiography was written by Vince McMahon. The book includes a letter from McMahon to Ross from when Ross was sick for the second time with Bell&#x27;s Palsy. 
Ross&#x27;s second book and further autobiography &quot;Under the Black Hat: My Life in the WWE and Beyond&quot;, co-written with Paul O&#x27;Brien, was published in March 2020. On May 7, 2024, Ross and O&#x27;Brien released a second book, &quot;Business Is About to Pick Up!.&quot;

Ross has also created a range of J.R.&#x27;s BBQ sauces and mustard which have been inspired by his own culinary knowledge and that of his close family.

==Legacy==
Ross has been labeled as the greatest wrestling commentator of all time. Ryan Dilbert from the Bleacher Report has stated &quot;Ross also brought searing passion and a love of the wrestling business to Mid-South Wrestling, WWE and World Championship Wrestling. To hear a match with Ross on the call was to watch wrestling morph into poetry, for the scripted action to feel real, meaningful and unforgettable. Debating the greatest pro wrestling commentator comes down to two men, Ross and Gordon Solie. As for the greatest in WWE history, there is no debate Ross stands alone&quot;.

Professional wrestling booker and promoter and colleague, Eric Bischoff, has praised and been critical of Ross, stating, &quot;Jim was in upper-management, had a lot of influence, was participating in the booking during WCW&#x27;s worst days, and he still didn&#x27;t have management of the company. So I&#x27;m not saying he wasn&#x27;t capable, necessarily. But he certainly didn&#x27;t have a track record that he could point to and say look, this is what I did over here.&quot; Bischoff also further reiterated that Ross, &quot;worked very closely with Bill Watts, which is one of the biggest train wrecks in the history of professional wrestling. So it&#x27;s not like Jim came in with a résumé that would make one think he would be the ideal candidate to run a wrestling company. Jim is the best announcer, probably on planet Earth. Jim had a tremendous amount of experience and had seen a lot, but he&#x27;d never done it.&quot;

WWE Hall of Famer and Legend Stone Cold Steve Austin has praised Ross stating, &quot;Jim Ross, to me, with his range, with his storytelling, he paid his dues. I mean, he learned from the ground up. And his inflection and his ability to watch a match, tell a story, get the talent over with the credibility that he had, he was the shining diamond on top of everyone, so always a good experience with Jim&quot;.

<text>&quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; is a show tune from the 1927 musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, who wrote the song in 1925. The song contrasts the struggles and hardships of African Americans with the endless, uncaring flow of the Mississippi River. It is sung from the point of view of a black stevedore on a showboat, and is the most famous song from the show. The song is meant to be performed in a slow tempo; it is sung complete once in the musical&#x27;s lengthy first scene by the stevedore &quot;Joe&quot; who travels with the boat, and, in the stage version, is heard four more times in brief reprises. Joe serves as a sort of musical one-man Greek chorus, and the song, when reprised, comments on the action, as if saying, &quot;This has happened, but the river keeps rolling on anyway.&quot;

The song is notable for several aspects: the lyrical pentatonic-scale melody, the subjects of toil and social class, the metaphor to the Mississippi, and as a bass solo (rare in musicals, solos for baritones or tenors being more common).

Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra had a hit recording of the song in early 1928, in a much faster tempo than Kern and Hammerstein intended, featuring Bing Crosby on vocals and Bix Beiderbecke on cornet. A second version was recorded on March 1, with Paul Whiteman and his Concert Orchestra and bass singer Paul Robeson on vocals, sung in a dance tempo. The latter was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006, and a 1936 rendition by Robeson also finished No. 24 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs 2004 survey of top tunes in American cinema. Its musical composition entered the public domain on January 1, 2023.

==Early versions==
The song was first performed in the original stage production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; on December 27, 1927, by Jules Bledsoe, who also sang it in the part-talkie 1929 film, although that film version had little to do with the stage musical. Bledsoe also recorded the song years later. However, the most famous rendition of it, one that is still noted today, was sung by Paul Robeson in James Whale&#x27;s classic 1936 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. The role of Joe in the musical was originally written with Robeson in mind, but Robeson declined the role in the 1927 production due to scheduling conflict. Robeson, however, accepted the role for its 1928 London production and 1932 Broadway revival. He also performed the song three times in the show instead of the one originally written. 

The first known recording of the song was by &quot;Kenn&quot; Sisson and His Orchestra, recorded on December 27, 1927, with Irving Kaufman on vocals. Robeson recorded the song with Paul Whiteman and his Concert Orchestra in 1928, and multiple times in the 1930s.

From the show&#x27;s opening number &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot;, the notes in the phrase &quot;Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom&quot; are the same notes as those in the phrase &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River, dat Ol&#x27; Man River,&quot; but inverted. However, &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; was written first, and &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; was written only after Kern and Hammerstein realized they needed a song to end the first scene in the show. Hammerstein decided to use the idea of the Mississippi River as a basis for the song and told Kern to use the melody that the stevedores sang in &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; but invert some of it, and slow down the tempo. This inversion gave &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; a tragic quality.

==Robeson&#x27;s alterations to song lyrics==
Beginning about 1938 to the end of his career, Paul Robeson changed a few of the lyrics of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; when singing it at recitals but never in actual stage performances of &quot;Show Boat&quot; and not in the 1936 film version. (In addition to the 1928 and 1932 stage productions as well as the 1936 film version, he appeared in a Los Angeles stage revival in 1940.) Except for the change of the word &quot;niggers&quot; to &quot;darkies&quot;, the lyrics of the song as Robeson performed it in the 1936 film version of the show remain exactly as Oscar Hammerstein II originally wrote them in 1927. However, after 1938, Robeson would record the song only with the lyrics that he had used in his post-1936 concert recitals.

In the 1978 one-man play &quot;Paul Robeson&quot;, by Phillip Hayes Dean, there is a (perhaps fictitious) reference to the change in the lyrics - an unseen interviewer asks Robeson (played by James Earl Jones) about the original lyrics, and he responds &quot;No, I don&#x27;t sing it that way anymore&quot;.

In the 1951 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, as well as the 1962 studio recording and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival of the show, William Warfield sang only the introductory verse and the lyrics to the main section of the song, and omitted what could be considered a controversial section, in contrast to both Jules Bledsoe (who sang it in the prologue to the 1929 film version) and Robeson (who sang the whole song in the 1936 film). The section that Warfield omitted begins:

::&quot;Niggers all work on de Mississippi,&quot;
::&quot;Niggers all work while de white folks play&quot;...

In the 1936 film, the word &quot;niggers&quot; was changed to &quot;darkies&quot;. Ever since the 1946 revival, the term has been changed to &quot;colored folks&quot;, although there have been revivals that change the lines to &quot;Here we all work on de Mississippi,/ Here we all work while de white folks play&quot;. Al Jolson sang a version starting with &quot;lots of folks work on the Mississippi.&quot; Also, the phrase &quot;feared of dyin&#x27; &quot; (rather than &quot;skeered of dyin&#x27; &quot;) has been sung in some recordings, notably Lawrence Tibbett&#x27;s 1930s version, Gordon MacRae&#x27;s 1950s version (first heard on &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot;), and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1946 performance, first heard in the film &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;.

Robeson&#x27;s own 1938 changes in the lyrics of the song are as follows:

* Instead of &quot;Dere&#x27;s an ol&#x27; man called de Mississippi, / Dat&#x27;s de ol&#x27; man that I&#x27;d like to be...&quot;, Robeson sang &quot;There&#x27;s an ol&#x27; man called the Mississippi, / That&#x27;s the ol&#x27; man I don&#x27;t like to be&quot;...&quot;
* Instead of &quot;Tote that barge! / Lift that bale! / Git a little drunk, / An&#x27; you land in jail...&quot;, Robeson sang &quot;Tote that barge and lift dat bale!/ You show a little grit / And you lands in jail..&quot;
* Instead of &quot;Ah gits weary / An&#x27; sick of tryin&#x27;; / Ah&#x27;m tired of livin&#x27; / An skeered of dyin&#x27;, / But Ol&#x27; Man River, / He jes&#x27; keeps rolling along!&quot;, Robeson sang &quot;But I keeps laffin&#x27;/ Instead of cryin&#x27; / I must keep fightin&#x27;; / Until I&#x27;m dyin&#x27;, / And Ol&#x27; Man River, / He&#x27;ll just keep rollin&#x27; along!&quot; In Scene 7 of Act II of the show, Joe does sing this verse, but rather than singing &quot;I must keep fightin&#x27; until I&#x27;m dyin&quot;, sings &quot;I must keep livin&#x27; until I&#x27;m dyin,/ But Ol&#x27; Man River,/ He jes&#x27; keeps rollin&#x27; along!&quot; According to the 1988 EMI album of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, these are Hammerstein&#x27;s authentic lyrics for this reprise.

In recitals and in several of his many recordings of the song, Robeson also omitted the controversial section &quot;Niggers all work on de Mississippi...&quot;, etc., with its middle portion &quot;Don&#x27;t look up/ An&#x27; don&#x27;t look down/ You don&#x27;t dast make / De white boss frown&quot;, etc., as well as its concluding &quot;Lemme go &#x27; way from de Mississippi/ Lemme go &#x27; way from de white man boss, etc.&quot; . However, Robeson did include a portion of these lyrics in the 1932 4-record 78 rpm album of selections from &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

Gordon MacRae&#x27;s version of the song, as performed on &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; radio program (late 1940s or 1950s), changed the phrase &quot;white man boss&quot; to &quot;big man boss&quot;.

The Temptations, in their rendition on &quot;The Temptations in a Mellow Mood&quot; (1967), changed any references to the &quot;white man boss&quot; to &quot;rich man boss&quot;, as well as &quot;Here we all work while the white boys play&quot; to &quot;Here we all work while the rich boys play&quot;.

In 1988, EMI/Angel Records issued a 3-CD set of the complete score of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, starring Frederica Von Stade, Jerry Hadley, Teresa Stratas, and Bruce Hubbard, conducted by John McGlinn. On this album, the original 1927 lyrics of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; were heard for the first time on a high fidelity stereo recording.

While Robeson&#x27;s changes to the lyrics were mostly sung by himself, Leon and Eric Bibb together sang a changed version in their 2006 tribute album &quot;Praising Peace: A Tribute to Paul Robeson&quot;, and a clip exists of William Warfield singing the song with the changes that Robeson incorporated into it.

==Other versions==
Indian singer Bhupen Hazarika met Robeson in New York in the 1950s. His Assamese song &quot;Bistirno Dupare&quot; is influenced by &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, with the Brahmaputra replacing the Mississippi. Hazarika&#x27;s song has in turn been translated into Bengali (with the same name) and Hindi (as &quot;Ganga Behti Ho Kyu&quot;, about the Ganges).

The Beach Boys recorded a version of Ol&#x27; Man River with &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; as an instrumental intro during the recording sessions for their 1968 20/20 album, which didn&#x27;t make the final cut.

<text>Tigranocerta (, &quot;Tigranόkerta&quot;; Tigranakert; ), also called Cholimma or Chlomaron in antiquity, was a city and the capital of the Armenian Kingdom between 77 and 69 BCE. It bore the name of Tigranes the Great, who founded the city in the first century BC. There is so far no common agreement on the precise location of Tigranakert; it was either near present-day Silvan, Arzan (Arzn, in the Armenian province of Arzanene or Aghdznik), east of Diyarbakır, Turkey, or in the valley of the Garzan river mentioned by T. A. Sinclair. It was one of four cities in historic Armenia named Tigranakert. The others were in Nakhichevan, Artsakh and Utik, the 4 cities being in the old Armenian provinces Aldznik, Goghtn, Utik, Artsakh.

== History ==
To create this city, Tigranes forced many people out of their homes to make up the population. Armenia at this time had expanded east to the Caspian Sea, west to central Cappadocia, and south towards Judea, advancing as far as the regions surrounding what is now the Krak des Chevaliers.

The city&#x27;s markets were filled with traders and merchants doing business from all over the ancient world. Tigranocerta quickly became a very important commercial, as well as cultural center of the Near East. The magnificent theater that was established by the Great King, of which he was an avid devotee, conducted dramas and comedies mostly played by Greek as well as Armenian actors. Plutarch wrote that Tigranocerta was &quot;a rich and beautiful city where every common man and every man of rank studied to adorn it&quot;. The Hellenistic culture during the Artaxiad dynasty had a strong influence and the Greek language was in fact the official language of the court. Tigranes had divided Greater Armenia – the nucleus of the Empire – into four major strategic regions or viceroyalties.

A Roman force under Lucius Licinius Lucullus defeated Tigranes at the Battle of Tigranocerta nearby in 69 BC, and afterwards sacked the city, sending many of the people back to their original homes.

After the plunder, which included the destruction of statues and temples, the city was set ablaze. An abundant quantity of gold and silver was carried off to Rome as war booty. Lucullus took most of the gold and silver from the melted-down statues, pots, cups and other valuable metals and precious stones. During the pillage most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants fled to the countryside. The newly established theater building was also destroyed in the fire. The great city would never recover from this devastating destruction.

During Pompey the Great&#x27;s &#x27;conquests of the east&#x27;, Tigranocerta was retaken briefly by Rome, but was lost when Tigranes the Great was given parts of his kingdom back after his initial surrender to Pompey for the cost of 6,000 talents (an indemnity paid to Rome over an uncertain period). It was again taken by the Romans under Corbulo, during the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63.

During late antiquity Tigranokert was commonly referred to as Chlomaron, which was either another name or the name of a more significant settlement near the ancient one. In 587 during the reign of emperor Maurice, Chlomaron and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the Battle of the Blarathon.

During the Ottoman period, Armenians referred to the city of Diyarbekir as Dikranagerd (Western Armenian pronunciation of Tigranakert).

<doc id="1002468" wikidata="Q607195" url="?curid=1002468" title="Aleksandr Baryatinsky">
<text>Prince Aleksandr Ivanovich Baryatinsky (, tr. ; – 9 March 1879) was a Russian General and Field Marshal (from 1859), Prince, governor of the Caucasus.

== Early life and background ==

He was born into the aristocratic Baryatinsky family, a scion of the Rurik dynasty, on 14 May 1815 in Ivanovsky village of Lgovsky district in Kursk Governorate. His father, Prince Ivan Ivanovich Baryatinsky (1767-1825), son of Princess Catherine of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, was one of the wealthiest people in Russia, having inherited numerous estates and about 35,000 serfs. 

His mother was Countess Marie Wilhelmine von Keller (1792-1858), daughter of a Bavarian diplomat, Count Dorotheus Ludwig &quot;Christoph&quot; von Keller (1757-1827) and his younger German wife, Countess Amalie Luise of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Ludwigsburg (1771-1853), younger sister of the Russian field marshal Peter Wittgenstein.

== Education and career ==
He was the eldest son and received an excellent education at home. His father died in 1825, when Alexander was merely 10 years old. His mother took him along with his second son Vladimir to Moscow for &quot;improvement in the sciences&quot; in 1829. The upbringing of both brothers was carried out by an Englishman - Thomas Evans, a well-known teacher at that time, who taught young men &quot;classics and literature.&quot;

Baryatinsky entered the school of the ensigns of the Guard in his seventeenth year and, on 8 November 1833, received his commission of cornet in the Life Guards of the future Tsar Alexander II. In 1835, he served with great gallantry in the Caucasus, and on his return to St.Petersburg was rewarded with a golden sword for valour. On 1 January 1836, he was attached to the suite of Alexander, and in 1845 was again ordered off to the Caucasus and again most brilliantly distinguished himself, especially in the attack on Shamil&#x27;s stronghold, for which he received the Order of St. George. In 1846, he assisted Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich to suppress the Kraków Uprising. From 1848 to 1856 he took a leading part in all the chief military events in the Caucasus, his most notable exploits being his victory at Mezeninsk in 1850 and his operations against Shamil in Chechnya.

His energetic and at the same time systematic tactics inaugurated a new era of mountain warfare. On 6 January 1853, he was appointed adjutant general and, on 5 July of the same year, chief of staff. In 1854, he took part in the brilliant Kurbsk Dere campaign. On 1 January 1856, he became commander-in-chief of the Caucasian army, and, subsequently, viceroy of the Caucasus. Within three years of his appointment, the whole of the eastern Caucasus was subdued and the long elusive Shamil was taken captive. Baryatinsky also conquered many of the tribes of the western Caucasus dwelling between the rivers of Laba and Belaya.

== Final years and death ==

By the early 1860s, Baryatinsky&#x27;s health had seriously deteriorated and he resigned from his position due to gout. During this period, Baryatinsky&#x27;s life was marked by scandal because of his years-long romantic attachment to the Georgian Princess Elisabeth Orbeliani (1833-1899), granddaughter of Vakhtang Orbeliani, who was still married to Colonel Vladimir Davydov (1816-1886) (son of Alexander Lvovich Davydov). Baryatinsky ended up challenging Davydov to a duel and then &quot;induced&quot; him to divorce Elizabeth so that he could marry her himself. Baryatinsky&#x27;s union with Elizabeth ultimately received the blessing of Emperor Alexander II and was concluded in 1862.

After his marriage, Prince Baryatinsky lived abroad for a long time. He criticized the military reforms carried out by Dmitry Milyutin (formerly his chief of staff in the Caucasus). The mouthpiece of the conservative circles Rostislav Fadeev, was a protégé of Baryatinsky. By publishing a detailed account of the history of the Caucasian War, Fadeev hoped to draw public attention to the person of the retired field marshal in order to prepare his return to the political scene.

Subsequently, Baryatinsky made several attempts to return to the service, but he was tactfully denied this. In 1871 he was enlisted in Imperial cuirassier regiment and was appointed chief of the 2nd rifle battalion. The German emperor also honored Baryatinsky&#x27;s merits by appointing him chief of the 14th hussar regiment of the German army. At the beginning of the Russo-Turkish war, it was expected that the emperor would appoint Baryatinsky as commander-in-chief, but the sovereign entrusted this post to his brother. He spent the last days of his life abroad and died of heart disease in Geneva, after forty-eight years of active service.

== Political views ==
In the 1860s, Baryatinsky&#x27;s views shifted towards Slavophilism, more precisely, Pan-Slavism. When, in 1866, Prussia unleashed the Austro-Prussian War, Baryatinsky offered the Russian government an alliance with Prussia in order to divide the Austrian Empire: the Slavic lands were to go to Russia, the German lands to Prussia, and Hungary to become independent. But a special secret committee under the emperor rejected this plan. He saw halting of British advance in Asia as a matter of urgency. He is also remembered for overseeing and advocating the expulsion and genocide of the Circassians.

<doc id="1002473" wikidata="Q183130" url="?curid=1002473" title="Gastritis">
<text>Gastritis is the inflammation of the lining of the stomach. It may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration. There may be no symptoms but, when symptoms are present, the most common is upper abdominal pain (see dyspepsia). Other possible symptoms include nausea and vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and heartburn. Complications may include stomach bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors. When due to autoimmune problems, low red blood cells due to not enough vitamin B12 may occur, a condition known as pernicious anemia.
Common causes include infection with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot; this is now termed &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; induced gastritis, and included as a listed disease in ICD11. Less common causes include alcohol, smoking, cocaine, severe illness, autoimmune problems, radiation therapy and Crohn&#x27;s disease. Endoscopy, a type of X-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series, blood tests, and stool tests may help with diagnosis. Other conditions with similar symptoms include inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, and peptic ulcer disease.
Prevention is by avoiding things that cause the disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If &quot;H. pylori&quot; is present it may be treated with a combination of antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin. For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.
Gastritis is believed to affect about half of people worldwide. In 2013 there were approximately 90 million new cases of the condition. As people get older the disease becomes more common. It, along with a similar condition in the first part of the intestines known as duodenitis, resulted in 50,000 deaths in 2015. &quot;H. pylori&quot; was first discovered in 1981 by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Many people with gastritis experience no symptoms at all. However, upper central abdominal pain is the most common symptom; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp. Pain is usually located in the upper central portion of the abdomen, but it may occur anywhere from the upper left portion of the abdomen around to the back.

Other signs and symptoms may include the following:
* Nausea
* Vomiting (may be clear, green or yellow, blood-streaked or completely bloody depending on the severity of the stomach inflammation)
* Belching (does not usually relieve stomach pain if present)
* Bloating
* Early satiety
* Loss of appetite

== Causes ==
There are two categories of gastritis depending on the cause of the disease. There is erosive gastritis, for which the common causes are stress, alcohol, some drugs, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and Crohn&#x27;s disease. And, there is non-erosive gastritis, for which the most common cause is a &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection. 

===&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;===
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; colonizes the stomachs of more than half of the world&#x27;s population, and the infection continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals and, in a subset of patients, chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, stomach cancers, and some distinct extragastric disorders). Gastritis caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is termed &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; induced gastritis, and listed as a disease in ICD11. More than 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.

===Critical illness===
Gastritis may also develop after major surgery or traumatic injury (&quot;Cushing ulcer&quot;), burns (&quot;Curling ulcer&quot;), or severe infections. Gastritis may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract.

===Diet===
Evidence does not support a role for specific foods, including spicy foods and coffee, in the development of peptic ulcers. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them. There is little specific advice on diet published by authoritative sources. The National Health Service of the United Kingdom advises avoiding spicy, acidic or fried foods which may irritate the stomach.

== Pathophysiology ==

===Acute===

Acute erosive gastritis typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase-1, or COX-1, an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids in the stomach, which increases the possibility of peptic ulcers forming. Also, NSAIDs, such as aspirin, reduce a substance that protects the stomach called prostaglandin. These drugs used in a short period are not typically dangerous. However, regular use can lead to gastritis. Additionally, severe physiologic stress from sepsis, hypoxia, trauma, or surgery is also a common etiology for acute erosive gastritis, resulting in &quot;stress ulcers&quot;. This form of gastritis can occur in more than 5% of hospitalized patients.

Also, alcohol consumption does not cause chronic gastritis. It does, however, erode the mucosal lining of the stomach; low doses of alcohol stimulate hydrochloric acid secretion. High doses of alcohol do not stimulate secretion of acid.

===Chronic===
Chronic gastritis refers to a wide range of problems of the gastric issues. The immune system makes proteins and antibodies that fight infections in the body to maintain a homeostatic condition. In some disorders the body targets the stomach as if it were a foreign protein or pathogen; it makes antibodies against, severely damages, and may even destroy the stomach or its lining. In some cases bile, normally used to aid digestion in the small intestine, will enter through the pyloric valve of the stomach if it has been removed during surgery or does not work properly, also leading to gastritis. Gastritis may also be caused by other medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Crohn&#x27;s disease, certain connective tissue disorders, and liver or kidney failure. Since 1992, chronic gastritis lesions are classified according to the Sydney system.

====Metaplasia====
Mucous gland metaplasia, the reversible replacement of differentiated cells, occurs in the setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away (atrophic gastritis) and are progressively replaced by mucous glands. Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences. Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.

== Diagnosis ==

Often, a diagnosis can be made based on patients&#x27; description of their symptoms. Other methods which may be used to verify gastritis include:
* Blood tests:
** Blood cell count
** Presence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;
** Liver, kidney, gallbladder, or pancreas functions
* Urinalysis
* Stool sample, to look for blood in the stool
* X-rays
* Endoscopy, to check for stomach lining inflammation and mucous erosion
* Stomach biopsy, to test for gastritis and other conditions

The OLGA staging frame of chronic gastritis on histopathology. Atrophy is scored as the percentage of atrophic glands and scored on a four-tiered scale. No atrophy (0%) = score 0; mild atrophy (1–30%) = score 1; moderate atrophy (31–60%) = score 2; severe atrophy (&gt;60%) = score 3. These scores (0–3) are used in the OLGA staging assessment in each 10 compartment:
==Treatment==
Antacids are a common treatment for mild to medium gastritis. When antacids do not provide enough relief, medications such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help reduce the amount of acid are often prescribed.

Cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. They include the medications sucralfate and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate.

Several regimens are used to treat &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. Most use a combination of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. Sometimes bismuth is added to the regimen.

==History==
In 1,000 A.D, Avicenna first gave the description of stomach cancer. In 1728, German physician Georg Ernst Stahl first coined the term &quot;gastritis&quot;. Italian anatomical pathologist Giovanni Battista Morgagni further described the characteristics of gastric inflammation. He described the characteristics of erosive or ulcerative gastritis and erosive gastritis. Between 1808 and 1831, French physician François-Joseph-Victor Broussais gathered information from the autopsies of dead French soldiers. He described chronic gastritis as &quot;Gastritide&quot; and erroneously believed that gastritis was the cause of ascites, typhoid fever, and meningitis. In 1854, Charles Handfield Jones and Wilson Fox described the microscopic changes of stomach inner lining in gastritis which existed in diffuse and segmental forms. In 1855, Baron Carl von Rokitansky first described hypertrophic gastritis. In 1859, British physician, William Brinton first described about acute, subacute, and chronic gastritis. In 1870, Samuel Fenwick noted that pernicious anemia causes glandular atrophy in gastritis. German surgeon Georg Ernst Konjetzny noticed that both gastric ulcer and gastric cancer are the results of gastric inflammation. Shields Warren and Willam A. Meissner described the intestinal metaplasia of the stomach as a feature of chronic gastritis.

<text>Ratingen () is a town in the district of Mettmann in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It lies in the northwestern part of Berg about 12 km northeast of Düsseldorf.

==Administration==
With a communal reform of 1975 the independent municipalities of Breitscheid, Eggerscheidt, Hösel, Lintorf (seat Angerland) as well as the local part of Homberg and the municipality of Homberg-Meiersberg (seat Hubbelrath) were added to the city of Ratingen.
==History==
Ratingen was settled before 849. From the Middle Ages the Ratingen area belonged to the count and later dukes of Berg. On December 11, 1276 the settlement received city rights. Ratingen was one of the four places of Berg which experienced an economic boom in the end of the Middle Ages, but slowed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. At the beginning of the Industrial Age, the first manufacturing plants opened in 1783. In Cromford the first mechanical spinnery of Europe opened, which grew into the &quot;Textilfabrik Cromford&quot;, now part of the &quot;Rheinisches Industriemuseum&quot; (Rhine Industry Museum). In the Napoleonic times, it became part of the city of Berg and in 1815, into the Kingdom of Prussia.

In the communal re-organization of 1929, Ratingen maintained its independence. After relatively small war damage, Ratingen in the 1960s and the 1970s experienced years of growth and development (West Ratingen with 20,000 inhabitants, developed in the late 1960s-1980s). In 1970, before further incorporations the number of inhabitants surpassed 50,000.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Ratingen is Klaus Konrad Pesch of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2014. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

<text>Fanny Adams (30 April 1859 – 24 August 1867) was an eight-year-old English girl who was murdered by a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, Frederick Baker, in Alton, Hampshire, in 1867. Her murder was extraordinarily brutal and caused a national outcry in the United Kingdom. Baker abducted Adams and took her into a hop garden near her home, where he killed and dismembered her; some parts of her body were never found. An investigation suggested that two small knives were used for the murder, but it was later ruled they would have been insufficient to carry out the crime and that another weapon must have been used.

==Background==
Fanny Adams (born 30 April 1859) and her family lived in Tanhouse Lane on the northern side of Alton, a market town in Hampshire. The 1861 census shows that Fanny lived with her father and five siblings. The family was locally rooted; George Adams and his wife Ann, believed to be Fanny&#x27;s grandparents, lived next door.

Fanny was described as a &quot;tall, comely and intelligent girl&quot;. She appeared older than her actual age of eight and was known locally for her lively and cheerful disposition. Her best friend, Minnie Warner, was the same age and lived next door in Tanhouse Lane. Alton was renowned for its plentiful supply of hops, which led to many breweries opening in the town and made hop picking an integral part of its economy until the mid-20th century. To the northern end of Tanhouse Lane lies Flood Meadow and the surrounding River Wey, which sometimes flooded the area in times of heavy rain. A large hop garden was next to the meadow.

==Murder==

Alton had previously seen no serious crime during the 19th century. The afternoon of 24 August 1867 was reported as fine, sunny and hot. Around this time, Fanny, her sister Lizzie and best friend Minnie asked Harriet Adams, the sisters&#x27; mother, if she could go out to the nearby Flood Meadow. Having no objections and being pleased for the girls to leave her while she was getting on with housework, Harriet agreed. Fanny and the local children had often played in Flood Meadow, owing to its proximity to Tanhouse Lane and the fact that there had been little crime in Alton within living memory. 

As the girls were walking towards Flood Meadow and into a hop garden, they met Frederick Baker, a 29-year-old solicitor&#x27;s clerk. He wore a frock coat, light-coloured trousers and a tall hat. Baker had moved from his former home in Guildford to work and live in Alton about twelve months previously. He was employed by solicitor Mr. Clements, whose office was situated on Alton High Street, opposite the Swan Hotel, a hostelry which Baker frequented.

Baker gave Minnie and Lizzie three halfpence to spend on sweets and Fanny another halfpenny. The girls had seen Baker before at church meetings and were thus unconcerned about taking money from him. Baker then watched the girls run up and down The Hollow (a lane leading to the nearby village of Shalden) as they played and ate the blackberries he had picked for them. An hour later, Lizzie and Minnie decided they had had enough and opted to go home. Baker then approached Fanny and asked her to accompany him to Shalden. Fanny refused, and it was then that Baker abducted her and carried her into the nearby hop garden.

Lizzie and Minnie ran back to Minnie&#x27;s mother, Martha Warner, on Tanhouse Lane. She ignored their story, so the girls played together, oblivious of Fanny&#x27;s abduction. It was not until 5:00 pm that they went home for dinner. Mrs. Gardner, who also lived on Tanhouse Lane, noticed Fanny&#x27;s absence and asked the girls her whereabouts. The children relayed what had occurred earlier in the day and told Mrs. Gardner that Baker had taken Fanny away. Mrs. Gardner then relayed the information to Fanny&#x27;s mother, Harriet, and the two women searched for her. They met with Baker after going only a short distance, near a gate separating the hop garden from Flood Meadow. 

According to the &quot;Hampshire Chronicle&quot;, Mrs. Gardner asked Baker what he had done with the child. Baker assured her that he often gave money to children to buy sweets. Mrs. Gardner replied, &quot;I have a great mind to give you in charge of the police,&quot; to which Baker told her she could do what she liked. Baker&#x27;s position in town as the solicitor&#x27;s clerk initially deflected any suspicions the two women had. Both returned to their homes, believing Fanny was still playing in one of the surrounding fields.

===Discovery===
Between 7:00 and 8:00 pm, Fanny had still not returned home, prompting Harriet and a group of neighbours to search for the missing child. As the evening was setting, the group began the search in The Hollow with no success. In the nearby hop garden, however, labourer Thomas Gates (a Crimean War veteran who partook in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade) found Fanny&#x27;s head stuck on two hop poles while he was tending to the crops.

Fanny&#x27;s ear had been severed from the head, which had two large cuts from mouth to ear across the temple. Further investigation discovered the remains of the child; the head, arms and legs were separated from the trunk. There were three incisions on the left side of the chest and a deep cut on the left arm, dividing her muscles. Fanny&#x27;s forearm was cut off at the elbow joint, and her left leg nearly severed at the hip joint, with her left foot cut off at the ankle point. Her right leg was torn from the trunk, and the whole contents of her pelvis and chest were completely removed. Five further incisions had been made on the liver. Her heart had been cut out, and her vagina was missing. Both of her eyes were cut out and found in the nearby River Wey.

Overwhelmed with grief, Harriet collapsed on her way to inform her husband, George, who was playing cricket at the time, so the word was sent instead. When George was told the details he returned home to take his loaded shotgun and set out to look for the culprit, but neighbours stopped him and instead sat with him through the night. The next day, hundreds of people visited the hop garden to help collect Fanny&#x27;s scattered remains. The police tried, unsuccessfully, to find the murder weapons, as they suspected that small knives were used to commit the crime. Likely, the crowd of searchers had inadvertently trampled any clues on the ground. They did, however, recover all of Fanny&#x27;s cut clothing scattered around the field, except for her hat.

Most of Fanny&#x27;s body parts were collected that day, but an arm, foot and intestines were not found until the next morning. One foot was still in a shoe, and still clutched in one hand were the two halfpence that Baker had given to Fanny. The breast bone was never found. Fanny&#x27;s remains were taken to the doctor&#x27;s surgery, located in Amery Street, for a post-mortem to be carried out. The surgery was later converted to a public house, &#x27;Ye Old Leathern Bottle&#x27;, and is now a private residence. There, Fanny&#x27;s body parts were sewn together. From there, Hampshire Constabulary officers took them to the local police station. A stone that still had flesh and hair sticking to it was handed to the police as evidence, as they thought it might be the murder weapon.

===Arrest of Frederick Baker===
That evening, Police Superintendent William Cheyney hurried from the police station to Flood Meadow, where he was met by several people, who then led him to the Leathern Bottle. Upon arrival, the proprietor of the house handed Cheyney a bundle labeled &quot;portions of a child&quot;, and, with the help of some of his officers, Cheyney organised a search to trace the missing body parts. Hearing that Baker had been seen with the children before Fanny&#x27;s disappearance, Cheyney retraced his steps through the town and located his place of work. Arriving at the solicitor&#x27;s office at 9:00 pm, he found Baker still at work, an hour later than usual. Baker protested, claiming his innocence despite being informed he was the only suspect. Cheyney had no alternative but to arrest Baker on suspicion of murder. By this time, a large and agitated crowd had gathered outside the solicitor&#x27;s office, forcing the police to smuggle Baker out the back door for fear that the mob would kill him.

When searched at the police station, Baker was found to have two unstained small knives. Spots of blood were observed on both wristbands of his shirt, and his trousers had been soaked to conceal the bloodstains. After being questioned about his appearance, Baker responded: &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t see a scratch or cut on my hands to account for the blood&quot;. Baker&#x27;s conduct during his interrogation was described as cool and collected. Sometime after the arrest, Cheyney backtracked to Baker&#x27;s desk in the solicitor&#x27;s office and discovered a diary among some legal papers. An entry had been made for Saturday, 24 August 1867, which recorded: &quot;Killed a young girl. It was fine and hot.&quot; 

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; reported that the hop garden had been cleared on 21 September, but nothing connected with the murder had been found. It also added that Baker remained completely unfazed by the killing and did not exhibit any symptoms of insanity or remorse. Further confusion was added when Baker stated that he was intoxicated after seeing the children; all evidence and witnesses rejected his claim. Baker was transferred to Winchester Prison on 19 October.

==Investigation==
Subsequent investigations from Hampshire Constabulary continued until October 1867. Around this time, a young boy whose parents lived close to the Adams family came forward as an eyewitness. The boy testified that he saw Baker emerge from the hop garden at about 2:00 pm on the day Fanny was murdered, with his hands and clothes saturated with blood. Baker then reportedly stooped down to the river and calmly wiped himself with a handkerchief, after which he put a small knife and another unidentified object in his jacket pocket. The boy had related this story to his mother then, but she had not told anyone until she spoke out in a pub two months later. The police searched the whole area for sixteen days, but no other weapons were found.

Cheyney requested an immediate forensic test in late October. All recovered clothing and the two knives taken from Baker at the time of his arrest were sent to Professor A.S. Taylor at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, where they received the most detailed tests possible for the period. After examining the items over the coming weeks, Taylor was able to confirm that the blood on the knives was human. One of the knives contained a small amount of coagulated blood, although none was on the handle. Under cross-examination, Taylor stated he would have expected more blood on the knives and signs of rust if they had been washed. The quantity of blood found, however, was surprisingly small. However, Taylor opined that an inexperienced person armed with a proper weapon could dismember a body in about half an hour — blood would still run but would not have spurted from the body. Further examination of Baker&#x27;s clothes uncovered small traces of diluted blood in some of his waistcoat, trousers and stockings. The wristbands of his shirt had been folded back, and diluted blood stained the folds. There was no sign of rape on the body.

Dr Lewis Leslie from Alton thought Fanny&#x27;s ultimate cause of death was probably by a blow to the head with a stone. Leslie speculated that a larger instrument had to have been used to cut the body and also added that dismemberment was achieved in less than an hour. Forensics indicated that cuts had been made when the body was still warm and that Fanny had not only been cut but also hacked and torn to pieces. The time it had taken Baker to cut the body into so many pieces most likely allowed him to choose his positioning so that he might not necessarily be covered in blood. The forensic staff in London concluded that the small knives found in Baker&#x27;s possession would not have been capable of severing parts of Fanny&#x27;s body, so another weapon must have been used.

Meanwhile, in Winchester Prison, Baker was talkative to the wardens, especially the chaplain. He still insisted that his conscience was clear concerning the murder and wondered who the guilty party was, hoping that &quot;he would be found.&quot; Baker ate and slept well, unlike in Alton&#x27;s prison, where he was reportedly disturbed in his sleep and physically shuddered at the sight of meat.

==Trial==
===Initial trials in Alton===
English law at the time required that in the case of sudden death, an immediate inquest had to be held under the jurisdiction of a coroner. In the case of Fanny Adams&#x27; inquest, Deputy County Coroner Robert Harfield was in charge of the proceedings, which were held at the Dukes Head Inn (later re-named the George) in Alton on 27 August 1867. Cheyney and acting Chief Constable Superintendent Everitt, who represented Hampshire Constabulary, were in attendance. Coincidentally, the pub where the initial trials were held was very close to the police station, which is now the site of a fire station.

The first to give evidence was Minnie Warner, who told the jury that Baker had given her money to run down The Hollow with Fanny and into a nearby field while he picked blackberries for them. She was unable to identify Baker but correctly described what he was wearing when he murdered Fanny. The next to testify was Fanny&#x27;s mother, Harriet, who recalled that she met Baker at the gate to the hop garden and that he was headed towards the road which led to Basingstoke. Minnie identified Baker as the man who gave her the pennies there. Baker contradicted Minnie then by saying, &quot;No, three halfpence.&quot; When Harriet asked him to give his name, Baker refused but told her where he could be found.

Mrs. Gardner, who had accompanied Harriet to search for the missing girl, gave evidence next. She was able to identify Baker and told the jury that he appeared to be very relaxed at the time she saw him. After asking him if he had seen the missing child and enquiring why he had given her money, Mrs. Gardner told Harriet that she should &quot;give him in charge to the police,&quot; adding, &quot;The reason why I speak so is that an old gentleman has been giving halfpence to the children for no good purpose, and I thought you were of the same sort.&quot; After being asked again about Fanny&#x27;s whereabouts, Baker said he had left her at the gate to play. The coroner asked Baker if he wanted to cross-question the witness, but he declined. The inquest concluded that Baker was responsible for the murder of Fanny Adams, and he was committed to Winchester gaol to await trial.

The trial took place at Winchester on 5 December. The defence contested Minnie&#x27;s identification of Baker and claimed the knives found were too small for the crime. They also argued insanity: Baker&#x27;s father had been violent, a cousin had been in asylums, his sister had died of a brain fever and he had attempted suicide after a love affair. The defence also argued that the diary entry was typical of the &quot;epileptic or formal way of entry&quot; that the defendant used and that the absence of a comma after the word &quot;killed&quot; did not render the entry a confession.

Justice Mellor invited the jury to consider a verdict of not responsible because of insanity, but they returned a guilty verdict after just fifteen minutes. On 24 December, Christmas Eve, Baker was hanged outside Winchester Prison. The crime had become notorious, and a crowd of 5,000 attended the execution. This was the last public execution held at that prison. Before his death, Baker wrote to the Adams family expressing his sorrow for what he had done &quot;in an unguarded hour&quot; and seeking their forgiveness. Following his execution, Baker&#x27;s death mask was made, and the following year, his full figure was placed as an exhibit in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s famous waxworks in London.
Fanny was buried in Alton cemetery. The headstone reads:
==Legacy==
In 1869, new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it and suggested it might be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. &quot;Fanny Adams&quot; became slang for mediocre mutton, stew, scarce leftovers and then anything worthless. &quot;Fanny&quot; was also slang for the large tins the mutton was delivered in, and by extension other mess tins or cooking pots.

By the mid-20th century, &quot;sweet Fanny Adams&quot; had become a common minced oath or euphemistic alternative for the phrase &quot;sweet fuck all.&quot;

<doc id="1002491" wikidata="Q1125543" url="?curid=1002491" title="Rake receiver">
<text>A rake receiver is a radio receiver designed to counter the effects of multipath fading. It does this by using several &quot;sub-receivers&quot; called &quot;fingers&quot;, that is, several correlators each assigned to a different multipath component. Each finger independently decodes a single multipath component; at a later stage the contribution of all fingers are combined in order to make the most use of the different transmission characteristics of each transmission path. This could very well result in higher signal-to-noise ratio (or Eb/N0) in a multipath environment than in a &quot;clean&quot; environment.

The multipath channel through which a radio wave transmits can be viewed as transmitting the original (line of sight) wave pulse through a number of multipath components. Multipath components are delayed copies of the original transmitted wave traveling through a different echo path, each with a different magnitude and time-of-arrival at the receiver. Since each component contains the original information, if the magnitude and time-of-arrival (phase) of each component is computed at the receiver (through a process called channel estimation), then all the components can be added coherently to improve the information reliability.

== Mathematical definition ==
A rake receiver utilizes multiple correlators to separately detect the &quot;M&quot; strongest multipath components. Each correlator output may be quantized using several bits. Demodulation and bit decisions are then based on the weighted outputs of the &quot;M&quot; correlators, which provide a better estimate of the transmitted signal than is provided by a single component. 

== History ==
Rake receivers must have either a general-purpose CPU or some other form of digital signal processing hardware in them to process and correlate the intended signal. Rake receivers only became common after 16-bit CPUs capable of signal processing became widely available. The rake receiver was patented in the US by Robert Price and Paul E. Green in July 1956, (U.S. Pat. No. 2,982,853) but it took until the 1970s to design practical implementations of the receiver.

Radio astronomers were the first substantial users of rake receivers in the late 1960s to mid-1980s as this kind of receiver could scan large sky regions yet not create large volumes of data beyond what most data recorders could handle at the time. Astropulse, which is part of the SETI@Home project, uses a variant of a rake receiver as part of its sky searches—so this kind of receiver is still current for the needs of radio astronomy.

== Use ==
Rake receivers are common in a wide variety of CDMA and W-CDMA radio devices such as mobile phones and wireless LAN equipment.

Rake receivers are also used in radio astronomy. The CSIRO Parkes radio telescope and Jodrell Bank telescope have filter-bank recording formats that can be processed in real time by software-based rake receivers.

In a Flexible rake Receiver, signal reception is performed with a single correlator engine and a stream buffer storing the entire delay spread of baseband input/output (I/O) samples. The primary advantage of the rake receiver is flexible multipath allocation supporting enhanced modularity of the receiver and resource sharing among multiple channel decoders.

<doc id="1002502" wikidata="Q5500641" url="?curid=1002502" title="Freedom Tower Silver Dollar">
<text>The [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]] Silver Dollar is a &quot;one dollar&quot; coin minted under license of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in 2004, although the CNMI does not have legal authority to issue or authorize currency. Despite vague statements in advertisements, it is not issued by the United States Mint and is not considered legal tender, nor is it considered non-circulating legal tender. The CNMI receives royalty fees from proceeds of the sale of the coin. The coin is actually minted by SoftSky, a Wyoming commemorative coin maker.

== Description ==

The obverse of the coin features a rendered image of the original design proposal for the Freedom Tower by Daniel Libeskind that was to be built on the former site of the World Trade Center in New York City. Also on the obverse are the United States national motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and the words &quot;Freedom Tower, July 4, 2004.&quot; The reverse features an image of the former World Trade Center and the words &quot;We Will Never Forget&quot;, along with a small symbol of a star on a stone pillar within a circle. This latter unidentified icon is in fact the coat of arms of the Northern Mariana Islands.

== Legality ==

The distributor of the coin, National Collector&#x27;s Mint, advertises the item as &quot;legally authorized government issue&quot; and marks the coin with the valuation of &quot;One Dollar&quot;. This is seen as being a deliberate attempt to mislead American consumers into believing it is a legal tender coin produced by the United States Mint and is worth one U.S. dollar.
In reaction to advertising for this product, the U.S. Mint, as well as the attorneys general of various U.S. states, released a statement that the coin is not U.S. government issue. Furthermore, since the Northern Mariana Islands is a United States Commonwealth, it cannot mint its own legal tender currency (it uses regular American money).

The distributors also purport that the coins have been struck using silver recovered from a vault in the rubble of the World Trade Center. The validity of this claim has not been confirmed. Distributors warn that the minting of the coin will cease once the quantity of recovered silver has been exhausted, and have therefore placed a limit on the number of coins that can be ordered per person. The coins are not solid silver, but are silver clad (0.0001 inch (2.5 micrometre) layer). Actual silver content is 45 mg, or 0.00145 troy oz.

The territorial government of the CNMI has made money from commissioning commemorative, non-tender coins through SoftSky and National Collector&#x27;s Mint in the past, but does not claim the right to commission legal tender coinage. Some past coins issued by SoftSky, such as the 1933 Gold Double Eagle coin, have also incurred marketing controversy.

In October 2004 the attorney general of New York, Eliot Spitzer, obtained a court order against National Collectors Mint (a Port Chester, New York company) to halt sales of the &quot;Freedom Tower Silver Dollar&quot; coin, citing it as fraudulently advertised. Spitzer also alleged that the company&#x27;s sales contacts had asserted that the coin is legal tender. On October 13, 2004, Spitzer obtained a temporary order halting the company from advertising or selling the coin. On November 9, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph R. Cannizzaro ruled that the company had engaged in deceptive and fraudulent marketing practices, and ordered the company to terminate its misleading advertising of the coin.

An investigation as to the silver content and the origin of the silver in the coins was started. The attorney general&#x27;s office easily determined that the coin was only silver clad, but as of 2005 the veracity of the claim that this silver came from a World Trade Center bank vault had not been determined.

As a result of the controversy and legal action over the Freedom Tower coin, CNMI governor Juan N. Babauta suspended the SoftSky contract on November 13, 2004. On December 2, Babauta ended the contract. Before this course of events, the CNMI government made about $160,000 off the deal.

Other groups have also released silver Freedom Tower coins, but not with a denominational value or advertised as government issue.

The CNMI coin was named &quot;Stupid Investment of the Week&quot; by &quot;CBS MarketWatch&quot; on September 24, 2004.

==2005 Freedom Tower Dollar==
In 2005, a similar coin to the CNMI Freedom Tower coin was sold, with similar design and the same claim of being made from silver &quot;reclaimed&quot; from the World Trade Center, but bearing the name of the Cook Islands instead of the CNMI. The Cook Islands are a self-governing democracy, and do mint their own currency (at par with the New Zealand dollar), though this coin is sold as a &quot;non-circulating legal tender&quot; coin. As of February 19, 2014 this Company still has a catalog selling
&quot;World Trade Center &#x27;Recovery Silver&#x27; Silver Eagle Dollars&quot; for $99.00 with a claim that all silver has been independently verified as authentic from Ground Zero by a former Asst. Director of the FBI.

==2001–2006 World Trade Center Gold and Silver Clad Commemorative==

As of 2006, the National Collectors Mint was offering what is variously described as &quot;2001–2006 World Trade Center Gold and Silver Clad Commemorative&quot;, &quot;2001–2006 World Trade Center Commemorative&quot;, and &quot;5th Anniversary World Trade Center Commemorative&quot;. It is advertised as a &quot;non-monetary issue&quot; that &quot;will never be released for circulation.&quot;

This coin is a two piece set of a gold coin with a detachable silver inset of the World Trade Center complex and claims to contain &quot;15 mg. of 24 KT gold and 15 mg. of .999 Pure silver clad,&quot; and also continued to claim that the silver was found in a bank vault buried under the rubble of Ground Zero. For comparison, a U.S. dollar coin is 8.1 g and a dime is 2.268 g, meaning that the precious metal content of the commemorative coin is likely between 0.4% and 1.3% of the total mass.

It was discovered that the silver analyzed was, indeed, not silver, and was only worth about 32 cents.

The company claims that &quot;$5 of every 2001–2006 World Trade Center Commemorative order is donated to official 9/11 family charities and memorials.&quot;
This claim has not been verified.

<text>Frances Elizabeth Bavier (December 14, 1902 – December 6, 1989) was an American stage and television actress. Originally from New York theatre, she worked in film and television from the 1950s until the 1970s. She is best known for her role as Aunt Bee on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; from 1960 to 1970. Aunt Bee logged more Mayberry years (ten) than any other character. She won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Comedy Actress for the role in 1967. Bavier was also known for playing Amy Morgan on &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; (1954–1956).

==Early life and career==
Bavier was born in New York City in a brownstone on Gramercy Park to Charles S. Bavier, a stationary engineer, and Mary S. (née Birmingham) Bavier. She originally planned to become a teacher after attending Columbia University. She first appeared in vaudeville, later moving to the Broadway stage.

After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1925, she was cast in the stage comedy &quot;The Poor Nut&quot;. Bavier&#x27;s big break came in the original Broadway production of &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot;. She later appeared with Henry Fonda in the play &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.

Bavier had roles in more than a dozen films, and played a range of supporting roles on television. Career highlights include her turn as Mrs. Barley in the classic 1951 film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. In 1955, she played the rough and tough &quot;Aunt Maggie&quot; Sawtelle, a frontier Ma Barker-type character, in the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; episode &quot;Sawtelle&#x27;s Saga End&quot;. In 1957, she played Nora Martin, mother of Eve Arden&#x27;s character on &quot;The Eve Arden Show&quot;, despite the fact that Arden was less than six years younger than Bavier. That same year, Bavier guest-starred in the eighth episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Louise Marlow in &quot;The Case of the Crimson Kiss&quot;.

She was in an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, which featured Andy Griffith as Andy Taylor and Ron Howard as Opie Taylor. She played a character named Henrietta Perkins. The episode led to &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and Bavier was cast in the role of Aunt Bee. Bavier had a love-hate relationship with her famous role during the run of the show. As a New York City actress, she felt her dramatic talents were being overlooked, yet after playing Bee for eight seasons, she was the only original cast member to remain with the series in the spin-off, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, for two additional seasons.

Bavier was easily offended on the set of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and the production staff took a cautious approach when communicating with her. Series star Andy Griffith once admitted the two sometimes clashed during the series’ run. On an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; (November 27, 2003), Griffith said Bavier phoned him four months before she died and apologized for being &quot;difficult&quot; during the series’ run. Bavier confessed in an interview with Bill Ballard for Carolina Camera that &quot;it is very difficult for an actress ... to create a role and to be so identified that you as a person no longer exist and all the recognition you get is for a part that is created on the screen.&quot;

Bavier won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Comedy in 1967.

==Later years==
In 1972, Bavier retired from acting and bought a home in Siler City, North Carolina. On choosing to live in North Carolina instead of her native New York, Bavier said, &quot;I fell in love with North Carolina, all the pretty roads and the trees.&quot; Bavier was said to have married Russell Carpenter briefly in her early career, but there is no proof of this having actually occurred. According to a 1981 article by Chip Womick, a staff writer of &quot;The Courier Tribune&quot;, Bavier enthusiastically promoted Christmas and Easter Seal Societies from her Siler City home, and often wrote inspirational letters to fans who sought autographs. Additionally she left a $100,000 trust fund for the police force in Siler City, North Carolina whose interest is divided among the approximately 20 employees as a bonus every December.

==Death==

Bavier was described &quot;as living a sparse life in her later years, a very quiet life&quot;. On November 22, 1989, she was admitted to Chatham Hospital, where she was kept in the coronary care unit for two weeks. She was discharged on December 4, 1989. Bavier died at 7 p.m. on December 6, 1989, two days after being released from the hospital and eight days before her 87th birthday. The immediate causes of death were listed as congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and atherosclerosis, with supporting factors being breast cancer, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bavier is interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Siler City. Her headstone includes the name of her most famous role, &quot;Aunt Bee&quot;, and reads, &quot;To live in the hearts of those left behind is not to die.&quot;

<text>The Town-class destroyers were a group of 50 destroyers of the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy that were in service during the Second World War. They were transferred from the United States Navy in exchange for military bases in the British West Indies and Newfoundland, as outlined in the Destroyers for Bases Agreement between the United Kingdom and United States, signed on 2 September 1940. They were known as &quot;four-pipers&quot; or &quot;four-stackers&quot; because they had four smokestacks (funnels). Later classes of destroyers typically had one or two.

Some went to the Royal Canadian Navy at the outset. Others went on to the Royal Norwegian Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Soviet Navy after serving with the Royal Navy. Although given a set of names by the Commonwealth navies that suggested they were one class they actually came from three classes of destroyer: , , and . &quot;Town class&quot; refers to the Admiralty&#x27;s practice of renaming these ships after towns common to the United States and the British Commonwealth. Ships initially commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy, however, followed the Canadian practice of giving destroyers the names of Canadian rivers. The rivers selected for the &quot;Town&quot; class were on the border between Canada and the United States, with the exception of Annapolis — the name of both a river in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, and the location of the United States Naval Academy.

One of the Town-class ships achieved lasting fame: (ex-). In the Commando raid Operation Chariot, &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, fitted with a large demolition charge, rammed the gates of the Normandie dock at Saint-Nazaire, France. The charge detonated on 29 March 1942, breaching the drydock and destroying &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, thus destroying the only drydock on the Atlantic coast capable of accepting the . This exploit was depicted in the 1950 Trevor Howard film &quot;The Gift Horse&quot;, which starred (ex-) after her return from service in the Soviet Union.

==Characteristics==
Built for service during the First World War, but in the main completed after the end of that conflict, the flush-deckers were, by 1940, the oldest destroyers in the US Navy, and many had been mothballed for the inter-war period. 
While contemporaneous to the British s they were not much liked by their crews. While the V and W classes set a new standard for destroyer design, the flush-deckers were already obsolescent by comparison. They were uncomfortable and wet, working badly in a seaway. Their hull lines were rather narrow and &#x27;herring-gutted&#x27; which gave them a vicious roll. The officers didn&#x27;t like the way they handled either, since they had been built with propellers that turned the same way (2-screw ships normally have the shafts turning in opposite directions as the direction of rotation has effects on the rudder and the whole ship when manoeuvring, especially when coming alongside), so these were as awkward to handle as single-screw ships. Their turning circle was enormous, as big as most Royal Navy battleships, making them difficult to use in a submarine hunt which demanded tight manoeuvres, compounded by unreliable &quot;chain and cog&quot; steering gear laid across the main deck. They also had fully enclosed bridges which caused problems with reflections in the glass at night. One Royal Canadian Navy corvette captain described them as &quot;the most dubious gift since the Trojan Horse&quot;.
However, despite their disadvantages they were a welcome addition to forces escorting convoys in the Atlantic at a time when the U-boats, operating from newly acquired bases on the Atlantic coast of France were becoming an increasingly serious threat to British shipping. They were also seen as an earnest of the United States’ commitment to support Britain against Nazism.

The original armament was four 4-inch (102 mm) guns, one 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun, and twelve torpedo tubes. On the &quot;Wickes-&quot;class, the 4-inch gun placement was one gun in a shield on the foredeck, one on the quarterdeck and one each side on a platform between the number 2 and number 3 funnels. The Admiralty promptly removed one of the 4-inch guns and six torpedo tubes to improve stability. Twenty-three of the class had further armament reductions for anti-submarine escort of trade convoys. Two of the remaining 4-inch guns and three of the remaining torpedo tubes were removed to allow increased depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar system.

==Ships in class by origin==
The ships were divided by the Royal Navy into four groups based on their characteristics.
*Type A corresponded to the 20 ships of the , having a standard displacement of 1,190 tons powered by geared turbines that produced a maximum speed of 28.5 knots. They were armed with four single 4-inch guns and one 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, with triple 21-inch torpedo tubes. Overall length was 314 ft 4 in, beam 31 ft 8 in and draught 12 ft 10 in.
*Type B were the 12 ships of the built to plans prepared by the Bath Iron Works. These were lighter than the type A ships, with a displacement of 1090 tons but they had the same armament and machinery with a slightly better speed of 28.75 kt.
*Type C were the 15 ships of the &quot;Wickes&quot; class built to plans prepared by Bethlehem Steel, with a displacement of 1,060 tons and an improved speed of 29.75 kt.
*Type D were the 3 ships of the , smaller again at 1020 tons, with a gun armament of four single 3-inch guns and built with direct drive turbines, but having a speed of 30 kt. The type D vessels were recognizable also in having only three funnels.

<text>Daniel Edward Howard (4 August 1861 – 9 July 1935) was the 16th president of Liberia, serving from 1912 to 1920. 

Howard was elected president in 1911 and assumed office on 1 January 1912. With the outbreak of World War I, he attempted to maintain the country&#x27;s neutrality, though he tended to support the Allies, whose colonial territories in Africa surrounded Liberia. Despite German protests, he allowed the French to operate a wireless station in the capital, Monrovia. Realizing that their complaints were in vain, the Germans sent a submarine to attack the city in 1917, forcing the reluctant Howard to side with the Allies and declare war on Germany.

Howard remained in office for two years after the war&#x27;s end. He died in Monrovia in 1935.

==Before Presidency==
Born in the town of Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, Daniel Edward Howard was the son of Thomas Howard, chairman of the National True Whig Party and Treasurer of Liberia. He was educated at Liberia College.

He worked his way up through the civil service to become secretary of the True Whig Party, the country&#x27;s only political party at the time. Howard was the Secretary of the Treasury before becoming the president. 

==Presidency (1912–1920)==

Daniel Edward Howard was the President of Liberia from 1912 to 1920. The finances of Liberia were so shaky that the pay of government employees was often suspended for months at a time.

===Rebellion of indigenous===
In 1915, the coastal Kru people, who had long resisted Monrovia&#x27;s authority, rose in rebellion, declaring their loyalty to Great Britain and demanding annexation by Crown Colony of Sierra Leone. In response, the United States diverted the USS &quot;Chester&quot; to Africa en route home from Turkey to help quash the uprising.

===World War I===

At the outbreak of World War I, President Howard attempted to maintain the country&#x27;s neutrality. However, he tended to support the Allies, whose colonial territories in Africa surrounded Liberia and whose naval superiority quickly disrupted trade with Germany. As Germany was Liberia&#x27;s major trading partner, the loss of customs revenue severely impacted government finances. What little revenue remained was diminished by the blockade imposed by German submarines which effectively halted trade between Liberia and the Allies as well. Since Liberia&#x27;s economy was almost completely dependent on export revenues, this sudden evaporation of customs revenues forced Liberia to postpone payment on the $1.7 million loan, and led President Daniel E. Howard to seek a $5 million loan from the Woodrow Wilson Administration. However, the United States Congress refused to approve the loan.

Despite German protests, Howard allowed the French to operate a wireless station in the capital, Monrovia. Realizing that their complaints were in vain, the Germans sent a submarine to attack the city in 1917, forcing the reluctant Howard to side with the Allies and declare war on Germany on 12 January 1918.

Liberia then liquidated the property of German nationals in Liberia. The money generated from this liquidation was deposited into the Liberian government bank account to compensate for loss of revenue from the blockade. The war ended in 1918, and Liberia&#x27;s legislature ratified the Treaty of Versailles.

===Territorial conflicts===
In 1919, Liberia became a charter member of the League of Nations.

Conflicts over territorial claims again resulted in the loss of land to Britain and/or France in 1919. Whenever the British and French seemed intent on enlarging at Liberia&#x27;s expense the neighboring territories they already controlled, periodic appearances by U.S. warships helped discourage encroachment, even though successive American administrations rejected appeals from Monrovia for more forceful support.

<text>Chrysolepis is a small genus of plants in the family Fagaceae, endemic to the western United States. Its two species have the common name chinquapin. The genus occurs from western Washington south to the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and east into Nevada.

==Description==
&quot;Chrysolepis&quot; are evergreen trees and shrubs with simple, entire (untoothed) leaves with a dense layer of golden scales on the underside and a thinner layer on the upper side; the leaves persist for 3–4 years before falling.

The fruit is a densely spiny cupule containing 1–3 sweet, edible nuts, eaten by the indigenous peoples. The fruit also provides food for chipmunks and squirrels.

&quot;Chrysolepis&quot; is related to the subtropical southeast Asian genus &quot;Castanopsis&quot; (in which it was formerly included), but differs in the nuts being triangular and fully enclosed in a sectioned cupule, and in having bisexual catkins. &quot;Chrysolepis&quot; also differs from another allied genus &quot;Castanea&quot; (chestnuts), in nuts that take 14–16 months to mature (3–5 months in &quot;Castanea&quot;), evergreen leaves and the shoots having a terminal bud.

===Species===
There are two species of &quot;Chrysolepis&quot; — &quot;Chrysolepis chrysophylla&quot; and &quot;Chrysolepis sempervirens&quot; — which like many species in the related genera of &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and &quot;Castanea&quot; are called chinquapin, also spelled &quot;chinkapin&quot;.

<doc id="1002527" wikidata="Q849450" url="?curid=1002527" title="Tab (interface)">
<text>In interface design, a tab is a graphical user interface object that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, using tabs as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panels, with window managers and tiling window managers.

Tabs are modeled after traditional card tabs inserted in paper files or card indexes (in keeping with the desktop metaphor). They are usually graphically displayed on webpages or apps as they look on paper.

Tabs may appear in a horizontal bar or as a vertical list. Horizontal tabs may have multiple rows. In some cases, tabs may be reordered or organized into multiple rows through drag and drop interactions. Implementations may support opening an existing tab in a separate window or range-selecting multiple tabs for moving, closing, or separating them.

==History==
The WordVision DOS word processor for the IBM PC in 1982 was perhaps the first commercially available product with a tabbed interface.
Don Hopkins developed and released several versions of tabbed window frames for the NeWS window system as free software, which the window manager applied to all NeWS applications, and enabled users to drag the tabs around to any edge of the window.

The NeWS version of UniPress&#x27;s Gosling Emacs text editor was another early product with multiple tabbed windows in 1988. It was used to develop an authoring tool for Ben Shneiderman&#x27;s hypermedia browser HyperTIES (the NeWS workstation version of The Interactive Encyclopedia System), in 1988 at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. HyperTIES also supported pie menus for managing windows and browsing hypermedia documents with PostScript applets.

While Boeing Calc already utilized tabbed sheets (as so-called &quot;word pads&quot;) since at least 1987, Borland&#x27;s Quattro Pro popularized tabs for spreadsheets in 1992. Microsoft Word in 1993 used them to simplify submenus. In 1994, BookLink Technologies featured tabbed windows in its InternetWorks browser. That same year, the text editor UltraEdit also appeared with a modern multi-row tabbed interface. The tabbed interface approach was then followed by the Internet Explorer shell NetCaptor in 1997. These were followed by several others like IBrowse in 1999, and Opera in 2000 (with the release of version 4 - although an MDI interface was supported before then), MultiViews October 2000, which changed its name into MultiZilla on April 1st, 2001 (an extension for the Mozilla Application Suite), Galeon in early 2001, Mozilla 0.9.5 in October 2001, Phoenix 0.1 (now Mozilla Firefox) in October 2002, Konqueror 3.1 in January 2003, and Safari in 2003. With the release of Internet Explorer 7 in 2006, all major web browsers featured a tabbed interface.

Users quickly adopted the use of tabs in web browsing and web search. A study of tabbed browsing behavior in June 2009 found that users switched tabs in 57% of tab sessions, and 36% of users used new tabs to open search engine results at least once during that period.

Numerous additional browser tab capabilities have emerged since then. One example is visual tabbed browsing in OmniWeb version 5, which displays preview images of pages in a drawer to the left or right of the main browser window. Another feature is the ability to re-order tabs and to bookmark all of the webpages opened in tab panes in a given window in a group or bookmark folder (as well as the ability to reopen all of them at the same time). Microsoft Internet Explorer marks tab families with different colours.

==Development==
Tab behavior in an application is determined by the underlying widget toolkit (for example Firefox uses GTK) framework. Due to lack of standardization, behavior may vary from one application to the next, which can result in usability challenges.

==Tab hoarding==

&quot;Tab hoarding&quot; is digital hoarding of web browser tabs. Users may accumulate tabs as reminders of tasks to research or complete (rather than using dedicated reminder software). They may use multiple browser windows to organize tabs or direct focus; however, leaving multiple windows open can exacerbate tab clutter.

Tab hoarding can lead to stress and information overload, distraction, and reduced computer performance. It can develop into emotional attachment to the set of open tabs, including fear of losing them upon a crash or other reboot, and conversely, relief when tabs are properly restored. Tab hoarders have attributed the behavior to anxiety, fear of missing out, procrastination, and poor personal information management practices.

The prevalence of tab hoarding is acknowledged by browser vendors such as Mozilla, and has inspired memory and tab management features in browsers and extensions. Such features include tab grouping, which allows related tabs to be visually organized and collapsed; conversion of tabs into a list of hyperlinks; and alternative interface paradigms, such as framing high-level tasks as first-class objects instead of tabs. A 2021 study developed UI design considerations which could enable better tools and changes to the code of web browsers that allow knowledge workers and other users to better manage and utilize their browser tabs.

==Implementations==
CSS frameworks which have tabs include Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS and Foundation.

Widget toolkits which have tabs include GTK using the widget as well as the Adwaita library using the widget. Qt using the widget.
