<text>CSKA Sofia () is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in Sofia and currently competing in the country&#x27;s premier football competition, the First League. &quot;CSKA&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Central Sports Club of the Army&quot; (), named after the Bulgarian Army. CSKA is the most successful football club of Bulgaria according to the Europe&#x27;s Club of the Century ranking of the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS).

Officially established on 5 May 1948, CSKA&#x27;s roots date back to an army officers&#x27; club founded in 1923. The club has won a record 31 Bulgarian titles and 21 Bulgarian Cups. Internationally, CSKA are the only Bulgarian club to have reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, which they have done twice, and they have also reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup once.

CSKA&#x27;s home colors are red and white and its home ground is the Bulgarian Army Stadium. The club&#x27;s biggest rivals are Levski Sofia and matches between the two sides are known as &quot;The Eternal Derby of Bulgaria&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1923–1948 ===
In November 1923, football clubs &quot;Athletic Sofia&quot; and &quot;Slava Sofia&quot; merged to form AS-23, short for &quot;Officers&#x27; Sports Club Athletic Slava 1923&quot;, under the patronage of the Ministry of War, which provided the equipment.

In 1931, AS-23 won their first Bulgarian championship and The Tsar&#x27;s Cup, followed by another Tsar&#x27;s Cup in 1941. The club&#x27;s stadium (completed in 1938) was named &quot;Athletic Park&quot; and was situated where the Bulgarian Army Stadium now resides.

On 9 November 1944, with the support of Mihail Mihaylov, an accountant at the Ministry of War and a patron of Shipka Sofia, a unifying agreement was signed, merging &quot;AS-23&quot;, &quot;Shipka&quot;, and &quot;Spartak (Poduene)&quot; to form Chavdar Sofia. Gen. Vladimir Stoychev from AS-23, who at the time was fighting on the front in World War II, was appointed (by telegram) as the new club&#x27;s chairman. Lawyer Ivan Bashev, a future Bulgarian foreign minister, was appointed club secretary and the person in charge of football.

=== 1948–1962 ===

With the help of Mihail Mihaylov again, in February 1948, Chavdar became the departmental club of the Central House of the Troops (&quot;Centralnia Dom na Voiskata&quot;) and took on the name of CDV. Looking for ways to stop the club&#x27;s decline, CDV&#x27;s administrators sought to merge it with another club. In May 1948, an agreement was reached between CDV and Septemvri Sofia (which had already earned a place in the play-offs) for uniting the clubs under the name &quot;Septemvri pri CDV&quot; (Septemvri at CDV). The contract was signed on 5 May 1948, which is officially considered the club&#x27;s date of foundation.

The club&#x27;s played its first official match on 19 May 1948 against Slavia Sofia at Yunak Stadium, a 1–1 draw. Septemvri pri CDV eliminated Aprilov (Gabrovo) and Spartak Varna en route to the final, where it faced Levski Sofia, losing 1–2 in the first leg. The decisive second match occurred on 9 September 1948. Septemvri pri CDV&#x27;s lineup consisted of: Stefan Gerenski, Borislav Futekov, Manol Manolov, Dimitar Cvetkov, Nikola Aleksiev, Nako Chakmakov (captain), Dimitar Milanov, Stoyne Minev, Stefan Bozhkov, Nikola Bozhilov and Kiril Bogdanov. The score was 3–3 on aggregate, as Septemvri pri CDV led 2–1 near the end of regulation time, when a last-minute goal by Nako Chakmakov gave the club its first ever title.

In 1950, the word &quot;Narodna&quot; (&quot;Peoples&quot; in English) was added to the name of the Central House of the Troops, changing it to Central House of the People&#x27;s Troops (&quot;Centralen Dom na Narodnata Voiska&quot; in English), or C.D.N.V., effectively changing the club&#x27;s name. The following two years, C.D.N.V. won two consecutive titles. In 1951, the club clinched their first double. In 1953, the club was again renamed by the authorities, this time to Otbor na Sofiyskiya Garnizon (&quot;Team of the Sofia Garrison&quot;), and most of the key players were illegally transferred out. The title was lost.

The following year, the club was renamed CDNA (&quot;Central House of the People&#x27;s Army&quot;), and the years between 1954 and 1962 marked one of the most successful periods for &quot;the Reds&quot;, who won nine consecutive titles (an unprecedented achievement in Bulgarian football at the time and a record the club held for 60 years) and, in 1956, took part in the second installment of the newly created European Cup competition, reaching the quarter-finals.

=== 1960s ===
In 1962, CDNA was merged with DSO Cherveno Zname to form CSKA Cherveno Zname (&quot;CSKA Red Flag&quot;). The Central House of the People&#x27;s Troops ceased its affiliation with the club, which was taken over by the Ministry of People&#x27;s Defense. CSKA finished third after Spartak Plovdiv and Botev Plovdiv in the 1962–63 season. The following season, CSKA had its worst performance in the Bulgarian championship to date, finishing 11th in the final table, only three points from relegation. This led to the sacking of legendary coach Krum Milev after 16 years at the helm.

CSKA did not recapture the title until 1966. However, during the 1966–67 season, CSKA recorded its first major international achievement, reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup for the first time, where they faced Italian giants Inter. After two hard-fought 1–1 draws, a third decisive match was played, which CSKA lost 0–1.

The next two seasons were unmemorable for the &quot;Army Men&quot;, finishing in fifth and second place respectively. In 1968, CSKA underwent another merger, joining with Septemvri Sofia and taking on the name of CSKA Septemvriysko Zname (&quot;CSKA September Flag&quot;). The club clinched the title in 1969 with the help of recent acquisition Petar Zhekov, who would go on to become the top Bulgarian goalscorer of all time, a record Zhekov held for 52 years until he was surpassed by Martin Kamburov in 2021.

=== 1970s ===

The 1970s are widely considered the period when CSKA made its name on the European stage. The club began the decade modestly, claiming second place domestically and reaching the round of 16 in 1970–71 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they fell to English side Chelsea 0–2 on aggregate. However, from 1971 to 1973, CSKA won three consecutive titles and delivered one of the biggest surprises in European football when it eliminated reigning European champion Ajax – considered the finest team of all time – 2–1 on aggregate in the 1973–74 European Cup.

They then faced German champions Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. After losing 1–4 in the first leg in Munich, CSKA bowed out of the competition following a 2–1 win at home. Between 1975 and 1979, the club won two more domestic titles.

=== 1980s ===
The 1980–81 season was again a memorable one for CSKA Sofia, winning the Bulgarian title once more and twice beating European champion Nottingham Forest, both times with 1–0 scorelines, before being stopped by the future European champions Liverpool with a 6–1 defeat on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the European Cup.

The next season, CSKA reached their second-straight European Cup semi-final, eliminating Spanish champions Real Sociedad, Glentoran and Liverpool after losing 0–1 in England and winning 2–0 at home with two goals by Stoycho Mladenov. In the semi-final, the &quot;Reds&quot; again faced Bayern Munich. The first leg was held in Sofia and started with a full dominance over Bayern, as by the 16th minute, CSKA were leading 3–0 in front of 85,000 jubilant spectators who saw the European final in their dreams. But the final score was 4–3 for CSKA. In Munich, the club suffered a 4–0 defeat, ending what is still the deepest run by a Bulgarian side in the European Cup or UEFA Champions League.

In the domestic league, CSKA did not let go of the title until the 1984–85 season, where they finished second behind arch-rivals Levski, but still managed to reach the Bulgarian Cup final.

On 18 June 1985, the final for the Bulgarian Cup was held at the Vasil Levski National Stadium between CSKA and Levski Sofia. The match was marked by many questionable referee decisions and saw several brutal fights, including an assault on a referee by some of Levski&#x27;s players. CSKA won the match 2–1, even though they had missed a penalty when the score was 2–0. By decree of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, both teams were disbanded and re-founded under new management. CSKA was renamed Sredets while Levski was renamed &quot;Vitosha&quot;. Several players were banned from participating in official matches for varying periods of time, including Hristo Stoichkov and Kostadin Yanchev from CSKA. One year later, the committee&#x27;s decision was reversed and the players were reinstated.

As Sredets, the club finished in fourth place in the 1985–86 season. In 1987, the club was renamed CFKA Sredets (&quot;Central Football Club of the Army Sredets&quot;), and the following three years were marked by a formidable performance, even as Septemvri Sofia ended their 20-year partnership with CFKA in 1988 and became an independent club again. Coached by Dimitar Penev, CFKA won the title in 1987 and 1989 and reached the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-finals against Barcelona in 1989. In reaching this stage in the tournament, CFKA had eliminated Roda JC after penalty kicks following a 2–1 win at home and a 1–2 loss away. Barcelona, coached by former Dutch international Johan Cruyff, won both matches (4–2 in Barcelona and 2–1 in Sofia) and CFKA were eliminated, but Cruyff did notice the talent of Hristo Stoichkov and decided to bring him to Barcelona the following year, effectively launching Stoichkov&#x27;s international career.

=== 1990s ===
The decade, immediately following the fall of communism, brought turbulent changes to Bulgarian football, and the club was not spared. The CSKA name was restored starting with the 1989–90 season and they won the title again. In March 1991, former footballer and administrator Valentin Mihov was chosen as president of CSKA. The club bought some of the most talented Bulgarian players, including Yordan Letchkov, Ivaylo Andonov and Stoycho Stoilov, among others. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense concluded their affiliation with the club. Despite the uncertainty and the numerous problems that followed, CSKA won the title again in 1992. They were later eliminated in the first round of the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League by Austria Wien after losing 1–3 in Vienna and winning 3–2 in Sofia.

In the meantime, Valentin Mihov was appointed president of the Bulgarian Football Union and Petar Kalpakchiev was chosen as his replacement. However, Kalpakchiev wrangled with the club&#x27;s administration over their decisions to replace several coaches, one of which was Gjoko Hadžievski, considered to be leading the club in the right direction, and eventually he was fired.

The owner of the Multigroup conglomerate, Iliya Pavlov, took over as president, but ultimately his sponsorship proved insufficient to overcome the club&#x27;s ineffective management. Five coaches were changed in just one season, with Tsvetan Yonchev being coach for just one day. In Europe, CSKA nevertheless defeated Juventus 3–2 in the first round of the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, but the result was annulled by UEFA because of the delayed player-indexing of forward Petar Mihtarski, and Juventus were awarded a 3–0 victory by default. In the second leg in Turin, CSKA succumbed to a 5–1 defeat.

In the summer of 1995, CSKA made a strong selection and eventually the club included half of the youth national football team of Bulgaria. Plamen Markov was appointed head coach, but after a disappointing first half of the season, he was replaced by Georgi Vasilev, who had previously won three Bulgarian titles (one with Etar Veliko Tarnovo and two with Levski Sofia). Vasilev managed to win a double with CSKA for the 1996–97 season, entering the second qualifying round of the Champions League against Steaua București. After a dramatic 3–3 in Bucharest, CSKA fell 0–2 at home.

Vasilev was unexpectedly released from the club at the beginning of the second half of the 1997–98 season after a 3–0 win over Spartak Pleven. Coach Petar Zehtinski took his place. That year, the club saw the return of Hristo Stoichkov, Emil Kostadinov and Trifon Ivanov, but the three of them challenged each other for the captain&#x27;s band. Stoichkov played in only four matches and left CSKA right before the derby with Levski to play for a club in Saudi Arabia. After the end of the season, Ivanov also left the club. CSKA finished in third place.

In the summer of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as head coach for the second time. CSKA reached the second round of the UEFA Cup and won the Bulgarian Cup, but disappointed in the domestic league, finishing in fifth place in 1999. That season, the young talents of Martin Petrov, Stilian Petrov, Dimitar Berbatov and Vladimir Manchev started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to Neftochimik. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the 1999–2000 season and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the shareholders meeting at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov.

=== 2000s ===
After the first two fixtures in the spring of 2000, which the club lost, Dimitar Penev was relieved as coach and in his place was appointed Georgi Dimitrov – Jacky, who was later replaced by Spas Dzhevizov. After a 1–1 draw with Pirin at Bulgarian Army Stadium, Dzhevizov handed in his resignation and Aleksandar Stankov took his place. Even though at times CSKA had fallen as far as nine points behind league leaders Levski, the club shortened the difference to only two points before the decisive match for the title at Georgi Asparuhov Stadium. CSKA dominated Levski for most of the match, as Dimitar Berbatov made several serious misses, but a last-minute goal from Georgi Ivanov secured the title for Levski.

In the summer of 2000, the Italian Enrico Catuzzi was retained as head coach, who managed to revive the team. However, even though the &quot;Army Men&quot; played attractive matches under his leadership, Catuzzi resigned during the winter break, citing family problems. Aleksandar Stankov was appointed as coach again, but was replaced by Catuzzi again after two losses from Litex for the cup and the championship. &quot;The Reds&quot; finished second, seven points behind Levski.

To start the 2001–02 season, CSKA&#x27;s head coach was Asparuh Nikodimov, who would be fired during the winter break, as CSKA was situated two points behind Levski. He was replaced by another Italian, Luigi Simoni. Simoni failed to make CSKA champions as the club finished third and lost the Bulgarian Cup final to Levski. Simoni left at the end of the season.

In the summer of 2002, former CSKA striker Stoycho Mladenov was appointed as head coach. With him, the team set a record of 13 consecutive wins in 13 matches and won the title for the first time since 1997. However, Mladenov was fired the following season after losing to Galatasaray in the qualifying rounds of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League and after giving a less than impressive performance in the first round of the UEFA Cup, where the club lost on penalty kicks to Torpedo Moscow. Immediately after, two of the new arrivals, Léo Lima and Rodrigo Sousa, purchased for a total of 3 million dollars the year before, left the club on the grounds they had not received two monthly salaries. FIFA decided they had the right to leave and that CSKA had to pay them and release the players to their former club, Vasco da Gama. Alexander Stankov was temporarily appointed as head coach until the winter break, when Ferario Spasov officially took over. At the end of 2004, Spasov was replaced by Serbian coach Miodrag Ješić, despite the club&#x27;s first place in the league. With Ješić at the helm, CSKA won their record 30th domestic title in 2005.

For the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, after eliminating Tirana in the second qualifying round, CSKA were paired against reigning European champions Liverpool. The club lost 1–3 in the first match in Sofia, but surprisingly won the second leg 1–0 away at Anfield.

In the UEFA Cup, &quot;the Reds&quot; eliminated Bayer Leverkusen (with Dimitar Berbatov in the team) with two 1–0 wins and reached the group stage, where they finished fifth with three points from four matches and were eliminated. During the winter break of the 2005–06 season, the club was in first place, seven points ahead of Levski. However, during the spring, CSKA lost the seven-point advantage and ultimately finished second, three points behind Levski. Club president Vasil Bozhkov blamed head coach Miodrag Ješić for the failure to capture the title and fired him, while some supporters blamed Bozhkov instead.

Former CSKA head coach Plamen Markov was appointed in Ješić&#x27;s place. Bozhkov then announced that he would restrict the finances of the club and that during the upcoming season CSKA will not be aiming at the title. In December 2006, Bozhkov sold the club to Indian steel tycoon and owner of Kremikovtzi AD, Pramod Mittal, brother of ArcelorMittal&#x27;s Lakshmi Mittal. Former Bulgarian politician Aleksandar Tomov became president of the club and assured the supporters that CSKA would, in fact, be aiming at both the championship and the cup. After two draws in the beginning of the spring half of 2006–07, CSKA found themselves six points behind Levski. As a result, Plamen Markov was replaced by Stoycho Mladenov. CSKA finished second.

During the beginning of the 2007–08 season, CSKA purchased players for more than €2 million. The team was unluckily eliminated from the UEFA Cup in the first round by French side Toulouse after a 96th-minute goal from André-Pierre Gignac in the second leg. CSKA was also eliminated from the Bulgarian Cup in the Round of 16 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv. The match was engulfed in a scandal because of three CSKA players who at the time were on loan at Lokomotiv (Stoyko Sakaliev, Aleksandar Branekov and Ivan Ivanov). The players had clauses in their contracts restricting them from playing matches against CSKA, but Lokomotiv&#x27;s management used the players anyway.

At the end of the season, the &quot;Army Men&quot; secured the title well in advance, finishing 16 points ahead of second-placed Levski and without losing a single match. On 5 May 2008, the club marked its 60th birthday with big celebrations organized by the management. An alley of fame was built, comprising the names of the most successful current and former players of CSKA. On 24 May 2008, an exhibition match was played between the current squad and a mixed team of Bulgarian and foreign football stars. The mixed team was coached by former German international Lothar Matthäus, who was a special guest for the anniversary celebrations. The match ended 6–6.

In June 2008, only days after CSKA won its 31st title, UEFA notified the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) that the club would not receive a license for participating in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League because of unpaid obligations. The BFU then speculated this could also result in CSKA not being able to take part in the domestic championship, effectively turning it into an amateur club. Attempts to arrange a settlement with UEFA proved unsuccessful and CSKA lost its right to compete in the Champions League in favor of runners-up Levski Sofia. The person widely blamed for the crisis was club president Aleksandar Tomov, who resigned shortly after and was arrested and charged with embezzling millions of levs from CSKA and Kremikovtzi AD.

The problems with the license exposed the club&#x27;s weak financial situation and led to chaos and panic, prompting many of the key players to flee, including head coach Stoycho Mladenov himself, who left saying he was not happy with the fire sale of so many important players. The future of CSKA looked grim, its status as a professional club hanging in the balance. In the midst of the crisis, Dimitar Penev was given the head coach&#x27;s job for the third time and burdened with the task of saving the club. With almost all senior players gone, Penev had no choice but to rely on members of the CSKA youth squad.

Ultimately, CSKA managed to fulfill all licensing requirements set by the BFU and was allowed to compete in A Group. Despite all the difficulties, and to the surprise of the whole football community, Penev&#x27;s young squad claimed the Bulgarian Supercup in August 2008, overcoming Litex 1–0.

At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, the club managed to strengthen their ranks by signing Bulgarian internationals Zdravko Lazarov and Vladimir Manchev. On 24 December 2008, club owner Pramod Mittal announced he had signed a preliminary contract with a local investor to sell the club. The deal was finalized on 6 March 2009, and the ownership of the club was transferred to Titan Sport EAD, a subsidiary of Bulgarian waste management company Titan AS. Meanwhile, coach Dimitar Penev was replaced by his nephew, Lyuboslav Penev, who set aggressive goals for the club. After having led the league for most of the season, CSKA finished the championship in second place, one point behind arch-rivals Levski.

In 2009, CSKA earned a place in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League&#x27;s group stage after defeating Dynamo Moscow in the qualifying round and drew Roma, Basel and Fulham in the group stage. The first match was against Fulham in Sofia, where CSKA took the lead thanks to a beautiful goal by newly signed from Chernomoretz Burgas Brazilian Michel Platini. However, a simple goalkeeper mistake at the end of the match allowed Fulham to score, ending the game in a 1–1 draw. Despite the strong start, CSKA did not manage to earn any more points in the group stage and exited the competition after finishing fourth in its group. In November 2009, coach Luboslav Penev threatened to resign following a squabble with the club&#x27;s management after they had reversed his decision to reprimand several players for disciplinary reasons, but decided to carry on with the job. Their disagreements eventually boiled over in January 2010 and the board relieved Penev of the position. Reports in the press pointed to former CSKA coach Miodrag Ješić as a possible replacement, but even though Ješić expressed a desire to come back to CSKA, his current contract with Libyan club Alittihad Tripoli ruled him out. On 17 January, the club retained Romanian specialist Ioan Andone as coach. Andone brought two Romanian players with him and set out to overhaul the team. However, over the next six matches, CSKA won only two matches, drew arch-rivals Levski 0–0 and lost second place to Lokomotiv Sofia. On 30 March, after two months on the job, Andone resigned, citing family reasons. Former CSKA defender Adalbert Zafirov was put in his place. At the same time, the club turned to Dimitar Penev again, naming him supervisor of the coaching staff. Despite the tumultuous second half of the season, CSKA managed to finish at second place in the table, behind champions Litex, and prepared to enter the third qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.

=== 2010s ===

In the summer of 2010, the club hired Pavel Dochev as head coach, but after a string of unsatisfactory results, including a 0–1 loss to Levski Sofia and a 1–2 loss to Chernomorets Burgas, he was fired. His place was taken by the relatively unknown Macedonian manager Gjore Jovanovski, who kept his job for just three months before being replaced by his assistant Milen Radukanov. Under Radukanov, CSKA won the 2011 Bulgarian Cup and the Bulgarian SuperCup, beating league champions Litex Lovech 3–1.

CSKA started 2011–12 with eight-straight league victories, but after a 1–2 defeat against Slavia Sofia and a 0–0 draw against Cherno More Varna, Radukanov was unexpectedly fired by chairman Dimitar Borisov. Dimitar Penev was appointed as a temporary manager with Adalbert Zafirov as his assistant. In the spring, Stoycho Mladenov was again hired as head coach, and he led the club to a second-place league finish, a single point behind champions Ludogorets Razgrad after losing on the final day of the season.

CSKA began the season by being surprisingly eliminated from international football by Slovenian side Mura 05. While the first leg in Slovenia ended in a 0–0 draw, a 1–1 tie at home eliminated the &quot;Reds&quot; from the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League in the second qualifying round. The start of the domestic championship was unimpressive as well –- a 0–1 loss to Litex, in which the club had no right to use its new signings due to administrative restrictions. However, in the middle of the autumn half of the season, CSKA achieved some significant wins, defeating Levski 1–0 in the Eternal Derby and eliminating Ludogorets Razgrad in the round of 32 of the Bulgarian Cup.

In late December 2012, head coach Stoycho Mladenov was abruptly fired by the club owners for &quot;disciplinary&quot; reasons, and Miodrag Ješić was appointed in his place. During the winter transfer window, CSKA made several signings, such as Bulgarian internationals Martin Kamburov and Spas Delev, in addition to South-American players Marcinho and Ignacio Varela. After managing the team for only two matches in the spring, Ješić was sacked and replaced by fan favourite Milen Radukanov, with whom the club managed to finish the season with the bronze medals.

In June 2013, former FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Hristo Stoichkov was released from Litex Lovech to replace Radukanov on the bench, but the poor financial condition of the club forced him to leave shortly after his arrival without even having signed a contract. Most of the key players left CSKA while speculations about the club&#x27;s bankruptcy circled in the media. After the serious financial problems led to CSKA&#x27;s withdrawal from the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, igniting multiple fan protests, the club was ultimately declared for sale. On 10 July 2013, it was officially purchased by the Red Champions Group, a union of businessmen and club legends. The leader of the group was Aleksandar Tomov, former club president widely blamed for CSKA&#x27;s financial crisis in 2008. Stoycho Mladenov was hired back as manager by the new owners.

The club made several major signings for the new season, bringing in former team captains Valentin Iliev, Emil Gargorov and Todor Yanchev. Algeria&#x27;s national goalkeeper Rais M&#x27;Bolhi and ex-Premier League stars Mamady Sidibé and Martin Petrov were also brought on board. On 19 October 2013, the reborn CSKA crushed city rivals Levski 3–0 and were given the nickname &quot;The Phoenixes&quot;. By the end of the season, CSKA smashed Levski three more times and finished in second place, behind Ludogorets Razgrad.

On 21 March 2014, as part of the plan to reduce debt and make the club&#x27;s finances more transparent, CSKA became the first club from Eastern Europe to be publicly traded by listing itself on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.

Before the start of the new season, a few key players were no longer part of the club. Goalkeeper Raïs M&#x27;Bolhi was transferred to Major League Soccer (MLS) side Philadelphia Union after an impressive performance at the 2014 FIFA World Cup; young talent Ivaylo Chochev joined Palermo; club legends Martin Petrov and Todor Yanchev retired; and the team&#x27;s leading scorer, Emil Gargorov, left due to conflict with the managing board. CSKA were surprisingly eliminated by the Moldovan side Zimbru Chișinău in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League&#x27;s second qualifying round, but performed well in the domestic league during the first half of the season, beating rivals Levski twice more and being on the top of the table ahead of Ludogorets before the winter break. However, after the season resumed, CSKA lost three-straight matches without scoring a goal, prompting the resignation of head coach Stoycho Mladenov. Former team captain and youth team&#x27;s coach Galin Ivanov was appointed as the new head coach, but after five more goalless matches, he was replaced by European football legend Lyuboslav Penev, a move widely praised by fans.

On 2 April, CSKA club president Aleksandar Tomov transferred his controlling block of shares to Milko Georgiev and Borislav Lazarov, with club supporters intending to find a new owner and major sponsors capable of paying off the club&#x27;s numerous debts. On 24 April, it was officially announced the club&#x27;s new controlling owner would be the corporation Finance Marketing Company Ltd. CSKA finished the season in fifth position, but due to the unfunded debts, the BFU refused to issue the club a license for A Group for the upcoming season, instead sending the club to the South-Western V group, the third tier of Bulgarian football.

On 24 June 2015, businessman Grisha Ganchev announced he would be the new owner of CSKA. Club legend Plamen Markov and famous former footballer Hristo Yanev were appointed as sports director and head coach respectively. Yanev claimed he wants to form a squad consisting entirely of Bulgarian players.

On 25 May 2016, CSKA Sofia won the 2015–16 Bulgarian Cup, becoming the first third-division club to record such an achievement. In the final, CSKA defeated Montana 1–0 to lift the cup for the 20th time in club history.

On 27 May 2016, the legal firm that represented PFC Chavdar Etropole, &quot;PFC Chavdar EAD&quot;, was renamed to &quot;PFC CSKA-1948 AD&quot;. On 6 June 2016, the legal firm which representedb Litex Lovech, &quot;PFC Litex-Lovech AD&quot;, was renamed to &quot;PFC CSKA-Sofia EAD&quot;, in order for the club to use PFC Litex Lovech&#x27;s professional license to apply for the reformed First League, with &quot;PFC CSKA-1948 AD&quot; being written in as its owner. The shift was made because the old legal firm, &quot;PFC CSKA AD&quot;, was not issued a professional license, and later went bankrupted and ceased operations as of 9 September 2016. Litex Lovech later began playing in the Third League, taking the place of Botev Lukovit.

Following a series of unfavourable results in the championship, Hristo Yanev resigned as head coach. The following week, the son of former Romanian football legend Anghel Iordănescu, Edward Iordănescu, was appointed as head coach. However, on 27 November, following a 1–1 home draw against Vereya, he resigned as head coach.

In September 2017, the club officially announced a sponsorship with Mtel, the largest telecommunications company in Bulgaria. A sponsorship contract was also signed with Bulgarian online gambling company WinBet.

On 11 October 2018, after three auctions, the company holding PFC CSKA-Sofia EAD bought the CSKA Sofia EAD brand, becoming officially the successor of the original club. The transaction was made for the amount of €4 million, thus giving legitimacy to the new entity, even though it had already been accepted by most supporters and ex-legends of the club as the successor of the original club.

=== 2020s ===
The beginning of the decade marked CSKA&#x27;s return to the European stage. The club earned a place in the group stage of a European tournament for the first time in ten years after eliminating FC Basel in the playoffs of the 2020-21 Europa League.

Stoycho Mladenov was appointed as head coach for the fifth time in club history in the summer of 2021, replacing Lyuboslav Penev. After defeating FK Liepāja, NK Osijek, and Viktoria Plzeň in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Europa Conference League, the club reached the group stage.

In April 2022, after it became apparent that the club would not win the title, Mladenov abruptly resigned and was replaced by Alan Pardew, the club&#x27;s technical director, who became the first Englishman ever to manage CSKA.
Pardew, however, would resign two months later following a racist incident where CSKA fans threw bananas at black players during a match against Botev Plovdiv.

For the following 2022-23 season, the club was managed by serbian football legend Saša Ilić, with whom the Reds came tantalizingly close to winning the title, losing it in the final match to rivals Ludogorets by a single point after Ivan Turitsov missed a penalty in the 95th minute.

== Club crest ==

The main element in the current club crest is the red five-pointed star – symbol of glory and power. Red was the colour of the uniform of the Roman legions, associated with love, freedom and aggression. The six oak leaves above the star symbolise strength, endurance and traditions. CSKA&#x27;s name and year of foundation (1948) can be seen below the star, between two Bulgarian flags. The circle form of the crest symbolises infinity and eternity.

After CSKA won its 30th national title in 2005, three golden stars were added to the logo. In 2017, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the club, CSKA introduced an updated chest.

After the merger between Chavdar Sofia and Septemvri Sofia, it was accepted the club&#x27;s home colour would be red. White became the club&#x27;s away colour.

In previous years, black was also used, mainly for away or third kits. Other colours of the CSKA kits that can be seen are grey, yellow, orange and green, but only in rarely occasions and only in the colour scheme of the third kits. In the 2009–10 season, and for the first time in club history, CSKA used gold for their away kits.

After the 2011–12 season in which CSKA used equipment of the Italian company Kappa, from June 2012 the club has new kit supplier, Italian company Legea. The team used the new equipment for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Moscow side Torpedo Moscow, ended 1–2. The kits were sample and they were with a different outfit and a different spot where the team badge was placed. The official presentation of the new kits was before the friendly match against Macedonian side Drita on 14 July 2012 (2–0), played at the Bulgarian Army Stadium.

<text>In the mathematical field of order theory, an element &quot;a&quot; of a partially ordered set with least element 0 is an atom if 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; and there is no &quot;x&quot; such that 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;a&quot;. 

Equivalently, one may define an atom to be an element that is minimal among the non-zero elements, or alternatively an element that covers the least element 0.

==Atomic orderings==
Let &lt;: denote the covering relation in a partially ordered set.

A partially ordered set with a least element 0 is atomic if every element &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0 has an atom &quot;a&quot; below it, that is, there is some &quot;a&quot; such that &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot; :&gt; &quot;0&quot;. Every finite partially ordered set with 0 is atomic, but the set of nonnegative real numbers (ordered in the usual way) is not atomic (and in fact has no atoms).

A partially ordered set is relatively atomic (or &quot;strongly atomic&quot;) if for all &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; there is an element &quot;c&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; &lt;: &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; or, equivalently, if every interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] is atomic. Every relatively atomic partially ordered set with a least element is atomic. Every finite poset is relatively atomic.

A partially ordered set with least element 0 is called atomistic (not to be confused with atomic) if every element is the least upper bound of a set of atoms. The linear order with three elements is not atomistic (see Fig. 2).

Atoms in partially ordered sets are abstract generalizations of singletons in set theory (see Fig. 1). Atomicity (the property of being atomic) provides an abstract generalization in the context of order theory of the ability to select an element from a non-empty set.

==Coatoms==
The terms &quot;coatom&quot;, &quot;coatomic&quot;, and &quot;coatomistic&quot; are defined dually. Thus, in a partially ordered set with greatest element 1, one says that
* a coatom is an element covered by 1,
* the set is coatomic if every &quot;b&quot; &lt; 1 has a coatom &quot;c&quot; above it, and
* the set is coatomistic if every element is the greatest lower bound of a set of coatoms.

<text>Wikispecies is a wiki-based online project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. Its aim is to create a comprehensive open content catalogue of all species; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. Jimmy Wales stated that editors are not required to fax in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience. Wikispecies is available under the GNU Free Documentation License and CC BY-SA 4.0.

Started in September 2004, with biologists around the world invited to contribute, the project had grown to a framework encompassing the Linnaean taxonomy with links to Wikipedia articles on individual species by April 2005.

== History ==
Benedikt Mandl coordinated the efforts of several people who were interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in the early summer of 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted; some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Mandl defined two major tasks:
# Figure out how the contents of the data base would need to be presented—by asking experts, potential non-professional users and comparing that with existing databases
# Figure out how to do the software, which hardware is required and how to cover the costs—by asking experts, looking for fellow volunteers and potential sponsors

Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the Wikimedia Foundation voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged into a sister project of the Wikimedia Foundation on September 14, 2004.
* On October 10, 2006, the project exceeded 75,000 articles.
* On May 20, 2007, the project exceeded 100,000 articles 
* On September 8, 2008, the project exceeded 150,000 articles
* On October 23, 2011, the project reached 300,000 articles.
* On June 16, 2014, the project reached 400,000 articles.
* On January 7, 2017, the project reached 500,000 articles.
* On October 30, 2018, the project reached 600,000 articles, and a total of 1.12 million pages.
* On December 8, 2019, the project reached 700,000 articles, and a total of 1.33 million pages.
* On January 8, 2021, the project reached 750,000 articles, and a total of 1.5 million pages.
* On April 16, 2022, the project reached 800,000 articles, and a total of 1.67 million pages.
* On September 17, 2023, the project reached 850,000 articles, and a total of 1.87 million pages.
* On January 17, 2025, the project reached 900,000 articles, and a total of 2.03 million pages.

As a database for taxonomy and nomenclature, Wikispecies comprises taxon pages, and additionally pages about synonyms, taxon authorities, taxonomical publications, type material, and institutions or repositories holding type specimen.

<text>Geoffrey Edward Harvey Grigson (2 March 1905 – 25 November 1985) was a British poet, writer, editor, critic, exhibition curator, anthologist and naturalist. In the 1930s he was editor of the influential magazine &quot;New Verse&quot;, and went on to produce 13 collections of his own poetry, as well as compiling numerous anthologies, among many published works on subjects including art, travel and the countryside. Grigson exhibited in the London International Surrealist Exhibition at New Burlington Galleries in 1936, and in 1946 co-founded the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Grigson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Crest on the Silver&quot; was published in 1950. At various times he was involved in teaching, journalism and broadcasting. Fiercely combative, he made many literary enemies.

==Life and work==
Grigson was born at the vicarage in Pelynt, a village near Looe in Cornwall. His childhood in rural Cornwall had a significant influence on his poetry and writing. As a boy, his love of objects of nature (plants, bones and stones) was sparked at the house of family friends at Polperro who were painters and amateur naturalists. He was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, and at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.

=== Poet and editor ===
After graduating from Oxford University, Grigson took a job at the London office of the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, from where he moved on to become literary editor of the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. He first came to prominence in the 1930s as a poet, then as editor from 1933 to 1939 of the poetry magazine &quot;New Verse&quot;. Among important works by many influential poets — notably Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender, Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, Paul Éluard and Grigson himself — &quot;New Verse&quot; featured concrete poetry by the sculptor Alberto Giacometti (translated by David Gascoyne) and folk poetry from tribal villages of the Jagdalpür Tahsil district of Bastar State, Chhattisgarh, transcribed from the Halbi language by Grigson&#x27;s brother Wilfrid Grigson. During this period, Grigson published some of his own poetry under the pseudonym Martin Boldero. An anthology of poems that appeared in the first 30 issues of &quot;New Verse&quot; was published in hardback by Faber &amp; Faber in 1939, and re-published in 1942; the second edition states that the first &quot;came out on the day war was declared&quot;.

During World War II, Grigson worked in the editorial department of the BBC Monitoring Service at Wood Norton near Evesham, Worcestershire, and as a talks producer for the BBC at Bristol.

=== Art curator ===
In 1946, Grigson was one of the founders of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, together with Roland Penrose, Herbert Read, Peter Watson and Peter Gregory. In 1951, Grigson curated an exhibition of drawings and watercolours drawn from the British Council Collection, which for three decades toured worldwide to 57 art galleries and museums. The exhibition consisted of more than 100 works, including those of John Craxton, Barbara Hepworth, Augustus John, Wyndham Lewis, Henry Moore, Paul Nash, Ben Nicholson, John Piper, and Graham Sutherland.

=== Art critic and author ===
Grigson was a noted critic, reviewer (for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; in particular), and compiler of numerous poetry anthologies. He published 13 collections of poetry, and wrote on a variety of subjects, including the English countryside, botany, travel, and especially art –– with books on Wyndham Lewis, Henry Moore, and most notably, Samuel Palmer.

In 1951, he was General Editor of the 13-volume &quot;About Britain&quot; series of regional guidebooks published by William Collins to coincide with the Festival of Britain. After the repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, at the initiative of Stephen Spender, Grigson joined a group of British writers and artists who applied for visas to visit dissidents in Hungary. The visas were refused.

=== Champion and scholar of Samuel Palmer ===
Grigson&#x27;s &quot;Samuel Palmer: The Visionary Years&quot; (1947), an aptly poetic chronicle of the artist&#x27;s early life influences and experiences, which contained 68 photo illustrations, introduced to a broad audience the early works of one of England&#x27;s greatest Romantic painters. Grigson&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Samuel Palmer&#x27;s Valley of Vision&quot; (1960), included a selection of the artist&#x27;s own writings and an additional 48 plates. Both books featured a number of previously unpublished paintings, drawings, and sketches. They established Grigson as the foremost authority on Palmer&#x27;s revered &quot;Shoreham Period&quot;, and helped trigger a surge of interest in Palmer&#x27;s youthful, ecstatic, fantastical depictions (during a time of post-war riots and Industrial Revolution) of Nature&#x27;s abundance, in an idyllic Kentish countryside.

Controversially, these books also caught the attention of famous art forger Tom Keating, who used their illustrations as models for a series of Palmer fakes that he did in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. In 1976, along with Palmer experts from the Ashmolean, Fitzwilliam, Tate, and British Museums, Grigson helped &quot;Times&quot; reporter Geraldine Norman confirm that 13 suspect Palmers that had come on the market over the previous decade were forgeries. At Keating&#x27;s 1979 art fraud trial at the Old Bailey, in his searing testimony on the credulity of the Bond Street art merchants who bought and sold some of the fake Palmers, contentious art critic Brian Sewell referred to a personal letter in Grigson&#x27;s &quot;The Visionary Years&quot; that made ridiculous a key element of the provenance they had proffered, much to the delight of Keating&#x27;s defence barrister.

In the catalogue for a major retrospective held by the British Museum and The Metropolitan Museum of Art on the bicentenary of Palmer&#x27;s birth (2005), Colin Harrison, curator at the Ashmolean Museum, in his essay on the artist&#x27;s rediscovery, credited Grigson&#x27;s 1947 book with effectively establishing a canon of Palmer&#x27;s early work.

=== Final years ===
Grigson was the castaway featured in an edition of Roy Plomley&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4 first broadcast on 16 October 1982 (his favourite music track was &quot;She Never Told Her Love&quot; by Franz Joseph Haydn, his book choice was &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and his luxury item: &quot;pâté de foie gras&quot;). In 1984, Grigson was interviewed by Hermione Lee in an edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Book Four&quot;.

Grigson in his later life lived partly in Wiltshire, south-west England, and partly in a cave house in Trôo, a troglodyte village in the Loir-et-Cher département in France, which features in his poetry. He died in 1985 in Broad Town, Wiltshire, where he is buried in the churchyard of Christ Church.

==Family==
Born in 1905, Grigson was the youngest of seven sons of Canon William Shuckforth Grigson (1845–1930), a Norfolk clergyman who had settled in Cornwall as vicar of Pelynt, and Mary Beatrice Boldero, herself the daughter of a clergyman. The inscription on his father&#x27;s slate headstone in Pelynt Churchyard is the work of Eric Gill, 1931. Five of Grigson&#x27;s six brothers died serving in the First and Second World Wars, among them John Grigson. This was one of the highest rates of mortality suffered by any British family during the conflicts of the 20th century. Grigson&#x27;s surviving brother, Wilfrid Grigson, was killed in an air crash in 1948 while serving as a post-Partition official in Pakistan.

Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s first wife was Frances Franklin Galt (who died in 1937 of tuberculosis). With her, he founded the poetry magazine &quot;New Verse&quot;. They had one daughter, Caroline (who married designer Colin Banks). With his second wife, Berta Emma Kunert, Grigson had two children, Anna and Lionel Grigson. Following divorce from his second wife, Grigson married Jane Grigson, &quot;née&quot; McIntire (1928–90). Their daughter is Sophie Grigson. Among Grigson&#x27;s grandchildren is the political scientist Giacomo Benedetto.

==Honours and legacy==
Described in 1963 by G. S. Fraser as &quot;one of the most important figures in the history of English taste in our time&quot;, Grigson was awarded the Duff Cooper Prize for his 1971 volume of poetry &quot;Discoveries of Bones and Stones&quot;. A collection of tributes entitled &quot;Grigson at Eighty&quot;, compiled by R. M. Healey (Cambridge: Rampant Lions Press), was published in 1985, the year of his death. In 2005, to mark the centenary of Grigson&#x27;s birth a conference was held at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.

In 2007, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester presented the exhibition &quot;Poets in the Landscape: The Romantic Spirit in British Art&quot;. The exhibition explored &quot;the creative links between poetry, the pastoral vision and British art in the work of Romantic artists of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the Neo-Romantic artists of the mid-20th century&quot;, with exhibits of Grigson&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Eye&quot;, featuring lithographs by John Craxton, and copies of &quot;New Verse&quot;.

In 2017, the British Museum presented a major exhibition of British landscape paintings from the century following the death of J. M. W. Turner. The exhibition title was &quot;borrowed from the poet and critic Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s 1949 collection of essays &quot;Places of the Mind&quot;&quot;, and, in doing so, &quot;acknowledges how every landscape drawing is a construct of the mind and imagination of its creator&quot;.

<text>Data hierarchy refers to the systematic organization of data, often in a hierarchical form. Data organization involves characters, fields, records, files and so on. This concept is a starting point when trying to see what makes up data and whether data has a structure. For example, how does a person make sense of data such as &#x27;employee&#x27;, &#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;department&#x27;, &#x27;Marcy Smith&#x27;, &#x27;Sales Department&#x27; and so on, assuming that they are all related? One way to understand them is to see these terms as smaller or larger components in a hierarchy. One might say that Marcy Smith is one of the employees in the Sales Department, or an example of an employee in that Department. The data we want to capture about all our employees, and not just Marcy, is the name, ID number, address etc.

== Purpose of the data hierarchy ==
&quot;Data hierarchy&quot; is a basic concept in data and database theory and helps to show the relationships between smaller and larger components in a database or data file. It is used to give a better sense of understanding about the components of data and how they are related.

It is particularly important in databases with referential integrity, third normal form, or perfect key. &quot;Data hierarchy&quot; is the result of proper arrangement of data without redundancy. Avoiding redundancy eventually leads to proper &quot;data hierarchy&quot; representing the relationship between data, and revealing its relational structure.

== Components of the data hierarchy ==
The components of the data hierarchy are listed below.

A data field holds a single fact or attribute of an entity. Consider a date field, e.g. &quot;19 September 2004&quot;. This can be treated as a single date field (e.g. birthdate), or three fields, namely, day of month, month and year.

A record is a collection of related fields. An Employee record may contain a name field(s), address fields, birthdate field and so on.

A file is a collection of related records. If there are 100 employees, then each employee would have a record (e.g. called Employee Personal Details record) and the collection of 100 such records would constitute a file (in this case, called Employee Personal Details file).

Files are integrated into a database. This is done using a Database Management System. If there are other facets of employee data that we wish to capture, then other files such as Employee Training History file and Employee Work History file could be created as well.

== Illustration of the data hierarchy ==
An illustration of the above description is shown in this diagram below:

The following terms are for better clarity. With reference to the example in the above diagram:

Data field label = Employee Name or EMP_NAME

Data field value = Jeffrey Tan

The above description is a view of data as understood by a user e.g. a person working in Human Resource Department.

The above structure can be seen in the hierarchical model, which is one way to organize data in a database.

In terms of data storage, data fields are made of bytes and these in turn are made up of bits.

<text>&quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; () literally &quot;Wait, Please&quot; in Japanese, is a ballad by the progressive rock band King Crimson. Featuring vocals by Adrian Belew, it was released as the first single from the album &quot;Discipline&quot; (1981). In the UK, the single just missed the chart. 

&quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; evolved out of a guitar riff played by Robert Fripp during 1980 tour rehearsals for Fripp&#x27;s short-lived new wave band The League of Gentlemen. That riff, in turn, had similarities to Fripp&#x27;s song &quot;North Star&quot;, which had appeared on his 1979 album &quot;Exposure&quot; (with vocals, and lyrics, by Daryl Hall). The League of Gentlemen practiced playing along with Fripp; the rehearsal recording was later posted online by Discipline Global Mobile archivist Alex R. &quot;Stormy&quot; Mundy, who dubbed the resulting song &quot;Northa Kudasai&quot; to reflect its intermediate state.

While Belew was crafting material for &quot;Discipline&quot;, Fripp presented him with the chord progression to &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; on guitar. Belew described this as &quot;a breakthrough&quot; moment, as he had previously struggled to craft suitable material for the band. He subsequently created a slide guitar part and some lyrics to accompany the composition.

For the 1989 Definitive Edition remaster of &quot;Discipline&quot;, the song was remixed to remove the Frippertronics parts that dotted the original 1981 version. The 30th and 35th anniversary editions, meanwhile, contain both mixes of the song: the 1989 version is kept as track three, while the 1981 version (billed as an &quot;Alternative Version&quot;) is featured at the end of the album as a bonus track.

==Covers==
The short-lived jazz group Crimson Jazz Trio, founded by former King Crimson drummer Ian Wallace to play instrumental jazz versions of King Crimson songs, included &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; on their first album, &quot;The King Crimson Songbook, Volume One&quot; (2005). Kurt Elling covered the song as the opening track of his 2011 album &quot;The Gate&quot;. 

On 20 April 2011, k.d. lang and her band the Siss Boom Bang covered the song as part of her concert at the BBC Radio Theater. The audio and video of that performance were broadcast on 21 April 2011 on BBC Radio 2. Lang noted in her introduction to the song that it was influential on the sound of her fifth album, &quot;Ingenue.&quot;

The Levin Brothers (keyboardist/arranger Pete Levin and King Crimson bassist Tony Levin) included an instrumental version of &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; on their 2014 album &quot;Levin Brothers.&quot;

<text>Sélestat (; Alsatian: &quot;Schlettstàdt&quot;; German: &quot;Schlettstadt&quot;) is a commune in the Grand Est region of France. An administrative division (sous-préfecture) of the Bas-Rhin department, the town lies on the Ill river, from the Rhine and the German border. Sélestat is located between the largest communes of Alsace, Strasbourg and Mulhouse.

In 2019, Sélestat had a total population of 19,242. The Humanist Library of Sélestat is located there.

== Name ==

The present name of the town is a Frenchification of the original Germanic name. It appeared soon after the French conquest in the 17th century. The town is called &quot;Schlettstàdt&quot; () in Alsatian and () in German.

Sélestat was first mentioned in 727 as &quot;Sclastat&quot;. It was mentioned as &quot;Scalistati&quot; in 775, as &quot;Slectistat&quot; in 881, as &quot;Sclezistat&quot; in 884 and as &quot;Slezestat&quot; in 1095. The current German name, &quot;Schlettstadt&quot;, appeared in 1310, although various spellings can be noticed on posterior documents, such as &quot;Schlestat&quot;, &quot;Schletstat&quot; and &quot;Schlettstat&quot;. The French administration used various forms from the 17th to the 19th century, such as Frenchified (&quot;Sélestat&quot;, &quot;Sélestadt&quot;) and Germanic (&quot;Schlestadt&quot;, &quot;Schelestadt&quot;). The town was officially known as &quot;Schlettstadt&quot; between 1871 and 1919, when Alsace was part of the German Empire. Since 1920, the town&#x27;s French name is fixed as Sélestat.

The origin of the name &quot;Schlettstadt&quot; is unclear. It probably derives from Germanic words &quot;slade&quot; or &quot;sclade&quot; meaning &quot;marshes&quot;, and &quot;stat&quot; for &quot;city&quot;. Sélestat would then be a &quot;city in the marshes&quot;, a reference to its position in the Grand Ried, a vast area subject to flooding that stretches over the centre of Alsace. &quot;Stat&quot; could also mean &quot;area&quot; rather than &quot;city&quot;.

A popular myth explains that the town takes its name from a dragon called &quot;Schletto&quot; that founded the settlement after opening up the nearby Lièpvre valley in the Vosges mountains.

== History ==

=== Birth of the town ===

Sélestat was first mentioned in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings provide evidence of human settlement during the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might have already been a port on the river Ill.

When Sélestat started to appear in written documents in the 8th century, it may have been a market town or simply a village populated by fishermen and farmers. The area was part of the estate of Eberhard, a member of the Alsatian ducal family, who donated it to Murbach Abbey at the end of his life. In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in Sélestat, which indicates that the town must have had enough appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops.

In the 1080s, Sélestat was the property of Hildegard von Eguisheim, mother of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia, the first member of the House of Hohenstaufen. Hildegard transformed the place into a religious centre when she founded St. Faith&#x27;s Church, which she gave to the Benedictines of Conques Abbey. Monks from Conques opened a priory next to the church in 1092. The House of Hohenstaufen quickly became the leading dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, which came to the imperial throne in 1152. Being under their protection, the priory of Sélestat strongly influenced local life. Even though Sélestat constituted a distinct parish, its priest had only limited power and the Benedictine prior was the true head of the municipality. At the end of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen dynasty gradually lost power and as a result the priory started to decline. The citizens used this opportunity to reduce the prior&#x27;s dominance and secure the power of their parish. They started to build a new parish church in the 1220s. St. George&#x27;s Church was designed in Gothic style and was significantly larger than St. Faith&#x27;s Church, another way to signify the end of Benedictine hegemony.

=== Free imperial city ===

Frederick II, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, realised that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities to keep their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and Sélestat became one of them in 1217. Under the new status Sélestat was able to build city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted Sélestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the new status favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace were afraid that they would not be defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in Sélestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.

The Benedictine priory was closed in 1424 after many years of decline. It had long lost its power to the local nobility that were gradually replaced by the bourgeoisie in the mid-14th century. Nevertheless, Sélestat remained a religious centre even after the closing of the priory. Convents were established in the 13th century by Dominicans, Knights Hospitaller and Franciscans. Several abbeys located outside of the town also had a residence in town. At the beginning of the 16th century, Sélestat was a noted centre of Renaissance humanism thanks to its celebrated Latin school. Reformers Beatus Rhenanus and Martin Bucer were among the school&#x27;s alumni. This school helped spread Protestant ideas among the population, although the local authorities remained faithful to Rome. Erasmus of Rotterdam visited Sélestat four times between 1515 and 1522.

Being a free city, Sélestat attracted settlers from the region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At the end of the Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.

=== Decline ===

The decline of the town started in the 1520s, when the humanist school lost its former influence. The troubles surrounding the Protestant Reformation brought instability and unrest to the region. The town experienced the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525 and its convents were sacked by a mob in 1534. During the same period Sélestat lost its pre-eminence in the Decapolis because the city of Mulhouse left the alliance in 1515 and was replaced by Landau in 1521, moving the geographical centre of the alliance to the north.

During the 17th century, Alsace was one of the main battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They surrendered the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.

At first, Sélestat was a major strategic stronghold for the French. Located near the Rhine, it controlled the access to the Vosges mountains and the rest of France. Vauban, the foremost military architect at that time, rebuilt the town walls between 1675 and 1691. However, after the conquest of Strasbourg in 1681 Sélestat lost much of its strategic importance, as Strasbourg was better located. But it remained a garrison town, and the troops stationed there helped to improve the faltering local economy. Although Protestantism was not forbidden in Alsace, French authorities largely encouraged Catholicism and opened three new convents in Sélestat. Jews were expelled from the town in 1642. During the French Revolution the population was extremely conservative and opposed to change. The new territorial organisation confirmed the decline of the town, which did not become a prefecture and was not distinguished as a subprefecture until 1806, when it replaced Barr in that capacity. Sélestat suffered from the Napoleonic wars as it was besieged and bombed by the Bavarians in 1814 and blockaded by a German coalition in 1815.

=== Since 1815 ===

Industry appeared very early in Sélestat. The town had already several factories at the beginning of the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.

Sélestat became French again after the First World War, during which almost a thousand inhabitants died. Following the Battle of France of the Second World War, it was annexed by Nazi Germany. Its liberation took three months and ended in February 1945. The town is a recipient of the &quot;Croix de guerre&quot; of 1914–1918 and 1939–1945. Sélestat has experienced steady demographic and economic growth since 1945. Its population almost doubled between 1946 and 1999 and two industrial parks were built to accommodate new large factories. The service industry has enriched the town&#x27;s economy since the 1970s with a large number of small businesses.

South of the town, at , a large broadcasting facility was used for transmitting on 1161 kHz and 1278 kHz in the medium-wave range. It was opened in 1948 and ceased to emit on 1 January 2016.

== Governance ==

Sélestat is one of the six subprefectures of the Bas-Rhin departement. As such it is at the head of the Sélestat-Erstein arrondissement. Sélestat is also the administrative centre of a canton including 28 other communes which primarily serve as a constituency for local elections. Sélestat is part of the 5th Bas-Rhin constituency for national elections. Since 2002, the Member of the National Assembly for the constituency has been the Republican Antoine Herth.

Sélestat is a member of a federation of communes with shared competencies: the Communauté de communes de Sélestat. Sélestat is its main town, and it includes 11 neighbouring villages. It was created in 1995 to replace an older but similar structure founded in 1969. Sélestat is also the seat of the Central Alsace &quot;pays&quot;, a structure aiming at developing the area.

The town has had a council since 1292, when it was granted a constitution under the Holy Roman Empire. The constitution shaped the local political system until the French Revolution of 1789. Since then, the town has been administered as all the other communes of France. Its council currently comprises 33 councillors, whose number is defined by law according to the size of the population. The town also has a mayor elected by the councillors.

Alsace in general is a stronghold of the French right. The main French right-wing party, The Republicans, currently holds a large majority in the council (26 councillors). Marcel Bauer, who has been mayor since 2001, is also a member of that party. Voters in Sélestat generally favour right-wing candidates at other elections as well, although Sélestat was governed by the Socialist Party between 1989 and 2001.

== Geography ==

Sélestat is located at the very centre of Alsace, near the limit separating the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments, which traditionally correspond to Lower and Upper Alsace, respectively. The town is located between Strasbourg and Mulhouse, the first being north and the latter south of the city. Sélestat is also located between Obernai () and Colmar (). On the other side of the Rhine, Freiburg im Breisgau is around distant.

Sélestat lies on the Alsace plains, a narrow, very fertile area that stretches between the Rhine and the Vosges mountains. The Ill flows parallel to the Rhine and crosses Sélestat. This river frequently branches and swells, making the area very wet and subject to flooding. Sélestat is only from the Vosges, at the opening of one of the rare valleys crossing the mountain range and providing a connection to the rest of France. This valley corresponds to the course of the Giessen, a long tributary of the Ill. In contrast to the Ill, which has a constant annual flow, the Giessen is a mountain river subject to sudden increases in the water level, especially during the spring thaw period. The Giessen passes north of the town and meets the Ill several kilometers to the east, in Ebersmunster.

The town itself is built on the Giessen alluvial fan so it is slightly higher than the rest of the Alsace plains. Much of its territory is however located on areas liable to flooding. Such areas are mostly located inside the Illwald natural reserve and comprise both forests and meadows. There the Ill forms more than of waterways.

== Transport ==
Despite its small size, Sélestat is well connected to transport networks. Alsace as a whole, being part of the economic heart of Europe, has a high road and railway density.

The town is served by the A35 autoroute, a motorway that crosses Alsace north to south, connecting Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse. Further south it connects to the Swiss A3 motorway, and further north to the German B9 highway. Taken together, these three roads connect the Netherlands to Austria. Sélestat is also located at one of the seven crossings of the Vosges mountains, connecting Lorraine to Alsace and Germany.

Sélestat train station was opened in 1840, which makes it one of the oldest in France. It lies on the Strasbourg–Basel railway, which also serves Colmar, Mulhouse and Saint-Louis. Sélestat is at the terminus of two local railways that are partly closed: Sélestat-Lesseux, now ending in Lièpvre, and Sélestat-Saverne, now ending in Molsheim. The former railway runs towards the west through the Vosges, while the latter runs towards the northwest. A third local line, Sélestat-Sundhouse, closed in 1953. Although one of the oldest in France, the Strasbourg-Basel railway allows high speed travel of () because it is very rectilinear and crosses a very flat landscape. Sélestat is served by all regional trains between Strasbourg and Basel (one train in each direction every hour on weekdays). Local trains also run between Sélestat and Molsheim, Sélestat and Strasbourg and Sélestat and Barr. Sélestat is served by a Paris-Colmar TGV every day in each direction, by Strasbourg-Nice and Strasbourg-Cerbère Intercités in the summer, and by EuroCity trains connecting Zürich to Brussels and Basel to Luxembourg.

SNCF and the Bas-Rhin council operate coach lines between Sélestat and Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, Ribeauvillé, Marckolsheim, Sundhouse and Villé. The council also arranges for seasonal connections with Haut-Kœnigsbourg castle and Europa Park.

Sélestat and its communauté de communes have their own local bus network, the &quot;Transport intercommunal de Sélestat&quot; (TIS). It comprises two lines, one connecting Châtenois to Ebersheim, and the other Scherwiller to Muttersholtz. These two lines make several stops in Sélestat proper, which is at the centre of the network.

== Demography ==

, Sélestat had 19,242 inhabitants. It is the 8th most populated commune in Alsace, having reached its maximum population in 2006, with 19,459 inhabitants. The oldest preserved birth registries of the town&#x27;s Catholic parish go back to the year 1608; the oldest vital records (&quot;état civil&quot;) go back to the year 1793.

Sélestat was one of the largest towns in the region from the Middle Ages until the beginning of the 19th century. In 1801, it was still the third most populous in Alsace behind Strasbourg and Colmar. It then had 7,375 inhabitants, a slightly higher figure than for Mulhouse (7,197) and Haguenau (7,009). Through the 19th century, Sélestat did not take advantage of industrialisation and rural exodus because its city wall and military function prevented urban growth. It reached its overpopulation threshold around 1830, with around 10,000 inhabitants living on only . Only after the Second World War did Sélestat experience significant demographic growth, almost doubling its population in 50 years. However, this growth was not strong enough for Sélestat to recover its previous rank.

The demographic growth that occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were on the margins of the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.

The population of Sélestat is relatively young, 36.2% of the population were under 30 in 2017 (France: 35.7%) and the percentage of people over 60 years old (23.6%) was lower than the national (25.5%) figure. Sélestat has a significant proportion of people between 15 and 44 (39.7%, compared to 36.4% for all of France) because it attracts a large number of young actives and couples starting a family. As other towns in the region, such as Saverne, Haguenau and Molsheim, it welcomes young adults and encourages them to settle in the surrounding villages.

At the end of 2015, Sélestat had 2,142 businesses, most of them (1,441) in the tertiary sector. A large share were small businesses; only 9% had more than 10 employees. Sélestat is a retail and services centre for the whole Central Alsace, with a large shopping park and administrative and educational institutions. Industry is nonetheless represented by some large firms, such as the &quot;Société alsacienne de meubles&quot;, which builds kitchens and bathrooms under a Schmidt and Cuisinella franchise, Amcor (aluminium packaging), Daramic (battery separators), Albany (gauzes for the printing industry), Wanzl (warehouse material), and DHJ (textiles).

Most of the large factories are in an industrial estate located south of the town centre. Created in the 1930s, it covers a site of . The newer commercial estate north of the town was developed in the 1970s and is dedicated to retail and cottage industry. It covers . The town centre is also an important shopping area with more than 200 businesses.

== Sights and culture ==
In terms of architecture the city has the third largest cultural heritage after Strasbourg and Colmar. Sélestat has 35 listed buildings and 119 additional sites that are indexed in the French list of cultural heritage monuments.

=== Museums ===

The Humanist Library displays one of the oldest and most homogeneous collections of medieval manuscripts and Renaissance books in Europe. Its core is the still almost intact library of Beatus Rhenanus, which was bequeathed to the city and has been maintained by it ever since. The institution also holds the books that belonged to the Latin school of Sélestat, at which Rhenanus and many other reformers were educated around 1500. In 2011, the library has been inscribed in the Unesco&#x27;s Memory of the World Register.

The library is open to both researchers and tourists, with an exhibition displaying some of its most noteworthy items: an 8th-century lectionary, the first books printed in Alsace, a copy of the &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot; where the oldest mention of America can be found, and a 1521 document which contains the oldest record of a Christmas tree.

Sélestat also has a museum dedicated to bread and baking and it is the seat of the FRAC d&#x27;Alsace, a regional institution whose aim is to collect contemporary works of art (see below, Cultural institutions and events). These works are regularly part of temporary exhibits in Sélestat and other places in Alsace. FRAC possesses works by Aurélie Nemours, Olivier Debré, Mario Merz and Panamarenko, among other artists.

=== Religious architecture ===

Sélestat has two large and remarkable churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith&#x27;s Church is the oldest and a prime example of Romanesque architecture. Its design is related to similar buildings both in the Rhine region and in Lorraine. It was built during the second half of the 12th century to replace an earlier building. The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found during this work. It is often attributed to Hildegard of Eguisheim, founder of the church, and is now displayed in a crypt.

St. George&#x27;s Church has always served as the main parish church. It is often referred to as &quot;the cathedral&quot; because of its size, but it has never been the seat of a diocese. Its construction started soon after 1200 and was completed at the beginning of the 15th century. Its design is pure Gothic, save for a Romanesque side portal. The choir, the last part to be completed, is the most remarkable element. It is illuminated by 288 stained glass panels, of which 55 date from the 15th century.

Most of the convents of the town have disappeared; the Dominican convent is the only one to have retained much of its original appearance. It was built in the 13th century and still has its church and cloister. The Franciscan convent was completely destroyed, apart from the choir of its church, which now serves as a Protestant church. Sélestat also has an old granary that belonged to the Benedictine priory, and a 16th-century commandery built by the Knights Hospitaller.

The synagogue was built in 1890. Its architecture is typical of the region, with a square shape and discreet neo-romanesque ornaments. Its cupola was destroyed in 1940 by the Nazis and never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence.

=== Civil and military architecture ===

The old town comprises a large number of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The &quot;quai des Tanneurs&quot; (&quot;tanners&#x27; quay&quot;) is one of the most picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, &quot;rue des Oies&quot; (&quot;geese street&quot;) and &quot;rue des Veaux&quot; (&quot;calf street&quot;), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.

Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) date from the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are characteristic of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey and it has a large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius&#x27;s architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.
The German period (1871–1918) left some examples of Wilhelminism in the city&#x27;s architecture. This prestige-oriented style is a mixture of various earlier styles, including Romanesque, Gothic and neoclassical. Noteworthy are the post office (1884), the courthouse (1900), the lycée Koeberlé (1913) and the water tower (1906). The latter (height: ) was largely inspired by the water tower in Deventer, Netherlands.

The medieval city walls, built in several stages between the 13th and the 16th century, were torn down after the French annexation in the 17th century. However, four towers escaped destruction. The &quot;Tour des Sorcières&quot; (&quot;witches&#x27; tower&quot;), which served as a gate and a jail, is the tallest. The &quot;Tour de l&#x27;Horloge&quot; (&quot;clock tower&quot;) was also originally part of a gate. The clock and the elaborate roof were added in 1614. Two much smaller towers can also be seen, one near the Ill river and another integrated into a later house. All these remains date from the 13th century.

New walls were built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They were in their turn destroyed in 1874. Only small portions survive: two bastions and the &quot;Porte de Strasbourg&quot; (&quot;Strasbourg gate&quot;), a good example of French architecture under Louis XIV. Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is a fine example of Gothic architecture.

=== Municipal archive ===
The municipal archive (&quot;archives municipales&quot;) of Sélestat owns and exhibits numerous ancient documents, among which royal charters dating back to the 13th century and, most famously, the register dated from 1521 containing the first written mention of the Christmas tree.

=== Illwald forest ===

The Illwald forest was designated a regional nature reserve in 2013. It covers , almost half of the territory of Sélestat, and is one of the largest riparian forests in France. It lies on the Ill, which forms a complex hydrographic network there. The site is subject to flooding and it is characteristic of the Grand Ried, a flat region located between the Ill and the Rhine that serves as a natural spillway for the two rivers.

Common trees are oaks, willows and alders, which tolerate wet soils. Because the phreatic table is very close to the surface, soils hardly freeze in winter and drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. This animal was introduced to the area in 1854.

The Illwald contains three chapels that were originally pilgrimage destinations. The Schnellenbuhl chapel was built by Jesuits in 1683; Our Lady of the Oaks dates back to the 15th century but it was rebuilt after a fire in 1920; Our Lady of Peace was built in 1960, and St. Anthony was founded in 1280 but rebuilt in 1930.

=== Other cultural institutions and events ===

Sélestat is the seat of the &quot;Agence culturelle d&#x27;Alsace&quot; (&quot;cultural agency of Alsace&quot;, ACA) since 1976. Since 1982, Sélestat is the seat of the FRAC Alsace, the Alsace branch of the Fonds régional d&#x27;art contemporain (&quot;Regional Contemporary art fund&quot;), administered by the ACA. A biennale dedicated to contemporary art takes place every two-year in autumn since 1984. It has welcomed artists like Daniel Buren, Ben Vautier, Sarkis Zabunyan and Agnès Varda. Since 2006, Sélestat is the seat of &quot;Archéologie Alsace&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Pôle interdépartemental d&#x27;archéologie rhénan&quot;, the &quot;Rhenish inter-départemental center for archaeology&quot;), which conducts and documents archaeological field surveys and excavations in Alsace.

Every year since 1927, Sélestat has organised a large flower procession through its old town. The &quot;corso fleuri&quot; is one of the biggest floral shows in eastern France. New floats are made each year around a theme and decorated with dahlias only. A carnaval procession is also held in March. It is the remnant of a very old tradition started by the town&#x27;s butchers. Sélestat also has festivals dedicated to electronic music (Epidemic Experience), satirical cartoons (Sélest&#x27;ival), a spring fun fair, and a summer medieval reenactment with a market and a procession.

The cultural complex &quot;Les Tanzmatten&quot;, built by Rudy Ricciotti, was inaugurated in 2000. It serves as the town&#x27;s concert and performances hall, as well as for exhibitions, commercial fairs and weddings.

<text>Baron Detlev von Liliencron born Friedrich Adolf Axel von Liliencron (3 June 1844 in Kiel22 July 1909) was a German poet and novelist from Kiel.

==Biography==

Liliencron was the son of Louis (Ludwig) Freiherr von Liliencron and Adeline von Harten. He entered the Prussian army and took part in the campaigns of 1866 and 1870–71 (Franco-Prussian War), in both of which he was wounded. In 1875, he retired with the rank of captain and spent some time in America (1875 to 1877), afterwards settling at Kellinghusen in Holstein, where he remained until 1887. After some time at Munich, he settled in Altona and later at Alt-Rahlstedt, now a part of Hamburg.

==Assessment==

Liliencron was one of the most eminent of German lyric poets of his time; his &quot;Adjutantenritte&quot;, with its fresh original style, broke with the well-worn literary conventions then prevalent which had been handed down from the middle of the century. Rainer Maria Rilke, among others, was heavily influenced by Liliencron&#x27;s poems. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Liliencron&#x27;s work is somewhat uneven, since he lacked the sustained power which makes a prose writer successful.

==Music==

His poems were set to music, such as &quot;Auf dem Kirchhofe&quot; by Johannes Brahms as No. 4 of his &quot;Fünf Lieder&quot;, Op. 105. German composers Luise Schulze-Berghof (1889-1970) and Pauline Volkstein (1849-1925) also set Liliencron’s text to music.

==Works==

He first attracted attention by the volume of poems, &quot;Adjutantenritte und andere Gedichte&quot; (1883), which was followed by several unsuccessful dramas, a volume of short stories, &quot;Eine Sommerschlacht&quot; (1886), and a novel &quot;Breide Hummelsbüttel&quot; (1887).

Other collections of short stories appeared under the titles &quot;Unter flatternden Fahnen&quot; (1888). &quot;Der Mäcen&quot; (1889), &quot;Krieg und Frieden&quot; (1891); of lyric poetry in 1889, 1890 (&quot;Der Heidegänger und andere Gedichte&quot;), 1893, and 1903 (&quot;Bunte Beute&quot;). Interesting, too, is the humorous epic &quot;Poggfred&quot; (1896; 2nd ed. 1904).

Liliencron&#x27;s complete works were published in 14 volumes (1904–1905); his &quot;Gedichte&quot; having been previously collected in four volumes under the titles &quot;Kampf und Spiele&quot;, &quot;Kämpfe und Ziele&quot;, &quot;Nebel und Sonne&quot; and &quot;Bunte Beute&quot; (1897–1903).

<text>Le Cateau-Cambrésis (, before 1977: &quot;Le Cateau&quot;) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. The term Cambrésis indicates that it lies in the county of that name which fell to the Prince-Bishop of Cambrai. Le Cateau station has rail connections to Paris, Maubeuge and Saint-Quentin.

==History==
*The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, ending the Italian Wars, was agreed there on 2–3 April 1559.
* Until 1678, the city belonged to the Spanish Netherlands (now called Belgium). France conquered the city officially by the treaty of Nijmegen signed in 1678.
*On 28 March 1794, allied forces under the prince of Coburg, defeated French forces at Le Cateau.
*Le Cateau formed the right wing of the front of II Corps of the British Expeditionary Force at the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August 1914, during its withdrawal from the Battle of Mons.

===Heraldry===
==Population==
==Matisse Museum==
The &quot;Musée Départemental Henri Matisse&quot; installed in the Palais Fénelon in the center of Le Cateau boasts the third largest collection of Matisse works in France.

==Notable people==
Births:
*Henri Matisse, artist
*Marshal Mortier
*Pierre Nord
*Raymond Poïvet, one of the creators of the French science fiction comics &quot;Les Pionniers de l&#x27;Espérance&quot;

Pierre Mauroy was a high school student in Le Cateau, and later its representative at the general council for the Nord department.

<text>&quot;Heartbeat&quot; is a song by the band King Crimson, released as a single in 1982. The music video stars Jill Kroesen and was innovative for its use of blending faces with a dissolving /morphing technique that would later be employed in music videos for Godley &amp; Creme&#x27;s &quot;Cry&quot; (1985) and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Black or White&quot; (1991).

The song was later recorded by King Crimson guitarist and singer Adrian Belew for his 1990 solo album, &quot;Young Lions&quot;.

<text>George Darley (1795–1846) was an Irish poet, novelist, literary critic, and author of mathematical texts. Friends with such literary luminaries as Charles Lamb, Thomas Carlyle, and John Clare, he was considered by some to be on a level with Tennyson in “poetic possibilities” in the 1840s, but in the words of famous literary critic George Saintsbury “he had the marks of a talent that never did what it had it in it to do.”

==Early years and career==
George Darley was born in Dublin, to Arthur Darley and his wife Mary. The Darleys were an important Dublin family of their time, and related to the Guinnesses by marriage, Arthur&#x27;s sister Mary having married Richard Guinness, whose uncle Arthur Guinness founded the Guinness brewing company. The Darleys also had a country house called Springfield in south County Dublin, near Enniskerry in County Wicklow, where George spent his early years.

George was awarded a BA in mathematics and classics from Trinity College Dublin in 1820. Having decided to follow a literary career, in 1821 he moved to London. He wrote poetry and plays in an attempt to break into literary circles, but had more luck getting published as a critic. During this period he supported himself by writing several mathematical texts for a series published by John Taylor (London) called Darley&#x27;s Scientific Library. In later life, he fell into depression and died on 23 November 1846 in London.

Playwright Dion Boucicault was a nephew. His grandnephew was the Irish musician and music collector Arthur Warren Darley.

==Works==
Darley published his first poem, &quot;Errors of Ecstasie&quot;, in 1822. He also wrote for the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, under the pseudonym of John Lacy. In it appeared his story &quot;Lilian of the Vale&quot;, later reprinted in his short-story collection &quot;The Labours of Idleness, or, Seven Nights&#x27; Experiments&quot; (1826), published under the pseudonym &quot;Guy Penseval.&quot; Various other books followed, including &quot;Sylvia, or The May Queen&quot;, a poem (1827).

Thereafter Darley joined the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, in which he became a severe critic. He was also a dramatist and studied old English plays, editing those of Beaumont and Fletcher in 1840. His poem &quot;It is not beauty I demand&quot; was included by F. T. Palgrave in the first edition of his &quot;Golden Treasury&quot; as an anonymous lyric of the 17th century.

Darley wrote a number of songs such as &quot;I&#x27;ve been Roaming&quot;, once popular, and praised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

He was also a mathematician, and published some treatises on the subject.

His works included:
*&quot;Nepenthe&quot;
*&quot;Sylvia; or, The May Queen&quot;
*&quot;The Mermaidens&#x27; Vesper-Hymn&quot;
*&quot;The Sea-Bride&quot;
*&quot;Thomas à Beckett: A Dramatic Chronicle in Five Acts&quot;
*&quot;A System of Popular Algebra&quot; (John Taylor, London, 1826?).
*&quot;A System of Popular Geometry&quot; (John Taylor, London, 1826).
*&quot;A System of Popular Trigonometry&quot; (John Taylor, London, 1827).
*&quot;The Geometrical Companion&quot; (John Taylor, London, 1828).
*&quot;Familiar Astronomy&quot; (John Taylor, London, 1830).

==Reputation==
A. E. Housman said of a passage from his poem &quot;Nepenthe&quot;, &quot;Admirers of the sea may call that a lampoon or a caricature, but they cannot deny that it is life-like: the man who wrote it had seen the sea, and the man who reads it sees the sea again&quot;. Darley was a friend of such literary luminaries as Charles Lamb, Thomas Carlyle, John Clare, and other writers such as Allan Cunningham and Monckton Milnes. Many considered him on a with level with Tennyson in “poetic possibilities” in the 1840s; but, in the words of famous literary critic George Saintsbury, “he had the marks of a talent that never did what it had it in it to do.”

As a critic he was considered capable, but attracted some hostility with his savage treatment of authors he disliked.

<text>Thomas Deloney (born ; died in or shortly before 1600) was an English silk-weaver, novelist, and ballad writer.

==Biography==
Thomas Deloney was born sometime in the middle decades of the 16th century; the precise date is not recorded. Although often alleged to be a native of Norwich, he was most likely born in London, where he was trained as a silk-weaver. French and Walloon immigrants dominated the silk-weaving trade in 16th-century England, and the name Deloney, which looks like an anglicized form of a French name such as De Laune or De Lanoy, suggests that his family may have been relatively recent arrivals in England. An entry in the parish register of St Giles-without-Cripplegate from 16 October 1586 records the baptism of his son Richard, who may have died within a few months.

During the 1580s and 1590s he became well known as a writer of popular printed ballads, many of which circulated as ephemeral broadsides, while others were collected in books and pamphlets. His subject matter, like that of most Elizabethan and Jacobean balladists, was wide-ranging and eclectic, including stories from English history and romance, religious and moral exhortations, social and political commentary, and journalistic reporting of current events. Among his topical poems on news of the day are a description of a fire that devastated the town of Beccles in Suffolk in November 1586; the confession of an adulterous wife in Devonshire who conspired to murder her husband in 1590; two accounts of the arrest and execution of the conspirators in the Babington Plot to overthrow the queen in 1586; and three ballads inspired by the campaign against the Spanish Armada in 1588, including one that describes Elizabeth&#x27;s visit and address to the troops at Tilbury.

Deloney&#x27;s writings on social and political issues sometimes created controversy. In 1595 he was briefly imprisoned as a result of his contribution to a letter signed by a group of yeoman weavers petitioning for stricter enforcement of the rules of the London Weavers&#x27; Company. And in 1596 a ballad on the scarcity of grain in London was criticized as &quot;scurrilous&quot; and &quot;vain and presumptuous&quot; by the mayor of the city, Stephen Slaney, in part because in it Deloney had the queen engage in a dialogue with her people &quot;in a very fond and undecent sort&quot;, which might incite discontent among the poor.
In the late 1590s Deloney turned to writing prose narratives, usually called novels in modern sources (although that word was not used by Deloney or his contemporaries). Four novels — &quot;Jack of Newbury&quot;, the two parts of &quot;The Gentle Craft&quot;, and &quot;Thomas of Reading&quot; — were published in the last three or four years of his life (1597–1600), and it is on these works that his modern reputation chiefly depends. They were enormously popular, so much so that the original printings were literally &quot;read to pieces&quot; and they survive today only in later 17th-century editions. Deloney&#x27;s novels are a mixture of historical romance and social and economic realism, which draw heavily in their choice of subject matter, background, and incidental details on his personal experience as a member of the commercial class of artisans and merchants in Elizabethan London. They are often thought to reflect the character and interests of the growing English &quot;middle class&quot;. &quot;Jack of Newbury&quot;, which is dedicated to the cloth-makers of England, is a fictionalized biography of John Winchcombe (−1557), a notable Tudor clothier, while &quot;The Gentle Craft&quot;, dedicated to his fellow artisans, the shoemakers, is a compilation of tales &quot;showing what famous men have been Shoomakers in time past in this Land, with their worthy deeds and great Hospitality&quot;. The popularity of the latter inspired at least two dramatic adaptations of some of its material, Thomas Dekker&#x27;s play &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1599) and William Rowley&#x27;s &quot;A Shoemaker a Gentleman&quot; (?).

Although Deloney was familiar with the elaborate euphuistic prose of John Lyly and his successors, and was capable of imitating it when he chose to, his style is normally more simple and straightforward. In its directness and vividness it owes something to the compilations of popular tales in contemporary jest books. He makes much greater use of dialogue than other contemporary writers of prose narratives, such as Robert Greene and Thomas Nashe, and shares some dramatic techniques with the Elizabethan playwrights.

Deloney probably died early in 1600, or perhaps late in the previous year. In &quot;Nine Daies Wonder&quot;, published in April 1600, William Kempe refers to a tune known as &quot;Thomas Deloney&#x27;s Epitaph&quot;, and writes that he (Kempe) had been the subject of &quot;abominable Ballets&quot; written by &quot;the great Ballet-maker, T.D., alias Tho. Deloney.&quot; In a mocking address to the other ballad-writers of London, he concludes &quot;I was given since to understand, your late general Tho. dyed poorley, as ye all must do, and was honestly buried, which is much to be doubted of some of you.&quot; Nothing else is known of the date or circumstances of his death.

<doc id="998880" wikidata="Q2564831" url="?curid=998880" title="Eikoh Hosoe">
<text>was a Japanese photographer and filmmaker who emerged in the experimental arts movement of post-World War II Japan. Hosoe is best known for his dark, high contrast, black and white photographs of human bodies. His images are often psychologically charged, exploring subjects such as death, erotic obsession, and irrationality. Some of his photographs reference religion, philosophy and mythology, while others are nearly abstract, such as &quot;Man and Woman # 24&quot;, from 1960. He was professionally and personally affiliated with the writer Yukio Mishima and experimental artists of the 1960s such as the dancer Tatsumi Hijikata, though his work extends to a diversity of subjects. His photography is not only notable for its artistic influence but for its wider contribution to the reputations of his subjects. 

==Biography==
Hosoe was born on 18 March 1933 in Yonezawa, Yamagata, one of three sons of Yonejiro and Mitsu Hosoe. At birth Hosoe&#x27;s name was &quot;Toshihiro&quot; (敏廣); he adopted the name &quot;Eikoh&quot; after World War II to symbolize a new Japan. He witnessed the firebombing of Tokyo in 1944 and his family was subsequently evacuated to his mother&#x27;s village. He returned to Tokyo where he was primarily raised. He is the older brother of the designer Isao Hosoe. 

In high school he was a member of the photography club and the English-Language club. In 1950 he took a photograph of a little girl living on the military base he visited every week to take English classes. This image, &quot;Poddie Jawoski&quot; won him top prize of the student section in the 1951 Fuji Photo Contest. After this, he decided to pursue photography as a career. After high-school he attended to Tokyo College of Photography. While he was a student there in the early 1950s Hosoe joined &quot;Demokrato,&quot; an avant-garde artists&#x27; group led by the artist Ei-Q. In the late 1950s, after graduating from Tokyo College of Photography, Hosoe worked as a freelance photographer for photography magazines and women&#x27;s magazines. At this time he also began associating with other young, progressive photographers such as Kikuji Kawada, Shomei Tomatsu, and Ikko Narahara. Hosoe cofounded the &quot;Vivo&quot; collective in 1959, which takes its name from the Esperanto word for &quot;life.&quot; 

In 1960, Hosoe created the Jazz Film Laboratory (&quot;Jazzu Eiga Jikken-shitsu&quot;) with Shuji Terayama, Shintaro Ishihara, and others. The Jazz Film Laboratory was a multidisciplinary artistic project aimed at producing highly expressive and intense works such as Hosoe&#x27;s 1960 short black and white film &quot;Navel and A-Bomb&quot; (&quot;Heso to genbaku&quot;). Art historian and curator Alexandra Munroe describes that the group was &quot;Anti-tradition, anti-authority, and opposed Social Realism&quot; and &quot;deliberately rejected common sense&quot; and &quot;the conventions of a rigid society.&quot; Other notable artistic affiliations of the time include Daido Moriyama, who worked as Hosoe&#x27;s assistant in 1961.

In the sixties Hosoe traveled abroad yearly, seeing the art of the Fluxus group in New York and of Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. Gaudi&#x27;s architecture would become an important subject for Hosoe&#x27;s photographs.

Hosoe died in Tokyo on 16 September 2024, at the age of 91 from an adrenal gland tumor.

== Relationship with Hijikata ==

Hosoe first met Tatsumi Hijikata in 1958 when the latter&#x27;s company performed an interpretation of Yukio Mishima&#x27;s novel Kinjiki (Forbidden Colors), about secret homosexual desire. The interpretation featured two dancers interacting with a chicken, a performance that Hosoe described as &quot;ferocious.&quot; According to curator and academic Yasufumi Nakamori, the encounter fundamentally changed Hosoe&#x27;s relationship to his photographic subjects in which Hosoe &quot;began to view himself as involved in the creation of a distinct space and time.&quot;

Hosoe began working with Hijikata, first on a brochure of photographs that would be featured in Hosoe&#x27;s first major collection, &quot;Man and Woman&quot; in 1961. The two subsequently traveled together to Hijikata&#x27;s home prefecture of Akita on multiple occasions during which their collaboration &quot;Kamaitachi&quot; (1969) came to fruition. Hosoe shot &quot;Kamaitachi&quot; with Hijikata as a model&quot;,&quot; a series of images that reference stories of a supernatural being—a &quot;sickle-toothed weasel&quot;—that haunted the Japanese countryside of Hosoe&#x27;s childhood. Munroe describes the kamaitachi as &quot;a small invisible animal that was believed to attack people in the rice paddies at night. When it struck, a person would find his limbs and flesh sliced as if by a flying blade, but strangely, the wounds were bloodless.&quot; In the photographs, Hijikata is seen wandering ghost-like within the stark landscape, confronting farmers and children. Initially playing the role of the Fool, by the end of the series Hijikata is seen ominously carrying off a young boy.

In 1968 Tadanori Yokoo designed the poster for &quot;Kamaitachi&quot;, which was both an exhibition and published in book form. &quot;Kamaitachi&quot; was also included a danced component choreographed and performed by Hijikata at Nikon Salon in Tokyo for the photographic exhibition&#x27;s opening.

== Relationship with Mishima ==
&quot;Man and Woman&quot;, Hosoe and Hijikata&#x27;s first photographic collaboration, was seen by Hijikata&#x27;s friend Yukio Mishima, who asked Hosoe for photographs to feature in his collection of essays. The subsequent result was &quot;The Assault of Beauty.&quot; After this, Hosoe asked Mishima to model for him. It is reported that Mishima said to Hosoe, &quot;I will give myself up to you as the subject matter for your camera. I want you to feel free to use me as you see fit and take whatever images your vision suggests.&quot; This led to their well-known &quot;Killed by Roses&quot; or &quot;Ordeal by Roses&quot; (&quot;Bara-kei&quot;, 薔薇刑, 1961–1962). In these photographs, Hosoe created a series of dark, erotic images centered on the male body with Mishima dramatically posing. The series was primarily taken at the writer&#x27;s home in the Magome district of Tokyo between autumn 1961 and spring 1962. The photographs employ props such as a garden hose and a mallet to seemingly symbolic, yet ambiguous, effect. Mishima was pleased with the photographs, in part because of how they resisted straightforward or singular interpretations.

Pleased with the outcome, the two decided to shoot together again. This time, Mishima told his wife to leave with their children beforehand, claiming the shoot may have negative effects on their morals. Occasionally featuring other people like Hijikata or the actress Kyoko Enami, these subsequent photos sometime evoke aspects of Mishima&#x27;s favorite paintings by Botticelli and Giorgione. In the preface to the published edition, Mishima recounts, &quot;The world to which I was abducted under the spell of his lens was abnormal, warped, sarcastic, grotesque, savage, and promiscuous . . . yet there was a clear undercurrent of lyricism murmuring gently through its unseen conduits.&quot; During this time, Daido Moriyama was Hosoe&#x27;s assistant. He has recalled the complex and difficult darkroom technique he had to employ in order to produce the images that Hosoe had imagined. The compositing of negatives produces a dream-like or mythological effect, heightened by the stark contrast and suggestive imagery.

One of these photographs appeared on the cover of Mishima&#x27;s &quot;Assault of Beauty&quot; (Bi no shūgeki) in 1961, a Kōdansha-published collection of essays. The following year, the photographs were exhibited at &quot;Non,&quot; an exhibition organized by Tatsuo Fukushima at the Matsuda Department Store in Tokyo. The images were then published as &quot;Barakei&quot; in March 1963 in a large-format book designed by Kōhei Sugiura. The book was organized into five chapters: Preface, Daily Civilian Life, The Scornful Clock, or the Slothful Witness, Various Blasphemies, and Ordeal by Roses. According to Hosoe, Mishima had suggested a handful of titles from which &quot;Barakei&quot; was chosen, including &quot;Death and Loquaciousness,&quot; &quot;Passion Variations,&quot; &quot;Sketches of Martyrdom.&quot; Mishima would later say that Hosoe&#x27;s photographs enabled him to live in &quot;grotesque, barbaric and dissipated&quot; inner world, shot with &quot;a pure undercurrent of lyricism&quot;. The work earned Hosoe considerable notoriety in Japan.

In 1970 Hosoe had decided to republish the collection of photographs shot with Mishima as a new, international edition. This new edition was to be designed by Tadanori Yokoo. Scheduled for November, the release was postponed when Yokoo was involved in a car accident. Shortly after, on 25 November, the &quot;Mishima Incident&quot; occurred, ending with Mishima&#x27;s ritual suicide by &quot;seppuku&quot; in 1970. Hosoe has noted that he did notice some unusual things at this time, such as the early completion and delivery of Mishima&#x27;s preface for Hosoe&#x27;s forthcoming collection &quot;Hōyō&quot; (Embrace), although Mishima&#x27;s suicide came as a complete surprised to his friend Hosoe.

Hosoe halted work on the second edition of &quot;Killed by Roses&quot;, unsure of how it would be received in the immediate aftermath of Mishima&#x27;s spectacular suicide. A significant reason was that he did not want to appear to be taking advantage of Mishima&#x27;s death for his personal gain. However, Mishima widow, Yōko Mishima, persuaded him to go ahead with the planned release, noting that her late husband had been eagerly anticipating its release. The edition was published in January 1971 by Shūeisha International. Hosoe has since expressed uneasiness about being too closely associated with Mishima and his legacy, although his works with the writer comprise an enduring aspect of the photographer&#x27;s legacy.

== Later work and achievements ==

While Hosoe is often associated with Hijikata and Mishima for the influential, collaborative works he produced with them, he also photographed many of his other artist-friends. These include Simon Yotsuya, a cross-dressing dollmaker, and Kazuo Ohno, a Butoh dance collaborator with Hijikata who developed his own idiosyncratic style and performed until his death at age 103. One photograph captures Ohno, no longer mobile in his old age, dancing with his hands while seated in his wheelchair.

1992 saw a 30-year retrospective &quot;Eikoh Hosoe: Meta&quot; at San Diego&#x27;s Museum of Photographic Arts. The nineties also saw other activities of Hosoe in America, such as conducting photography workshops in various places that focused on the nude model. His own work from this includes the series &quot;Luna Rossa&quot; (2000), which was photographed in Alaska, Colorado, and upstate New York. The work is notable for its utilization of darkroom techniques such as solarization and masking that produce effects of an intensity atypical of his previous work.

Hosoe was the director of the Kiyosato Museum of Photographic Arts (Kiyosato, Yamanashi) from the time of its opening in 1995. The Museum held a retrospective of his photographs in 2021. In 2002 he was given a Special Award from the Photographic Society of Japan. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Special 150th Anniversary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2003.

<text>The is a major commuter line operated by the private railway operator Tokyu Corporation and connecting south-western suburbs of Tokyo and neighbouring Kanagawa Prefecture, with its western terminus of , to a major railway junction of western downtown Tokyo, . At Shibuya, nearly all the trains continue on the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line.

The line&#x27;s color on maps and station guides is green, and stations carry the prefix &quot;DT&quot; followed by a number.

==History==
===Prewar predecessors===
On March 6, 1907, the opened the first section of an interurban line between Shibuya and what is now , using gauge. The line was called the and is not to be confused with today&#x27;s Tokyu Tamagawa Line (東急多摩川線). The branch from Sangen-Jaya Station opened on January 18, 1925.

===Tama Den-En-Toshi Plan===
In 1953, Tokyu Group president Keita Gotō unveiled a &quot;new town&quot; planning scheme called the &quot;South-Western Area Development Plan&quot;. He envisioned new railway line and freeway and large, clean houses for commuters working in Tokyo. The railway line would become the Tama Den-En-Toshi Line and the expressway the Tōmei Expressway. The parts of the new line completely overlaps the Tamagawa Line and the project is known as the Shin-Tamagawa Line or &quot;New Tamagawa Line&quot; which runs in an underground alignment under the old interurban line. The Tamagawa Line was closed in 1969 in anticipation for the opening of the Shin-Tamagawa Line, with the remaining branch line of the Tamagawa Electric Railway split off into the present Tokyu Setagaya Line. The underground Shin-Tamagawa Line opened a few years later in 1977, completely replacing the closed interurban line. Upon opening it was treated as a separate line from the Ōimachi Line connecting to said line at Futako-Tamagawa.

===Development of the line===
In 2000, Tama Den-En-Toshi Line as depicted today was created by merging the Shin-Tamagawa Line and the section of the Ōimachi Line west of . Trains through servicing into the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line was extended beyond into Isesaki Line and Nikkō Line of Tobu Railway on March 19, 2003.

Tokyu has expanded the line to four tracks from Futako-Tamagawa to Mizonokuchi; most trains of the Ōimachi line run through this section to Mizonokuchi, with some local trains making the intermediate stops. This service began in June 2009, postponed from fiscal 2007. Ōimachi line trains, which are 5- or 7-car sets, will then run between and Mizonokuchi.

==Operation==
Nearly all trains on the Den-en-toshi Line are operated through to/from the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line using Tokyu, Tokyo Metro, and Tobu Railway 10-car EMUs. Around half of them continue beyond , the terminus of the Hanzomon Line, to the Tobu Skytree Line (Kita-Koshigaya Station, Kita-Kasukabe Station and Tōbu-Dōbutsu-Kōen Station), Tobu Isesaki Line (Kuki Station), and Tōbu Nikkō Line (Minami-Kurihashi Station). At rush hour, an inbound train arrives as frequently as every 2 minutes 10 seconds.

===Service types===
The following three types of service are operated on the line.
; (L)
:Stops at all stations. Eight services per hour in each direction during the daytime. Two of eight are not through service to the Hanzōmon Line.
; (SE)
:In the morning rush hour, all limited-stop services are semi-express.
:In the daytime, two services are operated per hour in each direction and connect to a local train at Shibuya (outbound only), Saginuma and Nagatsuta (inbound only).
; (Ex)
:Not operated in morning rush hour. In the daytime, six services are operated per hour in each direction and two of six is through to the Ōimachi Line. Most express connect to a local train at Sangen-jaya (inbound only), Futako-tamagawa (outbound and through service to the Ōimachi Line), Saginuma and Nagatsuta.

===Through trains to Ōimachi Line===
On weekends, two seven-car express trains per days are operated to/from and . Also, a few trains are operated through to/from the Tōkyū Ōimachi Line to utilize forwardings to/from Saginuma depot, up to Ōimachi in the mornings, and down to in the late evenings. These formations are 7-car sets, unlike the 10-car trains normally used on the line. A few express trains during the holidays also serve from in the mornings, down in the evenings.

<doc id="998884" wikidata="Q1248337" url="?curid=998884" title="John Denham (poet)">
<text>Sir John Denham FRS (1614 or 1615 – 19 March 1669) was an Anglo-Irish poet and courtier, who formulated a primary model of the English pastoral epic in his poem &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot;. During the Civil War he served the Royalist cause in various capacities, enjoying the trust and favour of Charles I and Henrietta Maria and assisting in their embassies and secret correspondence. Having lost most of his estates by sequestration for delinquency (in supporting the royal cause) and through a disposition to gambling, at the Restoration he recovered his fortunes, and became Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works (between the terms of office of Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren). The happiness of his last years was tainted by his young wife&#x27;s adulterous affair with the Duke of York, whom Denham had personally rescued as a young man from the parliament forces and borne safely to his mother the Queen in Holland. He is buried among the poets in Westminster Abbey.

==Early life==
Denham was born in Dublin, only son to Sir John Denham, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and his second wife, Eleanor Moore, daughter of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore, and his wife, Mary Colley. His father was a native of London, and returned to England in 1617 to take up office as a Baron of the Exchequer. The family later settled at Egham in Surrey, where the poet&#x27;s father rebuilt the rectory, called &quot;The Place&quot;, and in 1624 founded almshouses for five poor women. His mother died in childbirth when he was about five years old. Sir John purchased property at Little Horkesley, Essex, in 1631. John Denham the poet was first cousin to George Morley, the Restoration Bishop of Winchester, whose mother Sarah (Denham) was a sister of the poet&#x27;s father.

It is thought that John Denham was schooled at Westminster or London, and was &quot;made full ripe for the university&quot;. He progressed to Trinity College, Oxford (where he matriculated in November 1631 as of Little Horkesley), and to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London (admitted 26 April 1631; barrister-at-law in 1638). He was an indifferent student, and was notorious for heavy gambling, which was a source of much worry to his father. Anthony à Wood says that at Oxford he was looked upon as a slow and dreaming young man, given more to cards and dice than his study: he was examined for his B.A., but it is not proved that he was awarded his degree. 

At Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, though he followed his study very close, &quot;yet he would game much, and frequent the company of the unsanctified crew of gamesters, who rook&#x27;d him sometimes of all he could wrap or get.&quot; His father reprimanded him severely, in response to which he wrote a concise essay, &quot;The Anatomy of Play&quot;, dedicated to his father, describing the perils of gambling. This production, intelligently argued and peppered with Latin lines from classical authors, seems fully sincere despite a certain bravado, and was published long afterwards (1651) for the common good, supposedly without Denham&#x27;s knowledge. However, he failed to follow his own advice.

===First marriage: Anne Cotton===
He married first, in 1634, Anne Cotton, of Whittington, Gloucestershire, by whom he had three children, a son who died young and two daughters who reached adulthood. The daughter of Don Coton (born 1599) and Elizabeth Tippinge, Anne was heir to a wealthy family: by this marriage John Denham came into possession, first, of the manor of Horsenden, Buckinghamshire, and, in or after 1642, of Whittington Court (originally assigned to Anne&#x27;s sister and coheir Appolina). A male child of John and Anne&#x27;s was buried at Egham in August 1638: his father Sir John expired in 1639, and is commemorated in Egham church by an elaborately carved wall monument, and his wives by another. Denham seems to have run through his wife&#x27;s money quickly. His losses from gambling ran to several thousand pounds, although in the 1630s he made some effort to reform. On his father&#x27;s death in 1639 he inherited the family estate at Egham. He proceeded to go on one more gambling spree, and again lost several thousand.

==Civil War and Commonwealth period==
===&quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot;===

During the 1630s Denham made a verse translation out of Book II of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which remained unpublished until 1656. In 1641 he gained some public fame from the performance at Blackfriars of his historical tragi-comedy in blank verse, &quot;The Sophy&quot;. This drama, set in Persia, was of a style of theatricals then passing out of fashion. Even so it was a popular success, not least because Denham&#x27;s dramatic capabilities were unforeseen. Edmund Waller observed: &quot;He broke-out like the Irish Rebellion - threescore thousand strong, before any body was aware.&quot; 

His best-known poem, &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot;, descriptive of the landscape around Egham, was printed in 1642 and came to a second edition in 1643. This model of pastoral epic, in which Denham successfully combined moral reflections (prompted by the distant prospect of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral) with the proximate scenery of Windsor Forest, the River Thames and Runnymede, freighted with ancient royal associations, was his masterpiece and his lasting example to literary posterity. Thomas Catesby Paget remarked: &quot;Sir John Denham&#x27;s &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot; has met with universal Applause, tho&#x27; its Subject seems rather descriptive than instructing; but &#x27;tis not the Hill, the River, nor the Stag Chase, &#x27;tis the good Sense and the fine Reflections so frequently interspers&#x27;d, and as it were interwoven with the rest, that gives it the Value, and will make it, as was said of &quot;true Wit, everlasting like the Sun&quot;.&#x27; Denham continued to revise it until 1655.

===Farnham, Oxford and London===
Denham suffered for his adherence to the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey for 1642, and took possession of Farnham Castle, installing a garrison of 100 men. Farnham quickly fell to Parliamentary forces under Sir William Waller (1 December 1642), and Denham was sent a prisoner to London, but was soon released. However, his estates in Suffolk and Essex (Horkesley) were sequestrated in December 1643, and in November 1645 his distressed wife Anne brought a petition claiming that the Committees for those counties were attempting to cheat her out of her one-fifth part entitlement. Anne died in 1646.
From 1642 Denham spent five years in Oxford, where he enjoyed the trust and confidence of Charles I. During the abortive peace negotiations of 1646, Parliament listed him as one of those who must be excluded from the King&#x27;s counsels. During 1647 he bore letters from Henrietta Maria to the King at Holdenby Palace in Northamptonshire, and with Sir Edward Ford, John Ashburnham and Sir John Berkeley he was involved in an attempt to reach a settlement between the royal and parliamentary factions which, however, proved abortive. 

The King, being in custody when leaving Hampton Court in November 1647, gave to Denham the personal charge of the secret forwarding and receiving of the royal correspondence, instructing him to remain privately in London. In these proceedings he was associated with the royalist poet Abraham Cowley. Access to the king was facilitated through Hugh Peters, whom Denham had known during his imprisonment after having been captured at Dartmouth in 1646. Various ciphers were employed, but after Cowley&#x27;s handwriting was recognized, suspicions were raised and the work was discontinued. Denham and the correspondents escaped discovery.

===Missions and sequestrations===
In 1648 Denham assisted in getting the young Duke of York to safety in Holland, after which he became attached to the court of Henrietta Maria in Paris, who entrusted him with despatches for Holland. In 1650-52, with William Crofts, 1st Baron Crofts, he made an embassy to Poland to collect funds on behalf of Charles II, an appeal which (by tariffs on the Scottish merchants in Poland) raised £10,000. These details are mentioned by Denham in his &quot;Epistle to the King&quot; prefixed to the collected edition of his poems first published in 1668. 

It is said that Denham stayed abroad as much to avoid the consequences of his debts in England and the dissipation of his Egham estate, as from any fear of his personal safety for political reasons. Parliament ordered the sale of his lands in 1651, and in 1652 the sequestration imposed for his adherence to the royal cause was lifted to permit their sale and distribution. He returned in 1652 to find them mostly sold. 

For a time Denham was almost penniless, but he received the hospitality of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke, with whom he resided for a year. Horsenden was bought by Colonel John Fielder, guardian and trustee of Denham&#x27;s children, in 1654. In 1655 the authorities, worried by his frequent visits to London, ordered him to choose a residence more than twenty miles from the capital, which he was not to leave. He settled at Bury St. Edmunds. In 1658-59 he travelled on the Continent with William Herbert, the future Lord Herbert, son of his benefactor and host the 5th Earl of Pembroke.

===Anecdote===
John Aubrey recorded a story of this period which reflects well on Denham&#x27;s wit and generosity of spirit. &quot;In the time of the civill warres, George Withers, the poet, begged Sir John Denham&#x27;s estate at Egham of the Parliament, in whose cause he was a captaine of horse. It happened that G. W. was taken prisoner, and was in danger of his life, having written severely against the king, &amp;c. Sir John Denham went to the king, and desired his majestie not to hang him, for that whilest G. W. lived he should not be the worst poet in England.&quot;

==After 1660==

Denham no doubt felt the warmth of royal favour from the moment of the King&#x27;s return. His cousin George Morley, who had been with the court in exile, was consecrated Bishop of Winchester in 1660. Denham became a Member of Parliament for Old Sarum in 1661, and a Knight of the Bath at the Coronation in April 1661. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May 1663. He received substantial grants of land in compensation for his forfeited estates, and recovered Horsenden, which he sold to John Grubbe in 1662. He also recovered Whittington, which he gave later to his daughter Elizabeth.

===Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works===
At the Restoration Denham became Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works, probably owing to his earlier political services rather than for any aptitude as an architect. Indeed he claimed that the reversion of the office had been promised to him as an unsolicited favour by King Charles I during the troubles. John Webb, who, as Inigo Jones&#x27;s deputy, was undoubtedly competent for the post, complained that &quot;though Mr. Denham may, as most gentry, have some knowledge of the theory of architecture, he can have none of the practice and must employ another&quot;. There is no evidence that he personally designed any buildings, although he seems to have been a capable administrator. He may have been involved in the design of his own intended home, Burlington House in Piccadilly, begun in about 1664. John Webb was appointed Denham&#x27;s deputy by 1664 and did Denham&#x27;s work at Greenwich (from 1666) and elsewhere.

===Second marriage: Margaret Brooke===

In 1665 Denham made a second marriage to Margaret Brooke (1642–1667), daughter of Sir William Brooke and his second wife Penelope Hill, and half-sister of the leading statesman Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford. The marriage was to prove an unhappy one. Margaret, a beautiful young woman almost thirty years Denham&#x27;s junior, conducted a very public liaison with the future King James II. To her husband&#x27;s mortification, she insisted on being acknowledged openly as a royal mistress, saying that unlike her predecessor Goditha Price (daughter of Sir Herbert Price, the Master of the Household) she would not &quot;go up and down the back stairs, but would be owned publicly&quot;. 

Margaret died suddenly in January 1666/67 after a short illness. This gave rise to a rumour, promoted by Samuel Pepys among others, that Denham had murdered her by giving her a poisoned cup of chocolate. However, the autopsy found no trace of poison, and she had been seriously ill during the previous year. Other possible poisoners, including James, his wife Anne Hyde and his sister-in-law, Lady Rochester, were similarly suggested by the rumours. The construction site at Burlington House was sold in an unfinished state in 1667 to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, immediately after Margaret Denham&#x27;s death.

===Last years, death, and children===
His last years were clouded by dementia. He was rumoured to be insane, a condition widely attributed to his scandalous marriage. The London public were hostile, regarding him as a murderer, and he became very reclusive. Yet it is observed that his beautiful elegy upon Abraham Cowley, written at this time, shows no loss of his powers poetical nor diminution of his intellectuals. Charles II requested in March 1669 that Christopher Wren be appointed Denham&#x27;s &quot;sole deputy&quot;; Wren succeeded him as King&#x27;s Surveyor upon his death two weeks later. Denham made his will on 13 March 1668/69 appointing his daughter Elizabeth his sole executor, and Sir John Birkenhead and William Ashburnham his overseers: Elizabeth proved the will in May 1670. He was buried in Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey. The public suspicion about his role in his wife&#x27;s death continued to the end of his life. 

His son,
* John Denham, armiger, matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, in July 1654. He apparently died without issue before his father, and is not mentioned in the will.

He was survived by his daughters:
* Elizabeth Denham, married Sir Thomas Arden Price in 1675 but died childless;
* Anne Denham, married Sir William Morley of Halnaker, by whom she had two sons who died young and a daughter Mary, who married James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby, but had no surviving issue.

===Heraldry===
The wall memorial to the two wives of Sir John Denham senior, at Egham parish church, shows:
* &quot;Gules a fesse indented ermine&quot; (for Denham), impaling &quot;Sable a fesse indented with three molets on the fesse&quot;.
John Aubrey gives the Denham coat as 
* &quot;Gules, three lozenges ermine&quot;.
Burke gives for Sir John the poet
* &quot;Gules, three fusils ermine&quot;, with a crest &quot;A lion&#x27;s head erased ermine&quot;.

==Works==
Denham began his literary career with a tragedy, &quot;The Sophy&quot; (1641), but his poem &quot;&quot; (1642) is the work by which he is remembered. It is the first example in English of a poem devoted to local description, picturing the Thames Valley scenery around his home at Egham in Surrey. Denham made various revisions to the poem. Robert Herrick, John Dryden and Alexander Pope all wrote of &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot; with admiration. The poem was praised by Samuel Johnson for its smooth flow and economy of language.
* &quot;The Anatomy of Play. Written by a worthy and learned gent. Dedicated to his father to show his detestation of it&quot; (Nicholas Bourne, London 1651).
* &quot;The Destruction of Troy, An Essay upon the Second Book of Virgils Æneis. Written in the year, 1636&quot; (Humphrey Moseley, London 1656).
* &quot;Poems and Translations, with The Sophy&quot; (H. Herringman, London 1668).
* &quot;Cato Major, Of Old Age. A Poem&quot; (Henry Herringman, 1669). (An adaptation of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Senectute&quot;).
* &quot;A Version of the Psalms of David, fitted to the Tunes used in Churches&quot;, with a Preface. (Posthumously printed for J Bowyer, H. Clements, T. Varnam and J. Osborn, London 1714).

Gilfillan wrote of Denham and his contemporary Edmund Waller: &quot;Neither Denham nor Waller were great poets; but they have produced lines and verses so good, and have, besides, exerted an influence so considerable on modern versification, and the style of poetical utterance, that they are entitled to a highly respectable place amidst the sons of British song.&quot;

He also received extravagant praise from Samuel Johnson, who quoted Denham&#x27;s verse to exemplify the use of several words; but the place now assigned to him is more humble.

<doc id="998886" wikidata="Q1377316" url="?curid=998886" title="European Bat Night">
<text>The European Bat Night is a popular, annual event to draw public awareness to threatened bat populations in Europe. It is hosted by local nature conservation organisations and attracts a number of ecologically interested people, families, and children. Depending on the local contributors, there are species exhibitions, presentations, workshops for constructing bat houses, and bat walks at night time.

== History ==
The first European Bat Nights were arranged in the 1990s in Poland and France. Since 1997 the Bat Night is organised under the auspices of the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS). Today the event takes place in several cities and regions in more than 30 countries throughout Europe. It is traditionally held on the last weekend of August, but the definite choice of the date is left to the organisers.

== Aim of the event ==
Bat conservation requires effective publicity as well as the cooperation of private persons, because bats often breed and hibernate in houses, churches and other buildings used by people. The European Bat Night aims to break down the barriers between humans and bats by passing on information about the way bats live and their needs.

<doc id="998889" wikidata="Q71442" url="?curid=998889" title="Johann Jakob Engel">
<text>Johann Jakob Engel (11 September 1741 – 28 June 1802) was a German author.

== Life ==

Engel was born and died in Parchim, in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He studied theology at Rostock and Bützow, and philosophy at Leipzig, where he took his doctors&#x27; degree. In 1776 he was appointed professor of moral philosophy and belles-lettres in the Joachimstal gymnasium at Berlin, and a few years later he became tutor to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards Frederick William III.

The lessons which he gave his royal pupil in ethics and politics were published in 1798 under the title &quot;Fürstenspiegel&quot; (&quot;Mirror for Princes&quot;), and are a favourable specimen of his powers as a popular philosophical writer. In 1787 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in the same year he became director of the royal theatre, an office he resigned in 1794.

== Works ==

Besides numerous dramas, some of which had a considerable success, Engel wrote several valuable books on aesthetic subjects. His &quot;Anfangsgründe einer Theorie der Dichtungsarten&quot; (&quot;Initial foundations for a theory of poetry types,&quot; 1783) showed fine taste and acute critical faculty if it lacked imagination and poetic insight. The same excellences and the same defects were apparent in his &quot;Ideen zu einer Mimik&quot; (1785), written in the form of letters.
It demonstrated a knowledge of human nature, and may be regarded as a kind of manual for actors.

His most popular work was &quot;Der Philosoph für die Welt&quot; (1775), which consists chiefly of dialogues on men and morals, written from the utilitarian standpoint of the philosophy of the day. His last work, a romance entitled &quot;Herr Lorenz Stark&quot; (1795), achieved a great success, by virtue of the marked individuality of its characters and its appeal to middle-class sentiment.

He wanted to make the German theatre the mirror of the national life, and he wrote several plays, but they were of little merit – &quot;Der dankbare Sohn&quot; and &quot;Edelknaben&quot; are examples.

Engel&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche Schriften&quot; (&quot;complete writings&quot;) were published in twelve volumes at Berlin in 1801–1806; a new edition appeared at Frankfort in 1851.

<doc id="998890" wikidata="Q207542" url="?curid=998890" title="CentOS">
<text>CentOS (, from Community Enterprise Operating System; also known as CentOS Linux) is a discontinued Linux distribution that provided a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In January 2014, CentOS announced the official joining with Red Hat while staying independent from RHEL, under a new CentOS governing board.

The first CentOS release in May 2004, numbered as CentOS version 2, was forked from RHEL version 2.1AS. Since version 8, CentOS officially supports the x86-64, ARM64, and POWER8 architectures, and releases up to version 6 also supported the IA-32 architecture. , AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are available for the IA-32 architecture, Power ISA, and for the ARMv7hl and AArch64 variants of the ARM architecture. CentOS 8 was released on 24 September 2019.

In December 2020, Red Hat unilaterally terminated CentOS development in favor of CentOS Stream 9, a distribution positioned upstream of RHEL. In March 2021, CloudLinux (makers of CloudLinux OS) released a RHEL derivative called AlmaLinux. Later in May 2021, one of the CentOS founders (Gregory Kurtzer) created the competing Rocky Linux project as a successor to the original mission of CentOS.

== History ==
CentOS originated as a build of CAOS Linux, an RPM-based Linux distribution started by Gregory Kurtzer in 2002. Infiscale described its GravityOS as &quot;[including] the small footprint of Caos&quot;, indicating a certain level of influence from the discontinued distribution.

In June 2006, David Parsley, the primary developer of Tao Linux (another RHEL clone), announced the retirement of Tao Linux and its rolling into CentOS development. Tao users migrated to the CentOS release via .

In July 2009, it was reported in an open letter on the CentOS Project web site that one of CentOS&#x27;s founders, Lance Davis, had disappeared in 2008. Davis had ceased contribution to the project, but continued to hold the registration for the CentOS domain and PayPal account. In August 2009, the CentOS team reportedly made contact with Davis and obtained the centos.info and centos.org domains.

In July 2010, CentOS overtook Debian to become the most popular Linux distribution for web servers, with almost 30% of all Linux web servers using it. Debian retook the lead in January 2012.

In January 2014, Red Hat announced that it would sponsor the CentOS Project, &quot;helping to establish a platform well-suited to the needs of open source developers that integrate technologies in and around the operating system&quot;. As a result of these changes, ownership of CentOS trademarks was transferred to Red Hat, which now employs most of the CentOS head developers; however, they work as part of Red Hat&#x27;s Open Source and Standards team, which operates separately from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux team. A new CentOS governing board was also established.

On 8 December 2020, the CentOS Project announced that the distribution would be discontinued at the end of 2021 in order to focus on CentOS Stream. The community&#x27;s response to this announcement was overwhelmingly negative. Soon thereafter, Gregory Kurtzer (one of CentOS&#x27;s founders) announced a new project to continue the original CentOS focus, which became known as Rocky Linux. CloudLinux created AlmaLinux to provide a community-supported successor to CentOS Linux, aiming for binary-compatibility with the current version of RHEL. A beta version of AlmaLinux was first released on February 1, 2021, and the first stable release of AlmaLinux was published on March 30, 2021. A beta version of Rocky Linux was released on April 30, 2021, and subsequently on June 21, 2021, the stable release of Rocky Linux 8.4 was released.

== Design ==
CentOS developers use Red Hat&#x27;s source code to create a final product very similar to RHEL. Red Hat&#x27;s branding and logos are changed because Red Hat does not allow them to be redistributed. CentOS is available free of charge. Technical support is primarily provided by the community via official mailing lists, web forums, and chat rooms.

The project is affiliated with Red Hat but aspires to be more public, open, and inclusive. While Red Hat employs most of the CentOS head developers, the CentOS Project itself relies on donations from users and organizational sponsors.

== Versioning and releases ==

=== CentOS releases ===
CentOS version numbers for releases older than 7.0 have two parts, a major version and a minor version, which correspond to the major version and update set of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) used to build a particular CentOS release. For example, CentOS 6.5 is built from the source packages of RHEL 6 update 5 (also known as RHEL version 6.5), which is a so-called &quot;point release&quot; of RHEL 6.

Starting with version 7.0, CentOS version numbers also include a third part that indicates the monthstamp of the source code the release is based on. For example, version number 7.0-1406 still maps this CentOS release to the zeroth update set of RHEL 7, while &quot;1406&quot; indicates that the source code this release is based on dates from June 2014. Using the monthstamp allows installation images to be reissued for () oncoming container and cloud releases, while maintaining a connection to the related base release version.

Since mid-2006 and starting with RHEL version 4.4, which is formally known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 update 4, Red Hat has adopted a version-naming convention identical to that used by CentOS (for example, RHEL 4.5 or RHEL 6.5).

On 10 September 2019 CentOS deferred CentOS 8.1 work for CentOS 7.7 since CentOS 7.x was in production and CentOS 8.x was not in production. Once CentOS 7.7 was released resources moved back to CentOS 8.0.

On 24 September 2019 CentOS officially released CentOS version 8.0. Since CentOS was discontinued at the end of 2021, its final release was version 8.5 (2021-11-16). In contrast, its RHEL counterpart continued to version 8.10 (as of 2024-09).

==== End-of-support schedule ====
According to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) life cycle, CentOS 5, 6 and 7 will be &quot;maintained for up to 10 years&quot; as it is based on RHEL. Previously, CentOS 4 had been supported for seven years.


==== Older version information ====
===== CentOS version 7 =====
==== Latest version information ====

===== CentOS version 8 =====
=== AltArch releases ===
AltArch releases are released by the Alternative Architecture Special Interest Group (AltArch SIG) to support architectures that are not supported by the base CentOS releases.

=== Add-ons releases ===
Software Collections (SCL) is a CentOS repository that provides a set of programming languages, database servers, and various related packages. Provided software versions are either more recent than their equivalent versions included in the base CentOS distribution, or are made available as official CentOS packages for the first time. (See also the list of CentOS repositories below.)

Packages available from the SCL do not replace the default system tools provided with CentOS. Instead, a parallel set of tools is installed in the directory, and can be optionally enabled per application by using supplied utility. For example, the default versions of Perl or MySQL remain those provided by the base CentOS installation.

=== Releases without upstream equivalents ===
Some of the ISO images released by the CentOS Project have no direct upstream equivalents. They are created for specific purposes, such as for providing a live bootable image, or for providing a reduced-size installation medium. In addition to those listed below, there are also AltArch releases, which also have no direct upstream equivalents.

LiveCD and LiveDVD images contain a bootable compressed file system, created by a set of custom scripts using a kickstart configuration file. These live images can be also installed to hard disk, thus obtaining a fully functional CentOS installation. The set of packages installed that way on a hard disk can not be adjusted during the installation, as that is a simple transfer of the image existing on CD/DVD, to a hard disk. After booting from hard disk, yum can be used for adding or removing packages.

MinimalCD images contain a minimum of packages required for a functional installation, with no compromises in security or network usability. These minimal images use the standard CentOS installer with all of its regular features minus the selection of packages. Yum can be used after the installation is completed to add or remove packages.

== Special interest groups ==
Special interest groups (SIGs) are organized portions of the CentOS community that open paths for building specialized variants of CentOS, which fulfill specific sets of requirements. SIGs have the freedom to modify and enhance CentOS in various ways, including adding more cutting-edge software, rebuilding existing packages depending on the requirements, providing alternative desktop environments, or making CentOS available on otherwise unsupported architectures.

== Architectures ==
As of version 8, CentOS fully supports x86-64, POWER8 and 64-bit ARM architectures, while the following architectures are not supported:
* IA-32 in all variants, not supported since CentOS 7
* IA-32 without Physical Address Extension (PAE), not supported since CentOS 6
* IA-64 (Intel Itanium architecture), was supported in CentOS 3 and 4
* 32-bit PowerPC (Apple Macintosh and PowerMac running the G3 or G4 PowerPC processor), beta support was available in CentOS 4
* IBM Mainframe (eServer zSeries and S/390), not supported since CentOS 5
* Alpha, support was available in CentOS 4
* SPARC, beta support was available in CentOS 4

, AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are available for the ARMv7hl and AArch64 variants of the ARM architecture, and plans exist for supporting other variants of the ARM architecture. ARM support is a community effort coordinated through the AltArch SIG. AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are also available for the IA-32 architecture and Power ISA (POWER7 and POWER8 chips).

A Live CD version of CentOS is available at &quot;mirror.centos.org&quot;. A bootable Live USB image of CentOS can be created manually or with UNetbootin.

CentOS images are also available on Amazon&#x27;s EC2 cloud, in form of prebuilt and already published Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

== Repositories ==
There are three primary CentOS repositories (also known as channels), containing software packages that make up the main CentOS distribution:
* codice_1 : contains packages that form CentOS point releases, and gets updated when the actual point release is formally made available in form of ISO images.
* codice_2 : contains packages that serve as security, bugfix or enhancement updates, issued between the regular update sets for point releases. Bugfix and enhancement updates released this way are only those unsuitable to be released through the codice_3 repository described below.
* codice_4 : provides packages required for building the packages that make up the main CentOS distribution, but are not provided by the upstream.

The CentOS Project provides several additional repositories that contain software packages not provided by the default codice_1 and codice_2 repositories. Those repositories include the following:
* codice_7 : contains packages that provide additional functionality to CentOS without breaking its upstream compatibility or updating the base components.
* codice_8 : contains packages that actually upgrade certain base CentOS components, changing CentOS so that it is not exactly like the upstream provider&#x27;s content.
* codice_9 : serves as a proving ground for packages on their way to codice_8 and codice_7. Offered packages may or may not replace core CentOS packages, and are not guaranteed to work properly.
* codice_3 : contains bugfix and enhancement updates issued from time to time, between the regular update sets for point releases. The packages released this way serve as close candidates for the inclusion into the next point release. This repository does not provide security updates, and does not contain packages unsuitable for uncertain inclusion into point releases.
* codice_13 (Continuous Release) : makes generally available packages that will appear in the next point release of CentOS. The packages are made available on a testing and hotfix basis, until the actual point release is formally released in form of ISO images.
* codice_14 : Contains packages with debugging symbols generated when the primary packages were built.
* codice_15 : Contains packages contributed by CentOS users that do not overlap with any of the core distribution packages.
* codice_16 : Provides versions of software newer than those provided by the base distribution, see above for more details.

== CentOS Stream ==
CentOS Stream is a &quot;continuously delivered distro that tracks just ahead of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development, positioned as a midstream between Fedora Linux and RHEL.&quot; which is designed for &quot;anyone interested in participating and collaborating in the RHEL ecosystem&quot;.

Because prior CentOS releases were derived directly from RHEL (RHEL was essentially upstream of CentOS), Stream thus represents a change from prior CentOS releases, being situated between the upstream development in Fedora and the downstream development for RHEL. That said, CentOS Stream 9 and RHEL 9 started from the same codebase and thus CentOS Stream could reasonably be seen as &quot;closer&quot; to RHEL than Fedora.

The initial release, CentOS Stream 8, was released on 24 September 2019, at the same time as CentOS 8. As CentOS 8 became unsupported, The CentOS Project provided a simple means of converting from CentOS Linux 8 to CentOS Stream 8.

<text>A kinetochore (, ) is a flared oblique-shaped protein structure associated with duplicated chromatids in eukaryotic cells where the spindle fibers, which can be thought of as the ropes pulling chromosomes apart, attach during cell division to pull sister chromatids apart. The kinetochore assembles on the centromere and links the chromosome to microtubule polymers from the mitotic spindle during mitosis and meiosis. The term kinetochore was first used in a footnote in a 1934 Cytology book by Lester W. Sharp and commonly accepted in 1936. Sharp&#x27;s footnote reads: &quot;The convenient term &quot;kinetochore&quot; (= movement place) has been suggested to the author by J. A. Moore&quot;, likely referring to John Alexander Moore who had joined Columbia University as a freshman in 1932.

Monocentric organisms, including vertebrates, fungi, and most plants, have a single centromeric region on each chromosome which assembles a single, localized kinetochore. Holocentric organisms, such as nematodes and some plants, assemble a kinetochore along the entire length of a chromosome.

Kinetochores start, control, and supervise the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. During mitosis, which occurs after the amount of DNA is doubled in each chromosome (while maintaining the same number of chromosomes) in S phase, two sister chromatids are held together by a centromere. Each chromatid has its own kinetochore, which face in opposite directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle apparatus. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. The kinetochore is therefore essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis.

==Structure==

The kinetochore contains two regions:
* an inner kinetochore, which is tightly associated with the centromere DNA and assembled in a specialized form of chromatin that persists throughout the cell cycle;
* an outer kinetochore, which interacts with microtubules; the outer kinetochore is a very dynamic structure with many identical components, which are assembled and functional only during cell division.

Even the simplest kinetochores consist of more than 19 different proteins. Many of these proteins are conserved between eukaryotic species, including a specialized histone H3 variant (called CENP-A or CenH3) which helps the kinetochore associate with DNA. Other proteins in the kinetochore adhere it to the microtubules (MTs) of the mitotic spindle. There are also motor proteins, including both dynein and kinesin, which generate forces that move chromosomes during mitosis. Other proteins, such as Mad2, monitor the microtubule attachment as well as the tension between sister kinetochores and activate the spindle checkpoint to arrest the cell cycle when either of these is absent. The actual set of genes essential for kinetochore function varies from one species to another.

Kinetochore functions include anchoring of chromosomes to MTs in the spindle, verification of anchoring, activation of the spindle checkpoint and participation in the generation of force to propel chromosome movement during cell division. On the other hand, microtubules are metastable polymers made of α- and β-tubulin, alternating between growing and shrinking phases, a phenomenon known as &quot;dynamic instability&quot;. MTs are highly dynamic structures, whose behavior is integrated with kinetochore function to control chromosome movement and segregation. It has also been reported that the kinetochore organization differs between mitosis and meiosis and the integrity of meiotic kinetochore is essential for meiosis specific events such as pairing of homologous chromosomes, sister kinetochore monoorientation, protection of centromeric cohesin and spindle-pole body cohesion and duplication.

===In animal cells===

The kinetochore is composed of several layers, observed initially by conventional fixation and staining methods of electron microscopy, (reviewed by C. Rieder in 1982) and more recently by rapid freezing and substitution.
The deepest layer in the kinetochore is the inner plate, which is organized on a chromatin structure containing nucleosomes presenting a specialized histone (named CENP-A, which substitutes histone H3 in this region), auxiliary proteins, and DNA. DNA organization in the centromere (satellite DNA) is one of the least understood aspects of vertebrate kinetochores. The inner plate appears like a discrete heterochromatin domain throughout the cell cycle.

External to the inner plate is the outer plate, which is composed mostly of proteins. This structure is assembled on the surface of the chromosomes only after the nuclear envelope breaks down. The outer plate in vertebrate kinetochores contains about 20 anchoring sites for MTs (+) ends (named kMTs, after &quot;kinetochore MTs&quot;), whereas a kinetochore&#x27;s outer plate in yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) contains only one anchoring site.

The outermost domain in the kinetochore forms a fibrous corona, which can be visualized by conventional microscopy, yet only in the absence of MTs. This corona is formed by a dynamic network of resident and temporary proteins implicated in the spindle checkpoint, in microtubule anchoring, and in the regulation of chromosome behavior.

During mitosis, each sister chromatid forming the complete chromosome has its own kinetochore. Distinct sister kinetochores can be observed at first at the end of G2 phase in cultured mammalian cells. These early kinetochores show a mature laminar structure before the nuclear envelope breaks down. The molecular pathway for kinetochore assembly in higher eukaryotes has been studied using gene knockouts in mice and in cultured chicken cells, as well as using RNA interference (RNAi) in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot; and human cells, yet no simple linear route can describe the data obtained so far.
The first protein to be assembled on the kinetochore is CENP-A (Cse4 in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;). This protein is a specialized isoform of histone H3. CENP-A is required for incorporation of the inner kinetochore proteins CENP-C, CENP-H and CENP-I/MIS6. The relation of these proteins in the CENP-A-dependent pathway is not completely defined. For instance, CENP-C localization requires CENP-H in chicken cells, but it is independent of CENP-I/MIS6 in human cells. In &quot;C. elegans&quot; and metazoa, the incorporation of many proteins in the outer kinetochore depends ultimately on CENP-A.

Kinetochore proteins can be grouped according to their concentration at kinetochores during mitosis: some proteins remain bound throughout cell division, whereas some others change in concentration. Furthermore, they can be recycled in their binding site on kinetochores either slowly (they are rather stable) or rapidly (dynamic).
* Proteins whose levels remain stable from prophase until late anaphase include constitutive components of the inner plate and the stable components of the outer kinetocore, such as the Ndc80 complex, KNL/KBP proteins (&quot;kinetochore-null&quot;/&quot;KNL-binding protein&quot;), MIS proteins and CENP-F. Together with the constitutive components, these proteins seem to organize the nuclear core of the inner and outer structures in the kinetochore.
* The dynamic components that vary in concentration on kinetochores during mitosis include the molecular motors CENP-E and dynein (as well as their target components ZW10 and ROD), and the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1, Mad2, BubR1 and Cdc20). These proteins assemble on the kinetochore in high concentrations in the absence of microtubules; however, the higher the number of MTs anchored to the kinetochore, the lower the concentrations of these proteins. At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels diminish by a factor of about three to four as compared with free kinetochores, whereas dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 levels are reduced by a factor of more than 10 to 100.
* Whereas the spindle checkpoint protein levels present in the outer plate diminish as MTs anchor, other components such as EB1, APC and proteins in the Ran pathway (RanGap1 and RanBP2) associate to kinetochores only when MTs are anchored. This may belong to a mechanism in the kinetochore to recognize the microtubules&#x27; plus-end (+), ensuring their proper anchoring and regulating their dynamic behavior as they remain anchored.

A 2010 study used a complex method (termed &quot;multiclassifier combinatorial proteomics&quot; or MCCP) to analyze the proteomic composition of vertebrate chromosomes, including kinetochores. Although this study does not include a biochemical enrichment for kinetochores, obtained data include all the centromeric subcomplexes, with peptides from all 125 known centromeric proteins. According to this study, there are still about one hundred unknown kinetochore proteins, doubling the known structure during mitosis, which confirms the kinetochore as one of the most complex cellular substructures. Consistently, a comprehensive literature survey indicated that there had been at least 196 human proteins already experimentally shown to be localized at kinetochores.

== Function ==

The number of microtubules attached to one kinetochore is variable: in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals there can be 15–35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and they are responsible for spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores. The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.

===Chromosome anchoring to MTs in the mitotic spindle===

====Capturing MTs====
During the synthesis phase (S phase) in the cell cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just at the beginning of mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a &quot;minus&quot;(-) end relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a &quot;plus&quot;(+) end enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, in such a way that chromosomes are now &quot;bi-oriented&quot;, one fundamental configuration (also termed &quot;amphitelic&quot;) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.
When just one microtubule is anchored to one kinetochore, it starts a rapid movement of the associated chromosome towards the pole generating that microtubule. This movement is probably mediated by the motor activity towards the &quot;minus&quot; (-) of the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is very concentrated in the kinetochores not anchored to MTs. The movement towards the pole is slowed down as far as kinetochores acquire kMTs (MTs anchored to kinetochores) and the movement becomes directed by changes in kMTs length. Dynein is released from kinetochores as they acquire kMTs and, in cultured mammalian cells, it is required for the spindle checkpoint inactivation, but not for chromosome congression in the spindle equator, kMTs acquisition or anaphase A during chromosome segregation. In higher plants or in yeast there is no evidence of dynein, but other kinesins towards the (-) end might compensate for the lack of dynein.
Another motor protein implicated in the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a high molecular weight kinesin associated with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from prometaphase until anaphase. In cells with low levels of CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the metaphase plate. In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the metaphase plate.

It is widely accepted that the kMTs fiber (the bundle of microtubules bound to the kinetochore) is originated by the capture of MTs polymerized at the centrosomes and spindle poles in mammalian cultured cells. However, MTs directly polymerized at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The manner in which the centromeric region or kinetochore initiates the formation of kMTs and the frequency at which this happens are important questions, because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also to the way in which kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate the movement along kMTs.

====Role of Ndc80 complex====

MTs associated to kinetochores present special features: compared to free MTs, kMTs are much more resistant to cold-induced depolymerization, high hydrostatic pressures or calcium exposure. Furthermore, kMTs are recycled much more slowly than astral MTs and spindle MTs with free (+) ends, and if kMTs are released from kinetochores using a laser beam, they rapidly depolymerize.

When it was clear that neither dynein nor CENP-E is essential for kMTs formation, other molecules should be responsible for kMTs stabilization. Pioneer genetic work in yeast revealed the relevance of the Ndc80 complex in kMTs anchoring. In &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, the Ndc80 complex has four components: Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p. Mutants lacking any of the components of this complex show loss of the kinetochore-microtubule connection, although kinetochore structure is not completely lost. Yet mutants in which kinetochore structure is lost (for instance Ndc10 mutants in yeast) are deficient both in the connection to microtubules and in the ability to activate the spindle checkpoint, probably because kinetochores work as a platform in which the components of the response are assembled.

The Ndc80 complex is highly conserved and it has been identified in &quot;S. pombe&quot;, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;Xenopus&quot;, chicken and humans. Studies on Hec1 (&quot;highly expressed in cancer cells 1&quot;), the human homolog of Ndc80p, show that it is important for correct chromosome congression and mitotic progression, and that it interacts with components of the cohesin and condensin complexes.

Different laboratories have shown that the Ndc80 complex is essential for stabilization of the kinetochore-microtubule anchoring, required to support the centromeric tension implicated in the establishment of the correct chromosome congression in high eukaryotes. Cells with impaired function of Ndc80 (using RNAi, gene knockout, or antibody microinjection) have abnormally long spindles, lack of tension between sister kinetochores, chromosomes unable to congregate at the metaphase plate and few or any associated kMTs.

There is a variety of strong support for the ability of the Ndc80 complex to directly associate with microtubules and form the core conserved component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface. However, formation of robust kinetochore-microtubule interactions may also require the function of additional proteins. In yeast, this connection requires the presence of the complex Dam1-DASH-DDD. Some members of this complex bind directly to MTs, whereas some others bind to the Ndc80 complex. This means that the complex Dam1-DASH-DDD might be an essential adapter between kinetochores and microtubules. However, in animals an equivalent complex has not been identified, and this question remains under intense investigation.

===Verification of kinetochore–MT anchoring===
During S-Phase, the cell duplicates all the genetic information stored in the chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At the end of this process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister chromatid has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed &quot;amphitelic&quot; or &quot;bi-orientation&quot;.

However, during the anchoring process some incorrect configurations may also appear:
* monotelic: only one of the chromatids is anchored to MTs, the second kinetochore is not anchored; in this situation, there is no centromeric tension, and the spindle checkpoint is activated, delaying entry in anaphase and allowing time for the cell to correct the error. If it is not corrected, the unanchored chromatid might randomly end in any of the two daughter cells, generating aneuploidy: one daughter cell would have chromosomes in excess and the other would lack some chromosomes.
* syntelic: both chromatids are anchored to MTs emanating from the same pole; this situation does not generate centromeric tension either, and the spindle checkpoint will be activated. If it is not corrected, both chromatids will end in the same daughter cell, generating aneuploidy.
* merotelic: at least one chromatid is anchored simultaneously to MTs emanating from both poles. This situation generates centromeric tension, and for this reason the spindle checkpoint is not activated. If it is not corrected, the chromatid bound to both poles will remain as a lagging chromosome at anaphase, and finally will be broken in two fragments, distributed between the daughter cells, generating aneuploidy.

Both the monotelic and the syntelic configurations fail to generate centromeric tension and are detected by the spindle checkpoint. In contrast, the merotelic configuration is not detected by this control mechanism. However, most of these errors are detected and corrected before the cell enters in anaphase. A key factor in the correction of these anchoring errors is the chromosomal passenger complex, which includes the kinase protein Aurora B, its target and activating subunit INCENP and two other subunits, Survivin and Borealin/Dasra B (reviewed by Adams and collaborators in 2001). Cells in which the function of this complex has been abolished by dominant negative mutants, RNAi, antibody microinjection or using selective drugs, accumulate errors in chromosome anchoring. Many studies have shown that Aurora B is required to destabilize incorrect anchoring kinetochore-MT, favoring the generation of amphitelic connections. Aurora B homolog in yeast (Ipl1p) phosphorilates some kinetochore proteins, such as the constitutive protein Ndc10p and members of the Ndc80 and Dam1-DASH-DDD complexes. Phosphorylation of Ndc80 complex components produces destabilization of kMTs anchoring. It has been proposed that Aurora B localization is important for its function: as it is located in the inner region of the kinetochore (in the centromeric heterochromatin), when the centromeric tension is established sister kinetochores separate, and Aurora B cannot reach its substrates, so that kMTs are stabilized. Aurora B is frequently overexpressed in several cancer types, and it is currently a target for the development of anticancer drugs.

===Spindle checkpoint activation===
The spindle checkpoint, or SAC (for &quot;spindle assembly checkpoint&quot;), also known as the &quot;mitotic checkpoint&quot;, is a cellular mechanism responsible for detection of:
* correct assembly of the mitotic spindle;
* attachment of all chromosomes to the mitotic spindle in a bipolar manner;
* congression of all chromosomes at the metaphase plate.

When just one chromosome (for any reason) remains lagging during congression, the spindle checkpoint machinery generates a delay in cell cycle progression: the cell is arrested, allowing time for repair mechanisms to solve the detected problem. After some time, if the problem has not been solved, the cell will be targeted for apoptosis (programmed cell death), a safety mechanism to avoid the generation of aneuploidy, a situation which generally has dramatic consequences for the organism.

Whereas structural centromeric proteins (such as CENP-B), remain stably localized throughout mitosis (including during telophase), the spindle checkpoint components are assembled on the kinetochore in high concentrations in the absence of microtubules, and their concentrations decrease as the number of microtubules attached to the kinetochore increases.

At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels decreases 3 to 4 fold as compared to the levels at unattached kinetochores, whereas the levels of dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 decrease &gt;10-100 fold. Thus at metaphase, when all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, all checkpoint proteins are released from the kinetochore. The disappearance of the checkpoint proteins out of the kinetochores indicates the moment when the chromosome has reached the metaphase plate and is under bipolar tension. At this moment, the checkpoint proteins that bind to and inhibit Cdc20 (Mad1-Mad2 and BubR1), release Cdc20, which binds and activates APC/CCdc20, and this complex triggers sister chromatids separation and consequently anaphase entry.

Several studies indicate that the Ndc80 complex participates in the regulation of the stable association of Mad1-Mad2 and dynein with kinetochores. Yet the kinetochore associated proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-E, CENP-H and BubR1 are independent of Ndc80/Hec1. The prolonged arrest in prometaphase observed in cells with low levels of Ndc80/Hec1 depends on Mad2, although these cells show low levels of Mad1, Mad2 and dynein on kinetochores (&lt;10-15% in relation to unattached kinetochores). However, if both Ndc80/Hec1 and Nuf2 levels are reduced, Mad1 and Mad2 completely disappear from the kinetochores and the spindle checkpoint is inactivated.

Shugoshin (Sgo1, MEI-S332 in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) are centromeric proteins which are essential to maintain cohesin bound to centromeres until anaphase. The human homolog, hsSgo1, associates with centromeres during prophase and disappears when anaphase starts. When Shugoshin levels are reduced by RNAi in HeLa cells, cohesin cannot remain on the centromeres during mitosis, and consequently sister chromatids separate synchronically before anaphase initiates, which triggers a long mitotic arrest.

On the other hand, Dasso and collaborators have found that proteins involved in the Ran cycle can be detected on kinetochores during mitosis: RanGAP1 (a GTPase activating protein which stimulates the conversion of Ran-GTP in Ran-GDP) and the Ran binding protein called RanBP2/Nup358. During interphase, these proteins are located at the nuclear pores and participate in the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Kinetochore localization of these proteins seem to be functionally significant, because some treatments that increase the levels of Ran-GTP inhibit kinetochore release of Bub1, Bub3, Mad2 and CENP-E.

Orc2 (a protein that belongs to the origin recognition complex -ORC- implicated in DNA replication initiation during S phase) is also localized at kinetochores during mitosis in human cells; in agreement with this localization, some studies indicate that Orc2 in yeast is implicated in sister chromatids cohesion, and when it is eliminated from the cell, spindle checkpoint activation ensues. Some other ORC components (such orc5 in &quot;S. pombe&quot;) have been also found to participate in cohesion. However, ORC proteins seem to participate in a molecular pathway which is additive to cohesin pathway, and it is mostly unknown.

===Force generation to propel chromosome movement===
Most chromosome movements in relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One of the features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show &quot;directional instability&quot;, changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (&quot;poleward&quot;) or inversed (&quot;anti-poleward&quot;), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem to be part of a mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.

Kinetochore proteins and proteins binding to MTs (+) end (collectively called +TIPs) regulate kinetochore movement through the kMTs (+) end dynamics regulation. However, the kinetochore-microtubule interface is highly dynamic, and some of these proteins seem to be &quot;bona fide&quot; components of both structures. Two groups of proteins seem to be particularly important: kinesins which work like depolymerases, such as KinI kinesins; and proteins bound to MT (+) ends, +TIPs, promoting polymerization, perhaps antagonizing the depolymerases effect.
* KinI kinesins are named &quot;I&quot; because they present an internal motor domain, which uses ATP to promote depolymerization of tubulin polymer, the microtubule. In vertebrates, the most important KinI kinesin controlling the dynamics of the (+) end assembly is MCAK. However, it seems that there are other kinesins implicated.
* There are two groups of +TIPs with kinetochore functions.
** The first one includes the protein &quot;adenomatous polyposis coli&quot; (APC) and the associated protein EB1, which need MTs to localize on the kinetochores. Both proteins are required for correct chromosome segregation. EB1 binds only to MTs in polymerizing state, suggesting that it promotes kMTs stabilization during this phase.
** The second group of +TIPs includes proteins which can localize on kinetochores even in absence of MTs. In this group there are two proteins that have been widely studied: CLIP-170 and their associated proteins CLASPs (&quot;CLIP-associated proteins&quot;). CLIP-170 role at kinetochores is unknown, but the expression of a dominant negative mutant produces a prometaphase delay, suggesting that it has an active role in chromosome alignment. CLASPs proteins are required for chromosome alignment and maintenance of a bipolar spindle in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, humans and yeast.

<text>Beinwil am See is a municipality in the district of Kulm in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

With a population of 3,418 as of December 2020, it&#x27;s known for its diverse history dating back to the Neolithic era. It transitioned from a farming village to an industrial center over the years. At the present the town has a substantial production of cigars, candy, glass and mirrors, electric motors, electronics, and construction materials testing technology. The town came under the jurisdiction of the Canton of Aargau after the collapse of the Helvetic Republic in 1803.

&quot;Beinwil&quot; has an area of 3.84 square kilometers and is situated in the Seetal valley, near the western edge of Hallwilersee.

The local population is predominantly German-speaking, with a small percentage of Albanian and Italian speakers. The largest political party in the 2007 federal elections was the Swiss People&#x27;s Party.

The municipality also contains a UNESCO World Heritage Site—the prehistoric pile-dwelling (or stilt house) settlements around the Alps. The local rail services connect to Lucerne in the south and Lenzburg in the north.

==History==
There are traces of neolithic, Hallstatt, Roman and Alamanni settlements in or near Beinwil. However, Beinwil am See is first mentioned in 1036 as &quot;Beinwile&quot;. In 1045 it was mentioned as &quot;Peinuuilare&quot;. The noble von Beinwil family is first mentioned in 1153. This family was, in succession, vassals to the Lenzburg, Kyburg and Habsburgs before becoming extinct in the mid-14th century. The family castle has disappeared. The power of &quot;Zwing und Bann&quot; (Manor rights as well as low justice) over the village, were inherited in about 1300 by the Stewards of Wolhusen, then donated in 1501 to Beromünster, and sold in 1520 to Bern. The Counts of Hallwyl owned land on the lake (&quot;Dingstätte&quot;) to safeguard their maritime rights, which were first stipulated in 1419.

Starting with the conquest of the Aargau in 1415 by Bern, until the French conquest and creation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798, the rights to high and low justice were held by the bailiff in Lenzburg. Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic and the creation of the Canton of Aargau in the 1803 Act of Mediation, Beinwil came to the newly formed Canton.

Religiously it originally belonging to the Pfeffikon parish, though it had a chapel that predates written records. This chapel was demolished in 1852. In 1528 the Reformation entered the village and it joined the Reformed parish of Reinach. It has been a separate parish since 1932, and in 1935 the local parish church was consecrated. In 1964 the Roman Catholic Church of St. Martin was built in the municipality to service the growing diaspora community of Menziken-Reinach.

Economically, the decline in the 18th century of imported cotton processing was mitigated by the increasingly dominant tobacco industry (first factory in 1841). Today, the industrial focus of the municipality is the manufacture of cigars, candy, glass and mirrors, electric motors, electronics and technology for testing construction materials. In 1990 the secondary sector provided 42% of jobs, while the tertiary sector provided 53%. About 55% of the work force commuted into the municipality while 59% of the work force commuted away. Beinwil is a station on the &quot;Seetalbahn&quot; which runs from Lenzburg to Lucerne and also the Beinwil-Beromünster bus route.

<doc id="998898" wikidata="Q7352061" url="?curid=998898" title="Roberts v. City of Boston">
<text>Roberts v. Boston, 59 Mass. (5 Cush.) 198 (1850), was a court case seeking to end racial discrimination in Boston public schools. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in favor of Boston, finding no constitutional basis for the suit. The case was later cited by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which established the &quot;separate but equal&quot; standard.

The 2004 book, &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Long Walk: The Free Blacks of Boston and How Their Struggle for Equality Changed America,&quot; co-authored by Stephen and Paul Kendrick, explores this case, along with its social and political context.

==Overview==
&quot;Roberts v. Boston&quot; centered on Sarah C. Roberts, a five-year-old African-American girl. She was enrolled in Abiel Smith School, an underfunded all-black common school, far from her home in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father, Benjamin F. Roberts, also African-American, attempted to enroll her at closer, whites-only schools. After Sarah Roberts was denied on the basis of her race, and was physically removed from one school, her father wrote to the state legislature to seek a solution. Eventually, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts heard the case, in which Benjamin Roberts listed his daughter Sarah as the Plaintiff and the City of Boston as the Defendant. Not all African-Americans supported Roberts; most believed in &quot;separate but equal&quot; schooling and questioned the kind of education their children would receive from a white teacher. The defendant&#x27;s attorney was Peleg Chandler, the plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys were Charles Sumner and Robert Morris (one of the country&#x27;s first African-American lawyers), and the judge was Lemuel Shaw. Sumner noted the distance that Sarah had to travel and the psychological trauma the girl would experience having to go to an all-black, sub-standard school. Despite the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers&#x27; best efforts, Shaw ruled for the defendant.

Roberts brought the issue to the state legislature with Sumner&#x27;s help and in 1855, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts banned segregated schools in the state. This was the first law prohibiting segregated schools in the United States.

==Legacy==
*1896, &quot;Case of Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;: ruled in favor of &quot;separate but equal&quot; schools for blacks, citing the ruling in &quot;Roberts v. Boston&quot;
*1954, &quot;Case of Brown v. Board of Board of Education&quot;: ruled against &quot;separate but equal&quot;, citing Sumner&#x27;s arguments, and banned segregated schools nationwide.

<text>Thomas Dermody (1775–1802) was an Irish poet. He wrote under pseudonyms including Mauritius Moonshine, and Marmaduke Myrtle.

==Life==
Dermody was born in Ennis. He was scholarly but lived hard, and made little of his life. He spent some time as a soldier. He had the genius of a poet, and wrote fairly good poetry;but his genius was not enough. He lived for 27 years, half his life a promising boy and half a ne&#x27;er-do-well. His promise brought him, generous patrons, in his early days in Ireland, but he scorned the hand that fed him, denied the friends who would have nursed his genius, and ran away to England to keep bad company. Friend after friend he gained and lost. Patron after patron he abused. They clothed and cleaned him and made him presentable, but he would drink himself to nakedness and rags and behave like a brute. Such from day to day and year to year was his life, and in the end he drank himself to death and perished in a miserable cottage near Lewisham. He was filled with conceit and a slave to his desires, but the lines that are fading away on the stone above his grave show that he was a poet. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s church Lewisham.

Among his patrons were Dr. Houlton, of Trinity College, the actor Mr. Owenson, the schoolmaster Rev. Gilbert Austin (who in 1789 published a volume of Dermody’s poems at his own expense), a Mr. Atkinson and finally the Dowager Countess of Moira.

==Works==
Dermody published two books of poems, which after his death were collected as &quot;The Harp of Erin&quot;. Some 56 of his sonnets being published in various works, from his first 1789 collection &quot;Poems&quot; to those published in 1792, with a few posthumously published verses in the biography by James Grant Raymond. Samuel Taylor Coleridge took an interest in some of his verse which had been included in the literary magazine &quot;The Anthologia Hibernica&quot;.

<text>Johnny Gill Jr. (born May 22, 1966) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the sixth and final member of the R&amp;B/pop group New Edition and was also a member of the supergroup called LSG, with Gerald Levert and Keith Sweat. Gill has released eight solo albums, three albums with New Edition, two albums with LSG, and one collaborative album with Stacy Lattisaw. Gill has sold over 15 million copies worldwide as a solo artist.

== Early life ==
Gill was born on May 22, 1966, in Washington, D.C., the son of Johnny Gill Sr., a Baptist minister, and his wife, Annie Mae Gill, who had four boys. He started singing at the age of five, performing in church in a family gospel group called Little Johnny and &quot;Wings of Faith&quot;. The group included his brothers Bobby, Jeff, and Randy Gill, a solo recording artist and member of the group II D Extreme.

Gill attended Kimball Elementary, Sousa Junior High, and Duke Ellington School of the Arts. His career dictated that he complete his high-school education through the services of a tutor. Gill planned to attend college to pursue a degree in electrical engineering, but decided to focus on his singing career.

== Music career ==
=== Early career ===
Gill&#x27;s recording career began in 1982, at the age of 16, when his childhood friend Stacy Lattisaw convinced him to record a demo. This demo fell into the hands of the president of Atlantic Records, and his first self-titled debut album was released shortly thereafter on Atlantic subsidiary Cotillion Records. Gill then teamed up with Stacy for the duet album &quot;Perfect Combination&quot;. A second solo album on Cotillion Records, &quot;Chemistry&quot;, was released in 1985.

=== New Edition ===
Gill began a new chapter in his career in 1987, when he was recruited by Michael Bivins to join New Edition. Bobby Brown had been voted out of the group and Gill was brought in to replace lead singer Ralph Tresvant, who was rumored at the time to be leaving to pursue a solo career. Gill became the only member of New Edition who was not from Boston. With Gill, the oldest member, as one of the lead singers (along with Tresvant, who ended up staying with New Edition and delaying the launch of his solo career) on the album &quot;Heart Break&quot;, the group developed a more mature, adult sound, hitting the charts with songs such as &quot;Can You Stand The Rain&quot;, &quot;N.E. Heartbreak&quot;, &quot;If It Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;, and the Gill-led &quot;Boys to Men&quot;.

=== Solo career ===
Continuing his role as a romantic balladeer while emerging as a new jack swing star, he released a self-titled third album in 1990, which included the hits &quot;My, My, My&quot;, &quot;Rub You the Right Way&quot;, &quot;Fairweather Friend&quot;, and &quot;Wrap My Body Tight&quot;.

In 1993, Gill released another solo project, &quot;Provocative&quot;, which included the songs &quot;Quiet Time to Play&quot;, &quot;A Cute, Sweet, Love Addiction&quot;, and the gospel song, &quot;I Know Where I Stand&quot;.

In 1996, Gill released &quot;Let&#x27;s Get the Mood Right&quot;, which included the song, &quot;Love In an Elevator&quot;, and the single &quot;Maybe&quot;. The same year, Johnny reunited with New Edition and recorded the album &quot;Home Again&quot;.

=== LSG ===
In 1997, he collaborated with Gerald Levert and Keith Sweat to form the supergroup &quot;LSG&quot; (Levert-Sweat-Gill), which yielded the multi-platinum debut album &quot;Levert.Sweat.Gill&quot; and the trio’s final album &quot;LSG2&quot; in 2003. In 2004, he reunited with New Edition; it signed with Bad Boy Records and released the album &quot;One Love&quot;, which included the single &quot;Hot 2Nite&quot;.

=== Return to solo career ===
In 2011, 15 years after recording his last solo album, Gill returned with &quot;Still Winning&quot;, which included &quot;In the Mood&quot;, &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;It Would Be You&quot;, and &quot;2nd Place&quot;. In 2014, Gill left Fontana Records and started his own label, J Skillz Records, on which he released the album &quot;Game Changer&quot;. The album produced several adult R&amp;B radio hits, including the singles &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and the title track, &quot;Game Changer&quot;. His New Edition bandmates appear on &quot;This One&#x27;s for Me and You&quot;. Gill joined Fantasia as an opener for Charlie Wilson&#x27;s In It to Win It tour, which kicked off in February 2017. On September 6, 2019, Gill released his album &quot;Game Changer II&quot;. Beginning in 2023, Gill enjoyed a resurgence of popularity with his song, &quot;Rub You the Right Way&quot; on the popular social media app TikTok, with various influencers using the song for their videos.

== Acting career ==
Gill has had over 80 television and film appearances as a singer and actor. He had a cameo role on the TV show &quot;Family Matters&quot;, and sang &quot;You For Me&quot; in the 2006 movie &quot;Madea&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot;. Gill starred in the 2009 stage play &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, alongside Robin Givens, Shirley Murdock, and Jermaine Crawford.

== Awards and accolades ==
Grammy Awards

Gill has received two Grammy Award nominations: one with New Edition and one as a solo artist.

In 1991, Gill won two Soul Train Awards: for Best R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Album of the Year – Male (for &quot;Johnny Gill&quot;) and for Best R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Single (for &quot;My My My&quot;).

In 2019, Gill won the SoulTracks Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Album of the Year (for &quot;Game Changer II&quot;).

<text>Haguenau (; or ; ; historical ) is a commune in the Bas-Rhin department of France, of which it is a sub-prefecture.

It is second in size in the Bas-Rhin only to Strasbourg, some to the south. To the north of the town, the Forest of Haguenau is the largest undivided forest in France.

Haguenau was founded by German dukes and has swapped back and forth several times between Germany and France over the centuries, with its spelling altering between &quot;Hagenau&quot; and &quot;Haguenau&quot; by the turn. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Haguenau was ceded to the new German Empire. It was part of the German Empire for 48 years from 1871 to 1918, when at the end of World War I it was returned to France. This transfer was officially ratified in 1919 with the Treaty of Versailles.

Haguenau is a rapidly growing town, its population having increased from 22,944 inhabitants in 1968 to 34,504 inhabitants in 2017. Haguenau&#x27;s functional urban area has grown from 54,415 inhabitants in 1968 to 75,933 inhabitants in 2017.

==History==

Haguenau dates from the beginning of the 12th century, when Duke Frederick II the One-Eyed (1090 – 6 April 1147) of Swabia erected a hunting lodge on an island in the river Moder. The medieval King and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa fortified the settlement and gave it town rights, important for further development, in 1154. On the site of the hunting lodge he founded an imperial palace he regarded as his favourite residence. In this palace were preserved the &quot;Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;, i.e. the jewelled imperial crown, sceptre, imperial orb, and sword of Charlemagne.

Richard of Cornwall, King of the Romans, made it an imperial city in 1257. Subsequently, through Rudolph I of Germany — the first Habsburg emperor — Haguenau became the seat of the of Hagenau, the German imperial advocate in Lower Alsace. In the 14th century, it housed the executive council of the Decapole, a defensive and offensive association of ten Alsatian towns against external aggression, economic expansion and related political instability. In the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Alsace was ceded to France, which had repeatedly invaded and looted the region in the past. In 1673 King Louis XIV had the fortifications as well as the remains of the king&#x27;s palace razed in order to extinguish German traditions. Haguenau was recaptured by German troops in 1675, but was taken again by the French two years later, when it was nearly destroyed by fire set by looting French troops.

In 1793 Prussians and Austrians had occupied Lower Alsace from the Lauter to Moder to support the Royalists and before the year&#x27;s end were driven back over the border by the French Revolutionary Army, causing the “great flight”.

In 1871, Haguenau was ceded to the German Empire upon its victory in the Franco-Prussian War; the community was made part of Alsace-Lorraine, with its Germanic spelling–&quot;Hagenau&quot;–restored.

The Haguenau Airport was built in 1916 by the German military to train fighter and bomber pilots to fight in the First World War.

Hagenau was part of the briefly independent Republic of Alsace-Lorraine after World War I, before being returned to France in 1919.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War, Germany retook the town in 1940. In November 1944 the area surrounding Haguenau was under the control of the 256th Volksgrenadier Division under the command of General Gerhard Franz.

On 1 December 1944, the 314th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division, XV Corps, 7th U.S. Army, moved into the area near Haguenau, and on 7 December the regiment was given the assignment to take it and the town forest just north that included German ammunition dumps. The attack began at 0645 on 9 December, and sometime during the night of 10 December and the early morning of 11 December the Germans withdrew under the cover of darkness, leaving the town proper largely under American control.

Before they withdrew, the Germans demolished bridges, useful buildings, and even the town park. However, as experienced by Haguenau throughout its history, the Germans came back and retook the town in late January. Most of the inhabitants fled with the assistance of the U.S. Army. The Americans launched an immediate counterattack to retake the town. The 313th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division was relieved by the 101st Airborne Division on 5 February 1945. The 36th Infantry Division would relieve the 101st on 23 February 1945. On 15 March the Allied Operation Undertone, a combined effort of the U.S. Seventh and French 1st Armies of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, was launched to drive the Germans back along a 75 km line from Saarbrücken to Haguenau. The last German soldier was not cleared out of the town until 19 March 1945, after house-to-house fighting.

Much of the town had been destroyed despite the Allied reluctance to use artillery to clear out the Germans. Technical Sergeant Morris E. Crain, Company E, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for providing covering fire for his men on 13 March 1945.

==Population==

==Economy==
The town has a well balanced economy. Centuries of troubled history in the buffer lands between France and Germany have given Haguenau a rich historical and cultural heritage which supports a lively tourist trade. There is also a thriving light manufacturing sector centred on the industrial zone to the west of the town. Here the presence nearby of significant retail developments testifies to Haguenau&#x27;s importance as a regional commercial centre. The recent extension of the ring road has improved access to the commercial and industrial zones and reduced the traffic congestion which used to be a frequent challenge for vehicle drivers using the road which follows the line of the old town walls on the western side of town.

===Architecture===
In spite of the extensive destruction Haguenau suffered during the many wars experienced by Alsace, especially the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the French conquest in 1677 and the Second World War, it still possesses monuments from nine centuries, even if nothing is left of arguably the most prestigious of them, Frederick I Barbarossa&#x27;s imperial palace (&quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot;).

Medieval Haguenau retains three gates from its former fortification, the &quot;Tour des Chevaliers&quot; (Tower of the knights), the &quot;Tour des Pêcheurs&quot; (Tower of the fishermen) and the &quot;Porte de Wissembourg&quot; (Wissembourg gate), two fairly large Gothic churches, Saint-Georges and Saint-Nicolas, an ancient water-mill and the old custom-house (&quot;Ancienne Douane&quot;). Both Saint-Georges and Saint-Nicolas Church have lost many of their artistic treasures over the centuries, especially their medieval stained glass windows and outside sculptures. Still, both display to this day some fine liturgical furniture (altars, choir stalls, organ cases, church tabernacles, calvaries...). Saint-Nicolas has become the receptacle for the baroque wooden decoration of the church of the destroyed Neubourg Abbey nearby.

French Baroque and classicism has bequeathed the town several buildings, among which the former hospital and the current town hall. The Synagogue (1820) is a fine example of French Neo-classicism, as is the theatre (&quot;Théâtre municipal&quot;) (1846). The large Hop hall (&quot;Halle au houblon&quot;) is a good example of historicism in architecture. It was built by the French in 1867 and extended twice by the Germans, in 1881 and 1908.

The Basilica of Our Lady in the locality of Marienthal is a vast Gothic Revival sanctuary (1863–1866). It keeps two early 15th-century statues, and a host of sculptures from around 1519.

Haguenau&#x27;s streets are adorned by attractive fountains, the medieval Saint-Georges fountain, the 18th-century Bee fountain (&quot;Fontaine aux abeilles&quot;) and the 1825 Dolphin fountain (&quot;Fontaine aux dauphins&quot;).

<text>Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789–1864) was an English liberal critic and writer on literature.

==Professional life ==
He served for many years in the Navy Pay-Office, on retiring from which in 1830 he devoted himself to literary pursuits.

== Literary life==
His liberal political views and literary interests brought him into contact with Leigh Hunt, the editor of &quot;The Examiner&quot;. He had in 1814–16 made a continuation of Robert Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Collection of English Plays&quot;, and in 1829 he became part proprietor and editor of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; magazine, the influence of which he greatly extended. In 1846 he resigned the editorship, and assumed that of &quot;The Daily News&quot;, but contributed to &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; papers on Alexander Pope, Edmund Burke, Junius, and others. His grandson, Sir Charles Dilke, published these writings in 1875 under the title, &quot;Papers of a Critic&quot;. Thanks to his grandson, Dilke is also acknowledged as the author of &quot;&quot;, published anonymously in 1821, which exercised an important influence on Marx.

== Wentworth Place==
Around October 1816, Dilke and his friend Charles Armitage Brown moved into a pair of semi-detached houses later called Wentworth Place in Hampstead, London. The poet John Keats lived with Brown around 1818–20 and was well known to Dilke. In 1822 Brown moved to Italy, selling his share of the property to Dilke. Today Wentworth Place is known as Keats House and is a museum to John Keats.

==Personal life==
Dilke married Maria Walker (1790–1850), daughter of an official in the East India Company, on 10 October 1806. They had one child, (Charles) Wentworth Dilke (1810–1869). After her death and that of his daughter-in-law in 1853, he devoted increasing time to the upbringing of his grandson and namesake, the future cabinet minister and the 2nd Baronet.

<text>William Hepworth Dixon (30 June 1821 – 26 December 1879) was an English historian and traveller from Manchester. He was active in organizing London&#x27;s Great Exhibition of 1851.

==Early life==
Dixon was born on 30 June 1821, at Great Ancoats in Manchester to Abner Dixon of Holmfirth and Kirkburton in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Mary Cryer. His uncle, Elijah Dixon, was the reform campaigner and manufacturer. He spent his boyhood in the hill country of Over Darwen, being schooled by a great-uncle, Michael Beswick. As a lad he became clerk to a Manchester merchant named Thompson.

==Man of letters==
Early in 1846 Dixon decided on a literary career. He was for two months editor of the &quot;Cheltenham Journal&quot;. While there he won two main essay prizes in Madden&#x27;s &quot;Prize Essay Magazine&quot;. In the summer of 1846, he was advised by Douglas Jerrold to move to London. He entered the Inner Temple, but was not called to the bar until 1 May 1854 and never practised.

About 1850 Dixon became a deputy commissioner of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and started over 100 of 300 committees formed. After a tour in Europe, Dixon became in January 1853 editor of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, to which he had been contributing, and remained so until 1869.

==Traveller==

Dixon travelled in 1861 to Portugal, Spain and Morocco, and then in 1863 eastwards, returning to help in founding the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he became an executive committee member and eventually chairman. In 1866 he travelled through the United States as far west as Salt Lake City. On the tour he lit upon a collection of state papers, originally Irish, in the public library at Philadelphia, which had been missing since the time of James II; on Dixon&#x27;s suggestion it was passed to the British government.

In the autumn of 1867 Dixon travelled in the Baltic provinces, then in the latter part of 1869 spent some months in Russia and in 1871 mostly in Switzerland. Thereafter he was sent to Spain on a financial mission by a council of foreign bondholders. On 4 October 1872 he was created a knight commander of the Crown by Kaiser Wilhelm I. In September 1874 he travelled through North America, and in the latter part of 1875 once more in Italy and Germany.

==Politician and activist==
At the general election of 1868 Dixon declined an invitation to stand for Marylebone, though he often addressed political meetings. In August 1869 he resigned the editorship of the &quot;Athenæum&quot;. Soon afterwards he was appointed a justice of the peace for Middlesex and Westminster.

Dixon took a lead in establishing the Shaftesbury Park Estate, begun in 1872. This was intended to improve housing conditions for working-class residents. He supported a number of similar projects aimed at providing low-cost dwellings of decent standard for the families of labourers, and was a member of the first School Board for London (1870), working intensively on it in the first three years of its existence. Opposing Lord Sandon, he managed to carry a resolution establishing military-style foot drill as a form of physical education in all rate-paid schools in London.

About 1873 Dixon began campaigning to open the Tower of London free of charge to the public. To this the prime minister Benjamin Disraeli assented, and on public holidays Dixon personally conducted crowds of working men through the building.

==Later life==
Dixon lost most of his savings, invested in Turkish stock. On 2 October 1874 his house near Regent&#x27;s Park, 6 St. James&#x27;s Terrace, was wrecked by an explosion of gunpowder on Regent&#x27;s Canal. He lost his eldest daughter, and his eldest son, William Jerrold Dixon, to a sudden death in Dublin, on 20 October 1879. However, his youngest daughter, Ella Hepworth Dixon, became a writer, editor and novelist of repute.

Dixon was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Pennsylvania Society and other learned bodies. Before the end of 1878 he visited Cyprus, where a fall from a horse broke his shoulder bone and left him an invalid. He was revising the proof sheets of the final volumes of &quot;Royal Windsor&quot; and on Friday 26 December 1879, made an effort to finish the work. He died in his bed on the following morning from a seizure. He was buried on 2 January 1880 on the western side of Highgate cemetery.

==Works==
Before he was of age, Dixon wrote a five-act tragedy, &quot;The Azamoglan&quot;, which was privately printed. In 1842–1843 he wrote articles signed W. H. D. in the &quot;North of England Magazine&quot;. In December 1843 he first used his own name in Douglas Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;Illuminated Magazine&quot;. He became a contributor to the &quot;Athenæum&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;.

===Discoveries and history===
Dixon was criticised for inaccuracy as an author. However, he published in the &quot;Daily News&quot; a series of startling papers on &quot;The Literature of the Lower Orders&quot;, which may have suggested Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;. Another series, descriptive of the &quot;London Prisons&quot;, led to his work, &quot;John Howard and the Prison World of Europe&quot;, which appeared in 1849, and though declined by many publishers then passed through three editions.

Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Life of William Penn&quot; was published in 1851; in a supplementary chapter, &quot;Macaulay&#x27;s charges against Penn&quot;, eight in number, were elaborately answered. Thomas Babington Macaulay never took note of these criticisms.

In 1852 Dixon published a life of &quot;Robert Blake, Admiral and General at Sea, based on Family and State Papers&quot;. In 1854 he began research on Francis Bacon. He had leave through Lord Stanley and Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton to inspect the &quot;State Papers&quot;, until then guarded from general view by successive secretaries of state. He published four articles criticising John Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Bacon&quot; in the &quot;Athenæum&quot; for January 1860. These were expanded and republished as &quot;The Personal History of Lord Bacon from Unpublished Papers&quot; in 1861. He published separately as a pamphlet in 1861 &quot;A Statement of the Facts in regard to Lord Bacon&#x27;s Confession&quot;, and a more elaborate volume called &quot;The Story of Lord Bacon&#x27;s Life&quot;, 1862. Dixon&#x27;s books on Bacon have not been valued by scholars.

Some of Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Athenæum&quot; papers led to publication of the &quot;Auckland Memoirs&quot; and of &quot;Court and Society&quot;, edited by the Duke of Manchester. To the latter he contributed a memoir of Queen Catherine.

In 1869 Dixon brought out the first two volumes of &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Tower&quot;, which he completed two years later third and fourth volumes. While in Spain Dixon wrote most of his &quot;History of Two Queens&quot;, i.e. Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. This expanded into four volumes, the first half, published in 1873, containing the life of Catherine of Aragon, and the second half in 1874 that of Anne Boleyn. In 1878 appeared the first two volumes of his four-volume &quot;Royal Windsor&quot;.

===Religion===
Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Spiritual Wives&quot; (1868), treating partly on Mormonism, was accused of indecency. He brought a libel action against the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which had made the charge in a review of &quot;Free Russia&quot;. He was awarded a derogatory farthing in damages on 29 November 1872.

===Travel===
In 1865 Dixon published &quot;The Holy Land&quot;, a picturesque handbook to Palestine. In 1867 he published his &quot;New America&quot;, which went through eight editions in England, three in America, and several in France, Russia, Holland, Italy, and Germany. In 1872 came &quot;The Switzers&quot;. In March 1875 he wrote on North America in &quot;The White Conquest&quot;. Other books of travel were &quot;Free Russia&quot; (1870), and &quot;British Cyprus&quot; (1879).

===Novels===
In 1877 Dixon published his first romance, in 3 volumes: &quot;Diana, Lady Lyle&quot;. Another three-volume work of fiction followed in 1878: &quot;Ruby Grey&quot;.

===Other works===
During a panic in 1851 Dixon brought out an anonymous pamphlet, &quot;The French in England, or Both Sides of the Question on Both Sides of the Channel&quot;, arguing against the possibility of a French invasion. In 1861 he edited the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Sydney, Lady Morgan, who had appointed him her literary executor. During 1876 he wrote in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; &quot;The Way to Egypt&quot; and two other papers recommending the government to purchase its Egyptian suzerainty from the Ottoman Empire., In the same year 1876 he wrote a series of 5 articles about how and why Jew can and should recover Palestine, the articles are:

1- &quot;!- Holy land and City&quot;

2- &quot;II - The Temple&quot;

3- &quot;III - Underground Jerusalem&quot;

4- &quot; Foundations of Zion&quot;

5- &quot; Scenarios of the Baptism&quot;

In 1872 under the pseudonym Onslow Yorke he published an exposé of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, &quot;The Secret History of &quot;The International&quot; Working Men&#x27;s Association&quot;. After the Bolshevik Revolution it was republished by the British far right in 1921.

==Family life==
Dixon&#x27;s daughter, Ella Nora Hepworth Dixon, best known as Margaret Wynman, was a novelist and journalist.

<doc id="998909" wikidata="Q880265" url="?curid=998909" title="Richard Coke">
<text>Richard Coke (March 18, 1829May 14, 1897) was an American lawyer and statesman from Waco, Texas. He was the 15th governor of Texas from 1874 to 1876 and was a US Senator from 1877 to 1895. His governorship is notable for reestablishing local white supremacist rule in Texas, and the disfranchisement of African American voters, following Reconstruction. Richard Coke was revered by many Texas Southern Democrats due to his perceived triumphs over Reconstruction era Federal control in Texas politics. His uncle was US Representative Richard Coke Jr..

==Early life and education==
Richard Coke was born in 1829 in Williamsburg, Virginia, to John and Eliza (Hankins) Coke. Octavius Coke was his brother. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1848 with a law degree.

==Confederacy and Early Career==
In 1850, Coke moved to Texas and opened a law practice in Waco. In 1852, he married Mary Horne of Waco. The couple had four children, but all of them died before age 30.

In 1859, Coke was appointed by governor Hardin R. Runnels to lead a commission tasked with removing the remaining Comanche natives from West Texas and the Texas Hill Country.

Coke was a delegate to the Secession Convention at Austin in 1861. The convention&#x27;s chief concern was keeping slavery legal. Coke owned slaves himself. He voted that Texas should leave the United States to join the Confederacy.

He joined the Confederate Army as a private. In 1862, he raised a company that became part of the 15th Texas Infantry and served as its captain for the rest of the war. He was wounded in an action known as Bayou Bourbeau on November 3, 1863, near Opelousas, Louisiana. After the war, he returned home to Waco.

==Reconstruction==
In 1865, Coke was appointed a Texas district court judge, and in 1866, he was elected as an associate justice to the Texas Supreme Court. The following year, the military Governor-General Philip Sheridan removed Coke and four other judges as &quot;an impediment to reconstruction&quot;, in pursuit of unionist Reconstruction policies. The removal of the five judges became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and made their names famous, synonymous in the public eye with resistance to Union occupation.

Richard Coke leveraged resentment at Union occupation to construct a Democratic electoral coalition that ruled Texas for more than 100 years. Through Ku Klux Klan attacks, intimidation, and public lynching of Black voters and their white allies, Coke&#x27;s coalition re-established conservative white control of Texas in the 1870s. Disfranchisement of Black Texans was maintained with poll taxes and white primaries. The number of black voters decreased sharply from more than 100,000 in the 1890s to 5,000 in 1906.

Having been removed by Sheridan, Coke ran for governor as a Democrat in 1873 and took office in January 1874. The Texas Supreme Court ruled his election invalid in an extraordinary &quot;habeas corpus&quot; writ called &quot;Ex Parte Rodriguez&quot; because the polls were open for only one day, rather than the four days mentioned in the state constitution. The court is known as the &quot;Semicolon Court&quot; because the meaning of a particular semicolon in the constitution was important in the case. As recounted by the Texas State Historical Association, in response,

Disregarding the court ruling, the Democrats secured the keys to the second floor of the Capitol and took possession. [Incumbent Gov. Edmund] Davis was reported to have state troops stationed on the lower floor. The Travis Rifles (a Texas military unit created to fight Indians), summoned to protect Davis, were converted into a sheriff&#x27;s posse and protected Coke. On January 15, 1874, Coke was inaugurated as governor. On January 16, Davis arranged for a truce, but he made one final appeal for federal intervention. A telegram from President Ulysses S. Grant said that he did not feel warranted in sending federal troops to keep Davis in office. Davis resigned his office on January 19. Coke&#x27;s inauguration restored Democratic control in Texas.

Coke&#x27;s administration was marked by vigorous action to balance the budget and by a revised state constitution adopted in 1876. He was also instrumental in creating the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, which became Texas A&amp;M University. Having once been removed from the Texas Supreme Court, as governor, he appointed all its members, naming as Chief Justice Oran Roberts (after the US Senate had refused to seat him). George F. Moore, who was Chief Justice when he had been fired along with Coke, became the first chief justice elected under Texas&#x27; 1876 Constitution, an honor he held until his death. Others from the Texas judiciary under the Confederacy received key appointments.

Once the new Constitution had been negotiated, Coke resigned his office in December 1876, following his election by the legislature to the United States Senate. By the time of his resignation, Texas Democrats had united with white supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to maintain political control of the state.

==Later life and death==

Coke was re-elected to federal office in 1882 and 1888, serving in the 45th – 53rd Congresses until March 3, 1895. Coke was not a candidate for reelection in 1894.

Coke retired to his home in Waco and his nearby farm. He became ill with &quot;progressive paralysis&quot; in early 1897. After a few weeks of illness, he died at his home in Waco and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Coke&#x27;s rise to power marked the return of locally elected government in Texas and the establishment of a rigidly white supremacist Texas Democratic party that would maintain a strong hold on Texas government for over 100 years. Historians in the state praised Coke for this, and consolidated a version of Texas history that downplayed or omitted the liberal government that had preceded him. In 1916 the state archivist wrote:

The 1876 constitution created under Coke&#x27;s administration is the current Constitution of Texas. Coke County in West Texas is named for him.

<doc id="998911" wikidata="Q380064" url="?curid=998911" title="Endocrine surgery">
<text>Endocrine surgery is a surgical sub-speciality focusing on surgery of the endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland, the parathyroid glands, the adrenal glands, glands of the endocrine pancreas, and some neuroendocrine glands.

== Types ==

=== Thyroid surgery ===
Surgery of the thyroid gland constitutes the bulk of endocrine surgical procedures worldwide. This may be done for a variety of conditions, help ranging from benign multinodular goiter to thyroid cancer. In the United Kingdom it was developed as a separate specialty from general surgery by Richard Welbourne and John Lynn, surgeons at what was then the &#x27;Royal Postgraduate Medical School&#x27; and is now the Hammersmith Hospital and contains the Department of Thyroid and Endocrine Surgery staffed by consultant surgeons Professor Fausto Palazzo, Professor Neil Tolley and Miss Aimee Di Marco.
Operations involve removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) either as a part of the gland (lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy), or the whole gland (total thyroidectomy). Incomplete resections (sub-total or near total thyroidectomy) are also infrequently performed, but are disfavored by most surgeons.

=== Parathyroid surgery ===
Removal of the parathyroid gland(s) is referred to as parathyroidectomy and is most commonly performed for primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy is also performed to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism arising from chronic kidney failure.

=== Adrenal surgery ===
Adrenalectomy, the surgical removal of the adrenal gland, is performed to treat conditions including Conn syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and adreno-cortical cancer.

=== Pancreatic surgery ===
Diseases of the endocrine pancreas occur very infrequently; these include insulinomas, gastrinomas etc. Surgery for these conditions range from simple tumor enucleation to more larger resections.

==Development==

Endocrine surgery is generally well developed. Endocrine surgery has developed as a sub-specialty surgical category because of the technical nature of these operations and the associated risks of operating in the neck. In &quot;Surgery: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence&quot;, the book the efficacy prior research:

In the 1970s, a specialty training program at Hammersmith Hospital was the primary location for early work in training a large number of surgeons. It is well established that complications are much less common if performed by surgeons who do at least 100 thyroid operations per year. In the United Kingdom most thyroid surgery is performed by surgeons doing less than 20 thyroid operations per year. Permanent damage to both voice box nerves is an extreme rarity and needs in most cases a permanent tracheostomy. Data on the outcomes of all surgeons performing endocrine surgery in the UK is publicly available via the &#x27;British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons&#x27; website.

== Technique ==

=== Thyroid surgery ===
Some surgical teams leave wound drains in place after surgery to the thyroid gland. There is no strong evidence that wound drains improve outcomes following surgery and there is low-quality evidence that wound drains increase the length of time a person stays in the hospital following thyroid surgery.

<doc id="998912" wikidata="Q1383872" url="?curid=998912" title="Gerald Levert">
<text>Gerald Edward Levert (July 13, 1966 – November 10, 2006) was an American singer-songwriter and producer. Levert performed with his brother, Sean Levert, and friend Marc Gordon with the R&amp;B vocal group, LeVert. Levert was also a member of LSG, a supergroup comprising Keith Sweat, Johnny Gill, and himself. Levert was the son of Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&amp;B/soul vocal group the O&#x27;Jays. He released nine solo albums, six as a member of LeVert, two with his father, and two as a member of LSG. Levert was also credited with the discovery of R&amp;B groups the Rude Boys, Men at Large, and 1 of the Girls. Levert was also part of the R&amp;B groups Black Men United and LSG.

==Early life and education==
Levert was born on July 13, 1966, in Philadelphia, to the frontman of the O&#x27;Jays, Eddie Levert, and his wife Martha. He grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.

Levert often joined his father and his band on the road for their various performances. While in high school, Levert&#x27;s inclination towards music became apparent when he formed the trio LeVert, with his younger brother Sean Levert (September 28, 1968 – March 30, 2008) and friend Marc Gordon in 1983.

==Singing career==
Four of LeVert&#x27;s seven albums went gold.

Levert&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Private Line&quot;, debuted in 1991 and topped the R&amp;B charts. The following year, Gerald and his father, Eddie Levert, topped the R&amp;B charts again with the single, &quot;Baby Hold On to Me&quot;. Levert recorded a string of albums throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, that contained the hit singles, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About It&quot; (No. 12 Pop) which was released June 23, 1998, &quot;Taking Everything&quot; (No. 11 Pop), &quot;Funny&quot;, &quot;Mr. Too Damn Good to You&quot;, &quot;U Got That Love&quot;, and a remake of R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;, along with gospel singer Yolanda Adams. Levert also sang lead vocals in two songs on the 2002 film documentary &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; - the story of the Funk Brothers. Levert performed &quot;Shotgun&quot; and &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. Levert released his tenth album, &quot;Voices&quot;, in 2005.

Levert wrote and produced songs for other artists such as Patti LaBelle, Barry White, Stephanie Mills, Anita Baker, Eugene Wilde, Teddy Pendergrass, James Ingram, Freddie Jackson, Chuckii Booker, the Rude Boys, New Edition, Men at Large, The O&#x27;Jays, Keith Washington and 1 of the Girls. During the release of &quot;Groove On&quot;, Levert appeared in the group Black Men United for the hit single &quot;U Will Know&quot; for the &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot; soundtrack; other members of the group included Keith Sweat, Christopher Williams and Levert&#x27;s former mentor Joe Little of the Rude Boys. In 1997, Levert teamed up again with fellow singers Keith Sweat and Johnny Gill, to form the supergroup, LSG. The trio released the album &quot;Levert.Sweat.Gill&quot; the same year, selling over two million copies; it was followed by &quot;LSG2&quot; in 2003.

In 1999, Levert sang the chorus on the Chris Rock spoken-word comedy piece, &quot;No Sex (In the Champagne Room)&quot;. Levert performed a duet with Teena Marie on the latter&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;La Doña&quot;. Levert&#x27;s last collaborations included Jim Brickman on the song &quot;My Angel&quot;, for Brickman&#x27;s 2006 album entitled &quot;Escape&quot; and on the song &quot;Real S***&quot; from rapper Styles P&#x27;s album, &quot;Time Is Money&quot;. Levert was posthumously featured again on former groupmates Keith Sweat&#x27;s &quot;Knew It All Along&quot; and Johnny Gill from the singer&#x27;s &quot;Til the Morning&quot; album, which was released two days before Levert&#x27;s fifth anniversary of his death. Levert was also posthumously featured on Keith Sweat&#x27;s track &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; from his 2016 studio album &quot;Dress to Impress&quot;.

==Acting career==
Levert began his acting career as Charles Young, his first appearance on &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot; for 2 episodes with &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;, that aired on November 5, 1998, and Jamie disapproves of his mother (Jo Marie Payton) because she decided to marry him in the episode. In January 2001, Gerald appears again in the series finale &quot;Always and Forever&quot; when Jamie (Jamie Foxx) and Fancy (Garcelle Beauvais) got married and sang the opening ceremony at the wedding and joined by fellow singers Gladys Knight and Marilyn McCoo (without her husband Billy Davis Jr.). On November 10, 2003 (exactly three years prior to his death), Levert&#x27;s final acting role that aired during his lifetime was when he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Parkers&quot;, He played T&#x27;s father in the episode and comes for a visit to start a new band 

==Death==
On November 10, 2006, Levert was found dead in his bed at his home in Cleveland, Ohio, at age 40 Initial reports stated that Levert had died of an apparent heart attack, but the autopsy report conducted by the Cuyahoga County coroner&#x27;s office concluded that Levert&#x27;s death was caused by a fatal combination of prescription narcotics and over-the-counter drugs. The drugs in his bloodstream included the narcotic pain relievers Vicodin, Percocet, and Darvocet, the anxiety medication Xanax, and two over-the-counter antihistamines. The autopsy also revealed that Levert had pneumonia. The official cause of death was acute intoxication, and the death was ruled accidental. Following disclosure of Levert&#x27;s cause of death, a family spokesman stated that all the drugs found in Levert&#x27;s bloodstream were prescribed to the singer. Levert was taking the pain medication because of chronic pain from a lingering shoulder problem and surgery in 2005 to repair a severed Achilles tendon.

==Personal life==
Levert dated singer Miki Howard from 1985 to 1989. In 2003, Levert had a relationship with singer Kandi Burruss. They had no children together. Levert had three children: LeMicah, Camryn, and Carlysia.
Carlysia, an aspiring singer, appeared on the MTV series &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot;, with her father in 2005. His father is the third cousin of Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player Caris LeVert.

Shortly before his death, Levert completed work on what would be his final album, &quot;In My Songs&quot;. The album was released on February 13, 2007. In June 2007, a book Gerald was working to complete entitled, &quot;I Got Your Back: A Father and Son Keep it Real About Love, Fatherhood, Family, and Friendship&quot;, was released. The book was initially planned as a tie-in for a Levert album of the same name. &quot;I Got Your Back&quot; explores Gerald and Eddie&#x27;s father/son relationship, the necessity of male bonding, and the importance of repairing fractured families. Levert was also working on a reality show in which he was losing weight along with 12 of his female fans, who were training with him at his palatial home.

==Awards and nominations==
On December 7, 2006, it was announced that Levert, along with Chaka Khan, Yolanda Adams and Carl Thomas were nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocals for their collaboration on &quot;Everyday (Family Reunion)&quot;, a song from the soundtrack of Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Madea&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot;. He was nominated again for the Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for his single, &quot;In My Songs&quot;. At the 50th annual Grammy Awards, it was announced that Levert had won the award for &quot;In My Songs&quot;. Levert&#x27;s brother and former founding &quot;LeVert&quot; member Sean Levert accepted on his late brother&#x27;s behalf.
On August 17, 2013, in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, Gerald Levert was inducted into the 2013 class of the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame along with the O&#x27;Jays.

<doc id="998926" wikidata="Q7319567" url="?curid=998926" title="Reynardine">
<text>Reynardine is a traditional English ballad (Roud 397). In the versions most commonly sung and recorded today, Reynardine is a werefox who attracts beautiful women so that he can take them away to his castle. What fate meets them there is usually left ambiguous.

== The Mountains High ==
The original English ballads upon which Reynardine are based, most of which date to the Victorian era, are generally found under the title The Mountains High. In the original story, Ranordine (also given as Rinordine, Rinor Dine, Ryner Dyne, Rine-a-dine, Rynadine, Retterdyne, Randal Rhin or Randal Rine) is a bandit or outlaw who encounters a young woman in the wilderness and seduces or abducts her. The song ends with a warning to young women to beware of strange men.

&quot;The Mountains High&quot; appears not to be very old, since only one version was collected before 1800. A version appears in George Petrie&#x27;s 1855 collection of ballads; other variants appear in a number of broadside ballads from the nineteenth century. Washington Irving relates that the song had crossed the Atlantic and was being sung in Kentucky before 1832, and that it spread through North America in the nineteenth century as well.

A text of a circa 1814 broadside Ballads Catalogue: Harding B 25(1273) 
:A new Song, called the
:MOUTAINS [sic] HIGH.

:ONE evening in my rambles two miles below Pimroy,
:I met a farmer&#x27;s daughter all on the mountains high,
:Her beauty so enticed me, I could not pass her by,
:So with my gun I&#x27;ll guard her, all on the mountains high.→
:I said my pretty creature I&#x27;m glad to meet you here,
:On these lonesome mountains, your beauty shines so clear,
:She said kind sir, be civil, my company forsake,
:For it is my opinion I fear you are some rake.
:Said he I am no rake, I&#x27;m brought up in Venus&#x27; train,
:I&#x27;m seeking for concealment, all in the judge&#x27;s name,
:Oh! if my parents they did know your life they would destroy,
:For keeping of my company, all on the mountains high.
:I said my pretty creature don&#x27;t let your parents know,
:For if you do they&#x27;ll ruin me and prove my overthrow,
:This pretty little young thing she stood all in amaze,
:With eyes as bright as Amber upon me she did gaze.
:Her ruby lips and cherry cheeks, the lass of Firmadie,
:She fainted in my arms there, all on the mountains high,
:When I had kissed her once or twice, she came to herself again,
:And said kind Sir be civil and tell to me your name.
:Go down in yonder forest, my castle there you&#x27;ll find,
:Well wrote in ancient history, my name is Rynadine:
:Come all you pretty fair maids, a warning take by me,
:Be sure you quit night walking, and shun bad company,
:For if you don&#x27;t you are sure to rue until the day you die
:Beware of meeting Rynadine all on the mountains high.
:::::Wood, Printer, Liverpool.

== A. L. Lloyd&#x27;s contributions ==
According to folklorist Stephen Winick, although the name &quot;Reynardine&quot; is found in one 19th century version, the association with foxes, as well as Reynardine&#x27;s supernatural characteristics, first arise in connection with a fragment of the ballad (a single stanza) that was collected in 1904 by Herbert Hughes. The source&#x27;s recollection of the ballad was that Reynardine was an Irish &quot;faëry&quot; who could turn into a fox. This ability (which is not suggested in any extant version of &quot;The Mountains High&quot;) may have derived from the word &quot;Reynardine&quot;: &quot;renard&quot; is French for &quot;fox,&quot; deriving from the trickster figure Reynard.

Winick points out that Hughes and a friend named Joseph Campbell (not to be confused with the mythologist) wrote short poems incorporating this stanza and the fox interpretation, aspects of which A. L. Lloyd in turn adapted for his versions of &quot;Reynardine&quot; (see Winick 2004). Winick also shows that Lloyd&#x27;s versions incorporate several striking turns of phrase, including &quot;sly, bold Reynardine&quot; and &quot;his teeth did brightly shine&quot;, that are found neither in the original ballads, nor in Hughes&#x27; or Campbell&#x27;s versions.

Lloyd generally represented his versions of &quot;Reynardine&quot; as &quot;authentic&quot; folksongs (going so far as to claim to have collected the song from one &quot;Tom Cook, of Eastbridge, Suffolk&quot;), but this informant has never apparently been encountered by any other collector. Lloyd&#x27;s claims have led to the current state of confusion; few modern singers know that the &quot;werefox&quot; interpretation of the ballad is not traditional. Lloyd&#x27;s reworkings are certainly more interesting to the modern listener than the simple and moralistic original ballads, and have gained far greater interest from singers and songwriters; his versions of &quot;Reynardine&quot; have served as inspiration for many additional modern reworkings.

== Modern recordings ==

<text>Lenzburg is a town in the central region of the Swiss canton of Aargau and is the capital of the Lenzburg District. The town, founded in the Middle Ages, lies in the Seetal valley, about 3 kilometres south of the Aare river. Lenzburg and the neighbouring municipalities of Niederlenz and Staufen have grown together in an agglomeration.

==History==

A Neolithic grave field of the Cortaillod culture has been discovered on the &quot;Goffersberg&quot; (close to the Lenzburg Castle) dating from 4300 - 3500 BCE. A Roman theater was uncovered when a motorway was built in 1964. It was part of a small settlement with 500 inhabitants that existed for approximately 200 years. The settlement was abandoned in the 3rd century. In the 5th and 6th centuries, an Alamanni settlement existed. Lenzburg is first mentioned in 924 as &quot;de Lencis&quot;.

In 1036, Lenzburg Castle was used for the first time as seat for the Count of Lenzburg, then an important lord. The house however died out in 1173, and the castle was then transferred to emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In the following period, it was mainly used by the Kyburger house. The Habsburgs took over the castle in 1273. City rights were granted in 1306.
Lenzburg was conquered by Bern in 1415, along with the western part of current Aargau, though Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the region from 1444 to 1798. A major fire devastated the town in 1491, sparing only fifteen houses. The Reformation was carried out simultaneously with the rest of the region in 1528, and the economy started to transform slowly from an agrarian to a more industrial one in the 16th century. In the 18th century Lenzburg developed into a centre for cotton trade and processing. An Indienne textile factory was founded in 1732.

In 1798, the Helvetian Republic was proclaimed and the lords from Bern were ousted. The canton of Aargau was founded and Lenzburg became a district capital in 1803.

In 1830, a series of meetings were held in Lenzberg to discuss changing the cantonal constitution. When peaceful negotiation with the cantonal authorities in Aarau failed to produce results, Johann Heinrich Fischer from Merenschwand called for a rebel militia from the &quot;Freiämter&quot; to force the government to change, in what was known as the &quot;Freiämtersturm&quot;. On 6 December 1830, his rebel troops marched toward Lenzberg on their way to Aarau. At Lenzberg, about 100 government soldiers formed to resist the militia, and brought their guns in position. The &quot;Freiämter&quot; militia ran toward the militia with wild battle cries, and the government soldiers broke and ran without firing a shot. By 6pm the militia entered Aarau and the commander of government troops surrendered without any resistance.

Lenzburg transformed into the economic centre of the region in the second half of the 19th century. On 23 June 1874, Lenzburg was connected to the Aargauische Südbahn railway. On 6 September 1877 the Schweizerische Nationalbahn opened a line from Wettingen to Zofingen as part of a plan to connect Singen, Germany and Lake Geneva in competition with the established railway companies. The line went bankrupt in 1878 and was taken over by the Schweizerische Nordostbahn. The bankruptcy of the Nationalbahn brought Lenzburg to the brink of economic ruin, as the city itself was heavily involved in financing it. Paying back the city&#x27;s debt took half a century.

The castle changed hands several times in the 19th and 20th century. In 1860, it was bought by Frank Wedekind, a poet from Germany. In 1893, it was purchased by Americans and renovated. Finally, in 1956, it was bought by the canton and since been used to house a museum.

<text>Master of the Senate is a book that deals with the Senatorial career of Lyndon B. Johnson 
by the American writer Robert Caro.

In &quot;Master of the Senate&quot;, Caro chronicles Johnson&#x27;s rapid ascent in the United States Congress, particularly focusing on his tenure from 1949 to 1960 as Senate majority leader with the aim to show &quot;how legislative power works in America&quot;. This 1,167-page work delves into Johnson&#x27;s political acumen that Caro argues transformed the Senate from a stagnant institution into a dynamic legislative body by manipulating Senate rules, building a powerful coalition, and securing legislative victories, thereby laying the groundwork for his ascent to the presidency. 

==Outline==

The book starts with a 100 page history of the Senate, where he argues that in the mid 19th Century its deliberative nature delayed the Civil War by a couple of decades by being a place where the South (personified by John C. Calhoun), the North (Daniel Webster) and the rising West Clay could reach national compromise. After the Civil War Caro argues it lost its prominence firstly in domestic matters and later in Foreign Affairs through the combination of a lack of effective leadership, conservatism and the seniority system. The section has been criticized as &quot;a Mr. Smith Goes to Washington version of Senate history&quot;.

The second section talks about Johnson&#x27;s early, powerless, years when he at first &quot;lay low&quot;, with a biography and discussion of his mentor Richard Russell, where it is argued was both a superlative Senator but also a convinced racist, and an exploration of Johnson&#x27;s identification with the Southern Democrats who were very powerful within the Senate, although being too closely aligned to them could be harmful to Presidential ambitions. The book argues that to please financial backers in the Texas oil industry he orchestrated the sacking of their head regulator, Federal Power Commission Chairman Leland Olds by falsely accusing him of Communist sympathies, destroying his career. There is a chapter on his chairmanship of the Senate Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee which Caro argues was used to get favorable media coverage.

The third section charts his rapid rise to Senate Leader first as Democratic whip, and then Senate Minority Leader. The rise was through the support of the Russell and the Southern Caucus but informal power was maintained through his close connection with the House Speaker Sam Rayburn although Johnson tried to expand his circle outside the South to Senate liberals, particularly Hubert Humphrey. Unlike other powerful positions party leadership positions did not need seniority, but the positions had historically lacked power although Johnson did get some power through his ability to raise campaign funds in Texas and disburse them to other Senators. His use of the Democratic Policy Committee to control most of the Senate Committees is argued to be crucial to the way he maintained power later.

The fourth section documents Johnson&#x27;s rise to Majority Leader and gives examples of Johnson&#x27;s use of power as leader of the Senate. In the 1954 Senate elections the Democrats came very close to winning the Senate but needed the independent former Republican Wayne Morse, with whom Johnson had been feuding, although Johnson won him to the Democrat Caucus. It argues that Johnson drove a wedge in the Senate between the Eisenhower Administration and the more conservative and isolationist Republican members of the Senate, under Robert Taft by getting the Democratic caucus to support Eisenhower over measures such as the Bricker Amendment. It argues that Johnson reshaped the Senate into a far more effective legislature through retaining support of conservative fellow Southern Democrats while earning the cooperation of more liberal Democrats, particularly his future Vice President Hubert Humphrey. His reluctance to tackle McCarthyism, despite Johnson&#x27;s dislike for it and his power, is also explored.

In what is described as &quot;the most fully realized segment of the book&quot; the fifth section describes Johnson&#x27;s battle to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957, navigating the north-south split in the Democrats between the southern and northern factions, the first such legislation since 1875 during Reconstruction. The book argues that although the 1957 Act was effectively gutted by Johnson in order to avoid a successful Southern filibuster it foreshadowed his effective Civil Rights measures during his Presidency.

There is a short final section that charts the years between the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the start of Johnson&#x27;s 1960 campaign for President.

==Other Volumes==

Master of the Senate is the third volume of Robert Caro&#x27;s expansive biography series The Years of Lyndon Johnson which began in 1977. Four volumes have been published with a fifth volume expected, running to more than 3,000 pages in total, detailing Johnson&#x27;s early life, education, and political career. The series is published by Alfred A. Knopf.

==Reception==

Master of the Senate was released on April 23, 2002. According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;positive&quot; reviews based on nine critic reviews with four being &quot;rave&quot; and three being &quot;positive&quot; and two being &quot;mixed&quot;.

It won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, the 2002 National Book Award for Nonfiction, the 2002 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Biography, and the 2002 D.B. Hardeman Prize. However, the publication that year of the book was mentioned as a reason why one of the judges of the National Book Award, Michael Kinsley, read few of the nonfiction books in that year.

The book has also received praise from prominent politicians:

*Tom Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, once told the newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; after reading &quot;Master of the Senate&quot; that &quot;I think the thing you learn from reading that magnificent book is that every day, this body makes history.&quot;
*Walter Mondale, a former US vice president, described &quot;Master of the Senate&quot; as a &quot;superb work of history.&quot;
*Gordon Brown, a former British prime minister, when reviewing the book said of the series: &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderfully written set of books. The stories are quite breathtaking... These books challenge the view of history that politics is just about individual maneuvering. It&#x27;s about ideas and principled policy achievements. That&#x27;s what makes it one of the great political biographies.&quot;

Some reviewers claim that Caro&#x27;s treatment of the Senate is colored by his own Progressive politics. There is also a claim that Caro&#x27;s treatment of Johnson changed from a condemnation in the first book on the President, published in 1982 but mostly written before Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election and Master of the Senate written in the 1990s at a time when the left was &quot;shrunken&quot; and so Johnson looked far better in comparison.

<text>Megève (; ) is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Southeastern France with a population of more than 3,000 residents. The town is well known as a ski resort near Mont Blanc in the French Alps. Conceived in the 1920s as a French alternative to St. Moritz by the Rothschilds, it was the first purpose-built resort in the Alps. Originally it was a prime destination for the French aristocracy; it remains one of the most famous and affluent ski resorts in the world.

==History==
The town started its development as a ski resort in the 1910s, when the Rothschild family began spending their winter vacations there after becoming disenchanted with the Swiss resort St. Moritz. In 1921, Baroness Noémie de Rothschild (1888–1968) opened the Domaine du Mont d&#x27;Arbois, a luxury hotel which boosted the resort&#x27;s development. By the 1950s Megève was one of the most popular ski resorts in Europe and attracted many wealthy individuals and celebrities. Nowadays it is still visited largely by affluent people as is evidenced by the real estate prices.

==Development==
For the 2015–2016 winter season a six-seater chair opened replacing the two old Mont Joux chairs. Further additions include the latest branch of Folie Douce at the top of Mont Joux, introducing the chain&#x27;s trademark Austrian-style afternoon party scene, which opened in the 2014–2015 season. This will be the fifth in the Folie Douce chain, which started in Val d&#x27;Isère and then spread to Val Thorens, Méribel and Alpe d&#x27;Huez.

<doc id="998941" wikidata="Q885584" url="?curid=998941" title="BlueJ">
<text>BlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of Java Development Kit (JDK). 

BlueJ was developed to support the learning and teaching of object-oriented programming, and its design differs from other development environments as a result. The main screen graphically shows the class structure of an application under development (in a UML-like diagram), and objects can be interactively created and tested. This interaction facility, combined with a clean, simple user interface, allows easy experimentation with objects under development. Object-oriented concepts (classes, objects, communication through method calls) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.

== History ==

The development of BlueJ was started in 1999 by [|Michael Kolling]] and John Rosenberg at [monash university], as a successor to the Blue system. BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the Eiffel language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language.

In March 2009, the BlueJ project became free and open source software, and licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later with the Classpath exception.

BlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at King&#x27;s College London, England, where Kölling works.

=== Supported language ===

BlueJ supports programming in Java and in Stride. Java support has been provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017.

<text>Capital Liverpool is an Independent Local Radio station serving Liverpool, England. It is owned and operated by Global as part of the Capital network.

==History==

===Crash FM===
The station was launched by Janice Long and Bernie Connor as Liverpool&#x27;s answer to XFM, with the idea for an alternative music radio station being thought up by the pair at Keith’s Wine Bar on Lark Lane in 1994. Crash FM acquired a Restricted Service Licence (RSL) to broadcast for a month from 5 November 1995, with the studios at Mabel Fletcher College on Greenbank, seeing presenters such as Inspiral Carpets member Clint Boon take to the airwaves.

After a few more RSL broadcasts, the station relaunched on 107.6FM as a full time service, from studios at 27 Fleet Street, on 27 March 1998. Now known as 107 Crash FM, the station had backing from Bob Geldof, Primal Scream, Urban Splash, Kiss 102&#x27;s Mike Gray and Boy George.

In its application for a full-time licence, Crash FM said it would provide an alternative rock and dance station, aimed at 15- to 34-year-olds, with a target audience of over 80,000 tuning in for around eight hours per week in the first year. The original shareholders also included CLT, although they withdrew before launch with their 25% stake taken by Channel Radio.

===Juice 107.6===
Crash was bought out by Forever Broadcasting in late 1999 and relaunched as Juice 107.6 on 26 March 2000. By September of that year, the station&#x27;s RAJAR had increased significantly, after its format had been altered to include more mainstream pop and dance music.

In September 2003, Juice was sold to Absolute Radio (UK) Limited (AR-UK), a consortium made up of UTV Media and Eurocast, for £3.1m. AR-UK were, at the time, making moves in the FM radio licence world, notably in the West Midlands and Glasgow. The new owners aimed to develop more local programming, news and marketing but sold the station to UTV less than two years later.

On 12 January 2012, Juice switched from its Fleet Street studios to a new £1.1m facility at One Park West in Liverpool One, overlooking the Albert Dock.

===Capital Liverpool===
On 5 June 2015, Juice FM was sold again to Global for £10 million. The sale was given regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority exactly three months later, following a consultation.

On the same day as the sale was cleared, Global announced it would rebrand and relaunch Juice FM as part of the Capital network of contemporary hit radio stations.

The Juice FM brand was phased out at 4pm on 10 January 2016, with the station entering a transition period ahead of the full relaunch as Capital, which took place at 6am on 18 January 2016.

According to RAJAR, Capital Liverpool&#x27;s listening figures fell to 167,000 listeners per week a year after the rebrand. But as of RAJAR Q2 2019, after significant changes to the initial lineup, the numbers had recovered to 212,000 weekly listeners.

On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows would be replaced with networked programming from April 2019. The weekday drivetime show was retained alongside local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Three of Capital Liverpool&#x27;s presenters left the station.

===Digital radio===
Juice FM, was not present on the Bauer-operated central Liverpool DAB multiplex, but did subsequently procure a slot on MuxCo&#x27;s more recent multiplex serving Cheshire, the Wirral and northeast Wales. Following the relaunch as Capital Liverpool, the station took the place of Capital&#x27;s 97.1 FM Wirral service on the Bauer Liverpool multiplex.

Capital Liverpool remained on MuxCo&#x27;s multiplex until August 2016, when the slot was transferred to the 103.4 FM Wrexham/Chester version of Capital.

==Programming==
All programming is broadcast and produced from Global&#x27;s London headquarters.

Global&#x27;s Manchester newsroom broadcasts hourly localised news updates from 6am-6pm on weekdays and 8am-12pm at weekends.

<text>Capital Brighton was a local radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Capital radio network. It served the Brighton and Hove area broadcasting on 107.2 FM and across Sussex on DAB.

In April 2019, the station was merged with a sister Capital station in Hampshire to form Capital South.

==History==
===Surf 107===
The station was first launched as Surf 107 in March 1998, when the Radio Authority licensed Brighton and Hove Local Radio Ltd to broadcast on a commercial basis to the Brighton and Hove area.

Co-founders Daniel Nathan and Eugene Perera had previously run a series of trial broadcasts in the city beginning with Festival Radio 97.7 operating under a Home Office special events radio licence in May 1990 during the Brighton Festival and in subsequent years using a Radio Authority restricted service licence from 1991 to 1993. Writer and broadcaster Simon Fanshawe was the first chairman of the company with Eugene Perera as managing director. Various local companies held shares. Surf 107 began broadcasting on Friday 27 March 1998 and went on to win its first Sony Award a year later.

===Juice 107.2===
In December 2000, the radio station was sold to Forever Broadcasting plc which rebranded the station as Juice 107.2. In August 2003, Daniel Nathan led a group of local investors with the aim of returning the station to local ownership. 
In 2011, Juice 107.2 managing director Ryan Heal was recognised as an Outstanding Brightonian for his stewardship at the radio station and leadership within the community.

By this point, Juice 107.2 was required to pay for simulcast on the emerging DAB digital radio platform. The company&#x27;s directors did not consider the format suitable or financially sustainable and began lobbying parliament. In September 2012, in order to demonstrate an alternative approach to DAB, senior Ofcom engineer Rashid Mustapha together with Daniel Nathan initiated an experimental low cost DAB transmission that ran from the Juice 107.2 rack room and transmission site from September 2012 to January 2013 using open-source software. This work was commended in parliament by the Minister of State Ed Vaizey in November 2013.

An official trial was set in motion and on 31 July 2015, the Juice DIY DAB multiplex went live. In the same month, radio group UKRD acquired a 51% majority holding in the broadcaster, with Daniel Nathan remaining as chairman and local shareholders retaining the minority stake.

In August 2016, UKRD returned its holding in Juice to local investors.
As part of the sale, Laurence Elphick, who had departed as Juice managing director in 2014, returned to the post.

In late October 2016, Ofcom&#x27;s report concluded that the small scale trials had been a success. In March 2017, the Brighton multiplex became UK&#x27;s first to only broadcast DAB+. A month later, the work that began as an experiment in Brighton was officially recognised when the Private Members&#x27; Small-Scale DAB Bill received Royal Assent to pass into law as an Act of Parliament. paving the way for a new generation of low cost DAB transmission around the UK.

===Capital Brighton===
On 17 January 2018, Global Radio announced it had bought Juice 107.2 for an undisclosed sum. The sale was expected to be finalised the following month. The original owners continue to operate the trial DAB+ multiplex, carrying 25 radio stations in the city.

On 2 August 2018, Global announced it would rebrand and relaunch Juice 107.2 as part of the Capital FM Network of contemporary hit radio stations.

Juice 107.2 officially ceased broadcasting from its studios at 170 North Street at midnight on Tuesday 14 August 2018. The station relaunched as Capital Brighton at 6am on Monday 3 September 2018.

===Station merger===
On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station would be merged with Capital South Coast. As of Monday 8 April 2019, local output consists of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London while Capital&#x27;s Brighton studio – shared with Heart Sussex – would close.

The last local programming from Capital Brighton aired on Friday 5 April 2019. Local news, traffic and advertising for the Brighton area continues to air as opt-outs on Capital South.

<doc id="998958" wikidata="Q6229811" url="?curid=998958" title="John Doran (writer)">
<text>John Doran (11 March 1807 – 25 January 1878) was an English editor and miscellaneous writer of Irish parentage, wrote a number of works dealing with the lighter phases of manners, antiquities, and social history, often bearing punning titles, e.g., &quot;Table Traits with Something on Them&quot; (1854), and &quot;Knights and their Days&quot;. He edited Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the Reign of George III.&quot;. Among other posts, Doran was for a short time editor of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;.

==Life==
He was born in London on 11 March 1807. Both his parents were Irish: his father, John Doran, was a native of Drogheda, who after the Irish rebellion of 1798 went to England, and as a naval contractor was captured by the French. He was kept in France for three years, and acquired a knowledge of French, which he passed on to his son.

When very young John Doran was sent to Matheson&#x27;s Academy in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square. Before he was seventeen he was an orphan. His knowledge of French earned for him in the early part of 1823 an appointment as tutor to the eldest son of James Murray, 1st Baron Glenlyon. He travelled on the continent for five years with his pupil George Murray. From 1828 to 1837 he was tutor to Lord Rivers, and to the sons of Lord Harewood and of Lord Portman.

After giving up his last tutorship, Doran travelled on the continent for two or three years, and took a doctor&#x27;s degree in the faculty of philosophy at the University of Marburg in Prussia. Returning to England he became a professional writer, and settled in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, Hammersmith. In 1841 he began as literary editor of the &quot;Church and State Gazette&quot; until 1852.

Soon afterwards he became a regular contributor to the &quot;Athenæum&quot;. He became closely connected with William Hepworth Dixon, the editor, and during Dixon&#x27;s absences acted as his substitute. In August 1869, on the death of Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Doran for about a year succeeded Dixon as editor. On the retirement of William John Thoms, Doran was appointed to the editorship of &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;.

Doran died at Notting Hill on 25 January 1878, and was buried on 29 January at Kensal Green.

==Works==
At the age of seventeen Doran wrote a melodrama &quot;Justice, or the Venetian Jew&quot;, which was on 8 April 1824 produced at the Surrey Theatre. Before leaving England Doran had begun writing on the London &quot;Literary Chronicle&quot; (absorbed in the &quot;Athenæum&quot; in 1828), and during his time abroad he became a regular contributor. A collection of his Parisian sketches and Paris letters appeared in 1828 under the title of &quot;Sketches and Reminiscences&quot;.

Doran began in 1830 to supply the &quot;Bath Journal&quot; with lyrical translations from the French, German, Latin, and Italian, two of his favourite authors being Béranger and Catullus. In 1835 he published the &quot;History of Reading&quot;.

In 1852 Doran published the memoir of Marie Thérèse Charlotte, Madame Royale, under the title of &quot;Filia Dolorosa&quot;. The first 115 pages had been written by Isabella Frances Romer, who died, leaving the fragment. In 1852 he also edited a new edition of Charles Anthon&#x27;s text of the &quot;Anabasis&quot; of Xenophon. In 1853 he prefixed a life of Edward Young to a reissue of the &quot;Night Thoughts&quot;, rewritten in 1854 for Young&#x27;s complete works. 

At the same period Doran began a series of popular works. In 1854 he published &quot;Table Traits and Something on Them&quot; and &quot;Habits and Men&quot;, both rich in anecdotes. In 1855 he published in 2 vols. &quot;The Queens of the House of Hanover&quot;. In 1856 appeared &quot;Knights and their Days&quot;. In 1857 Doran published, in 2 vols. a historical compilation entitled &#x27;Monarchs retired from Business.&#x27; In 1858 he published his &quot;History of Court Fools&quot;, and edited the &quot;Bentley Ballads&quot;, which passed through several editions. In 1859 he produced &quot;New Pictures and Old Panels&quot;. Nearly at the same time he published for the first time from the original manuscripts, in 2 vols., &quot;The Last Journals of Horace Walpole&quot;.

In 1860 appeared Doran&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Princes of Wales&quot;, and in 1861 his &quot;Memoir of Queen Adelaide&quot;. In 1860 Doran published his most elaborate work, &quot;Their Majesties&#x27; Servants&quot;, a history of the English stage, of which a new edition was issued in 1887, revised by Robert W. Lowe. &quot;Saints and Sinners, or in the Church and about it&quot;, appeared in 1868. In the same year he edited Henry Tuckerman&#x27;s &quot;The Collector&quot;, a series of essays on books, newspapers, pictures, inns, authors, doctors, holidays, actors, and preachers. Immediately after the raising of the siege of Paris he brought out &quot;A Souvenir of the War of 1870–1&quot;.

In 1873 he published &quot;A Lady of the Last Century&quot;, on Elizabeth Montagu. Three years later he published, in 2 vols. &quot;Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1740–86&quot;, based on the letters of Sir Horace Mann to Horace Walpole. Also in 2 vols. was &quot;London in the Jacobite Times&quot;(1877). &quot;Memories of our Great Towns, with Anecdotic Gleanings concerning their Worthies and their Oddities&quot; (1878) was a humorous volume. His final publication was produced as a serial contribution to &quot;Temple Bar&quot;, and published posthumously in 1885 as &quot;In and about Drury Lane&quot;, a kind of appendix to &quot;Their Majesties&#x27; Servants&quot;.

==Family==
On 3 July 1834 he married at Reading Emma, the daughter of Captain Gilbert, R.N., and settled down for a time in Hay-a-Park Cottage, at Knaresborough. He left an only son, Alban Doran, F.R.C.S., and an only daughter, Florence, married to Andreas Holtz of Twyford Abbey, near Ealing.

<text>Francis Douce ( ; 175730 March 1834) was a British antiquary and museum curator.

==Biography==
Douce was born in London. His father was a clerk in Chancery. After completing his education he entered his father&#x27;s office, but soon quit it to devote himself to the study of antiquities. He became a prominent member of the Society of Antiquaries, and from 1799 to 1811 served as Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum, but was compelled to resign owing to a quarrel with one of the trustees.

Francis attended a school in Richmond, where he became proficient in Latin and made some progress with Greek, before suddenly relocating to a French academy. After his schooling, he entered the Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1779 and was admitted an attorney of the King&#x27;s Bench. In the same year, Francis was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and in 1781 was admitted to use the British Museum Library.

In 1807 he published his &quot;Illustrations of Shakespeare and Ancient Manners&quot; (2 vols. 8vo), which contained some curious information, along with a great deal of trifling criticism and mistaken interpretation. An unfavourable notice of the work in &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot; greatly irritated the author, and made him unwilling to venture any further publications. He contributed, however, a considerable number of papers to the &quot;Archaeologia&quot; and &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1833 he published a &quot;Dissertation on the various Designs of the Dance of Death&quot;, the substance of which had appeared forty years before.

In 1807 the British Museum recruited him to the Department of Manuscripts, where in the same year he succeeded Robert Nares as Keeper. His relationship with the museum was uneasy from the start, so that after only five years&#x27; service he resigned in 1811.

In 1823 he received a bequest of £50,000 from the estate of the sculptor Joseph Nollekens, which enabled him to buy the finest printed books and manuscripts that came on to the market.

He died on 30 March 1834.

In his will he left his printed books, illuminated manuscripts, coins &amp;c., to the Bodleian Library; his own manuscript works to the British Museum, with directions that the chest containing them should not be opened until 1 January 1900; and his paintings, carvings and miscellaneous antiquities to Sir Samuel Meyrick, who published an account of them, entitled &quot;The Doucean Museum&quot;.

==Reasons for resignation==
In 1811 Douce resigned from the British Museum citing a series of reasons that have become legendary in institutional circles. The letter is preserved in the Bodleian Library.
His list of complaints runs as follows: 
# The Nature of the constitution of the M[useum] altogether objectionable.
# The coldness, even danger, in the frequenting the great house in winter.
# The vastness of the business remaining to be done &amp; continually flowing in.
# The total impossibility of my individual efforts, limited, restrained &amp; controlled as they are, to do any real, or at least much, good.
# An apparent, &amp; I believe real, system of espionage throughout the place &amp; certainly a want of due respect towards and confidence in the officers.
# The total absence of all aid in my department.
# The apartments I reside in are dangerously cold in winter &amp; like an oven in summer. The whole damp, especially the lower room where my books are in great jeopardy &amp; which I never entered, even in summer time, without being sensibly affected with some kind of pain or unpleasant sensation.
# The general unwholesomeness of the air from sinks, drains, the ill-contrived &amp; filthy water closet; &amp; most of all the large &amp; excessively cold bed chamber with an opening to the back kitchen &amp; all its damp &amp; cellar like smells.
# The want of society with the members, their habits wholly different &amp; their manners far from fascinating &amp; sometimes repulsive.
# The want of power to do any good, &amp; the difficulty to make the motley &amp; often trifling committees sensible that they could do any.
# The general pride &amp; affected consequence of these committees.
# Their assumption of power, that I think not vested in them.
# The fiddle faddle requisition of incessant reports, the greatest part of which can inform them of nothing, or, when they do, of what they are generally incapable of understanding or fairly judging of.

== Collection ==
Douce collected a vast array of manuscripts and books, and formed an extensive library containing numerous manuscripts and printed books. Through his collection, Douce wished to illustrate the manners, customs, and beliefs of people throughout the ages and it is particularly strong in history, biography, antiquities, manners, customs, the fine arts, travel, archaeology, witchcraft, the ‘Dance of Death’, and in foreign books. Although his collection spans a number of different languages, it has particular strengths in English literature, especially Shakespeare, illuminated Books of Hours, and French romances. A catalogue of his manuscripts and printed books was published in 1840 by Henry Octavius Coxe, and later supplemented by entries in the Summary Catalogue.

Douce bequeathed over 19,000 volumes of printed books to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, including 479 incunabula (15 of which are items printed by Caxton); Bibles; Books of Common Prayer; Psalters; early-printed editions of medieval romances; editions of novels and tales, including 17th and 18th century French fiction; original and early editions of 17th and 18th century English drama; a collection of poems, songs, and ballads; almanacs and prognostications from the 17th and 18th centuries; sale catalogues; books in fine bindings; and a Chinese collection which although small, contains several rarities. In addition, the Bodleian also holds 420 of Douce&#x27;s manuscripts (two thirds of which are medieval or 16th century, including Books of Hours, French romances and early English literature, all notable for their illustrations), as well as Douce&#x27;s correspondence and a series of notebooks. The collection also contained 27,000 prints, 1,500 drawings, and a hoard of medals and coins which were relocated to the Ashmolean Museum, also in Oxford; only those prints belonging to, or closely connected with books as distinct from pure art, were retained in the Bodleian.

=== The Douce Room ===
When the Bodleian Library received this collection, a space on the library&#x27;s first floor at the south-east corner of the Schools Quadrangle was cleared and renamed &#x27;The Douce Room&#x27;. The room&#x27;s walls were lined with shelves roughly twelve-feet high and the room was divided into northern and southern sections by a ceiling-high row of shelves which created a smaller room at the south end. The room was finished with shelf ladders, six freestanding dwarf-cases, and two large oak tables. Douce&#x27;s manuscripts were held in the smaller room at the south end, while the printed books were shelved in the larger room at the northern section. In 1839, the library&#x27;s board of curators commissioned a retired London engraver, Thomas Dodd, to catalogue the prints and drawings. By 1840, however, Douce&#x27;s coins, tokens, and medals remained unsorted in the library&#x27;s coin room. It was not until 1871, when William S. Vaux of the British Museum was commissioned by the library, that the coins were catalogued, although he only managed to catalogue around half of the collection by 1881.

In 1882, Edward B. Nicholson overtook the collection: he held the unorthodox view that all material must be catalogued, and also decided to remove the shelves of The Douce Room, but in doing so forced the relocation of a segment of Douce&#x27;s books. The new overflow of books was managed by adding additional freestanding cases. Nicholson also demanded the creation of a separate catalogue of the library&#x27;s incunabula, conducted by E. Gordon Duff, which later led to the discovery of the Schoeffer-Fust &quot;Canon Missæ&quot; of 1457. Duff left the Bodleian in 1888, and his work was resumed by Robert Proctor in 1891 who completed the catalogue in 1893. The catalogue included over 4,800 items, almost 400 of which were part of the Douce Collection – the largest single component of incunabula in the library. In 1884, Nicholson set out to break up the Douce Collection and other individual cabinets into geographical classes and series, including Douce&#x27;s collection of coins, tokens and medals, although his coin-room project did not gain momentum until the 1890s. It was completed in 1902.

By 1926, there was a severe shelf- and study-space problem so Douce&#x27;s coins, tokens, and medals were transferred to the Ashmolean Museum. This led to further exchanges between the Bodleian and the Ashmolean Museum, where Douce&#x27;s prints and drawings began to be arranged and catalogued.

=== Digital Bodleian Project ===
Many of Douce&#x27;s books have been digitised on the Digital Bodleian website, including over 247 archives and manuscripts, 97 printed books, 23 bindings, 8 maps and 7 music sheets. The digitised collection also spans 15 languages, including Latin, Middle French, English, Dutch, Chinese, Persian, and Malay, and ranges in period from the 8th to the 20th century.

<text>Sir Francis Hastings Charles Doyle, 2nd Baronet (21 August 1810 – 8 June 1888) was a British poet.

==Biography==
Doyle was born near Tadcaster, Yorkshire, to a military family which produced several distinguished officers, including his father, Major-General Sir Francis Hastings Doyle, 1st Baronet, who was created a baronet in 1828. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1839.

He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a degree in classics in 1831.

Studying law, he was called to the Bar in 1837, but his interestes were chiefly literary. Among his friends was William Gladstone, at whose marriage he assisted as best man, but in later life their political opinions widely differed. Later he held various high fiscal appointments, becoming in 1869 Commissioner of Customs. In 1834 he published &quot;Miscellaneous Verses&quot;, followed by &quot;Two Destinies&quot; (1844), &quot;Oedipus, King of Thebes&quot; (1849), and &quot;Return of the Guards&quot; (1866).

He was elected in 1867 Professor of Poetry at Oxford. Doyle&#x27;s best work is his ballads, which include &quot;The Red Thread of Honour&quot;, &quot;The Private of the Buffs&quot;, and &quot;The Loss of the Birkenhead&quot;. In his longer poems his genuine poetical feeling was not equalled by his power of expression, and much of his poetry is commonplace.

In 1869 some of the lectures he delivered were published in book form. One was his appreciation of William Barnes, and the essay on Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; was translated into French. In 1886 he published his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, full of records of the interesting people he had known.

==Family==
In 1844, he married Sydney Williams-Wynn, daughter of the MP Charles Williams-Wynn.

His eldest son Francis Granville Doyle (1846–1882) died of typhoid fever.

Doyle&#x27;s daughter Mary married Charles Carmichael Lacaita, MP and botanist.

The baronetcy passed to a younger son Sir Everard Hastings Doyle, 3rd Baronet upon his death, and then later to his other son, Sir Arthur Havelock James Doyle, 4th Baronet.

<doc id="998981" wikidata="Q3378541" url="?curid=998981" title="Jack Lindsay">
<text>John &quot;Jack&quot; Lindsay, , FRSL (20 October 1900 – 8 March 1990) was an Australian-born writer, who from 1926 lived in the United Kingdom, initially in Essex. He was born in Melbourne, but spent his formative years in Brisbane. He was the eldest son of Norman Lindsay and brother of author Philip Lindsay.

==Early life==

Lindsay was born on 20 October 1900 in Melbourne, Colony of Victoria. He was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and the University of Queensland under J. L. Michie, from which he graduated with first class honours in Greek and Latin. On 27 October 1922 at the district registrar&#x27;s office, Waverton, he married Janet Beaton, granddaughter of W. B. Dalley. He started his literary career in 1923 as a poet with a book &quot;Fauns and Ladies&quot;, illustrated by his father. In the 1920s he contributed stories and poems to a popular weekly magazine, &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, as well as editing the literary magazines &quot;Vision&quot; (with his father Norman) and &quot;London Aphrodite&quot;.

Lindsay founded, with P. R. Stephensen and John Kirtley, the Fanfrolico Press for fine publishing, initially in North Sydney. He left Australia in 1926, never to return.

==In the UK==

Lindsay and P.R. Stephensen established two short-lived magazines, &quot;Vision&quot; and &quot;The London Aphrodite&quot;, which were published by the Fanfrolico Press in the 1920s. In the 1930s the Fanfrolico Press ceased as a business. Lindsay described that experience later in the autobiographical work &quot;Fanfrolico and After&quot; (1962). He moved to the left politically, writing for &quot;Left Review&quot; and joining the Communist Party of Great Britain at the end of the decade, becoming an activist. He started writing novels while living in Cornwall. Lindsay&#x27;s earliest novels were set in Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire; they included &quot;Cressida&#x27;s First Lover&quot; (1931), &quot;Rome For Sale&quot; and &quot;Caesar Is Dead&quot; (both 1934). Lindsay&#x27;s historical fiction also includes &quot;1649: A Novel of a Year&quot; (1938), a social realist novel that begins with the execution of Charles I of England and explores the first year of the Republic through the eyes of ordinary citizens. He wrote &quot;1649&quot; as an anti-fascist novel. He collaborated with Edgell Rickword amongst others.

During World War II, Lindsay served in the British Army initially in the Royal Signal Corps. From 1943, he worked for the War Office on theatrical scripts. That year, he began an affair with the actor and activist Ann Davies which was announced as a marriage although Lindsay was still married. Ann was popularly known as Ann Lindsay. Ann died in 1954.

After the war Lindsay lived in Castle Hedingham, becoming the subject of defamation and suppression because of his Communist standpoint. Being a prolific writer, he published 169 books including 38 novels and 25 volumes of translations (from Latin, Greek, Russian, and Polish), as well as art, literary, classical, historical and political studies, biographies and autobiographies written from a Marxist perspective.

Lindsay was a vegetarian all his adult life.

== Awards ==

Lindsay was awarded the Soviet Order of the Badge of Honour in 1967, an Honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Queensland in 1973. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1946), the Australian Academy of the Humanities (1982), and appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (1981).

<doc id="998985" wikidata="Q3153508" url="?curid=998985" title="Internment of Japanese Canadians">
<text>From 1942 to 1949, Canada forcibly relocated and incarcerated over 22,000 Japanese Canadians—comprising over 90% of the total Japanese Canadian population—from British Columbia in the name of &quot;national security&quot;. The majority were Canadian citizens by birth and were targeted based on their ancestry. This decision followed the events of the Japanese Empire&#x27;s war in the Pacific against the Western Allies, such as the invasion of Hong Kong, the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and the Fall of Singapore which led to the Canadian declaration of war on Japan during World War II. Similar to the actions taken against Japanese Americans in neighbouring United States, this forced relocation subjected many Japanese Canadians to government-enforced curfews and interrogations, job and property losses, and forced repatriation to Japan.

From shortly after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor until 1949, Japanese Canadians were stripped of their homes and businesses, then sent to internment camps and farms in British Columbia as well as in some other parts of Canada, mostly towards the interior. The internment in Canada included the theft, seizure, and sale of property belonging to this forcefully displaced population, which included fishing boats, motor vehicles, houses, farms, businesses, and personal belongings. Japanese Canadians were forced to use the proceeds of forced sales to pay for their basic needs during the internment.

In August 1944, Prime Minister Mackenzie King announced that Japanese Canadians were to be moved east out of the British Columbia Interior. The official policy stated that Japanese Canadians must move east of the Rocky Mountains or be deported to Japan following the end of the war. By 1947, many Japanese Canadians had been granted exemption to this enforced no-entry zone. Yet it was not until April 1, 1949, that Japanese Canadians were granted freedom of movement and could re-enter the &quot;protected zone&quot; along BC&#x27;s coast.

On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delivered an apology, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, one month after President Ronald Reagan made similar gestures in the United States following the internment of Japanese Americans. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the reinstatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan. Following Mulroney&#x27;s apology, the Japanese Canadian Redress Agreement was established in 1988, along with the Japanese Canadian Redress Foundation (JCRF; 1988–2002), to issue redress payments for internment victims, with the intent of funding education.

==Prewar history==

===Early settlement===

The tension between Canadians and Japanese immigrants to Canada existed long before the outbreak of World War II. Starting as early as 1858 with the influx of Asian immigrants during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, beliefs and fears about Asian immigrants began to affect the populace in British Columbia (BC).

Canadian sociologist Forrest La Violette reported in the 1940s that these early sentiments had often been &quot;organized around the fear of an assumed low standard of living [and] out of fear of Oriental cultural and racial differences.&quot; It was a common prejudiced belief within British Columbia that both Japanese and Chinese immigrants were stealing jobs away from white Canadians. Canadian academic Charles H. Young concluded that many Canadians argued based on this fear that &quot;Oriental labour lowers the standard of living of White groups.&quot; It was also argued that Asian immigrants were content with a lower standard of living. The argument was that many Chinese and Japanese immigrants in BC lived in unsanitary conditions and were not inclined to improve their living space, thereby proving their inferiority and their unwillingness to become truly Canadian. Violette refuted this claim by stating that, while Japanese and Chinese immigrants did often have poor living conditions, both of the groups were hindered in their attempt to assimilate due to the difficulty they had in finding steady work at equal wages.

In reference to Japanese Canadians specifically, human geographer Audrey Kobayashi argues that prior to the war, racism &quot;had defined their communities since the first immigrants arrived in the 1870s.&quot; Starting in 1877 with Manzo Nagano—a 19-year-old sailor who was the first Japanese person to officially immigrate to Canada, and entering the salmon-exporting business—the Japanese were quick to integrate themselves into Canadian industries. Some European-descended Canadians felt that, while the Chinese were content with being &quot;confined to a few industries&quot;, the Japanese were infiltrating all areas of industry and competing with white workers. This sense of unease among white Canadians was worsened by the growing rate of Japanese fishermen in the early 1900s.

Japanese immigrants were also accused of being resistant to assimilation into British Canadian society, because of Japanese-language schools, Buddhist temples, and low intermarriage rates, among other examples. It was asserted that the Japanese had their own manner of living, and that many who had become naturalized in Canada did so to obtain fishing licences rather than out of a desire to become Canadian. These arguments reinforced the idea that the Japanese remained strictly loyal to Japan.

===1907 riots===

The situation was exacerbated when, in 1907, the United States began prohibiting Japanese immigrants from accessing the mainland US through Hawaii, resulting in a massive influx (over 7,000 as compared to 2,042 in 1906) of Japanese immigrants into British Columbia. Largely as a result, on August 12 that year, a group of Vancouver labourers formed an anti-Asiatic league, known as the Asiatic Exclusion League, with its membership numbering &quot;over five hundred&quot;. On September 7, some 5,000 people marched on Vancouver City Hall in support of the League, where they had arranged a meeting with presentations from both local and American speakers. By the time of the meeting, it was estimated that at least 25,000 people had arrived at the City Hall and, following the speakers, the crowd broke out in rioting, marching into Chinatown and Japantown.

The rioters stormed through Chinatown first, breaking windows and smashing store fronts. Afterwards, the rioters turned to the Japanese-Canadian neighbourhood. Alerted by the previous rioting, Japanese Canadians in Little Tokyo were able to repel the mob without any serious injury or loss of life. After the riot, the League and other nativist groups used their influence to push the government into an arrangement similar to the United States&#x27; Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement, limiting the number of passports given to male Japanese immigrants to 400 per year. Women were not counted toward the quota, so &quot;picture brides&quot;, women who married by proxy and immigrated to Canada to join (and in many cases, meet for the first time) their new husbands, became common after 1908. The influx of female immigrants—and soon after, Canadian-born children—shifted the population from a temporary workforce to a permanent presence, and Japanese-Canadian family groups settled throughout British Columbia and southern Alberta.

===World War I (1914–18)===

Japan during World War I was an ally of the United Kingdom and opinions of Japanese Canadians improved slightly. Some Japanese Canadians enlisted in the Canadian Forces. On the home front, many businesses began hiring groups that had been underrepresented in the workforce (including women, Japanese immigrants, and Yugoslavian and Italian refugees who had fled to Canada during the war) to help fill the increasing demands of Britain and its allies overseas. Businesses that had previously been opposed to doing so were now more than happy to hire Japanese Canadians as there was &quot;more than enough work for all&quot;. However, by the end of the war, soldiers returning home to find their jobs filled by others, including Japanese immigrants, were outraged. While they had been fighting in Europe, the Japanese had established themselves securely in many business and were now, more than ever, perceived as a threat to white workers. &quot;&#x27;Patriotism&#x27; and &#x27;Exclusion&#x27; became the watchwords of the day.&quot;

=== Interwar years (1919–39) ===
In 1919, 3,267 Japanese immigrants held fishing licences and 50% of the total licences issued that year were issued to Japanese fishermen. These numbers were alarming to European-descended Canadian fishermen who felt threatened by the growing number of Japanese competitors.

While groups like the Asiatic Exclusion League and the White Canada Association viewed Japanese Canadians as cultural and economic threats, by the 1920s, other groups had begun to come forward to the defence of Japanese Canadians, such as the Japan Society. In contrast to rival groups&#x27; memberships consisting of mostly labourers, farmers, and fishermen, the Japan Society was primarily made up of wealthy white businessmen whose goal was to improve relations between the Japanese and Canadians both at home and abroad. The heads of the organization included a &quot;prominent banker of Vancouver&quot; and a &quot;manager of some of the largest lumbering companies in British Columbia&quot;. They saw Japanese Canadians as being important partners in helping to open Japanese markets to businesses in British Columbia.

Despite the work of organizations like the Japan Society, many groups still opposed Japanese immigration to Canada, especially in BC&#x27;s fishing industry during the 1920s and 1930s. Prior to the 1920s, many Japanese labourers were employed as pullers, a job that required them to help the net men row the boats out to fish. The job required no licence, so it was one of the few jobs for first-generation Japanese immigrants who were not Canadian citizens. In 1923, however, the government lifted a ban on the use of motorboats and required that pullers be licensed. This meant that first-generation immigrants, known as , were unable to get jobs in the fishing industry, which resulted in large–scale unemployment among these . Second-generation Japanese Canadians, known as , and who were born in Canada, began entering the fishing industry at a younger age to compensate for this, but even they were hindered as the increased use of motorboats resulted in less need for pullers and only a small number of fishing licences were issued to Japanese Canadians.

This situation escalated in May 1938, when the Governor General abolished the puller licence entirely despite Japanese-Canadian protests. This resulted in many younger Japanese Canadians being forced from the fishing industry, leaving Japanese-Canadian net men to fend for themselves. Later that year, in August, a change to the borders of fishing districts in the area resulted in the loss of licences for several Japanese-Canadian fishermen, who claimed they had not been informed of the change. While these events did result in reduced competition from Japanese Canadians in the fishing industry, it created further tensions elsewhere.

Japanese Canadians had already been able to establish a secure position in many businesses during World War I, but their numbers had remained relatively small as many had remained in the fishing industry. As Japanese Canadians began to be pushed out of the fishing industry, they increasingly began to work on farms and in small businesses. This outward move into farming and business was viewed as more evidence of the economic threat Japanese Canadians posed towards white Canadians, leading to increased racial tension.

In the years leading up to World War II, approximately 29,000 people of Japanese ancestry lived in British Columbia; 80% of these were Canadian nationals. At the time, they were denied the right to vote and barred by law from various professions. Racial tensions often stemmed from the belief of many Canadians that all Japanese immigrants, both first-generation and second-generation , remained loyal to Japan alone. In &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a professor at the University of British Columbia stated that the &quot;Japanese in B.C. are as loyal to [Japan] as Japanese anywhere in the world.&quot; Other Canadians felt that tensions, in British Columbia specifically, originated from the fact that the Japanese were clustered together almost entirely in and around Vancouver. As a result, as early as 1938, there was talk of encouraging Japanese Canadians to begin moving east of the Rocky Mountains.

The actions of Japan leading up to World War II were also seen as cause for concern. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, ignored the naval ratio set up by the Washington Naval Conference of 1922, refused to follow the Second London Naval Treaty in 1936, and allied with Germany with the Anti-Comintern Pact. Because many Canadians believed that resident Japanese immigrants would always remain loyal to their home country, the Japanese in British Columbia, even those born and raised in Canada, were often judged for these militant actions taken by their ancestral home.

==World War II==

When the Pacific War began, discrimination against Japanese Canadians increased. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese Canadians were all categorized, regardless of citizenship, as enemy aliens under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, yet the place of residency at the outbreak of the war significantly affected the removal of their personal rights. 

Starting on December 8, 1941, 1,200 Japanese-Canadian-owned fishing vessels were impounded as a &quot;defence measure&quot;. On January 14, 1942, the federal government issued an order calling for the removal of male Japanese nationals between 18 and 45 years of age from a designated protected area of inland from the British Columbia Coast. The federal government also enacted a ban against Japanese-Canadian fishing during the war, banned shortwave radios, and controlled the sale of gasoline and dynamite to Japanese Canadians. Japanese nationals removed from the coast after the January 14 order were sent to road camps around Jasper, Alberta.On February 19, 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which called for the removal of 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from the American coastline. Anne Sunahara, a historian of internment, argues that &quot;the American action sealed the fate of Japanese Canadians.&quot; On February 24, the Canadian government issued order in council PC 1486, which allowed for the removal of &quot;all persons of Japanese origin&quot;. This order in council granted the minister of justice the broad powers of removing people from any protected area in Canada, but was meant for Japanese Canadians on the Pacific coast in particular. On February 25, the federal government announced that Japanese Canadians were being moved for reasons of national security. In all, 27,000 people were detained without charge or trial, and their property confiscated. Others were deported to Japan.

=== Advocacy for Japanese Canadians ===
However, not all Canadians believed that Japanese Canadians posed a threat to national security, including select senior officials of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Royal Canadian Navy, and Department of Labour and Fisheries. Notable individuals on the side of the Japanese Canadians included Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, Assistant Under-Secretary at External Affairs during the internment of Japanese Canadians. Sunahara argues that Keenleyside was a sympathetic administrator who advocated strongly against the removal of Japanese Canadians from the BC coast. He unsuccessfully tried to remind other government officials of the distinction between Japanese foreign nationals and Canadian citizens in regards to personal and civil rights.

Frederick J. Mead, RCMP Assistant Commissioner, also used his position to advocate for Japanese Canadians and mitigate government actions. Mead was given the task of implementing several federal policies, including the removal of Japanese Canadians from the &quot;protected zone&quot; along the coast in 1942. Mead attempted to slow down the process, allowing individuals and families more time to prepare by following the exact letter of the law, which required a complicated set of permissions from busy government ministers, rather than the spirit of quick removal it intended.

However, it was not just government officials, but also private citizens, who were sympathetic to the Japanese-Canadian cause. Writing his first letter in January 1941, Captain V.C. Best, a resident of Salt Spring Island, advocated against mistreatment of Japanese Canadians for over two years. Best wrote to Keenleyside directly for much of that period, protesting anti-Japanese sentiment in the press, advocating for Japanese-Canadian enlistment in the armed forces, and, when the forced removal and internment of Japanese Canadians was underway, the conditions Japanese Canadians faced in internment camps.

===Mackenzie King===

William Lyon Mackenzie King served his final term as prime minister between 1935 and 1948, at which point he retired from Canadian politics. He had served two previous terms as prime minister, but this period was perhaps his most well-known. His policies during this period included unemployment insurance and tariff agreements with the UK and the United States.

Prime Minister King wrote in his diary daily for most of his life. These diary entries have provided historians with a sense of the thoughts and feelings King held during the war. Historian N.F. Dreisziger has written that, &quot;though he undoubtedly considered himself a man of humanitarian outlook, he was a product of his times and shared the values of his fellow Canadians. He was—beyond doubt—an anti-Semite, and shouldered, more than any of his Cabinet colleagues, the responsibility of keeping Jewish refugees out of the country on the eve of and during the war.&quot;

Prior to the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, Prime Minister King was not considered a racist. He seemed concerned for humanity and was against the use of the atomic bomb and even its creation. When King learned of the estimated date of the bomb dropping, he wrote in his diary: &quot;It makes one very sad at heart to think of the loss of life that it [the bomb] will occasion among innocent people as well as those that are guilty.&quot; On August 6, 1945, the day of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, King wrote in his diary: &quot;It is fortunate that the use of the bomb should have been upon the Japanese rather than upon the white races of Europe.

== Japanese Canadians serving in World Wars I and II ==
For many Japanese Canadians, World War I provided an opportunity to prove their loyalty to Canada and their allies through military service in the hopes of gaining previously denied citizenship rights. In the early years of the war, however, the supply of enlisting men surpassed demand, so recruiting officers could be selective in who they accepted. Still, large numbers of Japanese Canadians volunteered, as did members of other visible minorities like Black Canadians and First Nations, so the Canadian government proposed a compromise that, if enlisted, minorities could fight separately. The Japanese Canadian community was very energetic on this front. The Canadian Japanese Association of Vancouver offered to raise a battalion in 1915 and, upon receiving a polite reply, proceeded to enlist and train 277 volunteers at the expense of the Japanese Canadian community. This offer, however, was rejected by Prime Minister Robert Borden and his federal cabinet. Yet, by the summer of 1916, the death toll in the trenches had risen, creating a new demand for soldiers and an increased need for domestic labour, which meant that the recruitment of minorities was reconsidered. Under this new policy, Japanese Canadians were able to enlist individually by travelling elsewhere in Canada where their presence was deemed less of a threat. By the end of World War I, 185 Japanese Canadians served overseas in 11 different battalions.

During World War II, some of the interned Japanese Canadians were combat veterans of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, including several men who had been decorated for bravery on the Western Front. Despite the first iterations of veterans affairs associations established during World War II, fear and racism drove policy and trumped veterans&#x27; rights, meaning that virtually no Japanese-Canadian veterans were exempt from being removed from the BC coast.

Small numbers of military-age Japanese-Canadian men were permitted to serve in the Canadian Army in the Second World War as interpreters and in signal/intelligence units. By January 1945, several Japanese Canadian men were attached to British units in the Far East as interpreters and translators. In total, about 200 Canadian joined Canadian forces during World War II.

Throughout the war, Canadians of &quot;Oriental racial origin&quot; were not called upon to perform compulsory military service. Japanese Canadian men who had chosen to serve in the Canadian army during the war to prove their allegiance to Canada were discharged only to discover they were unable to return to the BC coast, or unable to have their rights reinstated.

== Forced removal, dispersal, and internment of Japanese Canadians ==
After Canada&#x27;s declaration of war on Japan on December 8, 1941, many called for the uprooting and internment of Japanese Canadians under the Defence of Canada Regulations. Since the arrival of Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian immigrants to British Columbia in the late 1800s, there had been calls for their exclusion. Vancouver Member of Parliament Ian Mackenzie saw the war as an opportunity to expel Japanese Canadians from British Columbia. He wrote to a constituent that &quot;their country should never have been Canada ... I do not believe the Japanese are an assimilable race.&quot;

Bordering the Pacific Ocean, British Columbia was believed to be easily susceptible to enemy attacks from Japan. Even though both the RCMP and the Department of National Defence lacked proof of any sabotage or espionage, there were fears that Japanese Canadians supported Japan in the war. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, for example, agreed with the view that all Japanese Canadians &quot;would be saboteurs and would help Japan when the moment came.&quot; In total, 22,000 Japanese Canadians (14,000 of whom were born in Canada) were interned starting in 1942.

Widespread internment was authorized on March 4, 1942, with order-in-council 1665 passed under the Defence of Canada Regulations of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, which gave the federal government the power to intern all &quot;persons of Japanese racial origin&quot;. A wide strip along the Pacific coast was deemed &quot;protected&quot;, and men of Japanese origin between the ages of 18 and 45 were removed. Thereafter, the entire Japanese Canadian population was uprooted from this designated zone. By November 1942, 22,000 people were displaced.

=== Sites of forced relocation ===
Japanese Canadians on the west coast were forcibly moved to road camps, sugar beet farms, or prisoner-of-war camps. Before being sent off, many of the men and their families were processed through Hastings Park in Vancouver; others were sent immediately for various destinations eastward. Many of the men at the park were separated from their families and sent into the British Columbia Interior or elsewhere in Canada, but most women and children stayed in the park until they were sent to Internment Camps in the interior or decided as a family to join the sugar beet farms in the Prairies.

Many of the Japanese nationals removed from the coast after January 14, 1942, were sent to road camps in the BC interior or sugar beet projects on the Prairies, such as in Taber, Alberta. Despite the 100-mile quarantine, a few Japanese-Canadian men remained in McGillivray Falls, which was just outside the protected zone. However, they were employed at a logging operation at Devine (near D&#x27;Arcy in the Gates Valley), which was in the protected zone but without road access to the coast. Japanese-Canadians interned in Lillooet Country found employment within farms, stores, and the railway.

The Liberal government also deported able-bodied Japanese-Canadian labourers to camps near fields and orchards, such as BC&#x27;s Okanagan Valley. The Japanese-Canadian labourers were used as a solution to a shortage of farm workers. This obliterated any Japanese competition in the fishing sector. During the 1940s, the Canadian government created policies to direct Chinese, Japanese, and First Nations into farming, and other sectors of the economy that &quot;other groups were abandoning for more lucrative employment elsewhere.&quot;

In early March 1942, all ethnic Japanese people were ordered out of the protected area, and a daytime-only curfew was imposed on them. Various camps in the Lillooet area and in Christina Lake were formally &quot;self-supporting projects&quot; (also called &quot;relocation centres&quot;) which housed selected middle- and upper-class families and others not deemed as much of a threat to public safety.

The forced removal of many Japanese-Canadian men to become labourers elsewhere in Canada created confusion and panic among families, causing some men to refuse orders to ship out to labour camps. On March 23, 1942, a group of Nisei refused to be shipped out and so were sent to prisoner-of-war camps in Ontario to be detained. The Nisei Mass Evacuation Group was formed to protest family break-ups and lobbied government organizations on the topic. However, their attempts were ignored and members of the group began going underground, preferring to be interned or sent to Ontario rather than join labour groups.

By July 1942, after strikes occurred within the labour camps themselves, the federal government made a policy to keep families together in their removal to internment camps in the BC interior or sugar beet farms across the prairies.

===Camp conditions===
Many Canadians were unaware of the living conditions in the internment camps. The Japanese Canadians who resided within the camp at Hastings Park were placed in stables and barnyards, where they lived without privacy in an unsanitary environment. Kimiko, a former internee, attested to the &quot;intense cold during the winter&quot; and her only source of heat was from a &quot;pot-bellied stove&quot; within the stable. General conditions were poor enough that the Red Cross transferred fundamental food shipments from civilians affected by the war to the internees.

Some internees spoke out against their conditions, often complaining to the British Columbia Security Commission directly whenever possible. In one incident, 15 men who had been separated from their families and put to work in Slocan Valley protested by refusing to work for four days straight. Despite attempts at negotiation, the men were eventually informed that they would be sent to the Immigration Building jail in Vancouver for their refusal to work. Their mistreatment caused several of the men to begin hoping that Japan would win the war and force Canada to compensate them.

Tashme, a camp on Highway 3 just east of Hope, was notorious for the camp&#x27;s harsh conditions and existed just outside the protected area. Other internment camps, including Slocan, were in the Kootenay Country in southeastern British Columbia. Leadership positions within the camps were only offered to , or Canadian-born citizens of Japanese origin, thereby excluding , the original immigrants from Japan.

The internment camps in the B.C. interior were often ghost towns with little infrastructure to support the influx of people. When Japanese Canadians began arriving in the summer and fall of 1942, any accommodations given were shared between multiple families and many had to live in tents while shacks were constructed in the summer of 1942. The shacks were small and built with damp, green wood. When winter came, the wood made everything damp and the lack of insulation meant that the inside of the shacks often froze during the night.

Very little was provided for the internees – green wood to build accommodation and a stove was all that most received. Men could make some money in construction work to support their families, but women had very few opportunities. Yet, finding work was almost essential since interned Japanese Canadians had to support themselves and buy food using the small salaries they had collected or through allowances from the government for the unemployed. The relief rates were so low that many families had to use their personal savings to live in the camps.

By the spring of 1943, however, some conditions began to change as Japanese Canadians in the camp organized themselves. Removal from the coast to ghost towns had been done based on location, so many communities moved together and were placed in same camp together. This preserved local communal ties and facilitated organizing and negotiating for better conditions in the camp.

=== Effects of camps on women and children ===
Japanese-Canadian women and children faced a specific set of challenges that greatly affected their way of life and broke down the social and cultural norms that had developed. Whole families were taken from their homes and separated from each other. Husbands and wives were almost always separated when sent to camps and, less commonly, some mothers were separated from their children as well. Japanese-Canadian families typically had a patriarchal structure, meaning the husband was the centre of the family. Since husbands were often separated from their families, wives were left to reconfigure the structure of the family and the long-established divisions of labour that were so common in the Japanese-Canadian household.

==== Post-war ====

Oftentimes after internment, families could not be reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community led to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home and as a result they rarely learned the language fluently. This fracturing of community also led to a lack of Japanese cultural foundation and many children lost a strong connection with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.

==Dispossession of Japanese Canadians==

The dispossession began in December 1941 with the seizure of fishing vessels owned by Japanese Canadians, and eventually led to the loss of homes, farms, businesses and smaller belongings such as family heirlooms.

Ian MacKenzie, the federal Minister of Pensions and National Health and British Columbia representative in Cabinet, was a political advocate for the dispossession of the property of Japanese Canadians. He campaigned to exclude Asians from the province of British Columbia, saying to a local newspaper in 1922 &quot;Economically we cannot combat with them; racially we cannot assimilate them...we must exclude them from our midst and prohibit them from owning land.&quot;

The &quot;Custodian of Enemy Property&quot;, an office of the federal government, was given administrative control of the property of Japanese Canadians, beginning in 1941 and continuing until 1952. As a bureaucracy under the authority of the Cabinet, the office of the Custodian took its directions from Order in Council 1665, as later amended by Order 2483, which allowed them to seize the property of Japanese Canadians. &quot;This is not a confiscation&quot; the government said, &quot;the Custodian will administer property in the interests of the [owners].&quot; The January 19, 1943, Order in Council 469 expanded the Custodian&#x27;s power to sell the property of Japanese Canadians. &quot;The Custodian has been vested with the power and responsibility of controlling and managing any property of the persons of Japanese race...the power to liquidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of such property&quot; without their consent.

These actions were carried out with significant public support. Citizens wrote to their representatives urging the removal of the Japanese Canadian community from British Columbia. Government officials reported property damage done to the homes of uprooted Japanese Canadians as members of the public engaged in &quot;ransacking&quot;, &quot;looting&quot; and &quot;wanton destruction&quot;. One official reported &quot;[a]lmost every building formerly owned by Japanese...has been entered at one time or another.&quot;&quot;

The dispossession and sale of property of Japanese Canadians was recognized as having long term implications for Japanese Canadians. Secretary of State Norman McClarty stated that the forced sales would be &quot;tantamount to saying that [Japanese Canadians] will never be returned to Vancouver...This may of course be desirable&quot;. Scholars note that Ian Mackenzie, the British Columbia representative in Cabinet, supported this &quot;permanent exclusion of Japanese Canadians from the entire &#x27;coast of British Columbia. Further, the Veteran&#x27;s Land Act distributed the dispossessed land of Japanese Canadians to returning WWII veterans, resulting in Japanese Canadians having nothing to return to when internment ended in 1949.
===Fishing boats===

Fishing vessels were among the first forms of property taken from Japanese Canadians. On December 8, 1941, Japanese Canadian fishers were required to surrender over 1,300 vessels to authorities. On the January 13, 1942, order in council PC 288 created the Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee. Chaired by Judge Sidney Smith, it was instructed to enable Japanese Canadian boat owners to &quot;freely negotiate for charters, leases, or sales&quot; of their vessels. Instead, the committee forced the sale of the fishing vessels, a decision that government lawyers later admitted exceeded the committee&#x27;s terms of reference and therefore was illegal.

Although officials claimed these measures were required due to war, fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half of all of the licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons&#x27; Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. Yet, the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a coastal attack on British Columbia.

Many boats belonging to Japanese Canadians were damaged, and over one hundred sank.

===State management of Japanese-Canadian property===
During the process of internment, federal officials told Japanese Canadians that their property would be held as a &quot;protective measure&quot; only and then returned to its owners. However, as early as April 1942, as Japanese Canadians were being actively interned, Ian Alistair Mackenzie began planning with Thomas Crerar and Gordan Murchison for the use of Japanese Canadian land for veteran settlement under the upcoming &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Land Act&quot; program. Property appraisal was undertaken by the Soldier Settlement Board which valued the farms at less than half their actual market values. Order 5523 passed in June 1942 threatened jail time and $1000 fine for individuals attempting to make private arrangements for their farms.

==== Storage, looting, and vandalism ====
In April 1942, the Office of the Custodian allowed Japanese Canadians to document the value of their property and possessions using registration forms prior to their displacement. However, insufficient warnings of displacement (sometimes as little 24 hours in advance) gave Japanese Canadians little chance to safely store their personal items. Some buried or hid belongings to protect them. Vacated Japanese Canadian communities were commonly vandalized and looted. An official from the town of Steveston reported that &quot;[a]lmost every building formerly owned by Japanese…has been entered at one time or another.&quot; In Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, officials described that &quot;it appears to be just the love of destruction which has made the thieves go through the buildings…&quot; The &quot;Marpole-Richmond Review&quot; reported that, despite attempts to remove valuable items from the Steveston Buddhist Temple, looting had resulted in &quot;numbers of cans in which have been deposited the white ashes of cremated former citizens of Steveston, have had their seals broken and their contents scattered over the floor…&quot;

As a result, officials sought to warehouse many of the belongings of Japanese Canadians. However, poor conditions in these facilities and ongoing looting led to the eventual loss of untold amounts of movable property. The Office of the Custodian also struggled with a significant administrative task: multiple people were appointed to oversee and pinpoint how much property each Japanese Canadian had, the condition it was in, the value it held, as well as to establish title, maintain insurance claims, pay miscellaneous expenses and translate and type all communication with Japanese Canadian property owners. Before the Office of the Custodian could come up with a system for organizing and maintaining the property, creditors, Japanese Canadians, other state officials, and members of the general public were all inquiring about property and pressuring the Custodian for answers.

==== Role of Glenn Willoughby McPherson ====
Glenn Willoughby McPherson was a young bureaucrat who established and directed the Vancouver Office of the Custodian during the time of the forced property sales. As was common in his time, he held racial bias and believed skin colour determined loyalty, he once said &quot;the only way the Yellow Race can obtain their place in the Sun is by winning the war.&quot; In addition to acting as director of the Office of Custodian in Vancouver, McPherson acted as an intelligence agent for the British government. McPherson&#x27;s role as a British agent was to send letters to update them on what was occurring in British Columbia. In these letters, he expressed prejudice against Japanese Canadians and his view that the RCMP was not doing enough to control them: &quot;police intelligence is greatly understaffed and...the Japanese have developed a high inferiority complex.&quot; Historians have speculated that he was the author of a 161-page document that was sent anonymously to the RCMP in June 1942. It identified suspects of Japanese heritage who were alleged to be a threat to the community. The document specified three different levels of danger:
* CLASS A: identified 5 suspects who were to be immediately arrested and questioned
* CLASS B: identified 173 suspects as dangerous
* CLASS C: identified 74 suspects who were deemed as safety issues for the community
The document also claimed that Japanese sex workers were spies for the Japanese government. This role and McPherson&#x27;s personal views were concealed from Japanese Canadians, while he orchestrated the sale of their property. Starting in September 1942, after most Japanese Canadians had been uprooted from coastal British Columbia, McPherson turned his attention to the forced sale of remaining Japanese Canadian-owned property.

==== Decision to sell ====
On January 11, 1943, a meeting of cabinet ministers (attended by Ian Alistair Mackenzie, Norman McLarty, Thomas Crerar, and Humphrey Mitchell) made the decision to permit the sale of Japanese Canadian owned property, which had been previously seized. It was argued that it would be in the Japanese Canadian owners&#x27; best interest to sell because the value of their properties would go down over time.

Glenn McPherson was asked to write the resulting order in council (469), which was passed into law on January 19, 1943. The order gave McPherson the right to begin organizing the sale of all Japanese Canadian owned property. This signified a shift away from prior efforts to preserve Japanese Canadians&#x27; belongings. July 1943 brought mass forced sale of real estate while well-attended weekly auctions in Vancouver were used from September 1943 to 1947 to sell chattels.

McPherson and the team working with the Custodian of Enemy Property started selling belongings deemed as &quot;perishable&quot;. Examples of these items would be grocery stock or other things that would deteriorate quickly. All of these items were sold without consent. Soon, the Custodian began claiming that items like fishing boats and automobiles were to be classified as perishable as well. Glenn McPherson rationalized this by saying that they were losing value over time and that the government could not afford to maintain them. Shortly thereafter, in the later months of 1942, McPherson began to argue that all Japanese Canadian owned property was perishable. Only property loosely defined by the Custodian of Enemy Property as having &quot;sentimental value and religious nature&quot; would be preserved throughout the auctions until 1949.

Unaware Japanese Canadians received receipts for a small fraction of the value that they saw in their property. The final auctions in 1947 left fragments of Japanese Canadian&#x27;s materials including only photograph albums, kotos, family shrines, and any items that would not sell in auction. These belongings could rarely be reunited with their owners.

=== Protest ===
Japanese Canadians lobbied the government to reconsider the forced sale of their property. They wrote letters to government officials or the Custodian of Enemy Property to protest. In British Columbia, officials identified 292 letters that they felt &quot;gave a fair representation&quot; of Japanese Canadians&#x27; concerns. A majority of the letters protested on the grounds of their property being sold for unreasonably low prices, without consideration of deeper property value or consent. In addition, the forced sale of property was seen as a violation of their rights as Canadian citizens.

Several risks were involved in writing to the Custodian. In a time when they were viewed as &#x27;enemy aliens&#x27;, many Japanese Canadians wrote to threaten legal action, or attempted to invoke their rights as citizens. Others, such as Tomio and Akira Yokoyama, immediately returned their cheques to the Custodian, and risked the loss of all sale revenue to convey their message.

A majority of the letters written by Japanese Canadians to the Custodian protesting or refusing the sale of their property did so on the grounds of the value of their lands. While Japanese Canadians&#x27; property and personal items were sold for less than their worth in market value, most owners contested that the Custodian had not taken into account the time, labour, and work owners invested in their land. Nor did the sales account for the memories, experiences and emotional value that many owners associated with their homes. In 1944, Toyo Takahashi wrote to the Custodian, explaining that when she and her husband moved into 42 Gorge Road, Victoria they spent over ten years of labour and hard work cultivating a garden of rare and exotic plants that won a horticultural award and was visited by the Queen in 1937. Many Japanese Canadians, including Takahashi, also emphasized the future value of their land, the labour put into building farms or businesses was an investment for many Japanese Canadians into not only their futures, but also for their children, and future generations. Japanese Canadians protested the sales forced upon them by the Custodian on the grounds that the sales failed to truly compensate owners for the holistic value of their land.An undeserved liquidation of my property...will not only jeopardize our present status but far worse our future welfare as well. This property is our home, the reward for long years of toil and anticipation, a source of recreation, a stake in the future of Victoria, and an insurance for our later welfare.

— Toyo TakahashiAlongside the underestimation of property value, many letters stressed a violation of democratic rights. Tatsuo Onotera wrote in his letter, &quot;I have been brought up as any one of your other citizens believing this is a fair and Democratic country, but the way we are being treated I have my doubts.&quot; Some writers compared the injustice they experienced to Nazis mistreatment of Jews in Europe. Tsurukichi Takemoto wrote, &quot;Isn&#x27;t the method you&#x27;re using like the Nazis? Do you think it is democratic?&quot; These and many other letters questioned the morality of the Canadian government. Half of the letters written spoke about consent or lack thereof, asserting they should have the right to refuse the sale of their property. Several writers sought to prove their citizenship as Canadians by explaining military service or stating that they were born on Canadian soil.

Many letters sent by Japanese Canadians to Government officials and the Vancouver Office of the Custodian protesting or rejecting the sale of their property were filed away by Frank Shears, who oversaw day-to-day operations at the Custodian&#x27;s Office. Letter writers received form letters informing them that the sale of their property was made based on the appraised and market value in accordance with federal law. In 1947, due to an upcoming royal commission, Frank Shears reviewed the letters for the legal representatives of the Crown and relayed that the basis of protest fell with two distinct spheres, tangible, or monetary and intangible, beyond money. Shears recommended that the Crown&#x27;s response &quot;should lie strictly with tangible and specific&quot;, ensuring that the deeper concerns expressed by the Japanese Canadians would not be addressed or considered.

=== &quot;Nakashima v. Canada&quot; ===
When the Canadian government issued order 1665 on March 4, 1942, Japanese Canadians were forced out of their homes and into internment camps. A few weeks after order 1665 was put into legal effect, the Canadian government released order 2483, which stated that the properties and belongings of interned Japanese Canadians were to be protected and held in their best interest by the Custodian. Japanese Canadians realized that the Canadian government was not acting in their best interest when their property began being sold without their consent.

Eikichi Nakashima, Tadao Wakabayashi, and Jitaro Tanaka were three Japanese Canadians who were facing the loss of their properties to the Canadian government after spending time in internment camps. They were selected by their community to represent the fight against the sales by suing the Canadian government and the Crown. Their case was slow-moving, but with the assistance of their lawyer, J. Arthur MacLennan, they were able after some delay to secure a court date on May 29, 1944. The opposing lawyer, Fredrick Percy Varcoe, Deputy Minister of Justice, argued in front of Judge Joseph Thorarinn Thorson that the sales followed from the &quot;emergency of war&quot;. Also he argued that &quot;the Custodian was not the Crown&quot;, so Japanese Canadians, on this logic, had named the wrong defendant. Further, Varcoe argued that &quot;the relevant orders created no trust&quot;, emphasizing that it was well within the rights of the Custodian to sell the property of Japanese Canadians without defying order 2483. Finally, Varcoe argued that the animosity of white British Columbians toward Japanese Canadians made the sale of only some properties unfeasible because he claimed that white buyers would refuse to purchase if Japanese Canadians were expected to return to live alongside them.

After three days of court, Thorson stated &quot;I do not think anyone expects me to give judgment now&quot;. Three years later, after the war had ended and the Canadian government had begun to exile nearly 4,000 Japanese Canadians, Thorson released his judgment. On August 29, 1947, it was announced that Nakashima, Wakabayashi, and Tanaka had lost. In his judgment, Thorson did not acknowledge any of MacLennan&#x27;s arguments and mentioned very little about the lives of the litigants. Without addressing the larger harms of the dispossession of Japanese Canadians, stated that &quot;the custodian could neither be characterized as the Crown nor its servant&quot;; therefore, the case ended before it began since the litigants had sued the wrong entity. In addition to losing their homes, Thorson also charged Nakashima, Wakabayashi, and Tanaka for the legal costs of the government.

===Bird Commission===

In 1946 and 1947, pressure began to build for the federal government to address the forced sale of Japanese-Canadian property. In 1947, representatives from the Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians and the Japanese Canadian Citizens for Democracy (JCCD) which had formed in 1943 asked the federal government&#x27;s Public Accounts Committee to launch a Royal Commission to look into the losses associated with the forced sales. In June 1947, the Public Accounts Committee recommended that a commission be struck to examine the claims of Japanese Canadians living in Canada for losses resulting from receiving less than the fair market value of their property.

A Royal Commission was set up later that year, headed by Justice Henry Bird, with terms of reference that placed the onus on the Japanese-Canadian claimant to prove that the Custodian of Enemy Property was negligent in the handling of their property. The terms of reference soon expanded to also include the sale of the property below market value, but no cases were accepted that dealt with issues outside the control of the Custodian of Enemy Property.

In late 1947, Bird began to hear individual claims, but by 1948 it became clear to the commission that the magnitude of claims and amount of property in dispute could take years to settle and become very expensive for claimants because of legal fees. Thus, in the spring of 1949, the Bird Commission adopted a category formula that set out certain reimbursement percentages for each category of claim, except for unusual circumstances.

The commission concluded in 1950; the report stated:
*The commission found that claims relating to fishing boats should receive 12.5% of the sale price as compensation and receive the Custodian of Enemy Property&#x27;s 13.5% commission. Out of the 950 fishing boats seized in 1941, only 75 claims were processed by the Bird Commission.
*Claims relating to fishing nets and gear should receive 25% of the sale price.
*Claims relating to cars and trucks should receive 25% of the sale price.
*Claims relating to the sale of personal belongings were deemed mostly worthless and claimants received the Custodian of Enemy Property&#x27;s commission plus 6.8% of the sale price.
*Very few claims relating to personal real estate received any form of compensation because the Commission concluded that most were sold for fair market value.
*Farmers whose property had been seized by the Soldier Settlement Board received $632,226.61 combined, despite that being only half of their total claim.

The top monetary award was $69,950 against a $268,675 claim by the Royston Lumber Company, and the smallest claim was $2.50 awarded to Ishina Makino for a claim against a car. After the report was released, the CCJC and National Japanese Canadian Citizens&#x27; Association wanted to push for further compensation, however, when claimants accepted their Bird Commission reimbursements, they had to sign a form agreeing that they would not press any further claims.

By 1950, the Bird Commission awarded $1.3 million in claims to 1,434 Japanese Canadians. However, it only accepted claims based on loss of property, refusing to compensate for wrongdoing in terms of civil rights, damages due to loss of earnings, disruption of education, or other factors. The issue of Japanese Canadian losses was not revisited in-depth until the Price Waterhouse study in 1986.

== Postwar deportation ==

===Resettlement and repatriation to Japan===
British Columbian politicians began pushing for the permanent removal of Japanese Canadians in 1944. By December, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had announced that Japanese Americans would soon be allowed to return to the West Coast, and pressure to publicize Canada&#x27;s plans for their interned Japanese Canadians was high.

Officials created a questionnaire to distinguish &quot;loyal&quot; from &quot;disloyal&quot; Japanese Canadians and gave internees the choice to move east of the Rockies immediately or be &quot;repatriated&quot; to Japan at the end of the war. Some 10,000 Japanese Canadians, unable to move on short notice or simply hesitant to remain in Canada after their wartime experiences, chose deportation. The rest opted to move east, many to the city of Toronto, where they could take part in agricultural work.

When news of Japan&#x27;s surrender in August 1945 reached the internment camps, thousands balked at the idea of resettling in the war-torn country and attempted to revoke their applications for repatriation. All such requests were denied, and deportation to Japan began in May 1946. While the government offered free passage to those who were willing to be deported to Japan, thousands of born in Canada were being sent to a country they had never known. Families were divided, and being deported to a country that had been destroyed by bombs and was now hunger-stricken due to the war.

By 1947, most Japanese Canadians not slated for deportation had moved from British Columbia to the Toronto area, where they often become farmhands or took on similar labour jobs as they had done before. Several Japanese Canadians who resettled in the east wrote letters back to those still in British Columbia about the harsh labour conditions in the fields of Ontario and the prejudiced attitudes they would encounter. White-collar jobs were not open to them, and most Japanese Canadians were reduced to &quot;wage-earners&quot;.

Public attitudes towards the internees had softened somewhat since the start of the war, and citizens formed the Cooperative Committee on Japanese Canadians to protest the forced deportation. The government relented in 1947 and allowed those still in the country to remain; however, by this time 3,964 Japanese Canadians had already been deported to Japan.

=== Reforms ===
Following public protest, the order-in-council that authorized the forced deportation was challenged on the basis that the forced deportation of Japanese Canadians was a crime against humanity and that a citizen could not be deported from his or her own country. The federal cabinet referred the constitutionality of the order-in-council to the Supreme Court of Canada for its opinion. In a five to two decision, the Court held that the law was valid. Three of the five found that the order was entirely valid. The other two found that the provision including both women and children as threats to national security was invalid. The matter was then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, at that time the court of last resort for Canada. The Judicial Committee upheld the decision of the Supreme Court. In 1947, due to various protests among politicians and academics, the federal cabinet revoked the legislation to repatriate the remaining Japanese Canadians to Japan. It was only in April 1949 that all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians.

Issues surrounding the internment of Japanese Canadians also led to changes to Canadian immigration policy, with the legislation gaining momentum after a statement made by the Prime Minister on May 1, 1947:

This reform to immigration policy was deemed necessary on two grounds: the inevitable post-war crisis of displaced persons from Europe, and the growing number of Canadians who wished to bring family to Canada following the war—the large number of war brides being the chief concern on this front. Mackenzie King believed that Canada was under no legal obligations to make such accommodations, only a moral obligation. During this time, the Canadian government also made provisions to begin the repeal of the discriminatory &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1923.

==Redress==

In 1947 the first &quot;nationwide organization of Japanese Canadians&quot;, the National Japanese Canadian Citizens Association (NJCCA) was founded in Toronto on Labour Day weekend. The NJCCA carried on the work begun by the Japanese Canadian Citizens for Democracy (JCCD). The NJCCA was renamed the National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC) in 1980. In 1977, during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese immigrant to Canada, discussions of redress began to have an effect. Meeting in basements and coffee houses, Japanese Canadian anger arose again, and the sense of shame was gradually replaced by one of indignation. This encouraged Japanese Canadians to fight for their rights and to gain compensation for what they had been through during the war.

In 1983, the NAJC mounted a major campaign for redress which demanded, among other things, a formal government apology, individual compensation, and the abolition of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.

To help their case, the NAJC hired Price Waterhouse to examine records to estimate the economic losses to Japanese Canadians resulting from property confiscations and loss of wages due to internment. Statisticians consulted the detailed records of Custodian of Enemy Property, and in their 1986 report, valued the total loss to Japanese Canadians at $443 million (in 1986 dollars).

On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delivered an apology, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, one month after President Ronald Reagan made similar gestures in the United States. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the reinstatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan. Following Mulroney&#x27;s apology, the Japanese Canadian Redress Agreement was established in 1988, along with the Japanese Canadian Redress Foundation (JCRF; 1988–2002), to issue redress payments for internment victims, with the intent of funding education. However, of the $12 million community fund, it was agreed upon by the JCRF board members that $8 million would go towards building homes and service centres for Issei senior citizens. Due to the fact that Issei had been stripped of their wealth, property, and livelihoods during internment, it was a main concern of the JCRF to provide aid to their community elders. Nothing was given for those that had been interned and died before compensation was paid out.

Following redress, there was increased education in the public education system about internment. By using this outlet, Canadians were able to confront the social injustice of Japanese Internment in a way that accepts those affected and aids in creating a community that values social reconstruction, equality, and fair treatment. Public education provides an outlet for wronged individuals to share their stories and begin to heal, which is a necessary process to repair their trust in a government that can care for and protect their individual and cultural rights. &quot;The first step to recognition of Japanese-Canadian redress as an issue for all Canadians was recognition that it was an issue for all Japanese Canadians, not in the interests of retribution for their &#x27;race&#x27;, nor only in the interests of justice, but in recognition of a need to assert principles of human rights so that racism and other forms of discrimination might be challenged.&quot; The question of whether Canada and Japanese Canadians can truly move on from the past has been explored in first-hand accounts and literature, such as Joy Kogawa&#x27;s &quot;Obasan&quot;.

The Nikkei Memorial Internment Centre in New Denver, British Columbia, is an interpretive centre that honours the history of interned Japanese Canadians, many of whom were confined nearby.

The internment of Japanese Canadians is the subject matter of the folk song &quot;Kiri&#x27;s Piano&quot; on the album &quot;My Skies&quot; by James Keelaghan.

Writer Joy Kogawa is the most famous and culturally prominent chronicler of the internment of Japanese Canadians, having written about the period in works including the novels &quot;Obasan&quot; and &quot;Itsuka&quot;, and the augmented reality application &quot;East of the Rockies&quot;.

<text>Lum v. Rice, 275 U.S. 78 (1927), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the exclusion on account of race of a child of Chinese ancestry from a public school did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision effectively approved the exclusion of &quot;any&quot; minority children from schools reserved for whites.

The case was brought by the Lum family of Rosedale, Mississippi, Chinese immigrants with two American-born children who had attended local public schools for white children without incident until, in the wake of an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment nationwide after passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, they were told by administrators that their children could only attend the district&#x27;s school for black children. Adrienne Berard points out in Water Tossing Boulders that their reason for choosing to avoid black schools was motivated by racism. In fact, Katherine Lum later told a reporter, “I did not want my children to attend the ‘colored’ schools [because] the community would have classified us as Negroes.” They filed suit in local court to force the district to allow their daughters to continue attending the white school.

Earl Brewer, a former governor of the state, represented the Lums, arguing that forcing the girls to attend the inferior school violated their Fourteenth Amendment, and that since they were not Black they should be allowed to attend the schools for whites. He was able to win the writ of mandamus they sought, but then the school district appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which heard the case &quot;en banc&quot; and unanimously reversed the lower court, holding that Mississippi&#x27;s constitution and laws clearly distinguished Asians (&quot;Mongolians&quot;, it called them) from whites, so the Lums could not attend white schools.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted Brewer&#x27;s &quot;certiorari&quot; petition to review the case. The case was never argued; instead just decided on its briefs, and the Lums were so poor it led Justice Louis Brandeis to ask around if some other lawyer could be found on short notice to argue the case. Chief Justice William Howard Taft&#x27;s unanimous opinion ended with a pronouncement that all racial segregation in schools was constitutional; while it was overturned by &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; a quarter-century later, it gave greater legal foundation to educational segregation in the short term and set back efforts to end it.

==Background==

===Legal discrimination against Blacks and Chinese in the late 19th century===

In the late 19th century, following the Civil War, the United States began to deal with the place in society of two racial minorities: Blacks, especially those newly freed from slavery, and Chinese, who had begun emigrating to the West Coast in large numbers first to try their luck in the California Gold Rush and later to work on railroad construction and mining. Both came to be seen as a threat to an existing social hierarchy dominated by whites: Blacks for their newly free status, and the Chinese as cheap labor. States that had formerly allowed slavery dealt with the former through Jim Crow laws mandating racial segregation in public accommodations such as transport and public schools, Black Codes that made specific acts crimes when committed by Blacks, and vaguely worded anti-vagrancy laws that allowed many Black men to be taken into custody for purposes of convict leasing.

Legal discrimination against Chinese immigrants began in California during the 1870s. The Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed unrestricted entry and a path to citizenship for any immigrants of African descent, denied it to anyone of Chinese descent. In 1882 Congress passed the first Chinese Exclusion Act, limiting further Chinese immigration to narrowly defined categories of people, including a bar on family members of Chinese citizens already in the U.S., the only time the law has mandated immigrants be denied admission explicitly on the grounds of racial identity or national origin.

In the 1885 case &quot;Tape v. Hurley&quot;, California&#x27;s Supreme Court held that a Chinese student&#x27;s exclusion from a San Francisco public school was unconstitutional; the state responded by allowing the establishment of segregated schools.

Two years earlier, in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, the Court had held that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, both passed in the years after the war, only barred racial discrimination by the government, not private parties. In 1896&#x27;s &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which went further and upheld the constitutionality of laws that mandated segregation in private facilities open to the public such as rail transport, Justice John Marshall Harlan, the sole dissenter as he had been in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, noted the dissonance between the legal treatment of Blacks and Chinese:

Harlan&#x27;s belief that the Chinese were culturally incapable of assimilating into American society and thus properly barred from naturalizing was personal; in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; two years later, where the Court held that American-born Chinese were citizens, he joined Chief Justice Melville Fuller in dissenting in part on those grounds.

===The Lum family===

Jeu Gong Lum, a native of southern China, illegally immigrated to the U.S. from Canada in 1904 and settled in the lower Mississippi Delta, where immigration laws were less enforced as employers sought to replace Black workers who had left for the North. There he married Katherine Wong, a Chinese American woman who had been adopted as an orphan in China and raised mostly in the U.S. by a Chinese father who grew wealthy operating a general store. Lum, too, opened a general store in the small Bolivar County town of Benoit that primarily served the area&#x27;s Black population, barred from many business establishments by strict racial segregation laws. Operating a store made Lum a merchant and thus exempt from the Exclusion Act. Black patrons preferred shopping at Chinese-owned stores since the Chinese were less insistent on being addressed with honorifics.

The couple had two daughters, Berda and Martha, and later a son, Hamilton. Both Gong Jeu and Katherine especially sought to make sure their children lived a better life than they had. While Berda resisted her parents&#x27; efforts to educate her, desiring to leave the Delta region when she grew up, Martha consistently earned good grades in the local school.

==Underlying dispute==

In 1923, the Lums bought a house in Rosedale and moved there. The girls attended Rosedale Consolidated High School of the Rosedale Consolidated School District for two semesters. The following September, that ended when the school district, in response to the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which effectively ended all immigration from Asia, told the Lum girls they could no longer attend its schools for whites because they were not considered white.

There was no school in the district maintained for Chinese students, and the Lum daughters were required to attend school. That left the district&#x27;s school for colored children as the only public school available. It was underfunded and poorly equipped; the Lums did not want their daughters educated there. They retained local lawyer Earl L. Brewer, a former governor who had just overwhelmingly lost an election to the U.S. Senate, to represent them in legal action against the district. The Lums and their daughters were the plaintiffs; all the members of the school district&#x27;s board of trustees, and other state education officials, were named as defendants, with the head of the board of trustees, Greek Rice, as the lead. Among the state officials was the state superintendent of education, Willard Faroe Bond, whom Brewer believed to have betrayed him politically while he was governor; Brewer thus drew some satisfaction from the knowledge that Bond would be personally served with the legal papers.

A lower court granted the plaintiff&#x27;s request of a writ of mandamus to force the members of the board of trustees to admit the Lums. Their case was not that racial discrimination as such was illegal but that his daughter, had incorrectly been classified as &quot;colored&quot; by the authorities.

===Mississippi Supreme Court===

The trustees appealed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which decided to hear the case &quot;en banc&quot;, with all six justices participating. Assistant attorney general Elmer Clinton Sharp argued the case for the school district, reiterating the history of segregation in the state and saying that Asians and Native Americans were not considered white. Brewer argued in response that while the state constitution had indeed not put whites and Asians on equal footing, it had also distinguished Asians and Blacks, and therefore the Fourteenth Amendment required that the Lum children be schooled with whites.

The court reversed the lower court&#x27;s decision and allowed the board of trustees to exclude Martha Lum from the school for white children. Justice George Ethridge, a former teacher to whom his colleagues generally deferred in matters related to education, wrote for a unanimous court that considered the case as a question of whether the Lum children were within the statutory definition of white. While some other states&#x27; courts and statutes had extended the definition of &quot;white&quot; to include members of other races who were not Black, Mississippi&#x27;s constitution and statutes were clearer in defining white people as those not &quot;colored&quot;. &quot;[W]e think,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the constitutional convention used the word &#x27;colored&#x27; in the broad sense rather than the restricted sense; its purpose being to provide schools for the white or Caucasian race, to which schools no other race could be admitted, carrying out the broad dominant purpose of preserving the purity and integrity of the white race and its social policy.&quot;

Ethridge found the most relevant precedent to be &quot;Moreau v. Grandich&quot;, a 1917 case where, in an opinion he had also authored, a unanimous court upheld the dismissal of several children of a white couple from the Bay St. Louis schools after it was learned that they had a Black great-grandmother. While that case had not gone beyond the instant issue in deciding that those whose racial heritage was colored above a certain threshold were themselves legally colored, Ethridge wrote, &quot;a careful reading of the opinion ... shows that the court did not intend to restrict the term &#x27;colored&#x27; to persons having negro blood in their veins or who were descendants of negroes or of the negro race.&quot;

The state had also, since 1892, prohibited marriages between whites and Asians, for whom it used the term &quot;Mongolians&quot;, the latter being defined as anyone with more than one-eighth Asian ancestry. Asians and coloreds, also barred from marrying whites, were free to marry each other, Ethridge noted. He added that a pair of U.S. Supreme Court decisions had both held that Asians were not white or Caucasian in the historical sense of how that word had been understood in the United States.

Lum&#x27;s right to an education was not affected by the decision, Ethridge concluded. She could attend the colored school, but did not have to, as she could also be educated privately, as long as she was educated. Lum and Brewer petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for &quot;certiorari&quot;.

==U.S. Supreme Court==

===Before the Court===

After the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1927, Brewer was preoccupied with representing the relatives of a Black man in Bolivar County who had been murdered immediately following his acquittal on murder charges in the death of a local white farmer&#x27;s son, as they sought to have the killers brought to justice. Brewer handed the Lum case to a younger associate, James Flowers, who had prior to his employment with Brewer worked primarily as corporate counsel for several railroads in Mississippi. Flowers was aware that he was ignorant in the areas of law related to the case, especially the Fourteenth Amendment.

Flowers&#x27; brief for the Supreme Court justices was inconsistent, alternating between defending segregation but attacking it inasmuch as he argued the Constitution protected Lum from being forced to attend a colored school, yet ending with a suggestion that segregated schools were inherently unequal. Justice Louis Brandeis, who believed the Fourteenth Amendment allowed too much federal interference with state authority yet was open to arguments that discrimination against members of minority groups violated their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, to the point that he had written several majority opinions to that effect (most recently &quot;Ng Fung Ho v. White&quot;, another case involving Chinese petitioners) was deeply disturbed by the brief; he asked a friend, Felix Frankfurter (himself later appointed to the Court), if it might be possible to find more competent counsel for the Lums.

The Lums themselves, realizing that the case had implications for all Chinese Americans, had similar concerns, and had arranged for a longtime friend of theirs, not a lawyer, to travel to Washington and be present at oral argument. That would be unnecessary. Within a week of filing the brief, the Court informed Flowers by telegram that it had scheduled the case for argument within the next week.

The short time available to travel to Washington, and the possibility that the case would be forfeited to the state if no one argued for the Lums, was the least of Flowers&#x27; concerns. He had never argued a case before any court, considering himself a poor public speaker. First he sought a continuance but learned that was unlikely, so then he and Brewer asked if the case could be decided purely on the basis of the briefs. The Court allowed that, and there would be no oral argument of &quot;Lum v. Rice&quot; before it.

===Opinion of the Court===

Late in November 1927 the Court announced its decision. In a nine-page unanimous opinion, with no footnotes, written by Chief Justice and former U.S. President William Howard Taft, it affirmed the Mississippi Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling and thus the position of the board of trustees. Taft held that the petitioner had not shown that there were no segregated schools accessible for the education of Martha Lum in Mississippi:
Taft further stated that given the accessibility of segregated schools, the question then was whether a person of Chinese ancestry, born in and a citizen of the United States, was denied equal protection of the law by being given the opportunity to attend a school that received &quot;only children of the brown, yellow or black races.&quot; In reference to &quot;Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education&quot;, Taft concluded that the &quot;right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear.&quot; Additionally, Taft pointed to a number of federal and state court decisions, most prominently &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, all of which had upheld segregation in the public sphere and particularly in the realm of public education. Accordingly, Taft concluded:
==Aftermath==

The Lums had pre-emptively moved across the river to Arkansas, which did not restrict Chinese attendance at its schools as strictly, in case the decision went down against them. When it did, they settled in Elaine, where they opened another grocery and Katherine was able to find a high school that would accept her daughters. It was not as prosperous a market as the one in Rosedale, and in later years the family left the Delta region entirely.

Other Chinese residents in Mississippi likewise began leaving the Delta, some even returning to China; save for those who found a few school districts still willing to accept their children in their white schools. Other Chinese families established private schools; in the late 1930s the state of Mississippi formally established some schools for Chinese students. They were never well-attended, and the last one closed in 1947.

Earl Brewer continued to pursue civil rights cases in the courts. In 1936 he successfully argued &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot; before the Supreme Court, which held that confessions obtained through beatings and torture were inadmissible as evidence, reversing the convictions of several of his clients. Brewer died in 1942, before he could live to see schools desegregated, but that had happened by the time Jeu Gong died in 1965 and Katherine in 1988.

===Press reaction===

Newspapers around the country carried the Associated Press account of the decision. Some responded with editorials. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; put its response, praising the Court and advocating for further segregation, on the front page:
The &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, a prominent Black newspaper, also ran a front-page editorial, condemning the decision as ignoring the &quot;separate but equal&quot; provisions supposedly governing segregation in light of the conditions found in many schools for Black children only:
==Legacy==
&quot;Lum&quot; continued to be cited in briefs supporting racial segregation, and court decisions upholding it, until it was effectively overruled 27 years later by the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which outlawed segregation in public schools. An important part of the decision still stands—the power of the state to make racial distinctions in its school system, and to determine the race of its students. It has not been overturned because it was not an issue in &quot;Brown&quot;.

It is remembered today for increasing the scope of permissible segregation. Historian and educator James Loewen called &quot;Lum&quot; &quot;the most racist Supreme Court decision in the twentieth century&quot;. Legal scholar Jamal Greene has called it an &quot;ugly and unfortunate&quot; decision. &quot;The Court&#x27;s ruling had established a precedent more powerful than the Lum family could have imagined&quot;, observed Adrienne Berard, in &quot;Water Tossing Boulders&quot;, a history of the case. &quot;By fighting, they had only made the enemy stronger.&quot;

<doc id="998990" wikidata="Q1716735" url="?curid=998990" title="Women on Waves">
<text>Women on Waves (WoW) is a Dutch nongovernmental organization (NGO) created in 1999 by Dutch physician Rebecca Gomperts, in order to bring reproductive health services, particularly non-surgical abortion services and education, to women in countries with restrictive abortion laws. Other services offered by WoW include contraception, individual reproductive counseling, workshops, and education about unwanted pregnancy. Workshops are conducted for lawyers, doctors, artists, writers, public health care activists, as well as for women and men to learn about contraceptive practices and non-surgical, self-induced abortion using RU-486 (medication abortion). Services are provided on a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 20 km (12 miles), to international waters, where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands. Once in international waters, the ship&#x27;s medical personnel provide a range of reproductive health services that includes medical abortion.

According to Gomperts, the first time the ship sailed out, it was a Dutch ship leaving Dutch waters. This meant they could take abortion pills with them to give out in international waters.

The A-Portable was designed by the Dutch studio Atelier van Lieshout and functions as both medical clinic and art installation.

Women on Waves volunteers and personnel have been targeted by governmental authorities, religious organizations, and local groups who are opposed to abortion and/or contraception. The NGO is credited for reviving debates about abortion in the countries where Women on Waves visits.

Today, access to abortion is a major focus of certain Dutch organizations and government initiatives. In the Netherlands, abortion is legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy and covered by the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act or health insurers.

Women on waves represents part of the global move for reproductive rights. The ship has been used to test and challenge the limited reproductive rights in countries like Ireland and attempt to create more access to abortion.

More than 9 out of 10 abortions worldwide occur in developing nations like the ones Gomperts and Women on Waves visit. Unsafe abortions in regions where it is outlawed or restricted are a leading cause of maternal death.

 Gomperts has faced considerable opposition to Women on Waves. The 2014 documentary &quot;Vessel&quot; shows anti-abortion protesters in Poland calling her a Nazi in a chant, and in Spain trying to tow the Women on Waves vessel back out to sea.

==Rebecca Gomperts==

Rebecca Gomperts is a physician in general practice, artist and women&#x27;s rights activist. Born in 1966, Gomperts grew up in the port town of Vlissingen, the Netherlands. She moved to Amsterdam in the 1980s where she studied art and medicine simultaneously. Drawing on her experiences as a resident physician on the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Rainbow Warrior II&quot;, which was captained by Bart J. Terwiel, Gomperts created WoW in order to address the health issues created by illegal abortion. While visiting Latin America on board the Rainbow Warrior II, the organization was inspired by a desire to further facilitate social change and women&#x27;s health. In some developing countries, as many as 800 illegal, unsafe abortions are performed daily, in contrast to some developed nations, such as the Netherlands, where residents have access to safe, legal, medical abortions and contraception. In collaboration with Atelier van Lieshout, she designed a portable gynaecology unit called &quot;A-portable&quot; that can be installed on chartered ships. The stated goals of the organization are to raise awareness and stimulate discussion about laws restricting abortion, as well as to provide safe, non-surgical abortions for women who live in countries where abortion is illegal.

== The A-Portable ==
The mobile gynecological clinic was designed and named by Dutch artist and sculptor Atelier van Lieshout. Known as the A-Portable, the clinic is in a retrofitted shipping container. It is painted a light blue color with the Women on Waves logo painted on the sides. To travel, the shipping container is strapped onto ships registered in the Netherlands, and rented by Women on Waves, which is a nongovernmental organization (NGO). Lambert-Beatty describes the logo, which was designed by Kees Ryter in 2001: [the clinic&#x27;s] &quot;side is emblazoned with a purple spot on which, in turn, floats an orange shape outlined in pink: a squared cross, one quickly realizes, of the kind that symbolizes humanitarian and medical aid.&quot; p. 309

The clinic is a fully functional gynecological clinic offering contraceptive counseling, sonograms, and medical and surgery abortions. It is generally staffed with two physicians and a nurse. Trained volunteers also staff the ship to provide education and counseling. The ship&#x27;s crew is nearly all female. In ports in countries that allow it, the ship&#x27;s staff provide workshops on legal and medical issues. During visits to countries with restrictive laws, the ship travels into international waters, usually about 12 miles from land, in order to provide services.

The A-Portable functions as a medical clinic, but is also considered to be a work of art. The original funds to create the A-Portable were awarded by the Mondriaan Foundation, which is a Dutch &quot;publicly financed fund for visual art and cultural heritage.&quot; It appeared in Portugal at the Ute Meta Bauer&#x27;s Women Building Exhibition; in Amsterdam at the Mediamatic art space; and in &quot;Artforum.&quot; Lambert-Beatty notes that Claire Bishop, an art historian, critic, and professor of art, interprets the A-Portable as &quot;new political art.&quot;

==Voyages==
In 2002, after contentious debate in the Dutch parliament, The Netherlands&#x27; Minister of Health, Els Borst, gave permission to medical personnel on board the Women on Waves ship to offer pregnant women RU-486, known colloquially as the abortion pill, on board their boat, &quot;Aurora&quot;. According to Borst, the decision was in line with the Dutch government&#x27;s policy on the issue of sexual independence of women. The permission was given on the condition that the abortion pill would only be used to terminate pregnancies of up to nine weeks and would be provided in the presence of a gynaecologist.

Abortion and reproductive laws only extend as far as national borders, including nautical borders. Because of this, Women on waves makes use of added freedom in international waters. The boat sails 20 miles from shore, and takes a day to perform its procedures.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a ship must sail under the flag of one nation and may not change it in a port of call, save in the case of a transfer of ownership. this gives Women on Waves the status to sail under Dutch jurisdiction.

===Ireland===
Women on Waves made its maiden voyage aboard the &quot;Aurora&quot; to Ireland in 2001. The ship carried two Dutch doctors and one Dutch nurse. The stated purpose of Women on Waves Ireland was to &quot;catalyze&quot; the Irish movement to liberalize Ireland&#x27;s abortion laws. At the time, Ireland had the most stringent prohibitions against abortion in Europe, with laws forbidding the procedure that dated to 1861. Women on Waves Ireland provided education about abortion and unwanted pregnancy to individuals and to groups in workshops. On that journey, they were not allowed to do surgical or medical abortions, and were limited by Dutch law to provide only information on contraceptives, and not the contraceptives themselves. The ship had been invited by Irish abortion rights organizations which coordinated a publicity campaign in advance of the &quot;Aurora&#x27;s&quot; arrival. The ship anchored at Dublin Port, and traveled into international waters to provide educational services as Ireland&#x27;s law prohibited discussion about abortion and contraceptives. During the ship&#x27;s visit to Dublin Port, approximately 300 women participated. All of the ship&#x27;s services were provided for free.

In 2016, Women on Waves collaborated with pro-abortion group to use drones and speed boats to deliver abortion pills to women in Northern Ireland.

===Poland===
WoW sailed the &quot;Langenort&quot; to Poland in 2003. Women on Waves was charged with violating Poland&#x27;s laws against abortion by bringing RU-486, also known as the abortion drug, into Poland. While docked, protesters pelted fake blood and eggs at the ship. Four months afterward, the government of Poland dropped the charges, noting that there was no evidence that Women on Waves had violated Poland&#x27;s laws. Poland&#x27;s official polling company, Centrum Badania Opinii Spolecznej, found that prior to WoW&#x27;s visit, 44% of the population supported the liberalization of abortion laws, and that after the visit, the percentage rose to 56%. In 2015, WoW flew a drone carrying abortion pills from Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany across the border to Slubice, Poland. German police attempted to prevent the drones from leaving, but were unsuccessful. Polish police confiscated the drones and the personal iPads of the drones&#x27; pilots.

===Portugal===
In 2004, the ship &quot;Borndiep,&quot; carrying the A-Portable, was physically blocked by a naval warship as it attempted to enter Portuguese waters. In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiffs in &quot;Women on Waves and Others v. Portugal&quot;. The court determined that although Portugal had a right to enforce its laws prohibiting abortion, the nation could have enforced the law in less harmful ways, e.g. by sequestering the abortion drugs that were on board the ship.

===Spain===
In 2008, Women on Waves&#x27; ship landed in Valencia, Spain, where it had a mixed reception. Some demonstrators supported the group, others opposed it. According to Catholic News Agency,
&quot;On 18 October a group of 40 feminists gathered to counter the pro-life protests, which brought out four times as many people. They passed out boxes of matches with the picture of a burning church and the caption, &#x27;The only church that brings light is the one that burns. Join us!&#x27;

On 19 October the feminists met again to distribute matches but decided to disband after they were overwhelmed by the large number of pro-life protesters who gathered at the port where the abortion ship was docked.&quot;
As the ship attempted to dock amid protesters on both sides of the issue, harbor patrol agents in a small boat lassoed a rope around the helm of the ship and attempted to pull it away from the dock.

===Morocco===
Ibtissam Lachgar of MALI (&quot;Mouvement alternatif pour les libertés individuelles&quot;) invited Women on Waves to visit Morocco in 2012. On 3 October 2012, the Moroccan health ministry closed the port of Smir to prevent the entry of the Women on Waves ship &quot;Langenort&quot;. This was the first attempt by Women on Waves to make landfall in a Muslim-majority country. Anti-abortion protesters were present, many carrying signs against abortion. The activist Rebecca Gomperts was at the port to meet the ship, but she was escorted away upon encountering the protesters.

===Guatemala===
On 22 February 2017, the WoW ship docked in Puerto Quetzal on the Pacific coast for a planned five-day visit. On 23 February, a scheduled press conference was shut down shortly after it started
and a blockade was imposed by Army troops, preventing the activists from disembarking and visitors from boarding. Catholic and other religious leaders and politicians spoke vociferously against the ship and its mission: &quot; &#x27;The boat of death has arrived in Guatemala&#x27;, said lawmaker Raul Romero during a Congress session earlier on Wednesday.&quot; The WoW ship was ejected into international waters by a Guatemalan military ship. The argument to expel the boat was that they lied to the immigration authorities by saying that they were tourists, but in reality they are a health organization that aims to provide abortions to women.

===Mexico===

In April 2017, the Adelaide ship docked in Ixtapa, Mexico, where abortion procedures were illegal in much of the country. To administer the procedures, the crew ferried the women seeking abortions from Mexico’s Pacific coast to the international waters, where Mexican criminal law was not in effect for the ship.

==Documentary==
In 2014 &quot;Vessel&quot;, a documentary by Diana Whitten focusing on Women on Waves, premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, where it won the &quot;Best Documentary Feature&quot; audience and special jury awards. &#x27;Vessel&#x27; was received fairly positively by critics and audiences. Courtney Small of Cinema Axis called it an &quot;electrifying&quot; look at Gomperts&#x27; operation and Ben Kenigsberg of the New York Times called it an &quot;unabashed work of advocacy.&quot; The Hollywood Reporter&#x27;s review said it was unlikely to change audience&#x27;s opinions on abortion, but called it a moving film. It has a Metacritic Metascore of 68.

The film has garnered multiple other awards including the Audience Award for Documentary in Competition and a Special Jury Award for Political Courage.

== Feminist activism ==
In an academic article published in &quot;Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society&quot;, Carrie Lambert-Beatty claims that &quot;the vessel [is] one of the most audacious instances of feminist activism in recent memory.&quot;

<text>Sanlitun () is an area of the Chaoyang District, Beijing containing many bars, restaurants, and stores. It is a popular destination for shopping, dining, and entertainment.
The area has been under almost constant regeneration since the late 20th century as part of a citywide project of economic regrowth. It currently houses many bars and clubs popular with both locals and foreigners as well as international brand-name stores such as Uniqlo, Apple, Nike, Adidas, KFC and Nathan&#x27;s Famous. It is notable for housing the largest Adidas store in the world.

== History ==
Prior to 1949, the Beijing Legation Quarter was the center of diplomatic activity in the capital. After the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the government wanted to move the diplomatic district outside the inner city. Sanlitun was chosen as the area where foreign legations and embassies were to be reallocated in the late 1950s. The area was called Sanlitun to designate its location from Dongzhimen gate (), with &quot;tun&quot; meaning &#x27;locality&#x27; and &quot;san li&quot; meanings &#x27;three &quot;li&quot;&#x27; (a &quot;li&quot; is 0.5 km), so that the name means &quot;locality 1.5 km away (from Dongzhimen Gate)&quot;.

Sanlitun began to grow when, along with the economic reforms of the late 1970s and early 1980s, bars serving expatriates and later locals began to open. International hotels introduced the first bars, but in the 1990s, standalone establishments appeared. Accounts differ over which was the first bar in Sanlitun, with one author crediting the Cat Cafe in 1995 while another names Frank&#x27;s Place, which opened in 1990.

The first supermarket in Beijing opened in Sanlitun in November 1982. This supermarket has an area about 300 square meters, selling a variety of products.

The first bar on North Sanlitun Rd opened in 1995. After nearly 30 years, Sanlitun houses about 70% of bars in Beijing.

South Sanlitun Rd used to have stores selling auto parts. After the construction of the Bar Street, those stores are demolished.

Sanlitun Village opened in 2008, giving the area many new shops, restaurants, bars and a multiplex cinema. In 2013, Sanlitun Village changed its name to Taikoo Li Sanlitun.

Sanlitun saw significant new construction as part of preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In April 2008, as part of an ongoing operation to clean up the city, a major drug bust occurred in Sanlitun and many arrests were made. A total of four bars and clubs were effectively closed, including a notorious bar known as Pure Girl for its cheap alcohol and availability of drugs, both its bartender and manager were executed for distribution of drugs. However, it has since reopened a year later with new management. The police operation was widely criticized for its violence and absence of proper due process. A number of drug dealers as well as a barman are believed to have received the death penalty as a result of this operation.

The Uniqlo in Taikoo Li Sanlitun gained international attention after it was the site of a July 2015 sex tape that was filmed inside one of the store&#x27;s fitting rooms. Uniqlo denied any involvement in the video.

In an August 2015 incident near the Uniqlo, a Chinese woman was killed and her French husband was wounded in an attack by a sword-wielding man.

On 25 December 2015, following the November 2015 Paris attacks by ISIS, several foreign embassies in Beijing warned of possible threats against Westerners in the Sanlitun shopping district on or around Christmas Day, urging their citizens to &quot;exercise heightened vigilance.&quot;

A popular destination for foreigners and young people was the &quot;dirty street&quot; of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and bars at the center of Sanlitun. However, the street was cleaned up in 2017.

As a landmark of Beijing, Sanlitun becomes a popular place to be chosen as the setting in many films and TV series. The films and TV series include Mr. Six, Love Is Not Blind, and A Little Reunion.

<text>Radio Jackie is an Independent Local Radio station in Kingston upon Thames, England broadcasting news, popular hits, and local information to South-West London and North Surrey from its studios in Tolworth.

== History ==
Radio Jackie began as a pirate station first broadcasting in March 1969. Jackie broadcast on the 1525 kHz frequency and soon became one of the most popular pirate stations in the country. It changed frequency several times, settling on 1332 kHz in 1978 when the new European frequency guidelines were implemented. From February 1971, it also broadcast on FM on 94.4 MHz every Saturday evening.

By the early 1980s, Radio Jackie had become a 24-hour-a-day local station with studios in Worcester Park and a shop in Morden. It employed full-time staff, was VAT-registered and had an entry in the phone directory—a very public operation for an illegal broadcaster. The station had huge public support with local borough councils and MPs supporting its wish to gain a licence. In 1972, a recording of the station was even played in the House of Commons at the committee stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill, as an example of what local radio could sound like. 

In the mid-1980s, however, new laws meant that the days of pirate stations were numbered, and as one of the highest-profile stations Radio Jackie was an early target. Despite huge local protests the station ceased broadcasting on 4 February 1985. At the time it was south west London&#x27;s second most popular station.

== Licence==
Ten years after their pirate radio closedown, in 1996, Tony Collis made efforts to bring the station back as a legal broadcaster when the South-West London licence was advertised. A detailed set of plans were produced with a lot of community content, but the Radio Authority (now Ofcom) awarded Thames the licence on 107.8 FM. Over the years Thames Radio, as it was later renamed, fell into financial difficulty, and in 2003, the Radio Authority gave the original chairman Tony Collis permission to make a bid for the station. He purchased Thames Radio and Radio Jackie was relaunched on 107.8 MHz on Sunday 19 October 2003. The first song played was The Cars - &#x27;Heartbeat City&#x27; because the chorus contains the lyrics &#x27;Oh Jacki what took you so long&#x27;. The first on air presenter was ex-Radio Atlantis presenter Dave Owen, who was the last presenter on Radio Jackie when the station closed down in 1985, with BBC Radio 2 DJ David Jacobs installed as chairperson.

Radio Jackie transmits from the top of Tolworth Tower.

==Legacy==
Radio Jackie celebrated 50 years since first broadcasting in March 2019.

<text>John Colin Dunlop FRSE (1785–1842) was a Scottish advocate and historian.

==Life==
He was born near Glasgow on 30 December 1785 the son of John Dunlop, of Rosebank, Glasgow, who was Lord Provost of Glasgow, 1794–1796.

John Colin was studious and reclusive. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1807 in 1807, but was only nominally at the Scottish bar. He became sheriff-depute of Renfrewshire in 1816 and served this role until his death.

He worked with the firm of Dunlop Rowand &amp; Co at 63 St Vincent Street in central Glasgow.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1833 his proposers being Alexander Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank and Sir Thomas Dick Lauder.

In later life he lived at 12 India Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s Second New Town.

He died in Edinburgh on 26 January 1842.

<text>Amination is the process by which an amine group is introduced into an organic molecule. This type of reaction is important because organonitrogen compounds are pervasive.

==Reactions==
===Aminase enzymes===
Enzymes that catalyse this reaction are termed aminases. Amination can occur in a number of ways including reaction with ammonia or another amine such as an alkylation, reductive amination and the Mannich reaction.

===Acid-catalysed hydroamination===
Many alkyl amines are produced industrially by the amination of alcohols using ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts. Illustrative is the production of &quot;tert&quot;-butylamine:
:NH3 + CH2=C(CH3)2 → H2NC(CH3)3
The Ritter reaction of isobutene with hydrogen cyanide is not useful in this case because it produces too much waste.

=== Electrophilic amination ===
Usually, the amine reacts as the nucleophile with another organic compound acting as the electrophile. This sense of reactivity may be reversed for some electron-deficient amines, including oxaziridines, hydroxylamines, oximes, and other N–O substrates. When the amine is used as an electrophile, the reaction is called electrophilic amination. Electron-rich organic substrates that may be used as nucleophiles for this process include carbanions and enolates.

===Miscellaneous methods===
Alpha hydroxy acids can be converted into amino acids directly using aqueous ammonia solution, hydrogen gas and a heterogeneous metallic ruthenium catalyst.

===Metal-catalyzed hydroamination===
In hydroamination, amines add to alkenes. When substituted amines add, the result is alkene carboamination.

<doc id="999011" wikidata="Q38634" url="?curid=999011" title="Black Russian Terrier">
<text>The Black Russian Terrier (), also known as the Chornyi Terrier (&quot;chornyi&quot; being Russian for black), is a breed of dog from the USSR. It was originally bred in the Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel during the late 1940s and the early 1950s for use as a military/working dog. The Black Russian Terrier is a breed recognized by the FCI (September 1983), AKC (July 2004), CKC, KC, ANKC, NZKC and other cynological organizations. The contemporary Black Russian Terrier is a working dog, guarding dog, sporting and companion dog.

Despite its name, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true terrier: it is believed that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale Terrier, the Giant Schnauzer, the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, the South Russian Shepherd Dog and other breeds.

==History==
The Black Russian Terrier was developed in the former USSR in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel by the state for use as a military/working dogs. The breeding stock was largely imported from countries where the Red Army was active during the Second World War, especially East Germany. Breeds used in the development include the Giant Schnauzer, Airedale Terrier, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Caucasian Shepherd Dog, South Russian Shepherd Dog and other breeds. The Black Russian Terrier was bred for working ability, rather than appearance, and early examples only resembled today&#x27;s Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type. They were bred solely by the state owned Red Star Kennel in Moscow until 1957, when some puppies were sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks (as the original was rather plain) while retaining working ability. In time, the breed spread to the other parts of USSR like Saint Petersburg, Siberia, Ukraine and later to the first European country Finland and next to the other European countries: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and finally to the United States, Canada, Australia and others.

In 1955 the first working examples of the breed were put on show at an exhibition in Moscow and the first Breed Standard was published in 1958, which was then adopted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1984. In 1996 The Russian Federation Working Dog-breeders &amp; Russian Kynological Federation (RKF) adopted a second Standard for the breed more in line to the modern day Russian Black Terrier. And it was also in 1996 that the breed was first introduced into the UK. In 1998 The Kennel Club added the Russian Black Terrier to the Import Register.

The coat is a double coat with a coarse outer guard hair over a softer undercoat. The coat is hard and dense, never soft, woolly, silky or frizzy. It should be trimmed to between in length. It should form a beard and eyebrows on the face, and a slight mane around the withers and neck that is more pronounced in males. The coat is low-shedding and the colour is black or black with some scattered gray hairs.

===Size===

According to the FCI standard the male stands 72 to 76 cm and not more than 78 cm at the withers compared to the female&#x27;s 68–72 cm and not more than 74 cm. The male weighs between , and the females weigh between . Nowadays, even larger individuals are tolerated if the dog is well proportioned and retains correct movements. Dogs exhibited by the kennel club are slightly taller by about half an inch.

At maturity (over 18 months of age), the AKC standard recommends 27-30 inches for males with the desired height between 27 and 29 inches and 26 and 29 inches for females with the desired height between 26 and 28 inches. A mature male less than 27 inches or more than 30 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. A mature female less than 26 inches or more than 29 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. Although the standard also states &quot;Height consideration should not outweigh that of type, proportion, movement and other functional attributes.&quot; In proportions, a Black Russian Terrier should be slightly longer than tall, a ratio of 9 ½ to 10 being ideal.

==Care==

The Black Russian Terrier, because of its breeding as a working dog, has a very strong &quot;work ethic&quot;, and needs a job to do in order to be happy. Early training is a must and they are very responsive to firm, consistent training, excelling at obedience competitions. They also perform well in other dog sports, such as agility, and Schutzhund training. They have a low-shedding coat, and need grooming several times a week. Dogs who compete in conformation need to be groomed a minimum of every three weeks to keep the coat in show condition. This breed forms a strong bond with a single person and will not thrive if sent to boarding facilities. The young Black Russian Terrier should not be forced to exercise as a pup and tend to sleep the majority of the day because they grow so quickly [around 1 kg per week], they may become hyperactive and destructive when older if not provided an outlet for its energy. Once the dog has reached maturity their energy level decreases dramatically and they are most content laying near their owner.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The Black Russian Terrier is prone to certain hereditary diseases:

Major concerns:

* Hip dysplasia
* Elbow dysplasia
* Hyperuricosuria
* Juvenile laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathy

Minor concerns

* Hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD): a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies
* Panosteitis (pano or wandering lameness): a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies
* Heart disease: the most common heart problems are aortic stenosis, mitral valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy
* Eyes disease: the most common eyes problems are ectropion, entropion, conjunctivitis
* Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, contact allergies and inhalant allergies

Other problems

* Hot spot
* Fungal infection—especially in ears and beard area

<doc id="999014" wikidata="Q3218889" url="?curid=999014" title="Laurence Echard">
<text>Laurence Echard (c. 1670–1730) was an English historian and clergyman. He wrote a &quot;History of England&quot; that was a standard work in its time.

==Life==
Echard was the son of the Rev. Thomas Echard or Eachard of Barsham, Suffolk, by his wife, the daughter of Samuel and Dorothy Groome, and was born at Barsham. On 26 May 1687, at the age of 17, he was admitted as a sizar of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1692 and M.A. in 1695. Having been ordained by John Moore, bishop of Norwich, he was presented to the livings of Welton and Elkington, Lincolnshire, and appointed chaplain to the Bishop of Lincoln.

For more than 20 years Echard remained in Lincolnshire, chiefly at Louth, and wrote several works. On 24 April 1697 he was installed as prebendary of Louth at Lincoln Cathedral, and on 12 August 1712 as Archdeacon of Stow. In or about 1722 Echard was presented by George I with the livings of Rendlesham and Sudbourne in Suffolk. There he lived in bad health for nearly eight years. He died at Lincoln, while on his way to Scarborough for the benefit of the waters, on 16 August 1730, and was buried in the chancel of St Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Church on the 29th of that month.

==Works==
Echard translated Terence, some Plautus, and Pierre Joseph d&#x27;Orléans&#x27; &quot;History of the Revolutions in England&quot;. He made numerous compilations on history, geography and the classics. His chief work is &quot;The History of England: from the first entrance of Julius Caesar and the Romans to the end of the reign of King James the First containing the space of 1678 years&quot; (several editions published by Jacob Tonson between 1707 and 1720), covering the period from the Roman occupation to his own times. This continued to be the standard work on the subject until Nicolas Tindal&#x27;s translations and expansions of Rapin de Thoyras&#x27;s French &quot;Histoire d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (&quot;History of England&quot;) began to appear in English in 1727. Echard also wrote a history of the Roman republic from its founding to the Augustan settlement.

Echard also compiled &quot;The Gazetteer&#x27;s, or Newsman&#x27;s Interpreter&quot; (1st edition, 1692), a geographical index the name of which is thought to have given rise to the use of the word &quot;&quot; to mean &quot;a dictionary or index of geographical locations&quot;. In the preface, Echard said &quot;The Title was given me by a very eminent Person, whom I forbear to name&quot;, and that the work was &quot;partly design&#x27;d for all such as frequent Coffee-Houses, and other places for News&quot;, that is, to help readers better understand the newspapers written by &quot;gazetteers&quot;, an archaic term for journalists.

==Family==
Echard married first Jane, daughter of the Rev. Potter of Yorkshire, and secondly Justin, daughter of Robert Wooley of Well, Lincolnshire. There were no children by either marriage.

In November 2003, approximately from the Azores, &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; conducted her first live firings of these missile systems. The firings involved a single ESSM and a single SM-2. These firings were particularly significant in that they were the first ever live firings involving a full-size ship-borne Active Electronically Scanned Array (i.e., APAR) guiding missiles using the Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination (ICWI) technique in an operational environment. As related by Jane&#x27;s Navy International:

Further live firings were performed by &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; in March 2005, again in the Atlantic Ocean approximately west of the Azores. The tests involved three live-firing events including firing a single SM-2 at an Iris target drone at long range, a single ESSM at an Iris target drone, and a two-salvo launch (with one salvo comprising two SM-2s and the other comprising two ESSMs) against two incoming Iris target drones. The long-range SM-2 engagement apparently resulted in an intercept at a range of greater than from the ship, with a missile-target miss distance of (the warhead&#x27;s proximity fuze having been disabled for the purposes of the test).

On 24 October 2015 &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; performed maritime integrated air and missile defense during a At Sea Demonstration (ASD).

In May, 2021 during At Sea Demonstration/Formidable Shield 2021 &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; detected and tracked a ballistic missile with SMART-L radar and relayed the target information to . The intercepted and destroyed the ballistic missile with SM-3 surface-to-air missile. During the exercise it also performed a Plot Level Data Exchange and Fusion (PLDEF) with the French frigate &quot;Forbin&quot;.

<text>Colin Ireland (16 March 1954 – 21 February 2012) was a British serial killer known as the Gay Slayer, because his victims were gay. Criminologist David Wilson believes that Ireland was a psychopath.

Ireland suffered a severely dysfunctional upbringing. He committed various crimes from the age of 16 and had served time in borstals and prisons. While living in Southend, he started frequenting the Coleherne, a gay pub in Earl&#x27;s Court, London. Ireland sought men who liked the passive role and sado-masochism, so he could readily restrain them as they initially believed it was a sexual game.

Ireland said he was heterosexual: he had been twice married to women and that he pretended to be gay only to befriend potential victims. Ireland claimed that his murders were not sexually motivated. He was highly organised and carried a full murder kit of rope, handcuffs and a full change of clothes to each murder. After killing his victim he cleaned the flat of any forensic evidence linking him to the scene and stayed in the flat until morning in order to avoid arousing suspicion from leaving in the middle of the night.

Ireland was sentenced to five counts of life imprisonment for the murders on 20 December 1993 and remained imprisoned until his death on 21 February 2012, at the age of 57.

== Early life ==
Ireland was born in 1954 in Dartford, Kent, to an unmarried teenage couple; shortly after his birth, his father left him and his 17-year-old mother. His father is not named on his birth certificate, and Ireland did not know his identity. He was raised in poverty and moved home many times. When his mother married and became pregnant she put Ireland into care, although he was later returned to her. She went on to remarry in 1966.

During the 1960s in Sheerness, Kent, Ireland was propositioned on three occasions and spied on once by men who were paedophiles. In his mid-teens, he was sent to borstal for theft, and whilst there, deliberately set fire to another resident&#x27;s belongings. At age 17, Ireland was convicted of robbery. He escaped and was returned to borstal.

== Early adulthood ==
In the attempt to make ends meet, Ireland had a series of manual jobs, then in December 1975, he was convicted of car theft, criminal damage and two burglaries, for which he was sentenced to 18 months&#x27; imprisonment. Ireland was released in November 1976 and moved to Swindon, Wiltshire. He lived with a woman and her children for a few months. In 1977, he was convicted of extortion, for which he was sentenced to 18 months&#x27; imprisonment. In 1980, he was convicted of robbery, for which he was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. In 1981, he was convicted of attempted deception. 

In 1982, Ireland married Virginia Zammit; the couple and their daughter lived in the Holloway area of London. In 1985, he was convicted and sentenced to six months for &quot;going equipped to cheat&quot;. He divorced in 1987 after his wife discovered he had committed adultery. In 1989, in Devon, he married Janet Young; he was violent towards her and stole from her. In the early 1990s, they separated; she and her children became homeless. He moved to Southend-on-Sea, where he became homeless and lived in a hostel. He later moved to his own flat. Whilst living there, he travelled to the Coleherne Arms, a gay pub in Earl&#x27;s Court, London, where he first met his victims.

== Victims ==

=== Peter Walker ===
Peter Walker, a 45-year-old choreographer, took Ireland back to his flat in Battersea. There he was bound, and ultimately suffocated by a plastic bag being placed over his head. Ireland placed two teddy bears in a 69 position on the body. He left Walker&#x27;s dogs locked in another room. The day after the murder, having heard no news reports of the crime, he called the Samaritans and a journalist from &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, advising them of the dogs, and that he had murdered their owner. He told them he wanted to become famous for being a serial killer. A former boyfriend of Walker was later interviewed and told the police that Walker did not enjoy sadomasochism and was most likely forced into it by Ireland.

=== Christopher Dunn ===
Dunn was a 37-year-old librarian who lived in Wealdstone. He was found naked in a harness. His death was initially believed to be an accident that occurred during an erotic game. In addition, because he lived in a different area from Walker, a different set of investigators worked on the case. For these reasons, the death was not initially linked to Walker&#x27;s.

=== Perry Bradley III ===
Ireland met 35-year-old businessman Perry Bradley III at the Coleherne pub. Bradley lived in Kensington and was the son of Texas Democratic Party fundraiser Perry Bradley Jr.

The two men returned to Bradley&#x27;s flat, where Ireland suggested that he tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland told him that he was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own bed, face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley&#x27;s money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley&#x27;s flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn&#x27;t be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley&#x27;s neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley&#x27;s flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man&#x27;s body.

=== Andrew Collier ===
Ireland, angered that he had received no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier&#x27;s home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men went to the window to investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal metal bar that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints.

Once he had tied up his victim on the bed, Ireland again demanded his victim&#x27;s bank details. This time his victim refused to comply. After killing Collier&#x27;s cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier&#x27;s penis and placed the dead cat&#x27;s mouth over it, and placed the cat&#x27;s tail into Collier&#x27;s mouth. Ireland was angered at discovering Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking why they had not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with £70.

A suspected reason for his killing of the cat was that after Ireland killed Walker and had left this previous victim&#x27;s dogs locked in a separate room, he later called anonymously to advise parties to the fact that these dogs were being or had been locked up. As a result, the media called the killer an animal lover. He strangled the cat to demonstrate that the &quot;animal lover&quot; assumption had been wrong.

=== Emanuel Spiteri ===

Ireland&#x27;s fifth victim was a Maltese chef named Emanuel Spiteri, aged 41, whom he had met at the Coleherne pub. Spiteri was persuaded to be cuffed and bound on his bed. Once more, Ireland demanded his PIN but did not obtain it. He again used a noose to kill. After carrying out his post-murder ritual of cleaning and clearing the scene, Ireland set fire to the flat and left, however the fire only caused minor damage. He rang the police later to tell them to look for a body at the scene of a fire and added that he would probably not kill again.

==Criminal case==
=== Investigation ===

There are suggestions that homophobia on the part of the police delayed the linking of all the murders and that they were initially not handled well, but police eventually connected all five killings. The crimes were publicised by the mass media and it quickly became known in the gay community that a serial killer was specifically targeting gay men.

Investigations revealed that Spiteri had left the Coleherne pub and travelled home with his killer by train, and a security video successfully captured the two of them on the railway platform at Charing Cross station. Ireland recognised himself and decided to tell police he was the man with Spiteri but not the killer—he claimed to have left Spiteri in the flat with another man. However, police had also found fingerprints in Collier&#x27;s flat, which they linked to Ireland.

=== Trial, convictions and imprisonment ===
Ireland was charged with the murders of Collier and Spiteri and confessed to the other three while awaiting trial in prison. He told police that he had no vendetta against gay men, but picked on them because they were the easiest targets. Ireland pretended to be gay in order to lure his victims. He had robbed those he killed because he was unemployed at the time, and he needed funds to travel to and from London when hunting for victims.

When his case came to the Old Bailey on 20 December 1993, Ireland admitted all charges and was given life sentences for each. The judge, Mr Justice Sachs, said he was &quot;exceptionally frightening and dangerous&quot;, adding: &quot;To take one human life is an outrage; to take five is carnage.&quot;

On 22 December 2006, Ireland was one of 35 life sentence prisoners whose names appeared on the Home Office&#x27;s list of prisoners who had been issued with whole life tariffs and were unlikely ever to be released.

Ireland&#x27;s crimes received sensationalist coverage in the tabloid press. As well as the nickname &quot;The Gay Slayer&quot;, he was headlined as &quot;Jack The Gripper&quot; by the &quot;News of the World&quot;.

== Death ==

Ireland died on 21 February 2012, at Wakefield Prison. A spokeswoman for Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service said: &quot;He is presumed to have died from natural causes; a post-mortem will follow.&quot; Later, his death was ascribed to pulmonary fibrosis and a fractured hip he had suffered earlier in the month as preliminary causes of death.

<doc id="999054" wikidata="Q445432" url="?curid=999054" title="Shirin">
<text>Shirin (; died 628) was wife of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II (). In the revolution after the death of Khosrow&#x27;s father Hormizd IV, the General Bahram Chobin took power over the Persian empire. Shirin fled with Khosrow to Roman Syria, where they lived under the protection of Byzantine emperor Maurice.

In 591, Khosrow returned to Persia to take control of the empire and Shirin was made queen. She used her new influence to support the Christian minority in Iran, but the political situation demanded that she do so discreetly. Initially, she belonged to the Church of the East but later she joined the miaphysite church of Antioch, now known as the Syriac Orthodox Church. After the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem of 614 amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the Sasanians captured the True Cross of Jesus and brought it to their capital Ctesiphon, where Shirin took the cross in her palace.

Long after her death Shirin became an important heroine of Persian literature, as a model of a faithful lover and wife. She appears in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and the romance &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot; by Nizami Ganjavi (1141−1209), and is referred to in very many other works. Her elaborated story in literature bears little or no resemblance to the fairly few known historical facts of her life, although her Christianity and difficulties after the assassination of her husband remain part of the story, as well as Khosrow&#x27;s exile before he regained his throne. After their first accidental meeting, when Khosrow was initially unaware of her identity, their courtship takes a number of twists and turns, with the pair often apart, that occupy most of the story. After Khosrow&#x27;s son kills him, the son demands that Shirin marry him, which she avoids by committing suicide.

== Origin == 
The background of Shirin is uncertain. According to the 7th-century Armenian historian Sebeos (died after 661), she was a native of Khuzistan in southwestern Iran. However, two Syriac chronicles state that she was &quot;Aramean&quot; i.e., from the region of Beth Aramaye. The Persian historian Mirkhvand (died 1498), writing much later, states that she used to be a servant in a Persian house which Khosrow II used to regularly visit during his teens. The 11th-century Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;) of Ferdowsi (died 1019/1025), which was based on the Middle Persian text &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; (&quot;Book of Lords&quot;), states that Shirin was already married to Khosrow II by the time he fled to the Byzantine Empire. None of these reports are substantiated by earlier sources, which may indicate that they were later established legends. The early 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta does not mention the names of the two women who fled with Khosrow II.

The tradition identifying Shirin as Armenian appears to be of later origin.

== Marriage ==

The earliest source mentioning Shirin is the Ecclesiastical history of Evagrius Scholasticus, where she is mentioned as &quot;Sira&quot;. It preserves a letter sent by Khosrau II to the shrine of Saint Sergius in Resafa. One dated to 592/593 includes the following passage: &quot;At the time when I [Khosrau II] was at Beramais, I begged of thee, O holy one, that thou wouldest come to my aid, and that Sira might conceive: and inasmuch as Sira was a Christian and I a heathen, and our law forbids us to have a Christian wife, nevertheless, on account of my favourable feelings towards thee, I disregarded the law as respects her, and among my wives I have constantly esteemed, and do still esteem her as peculiarly mine.&quot;

&quot;Thus I resolved to request of thy goodness, O Saint, that she might conceive: and I made the request with a vow, that, if Sira should conceive, I would send the cross she wears to thy venerable sanctuary. On this account both I and Sira purposed to retain this cross in memory of thy name, O Saint, and in place of it to send five thousand staters, as its value, which does not really exceed four thousand four hundred staters. From the time that I conceived this request and these intentions, until I reached Rhosochosron, not more than ten days elapsed, when thou, O Saint, not on account of my worthiness but thy kindness, appearedst to me in a vision of the night and didst thrice tell me that Sira should conceive, while, in the same vision, thrice I replied, It is well.&quot;

&quot;From that day forward Sira has not experienced the custom of women, because thou art the granter of requests; though I, had I not believed thy words, and that thou art holy and the granter of requests, should have doubted that she would not thenceforward experience the custom of women. From this circumstance I was convinced of the power of the vision and the truth of thy words, and accordingly forthwith sent the same cross and its value to thy venerable sanctuary, with directions that out of that sum should be made a disc, and a cup for the purposes of the divine mysteries, as also a cross to be fixed upon the holy table, and a censer, all of gold: also a Hunnish veil adorned with gold. Let the surplus of the sum belong to thy sanctuary, in order that by virtue of thy fortune, O saint, thou mayest come to the aid of me and Sira in all matters, and especially with respect to this petition; and that what has been already procured for us by thy intercession, may be consummated according to the compassion of thy goodness, and the desire of me and Sira; so that both of us, and all persons in the world, may trust in thy power and continue to believe in thee.&quot;

Theophylact Simocatta gives a similar account with additional information. &quot;In the following year the Persian king [Khosrau II] proclaimed as queen Seirem [Shirin] who was of Roman birth and Christian religion, and of an age blossoming for marriage, slept with her. ... &quot;In the third year he entreated Sergius, the most efficacious in Persia, that a child by Seirem be granted to him. Shortly afterwards this came to pass for him. The Roman (Byzantine) ancestry of Shirin is contradicted by Sebeos: &quot;[Xosrov], in accordance with their Magian religion, had numerous wives. He also took Christian wives, and had an extremely beautiful Christian wife from the land of Xuzhastan named Shirin, the Bambish, queen of queens [tiknats&#x27; tikin]. She constructed a monastery and a church close to the royal abode, and settled priests and deacons there allotting from the court stipends and money for clothing. She lavished gold and silver [on the monastery]. Bravely, with her head held high she preached the gospel of the Kingdom, at court, and none of the grandee mages dared open his mouth to say anything—large or small—about Christians. When, however, days passed and her end approached, many of the mages who had converted to Christianity, were martyred in various places.&quot;

The &quot;Khuzistan Chronicle&quot;, written by an Assyrian Christian from Khuzestan [Iran] probably in 680 is described as the Syriac counterpart of the Armenian work of Sebeos. We read about the relationship between the Catholicos Isho Yahb II and the persian king Khosrau II. Parvez (590-628) : &quot;Isho Yahb was treated respectfully throughout his life, by the king himself and his two christian wives Shirin the Aramean and Mary the Roman&quot;. (Theodor. Nöldeke: &quot;Die von Guidi herausgegebene syrische Chronik&quot;, Wien 1893, p. 10)

The &quot;Chronicle of Séert&quot; (Siirt) is an anonymously authored historiographical text written by the Church of the East in Persia and the Middle East, possibly as early as the 9th century AD. The text deals with ecclesiastical, social, and political issues of the Christian church giving a history of its leaders and notable members.
LVIII. - History of Khosrau Parvez, son of Hormizd &quot;Khosrau, by gratitude for Maurice, ordered to rebuild churches and to honor the Christians. He built himself two churches for Marie (Maryam) and a large church and a castle in the country of Beth Lashpar for his wife Shirin, the Aramean.&quot; (Patrologia Orientalis, Tome VII. - Fascicule 2, &quot;Histoire Nestorienne&quot; (&quot;Chronique de Séert&quot;), Seconde Partie (1), publiée et traduite par Mgr Addai Scher, Paris 1911, Published Paris : Firmin-Didot 1950 p. 467.)

Khosrow created several cities named after his lover Shirin, including the modern city Qasr-e Shirin, which means palace of Shirin.

<text>Edmund Cooper (30 April 1926 – 11 March 1982) was an English poet and prolific writer of speculative fiction, romances, technical essays, several detective stories, and a children&#x27;s book. These were published under his own name and several pen names.

==Biography==
Born in Marple, near Stockport, Cheshire, Cooper left school at the age of 15. In 1942 he became engaged at 16 to a teacher four years older than he was, and married her four years later on 13 April 1946. He worked as a labourer, then a civil servant, and in 1944 he joined the Merchant Navy. After the war he trained as a teacher, and began to publish verse, then short stories, then novels. &quot;Deadly Image&quot;, the first novel to appear under his own name, was completed in 1957 and published in 1958 in the United States. (The novel was published in the UK later in 1958 in a variant form and under its better-known title &quot;The Uncertain Midnight&quot;.) &quot;The Uncertain Midnight&quot; was adapted without authorisation for Swiss television in 1969. His short story &quot;The Brain Child&quot; (1956) was adapted as the movie &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot; (1957), which featured the return of Robby the Robot from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

Cooper reviewed science fiction for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; from 1967 until his death in 1982.

In 2009, Carol Lake published &quot;Those Summers at Moon Farm&quot; (United Writers, Cornwall: 978-1-85200-141-4), a roman à clef about the writer and family. The author&#x27;s comments says &#x27;Although inspired by real people, this story is fiction&#x27;. Dedicated in part to Joan and Edmund Cooper, Lake acknowledges one of Cooper&#x27;s daughters, &#x27;for sharing memories and anecdotes&#x27;.

==Work and criticism==
Cooper was an atheist and an individualist. His science fiction often depicts unconventional male heroes facing unfamiliar and remote environments. His novel &quot;The Uncertain Midnight&quot; was noted for its treatment of the subject of androids, which was considered original at the time of writing. Also treated is the subject of the colonisation of planets, which is the basis of Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Expendables&quot; series, published under the pen name Richard Avery (the name of the hero of &quot;Transit&quot;). The &quot;Expendables&quot; series features an unusual diversity, both in its cast of characters, and in the frank nature of their conversations and attitudes on racial and sexual topics.

Two of Cooper&#x27;s books depict future Earths dominated by women after the genetic or physical need for men has been reduced. His attitude to women is said to have been controversial. Cooper was quoted as saying: &quot;Let them have totally equal competition ... they&#x27;ll see that they can&#x27;t make it.&quot; The theme of both books is actually the need to retain both sexes. &quot;Five to Twelve&quot; ends with the phrase &quot;if we do not make any more mistakes, we can create a balanced world of men and women&quot;. The more cynical &quot;Who Needs Men?&quot; ends by asking whether love of woman for man is worth death for that love.

<text>Boris Pahor, OMRI (; 26 August 1913 – 30 May 2022) was a Slovene novelist from Trieste, Italy, who was best known for his heartfelt descriptions of life as a member of the Slovenian minority in pre–Second World War increasingly fascist Italy as well as a Nazi concentration camp survivor. In his novel &quot;Necropolis&quot; he visits the Natzweiler-Struthof camp twenty years after his relocation to Dachau. Following Dachau, he was relocated three more times: to Mittelbau-Dora, to Harzungen, and finally to Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated on 15 April 1945.

His success was not immediate; openly expressing his disapproval of communism in Yugoslavia, he was not acknowledged and was probably intentionally not recognized by his homeland until after Slovenia had gained its independence in 1991. His autobiographical novel &quot;Nekropola&quot;, published in 1967, was first translated into English (in 1995) as &quot;Pilgrim Among the Shadows&quot;, and secondly (in 2010) as &quot;Necropolis&quot;. The novel has also been translated into several other languages.

Pahor was a prominent public figure in the Slovene minority in Italy, who were affected by Fascist Italianization. Although a member of the Slovene Partisans, he opposed Marxist communism. He was awarded the Legion of Honour by the French government and the Cross of Honour for Science and Art by the Austrian government, and was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He refused the title of &quot;honorary citizen of the capital of Slovenia&quot; because he believed that the Slovene minority in Italy (1920–47) was not supported the way it ought to have been during the period of Fascist Italianization by right-wing or left-wing Slovenian political elites. Pahor was married to the author Radoslava Premrl (1921–2009) and wrote a book dedicated to her at the age of 99. In addition to Slovene and Italian, he was fluent in French. Following the death of Marco Feingold on 19 September 2019, he became the oldest living survivor of the Holocaust.

==Early life under Italian Fascism==

Pahor was born on 26 August 1913 into a Slovene minority community in Trieste, the main port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the capital of the Austrian Littoral region at the time. Pahor&#x27;s father Franc was born in Kostanjevica na Krasu, a settlement that was severely ravaged by the Battles of the Isonzo during the First World War. Franc married Marija Ambrožič and found a job in Trieste as a civil servant in the Austro-Hungarian administration.

Under the Treaty of Rapallo, the Kingdom of Italy annexed territories which included a substantial ethnic Slovene population, and that included a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory and approximately 330,000 out of total population of 1.3 million Slovenes. After the annexation, and even more after Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922, the forced Fascist Italianization of the Slovene minority began.

In 1920, Italian Black shirts in Trieste burned down the Slovene Community Hall (), which the young Pahor witnessed. All non-Italian languages (including Slovene and German) were forbidden as languages of instruction by the Fascist regime three years after this event. Between 1926 and 1932, all Slovene, Croatian, and German toponyms as well as first and last names began to be subjected to Italianization—during which also his future wife&#x27;s name (Radoslava) was changed to Francesca. Fascism had a traumatizing effect on young Pahor, which he remembered in an interview for &quot;Delo&quot; two months before his 100th birthday:

Pahor later wrote about this childhood memory in one of his later novels, &quot;Trg Oberdan&quot; (Oberdan Square), named after the square on which the Slovene Community Hall stood, and also in essays.

He enrolled in an Italian-language Catholic seminary in Koper, and graduated in 1935. He then went to Gorizia to study theology, leaving in 1938. The 1936 Fascist attack on Slovene choirmaster Lojze Bratuž—who was kidnapped, tortured, and killed on Christmas Eve because his choirs continued singing in Slovene—was later referred to by Pahor as confirming his dedication to anti-Fascism and the Slovene ethnic cause, as well as a lifelong intellectual opposition to all totalitarianisms in the name of Christian humanist and communitarian values. Pahor considered himself a pantheist. Although no public and private use of Slovene was allowed and the relations between Slovenes living in Fascist Italy and those from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were forcibly cut off, Pahor nevertheless managed to publish his first short stories in several magazines in Ljubljana (then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) under the pseudonym Jožko Ambrožič, after he began to study standard Slovene during his stay in Capodistria and Gorizia.

In 1939, he established contact with the Slovenian personalist poet and thinker Edvard Kocbek. Kocbek introduced him to contemporary literary trends and helped him improve his use of standard Slovene. In 1938, he returned to Trieste, where he established close contacts with the few Slovene intellectuals who were still working underground in Trieste, including poet Stanko Vuk and some members of the Slovene militant anti-fascist organization TIGR.

==Surviving Nazism and concentration camps==


In 1940, Pahor was drafted into the Italian army and sent to fight in Libya. In 1941, he was transferred to Lombardy, where he worked as a military translator. At the same time, he enrolled at the University of Padua, where he studied Italian literature. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, he returned to Trieste, which had already fallen under Nazi occupation. After a few weeks in the German-occupied city, he decided to join the Slovene Partisans active in the Slovenian Littoral. In 1955, he described these crucial weeks of his life in the novel &quot;Mesto v zalivu&quot; (The City in the Bay), a story about a young Slovene intellectual from Trieste, wondering about what action to take confronted with the highly complex personal and political context of World War II on the border between Italy and Slovenia.

The Littoral Home Guard—a local Slovene anti-communist and anti-Partisan military organization in Slovene Littoral that was directly subordinated to Odilo Globocnik—handed 600 persons suspected of involvement with or sympathy to the resistance over to the Nazis, among them Boris Pahor. The Nazi administration first transported him to Dachau, from which he was relocated to Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (Markirch) and Natzweiler-Struthof in Alsace. From there he was sent back to Dachau, Mittelbau-Dora, Harzungen, and finally to Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated on 15 April 1945. The concentration camp experience became the major inspiration for Pahor&#x27;s work, which has been frequently compared to that of Primo Levi, Imre Kertész, or Jorge Semprún. Between April 1945 and December 1946, Pahor recovered at a French sanatorium in Villers-sur-Marne, Île-de-France.

==Opposing communism==
Pahor returned to Trieste at the end of 1946 when the area was under Allied military administration. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Padua with a bachelor&#x27;s thesis on the poetry of Edvard Kocbek. The same year, he met Kocbek for the first time. The two men were united in their criticism of the communist regime in Yugoslavia and established a close friendship that lasted until Kocbek&#x27;s death in 1981.

In 1951 and 1952, Pahor defended Kocbek&#x27;s literary work against the organized attacks launched by the Slovenian communist establishment and its allies in the Free Territory of Trieste. This resulted in a break with the local leftist circles, with which Pahor had been engaged since 1946. He grew closer to Liberal Democratic positions and in 1966, together with fellow writer from Trieste Alojz Rebula, he founded the journal &quot;Zaliv&quot; (&quot;The Bay&quot;), in which he sought to defend &quot;traditional democratic pluralism&quot; against the totalitarian cultural policies of communist Yugoslavia.

The journal &quot;Zaliv&quot; was published in Slovene in Trieste in Italy outside of reach of communist Yugoslavian authorities. This enabled &quot;Zaliv&quot; to become an important platform for democratic discussion, in which many dissidents from communist Slovenia could publish their opinions. Pahor discontinued the journal in 1990, after the victory of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia in the first free elections in Slovenia after World War II.

Between 1953 and 1975, Pahor worked as an Italian literature instructor in a Slovene-language high school in Trieste. During this time, he was an active member of the international organization AIDLCM (&quot;Association internationale des langues et cultures minoritaires&quot;), which aims to promote minority languages and cultures. In this function, he travelled around Europe discovering the cultural plurality of the continent. This experience strengthened his communitarian and anti-centralist views.

In 1969, Pahor was one of the co-founders of the political party Slovene Left (&quot;Slovenska levica&quot;), established to represent all Slovene leftist voters in Italy who did not agree with the strategy adopted by the Slovene Titoist groups after 1962 of participating in the mainstream Italian political parties (mostly the Communist Party of Italy and the Socialist Party of Italy). The party eventually merged with the Slovene Union. Pahor publicly supported the Slovene Union on several occasions, and ran on its tickets for general and local elections.

In 1975, Pahor and Alojz Rebula published a book in Trieste, entitled &quot;Edvard Kocbek: pričevalec našega časa&quot; (&quot;Edvard Kocbek: Witness to Our Time&quot;) and the 1975 &quot;Zaliv&quot; Scandal followed. Pahor, who lived in Italy and was an Italian citizen, was banned from entering Yugoslavia for several years. He was able to enter Yugoslavia only in 1981 when he was allowed to attend Kocbek&#x27;s funeral. In 1989, his book &quot;Ta ocean strašnó odprt&quot; (&quot;This Ocean, So Terribly Open&quot;) published in Slovenia by the Slovene Society () publishing house, was dedicated to Pahor&#x27;s memories of Kocbek and marked one of the first steps towards the final rehabilitation of Kocbek&#x27;s public image in post-communist Slovenia.

==Later years and recognition==

===Recognition in Slovenia===

After 1990, Pahor gained widespread recognition in Slovenia. He was awarded the Prešeren Award, the highest recognition for cultural achievements in Slovenia, in 1992. In 2008, he was awarded the Gold Order of Freedom. In May 2009, Pahor became a full member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. 

;2010 Documentary film
In 2010, a documentary &quot;Trmasti spomin&quot; (&quot;The Stubborn Memory&quot;) was screened on primetime on the Slovenian National Television Broadcast, featuring several famous public figures who speak about Pahor, including a Slovene philosopher who lives and works in Paris, two Slovene historians from Trieste, Marta Verginella and Jože Pirjevec, Italian writer Claudio Magris from Trieste, French literary critic Antoine Spire, Italian journalist Paolo Rumiz, and Slovene literary historian Miran Košuta from Trieste.

;Honorary Ljubljana Citizen proposal
In 2010, several civil associations proposed him as an honorary citizen of the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana. However, the proposal stalled at the commission for awards of the City Municipality of Ljubljana, who decided not to forward the proposal to the Ljubljana city council for a vote since Pahor publicly refused the idea because the Slovene minority in Italy (1920-1947) was not supported the way it should be during the period of Fascist Italianization, neither by right-wing or by left-wing Slovenian political elites in Ljubljana.

===International recognition===

It was predicted by a Slovene philosopher Evgen Bavčar living in France – Pahor&#x27;s friend whose mother worked in Trieste as Pahor&#x27;s mother did – that as a Slovene writer, Pahor would be recognized by Italian state only after he would be recognized by France and Germany. As explained in the 2010 documentary and in an interview with Pahor that was published in 2013 by &quot;Bukla Magazine&quot;, Italian publishers were not interested in publishing Pahor until French and German translations were published. Only after France and Germany recognized Pahor, his work began to be finally published in Italy in 2007.

In 2008, an influential article entitled Il caso Pahor&quot; (&quot;The Pahor Case&quot;), deploring the fact that the author had remained unknown in Italy for so long and blaming the Italian nationalist milieu of Trieste for it, was published in the Italian journal &quot;La Repubblica&quot;:

In 2008, Pahor was interviewed for the first time by RAI (Italian National Public Television). The interview was aired as part of the &quot;Che tempo che fa&quot;, a primetime Sunday talk show on the Italian public TV&#x27;s third channel.

In 2009, Pahor refused to accept an award by the mayor of Trieste Roberto Dipiazza because the mayor did not mention Italian Fascism alongside Nazism and communism, causing a controversy on the political right in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, resonating in the Italian media. However, support of Pahor&#x27;s decision was voiced by renowned Italian left-wing intellectuals, including the astrophysicist and popular science writer Margherita Hack and the Trieste-based Association of Free and Equal Citizens (&quot;Associazione cittadini liberi ed uguali&quot;), offering an alternative award that would explicitly mention anti-Fascism.

===International awards===

In 2007, Pahor received the French National Order of the Legion of Honour from the French government. In 2009, Pahor was awarded the Cross of Honour for Science and Art by the Austrian government. He was also awarded with the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic of Italy.

===Death===

Pahor died at his home in Contovello/Kontovel, Trieste, Italy on 30 May 2022. He was 108 years old. He was buried in the local Trieste cemetery a week later in June 2022.

==Theatre adaptation==

In 2010, a theatre adaptation of Pahor&#x27;s novel &quot;Necropolis&quot;, directed by the Trieste Slovene director Boris Kobal, was staged in Trieste&#x27;s Teatro Verdi, sponsored by the mayors of Trieste and Ljubljana, respectively Roberto Dipiazza and Zoran Janković.

The event was considered a &quot;historical step&quot; in the normalization of relations between Italians and Slovenes in Trieste, and was attended by numerous Slovenian and Italian dignitaries. After the performance, Pahor declared that he could finally feel himself to be a first-rate citizen of Trieste.

==Literary achievements and influence==
Starting in the 1960s, Pahor&#x27;s work started to become quite well known in Yugoslavia, but it did not gain wide recognition due to opposition from the Slovenian communist regime, which saw Pahor as a potential subversive figure. Nevertheless, he became one of the major moral referents for the new postwar generation of Slovene writers, including Drago Jančar, who has frequently pointed out his indebtedness to Pahor, especially in the essay &quot;The Man Who Said No&quot;, published in 1993 as one of the first comprehensive assessments of Pahor&#x27;s literary and moral role in the postwar era in Slovenia.

Pahor&#x27;s major works include &quot;Vila ob jezeru&quot; (A Villa by the Lake), &quot;Mesto v zalivu&quot; (The City in the Bay), &quot;Nekropola&quot; (Pilgrim among the Shadows), a trilogy about Trieste and the Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947) &quot;Spopad s pomladjo&quot; (A Difficult Spring), &quot;Zatemnitev&quot; (Obscuration), &quot;V labirintu&quot; (In the Labyrinth), and &quot;Zibelka sveta&quot; (The Cradle of the World).

Five of his books have been translated into German.
==Political positions==

Pahor was known for his lifelong defence of ethnic identity as the primary social identification. Pahor defined himself as a &quot;Social Democrat in the Scandinavian sense of the word&quot;. However, he supported different centrist positions, from Christian Democracy and Christian Socialism to more liberal positions. In the late 1980s, he was sceptical of the idea of independent Slovenia, but later supported Jože Pučnik&#x27;s vision of an independent Slovenian welfare state.

In 2007, he publicly supported the candidacy of the Liberal politician Mitja Gaspari for president of Slovenia. In 2009, he ran on the list of the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party as a representative of the Slovene Union for the European Parliament. In 2011, before the Slovenian early elections, he publicly supported the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party.

==Controversies==

In December 2010, Pahor criticized the election of Peter Bossman as the mayor of Piran on the basis of his ethnicity. He stated that it is a &quot;bad sign if one elects a foreigner for mayor.&quot; The statement echoed in the Slovenian and Italian media, and Pahor was accused of racism by some. He rejected these accusations, saying he had nothing against Bossman being black; he clarified his statement by saying that he would rather see a mayor from one of the indigenous ethnic groups from the region, either a Slovene or Istrian Italian.

In March 2012, the Italian right-wing newspaper &quot;Il Giornale&quot; published a book review of his autobiography titled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Son&quot;, in which the book reviewer labels Pahor a &quot;Slovene nationalist&quot; and &quot;negationist&quot; for his agreement with the historian Alessandra Kersevan&#x27;s criticism of historical revisionism in Italy regarding foibe. The book review reproached Pahor for making personal observations about the period of Yugoslav occupation of Trieste (between May and June 1945), implying that he witnessed the events, although he did not reside in the city at the time.

In August 2013, Pahor criticized Giorgio Napolitano and Janez Janša for not explicitly mentioning Italian Fascism alongside German Nazism and Slovenian/Yugoslav communism.

<doc id="999069" wikidata="Q3537582" url="?curid=999069" title="2004 Kazakh legislative election">
<text>Legislative elections were held in Kazakhstan on 19 September and 3 October 2004. The Otan party won 42 of the 77 seats, gaining a majority in the Mäjilis.

==Background==
By 2003 the Kazakh economy was on a recovery with its GDP growth rate being 9.2% which was one of the highest rates among the CIS countries. The primary cause was due to the increased cost of petroleum as a result of the American-led war in Afghanistan, which allowed the government to repay its debts and raise pensions, average salaries and improve medical services. The quality of life in Kazakhstan was improving, as the average monthly salaries increased to about 28,000 Tenge ($198) or about 8.3% increase from 2002. This increase however was not spread evenly. Some groups benefited greatly from the increasing wages, while about 25% of Kazakhs especially in the southwestern districts and regions around the Caspian Sea continued to live below the poverty line.

Despite improvements in the economy and social issues, Kazakhstan faced problems with the lack of independent media, a poor human rights record and the unfair treatment of independent journalists, including the case of Sergei Duvanov who was arrested in October 2002, a few days before his travel to the United States to discuss corruption and the situation with the Kazakh medi, when he was accused of sexually assaulting a minor. Due to international pressure, including from American Secretary of State Colin Powell, Duvanov was released in January 2004.

In the years leading up to the elections, political parties had been significantly weakened. The process of re-registration of parties in spring 2003 particularly affected the opposition due to a law that raised the minimum number of members for parties to be able to register to 50,000. Several opposition parties were unable to meet this requirement.

<text>Palazzo Barbarigo is a palace situated facing the Grand Canal of Venice, Italy. It is not to be confused with the Palazzo Barbarigo Minotto and Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza, both also on the Grand Canal, and other palazzi, and several villas, once owned by the Barbarigo family. 

According to an investigation by the Anti-Corruption Foundation (Russia), the property, together with a part of adjacent palazzo, belongs to Russian conductor Valery Gergiev. It is a small part of the vast inheritance of the philanthropist Yoko Nagae Ceschina, who died in 2015.

==History==
Originally built in the 16th century, it is distinguished by its mosaics of Murano glass applied in 1886. At the time it was owned by the proprietors of one of the glass factories, who were inspired by the exterior mosaics on the facade of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica to apply those to the palace. When the mosaics were installed, the then new owners were decried by their more aristocratic neighbours as &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;, and their taste garish and out of keeping with the genteel decay of the neighbouring buildings. However, it should be remembered that many of the Renaissance palazzi on the canal were once too covered in polychrome and gilt decorations, with elaborate plaster and stucco work.

Later during the 1920s, Palazzo Barbarigo served as the headquarters of Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano, one of the oldest glass factories in Murano. Part of the Palazzo Barbarigo is today a showroom and shop for Murano glass.

The palazzo follows the Renaissance pattern of design on three floors: an open loggia gives access to the canal surmounted by a piano nobile with open loggias and decorated columns, with a &quot;secondo piano nobile&quot; (secondary floor) above. The comparatively modern mosaics probably cover original windows, and obliviate the original design.

<doc id="999111" wikidata="Q3121456" url="?curid=999111" title="Guy Auguste de Rohan-Chabot">
<text>Guy Auguste de Rohan-Chabot known as the &quot;comte de Chabot&quot; (18 August 1683 – 13 September 1760), often referred to as Chevalier de Rohan, was a French nobleman most notable for an altercation with Voltaire.

==Early life==
Guy-Auguste was born on 18 August 1683. He was the son of Louis de Rohan-Chabot, Duc de Rohan, Prince de Leon and Marie Élisabeth du Bec-Crespin de Grimaldi, Marquise de Vardes.

==Altercation with Voltaire==
Guy-Auguste is mostly remembered for an altercation with the young Voltaire in 1725, in which both men insulted each other. He then hired some thugs to assault Voltaire while he watched from his carriage. When Voltaire then exercised his right to demand that Guy-Auguste face him in a duel, the Rohan family obtained a lettre de cachet from French King Louis XV and used this warrant to force Voltaire first into imprisonment in the Bastille and then into exile in Great Britain. Ironically, this exile proved to be of great importance to Voltaire&#x27;s development as a philosopher; his exposure to the more limited constitutional monarchy of England and its emphasis on the protection of civil rights as opposed to the absolute and unrestrained rule of the French kings marked many of his later political writings.

==Personal life==
On 7 February 1729, Guy Auguste married Yvonne Sylvie du Breil de Rays (1712–1740). Before her death on 15 July 1740, he fathered a daughter and two sons:

* Marie Sylvie Alias Charlotte de Rohan-Chabot (1729–1807), who married Jean Baptiste Louis de Clermont d&#x27;Amboise, Marquis de Reynel and Marquis de Montglas.
* &quot;Louis Antoine&quot; Auguste de Rohan-Chabot (1733–1807), who married Élisabeth Louise de La Rochefoucauld. After her death in 1786, he married Adélaïde Suzanne de Vismes, widow of Jean-Benjamin de La Borde and daughter of Pierre-Martin de Vismes and Marie-Louise Legendre, in 1798.
* &quot;Charles&quot; Rosalie de Rohan-Chabot (1740–1813), Count of Jarnac, who married Guyonne Hyacinthe de Pons Saint Maurice, a daughter of Charles Philippe de Pons Saint-Maurice. After her death in 1761, he married Elisabeth Smith.

After his wife&#x27;s death he married Lady Mary Apolonia Scolastica Stafford-Howard (1721–1769) on 25 May 1744. She was the daughter of William Stafford-Howard, 2nd Earl of Stafford, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Baron Stafford.

He died on 13 September 1760 in Paris, France. His son, Louis Antoine, succeeded Guy Auguste&#x27;s father as the Duke of Rohan as did his grandson, Alexandre, Duke of Rohan.

===Descendants===
Through his son Charles Rosalie, he was a grandfather of Adélaïde Louise Guyonne de Rohan-Chabot (1761–1805), also known as Mademoiselle de Jarnac, who was the first wife of Boniface Louis André de Castellane (parents of Marshal of France Boniface de Castellane). After Adélaïde died in 1805, Boniface married her cousin, another of Guy Auguste&#x27;s granddaughters, Alexandrine Charlotte de Rohan-Chabot, widow of Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld, 6th Duke of La Rochefoucauld.

<text>The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra (, &quot;Symphonic Orchestra of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia&quot;) is a symphony orchestra based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Their home venue is the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia.

==History==
The roots of the orchestra date back to 1802, with the founding of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Society that year. The orchestra was initially known as the Imperial Music Choir, and performed for the Court of Alexander III of Russia. By the 1900s, the Orchestra started to give public performances at the Philharmonia and elsewhere in Russia.

After the Russian Revolution, the Orchestra was taken over by the members and the name was changed to the State Philharmonic Orchestra of Petrograd. In the 1920s, the orchestra began receiving support from the State, and began to be known internationally. Its guest conductors included Bruno Walter, Ernest Ansermet, and Hans Knappertsbusch. Following the renaming of Petrograd to Leningrad after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the orchestra was renamed the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra.

The orchestra gained its most fame under the chief conductorship of Yevgeny Mravinsky, from 1938 to 1988. It made few tours to the West, and the first tour was to Finland in the spring of 1946. The orchestra and Mravinsky made a number of studio recordings, and various archival live recordings have since subsequently been commercially released. Under Mravinsky&#x27;s direction, the orchestra premiered seven of Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies.

In 1991, the orchestra was renamed the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Yuri Temirkanov has served as artistic director of the orchestra since 1988, and was its chief conductor from 1988, after the death of Mravinsky, until January 2022. On 21 January 2022, Nikolai Alexeev became chief conductor of the orchestra.

==Chief conductors==
