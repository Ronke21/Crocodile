<text>Apophenia () is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. 

The term ( from the ) was coined by psychiatrist Klaus Conrad in his 1958 publication on the beginning stages of schizophrenia. He defined it as &quot;unmotivated seeing of connections [accompanied by] a specific feeling of abnormal meaningfulness&quot;. He described the early stages of delusional thought as self-referential over-interpretations of actual sensory perceptions, as opposed to hallucinations. 

Apophenia has also come to describe a human propensity to unreasonably seek definite patterns in random information, such as can occur in gambling.

==Introduction==
Apophenia can be considered a commonplace effect of brain function. Taken to an extreme, however, it can be a symptom of psychiatric dysfunction, for example, as a symptom in schizophrenia, where a patient sees hostile patterns (for example, a conspiracy to persecute them) in ordinary actions.

Apophenia is also typical of conspiracy theories, where coincidences may be woven together into an apparent plot.

== Examples ==

=== Pareidolia ===

Pareidolia is a type of apophenia involving the perception of images or sounds in random stimuli.

A common example is the perception of a face within an inanimate object—the headlights and grill of an automobile may appear to be &quot;grinning&quot;. People around the world see the &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;. People sometimes see the face of a religious figure in a piece of toast or in the grain of a piece of wood. There is strong evidence that psychedelic drugs tend to induce or enhance pareidolia.
Pareidolia usually occurs as a result of the fusiform face area—which is the part of the human brain responsible for seeing faces—mistakenly interpreting an object, shape or configuration with some kind of perceived &quot;face-like&quot; features as being a face.

=== Gambling ===
Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers that appear in lotteries, card games, or roulette wheels, where no such patterns exist. A common example of this is the gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

=== Statistics ===
In statistics, apophenia is an example of a type I error – the false identification of patterns in data. It may be compared to a so-called &quot;false positive&quot; in other test situations.

== Related terms ==
In contrast to an epiphany, an apophany (i.e., an instance of apophenia) does not provide insight into the nature of reality nor its interconnectedness, but is a &quot;process of repetitively and monotonously experiencing abnormal meanings in the entire surrounding experiential field&quot;. Such meanings are entirely self-referential, solipsistic, and paranoid—&quot;being observed, spoken about, the object of eavesdropping, followed by strangers&quot;. Thus the English term &quot;apophenia&quot; has a somewhat different meaning from that which Conrad defined when he coined the term .

=== Synchronicity ===
Synchronicity can be considered synonymous with correlation, without any statement about the veracity of various causal inferences.

=== Patternicity ===
In 2008, Michael Shermer coined the word &quot;patternicity&quot;, defining it as &quot;the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise&quot;.

=== Agenticity ===
In &quot;The Believing Brain&quot; (2011), Shermer wrote that humans have &quot;the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency&quot;, which he called &quot;agenticity&quot;.

=== Clustering illusion ===
A clustering illusion is a type of cognitive bias in which a person sees a pattern in a random sequence of numbers or events. Many theories have been disproved as a result of this bias being highlighted.

One case, during the early 2000s, involved the occurrence of breast cancer among employees of ABC Studios in Queensland. A study found that the incidence of breast cancer at the studios was six times the rate in the rest of Queensland. An examination found no correlation between the heightened incidence and any factors related to the site, or any genetic or lifestyle factors of the employees.

== Causes ==
Although there is no confirmed reason as to why apophenia occurs, there are some respected theories.

=== Models of pattern recognition ===
Pattern recognition is a cognitive process that involves retrieving information either from long-term, short-term, or working memory and matching it with information from stimuli. There are three different ways in which this may happen and go wrong, resulting in apophenia.

==== Template matching ====
The stimulus is compared to templates, which are abstracted or partial representations of previously seen stimuli. These templates are stored in long-term memory as a result of past learning or educational experiences. For example, D, d, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, D and d are all recognized as the same letter.

Template-matching detection processes, when applied to more complex data sets (such as, for example, a painting or clusters of data) can result in the wrong template being matched. A false positive detection will result in apophenia.

==== Prototype matching ====
This is similar to template matching, except for the fact that prototypes are complete representations of a stimulus. The prototype need not be something that has been previously seen—for example it might be an average or amalgam of previous stimuli. Crucially, an exact match is not needed.

An example of prototype matching would be to look at an animal such as a tiger and instead of recognizing that it has features that match the definition of a tiger (template matching), recognizing that it&#x27;s similar to a particular mental image one has of a tiger (prototype matching).

This type of pattern recognition can result in apophenia based on the fact that since the brain is not looking for exact matches, it can pick up some characteristics of a match and assume it fits. This is more common with pareidolia than data collection.

==== Feature analysis ====
The stimulus is first broken down into its features and then processed. This model of pattern recognition says that the processing goes through four stages: detection, pattern dissection, feature comparison in memory, and recognition.

=== Evolution ===
One of the explanations put forth by evolutionary psychologists for apophenia is that it is not a flaw in the cognition of human brains but rather something that has come about through years of need. The study of this topic is referred to as error management theory.

One of the most accredited studies in this field is Skinner&#x27;s box. This experiment involved taking a hungry pigeon, placing it in a box and releasing food pellets at random times. The pigeon received a food pellet while performing some action; and so, rather than attributing the arrival of the pellet to randomness, the pigeon repeats that action, and continues to do so until another pellet falls. As the pigeon increases the number of times it performs the action, it gains the impression that it also increased the times it was &quot;rewarded&quot; with a pellet, although the release in fact remained entirely random.

<doc id="984528" wikidata="Q361945" url="?curid=984528" title="Slipway">
<text>A slipway, also known as boat ramp or launch or boat deployer, is a ramp on the shore by which ships or boats can be moved to and from the water. They are used for building and repairing ships and boats, and for launching and retrieving small boats on trailers towed by automobiles and flying boats on their undercarriage.

The nautical terms ways and skids are alternative names for slipway. A ship undergoing construction in a shipyard is said to be &quot;on the ways&quot;. If a ship is scrapped there, she is said to be &quot;broken up in the ways&quot;.

As the word &quot;slip&quot; implies, the ships or boats are moved over the ramp, by way of crane or fork lift. Prior to the move the vessel&#x27;s hull is coated with grease, which then allows the ship or boat to &quot;slip&quot; off the ramp and progress safely into the water. Slipways are used to launch (newly built) large ships, but can only dry-dock or repair smaller ships. 

Pulling large ships against the greased ramp would require too much force. Therefore, for dry-docking large ships, one must use carriages supported by wheels or by roller-pallets. These types of dry-docking installations are called &quot;marine railways&quot;. Nevertheless the words &quot;slip&quot; and &quot;slipway&quot; are also used for all dry-docking installations that use a ramp.

== Simple slipways == 

In its simplest form, a slipway is a plain ramp, typically made of concrete, steel, stone or even wood. The height of the tide can limit the usability of a slip: unless the ramp continues well below the low water level it may not be usable at low tide. Normally there is a flat paved area on the landward end.

When engaged in building or repairing boats or small ships (i.e. ships of no more than about 300 tons), slipways can use a wheeled carriage, or &quot;cradle&quot;,
which is run down the ramp until the vessel can float on or off the carriage. Such slipways are used for repair as well as for putting newly built vessels in the water.

When used for launching and retrieving small boats, the trailer is placed in the water. The boat may be either floated on and off the trailer or pulled off. When recovering the boat from the water, it is winched back up the trailer.

From 1925 onwards, modern whaling factory ships have usually been equipped by their designers with a slipway at the stern
to haul harpooned whales on deck to be processed by flensers.

To achieve a safe launch of some types of land-based lifeboats in bad weather and difficult sea conditions, the lifeboat and slipway are designed so that the lifeboat slides down a relatively steep steel slip under gravity.

== Slipways in ship construction ==
For large ships, slipways are only used in construction of the vessel. They may be arranged parallel or perpendicular to the shore line (or as nearly so as the water and maximum length of vessel allows). On launching, the vessel slides down the slipway on the ways until it floats by itself. The process of transferring the vessel to the water is known as &quot;launching&quot; and is normally a ceremonial and celebratory occasion. It is the point where the vessel is formally named. At this point the hull is complete and the propellers and associated shafting are in place, but dependent on the depth of water, stability and weight the engines might have not been fitted or the superstructure may not be completed.

In a perpendicular slipway, the ship is normally built with its stern facing the water. Modern slipways take the form of a reinforced concrete mat of sufficient strength to support the vessel, with two &quot;barricades&quot; that extend to well below the water level taking into account tidal variations. The barricades support the two launch ways. The vessel is built upon temporary cribbing that is arranged to give access to the hull&#x27;s outer bottom, and to allow the launchways to be erected under the complete hull. When it is time to prepare for launching a pair of standing ways are erected under the hull and out onto the barricades. The surface of these ways are greased (Tallow and whale oil were used as grease in sailing ship days). A pair of sliding ways is placed on top, under the hull, and a launch cradle with bow and stern poppets is erected on these sliding ways. The weight of the hull is then transferred from the build cribbing onto the launch cradle. Provision is made to hold the vessel in place and then release it at the appropriate moment in the launching ceremony, these are either a weak link designed to be cut at a signal or a mechanical trigger controlled by a switch from the ceremonial platform.

Some slipways are built so that the vessel is side on to the water and is launched sideways. This is done where the limitations of the water channel would not allow lengthwise launching, but occupies a much greater length of shore. The &quot;Great Eastern&quot; built by Brunel was built this way as were many landing craft during World War II. This method requires many more sets of ways to support the weight of the ship.

In both cases heavy chains are attached to the ship and the drag effect is used to slow the vessel once afloat until tugboats can move the hull to a jetty for fitting out.

The practice of building on a slipway is dying out with the increasing size of vessels from about the 1970s. Part of the reason is the space requirement for slowing and maneuvering the vessel immediately after it has left the slipway, but the sheer size of the vessel causes design problems, since the hull is basically supported only at its end points during the launch process and this imposes stresses not met during normal operation.

<doc id="984538" wikidata="Q6747674" url="?curid=984538" title="Mancunian Way">
<text>The Mancunian Way is a two mile long grade separated elevated motorway in Manchester, England. It is officially made up of the A57(M) and A635(M) motorways, although the latter does not appear on road signs for practical reasons. It is also part of two other roads: the A57 to the west, which runs east–west through Greater Manchester linking the M602 and M67 motorways, and a short section of non-motorway A635 to the east. Part of this non-motorway section collapsed on 14 August 2015 due to a sinkhole.

==Route==
The road forms a major part of the ManchesterSalford Inner Ring Road and runs south of the city centre. Running eastbound, it starts as a two-lane dual carriageway and passes underneath the A56. Following this, the road widens to three lanes. At the next junction which leads to the A5103, the road reduces to two lanes and becomes an elevated highway. This section runs atop link roads and two roundabouts before reaching the next junction with the A34. At this point the road passes through the centre of the campuses of UMIST (now part of the University of Manchester) and Manchester Metropolitan University. It then runs for around before reaching its junction with the A6 which it crosses on a bridge before dropping down to ground level. It then finishes on the A635 and continues eastbound, and also continues to be called the Mancunian Way.

==History==
===Design===
The Mancunian Way was conceived to form part of the South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire (SELNEC) Highway Plan of 1962, although similar proposals were developed from 1959. A parliamentary bill to authorise the construction of the Mancunian Way was proposed and approved in 1961. During its design it was known as Link Road 17/7. The scheme lies over the geological West Manchester Fault.

It would be the first elevated main road to be built outside London, and the UK&#x27;s second aerial motorway after the Hammersmith flyover. The road is long and has 28 spans of , and two spans of .

The spans are made out of precast concrete, with hollow box-units post-tensioned to form a spine beam. Each of the 105 ft spans is made out of 14 precast concrete hollow box-units 7 ft 3in long. Freyssinet (named after Eugène Freyssinet) multi-strand prestressing cables were threaded through ducts in the box sections. Testing of the design was carried on a 1/12th model at the Research Station of the Cement and Concrete Association at Wexham Springs in South Bucks. The design was made by the consulting engineers G Maunsell &amp; Partners, who had designed the similar Hammersmith flyover in 1961. The company was known for prestressed concrete flyovers. The design received a Concrete Society award.

The designer of the bridges would go on to design the Westway dual carriageway in London, which opened as the A40(M) in July 1970, losing its motorway status in 2000.

===Construction===

The construction was carried out in two phases: the first stage involved the construction of a dual carriageway of to the east of the A6 road in November 1963 and was opened to traffic as part of the A635 road in November 1965.

The second stage was the construction, from December 1964, of a long elevated highway of a motorway standard which ran between the A6 and A56 roads. The second stage was open to traffic as part of the A57 road in March 1967. The previous day it was opened to pedestrians, who were allowed to walk the whole of the high-level route as a sight-seeing publicity exercise. Many people brought picnics which they ate in the centre of the carriageway.

At that time, the construction specifications had included cosmetic fairings to the tops of the support piers. These completely enclosed the roller bearings upon which the elevated roadway sits. However, the first time these bearings were serviced, the fairings were removed and never replaced. This leaves the poorer appearance seen today and also allows the ingress of dirt to the bearings.

Leonard Fairclough &amp; Son were the contractors, and the prestressed concrete sections were made at its operations in Adlington, Lancashire. The contractor&#x27;s site compound was in Loxford Street. The piling was completed by Pigott Foundations of Ormskirk with auger (screw) boring with reinforcement cages. The piling went deep through the boulder clay to the Bunter sandstone (Buntsandstein). The road on the structure and kerbing was built by Wilson and Wilkinson of Worsley in Salford.

===Opening===
The Mancunian Way was officially opened by Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, on 5 May 1967. In the 1970s, it was upgraded to motorway status as the A57(M) and the speed limit was raised to . At the time of its opening the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; referred to it as the &quot;highway in the sky&quot;. The scheme cost was £5.5million (£million in today&#x27;s figures).

===Extension as the A635(M)===
In 1992, the westbound junction was rebuilt to replace a temporary flyover, whereby the A56 passed over a roundabout where the A57(M) originally ended. At the same time, a new flyover was built at the eastern end, over the A6, but was legally designated as the A635(M) in 1995.

===Oddities===
Just before the junction with the A34 is an unfinished slip road (stub) that ends 20 feet in the air, although development next to Mancuian Way has meant much of the stub was demolished in October 2018.

The last of the Mancunian Way in the east is part of the A635, the A57 heading south east from the same junction as the A6, though it states A57(M) on the signage as one enters westbound. Department for Transport documentation states differently, so officially the Mancunian Way consists of two motorways, the A57(M) and the A635(M).

Part of the easternmost non-motorway section of Mancunian Way collapsed into a sinkhole on 14 August 2015, after almost half a month&#x27;s worth of rain fell in parts of Manchester in just six hours. The closure caused significant congestion on the remaining part of Mancunian Way and other nearby roads. It fully reopened on 15 June 2016 after 10 months of repair work.

==Cultural references==
*The scene in which Sam Tyler wakes up in 1973 in s1e1 of Life on Mars takes place in a planned construction site for the Mancunian Way, despite that it was already built by then. As he runs out of the site, a billboard is shown with the words &quot;Coming Soon! Manchester&#x27;s Highway in the Sky&quot;.
*In 1985, British composer Arthur Butterworth composed a march for large wind band entitled &#x27;Mancunian Way&#x27; (op. 66)&#x27;.
*The 2006 Take That album &quot;Beautiful World&quot; includes a track entitled &quot;Mancunian Way&quot;, which is about the city of Manchester and the local vicinity and notable events. The group was formed in Manchester and three of the five original members are from the Greater Manchester area.

<text>Ernestine Hill (born Mary Ernestine Hemmings, 21 January 1899 — 21 August 1972) was an Australian journalist, travel writer and novelist. Known for her various travels across Australia and her writings about the diverse landscapes and cultures in the country, she published books such as &quot;The Great Australian Loneliness&quot; in 1937 and &quot;The Territory&quot; in 1951. She also wrote a novel, &quot;My Love Must Wait&quot;, published in 1941.

==Life==
Born Mary Ernestine Hemmings in Rockhampton, Queensland, she was the daughter of Robert Hemmings and Margaret &quot;Magde&quot; Foster-Lyman and they spent much of her early life moving up and down the coast, from Mackay to Thursday Island as they both had mobile professions; she was their only child.

Hill first attended school at a Catholic state school in Townsville before, following winning a bursary in the Queensland State School examination she was able to attend the more prestigious All Hallows&#x27; School in Brisbane as a boarder from 1910. Her father passed away in the same year. 

While attending All Hallows&#x27;, around 1914, Hill published her first poem in The Catholic Advocate and became a regular contributor to its children&#x27;s page. In 1916 her poems where published as a volume, &quot;Peter Pan Land&quot;, and she was called a &#x27;Queensland girl poet par excellence&#x27; and a &#x27;genius unspoiled&#x27;. The proceeds from its sale were set aside to fund her studies in additional to her existing scholarship. 

Following the completion of her schooling there she attended Stott &amp; Hoare&#x27;s Business College, Brisbane where she gained high passes in shorthand and typing skills. On completing her studies, she worked briefly in the public service (as a typist at the Department of Justice Library), and then for Smith&#x27;s Weekly, Sydney, first as the secretary to the literary editor, J. F. Archibald, and later as a journalist and subeditor.

On 30 October 1924 her son Robert was born. Rumoured to be Robert Clyde Packer&#x27;s son, who she met in her role at Smith&#x27;s Weekly which he founded, although this has never been publicly acknowledged. Ernestine assumed the surname Hill after the birth to protect herself saying that her husband, Mr Hill, was either overseas or dead. Following Robert&#x27;s birth she took a role with The Examiner (Tasmania) with family, including Hills mother, caring for him; this would continue for most of his young life and Hill had little choice but to do so as a single woman.

During the 1930s she travelled extensively around Australia, writing as she went, primarily for Associated Newspapers and she is recorded as having travelled to places such as the East Kimberley (a record of &#x27;Mrs Hill&#x27; appears in an October 1930 diary entry of Michael Durack) and Port Hedland; Hill recalled of this time that many of the people she met during this period were: &quot;unaccustomed to the ways of the new woman and deceived by my outback shirt and trousers&quot;; she was often mistaken for a man. The articles she produced appeared in the Sydney Sun and syndicated to other major city newspapers. She also regularly published pictorial essays in Walkabout (magazine) and amassed a collection of over three thousand photographs in which she documenting the landscape and her encounters with Aboriginal people. 

In 1931 her sensationalist reporting of the discovery of gold in The Granites, north-west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, contributed to a gold rush and a stock-market boom. This rush resulted in a major failure which left many prospectors stranded and destitute, and Hill was attacked for irresponsible journalism. This story is told, in detail, in &quot;Tragedy track: the story of The Granites&quot; by FE Baume (1933).

It is also during this period that Hill first formed a relationship with Daisy Bates, who she first camped with a Ooldea, South Australia in June 1932; their relationship became an ongoing one throughout the remainder of Bates&#x27; life. Together the produced a syndicated series of articles entitled &quot;&#x27;My Natives and I&quot;&#x27;, first published in The Advertiser (Adelaide) in 1936. They worked together closely and Hill later claimed to be mostly responsible as a ghost-writer for Bates&#x27; &quot;The Passing of the Aborigines&quot;, although this is a contentious issue. claims that Bates eventually confirmed that Hill did ghost-write the book.

Hill then stopped travelling and worked for the ABC from 1940 from 1944, first as the editor of the ABC Weekly&#x27;s women&#x27;s pages (1940-1942) and then held the position of commissioner (1941-1944). Hill and her son were both pacifists and much of this war period was spent attempting to help Robert, who had already been conscripted, avoid war service. She lobbied directly to John Curtin for his conscription to be deferred as he was of invaluable assistance to her research and that her work was of &#x27;outstanding value to Australia&#x27;. She also wrote to H. V. Evatt, the then Attorney-General of Australia, asking him to intervene. Despite their efforts Robert was ultimately forced to the Cowra recruit camp in May 1944 but was shortly after discharged as &#x27;mentally unfit&#x27; in October 1944.

After resigning from the ABC, she resumed her travels, now with her son Robert by her side as a research assistant, but published little from her work during this period. The pair lived together as travellers in a caravan for many years. 

She was awarded a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship in 1959. However, while this provided her with a small pension, her final years were characterised by financial and health problems and, in 1970, she returned to Brisbane to be cared for by her family and died in their care in 1972.

==Legacy==
The majority of her writing, which comprised books as well as articles for newspapers and such journals as &quot;Walkabout&quot;, resulted from her wide travels across Australia. They recorded her adventures and focus on the Australian landscape. She could also be controversial. 

She is best known for &quot;The Territory&quot; (1951). However, her only novel, &quot;My Love Must Wait (&quot;1941), a fictionalised biography of sailor and navigator Matthew Flinders, sold well overseas as well as in Australia.

Hill&#x27;s portrait, painted in 1970 by Sam Fullbrook, is in the Queensland Art Gallery an image of this portrait is available through the National Archives of Australia.

<doc id="984544" wikidata="Q2400750" url="?curid=984544" title="Linguasphere Observatory">
<text>The Linguasphere Observatory (or the Observatoire, based on its original French and legal title: &quot;Observatoire Linguistique&quot;) is a non-profit transnational research network, devoted (alongside related programs) to the gathering, study, classification, editing and free distribution online of the updatable text (initially in English) of a fully indexed and comprehensive &quot;Linguasphere Register of the World&#x27;s Languages and Speech Communities.&quot;

==History==
The Observatoire was created in Quebec in 1983 and was subsequently established and registered in Normandy as a non-profit association under the honorary presidency of the late Léopold Sédar Senghor, a French-language poet and the first president of Senegal. Its founding director is David Dalby, former director of the International African Institute and emeritus reader in the University of London, and its first research secretary was Philippe Blanchet, a Provençal-language poet currently serving as Professor of Sociolinguistics at the University of Rennes. Since 2010, the deputy director and webmaster of the Observatoire has been Pierrick le Feuvre, with the chairman of its research council being Roland Breton, emeritus professor at the University of Paris VIII. The Observatoire&#x27;s research hub is currently based in the preserved county of Dyfed, Wales and, in the European Union, in Normandy, France. Its title in Welsh is Wylfa Ieithoedd, literally the &quot;Observatory (of) languages&quot;, together with its publishing program (in Cymraeg or &quot;Welsh&quot; = cy. Gwasg y Byd Iaith, i.e. &quot;Press (of) the World (of) Language&quot;).

The Observatoire has developed an innovative scheme of philological classification, coding all living and recorded languages within a global referential framework or &quot;linguascale&quot;. This Linguascale Framework uses a decimal structure (see below) to record both genetic and geographic categories of relationship (termed &quot;phylozones&quot; and &quot;geozones&quot;, respectively).

In 1999/2000, the Observatoire published its first 2-volume &quot;Linguasphere Register of the World&#x27;s Languages and Speech Communities&quot;. Reviews were published by Edward J. Vajda in &quot;Language&quot; and by Anthony P. Grant in &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Society&quot;.

The Observatoire has now prepared a revised edition of the Linguasphere Register from 2010, the first of a projected series of regular updates at 10-year intervals. The current edition (LS-2010), comprising substantial materials from the foundation edition of 2000, is published online from 2011 as a freely available public resource and an online data-base, compiled and co-ordinated by David Dalby and Pierrick le Feuvre. Provision is made for the online gathering of additional and improved data, and for the open discussion of proposals and criticisms.

From 2001 until December 2005, the Linguasphere Observatory was actively involved in collaboration with the British Standards Institution BSI Group and with ISO/TC 37in the design and development of a four-letter (alpha-4) code covering—potentially—every recorded language variety in the world. The Observatoire was not, however, associated with or responsible for the final ISO 639-6 standard which was a partial result of this collaboration, approved and published by ISO in 2009. It is the policy of the Observatoire that its on-going independent work on language coding should also be complementary to and supportive of the ISO 639 international standards,

The Observatoire expresses its praise and gratitude to the parallel pioneering work of Barbara Grimes, with her husband Joseph, in her position - based in Hawaii until her retirement from 1996 - as the creative Editor of the Summer Institute of Linguistics&#x27; &quot;Ethnologue: Languages of the World.&quot;

==The Linguasphere Register and Linguascale referential framework==
The &quot;Linguascale&quot; framework is a referential system covering all languages, as published in the &quot;Linguasphere Register&quot; in 2000 and subsequently refined in 2010. It comprises a flexible coding formula which seeks to situate each language and dialect within the totality of the world&#x27;s living and recorded languages, having regard to ongoing linguistic research.

The first part of this linguascale is the decimal classification referred to above, consisting of a &quot;linguasphere key&quot; of two numerals denoting the relevant phylozone or geozone: from codice_1. to codice_2. This provides a systematic numerical key for the initial classification of any of the world&#x27;s languages, following the principles set out in the &quot;Linguasphere Register&quot;. The first numeral of the key represents one of the ten referential &quot;sectors&quot; into which the world&#x27;s languages are initially divided. The sector can either be a &quot;phylosector&quot;, in which the constituent languages are considered to be in a diachronic relationship one with another, or a &quot;geosector&quot;, in which languages are grouped geographically rather than historically.

The second numeral is used to represent the ten &quot;zones&quot; into which each geosector is divided for referential purposes. The component zones, like the sectors, are described as either &quot;phylozones&quot; or &quot;geozones&quot;, based on the nature of the relationship among their constituent languages: either historical or geographical.

The second part of the linguascale consists of three capital letters (majuscules): from codice_3 to codice_4. Each zone is divided into one or more &quot;sets&quot;, with each set being represented by the first majuscule of this three-letter (alpha-3) component. Each set is divided into one or more &quot;chains&quot; (represented by the second majuscule) and each chain is into one or more &quot;nets&quot; (represented by the third majuscule). The division of the languages of a zone into sets, chains and nets is based on relative degrees of linguistic proximity, as measured in principle by approximate proportions of shared basic vocabulary. Geozones are on average divided into more sets than phylozones because relationships among languages within the latter are by definition more obvious and much closer.

The third and final part of the linguascale consists of up to three lowercase letters (minuscules), used to identify a language or dialect with precision: from codice_5 to codice_6. The first letter of this sequence represents an &quot;outer unit&quot; (preferred from 2010 to the original term of &quot;outer language&quot;, to avoid the shifting and often emotive applications of the terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot;). The &quot;inner units&quot; and language varieties that may comprise any outer unit are coded using a second, and wherever necessary a third minuscule letter.

===Examples===
The application of the linguascale may be illustrated with the concrete examples below, chosen from within the English language.

For example,
* The code covering all forms of English is codice_7, where codice_8 represents the Indo-European phylosector, codice_9 represents the Germanic phylozone, codice_10 represents the &quot;Norsk+ Frysk set&quot; (a compound-name chosen to cover the contents of the Germanic phylozone), codice_11 represents the &quot;English+ Anglo-Creole chain&quot;, and codice_7 is the &quot;English net&quot;. Within this net, the outer units are:
** codice_13 – Scots+ Northumbrian.
** codice_14 – &quot;Anglo-English&quot; (the traditional localised varieties of southern Great Britain and also Ireland).
** codice_15 – Global English (varieties of modern English as spoken and written around the world).
* Some more specific examples of English varieties are:
** codice_16 is the Geordie traditional variety: belonging to codice_13 Scots+ Northumbrian outer language, and codice_18 Northumbrian.
** codice_19 is the Norfolk traditional variety: belonging to codice_14 &quot;Anglo-English&quot; outer unit, and specifically to codice_21 Southern (British) traditional English.
** codice_22 covers the range of (non-creolised) Nigerian English : belonging to codice_15 Global English outer unit, and codice_24 West-African English. Nigerian English is thus distinguished from the often overlapping codice_25 Enpi (or &quot;NP&quot;, from the abbreviation of so-called &quot;Nigerian Pijin&quot;): belonging to codice_26 Anglo-Creole net, and codice_27 Wes-kos (West Coast Anglo-Creole).

===Languages of London===
A practical application of the &quot;Linguasphere Register&quot; and its linguascale in the study of a complex urban linguistic environment has been as the referential framework for successive surveys of over 200 languages other than English spoken by plurilingual children at state schools in London (representing just under 40% of the total number of children attending), as edited in 2000 by Baker and Eversley and in 2010 by Eversley et al.

==&quot;Langues de la Liberté/Languages of Liberty&quot;==
In Paris, from 1987, the Observatoire linguistique created a bilingual exhibition &quot;Langues de la Liberté / Languages of Liberty&quot;, tracing the transnational development of certain basic concepts of personal freedom through the interaction of English and French, rather than by the action of any one nation. At the outset of a series of 34 illustrated triptychs, attention was drawn to the historical role of other transnational languages in the development of such concepts, including Greek and German.

The exhibition was sponsored by the government of a bilingual nation, Canada, by the international francophone Agence (ACCT) and by the region of Haute-Normandie. It was inaugurated in Paris at the Centre Georges Pompidou on 6 June 1989, and presented there throughout the summer of 1989 as the official Canadian contribution to the bicentenary celebrations of the French Revolution.

At the subsequent presentation of this bilingual exhibition at the Hôtel de Région in Rouen (Haute-Normandie), from 23 September to 21 October 1989, the Observatoire linguistique organised the first public display of the only surviving contemporary copy of the vernacular (and arguably pre-Latin) text of England&#x27;s &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, written in 13th century French.

Thanks to continued support from Canada, the exhibition was subsequently presented by the Observatoire in Belgium and England, at the Palais des Congrès in Liège and at the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1990, and finally in Australia, at Old Parliament House, Canberra in May 1991.

In the context of the need to design a plurilingual framework of ethics for a future planetary society, the Observatoire has announced its intention to return to the transnational theme of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; in 2015, on the occasion of the 8th centenary of the signing of its formal Latin version at Runnymede in 2020.

== &quot;In the galaxy of languages, each person&#x27;s voice is a star&quot; ==
The motto of the Observatoire linguistique dates from 1990—in French: &quot;Dans la galaxie des langues, la voix de chaque personne est une étoile&quot; (translated into English as above).

The Observatoire adopted these words as its guiding philosophy on the occasion of the first series of debates organised by the Observatoire linguistique in 1990–1991, at Fleury-sur-Andelle in Haute-Normandie, at Maillane in Provence and at Huy in Wallonie, sponsored by each of the relevant regions, on the subject of &quot;Nos langues et l&#x27;unité de l&#x27;Europe&quot; (&quot;Our languages and the unity of Europe&quot;). The guest of honour at the first of these debates was André Martinet (1908–1999), doyen of trans-Atlantic linguistics.

From the year 2000 UNESCO adopted and adapted the Observatoire&#x27;s motto in the form: &quot;In the galaxy of languages, each word is a star&quot;.

<doc id="984547" wikidata="Q15177570" url="?curid=984547" title="A580 road">
<text>The A580 (officially the Liverpool–East Lancashire Road, colloquially the East Lancs) is the United Kingdom&#x27;s first purpose-built A road. The road was officially opened by King George V on 18 July 1934. Despite its name, the actual road runs through the modern day metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester which were historically in Lancashire when the road was built until 1974. Notable towns and cities along the route include Liverpool, Kirkby, St. Helens, Leigh, Swinton and Salford. It was described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s biggest road&quot; at the time.

==Purpose==
The road was built to provide better access between the Port of Liverpool and the industrial areas of East Lancashire around Manchester. The new high-quality trunk road would supersede the indirect and heavily built-up A57 through Prescot, Warrington and Eccles. Journey times for road haulage would be reduced to under an hour.

This road was built with a 1930s Dutch-style cycle path running its entire length. Many roads at this time were built with cycle paths but most have been lost due to road widening schemes.

==History==
===First phase (completed)===
The first part, which was completed within three years, was from Walton, Liverpool, to the junction with the A6 at Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height in Salford. The road was constructed in an almost straight alignment with few curves.

To be a high-speed trunk route, its 1930s planners designed some parts to be three roads in one. The central section was exclusively for through traffic while adjacent side roads – either side of the main carriageway – provided local access. Although the sections within Liverpool were dual carriageway from the beginning, a few short stretches through Salford continue to use the original three-lane layout. The rest of the road was converted to dual with a central reservation in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the original 1930s bridges remain; they were built from steel in preparation for any future expansion as they would be easier to replace than ones constructed from moulded concrete.

The road remains the UK&#x27;s largest pre-motorway project. In 2004 the Highways Agency detrunked the road, passing control and maintenance over to the local authorities along its route.

===Second phase (never developed)===
With the completion of the first phase, the next stage was to extend the road beyond Salford and into East Lancashire proper. However this was never undertaken. Its failure was largely due to the road&#x27;s location. Despite linking North West England&#x27;s largest cities, the East Lancs remained isolated from the rest of the UK&#x27;s national road network. Both ends of the highway began in high-density urban areas that were not close to any comparable infrastructure that could assist rapid transit connections.

By 1942, proposals were put forward to extend the A580 across the Pennines to Hull on the east coast of Britain. Although this plan never came to fruition, its purpose became the foundation for the construction of the M62 motorway in 1960.

<doc id="984557" wikidata="Q6813116" url="?curid=984557" title="Melling, Merseyside">
<text>Melling is a village and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside, England. At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 2,810, rising to 3,493 at the 2011 Census.
Melling Rock contains a public house as well as &quot;St Thomas and the Holy Rood&quot;. The town of Waddicar, of which most of the population of Melling consists, is usually regarded as part of Melling itself and is served by the parish council which is based in the local Melling Primary School.

==Etymology==
Historically a part of Lancashire, its name originates from the Anglo-Saxon roots for &quot;the homestead of Maella&quot; (or Malla). Lying close to Liverpool, the area was settled by Maella&#x27;s family in the 6th century. &quot;Melling&quot; may also be derived from the Brittonic &quot;mę:l&quot; meaning &quot;bald, bare&quot;. The village was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Melinge&quot;.

==History==
A &#x27;headless cross&#x27; is located in the parish church. During surveys undertaken as part of the construction of the M57 motorway, a number of anomalies were found which were concluded as being the remains of a Stone Age settlement based around Melling Rock. It is also noted that the local Wood House Farm was the location of a very minor battle during the English Civil War which was concluded from a number of cannonballs dating from the era along with Melling House, which is shown to have been seriously damaged as a result of such action, evidence of which can be found at ground level where remains of a now-destroyed defensive wall can be seen.

==Community==
The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes the village, and during the years of the Industrial Revolution the village flourished through passing trade. Melling is near the Aintree Grand National racecourse, which then crosses Melling Road (which actually runs from Walton to Aintree and does not go to Melling) soon after the start. There is also a Melling Steeplechase at the Grand National meeting. The local Melling Tithebarn Arts Association is based in Melling Tithebarn, which is used as an event venue. The old tithe barn serves as St Thomas&#x27; Church Hall as well as a local community centre. The Melling Residents&#x27; and Community Association (MRCA) dates from the 1930s. Originally used by the Lords of the Manor of Melling, the Molyneux, and later a builders&#x27; shed, it was given to the people of the village. The village has changed dramatically since the late 1990s with the demolition of the cable factory and the recent construction of a modern housing estate which is located in Waddicar, backing onto the Leeds-Liverpool canal.

==Places of worship==
The parish church is a grade II listed building built in 1834 to replace an earlier chapel, and is dedicated to St Thomas and the Holy Rood. It is a part of the Maghull and Melling Team and the Diocese of Liverpool. 

The catholic church of the Most Holy Redeemer and St Kentigern was built in 1900 and is dedicated to Kentigern, patron saint of Glasgow, to reflect the origins of many of its original parishioners. 

==Transport==
There are no railway stations serving Melling, the nearest station is Maghull serving the town of Maghull by frequent electric services from Ormskirk to Liverpool, or Kirkby, serving the nearby district of Kirkby by services from Headbolt Lane to Liverpool.

==Notable residents==
* Will Sergeant, lead guitarist of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen grew up here.
* Paul Rooney (artist), visual and sound artist, grew up here.
*Connor Randall Professional Footballer, Attended local school and grew up here.

<text>This is an alphabetical listing of cities and countries that have commuter or suburban railways that are currently operational and in service. Commuter and suburban rail systems are train services that connect city centres with outer suburbs or nearby cities, with most passengers traveling for work or school. Unlike metros or light rail these systems usually operate on main line tracks unsegregated from other rail traffic. They differ from regional rail in that they usually have a hub-and-spoke paradigm and are focused on moving large number of passengers to a central business district.

<doc id="984567" wikidata="Q1056864" url="?curid=984567" title="Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa">
<text>The Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa () is a football stadium in Leiria, Portugal, built as a venue for the UEFA Euro 2004 finals held in Portugal. It is the home for Leiria&#x27;s main football club, União de Leiria. It was designed by Tomás Taveira in 2003. The stadium contains different coloured seats as well as an athletics track and has a capacity of 23,888 seats.

The stadium has hosted the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira (the Portuguese Super Cup) in 2006 and 2007 and the final of the league cup Taça da Liga in 2014 and from 2021 to 2025.

==Games held==
During the UEFA Euro 2004 finals, the stadium hosted Croatia&#x27;s matches against Switzerland in a 0–0 draw and France in a 2–2 draw in Group B.

It also hosted the 2006 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira where Porto defeated Vitória de Setúbal 3–0 with goals from Anderson, Adriano and Vieirinha. The following year, in 2007, it again played host to the Supertaça, but this time Sporting CP won the title over Porto by a score of 1–0.

In 2021 and 2022, the stadium was host to the finals of the Taça da Liga in which Sporting CP won their third and fourth title in the competition.

== Design ==
The Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa intends to complement its surrounding territory with a part of the stadium that opens towards the scenery and another part that shows the defence wall of a medieval castle dominating the city. The project, created by architect Tomás Taveira, consists of continuous tiers that run a wavy course. The tiers are highest at the main stands (in the center of the stadium) and gently wind down in correspondence with the south stand behind one of the goals. This leaves an opening towards the city, the woods and the castle that overlooks the stadium.

The roof follows the course of the tiers which are placed according to an elliptical framework that is brusquely interrupted at the north stand. The north stand contained a temporary and uncovered tribune that ran parallel to one of the playing field&#x27;s short sides.

The seats are of different colours, placed randomly. The use of different tint colours characterizes the entire stadium. The roof is constructed with a transparent material that has external light filtered which makes the yellow colour of the metallic structure stand out. The roof appears to float on the tiers; it is, however, hanging on steel tie-beams (in blue) and tall pennons (in red) that are only located above the main tribunes. The external perimeter is characterized by squared panels of lively tints placed on a natural white background separated by the red metallic pillars.

The well-balanced use of different colours is also evident throughout the stadium. Five levels consisting of several internal rooms provide numerous services to the audience such as restaurants and commercial activities. The stadium serves as a multi-functional building where sports of every kind can be played, including track and field, and also were music concerts are held often providing a wonderful scenery and a colourful background.

==Portugal national team==
The following Portugal national football team matches were held in the stadium.

<doc id="984586" wikidata="Q7330949" url="?curid=984586" title="Richmond Progressive Alliance">
<text>The Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) is a progressive political group in Richmond and western Contra Costa County, California, United States. RPA formed in 2003 by local progressives.

RPA is an umbrella organization for progressives and leftists, regardless of political party. RPA members include voters registered as Democrats, Greens, and Independents. Similarly, RPA electeds include Democrats, Greens, and Independents.

RPA mostly focuses on local elections. RPA routinely wins seats on the Richmond City Council. Richmond has non-partisan elections, which helps groups like RPA win and wield power. This is similar to Progressive Dane. Richmond also elected all city council seats on a top-3 city-wide basis, which empowered RPA. In 2020, Richmond adopted single-member districts for its city council. In 2024, Richmond&#x27;s mayor and city council voted to send a ranked-choice (instant-runoff) voting measure to voters.

RPA supports higher taxes and lower pollution for the local Chevron refinery; opposition to racial profiling; and opposition to urban casino development in Point Molate. During the 2000s and 2010s, the alliance altered the balance of power in the city and reduced the representation of Chevron-backed candidates. RPA increased school funding, ended cooperation with ICE for non-criminals, and enacted Ban the Box. While RPA has been in power, Richmond saw a 75% decrease in homicide. Taxes on Chevron, supported by RPA, amounted to $204 million, which RPA invested in social programs.

Notable members include Gayle McLaughlin and Jovanka Beckles.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 2003 or 2004, an &quot;unlikely group of Greens, Latinos, progressive Democrats, African Americans, and free spirits&quot; founded RPA. Co-founders included Gayle McLaughlin, Marilyn Langlois, and Andrés Soto. McLaughlin cited Peter Camejo&#x27;s run in 2002 as Green Party candidate for Governor of California as their inspiration for getting involved in politics.

=== 2000s ===
In 2004, RPA member Gayle McLaughlin, a Green and a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) member, won a city council seat in Richmond. They were the first RPA member to do so.

In 2005, RPA supported transfer of the former Zeneca site at Campus Bay to the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.
In the 2006 Richmond, California municipal elections, Gayle McLaughlin won the election for mayor against incumbent Democrat Irma Anderson. This made Richmond the largest city in the United States to have a Green mayor.

In 2008, RPA supported ballot measure Measure T which would substantially increased business license fees for large corporations like Chevron, owner of the Chevron Richmond Refinery. RPA opposed, Measure U, which would enable casino building, like the one proposed for the former Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot, was successfully defeated at the ballot box.

After the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Richmond saw extensive foreclosures. In 2008, Richmond began fining banks $1000 per day if they failed to maintain their property, and had collected $1.5 million by 2014. In 2014, RPA and McLaughlin supported an underwater mortgage bailout program which would use eminent domain to obtain better terms for underwater homeowners; however, banks threatened a capital strike and Congress passed a law banning the practice.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, RPA negotiated with Chevron to contribute millions of dollars for the city to reinvest in itself instead of facing Measure T which would have forced a change in the utility tax which would have made them potentially contribute more.

In 2012, RPA member Jeff Ritterman proposed Measure N, a tax on sugary drinks. Community Coalition Against Beverage Taxes, funded by the American Beverage Association, spent $2.4 million to defeat it. It was rejected by 66.9% of voters.

In 2014, Richmond municipal elections attracted national media attention, as they were seen as a &quot;David versus Goliath&quot; race in the wake of the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court case. Chevron spent about $3.1 million to support its own slate of candidates and break progressive control of the council, which was more than Chevron had spent in total on all US Congress races from 2008 to 2012. According to McLaughlin, Chevron &quot;bought up every billboard in town&quot;. In the mayoral election, RPA endorsed Mike Parker for Richmond mayor. However, Parker withdrew from the race in August and endorsed Tom Butt, in order to avoid splitting the left and center-left vote. Butt beat Chevron&#x27;s mayoral candidate, Nat Bates, with more than 51 percent of the election and avoiding a run-off. In the city council election, RPA took all 3 open seats, with McLaughlin, Martinez, and Beckles beating out Chevon-backed candidates Donna Powers, Charles Ramsey, and Al Martinez.

In 2016, RPA won 2 additional city council seats, giving them 5 of 6 city council seats and 5 of 7 voting seats in the Richmond government. Richmond voters approved a controversial rent-control and just-cause eviction measure written and backed by the RPA. RPA&#x27;s rent control measure passed, which soured relations between RPA and mayor Butt, who opposed the measure.

In 2017, RPA endorsed three members for McLaughlin&#x27;s empty seat, including Langlois and Ada Recinos. In a surprising decision, the council picked Recinos over Langlois.

In 2018, McLaughlin created the California Progressive Alliance, a statewide offshoot of the RPA which endorses progressive candidates for state and federal elections. McLaughlin ran for Lieutenant Governor of California, but lost.

In the same year, RPA member Jovanka Beckles and former Obama 2008 campaign coordinator Buffy Wicks competed for the California Assembly District 15 seat. Richmond mayor Tom Butt and the California Progressive Alliance endorsed Wicks. Wicks went on to beat Beckles by 12 points and win the seat.

In 2019, Butt blamed the Richmond Progressive Alliance for obstructing appointments to city positions, which are done typically at the prerogative of the mayor.

By 1994, Joyner appeared in news reports regarding his participation in plans to build a biblical theme park, in particular, with Reggie White, who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to purchase the Heritage USA theme park property.

The ministry hosts multiple conferences annually, with Christians from across the country and globe attending.

In 1997 Joyner purchased 320 acres of land in Wilkes County, North Carolina, near Moravian Falls and moved the headquarters of MorningStar there from Charlotte.

In 2004 MorningStar purchased part of the Heritage USA complex (originally established by Jim Bakker and PTL in Fort Mill, South Carolina) for $1.6 million. The complex has been renamed Heritage International Ministries Conference Center. Joyner also promotes the Kingdom Business Association which is located in the same complex.

Christ&#x27;s Mandate for Missions (CMM) merged with MorningStar Missions in 2009.

==Advisory and other leadership roles==
Joyner has been a part of the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement and an advocate for the Fivefold ministry and has been considered a leader in the movement since he published &quot;The Harvest&quot; in 1989, in which he predicted there would soon be a prophetic movement and a separate apostolic movement.
In the mid-1990s Joyner was one of the all-male members of the international advisors-at-large to the evangelical Christian women&#x27;s organization Aglow International.

Joyner is also the founder and president of the Oak Initiative. The non-profit organization is for Christians who desire &quot;to Unite, Mobilize, Equip, and Activate Christians to be the salt and light they are called to be by engaging in the great issues of our time from a sound biblical worldview.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 1998 Joyner&#x27;s MorningStar Ministries was grossing $7 million a year, and that year it was denied a religious property tax exemption by the North Carolina Department of Revenue for an airplane, four tracts of vacant land, and two residential houses — one that Joyner lived in and one where Don Potter lived and had a recording studio. Department director John C. Bailey said, &quot;[w]ith MorningStar there are a lot of tracts with costly improvements that affect tax liability significantly... If we did not limit exemptions, it would increase the burden on people, like you and me, who own homes that are not affiliated with any group.&quot; MorningStar appealed the Department of Revenue&#x27;s denial. Also, Joyner&#x27;s MorningStar Fellowship Church filed a $20 million lawsuit against York County, South Carolina, over the unfinished 21-story hotel on their property that Jim Bakker had started in the 1980s. MSFC filed an appeal of Judge Hall&#x27;s ruling that &quot;MorningStar has not provided substantial evidence to back up its claims.&quot; The building has never been finished and the county found the church in default after they missed a deadline to show their ability to fund the project.

Controversy has also accompanied Joyner&#x27;s support for Canadian revivalist Todd Bentley. Bentley has claimed that God heals the sick, and sometimes even raises people from the dead in his meetings—including three people in Pakistan—reports of which were carried by Morningstar TV which is part of Joyner&#x27;s Heritage International Ministries. ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; reporting concerning the &quot;Lakeland Revival,&quot; before his marital problems became news, stated that &quot;Not a single claim of Bentley&#x27;s healing powers could be independently verified.&quot; However, the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; reported on the same series of meetings, &quot;The revival&#x27;s media relations staff has tried to document healings. They e-mailed the &quot;Observer&quot; information on 15 people reportedly healed, providing phone numbers for each and noting that 12 had received medical verification. The &quot;Observer&quot; contacted five, plus three whose names were not provided, including Burgee. Each said God had healed them through, or related to, Bentley and the Lakeland services.&quot;

Joyner&#x27;s public relationship with Bentley began when he appeared on stage in Lakeland with other church leaders to lay hands on Bentley. After Bentley&#x27;s divorce from his wife in 2008, Joyner decided to oversee the process of &quot;restoring&quot; Bentley along with Jack Deere and Bill Johnson. Joyner made the announcement of the remarriage on March 9, 2009. He also released a statement as to why he chose to be a part of the restoration.

There has also been some controversy about Joyner joining the Knights of Malta (Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller). Joyner released a long statement explaining who they are and why he joined.

Joyner is a promoter of the dominionist theology known as the Seven Mountain Mandate or Seven Mountains of Influence, which advocates the need for Christians to be involved in leadership in the seven spheres of cultural influence. Joyner promotes the ministry of Lance Wallnau who teaches on the Seven Mountains theology; MorningStar Ministries carries a long list of materials by Wallnau.

In March 2021, Joyner urged Christians to own weapons to prepare for what he believes will be an inevitable civil war in the United States against those who he says stole the 2020 presidential election from the Republicans.

==In popular culture==
In April 2013, Joyner and his daughter, Anna Jane Joyner, a climate change activist and founder of Good Energy, participated in the Showtime documentary &quot;Years of Living Dangerously&quot;, a nine-part series focused on climate change. In the fourth episode, celebrity Ian Somerhalder follows Anna Jane as she tries to persuade her father, a climate change denier, to change his mind about global warming.

==Personal life==
Rick and his wife, Julie, have five children: Anna, Aaryn, Amber, Ben, and Sam. All of his children disagree with his political views.

<doc id="984619" wikidata="Q595658" url="?curid=984619" title="Velocipede">
<text>A velocipede () is a human-powered land vehicle with one or more wheels. The most common type of velocipede today is the bicycle.

The term was probably first coined by Karl von Drais in French as &quot;vélocipède&quot; for the French translation of his advertising leaflet for his version of the &quot;Laufmaschine&quot;, also now called a &#x27;dandy horse&#x27;, which he had developed in 1817. It is ultimately derived from the Latin &quot;velox&quot;, &quot;veloc-&quot; &#x27;swift&#x27; + &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;ped-&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27;. The term &#x27;velocipede&#x27; is today mainly used as a collective term for the different forerunners of the monowheel, the unicycle, the bicycle, the dicycle, the tricycle and the quadracycle developed between 1817 and 1880. Velocipede refers especially to the forerunner of the modern bicycle that was propelled, like a modern tricycle, by cranks, i.e. pedals, attached to the front axle before the invention of geared chains and belt and shaft drives powering the rear.

== History ==
Among the early velocipedes there were designs with one, two, three, four, and even five wheels. Some two-wheeled designs had pedals mounted on the front wheel, while three- and four-wheeled designs sometimes used treadles and levers to drive the rear wheels.

The earliest usable and much-copied velocipede was created by the German Karl Drais and called a &quot;Laufmaschine&quot; (German for &quot;running machine&quot;), which he first rode on June 12, 1817. He obtained a patent in January 1818. This was the world&#x27;s first balance bicycle and quickly became popular in both the United Kingdom and France, where it was sometimes called a &quot;draisine&quot; (German and English), &quot;draisienne&quot; (French), a &quot;vélocipède&quot; (French), a &quot;swiftwalker&quot;, a &quot;dandy horse&quot; (as it was very popular among dandies) or a &quot;Hobby horse&quot;. It was made entirely of wood and metal and despite the condition of the roads at the time was sometimes ridden for long distances.

It was almost 40 years until &quot;velocipede&quot; came into common usage as a generic term, with the launch of the first pedal-equipped bicycle, developed by Pierre Michaux, Pierre Lallement and the Olivier brothers in the 1860s. The Michaux company was the first to mass-produce the velocipede, from 1857 to 1871. That French design was sometimes called the boneshaker, since it was also made entirely of wood, then later with metal tires. That in combination with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. These velocipedes also became a fad, and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities. In 1891 &quot;L&#x27;Industrie Vélocipédique&quot; &quot;(Cycling Industry)&quot; magazine described &#x27;La Société Parisienne de constructions Velo&#x27; as &#x27;the oldest velocipede manufacturer in France&#x27;, having been founded in 1876 by M. Reynard, and awarded the &#x27;Diploma of honour&#x27; at the Exposition Universelle (1878) (World&#x27;s Fair).

During the 1870s advances in metallurgy led to the development of the first all-metal velocipedes. The pedals were still attached directly to the front wheel, which became larger and larger as makers realised that the larger the wheel, the farther you could travel with one rotation of the pedals. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor. This type of velocipede was the first one to be called a bicycle (&quot;two wheel&quot;), and its shape led to the nickname penny-farthing in the United Kingdom. They enjoyed a great popularity among young men in the 1880s who could afford them. 

While young men were risking their necks on the high wheels, ladies and dignified gentlemen such as doctors and clergymen of the 1880s favoured the less risky tricycle. Many innovations for tricycles eventually found their way into the automobile, such as rack and pinion steering, the differential, and band brakes, the forerunners to drum brakes.

== Boneshaker ==
Boneshaker (or bone-shaker) is a name dating from the 1860s for the first type of true bicycle with pedals, which were called velocipedes by their manufacturers. &quot;Boneshaker&quot; referred to the extremely uncomfortable ride, which was caused by the stiff wrought-iron frame and wooden wheels surrounded by tires made of iron.

=== History ===

The so-called &quot;boneshaker&quot; was invented in the 1860s in France and first manufactured by the Michaux company from 1867 to 1869 , the time of the first bicycle craze. The boneshaker was copied by many others during that time. It fell out of favor after the summer of 1869 and was replaced in 1870 with the type of bicycle called &quot;ordinary&quot;, &quot;high-wheel&quot;, or &quot;penny-farthing&quot;.

Few original boneshakers exist today, most having been melted for scrap metal during World War I. Those that do surface from time to time command high prices, typically up to about $5,000 US.

=== Design ===
The construction of the boneshaker was similar to the dandy horse: wooden wheels with iron tires and a framework of wrought iron. As the name implies it was extremely uncomfortable, but the discomfort was somewhat ameliorated by a long flat spring that supported the saddle and absorbed some of the shocks from rough road surfaces. The boneshaker also had a brakea metal lever that pressed a wooden pad against the rear wheel. The front wheel axle ran in lubricated bronze bearings, and some had small lubrication tanks that would wick oil from soaked lamb&#x27;s wool into the bearings to help them run smoothly. Like the High Wheel bicycles that became popular later in the 19th century, boneshakers were front-wheel drive, but in comparison they had smaller wheels (only about 1 m), and were heavy, with a lightweight model weighing or more.
== In railroad use ==

Railroads in North America often made use of a three-wheeled handcar designed to be operated by a single person, which came to be known as a &quot;railway velocipede&quot; or &quot;railroad velocipede&quot;. The three-wheel hand-pump rail car&#x27;s invention is credited to George S. Sheffield of Three Rivers, Michigan. Legend has it that because of inadequate train service to his home, Sheffield built a simple three-wheel car, allowing him to commute between home and work without having to walk. While so traveling one evening, he discovered a break in the track, and flagged down a night freight train, thus preventing a possible accident. The railroad rewarded his efforts by bankrolling his invention. George Sheffield obtained the patent for his device in 1879, calling it a &quot;velocipede hand car.&quot; Originally manufactured by G.S. Sheffield &amp; Co. and later manufactured by Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Company, the Sheffield velocipede remained in use up to World War II.

<text>&quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; is a comedy sketch written by Peter Cook and most famously performed by Cook and Dudley Moore. It is a classic example of comedy arising from an absurd situation which the participants take entirely seriously (comic irony), and a demonstration of the construction of a sketch in order to draw a laugh from the audience with almost every line. Peter Cook said that this was one of the most perfect sketches he had acted in, and that it amazed him, later in his career, that he could have created it so young, at the age of 17 or 18.

It first appeared in a Pembroke College revue, &quot;Something Borrowed&quot;, in 1960 (where it was titled &quot;Leg Too Few&quot; as the show had an alphabetical theme and the sketch appeared under the letter &quot;L&quot;) and later the same year in the Footlights revue, &quot;Pop Goes Mrs Jessop&quot;. It appeared on the West End stage for the first time in 1961 as part of &quot;One Over the Eight&quot;, a revue starring Kenneth Williams. Its first public performance with Dudley Moore in the role of Spiggot was as part of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; at the Cambridge Arts Theatre on April 21, 1961. Although it was initially omitted from the London production of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; (due to &quot;One Over The Eight&quot; running concurrently at a nearby theatre), it was reinstated for the show&#x27;s transfer to Broadway. Cook and Moore also performed the sketch in their 1973 stage show &quot;Behind the Fridge&quot; (retitled &quot;Good Evening!&quot; in the USA), and also gave standalone performances on various occasions, including the 1965 Royal Variety Performance, a 1976 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and the 1989 charity show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;. A version of the sketch, in which Spiggott is applying for a job as a runner, appeared in Cook and Moore&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

==Sketch==
The sketch takes place in the office of a casting agent. Cook plays the agent and Moore the prospective actor, a Mr Spiggott (this name was a favourite of Cook&#x27;s, and was re-used as the earthly identity of the Devil in &quot;Bedazzled&quot;). Cook begins the sketch by calling for his secretary to show the next auditioner into the office. Moore, a one-legged man, enters, hopping on his right foot. Moore&#x27;s left leg is tied up behind him and obscured beneath an overcoat during the sketch (Moore did actually have a slightly deformed left leg in real life as the result of a club foot). Eventually, Moore comes to a stop, balanced on one leg. He is required to hold this position for most of the sketch, his difficulty in doing so occasioning much amusement from the audience (though in most performances, he has a chair to hold on to for balance). The premise of the sketch is then laid out thus:

:Cook: Mr Spiggott – you are, I believe, auditioning for the part of Tarzan.
:Moore: Right.
:Cook: Now Mr Spiggott, I couldn&#x27;t help noticing – almost at once – that you are a one-legged person.
:Moore: You noticed that?
:Cook: I noticed that, Mr Spiggott. When you have been in the business as long as I have, you come to notice these little things almost instinctively.

The agent goes on to point out that Tarzan is &quot;a role which traditionally involves the use of a two-legged actor&quot; and that it would be unusual for the part to be taken by a &quot;unidexter&quot;, but Spiggott&#x27;s enthusiasm is undimmed. Cook keeps a straight face as he explains exactly why Spiggott is unsuitable for the role.

:Cook: Need I say with over much emphasis that it is in the leg division that you are deficient.
:Moore: The leg division?
:Cook: Yes, the leg division, Mr Spiggott. You are deficient in it to the tune of one. Your right leg, I like. I &quot;like&quot; your right leg. A lovely leg for the role. That&#x27;s what I said when I saw you come in. I said, &quot;A lovely leg for the role.&quot; I&#x27;ve got nothing against your right leg. The trouble is – neither have you. 

Cook would often add the line &#x27;you fall down on your left&#x27; in other versions of the sketch.

The sketch continues in a similar vein with the agent observing that at least Spiggott scores over a man with no legs at all (in the later versions, Spiggot enthusiastically agrees that he has &quot;twice as many&quot; as a man with none) and that there is always a chance that no two-legged actor will apply for the role &quot;in, say, the next eighteen months,&quot; in which case Spiggott, as a &quot;unidexter,&quot; is &quot;just the sort of person we shall be attempting to contact telephonically.&quot; Spiggott, clearly an eternal optimist, leaves the office happy with these reassurances. 

In some early versions of the sketch (including the one recorded by Kenneth Williams), a further punchline follows after Moore has left. A two-legged actor walks in normally:

:Cook: Ah, good morning Mr. Stanger. Now I believe you are applying for the role of Long John Silver.

<doc id="984629" wikidata="Q7551001" url="?curid=984629" title="Social complexity">
<text>In sociology, social complexity is a conceptual framework used in the analysis of society. In the sciences, contemporary definitions of complexity are found in systems theory, wherein the phenomenon being studied has many parts and many possible arrangements of the parts; simultaneously, what is complex and what is simple are relative and change in time.

Contemporary usage of the term &quot;complexity&quot; specifically refers to sociologic theories of society as a complex adaptive system, however, social complexity and its emergent properties are recurring subjects throughout the historical development of social philosophy and the study of social change. 

Early theoreticians of sociology, such as Ferdinand Tönnies, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto and Georg Simmel, examined the exponential growth and interrelatedness of social encounters and social exchanges. The emphases on the interconnectivity among social relationships, and the emergence of new properties within society, is found in the social theory produced in the subfields of sociology. Social complexity is a basis for the connection of the phenomena reported in microsociology and macrosociology, and thus provides an intellectual middle-range for sociologists to formulate and develop hypotheses. Methodologically, social complexity is theory-neutral, and includes the phenomena studied in microsociology and the phenomena studied in macrosociology.

==Theoretic background==

In 1937, the sociologist Talcott Parsons continued the work of the early theoreticians of sociology with his work on action theory; and by 1951, Parson had developed action theory into formal systems theory in &quot;The Social System&quot; (1951). In the following decades, the synergy between general systems thinking and the development of social system theories is carried forward by Robert K. Merton in discussions of theories of the middle-range and social structure and agency. From the late 1970s until the early 1990s, sociological investigation concerned the properties of systems in which the strong correlation of sub-parts leads to the observation of autopoetic, self-organizing, dynamical, turbulent, and chaotic behaviours that arise from mathematical complexity, such as the work of Niklas Luhmann.

One of the earliest usages of the term &quot;complexity&quot;, in the social and behavioral sciences, to refer specifically to a complex system is found in the study of modern organizations and management studies. However, particularly in management studies, the term often has been used in a metaphorical rather than in a qualitative or quantitative theoretical manner. By the mid-1990s, the &quot;complexity turn&quot; in social sciences begins as some of the same tools generally used in complexity science are incorporated into the social sciences. By 1998, the international, electronic periodical, &quot;Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation&quot;, had been created. In the last several years, many publications have presented overviews of complexity theory within the field of sociology. Within this body of work, connections also are drawn to yet other theoretical traditions, including constructivist epistemology and the philosophical positions of phenomenology, postmodernism and critical realism.

==Methodologies==

Methodologically, social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts and there are many possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.

At the most localized level of analysis, ethnographic, participant- or non-participant observation, content analysis and other qualitative research methods may be appropriate. More recently, highly sophisticated quantitative research methodologies are being developed and used in sociology at both local and global levels of analysis. Such methods include (but are not limited to) bifurcation diagrams, network analysis, non-linear modeling, and computational models including cellular automata programming, sociocybernetics and other methods of social simulation.

===Complex social network analysis===

Complex social network analysis is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional social network analysis, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis are coming out of the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.

New methods of global network analysis are emerging from the work of John Urry and the sociological study of globalization, linked to the work of Manuel Castells and the later work of Immanuel Wallerstein. Since the late 1990s, Wallerstein increasingly makes use of complexity theory, particularly the work of Ilya Prigogine. Dynamic social network analysis is linked to a variety of methodological traditions, above and beyond systems thinking, including graph theory, traditional social network analysis in sociology, and mathematical sociology. It also links to mathematical chaos and complex dynamics through the work of Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, as well as fractal geometry through Albert-László Barabási and his work on scale-free networks.

===Computational sociology===

The development of computational sociology involves such scholars as Nigel Gilbert, Klaus G. Troitzsch, Joshua M. Epstein, and others. The foci of methods in this field include social simulation and data-mining, both of which are sub-areas of computational sociology. Social simulation uses computers to create an artificial laboratory for the study of complex social systems; data-mining uses machine intelligence to search for non-trivial patterns of relations in large, complex, real-world databases. The emerging methods of socionics are a variant of computational sociology.

Computational sociology is influenced by a number of micro-sociological areas as well as the macro-level traditions of systems science and systems thinking. The micro-level influences of symbolic interaction, exchange, and rational choice, along with the micro-level focus of computational political scientists, such as Robert Axelrod, helped to develop computational sociology&#x27;s bottom-up, agent-based approach to modeling complex systems. This is what Joshua M. Epstein calls generative science. Other important areas of influence include statistics, mathematical modeling and computer simulation.

===Sociocybernetics===

Sociocybernetics integrates sociology with second-order cybernetics and the work of Niklas Luhmann, along with the latest advances in complexity science. In terms of scholarly work, the focus of sociocybernetics has been primarily conceptual and only slightly methodological or empirical. Sociocybernetics is directly tied to systems thought inside and outside of sociology, specifically in the area of second-order cybernetics.

==Areas of application==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the diversity of areas of application has grown as more sophisticated methods have developed. Social complexity theory is applied in studies of social cooperation and public goods; altruism; education; global civil society collective action and social movements; social inequality; workforce and unemployment; policy analysis; health care systems; and innovation and social change, to name a few. A current international scientific research project, the Seshat: Global History Databank, was explicitly designed to analyze changes in social complexity from the Neolithic Revolution until the Industrial Revolution.

As a middle-range theoretical platform, social complexity can be applied to any research in which social interaction or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be measured and expressed as continuous or discrete data points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data. Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology. From childhood friendships and teen pregnancy to criminology and counter-terrorism, theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all areas of sociological research.

In the area of communications research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications. Scientometrics and bibliometrics are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.

<text>Karan Yash Johar (born Rahul Kumar Johar; 25 May 1972), often informally referred to as KJo, is an Indian filmmaker, producer and television personality who primarily works in Hindi cinema. He has launched the careers of several successful actors and filmmakers under his company Dharma Productions. The recipient of several accolades, including two National Film Awards and seven Filmfare Awards, he has been honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2020.

The son of producer Yash Johar, he made his directorial debut with the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), which earned him the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment (as director), the Filmfare Award for Best Director and the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay. His next films, the family drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001) and the musical romantic drama &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), were both major commercial successes in both domestic and overseas markets. His social drama &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010) earned him his second Filmfare Award for Best Director. Johar produced the spy thriller &quot;Raazi&quot; (2018) and the biopic &quot;Shershaah&quot; (2021), both of which won him the Filmfare Award for Best Film, with the latter also earning him the National Film Award – Special Jury Mention as producer. These, along with other films he has produced or directed under his company, have established him as one of the leading filmmakers in Hindi cinema.

Johar has also ventured into other avenues of the entertainment industry. He hosts a television talk show, &quot;Koffee with Karan&quot; since 2004, a dating show &quot;What the Love!&quot; and a radio show &quot;Calling Karan&quot;, and appeared as a judge on competition reality shows &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa&quot; and &quot;India&#x27;s Got Talent.&quot;

== Early and personal life ==
Johar was born on 25 May 1972 in Bombay, India to a Punjabi father, film producer Yash Johar, founder of Dharma Productions and a Sindhi mother, Hiroo Johar. He grew up in what he calls a &quot;cosmopolitan house&quot;, as they all communicated in English and his father, an Arya Samaji, would begin his day by reciting Hindu, Sikh and Christian prayers. He studied at the Green Lawns High School. In his autobiography, &quot;An Unsuitable Boy&quot;, Johar recounts that he took the entrance test of the elite all-boys boarding school, The Doon School in Dehradun, but scored a zero in mathematics. This led the then headmaster Gulab Ramchandani, who was Hiroo&#x27;s uncle, to write a very &quot;emotional letter&quot; to her, declining admission for her son. After Greenlawns High School, Warden Road, he attended H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, both in Mumbai.

Johar started his career in the entertainment industry as an actor, when he played the role of Shrikant in the 1989 Doordarshan serial &quot;Indradhanush&quot;. As a child, he was influenced by commercial Indian cinema: He cites Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra and Sooraj Barjatya as his inspirations. For a time, Johar followed numerology, creating film titles in which the first word and a number of others in the title began with the letter K. After watching the 2006 comedy-drama &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot; which was critical of numerology, Johar decided to stop this practice.

Discussing his sexual orientation, Johar said &quot;Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don&#x27;t need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won&#x27;t only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this&quot;. In February 2017, Johar became father to twins (a boy and a girl) through surrogacy. The twins were born at Masrani Hospital in Mumbai. Johar named his son Yash after his father, and his daughter Roohi named by rearranging his mother&#x27;s name Hiroo.

In 2020, the death of Sushant Singh Rajput sparked a debate on nepotism in the Hindi film industry. Johar was one of the personalities who was targeted by the late actor&#x27;s fans for allegedly encouraging nepotism by casting children of established Bollywood stars in his films instead of outsider talents. Johar was first accused of this by Kangana Ranaut on &quot;Koffee With Karan&quot;. Various members of the industry came to his defence. A complaint was filed against Johar and other Bollywood actors &quot;for abetting&quot; Rajput&#x27;s suicide. Discussing nepotism, Johar said that his production house has introduced 21 debut directors, &quot;out of which, I can say, 16–17 are not &#x27;nepotistic&#x27; young filmmakers. They are not from the fraternity or the industry. They are completely from outside.&quot; Regarding his casting insiders, Johar said, &quot;Why do they discredit some of the actors who are from (the industry)? I think they are talented enough to face the camera&quot;.

== Film career ==
=== Director ===

==== Initial work, debut and breakthrough (1995–2001) ====
Johar entered the film industry as an assistant director and actor on his cousin, Aditya Chopra&#x27;s (1995), which is one of the most successful films to date. 

He made his own directorial debut with the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998). The first half of the film centers on a college love triangle between an insensitive boy (Shah Rukh Khan), his tomboyish best friend (Kajol), and the prettiest girl at the college (Rani Mukerji), while the second half centers on the now-widowed boy&#x27;s attempt to reconnect with his best friend who is now engaged to marry a businessman (Salman Khan). The film became a major blockbuster at the box-office and received positive reviews from critics. Writing for PlanetBollywood.com, critic Anish Khanna commented that &quot;Johar makes an impressive directorial debut, has a good script sense, and knows how to make a film with S-T-Y-L-E.&quot; It won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It swept most of the major awards at the 44th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and all four acting awards.

Johar achieved his breakthrough with the ensemble family drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001). The film starred Amitabh Bachchan as an egotistical rich industrialist, Jaya Bachchan as his compassionate wife, and Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan as their two sons. It also featured Kajol and Kareena Kapoor as sisters from a lower-class family who become the love interests of Khan and Roshan respectively. The film became Johar&#x27;s second consecutive major blockbuster at the box-office and received positive reviews from critics. Critic Taran Adarsh commented that Johar &quot;confirms the fact that he is the brightest in film firmament. The premise [of the film] is simple, but it is the storytelling that deserves the highest marks.&quot; &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

==== Widespread success (2006–10) ====

Johar&#x27;s third directorial venture was the ensemble musical romantic drama &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), which dealt with the controversial subject of marital infidelity and dysfunctional relationships set against the backdrop of non-resident Indians (NRIs) living in New York City. The film&#x27;s plot follows a washed-up athlete (Shah Rukh Khan), whose frustration with his wife (Preity Zinta) results in an extramarital affair with a family friend (Rani Mukerji), a schoolteacher who is also unhappy with her marriage to her childhood friend (Abhishek Bachchan). The film emerged as Johar&#x27;s third consecutive major blockbuster at the box-office and emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time in overseas markets at the time. It received highly positive reviews from critics who praised Johar&#x27;s departure from the directorial style of his first two films. Rajeev Masand wrote, &quot;Few writers have such solid control over their screenplay as Johar does. Few understand the intricacies of narrative as well as he does. Johar goes from highs to lows, from plateaus to peaks with the ease of a pro. He knows exactly how to turn a seemingly ordinary scene into something special with just that one line of dialogue, or that hint of background music.&quot; The script of the film which was co-written by Johar received recognition by a number of critics and was invited to be included in the library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

Johar&#x27;s next directorial venture was the social drama &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010), his first film not written by him. The plot follows a Muslim man with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and his Hindu wife, played by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who live in San Francisco and face racial prejudice after 11 September attacks. The film became Johar&#x27;s fourth consecutive major blockbuster in both domestic and overseas markets, and received rave reviews from critics who praised Johar&#x27;s unconventional directorial style. Critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that the film &quot;is a flawless work, as perfect in content, tone, and treatment as any film can get.&quot; &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; won Johar his second Filmfare Award for Best Director.

==== Continued success and experimental projects (2012–18) ====
For his next feature film &quot;Student of the Year&quot; (2012), Johar chose not to cast established actors for his lead roles and instead recruited three debutante actors (Sidharth Malhotra, Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan). The plot revolved around the quest of a group of students who are all gunning for the title of &quot;Student of the Year&quot; at their college. The film was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. Some called it &quot;supremely entertaining and enjoyable,&quot; while others called it &quot;a film which suffers from the lack-of-a-story syndrome.&quot;

Johar then teamed up with Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, and Dibakar Banerjee for &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; (2013), an anthology film released to celebrate the centenary year of Hindi cinema. Each of these directors made one short film to contribute to the large anthology. The plot of Johar&#x27;s film followed a magazine editor (Rani Mukerji) who discovers that her husband (Randeep Hooda) is gay after an interaction with an intern at her office (Saqib Saleem). The film did not perform well at the box-office, but earned positive reviews from critics, with major praise for Johar&#x27;s segment earning him a nomination for the Queer Palm award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

Johar&#x27;s next directorial venture was the musical romantic drama &quot;Ae Dil Hai Mushkil&quot; (2016). The film featured Ranbir Kapoor as a man dealing with an unrequited love for his best friend, played by Anushka Sharma. It also featured Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as an older woman who engages in a brief relationship with Kapoor&#x27;s character, and Fawad Khan as the love interest of Sharma&#x27;s character. The film emerged as his fifth major blockbuster at the box-office and received positive reviews from critics, who called it &quot;Johar&#x27;s most grown-up film yet.&quot; &quot;Ae Dil Hai Mushkil&quot; earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

Johar teamed up again with Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, and Dibakar Banerjee for &quot;Lust Stories&quot; (2018), an anthology film released on Netflix that served as a follow-up to &quot;Bombay&quot; &quot;Talkies&quot;. The film was praised for its exploration of female sexuality, a subject rarely dealt with in Indian films. Johar&#x27;s segment revolved around a newly married schoolteacher (Kiara Advani) whose husband (Vicky Kaushal) fails to recognize her lack of sexual satisfaction.

==== Career expansion (2018–present) ====
In August 2018, Johar took to Twitter to announce his next film &quot;Takht&quot;, a period drama based in the Mughal era. It was supposed to feature an ensemble star cast of Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, Janhvi Kapoor, and Anil Kapoor. With a screenplay by Sumit Roy, dialogues by Hussain Haidry, and music composed by A. R. Rahman, it was supposed to be the second film directed by Johar that was not written by himself. In an interview with &quot;Firstpost&quot;, Johar stated that &quot;Takht&quot; would begin filming in September 2019. However, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire project was postponed, with Johar stating that he would pick it up again in the future.

In 2020, he reteamed with Banerjee, Akhtar and Kashyap for the horror anthology film &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Lust Stories&quot;. &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; premiered on Netflix on 1 January 2020. His segment in the film told the story of a newly-married woman (Mrunal Thakur) and her experience with her husband&#x27;s (Avinash Tiwary) post-traumatic stress disorder. Unlike its predecessors, it received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics upon release.

In July 2021, it was announced that Johar would direct a romantic comedy instead, titled &quot;Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani&quot;. It starred Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Ranveer Singh, and Alia Bhatt in lead roles. It was released on 28 July 2023 and emerged as a critical and commercial success, ranking as the seventh highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. It earned Johar his sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director, and was his second film not written by him.

On his 52nd birthday in 2024, Johar announced that his next directorial, set to release in the second half of 2025.

<text>Harriet Quimby (May 11, 1875 – July 1, 1912) was an American pioneering aviator, journalist, and film screenwriter. In 1911, she became the first woman in the United States to receive a pilot&#x27;s license and in 1912 the first woman to fly across the English Channel. Although Quimby died at the age of 37 in a flying accident, she strongly influenced the role of women in aviation.

==Early life and early career==

She was born on May 11, 1875. Because there is no official birth certificate, her place of birth is not known, and many communities in Michigan have claimed to be her birthplace, among them Coldwater and Arcadia Township.

Her father had purchased a farm in Arcadia Township in 1874, and the family was recorded there in the 1880 United States census. They moved to Arroyo Grande, California, about 1888. After her family moved to San Francisco, California, in the early 1900s, Quimby initially tried her hand at stage acting, using the stage name &quot;Hazel Quimby&quot;. She is known to have appeared in at least two plays: as Romeo in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; opposite Linda Arvidson&#x27;s Juliet (before Arvidson married film director D.W. Griffith), and a minor role in a production of &quot;Sappho&quot;. Ultimately deciding that acting was not for her, Quimby decided to become a journalist.

In 1902 Harriet Quimby began writing for the &quot;San Francisco Dramatic Review&quot; and also contributed to the Sunday editions of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;&#x27; and &quot;San Francisco Call&quot;.

She moved to Manhattan, New York City, in 1903 to work as a theater critic for &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Weekly&quot;. She published more than 250 articles over a nine-year period.

==Aviation==
Quimby became interested in aviation in 1910 when she attended the International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. There she met John Moisant, a well-known aviator and operator of a flight school, and his sister Matilde. Quimby learned to fly at the Moisant Aviation School. Alfred Moisant, John Moisant&#x27;s brother, was her flight instructor at the Moisant Aviation School.

On August 1, 1911, she took her pilot&#x27;s test and became the first American woman to earn a pilot&#x27;s license, Fédération Aéronautique Internationale certificate #37, issued to her by the Aero Club of America. Quimby received her pilots license after thirty-three flight lessons and two test flights. Matilde Moisant soon followed and became the second.

Quimby continued to write for &quot;Leslie&#x27;s&quot; even when touring with airshows, and recounted her flying adventures in a series of articles as the publication&#x27;s aviation editor. Ironically, one of the first articles published under her new title was &quot;The Dangers of Flying and How to Avoid Them,&quot; an account of pilots who had died and a discussion of the need for proper safety precautions. Despite her knowledge of the risks, and committed to her new passion of flying, she promoted the economic potential of commercial aviation and touted flying as an ideal sport for women.

After earning her pilot&#x27;s license, Quimby acted to capitalize on her new status. The press called her the &quot;Dresden China Aviatrix&quot; or &quot;China Doll&quot;, because of her petite stature and fair skin. Pilots could earn as much as US$1,000 per performance, and prize money for a race could go as high as $10,000 or more. Quimby joined the Moisant International Aviators, an exhibition team, and made her professional debut in 1911, earning $1,500 in a night flight over Staten Island before a crowd of almost 20,000 spectators.

As one of the country&#x27;s few female pilots, she capitalized on her femininity by wearing a plum-colored satin blouse, necklace, and antique bracelet, with more practical trousers and high-laced boots. She drew crowds whenever she competed in cross-country meets and races. As part of the exhibition team, Quimby showcased her talents around the United States and traveled to Mexico City at the end of 1911 to participate in aviation activities held in honor of the inauguration of President Francisco I. Madero.

==Hollywood==
In 1911 Quimby also wrote seven screenplays or scenarios that were developed as silent film shorts by Biograph Studios. All seven were directed by D. W. Griffith. Stars in her films included Florence La Badie, Wilfred Lucas, and Blanche Sweet. Quimby had a small acting role in one movie.

== Vin Fiz ==

The Vin Fiz Company, a division of Armour Meat Packing Plant of Chicago, used Quimby to advertise the new grape soda, Vin Fiz, after the death of Calbraith Perry Rodgers in April 1912. She appeared in adverts in her distinctive purple aviator uniform.

==English Channel flight==

On April 16, 1912, Quimby took off from Dover, England, in route to Calais, France, and made the flight in 59 minutes, landing about from Calais on a beach in Équihen-Plage, Pas-de-Calais. She was the first woman to pilot an aircraft across the English Channel. Her accomplishment received little media attention as it occurred the day after the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; ocean liner. To complete her flight across the English Channel she purchased a Bleriot 50 monoplane.

==Death==

On July 1, 1912, Quimby flew in the Third Annual Boston Aviation Meet at Squantum, Massachusetts. Although she had obtained her ACA certificate to participate in ACA events, the Boston meet was an unsanctioned contest. Quimby flew out to Boston Light in Boston Harbor at about , then returned and circled the airfield.

William A. P. Willard, the event organizer and father of aviator Charles F. Willard, was a passenger in her brand-new two-seat Bleriot monoplane. At an altitude of , the aircraft unexpectedly pitched forward, for reasons unknown. Willard was ejected. The airplane flipped over and Quimby was also ejected; both fell to their deaths, while the plane &quot;glided down and lodged itself in the mud&quot;.

Harriet Quimby died at age 37 and was buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. The following year her remains were moved to the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. A cenotaph to Quimby, the Harriet Quimby Compass Rose Fountain, was erected at Pierce Brothers/Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in Burbank, California. Located close to the cemetery&#x27;s Portal of the Folded Wings, a shrine containing the ashes of aviation pioneers, the Quimby fountain&#x27;s plaque reads:

Harriet Quimby became the first licensed female pilot in America on August 1, 1911. On April 16, 1912, she was the first woman to fly a plane across the English Channel. She pointed the direction for future women pilots including her friend, Matilde Moisant, buried at the Portal of the Folded Wings. The number of licensed female pilots increased to 200 total by 1930 and between 700 to 800 by 1935.

==Legacy==
In 1991 the United States Postal Service issued a 50 cent airmail postage stamp featuring Harriet Quimby. Written on these stamps was &quot;Harriet Quimby: Pioneer Pilot.&quot;

She is memorialized in two official Michigan historical markers. One is located near Coldwater. The other was erected near the now abandoned family farmhouse in Arcadia Township where Quimby lived from 1875 to about 1888.

In 2004 Quimby was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

In 2012 Quimby was inducted into the Long Island Air and Space Hall of Fame.

The Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome possesses a flyable Anzani-powered one-seater Blériot XI, which bears the Blériot factory&#x27;s serial number 56, showing that it was manufactured in 1909. Since Quimby&#x27;s plane that she flew in 1912 was a brand new two-seater, the idea that the former was the aircraft that she was flying at the time of her death seems to be an urban legend.

Quimby Road at Reid–Hillview Airport in San Jose, California, is named in her honor. There are also streets named after her in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (near its airport), Saint-Laurent, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal) and Opfikon, Switzerland. 

==Film and television portrayals==

Quimby has been portrayed on screen on a few occasions. 

* Her life story was dramatized in the March 23, 1952, instalment of &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; entitled &quot;Harriet Quimby.&quot; Directed by William Corrigan, the early US TV production featured British actress Sarah Churchill as Quimby. 
* A fictionalized version of Quimby, played by Canadian actress Claudette Mink, appears in the 2000 telefilm &quot;&quot;, which has Quimby encountering the title character after crash-landing her biplane near Cutter Gap (in real life, Quimby only flew single-wing aircraft and until her fatal accident only suffered minor mishaps during her flying career).
* A 28-minute short film from Sterling Scripts, &quot;Lady of the Air: The Story of Harriet Quimby&quot;, released to Youtube and elsewhere online in 2020, features actress Bri Brown delivering a dramatic monologue as Quimby, who describes both her life and the circumstances of her death. It was written by Sterling Brown.

In 2015, American media, citing Allyn Mark, president of Industry Visions Pictures, reported that plans were under way for a biographical film entitled &quot;Aeroplane Angel&quot; that would dramatize Quimby&#x27;s life. As of 2024, no production has as yet eventuated.

==In fiction==
* A character based upon and named after Harriet Quimby appears in the 1961 science fiction novel &quot;Time is the Simplest Thing&quot; by Clifford D. Simak. Quimby is depicted as a telepath and onetime girlfriend who aids the protagonist for part of the story, which is set in an alternative future; she is depicted as being a strong-willed journalist and skilled vehicle driver (something the real Quimby was, though Simak&#x27;s version drives a flying car).
* Quimby herself makes an appearance in the 2016 historical novel &quot;El Paso&quot; by Winston Groom.

<text>Magach (, , &quot;battering-ram&quot;) is the designation of a series of tanks in Israeli service. The tanks are based on the American M48 and M60 tanks. The name continued to be used for all M48/M60 tanks. Magach 1, 2, 3, and 5 are based on M48 series tanks, and Magach 6 and 7 are based on M60 series tanks.

==Service history==

The first M48 Patton tanks acquired by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were purchased from West Germany in the early 1960s (M48A2 variant) in a secret arms deal, followed by deliveries from the United States after 1965 (M48A1 and M48A2C vehicles) when Germany cancelled further deliveries after the deal was exposed.
During the 1967 war, the Israeli tanks served in their original (American) configuration. Following the 1967 war, several dozen Jordanian M48 tanks, captured intact during the 1967 Six-Day War, were also commissioned into the IDF, adding to the 150 already in service at that time. Israel also modified the tank to M48A3 automotive standard by replacing the gasoline engine with a diesel engine with more power and a reduced vulnerability to fuel fires, resulting in the Magach 3. These modifications also included replacing the original 90 mm gun with the British 105 mm L7 (US M68 equivalent), replacing the commander&#x27;s machine gun cupola with a lower-profile Urdan Cupola, and upgrading the communication suite.

When the Yom Kippur War broke out, Israel had 540 M48-series (with 105 mm gun) and M60/M60A1 tanks. During the war, the tanks suffered heavy losses. The location of flammable hydraulic fluid at the front of the turret was discovered to be a severe vulnerability. Egypt had destroyed a large number of Israeli tanks, and only 200 M48 and M60A1 tanks remained. Israel entrenched most of these tanks in the Sinai front against opposite entrenched Egyptian infantry armed with 9M14 Malyutka anti tank missiles. Israel replaced their war losses with new M48A5 (Magach 5), M60 (Magach 7), and M60A1 (Magach 6) during the 1970s. The older M60&#x27;s (which still used the smaller M48-style turret) were supplied to make up for a shortage of sufficient M60A1s, explaining why the older model has the higher designation.
Prior to the 1982 invasion of Lebanon (1982 Lebanon War), Magach 6 and 7 tanks were fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA). Further work has been done on the upgraded Magach 6 models, including new belly armor, Merkava tracks, new fire controls, a thermal sleeve for the gun and smoke grenades, eventually resulting in the Magach 6b (Bet) and ultimate 6b Gal Batash and equivalent Magach 7c Gimel models.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, the Magachs have been gradually replaced by Merkava tanks as Israel&#x27;s front-line main battle tank. However, a large majority of the IDF&#x27;s armored corps continued to consist of Magach variants until the 1990s, and the tank was continuously upgraded during this time.

By 2006, all Magachs in regular units had been replaced by Merkavas.

In July 2015, Israel officially unveiled the existence of the Pereh missile carrier. The Pereh is a guided missile carrier disguised as a tank. A Magach is converted into a Pereh tank destroyer by replacing the main battle gun with an anti-tank guided missile launch station. The original turret is enlarged to install a launcher under armor for 12 &quot;Tamuz&quot; Spike NLOS missiles, which can destroy targets out to . Disguised as a standard tank, the Pereh is fitted with a fake cannon barrel to the front, but can be identified easily by the curved antenna mounted at the rear on the roof of the turret, which is erected in firing position; additional features include add-on frontal armor and stowage boxes on the turret sides. Pictures of the Pereh were first released during Operation Protective Edge in July 2014.

==Source of the name &quot;Magach&quot;==
Contrary to a popular belief, &quot;Magach&quot; is not an abbreviation but a Hebrew word meaning &quot;battering-ram&quot;. However, as the word is very rarely used and is not known to many Hebrew speakers, several popular explanation backronyms of the name exist:
* Short for Merkavat Giborei Chayil (, literally &quot;Chariots of War Heroes&quot;).
* One version states that the real source of the name is the designation M48A3 (in Gematria, 40 is &quot;mem&quot; (&quot;m&quot;), 8 is &quot;chet&quot; (&quot;ch&quot;) and 3 is &quot;gimel&quot; (&quot;g&quot;)).
* Like the above, but &quot;g&quot; stands for Germany, a supplier of the first M48 tanks to Israel.
* Yet another version says that M48A3 can be read as MAgAch (4 looks like &quot;A&quot;, 8 like &quot;g&quot; etc.).
* A once popular macabre joke in the IDF said that &quot;Magach&quot; stands for &quot;Movil Gviyot Charukhot&quot;—&quot;charred bodies carrier&quot;, probably referring to the Yom Kippur War losses and particularly to the aforementioned flammable hydraulic fluid problem of the M48.
* Other variants include &quot;Meshupa Gahon&quot; (one with sloping belly) and even &quot;Mechonat Giluach Hashmalit&quot; (electric shaving machine).

==Versions==


*Magach 1: M48A1.
*Magach 2: M48A2C.
*Magach 3: Modernized M48A1/A2C/A3. The modifications included British 105 mm L7 cannon, low profile commander&#x27;s cupola, upgraded communication suite, a diesel engine Continental AVDS-1790-2A with Allison CD-850-6 transmission. They were eventually fitted with Blazer ERA.
*Magach 5: M48A5 in the original configuration. Generally similar to the Magach 3, but had slightly different engine and transmission—AVDS-1790-2D and CD-850-6A accordingly. They were eventually fitted with Blazer ERA.
*Magach 6: Modernized M60A1 or M60A3. Fitted with the Urdan low profile cupola and Blazer ERA.
**Magach 6A (6 Alef): Modernized M60A1. All vehicles were eventually upgraded to the Magach 6B level.
**Magach 6B (6 Bet): Similarly modernized M60A1 RISE (M60A1 with AVDS-1790-2C RISE (Reliability Improved Selected Equipment) engine).
**Magach 6B Gal (6 Bet Gal): Magach 6B with Gal fire control system.
**Magach 6B Gal Batash (6 Bet Gal Batash): Magach 6B Gal fitted with 4th generation passive armor and engine. The turret has angled sides and angled mantlet. This variant is sometimes unofficially referred to as Magach 7D or Magach 8. A limited number of vehicles were converted from the Magach 6B Gal variant.
**Magach 6B Baz (6 Bet Baz): Magach 6B fitted with Baz fire control system. A limited number of vehicles were converted from the Magach 6B variant.
**Magach 6C (6 Gimel): Modernized M60A3.
**Magach 6R (6 Resh): Modernized M60, with engine upgraded to the AVDS-1790-2AG level (with more powerful electric generator compared to that of AVDS-1790-2A).
**Magach 6R* (6 Resh*): Magach 6R with preparations for mounting Nachal Oz fire control system.
**Magach 6M (6 Mem): Magach 6R* fitted with Nachal Oz fire control system.
*Magach 7: M60 with AVDS-1790-5A engine, additional passive armor, new fire control and Merkava-based tracks. Different configurations exist:
**Magach 7A (7 Alef): Fixed flat mantlet with gun &quot;slots&quot;.
**Magach 7B (7 Bet): An interim model with armor configuration similar to the 7C. Apparently never reached production.
**Magach 7C (7 Gimel): Fixed angled mantlet with gun &quot;slots&quot;.
*Pereh missile carrier: Guided missile artillery variant armed with the Spike missile.
*Magachon: Heavy APC variant dropped in favour of HAPCs converted from the Centurion Nagmachon because they are easier to convert and provide better protection.
Magach should not be confused with the Sabra series of upgrade packages for the M60A1/A3, which were developed for export to Turkey. Sabra includes upgrades similar to those of the Magach 7, but an essential difference is that it is armed with the MG251 120 mm smooth-bore gun (the same as used by the Merkava 3).

<doc id="984654" wikidata="Q648945" url="?curid=984654" title="Declaratory judgment">
<text>A declaratory judgment, also called a declaration, is the legal determination of a court that resolves legal uncertainty for the litigants. It is a form of legally binding preventive by which a party involved in an actual or possible legal matter can ask a court to conclusively rule on and affirm the rights, duties, or obligations of one or more parties in a civil dispute (subject to any appeal). The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States, and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity. A declaratory judgment does not by itself order any action by a party, or imply damages or an injunction, although it may be accompanied by one or more other remedies.

A declaratory judgment is generally distinguished from an advisory opinion because the latter does not resolve an actual case or controversy. Declaratory judgments can provide legal certainty to each party in a matter when this could resolve or assist in a disagreement. Often an early resolution of legal rights will resolve some or all of the other issues in a matter.

A declaratory judgment is typically requested when a party is threatened with a lawsuit but the lawsuit has not yet been filed; or when a party or parties believe that their rights under law and/or contract might conflict; or as part of a counterclaim to prevent further lawsuits from the same plaintiff (for example, when only a contract claim is filed, but a copyright claim might also be applicable). In some instances, a declaratory judgment is filed because the statute of limitations against a potential defendant may pass before the plaintiff incurs damage (for example, a malpractice statute applicable to a certified public accountant may be shorter than the time period the IRS has to assess a taxpayer for additional tax due to bad advice given by the CPA).

Declaratory judgments are authorized by statute in most common-law jurisdictions. In the United States, the federal government and most states enacted statutes in the 1920s and 1930s authorizing their courts to issue declaratory judgments.

==Cease and desist==
The filing of a declaratory judgment lawsuit can follow the sending by one party of a cease-and-desist letter to another party. A party contemplating sending such a letter risks that the recipient, or a party related to the recipient (i.e. such as a customer or supplier), may file for a declaratory judgment in their own jurisdiction, or sue for minor damages in the law of unjustified threats. This may require the sender to appear in a distant court, at their own expense. So sending a cease-and-desist letter presents a dilemma to the sender, as it would be desirable to be able to address the issues at hand in a candid manner without the need for litigation. Upon receiving a cease-and-desist letter, the recipient may seek a tactical advantage by instituting declaratory-judgment litigation in a more favorable jurisdiction.

Sometimes the parties agree in advance of discussions that no declaratory-judgment lawsuit will be filed while the negotiations are continuing. Sometimes a lawsuit is filed, but not served, before sending such a notice, to preserve a jurisdiction advantage without engaging the judicial process fully. Some parties send cease-and-desist letters that make &quot;an oblique suggestion of possible infringement&quot; to lower the risk of the recipient filing a declaratory-judgment lawsuit.

==Declaratory judgment actions in patent litigation==
Declaratory judgments are common in patent litigation, as well as in other areas of intellectual property litigation, because declaratory judgments allow an alleged infringer to &quot;clear the air&quot; about a product or service that may be a business&#x27;s focal point. For example, in a typical patent-infringement claim, when a patent owner becomes aware of an infringer, the owner can simply wait until he pleases to bring an infringement suit. Meanwhile, the monetary damages continuously accrue – with no effort expended by the patent owner, apart from marking the patent number on products the patent owner sold or licensed. On the other hand, the alleged infringer could do nothing to rectify the situation if no declaratory judgment existed. The alleged infringer would be forced to continue to operate his business with the cloud of a lawsuit over his head. The declaratory-judgment procedure allows the alleged infringer to proactively bring suit to resolve the situation and eliminate the cloud of uncertainty looming overhead.

Common claims for declaratory judgment in patent cases are non-infringement, patent invalidity, and un-enforceability. To bring a claim for declaratory judgment in a situation where a patent dispute may exist or develop, the claimant must establish that an actual controversy exists. If there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality, the court will generally proceed with the declaratory-judgment action. The court may even hear the action if the patentee has not filed a cease and desist letter. The standard for an actual controversy was most recently addressed by the Supreme Court in &quot;MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.&quot;, 549 U.S. 118 (2007). But even if an actual controversy exists, the declaratory-judgment statute is permissive—a district court, in its discretion, may decline to hear a declaratory-judgment action.

Usually the claimant is actually making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing, or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent owner has claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement. An express threat of litigation is not needed, nor is it a guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted. Some factors courts have considered in this analysis are whether a patent owner has asserted its rights against an alleged infringer in a royalty dispute, whether the owner has sued a customer of an alleged infringer, or whether an owner has made statements regarding its patents in trade magazines.

If a patent owner does suggest that there is patent coverage of what an alleged infringer is doing or planning to do, the alleged infringer may bring suit. The alleged infringer, as the plaintiff in the suit, can choose the venue subject to constitutional restrictions and the state long-arm statute of the forum in question. The suit can be brought in any forum if the local federal district court can properly obtain personal jurisdiction over the alleged infringer.

Defendants in infringement cases can ask for declaratory judgment as a counterclaim.

A counterclaim of infringement is a compulsory counterclaim to a claim for declaratory judgment of non-infringement. If a patent owner fails to assert an infringement counterclaim in a declaratory-judgment non-infringement suit, the patent infringement claim will be deemed waived.

<doc id="984655" wikidata="Q4976795" url="?curid=984655" title="Brownsville Revival">
<text>The Brownsville Revival (also known as the Pensacola Outpouring) was a widely reported Christian revival within the Pentecostal movement that began on Father&#x27;s Day June 18, 1995, at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida. Characteristics of the Brownsville Revival movement, as with other Christian religious revivals, included acts of repentance by parishioners and a call to holiness, inspired by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Some of the occurrences in this revival fit the description of moments of religious ecstasy. More than four million people are reported to have attended the revival meetings from its beginnings in 1995 to around 2000.

==Description==
One writer offered this description of the revival in 1998:

== History ==
In 1993, two years before the revival began, Brownsville&#x27;s pastor, John Kilpatrick, began directing his congregation to pray for revival. Over the next two years, he talked constantly about bringing revival to the church, even going as far as to threaten to leave the church if it didn&#x27;t accept the revival. Supporters of the revival would also cite prophecies by Dr. David Yonggi Cho, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church, as evidence that the revival was inspired by God. According to Cho, God told him he was &quot;going to send revival to the seaside city of Pensacola, and it will spread like a fire until all of America has been consumed by it.&quot;

On Father&#x27;s Day June 18, 1995, a Sunday, the revival began, evangelist Steve Hill was the guest speaker, having been invited by Kilpatrick. Later, Hill and Kilpatrick, told of &quot;a mighty wind&quot; that blew through the church, an account that quickly spread across the Pentecostal community. Kilpatrick had been talking &quot;revival&quot; for several months. As the nightly revival meetings continued, Hill canceled all plans to go to Russia, and preached several revival services each week for the next five years.

Hundreds of those who attended services were moved to renew their faith during Hill&#x27;s sermons. In time, the church opened its doors for Tuesday-through-Saturday evening revival services to accommodate the thousands of people who arrived and waited in the church parking lot before dawn for a chance to enter the packed sanctuary, some even camping overnight waiting for the doors to open .

By 1997, it was common to have lengthy and rapturous periods of singing and dancing and altars packed with hundreds of writhing or dead-still bodies from a variety of ages, races and socioeconomic conditions. As the revival progressed, the testimonies of people receiving salvation were joined by testimonies of supernatural healings. In Steve Hill&#x27;s words, &quot;We&#x27;re seeing miraculous healings, cancerous tumors disappear and drug addicts immediately delivered.&quot; However, the church told local news reporters that it did not keep records of the healings. In 1997, the leaders of the revival—Hill, Kilpatrick, and Lindell Cooley (Brownsville&#x27;s worship director)—went to several cities (Anaheim, Dallas, St. Louis, Lake Charles (Louisiana), Toledo, and Birmingham) and held like meetings. They named this ministry &quot;Awake America&quot;.

The primary part of the revival ended in 2000 when Hill moved on to pursue other works. In 2003, Hill founded a church in the Dallas area where he served as senior pastor. After a long bout with cancer, Hill died in March 2014. Cooley left in October 2003. Kilpatrick resigned as senior pastor in 2003 to form an evangelistic association of his own. Until 2006, the church continued to hold special Friday-night services that were a continuation of the revival.

Bob Giovoni attended this with his wife and later became the pastor of Pleasant Grove Baptist Church in Pensacola

== Aftermath ==
During the revival, nearly 200,000 accepted Christianity, and by the Fall of 2000 more than 1,000 people who experienced the revival were enrolled at the Brownsville Revival School of Ministry. Thousands of pastors visited Brownsville and returned to their home congregations, leading to an outbreak of mini-revivals that helped the Assemblies of God recover from what some saw as a denominational decline.

One follow-on revival, often called the Smithton Outpouring, occurred in the small town of Smithton, Missouri, at Smithton Community Church. It was significant because it was not connected with the Assemblies of God. The pastor, Steve Gray, visited the Brownsville Revival in 1996 while in the midst of personal turmoil, returned to his church of 150 members and hosted a 3-year revival which saw about 250,000 visitors. The revival is also significant because the ministry of Steve Gray and a significant number of his followers remain active in Kansas City, where 85% of the congregation moved in 2000. The ministry he pastors, World Revival Church, emphasizes the attitude and mission of revival.

In 2001 there was a mini-split which occurred between the leadership of the Brownville Revival Church and the leadership of the Brownville Revival School of Ministry. This split for many marked the end of the Revival. This led to the creation of The F.I.R.E. School of Ministry (Fellowship for International Revival and Evangelism) under the former leader of B.R.S.M., Dr. Michael Brown. B.R.S.M. continued to offer classes for several years before being merged into a Ministry of Tommy Tenney. As of Sep 2018 the Fire School of Ministry was still operating in Concord NC.

== Criticism ==
The meetings were criticized by some Christians and by the local news media. The &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; ran a series of investigative articles which focused on the donations raised during the meetings and where those funds went, as well as the claims of miraculous healings at the services and the spontaneity of the revival&#x27;s beginnings. The newspaper revealed that a videotape of the Father&#x27;s Day service that sparked the revival showed it was far less dramatic than later claimed.

The &quot;News Journal&quot; began a four-month investigation after former members told reporters that all was not as it appeared at the church. The series won George Polk awards from such groups as National Headliner, the Scripps-Howard Foundation, and the Society of Professional Journalists. Brownsville Assembly of God responded to the paper&#x27;s allegations by publishing a paid advertisement (thus shielding them from a response from the paper) in the &quot;News Journal&quot; entitled, &quot;The Facts of The Brownsville Revival&quot;.

Hank Hanegraaff, a well known cessationist and author of the book &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;, criticized the revival for &quot;serious distortions of biblical Christianity&quot; in the meetings, comparing the physical manifestations to pagan practices.

J Lee Grady, editor for Charisma Magazine, was critical of the division that had grown within the leadership at the last stage of the revival. He also reported that numerous former attendees now attend local Baptist churches.

<text>Dunmanway (, official Irish name: ) is a market town in County Cork, in the southwest of Ireland. It is the geographical centre of the region known as West Cork. It is the birthplace of Sam Maguire, an Irish Protestant republican, for whom the trophy of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is named. The town centre is built on and around two rivers, which are tributaries of the larger River Bandon, which passes by at the east end of the town.

The town is twinned with Quéven, France. Dunmanway won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1982. The town came to national and international attention in 2009 when Liverpool Football Club played a pre-season soccer friendly in the area.

The population of Dunmanway at the 2011 census was 1,585, rising to 1,964 by the 2022 census.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s Irish language name is rendered, among other variations, as or . A number of derivations are given for the meaning and origin of the town&#x27;s name. For example, in &quot;Irish Local Names Explained&quot; (first published in 1870), the historian and etymologist Patrick Weston Joyce gives the meaning as &quot;the fort of the gables (or pinnacles)&quot;. In &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;, published by Samuel Lewis in 1837, it is given as meaning &quot;the castle of the yellow river&quot; or &quot;the castle on the little plain&quot;, referring to a MacCarthy castle in the area. Other sources suggest it means &quot;the fort of the yellow women&quot;.

==History==

Dunmanway has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as testified by a Bronze Age trumpet in the British Museum. From the mid-13th to the late 17th century the surrounding districts of the town of Dunmanway were included in the territory of the MacCarthy Clan.

Dunmanway Castle once stood on a bank of the Sally River on the left-hand side of present-day Castle Street. It was one of the chief residences of the MacCarthy Lords of Gleannacroim, cousins of the MacCarthy Reagh sept. Dating from the late 15th century, the tower house is recorded to have been built by Catherine Fitzgerald. There was likely a small settlement in the environs of the castle.

19th-century references date the founding of Dunmanway to the late 17th century, when the English crown settled a colony there to provide a resting place for troops marching between Bandon and Bantry. By 1700, about thirty families lived in the town.

Sir Richard Cox, Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1703 to 1707, was the town&#x27;s most important early patron. In 1693, Cox obtained a grant from King William III to hold market days and fairs in the town and strongly encouraged the development of the local flax industry. To that end, Cox imported artisans from Ulster to teach the required skills. He sponsored numerous incentives for local residents involved in making linen, including rent-free housing for top producers, bonuses for efficient labourers, rewards for schoolgirls who showed strong loom skills, and production contests with generous prizes. In 1735, the town consisted of forty houses and two to three hundred people. By 1747, the linen industry was well established, and Cox&#x27;s personal census recorded 557 people. Two years later, it rose to 807.

Free market economic policies in England led to the removal of protective duties on linen in 1827. In 1837, Samuel Lewis&#x27;s Topographical Dictionary of Ireland recorded a population of 2,738. It also recorded the town&#x27;s changing economic fortunes:

&quot;The manufacture of linen continued to flourish for some years, but at present there are very few looms at work. A porter and ale brewery, established in 1831, produces 2,600 barrels annually; there are also two tanyards and two boulting-mills, the latter capable of grinding annually 15,000 bags of flour, and there are two or three smaller mills in the vicinity. Since 1810 a considerable trade in corn has been carried on.&quot;

West Cork was hit hard by the 1840s Great Famine. On 9 February 1847, U.S. Vice President George M. Dallas chaired a famine relief meeting in Washington, D.C. where participants heard a letter addressed to the &quot;Ladies of America&quot; from the women of The Dunmanway Indian Meal Ladies&#x27; Committee:

&quot;Oh! that our American sisters could see the labourers on our roads, able-bodied men, scarcely clad, famishing with hunger, with despair in their once cheerful faces, staggering at their work ... oh! that they could see the dead father, mother or child, lying coffinless and hear the screams of the survivors around them, caused not by sorrow, but by the agony of hunger.&quot;

In the early 1850s, following the migrations and evictions which characterized the famine&#x27;s upheavals, more than seventy percent of Dunmanway residents did not own any land.

On 28 November 1920, during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), seventeen British Auxiliary Division troops were killed by the Irish Republican Army at the Kilmichael Ambush (near Dunmanway). The subsequent sacking and burning of the city of Cork by the British forces is thought to be linked to the Kilmichael Ambush. On 15 December 1920, an Auxiliary shot dead the local priest, Canon Magner, for refusing to toll his church&#x27;s bells on Armistice Day; a local boy, Tadhg Crowley, was also killed in an apparently random incident. There were numerous other actions in and around Dunmanway during the war. In addition, after a truce was declared in July 1921, the local IRA killed a number of alleged informers. Controversy continues in particular over the killing of ten men (including three residents of Dunmanway) in the spring of 1922, all of whom were Protestants. These events are sometimes known as the Dunmanway killings.

==Demographics==

As of the 2016 census, the population (of 1,655) included a small number of people from the United Kingdom, Poland, Lithuania and elsewhere within the European Union. The 2016 census returns also indicated that people in Dunmanway were predominantly Roman Catholic. There are also two Protestant denominations in the town, namely the Church of Ireland and Methodism.

As of the 2022 census, the population had grown to 1,964. Of these, approximately 85% were born in Ireland, 6% in the United Kingdom, 3% in Poland, 4% in other EU countries, with less than 2% (39 people) born in other parts of the world.

== Events ==
The Ballabuidhe Festival is held annually over the August Bank Holiday weekend and centres around both the Ballabuidhe Horse Fair and Ballabuidhe Races. The Ballabuidhe Horse Fair dates back to 1615, when King James I granted Randal Óg Hurley a charter to hold a fair at Béal Átha Buidhe on the River Bandon.

The Dunmanway Agricultural Show, first held in 1946, takes place on the first Sunday in July each year, and with contested classes including horses, cattle and horticulture.

The Sam Maguire Festival runs in September, and focuses on the life and ethos of Sam Maguire.

==Sport==

===Gaelic games===
Dohenys is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and the club play their home matches at Sam Maguire Park. Dohenys&#x27; under-age teams play under the name &quot;Sam Maguires&quot;. The club is named in honour of Michael Doheny, a member of the Young Ireland nationalist movement who lived in the area for a short period.

As of 2023, Dohenys were competing in the Cork Senior A Football Championship. The club has produced a number of inter-county players, including Éamonn Young, who captained Cork to victory in the National Football League and the Munster Football Championship in 1952, having also been a part of Cork&#x27;s All-Ireland-winning team of 1945. Although the club has historically had more success in Gaelic football, Dohenys became Munster Junior B Club Hurling Champions in 2006.

===Soccer===
The local soccer club is Dunmanway Town, which plays in the Premier Division of the West Cork League. In 2009, it was announced that Liverpool F.C. had agreed to visit Dunmanway to play the club in a pre-season friendly on 6 August 2009. Liverpool, fielding players from their reserve and youth teams (the home side supplemented their line-up with a number of players from prominent Cork-based clubs like Avondale United and Cobh Ramblers F.C.) won the game by one goal to nil in front of 6,800 fans, and Gardaí estimated that more than 15,000 people visited Dunmanway on the day to catch a glimpse of the Liverpool stars of the future.

=== Angling ===

The stretch of the River Bandon which flows east through Dunmanway holds brown trout, sea trout and salmon.

===Other sports===

Other sports clubs in the town include rugby, athletics, pitch and putt, badminton and volleyball. Dunmanway has also been home to an indoor heated swimming pool for many years, with the 25-metre pool being the only public swimming pool in the West Cork area.

August 2010 saw the revived &quot;Munster 100&quot; motorcycle road race take place in Dunmanway. This was followed two years later by the first Dunmanway &#x27;Lightning Sprint&#x27; Grand Prix motorcycle meet.

Like other parts of County Cork, road bowling events are held in the surrounding area, and the All-Ireland road bowling championships took place in Dunmanway in July 2011.

==Economy==
Between 1975 and 1999, Swedish multinational firm Mölnlycke Health Care operated a manufacturing facility in Dunmanway. The plant employed over 250 people at its peak.

The construction industry and agriculture have also played a role in the economic environment of the town.

==Transport==
Dunmanway is approximately 60 km southwest from Cork City, on the N71 national secondary road, and the R586 regional road. The town is served by Bus Éireann bus service from Cork City. The nearest airport is Cork Airport.

Dunmanway railway station opened on 12 June 1866 and closed entirely on 1 April 1961.

<text>The International Democratic Education Conference (IDEC) is an annual academic and youth conference hosted by a variety of schools and organizations in cities around the world. It is a global gathering of educators, students, parents, and advocates who are interested in democratic education.

== History ==

IDEC was first held in 1993, and has been held in all subsequent years except 2001 . The length of the conferences has varied between two days for the first event and 15 days in 1997. The purpose of each conference has been decided by the school organising it.


Notes:
* &quot;IDEC 2001:&quot; The conference was to be held jointly and co-hosted by the Institute of Democratic Education in Israel and the Hope Flowers School in Palestine, but the international situation reduced it to a comparatively small event, attended mainly by Israelis, Palestinians and Germans; for that situation they was decided to call this conference the &quot;Israeli Democratic Education Conference&quot;.
* &quot;IDEC 2009:&quot; The conference was cancelled due to H1N1
* &quot;IDEC 2012:&quot; For the very first time, the IDEC conference will be held in the Caribbean at Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth (unincorporated territory) of the United States.

<doc id="984668" wikidata="Q7513032" url="?curid=984668" title="Signs and wonders">
<text>Signs and wonders refers to experiences that are perceived to be miraculous as being normative in the modern Christian experience, and is a phrase associated with groups that are a part of modern charismatic movements and Pentecostalism. This phrase is seen multiple times throughout the Bible to describe the activities of the early church, and is historically recorded as continuing, at least in practice, since the time of Christ. The phrase is primarily derived from Old and New Testament references and is now used in the Christian and mainstream press and in scholarly religious discourse to communicate a strong emphasis on recognizing perceived manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the contemporary lives of Christian believers. It also communicates a focus on the expectation that divine action would be experienced in the individual and corporate life of the modern Christian church, and a further insistence that followers actively seek the &quot;gifts of the Spirit&quot;.

A further major emphasis of belief in signs and wonders is that the message of the Christian &quot;good news&quot; is communicated more effectively to those who do not believe it if accompanied by supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit, including such signs and wonders as miraculous healings and modern prophetic proclamations. This is the message of John Wimber&#x27;s book, &quot;Power Evangelism&quot;.

== Biblical origins ==

The origin of the phrase in the Old Testament is in , which describes God&#x27;s actions to free the Israelites from being enslaved in Ancient Egypt. This phrase is used a total of 31 times in the Bible and it became popular again in modern history around the time of the Azusa Street Revival, when attendees claimed miraculous and supernatural events had happened.

== Critical responses ==

Critical responses were made by various writers including: J. Woodhouse, K. L. Sarles, K. M. Bond, and D. H. Shepherd, Later in the 1990s, the discussion was taken up by R. E. Jackson (addressing skeptics), and D. Williams.

Gene Kim argues that signs and wonders are only reserved for the nation of Israel, and in particular, the apostles. There was evidence of signs and wonders fading in the latter days of Paul&#x27;s ministry (Phillipians 2:25–27). The Jews require a sign in order to confirm their apostleship (1 Corinthians 1:22–23).

== Defense and reflection ==

The ongoing theological reflection accompanying the signs and wonders movement was evidenced by Fuller Theological Seminary&#x27;s 1988 Symposium on Power Evangelism and C. Peter Wagner&#x27;s book titled &quot;The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit&quot;. The study of the missiological implications of signs and wonders would continue on into the turn of the century.

Cessationists believe that spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, prophecy and healing ceased with the Apostolic Age, leading to a cessationism versus continuationism debate. The broader debate specifically over the signs and wonders movement and the present-day function of the manifestation gifts would continue into the 1990s.

==Power evangelism==

The term &quot;power evangelism&quot; originally comes from Lonnie Frisbee&#x27;s ministry but some of his harshest critics for heavy use of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit came from the churches he helped found.

Power evangelism is a form of evangelism which relies on the supernatural power and gifts of the Holy Spirit, that is, on signs and wonders, to reach new converts and work through born again Christians. It is not the way most churches practice evangelism currently, which relies on an intellectual argument with the hope of salvation through logic and structured rituals.

<text>Odeon Records is a record label founded in 1903 by Max Straus and Heinrich Zuntz of the International Talking Machine Company in Berlin, Germany. The label&#x27;s name and logo come from the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe in Paris.

== History ==
Straus and Zuntz bought the company from Carl Lindström that he had founded in 1897. They transformed the Lindström enterprise into a public company, the Carl Lindström A.G. and in 1903 purchased Fonotipia Records, including their Odeon-Werke International Talking Machine Company.

International Talking Machine Company issued the Odeon label first in Germany in 1903 and applied for a U.S. trademark the same year. While other companies were making single-side discs, Odeon made them double-sided. In 1909 it created the first recording of a large orchestral work — and what may have been the first record album — when it released a 4-disc set of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Nutcracker Suite with Hermann Finck conducting the London Palace Orchestra.

Between 1910 and 1911 Odeon was acquired by Carl Lindström. On 30 January 1904, Odeon became a part of the Carl Lindström Company, which also owned Beka Records, Parlophone, Fonotipia, Lyrophon, Homophon and other labels. Lindström was acquired by the English Columbia Graphophone Company in 1926. In 1931 Columbia merged with Electrola and other labels to form EMI.

The Berlin Odeon plant recorded, processed, and exported records to many countries. There were extensive national catalogs for some of these countries: Greece, Scandinavia, India, all of Arabia, Netherlands, Estonia, Portugal, South and Central America, Romania, Turkey, Hungary, China, Dutch East Indies, Siam, the Balkan countries etc. In the 1920s and 1930s about 70% of the German Odeon production was exported. Some Odeon recordings were leased to the American Okeh Records for distribution in the United States.

Odeon discs were first manufactured in America, for export only, in 1905 or 1906 by the American Record Company, which produced lateral-cut, 10¾-inch 78 discs made of blue shellac. This business ceased in 1907 when ARC was sued by Columbia for patent infringement. Lindström tried again to open an American branch, this time through Otto Heineman, who worked for Lindström&#x27;s company and was living in America when World War I broke out. Stuck in New York, Heineman created the Otto Heineman Phonograph Supply Company in 1915, then four years later started his own label, Okeh Records.

In 1919, Okeh began issuing foreign recordings in the United States on the Odeon label. During the 1920s, Odeon issued American jazz records in other countries, such as Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. During the 1930s and 1940s Odeon sold its Swing Music Series.

Odeon recorded and issued over 2,700 titles of Indian music from the period 1900–1940.

Odeon&#x27;s shellac disc issues were in two phases: (1) 1912–1916 and (2) 1932–1938. During the first phase their engineers visited many cities to record the diverse regional music of India, and after production in Berlin shipped records back to India. The company was based in Mumbai and Madras during the second phase. However the outbreak of World War II, and the subsequent trade embargoes, meant that the company had to wind-up its operations in India.

The company&#x27;s output included &quot;drama songs, speeches, folk music, classical music, drama sets, skits and plays, vocal and instrumental music&quot;. It has been estimated that about 600 titles have survived in private collections. The British Museum have digitised some of these records which are free in an online archive.

After World War II, the Odeon label continued as an EMI subsidiary in many non-English-speaking markets, such as West Germany, France, Spain, Scandinavia, Japan and Latin America. The dome logo was still used in most of those places, although they also had their own label designs.

With the sale of most EMI properties to erstwhile rival Universal Music Group (UMG) in September 2012, Universal retained the right to reissue from namely Odeon&#x27;s post-war Japanese, Latin American, German and select European catalogues, while another former competitor Warner Music Group (WMG) acquired the rights to the remainder of EMI in February 2013 and with that, reissues from Odeon&#x27;s French, Scandinavian, Spanish and most other European releases, to comply with the European Commission&#x27;s divestiture conditions. Universal Music Enterprises manages UMG&#x27;s Odeon catalogue with Parlophone and WEA International handling WMG&#x27;s own.

In October 2018, Universal Music Germany revived Odeon to release the brass pop band Querbeat&#x27;s third album &quot;Randale &amp; Hurra&quot;.

<text>Bésame Tonto (&quot;Kiss Me, Fool&quot;) is a 2003 Spanish language television soap opera as a joint Peruvian, Ecuadorian and Venezuelan production that received high ratings in Latin American countries as well as Russia, Germany and the Philippines and was filmed in Peru. It first aired on February 10, 2003 and starred Peruvian actress Gianella Neyra and Argentinian actor Segundo Cernadas who were dating in real life at the time. In 2004, Univision aired the soap opera in the United States.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Besame Tonto&quot; is the story of a young woman who does not know that she grew up in a Mafia family and that she is adopted. Her adoptive father is an Italian mafioso who lives and operates a criminal syndicate in Peru. He is an older man who wants to make his businesses legitimate, and he eventually acquires a newspaper, which he in turn will use to attack his most powerful enemy.

&quot;Julieta Rossini&quot;, the young woman, is married to a man against her own wishes. But her real love is &quot;Romulo&quot;, who takes her away from Lima and across northern Peru.

Romulo has characteristics that are somewhat atypical of the love heroes of these types of television shows: he wears glasses, greases his hair and chooses to use overalls or plaid shirts. Rossini, however, becomes attracted to his personality and his intelligence, and she does not want to return to a husband she never loved in the first place. But her father sees
her leaving as a kidnapping by Romulo, and soon, the police are after Romulo and Julieta.

Julieta&#x27;s father, despite knowing that she is not his real daughter, loves her dearly and felt he would hurt her by revealing information to her about his businesses and about her being adopted. For this reason, he keeps those two facts as a secret from her. Her adoptive mother, however, is a woman who is only interested in her husband&#x27;s money, and she tries to instill that desire for money in Juliana&#x27;s personality.

Upon learning, by his own daughter&#x27;s admission to him, that Julieta had fallen in love with Romulo, Mr. Rossini forgives Romulo and actually begins to like him. He eventually gives him non-criminal jobs, such as finding out what his mafia enemies are up to, keeping his finances up to date, etc., etc. When Mr. Rossini becomes injured in an attack, he decides to hide and leaves Lima to live in Peru&#x27;s interior, from where he contacts Romulo to find out how things are going back at home.

Complicating Romulo&#x27;s family life are a sick father who is in his 60s, a stepmother who becomes pregnant, then loses her baby during another attack by Rossini&#x27;s rival gang, and a brother who is more interested in money than anything else.

<text>Gordonvale is a rural sugar-growing town and locality situated on the southern side of Cairns in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Gordonvale had a population of 6,944 people.

At Gordonvale in June 1935, the cane toad was introduced in a failed attempt at controlling the native Frenchi beetle and the greyback cane beetle.

== Geography ==
Gordonvale lies approximately south of the Cairns central business district and is just east of the Gillies Range which leads to the Atherton Tableland.

The locality is bounded to the south-east by the Mulgrave River. The land is generally flat and low-lying (approx above sea level), but on the eastern, southern and western boundaries of the locality the land begins to rise sharply as the locality is surrounded by mountainous terrain formating part of a number of ranges: Islet Hills to the north-west, Lamb Range to the south-west, Bellenden Ker Range to the south, and Thompson Range to the east. The predominant land use in the locality is growing sugarcane.

The town of Gordonvale is on the Mulgrave River and is on the south-eastern edge of the locality. The Mulgrave Sugar Mill is on the western side of the town in Gordon Street.

The Bruce Highway enters the locality from the south-east (Aloomba), bypasses the town centre to the west and then proceeds north to exit to Wrights Creek.

The North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south-east (Aloomba), passes through the town and then travels north through the locality to exit to Wrights Creek. The town is served by the Gordonvale railway station which is located immediately adjacent to the sugar mill. The Kamma railway siding is just prior to the exit to Wrights Creek. The former Meringa railway station in the centre of the locality has been abandoned. There is an extensive network of cane tramways through the locality and beyond that deliver harvested sugarcane to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill.

== History ==
Gordonvale was established on Yidinji tribal land. &quot;Yidinji&quot; (also known as &quot;Yidinj&quot;, &quot;Yidiny&quot;, and &quot;Idindji&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, and the Mulgrave River, and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi.

British settlement began in 1877 with William Saunders Alley and Mr Blackwell and their families who cut a road through to Trinity Inlet so they could haul out cedar logs. It was called &quot;Plain Camp&quot; by Alley.

In the Cairns area, a Chinese businessman, Andrew Leon, built the first sugar mill in 1882, named Pioneer Mill, and established the Hap Wah Plantation on of land.

In 1890, the area became known as &quot;Mulgrave&quot; after the Mulgrave River. In 1896 it was named &quot;Nelson&quot;, named after Queensland Premier Sir Hugh Muir Nelson. However this caused postal confusion with Nelson in New South Wales. On 24 January 1914 the town was officially renamed Gordonvale after John Gordon, a pioneer in the district who was a butcher, dairyman and grazier, and early director of Mulgrave Central sugar mill.

Mulgrave State School opened on 15 March 1897. In 1914 it was renamed Gordonvale State School. On 28 March 1924 it became Gordonvale Rural School. In 1963 a secondary school department was added until a permanent secondary school was established, in 1965. On 1 January 1965 the primary school was renamed back to Gordonvale State School.

On 20 April 1916, the Cane Beetles March commenced at Mooliba (now Mirriwinni). It was a snowball march to recruit men into the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I at a time when enthusiasm to enlist had waned after the loss of life in the Gallipoli campaign. The march began at Mooliba with 4 men, passing through Babinda, Aloomba, Gordonvale, and Edmonton, and ending in Cairns 60 kilometres later with 29 recruits.

St Alphonsus Catholic School was established in Muir Street in 1923 by the Sisters of Mercy. It was officially opened on Sunday 15 April 1923 by Bishop John Heavey. A special excursion train was provided for people wishing to attend the ceremony. In December 1959 it was replaced by the St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and the former school building became a parish hall. The Sisters of Mercy ended their involvement with the school in 1990 and it now operates under lay leadership.

Little Mulgrave State School opened on 26 July 1926 and closed on 21 February 1964.

On Sunday 15 July 1934, the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Filippo Bernardini laid the foundation stone for a new Catholic Church. On Sunday 27 January 1935 Bishop John Heavey officially opened and blessed the new church. The Gordonvale parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1935.

Cane toads (&quot;Bufo marinus&quot;) were deliberately introduced into Australia in an attempt to control the native Frenchi beetle (&quot;Lepidiota frenchi&quot;) and the greyback cane beetle (&quot;Dermolepida albohirtum&quot;) whose larvae (colloquially known as &quot;cane grubs&quot;) were destroying sugar cane crops in North Queensland. In June 1935 the Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations imported 102 cane toads (&quot;Bufo marinus&quot;) into Gordonvale from Hawaii in June 1935 (with one dying in transit due to dehydration) in the belief that the toads would eat the cane beetles, a pest in the sugarcane industry. By March 1937 some 62,000 toadlets had been bred and distributed into sugar cane fields up and down the Queensland coast. The experiment did not work and the toads have spread throughout much of Australia.

During World War II, a contingent of approximately 3,000 American paratroopers was stationed in Gordonvale and did their training there for their missions in New Guinea. The American Army commandeered some of the town&#x27;s hotels to use as hospitals as many troops were injured during this training. Quite a number of local women were employed to do parachute packing.

The first Gordonvale Fire Station opened in 1950 at 105 Norman Street (). The new Gordonvale Fire Station on Gillies Range Road was completed in 2017. The new site was chosen to provide better access to both the Bruce Highway and the Gillies Highway.

The Gordonvale Library opened on 19 February 1954, replacing the old School of Arts which was built in 1900.

All Saints&#x27; Anglican Church was consecrated on 14 June 1963 by Anglican Bishop of North Queensland Ian Shevill and Anglican Archbishop of Sydney Hugh Gough. It was designed by Cairns architects Sidney George Barnes and Edwin Oribin.

On 26 October 1964 Senior Constable Desmond Trannore was shot attending a domestic disturbance.

In the 1990s, a number of mosaics were commissioned by the &quot;Friends of Gordonvale&quot; commemorating through imagery the original businesses and shops in the town. These mosaics were cemented permanently within the footpaths directly outside the original sites of the businesses.

Gordonvale was located within the Shire of Mulgrave until its amalgamation with the City of Cairns in 1995. The City was subsequently merged into the larger Cairns Region in 2008.

In 2012, the new Gordonvale Ambulance Station opened. It replaced the old ambulance station built in 1916 at 1 Cannon Street (). The old ambulance building was sold on 8 October 2013 for $405,000.

On 27 October 2014, the Cairns Seventh Day Adventist School moved to purpose-built premises in Gordonvale and was renamed Cairns Adventist College. It originally opened as a primary school on 6 February 1950 in the Cairns CBD. It later moved to premises at the Cairns Seventh Day Adventist Church at 302 Gatton Street, Manunda.
On 22 November 2018 the new Gordonvale Police Station was officially opened on Draper Road by Police Minister Mark Ryan and Police Commissioner Ian Stewart. The new police station cost $4.5 million and was built to serve the growing population in the corridor south of Cairns. It features Indigenous artwork &quot;Looking to the Stars&quot; by Gilimbaa artist Jenna Lee of the Larrakia people. The previous police station was in Cannon Street ().

<text>Territorial spirits are national angels, or demons who rule over certain geographical areas in the world, a concept accepted within the Charismatic movement, Pentecostalism, and Dominionist Kingdom Now theology. This belief has been popularized by the novel &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; by Frank E. Peretti as well as by the ministry of C. Peter Wagner and the related New Apostolic Reformation. The existence of territorial spirits is viewed as significant in spiritual warfare within these Christian groups. Related is the belief in spiritual mapping in order to locate these demonically controlled regions.

==Biblical context==
===Deuteronomy 32:8-9===
In both the Septuagint and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Deuteronomy 32:8-9 refers to a time when God divided the nations of the earth among the &quot;sons of God&quot; (Israel is excepted as the special possession of God Himself.) Given the meaning of this phrase in the Book of Job, it is suggested that this is a reference to the origin of territorial spirits who were, at one time, angels administering the earth on God&#x27;s behalf. Wagner appeals to F. F. Bruce, who points out that the Septuagint reading &quot;implies that the administration of various nations has been parceled out among a corresponding number of angelic powers.&quot; The question remains, however, as to whether these spirits are malevolent.

===Psalm 82===
Psalm 82 speaks of &quot;elohim&quot; who are &quot;sons of the most High&quot; and are assigned to judge mankind until dying like men or &quot;falling like one of the princes&quot;. Psalm 58 covers similar ground.

===Daniel 10===
Daniel 10 concerns the visitation of a man &quot;His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude&quot; to the prophet Daniel. This man explains to Daniel that he was delayed by the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (10:13), but was helped by &quot;Michael, one of the chief princes&quot; (a reference to the Michael the Archangel, who was recognized in Jewish literature to be a chief angel guarding over Israel). Later in the chapter, the man warns Daniel that soon the &quot;Prince of Greece&quot; (10:20) will join his Persian counterpart to make war upon them.

Wagner regards this chapter as a key passage supporting the existence of territorial spirits, and appeals to Keil and Delitzsch, who suggest that the &quot;prince of Persia&quot; is the &quot;guardian spirit of the kingdom.&quot; George Otis, coiner of the term &quot;spiritual mapping&quot;, says that Daniel 10 is &quot;a well-defined case of an evil spiritual being ruling over an area with explicitly defined boundaries.&quot; David E. Stevens notes that many scholars take the Prince of Persia to be an earthly political authority, such as Cambyses II. Stevens personally accepts the angelic interpretation, but argues that the &quot;influence exerted by these angelic princes is personal and sociopolitical in nature and not territorial.&quot; Stevens notes that in Daniel 12:1, Michael the Archangel, is described as &quot;the great prince who protects your people&quot; (NIV), which &quot;emphasizes the protective role of Michael in relation to the people of God rather than with respect to a given territory. Michael remained the guardian angel of the people of God, whether Israel was in the Promised Land or was dispersed in exile among the nations.&quot;

== Usage ==
Territorial spirits are a part of strategic-level spiritual warfare (SLSW) as promoted by New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) leader C. Peter Wagner and others in the movement, which involves the practice of mapping the spiritual and social history of an area in order for prophets to learn the names and assignments of demonic spirits as the first step to effective spiritual warfare. Named demons include Jezebel, Baal, and Leviathan.

The American ReAwaken America Tour was originally a COVID-19 protest, which later became &quot;a rolling Chautauqua-style celebration of the spiritual side of Trumpism&quot; sponsored by Charismatic organizations and featuring NAR speakers. The events took on a spiritual warfare tone including references to territorial spirits; in 2022 pastor Mark Burns spoke of &quot;demonic territory that&#x27;s over the land&quot; and Roger Stone mentioned a &quot;Satanic portal [appearing] above the White House&quot; after President Joe Biden took office, stating that it &quot;must be closed. And it will be closed by prayer.&quot;

==Criticism==
Melvin Tinker argues that the literary use of &quot;territorial&quot; &quot;spirits&quot; is a misnomer, since spirits referred to in various Biblical passages &quot;are to be more associated with political and religious power and ideologies.&quot; Opponents of the theological construct of strategic-level spiritual warfare and associated beliefs point out that while the Bible may describe some form of demonic control over geography, it does not prescribe many of the behaviors and teachings that proponents advocate in response.

Scholars such as Robert Priest, Paul Hiebert and A. Scott Moreau, as well as missionary and anthropologist Charles H. Kraft detect animist ideas in the arguments of supporters of the theory of territorial spirits. Robert Guelich of Fuller Theological Seminary does not find the concept of territorial spirits within the Gospels, and has analyzed this problem in a critical review of Frank E. Peretti&#x27;s novel &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;. Peretti&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot;, also features these themes.

<text>Gerald Michael Butts (born July 8, 1971) is a Canadian executive and former policy advisor to governments and political leaders. He served as the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from November 4, 2015 until his resignation on February 18, 2019. From 2008 to 2012, he was president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund Canada, part of a global conservation organization. In 2014, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine declared Butts to be the fourteenth most powerful Canadian. As the former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Butts was praised as the architect behind the Liberal Party of Canada platform that led to its victory in October 2015 and was one of the most senior staffers in the Office of the Prime Minister.

Born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, with three older brothers and one older sister. He is the son of Charles William &quot;Charlie&quot; Butts, a coal miner who was 56 years old when Butts was born and retired when Butts was 6 years old, and Rita Monica (Yorke) Butts, a nurse and a first-generation Canadian daughter of a Ukrainian father and a Polish mother. He attended Bridgeport School (now closed) and then St. Michael&#x27;s High School (now closed).

He received a B.A. and M.A. in English literature from McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. It was at McGill that he was introduced to Justin Trudeau by a mutual friend. There, he was also elected president of the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate and won the national debating championships two years in a row. He briefly attended York University to pursue a Ph.D.

==Career==
Upon graduating from McGill University, his first job was working as a research assistant in the Senate office of Allan MacEachen. There, he helped organize MacEachen&#x27;s past correspondence for the purposes of his intended memoirs (which in the event were never written).

In 1999, Butts became a policy director within the Government of Ontario. He was the policy secretary, and later the principal secretary, in the office of the then premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty, in Toronto. Prior to the 2007 election, Butts was a McGuinty insider. After the election, he became McGuinty&#x27;s principal adviser. As one of his biographical notes describes it, Butts &quot;was intimately involved in all of the government’s significant environmental initiatives, from the Greenbelt and Boreal Conservation plan to the coal phase-out and toxic reduction strategy&quot;.

Butts had previously worked with Senator Allan MacEachen and with George Smitherman.

Butts advised the campaigns that led to the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s election victories in 2003 and 2007.

On June 25, 2008, Butts was announced as the president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund Canada. He officially took up the position on September 2, 2008, succeeding Mike Russill.

On October 16, 2012, Butts left WWF Canada to become the political advisor to Justin Trudeau. His position at WWF Canada was filled by David Miller, a former mayor of Toronto.

On December 13, 2012, Butts was interviewed by Steve Paikin for &quot;The Agenda&quot; on the topic of &quot;The Best Way to Clean Up the Environment&quot;. Butts has published articles in the &quot;Boston Book Review&quot;, the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot;, and &quot;Gravitas&quot;. He has also appeared on television programs such as &quot;W5&quot; and TSN&#x27;s &quot;Off the Record&quot;.

===2015 Canadian election and premiership of Justin Trudeau===

In 2012, stemming from a two-decade-long friendship, Butts became the senior political adviser to Justin Trudeau and one of the few people with whom Trudeau consulted regularly. During Trudeau&#x27;s initial time as Liberal Party leader. He also assisted on the vast majority of policies on which Trudeau campaigned. He was appointed Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister on November 4, 2015.
On September 21, 2016, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Butts had charged moving expenses to Canadian taxpayers in the amount of $126,669.56 to relocate his residence from Toronto to Ottawa. These expenses included a personalized cash payout of $20,799.10. After it was revealed publicly, Butts agreed to repay $41,618.62.

On February 18, 2019, Butts stepped down as Trudeau&#x27;s principal secretary and stated that it was to defend himself from allegations made against him in relation to the SNC-Lavalin affair and to avoid drawing attention away from the prime minister&#x27;s work. In a statement released on Twitter, Butts denied influencing the Attorney General and noted that he specifically recruited Jody Wilson-Raybould to join the Liberal Party of Canada and was an avid supporter during both her candidacy and her tenure as a minister. Butts reiterated these claims in testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on March 6, 2019. At the time of Butts&#x27; resignation, Trudeau had responded by thanking him for his service, while acknowledging the integrity, guidance, and devotion that Butts had provided him. In July 2019, Prime Minister Trudeau hired Butts back to play a key role in the Liberal 2019 election campaign.

==Personal life==
Butts is the nephew of the former Canadian senator Mary Alice &quot;Peggy&quot; Butts, whom he cites as a major influence on him.

He is married to Jodi (Heimpel) Butts, a lawyer, and they have two children, Aidan Ignatius (born May 6, 2006) and Ava Augusta (born December 1, 2007). They resided in Toronto for 13 years until the family relocated in the summer of 2016 to Ottawa. Butts currently resides at Champlain Park area of Westboro, Ottawa.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Computational sociology is a branch of sociology that uses computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena. Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, complex statistical methods, and analytic approaches like social network analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions.

It involves the understanding of social agents, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate. Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence. Some of the approaches that originated in this field have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science.

In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity. Social complexity concepts such as complex systems, non-linear interconnection among macro and micro process, and emergence, have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology. A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an &quot;artificial society&quot;, by which researchers can analyze the structure of a social system.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==History==

=== Background ===

In the past four decades, computational sociology has been introduced and gaining popularity . This has been used primarily for modeling or building explanations of social processes and are depending on the emergence of complex behavior from simple activities. The idea behind emergence is that properties of any bigger system do not always have to be properties of the components that the system is made of. Alexander, Morgan, and Broad, classical emergentists, introduced the idea of emergence in the early 20th century. The aim of this method was to find a good enough accommodation between two different and extreme ontologies, which were reductionist materialism and dualism. 

While emergence has had a valuable and important role with the foundation of Computational Sociology, there are those who do not necessarily agree. One major leader in the field, Epstein, doubted the use because there were aspects that are unexplainable. Epstein put up a claim against emergentism, in which he says it &quot;is precisely the generative sufficiency of the parts that constitutes the whole&#x27;s explanation&quot;.

Agent-based models have had a historical influence on Computational Sociology. These models first came around in the 1960s, and were used to simulate control and feedback processes in organizations, cities, etc. During the 1970s, the application introduced the use of individuals as the main units for the analyses and used bottom-up strategies for modeling behaviors. The last wave occurred in the 1980s. At this time, the models were still bottom-up; the only difference is that the agents interact interdependently.

===Systems theory and structural functionalism===

In the post-war era, Vannevar Bush&#x27;s differential analyser, John von Neumann&#x27;s cellular automata, Norbert Wiener&#x27;s cybernetics, and Claude Shannon&#x27;s information theory became influential paradigms for modeling and understanding complexity in technical systems. In response, scientists in disciplines such as physics, biology, electronics, and economics began to articulate a general theory of systems in which all natural and physical phenomena are manifestations of interrelated elements in a system that has common patterns and properties. Following Émile Durkheim&#x27;s call to analyze complex modern society &quot;sui generis&quot;, post-war structural functionalist sociologists such as Talcott Parsons seized upon these theories of systematic and hierarchical interaction among constituent components to attempt to generate grand unified sociological theories, such as the AGIL paradigm. Sociologists such as George Homans argued that sociological theories should be formalized into hierarchical structures of propositions and precise terminology from which other propositions and hypotheses could be derived and operationalized into empirical studies. Because computer algorithms and programs had been used as early as 1956 to test and validate mathematical theorems, such as the four color theorem, some scholars anticipated that similar computational approaches could &quot;solve&quot; and &quot;prove&quot; analogously formalized problems and theorems of social structures and dynamics.

===Macrosimulation and microsimulation===

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists used increasingly available computing technology to perform macro-simulations of control and feedback processes in organizations, industries, cities, and global populations. These models used differential equations to predict population distributions as holistic functions of other systematic factors such as inventory control, urban traffic, migration, and disease transmission. Although simulations of social systems received substantial attention in the mid-1970s after the Club of Rome published reports predicting that policies promoting exponential economic growth would eventually bring global environmental catastrophe, the inconvenient conclusions led many authors to seek to discredit the models, attempting to make the researchers themselves appear unscientific. Hoping to avoid the same fate, many social scientists turned their attention toward micro-simulation models to make forecasts and study policy effects by modeling aggregate changes in state of individual-level entities rather than the changes in distribution at the population level. However, these micro-simulation models did not permit individuals to interact or adapt and were not intended for basic theoretical research.

===Cellular automata and agent-based modeling===

The 1970s and 1980s were also a time when physicists and mathematicians were attempting to model and analyze how simple component units, such as atoms, give rise to global properties, such as complex material properties at low temperatures, in magnetic materials, and within turbulent flows. Using cellular automata, scientists were able to specify systems consisting of a grid of cells in which each cell only occupied some finite states and changes between states were solely governed by the states of immediate neighbors. Along with advances in artificial intelligence and microcomputer power, these methods contributed to the development of &quot;chaos theory&quot; and &quot;complexity theory&quot; which, in turn, renewed interest in understanding complex physical and social systems across disciplinary boundaries. Research organizations explicitly dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complexity were also founded in this era: the Santa Fe Institute was established in 1984 by scientists based at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the BACH group at the University of Michigan likewise started in the mid-1980s.

This cellular automata paradigm gave rise to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized bottom-up designs but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior. Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development. In 1981, mathematician and political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton published a major paper in &quot;Science&quot; titled &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot; which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest. Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner&#x27;s previous action were able to develop &quot;norms&quot; of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation. Throughout the 1990s, scholars like William Sims Bainbridge, Kathleen Carley, Michael Macy, and John Skvoretz developed multi-agent-based models of generalized reciprocity, prejudice, social influence, and organizational information processing (psychology). In 1999, Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: &quot;Simulation for the social scientist&quot; and established its most relevant journal: the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation.

===Data mining and social network analysis===

Independent from developments in computational models of social systems, social network analysis emerged in the 1970s and 1980s from advances in graph theory, statistics, and studies of social structure as a distinct analytical method and was articulated and employed by sociologists like James S. Coleman, Harrison White, Linton Freeman, J. Clyde Mitchell, Mark Granovetter, Ronald Burt, and Barry Wellman. The increasing pervasiveness of computing and telecommunication technologies throughout the 1980s and 1990s demanded analytical techniques, such as network analysis and multilevel modeling, that could scale to increasingly complex and large data sets. The most recent wave of computational sociology, rather than employing simulations, uses network analysis and advanced statistical techniques to analyze large-scale computer databases of electronic proxies for behavioral data. Electronic records such as email and instant message records, hyperlinks on the World Wide Web, mobile phone usage, and discussion on Usenet allow social scientists to directly observe and analyze social behavior at multiple points in time and multiple levels of analysis without the constraints of traditional empirical methods such as interviews, participant observation, or survey instruments. Continued improvements in machine learning algorithms likewise have permitted social scientists and entrepreneurs to use novel techniques to identify latent and meaningful patterns of social interaction and evolution in large electronic datasets.
The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, 
turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.

===Computational content analysis===
Content analysis has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a &quot;big data&quot; revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. Gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents. The analysis of readability, gender bias and topic bias was demonstrated in Flaounas et al. showing how different topics have different gender biases and levels of readability; the possibility to detect mood shifts in a vast population by analysing Twitter content was demonstrated as well.

The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has been pioneered by Dzogang et al., which showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers. A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.

==Challenges==
Computational sociology, as with any field of study, faces a set of challenges. These challenges need to be handled meaningfully so as to make the maximum impact on society.

===Levels and their interactions===
Each society that is formed tends to be in one level or the other and there exists tendencies of interactions between and across these levels. Levels need not only be micro-level or macro-level in nature. There can be intermediate levels in which a society exists say - groups, networks, communities etc.

The question however arises as to how to identify these levels and how they come into existence? And once they are in existence how do they interact within themselves and with other levels?

If we view entities (agents) as nodes and the connections between them as the edges, we see the formation of networks. The connections in these networks do not come about based on just objective relationships between the entities, rather they are decided upon by factors chosen by the participating entities. The challenge with this process is that, it is difficult to identify when a set of entities will form a network. These networks may be of trust networks, co-operation networks, dependence networks etc. There have been cases where heterogeneous set of entities have shown to form strong and meaningful networks among themselves.

As discussed previously, societies fall into levels and in one such level, the individual level, a micro-macro link refers to the interactions which create higher-levels. There are a set of questions that needs to be answered regarding these Micro-Macro links. How they are formed? When do they converge? What is the feedback pushed to the lower levels and how are they pushed?

Another major challenge in this category concerns the validity of information and their sources. In recent years there has been a boom in information gathering and processing. However, little attention was paid to the spread of false information between the societies. Tracing back the sources and finding ownership of such information is difficult.

===Culture modeling===
The evolution of the networks and levels in the society brings about cultural diversity. A thought which arises however is that, when people tend to interact and become more accepting of other cultures and beliefs, how is it that diversity still persists? Why is there no convergence? A major challenge is how to model these diversities. Are there external factors like mass media, locality of societies etc. which influence the evolution or persistence of cultural diversities?

===Experimentation and evaluation===
Any study or modelling when combined with experimentation needs to be able to address the questions being asked. Computational social science deals with large scale data and the challenge becomes much more evident as the scale grows. How would one design informative simulations on a large scale? And even if a large scale simulation is brought up, how is the evaluation supposed to be performed?

===Model choice and model complexities===
Another challenge is identifying the models that would best fit the data and the complexities of these models. These models would help us predict how societies might evolve over time and provide possible explanations on how things work.

====Generative models====
Generative models helps us to perform extensive qualitative analysis in a controlled fashion. A model proposed by Epstein, is the agent-based simulation, which talks about identifying an initial set of heterogeneous entities (agents) and observe their evolution and growth based on simple local rules.

But what are these local rules? How does one identify them for a set of heterogeneous agents? Evaluation and impact of these rules state a whole new set of difficulties.

====Heterogeneous or ensemble models====
Integrating simple models which perform better on individual tasks to form a Hybrid model is an approach that can be looked into. These models can offer better performance and understanding of the data. However the trade-off of identifying and having a deep understanding of the interactions between these simple models arises when one needs to come up with one combined, well performing model. Also, coming up with tools and applications to help analyse and visualize the data based on these hybrid models is another added challenge.

==Impact==
Computational sociology can bring impacts to science, technology and society.

===Impact on science===
In order for the study of computational sociology to be effective, there has to be valuable innovations. These innovation can be of the form of new data analytics tools, better models and algorithms. The advent of such innovation will be a boom for the scientific community in large. 

===Impact on society===
One of the major challenges of computational sociology is the modelling of social processes . Various law and policy makers would be able to see efficient and effective paths to issue new guidelines and the mass in general would be able to evaluate and gain fair understanding of the options presented in front of them enabling an open and well balanced decision process. .

<text>Gordon Donald Fee (May 23, 1934 – October 25, 2022) was an American-Canadian Christian theologian who was an ordained minister of the Assemblies of God (USA). He was professor of New Testament Studies at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==Biography==
Fee was born in 1934 in Ashland, Oregon, to Donald Horace Fee (1907–1999) and Gracy Irene Jacobson (1906–1979). His father was an Assemblies of God minister who pastored several churches in Washington state. Fee received his BA and MA degrees from Seattle Pacific University and his PhD from the University of Southern California where he wrote his dissertation on the Papyrus 66. On April 21, 2010, Fee was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Northwest University in Kirkland, Washington, where Fee had taught in the past and where a building is named for his father, Donald Fee. After teaching briefly at Wheaton College in Illinois and for several years at Vanguard University of Southern California, Fee taught at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, from fall 1974 until 1986. He then moved to Regent College where he was Professor of New Testament until his retirement in 2009.

Fee was considered a leading expert in pneumatology and textual criticism of the New Testament. He was also the author of books on biblical exegesis, including the popular introductory work &quot;How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth&quot; (co-authored with Douglas Stuart), the &quot;sequel,&quot; &quot;How to Read the Bible, Book by Book&quot;, &quot;How to Choose a Translation for all its Worth&quot; (co-authored with Mark L. Strauss), and a major commentary on 1 Corinthians, as well as numerous other commentaries on various books in the New Testament. In the 1990s, he succeeded F.F. Bruce to become the editor of the notable evangelical commentary series, the &quot;New International Commentary on the New Testament&quot; of which his commentaries on 1 Corinthians and Philippians are a part.

Fee was a member of the CBT (Committee on Bible Translation) that translated the &quot;New International Version&quot; (NIV) and its revision, the &quot;Today&#x27;s New International Version&quot; (TNIV). He also served on the advisory board of the International Institute for Christian Studies.

He discovered that Codex Sinaiticus in Gospel of John 1:1–8:38 and in some other parts of this Gospel does not represent the Alexandrian text-type but the Western text-type.

In 2012, Fee announced that he was retiring as general editor of the New International Commentary on the New Testament series due to the fact that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on October 25, 2022, at his home in New York City, aged 88.

==Views==

===Christian egalitarianism===
Fee was a Christian egalitarian and was a contributing editor to the key Christian egalitarian book &quot;Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity without hierarchy&quot; (2004). His above mentioned commentary consistently translates the generic &quot;men&quot; as &quot;men and women&quot; with an explanatory footnote. He was also a member of the board of reference for Christians for Biblical Equality, a group of Evangelical Christians who believe the Bible teaches complete equality between men and women and that all Christians, regardless of gender &quot;must exercise their God-given gifts with equal authority and equal responsibility in church, home and world&quot;.

===Pentecostal distinctives===
Fee was a Pentecostal; nevertheless, he disagreed with some long held and deeply cherished Pentecostal beliefs. Specifically, he questioned article 7 of the Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths, which articulates a classical Pentecostal understanding of baptism in the Holy Spirit as subsequent to and separate from Christian conversion. In &quot;Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Issue of Separability and Subsequence&quot;, Fee writes that there is little biblical evidence to prove the traditional Pentecostal doctrinal position.

On the other hand, he maintained that &quot;the Pentecostal experience itself can be defended on exegetical grounds as a thoroughly biblical phenomenon&quot;. Fee believed that in the early church, the Pentecostal experience was an expected part of conversion:

Fee believed the Spirit&#x27;s empowerment is a necessary element in the life of the Church that has too often been neglected. It is this neglect, Fee argued, that led early Pentecostals to seek the presence and power of the Spirit in experiences which they identified as baptism in the Holy Spirit.

===Opposition to prosperity theology===
Fee was a strong opponent of the prosperity gospel and published a 1985 book entitled &quot;The Disease of the Health and Wealth Gospels&quot;.

<text>The Lwów Uprising () was an armed insurrection by the Home Army () underground forces of the Polish resistance movement in World War II against the Nazi German occupation of the city of Lviv in the latter stages of World War II. It began on 23 July 1944 as part of a secret plan to launch the countrywide all-national uprising codenamed Operation Tempest ahead of the Soviet advance on the Eastern Front. The Lwów uprising lasted until 27 July. Shortly afterwards, the Polish troops were disarmed, officers were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and ordinary soldiers either arrested or conscripted into the Soviet-created and controlled People’s Army of Poland (LWP) under Red Army command (and strict NKVD political control). Some were forced to join the Red Army, others sent to the Gulag camps. The city itself was occupied by the Soviet Union.

==Background==
In late December 1943, the Red Army initiated yet another offensive upon the 1939 territory of Poland. Already on 4 January 1944, the first Soviet units crossed the pre-war Polish border in Volhynia. By the end of March, most of Tarnopol Voivodeship lay in their hands, with the Germans preparing to retreat behind the Bug River. Under such circumstances, the Home Army devised a plan of a gradual uprising that was to break out before the advancing Soviets, defeat the withdrawing German troops, and allow the underground Polish authorities to appear in newly liberated areas as their legitimate governors. The plan, code-named Operation Tempest, was put into action. By early July 1944, the local Lwów Home Army division of the Jazłowiec Uhlans (&quot;Ułani Jazłowieccy&quot;) prepared specific orders for all Polish partisan units in the area.

According to the order of 5 July 1944, the forces of the Home Army within the city were divided into five districts, each with its own centre of mobilization and different tasks. On 18 July the German civilian authorities and Nazi-organized Ukrainian Auxiliary Police withdrew from the city. The following day, the forces of the Wehrmacht left Lwów, leaving only a token force. This left large parts of the town practically in Polish hands. However, at the same time, several new divisions of the Wehrmacht appeared at the city&#x27;s outskirts, causing the Polish headquarters to postpone the uprising. It was not until the afternoon of 21 July that the first reconnaissance units of the Red Army arrived at the area.

==The uprising==

Soviet 29th Tank Brigade of the 4th Tank Army under Lt. Gen. Lelushenko reached the city&#x27;s limits on 22 July 1944. At that moment, the Polish Home Army decided to commence the battle against German fortified outposts throughout Lwów.

The German forces relocated from the outskirts of the city&#x27;s and fortified themselves in the city centre. In the early hours of the following day, what started as a series of skirmishes resulted in an outbreak of heavy urban warfare. The first to join the fight was the 14th Home Army Uhlan Regiment of foot, clearing the suburb of Łyczaków and pushing towards the old town along Zielona and Łyczakowska streets. In the western area, the Polish forces outnumbered the Germans and were able to capture the Main Train Station terminal. The southern area was almost abandoned by the Germans and the Polish forces were able to capture the 19th century citadel with large military supply depots. This success allowed the supply of the Polish troops with badly needed arms.

On 23 July the heaviest fighting ensued in the city centre and the northern district, where the Poles were able to capture only the Gas Works, preventing their demolition by the German troops. In the city centre, the partisans were aided by the entire Soviet 10th Tank Corps, which was gradually joining the fight. The Soviets advanced in three wedges. One of them aimed at the southern area, already cleared from any German resistance by the Polish units. The two others reinforced the Polish units attacking along the Zielona and Łyczakowska streets. By the end of the day, the last column reached the Old Town Square and the Poles captured the Old Town Market.

Afterwards, the civil and military authorities were summoned for a meeting with Red Army commanders and captured by the NKVD with guarantees of safety for all attendees provided. Despite these guarantees, the Soviets arrested some 5000 Polish soldiers who were sent to &quot;Miedniki&quot; gulag. The remaining forces of Col. Władysław Filipkowski were forcibly conscripted to the Red Army, sent to the Gulag or escaped to rejoin the underground.

<doc id="984709" wikidata="Q1065260" url="?curid=984709" title="Charles La Trobe">
<text>Charles Joseph La Trobe (20 March 18014 December 1875), commonly Latrobe, was appointed in 1839 superintendent of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales and, after the establishment in 1851 of the colony of Victoria (now a state of Australia), he became its first lieutenant-governor.

La Trobe was a strong supporter of religious, cultural and educational institutions. During his time as superintendent and lieutenant-governor he oversaw the establishment of the Botanic Gardens, and provided leadership and support to the formation of entities such as the Mechanic&#x27;s Institute, the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Royal Philharmonic, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the University of Melbourne.

La Trobe was the nephew of British architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe.

==Early life==
Charles La Trobe was born in London, the son of Christian Ignatius Latrobe, a leader of the Moravian Church, from a family of French Huguenot descent, whose mother was a member of the Moravian Church born in the United States. He was educated in England and later spent time in Switzerland and was active in mountaineering; he made a number of ascents in the Alps 1824–26. La Trobe wrote several travel books describing his experiences: &quot;The Alpenstock: Or Sketches of Swiss Scenery and Manners&quot; (1829) and &quot;The Pedestrian: A Summer&#x27;s Ramble in the Tyrol&quot; (1832). Charles&#x27;s uncle (Christian&#x27;s brother) was the British-American &quot;father of American architecture&quot; Benjamin Henry Latrobe who designed the White House porticos.

In 1832, he visited the United States along with Count Albert Pourtales and, in 1834, travelled from New Orleans to Mexico with Washington Irving. He then wrote &quot;The Rambler in North America&quot; (1835) and &quot;The Rambler in Mexico&quot; (1836).

On 16 September 1835, he married Sophie de Montmollin (1809–1854) in Berne, Switzerland. Their first child, Agnes Louisa de La Trobe, was born in Switzerland on 2 April 1837.

==Lieutenant-governor==
In 1837, La Trobe was entrusted with a government commission in the West Indies and reported on the future education of the recently emancipated slaves.

On 4 February 1839, he was appointed superintendent of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, even though he had little managerial and administrative experience. With his wife and 2-year-old daughter, La Trobe sailed into Sydney on 26 July 1839, for training on procedures. The La Trobes went on to Melbourne on 1 October.

At auction, La Trobe bought of land on the fringe of the city, in what is now called Jolimont, at the of £20 an acre, Melbourne residents having agreed among themselves not to bid against the superintendent. Governor George Gipps was disturbed when he heard about it, but La Trobe convinced him that he had acted innocently. On that land, La Trobe erected his home, which he had transported from London in sections, and which is preserved as LaTrobe&#x27;s Cottage.
Melbourne had a population of around 3,000 at the time and was rapidly expanding. La Trobe commenced works to improve sanitation and streets. As the Port Phillip District was a dependency of New South Wales, all land sales, building plans and officer appointments had to be approved by Gipps, with whom La Trobe had a good personal and working relationship.


A Separation Association had been formed in 1840, with the aim of making the Port Phillip District a separate colony. In 1841, La Trobe wrote to Gipps, asking him to visit Melbourne to form his own opinion on the separation question. La Trobe did not actively campaign for separation, being content that Earl Grey had included separation in the reorganisation plan for the colonies. La Trobe also acted as lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land for four months in 1846–47.

In July 1851, the Port Phillip achieved separation from New South Wales, becoming the colony of Victoria, and La Trobe became lieutenant-governor – a position he held until 1854. Soon after separation, gold was discovered at several locations in Victoria. La Trobe suddenly had to deal with the mass exodus of the population of Melbourne to the gold fields, as well as the later arrival of thousands of immigrants from other Australian colonies and overseas.

He was commonly referred to as &quot;Charley Joe&quot;, and by extension, any government officials or policemen were called &quot;joes&quot;. Having tried, with varying degrees of success, to cope with the enormous population and economic expansion of the new colony, La Trobe, who suffered self-doubt and criticism due to his inexperience, submitted his resignation in December 1852, but had to wait until a replacement, Charles Hotham, could take his place.

==After Victoria==
Towards the end of his governorship, La Trobe&#x27;s wife, Sophie, became ill and returned to Europe with their four children. She died on 30 January 1854. On his return to Europe after his term, La Trobe married Sophie&#x27;s sister, Rose Isabelle de Meuron (1821–1883) in 1855, a marriage which was illegal in English law, being considered incestuous at the time. (See Deceased Wife&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Marriage Act 1907.) The couple had two daughters (born 1856 and 1859) in Switzerland and moved to England in 1861. La Trobe did not receive any further British government appointments. His eyesight was increasingly deteriorating, and he was completely blind for the last years of his life. He died in 1875.

==Geelong keys==
La Trobe is also linked to the discovery of a minor piece of evidence suggesting early European exploration of Australia. In 1847, at Limeburners&#x27; Point near Geelong, Victoria, Charles La Trobe, a keen amateur geologist, was examining the shells from a lime kiln when a worker showed him a set of five keys that he claimed to have found, subsequently named the Geelong Keys. La Trobe concluded that, based on their appearance, the keys were dropped onto the beach around 100 to 150 years beforehand (i.e. between 1700 and 1750). In 1977, Kenneth McIntyre hypothesized they were dropped by Portuguese sailors under the command of Cristóvão de Mendonça. Since the keys have long been lost, their exact origin cannot be verified. However, research by geologist Edmund Gill and historian P.F.B. Alsop showed the deposit they were supposedly found in was 2330–2800 years old, making La Trobe&#x27;s dating impossible.

==Legacy==
Much of Melbourne&#x27;s substantial inner-ring parks and gardens can be attributed to La Trobe&#x27;s foresight in reserving this land.

Melbourne and Victoria are dotted with things named in honour of La Trobe, including La Trobe Street, Latrobe River, La Trobe University, La Trobe Financial in the Melbourne central business district, and Charles La Trobe College in Melbourne&#x27;s north east, the La Trobe Reading Room at the State Library of Victoria on La Trobe Street in the CBD, the federal electorate of La Trobe in Melbourne&#x27;s outer east, the Latrobe Valley in southeastern Victoria, Mount LaTrobe in Wilsons Promontory and, in Tasmania, Latrobe and Latrobe Council.

There are statues of La Trobe outside the State Library and at La Trobe University&#x27;s Bundoora campus, the latter statue is notable for initially being upside-down in appearance, symbolising the notion that universities have a duty to &quot;turn ideas on their head&quot;.

&quot;The La Trobe Journal&quot; (founded 1968) is published by the State Library of Victoria. It is devoted to Australasia, especially in connection with Victoria.

The family motto of La Trobe is used at La Trobe University for their own motto. The motto in English is &quot;whoever seeks shall find&quot;.

The flowering plant genus &quot;Latrobea&quot; was named after him.

==Involvement in Native Police Corps==

The Native Police Corps as the Aboriginal force was known, was limited initially to one division in the Port Phillip District of the colony, around Melbourne. 

In 1842, the formation of the Native Police Corps was halted due to funding problems.
These issues delayed reformation of the corps until Superintendent Charles La Trobe indicated he was willing to underwrite the costs in 1842.

Native Police Corps were primarily a force of armed and mounted Aboriginal police under the command of white officers. They were used to patrol the often vast geographical areas along the colonial frontier in order to conduct indiscriminate raids and punitive expeditions against Aboriginal people. 
The Native Police proved to be a brutally destructive instrument in the disintegration and dispossession of Indigenous Australians.

<doc id="984711" wikidata="Q355395" url="?curid=984711" title="Chill Out (KLF album)">
<text>Chill Out is the debut studio album by British electronic music group The KLF, released on 5 February 1990. It is an ambient-styled concept album featuring an extensive selection of samples, portraying a mythical night-time journey throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast states, beginning in Texas and ending in Louisiana. &quot;Chill Out&quot; was conceived as a continuous piece of music, with original KLF music interwoven with samples from songs by Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac, Acker Bilk, Van Halen, 808 State and field recordings of Tuvan throat singers.

==Context==
&quot;Chill Out&quot; was released during the KLF&#x27;s ambient phase, and was credited by Bob Stanley for pioneering ambient house, drawing attention to the album&#x27;s mix of &quot;train noises, post-punk dub and pre-punk Floyd. It has also been described as a sound collage, with its blend of sound effects, environmental noise, throat singing and musical samples.

===Composition and recording===
&quot;&quot; first appeared on the 1989 single &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot;.

According to the sleeve notes, &quot;Chill Out&quot; was recorded &quot;live on location&quot; at Trancentral, the &quot;spiritual home of the KLF&quot;, their studio in the basement of KLF member Jimmy Cauty&#x27;s squat in Stockwell, South London.

The KLF have stated that the album was recorded in a 44-minute live take. In an interview Jimmy Cauty stated that, &quot;There&#x27;s no edits on it. Quite a few times we&#x27;d get near the end and make a mistake and so we&#x27;d have to go all the way back to the beginning and set it all up again&quot;. According to Cauty&#x27;s co-founder of The KLF, Bill Drummond, the album took two days to put together. &quot;Record Collector&quot; compared The KLF&#x27;s production method to that of established electronic musicians: &quot;While electronic dinosaurs like Jean Michel Jarre and Klaus Schulze were walling themselves in with banks and banks of synthesizers, computers and electronic gadgetry the KLF were doing the opposite—making a crafted work like &quot;Chill Out&quot; with the bare necessities of musical survival.&quot;

After recording, the duo thought the sound to be evocative of a trip through the American Deep South. Drummond said &quot;I&#x27;ve never been to those places. I don&#x27;t know what those places are like, but in my head, I can imagine those sounds coming from those places, just looking at the map.&quot; The titles of the parts are poetic descriptions—often complete sentences—incorporating statements of time, place and situation along the Gulf Coast journey.

&quot;Chill Out&quot; is a single continuous musical piece having many distinctive sections, each of which either segues into or introduces the next. The album as a whole is a progression, with percussion gradually introduced during the second half. The album has many recurring musical elements, which unify and merge the parts into the collective whole. Common characteristics of most parts include ethereal background synthesizers, the use of echo and pitch bend, samples of nature and transport, and the punctuation of soft synthesizer loops by sudden flourishes of harmonious sound. The Deep South is variously represented using original pedal steel contributions from Graham Lee and emotionally charged samples of US radio broadcasts: an evangelist&#x27;s sermon, a range of samples of a very intense salesman, and, in &quot;&quot;, a detailed news report of the road accident in Wantagh that resulted in the death of 17-year-old Jack Atsidakos.

Despite the specific US settings, &quot;Chill Out&quot; is multi-ethnic, its journey taking in pastoral shepherds, Russian broadcasts, Tuvan throat singers (&quot;Dream Time in Lake Jackson&quot;), exotic birds, and an African-sounding original female vocal from The JAMs&#x27; &quot;1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)&quot; that later became The KLF&#x27;s &quot;Justified and Ancient&quot;.

Elements of The KLF&#x27;s &quot;Pure Trance&quot; singles &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; and &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot; are brought to the fore during the second half of the album, progressing from the minimalist synths of the opening half. Similarly, samples of other artists&#x27; work appear as the composition develops, harmonising with The KLF&#x27;s original instrumentation.

===Identified samples===
The samples used in &quot;Chill Out&quot; contribute fundamentally to the character of the composition. In particular, the recurring sampled sound effects of rolling stock and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of Elektra Records&#x27; &quot;Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2&quot;. The tracks used are &quot;Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass&quot; and &quot;Short Freight Train Pass&quot;, along with processed versions of &quot;F18 Diamond Fly-By&quot;, &quot;Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out&quot;, and &quot;Surf&quot;. Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the BBC pips and a jingle from Tommy Vance&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1: &quot;Rock radio into the nineties and beyond&quot;. Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s &quot;Disappearing World&quot; series on Granada TV in the UK. The phrase &quot;Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, savage&quot; is taken from the 1957 science fiction film &quot;The Brain from Planet Arous&quot;.

The album features samples of distinctive melodies from the musical recordings of other artists: Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1969 UK No. 2 single &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1968 UK No. 1 single &quot;Albatross&quot;, as well as &quot;Oh Well Part II&quot;, and Acker Bilk&#x27;s 1961 US No. 1 single &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; all feature prominently, in each case set to an accompaniment of original music. The composers of these hits receive co-writing credit for &quot;Elvis on the Radio Steel Guitar in My Soul&quot;, &quot;3am Somewhere out of Beaumont&quot;, and &quot;A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back&quot; respectively, and the performers are thanked in the &quot;Chill Out&quot; sleevenotes. Boy George&#x27;s band Jesus Loves You is also thanked for a sample from the single &quot;After the Love&quot;, which also features on &quot;3am Somewhere out of Beaumont&quot;. Short samples from the Van Halen instrumental &quot;Eruption&quot; emerge throughout the song &quot;A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back&quot;. Shortly after the 2:00 mark of &quot;The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By&quot;, a sample from the theme music of the 1958 film &quot;The Big Country&quot; can be heard as well as &quot;Pacific State&quot; by 808 State.


==Reception==
Ian Cranna of &quot;Q&quot;, reviewing &quot;Chill Out&quot; at the time of its release, described the album as an &quot;impressionist soundtrack&quot; whose &quot;spartan but melodic electronic strains ease gently through wide open spaces&quot;, and concluded that it is &quot;both imaginative in itself and successful in inducing a blissed out mood of peace and relaxation (at least at night).&quot; &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Chill Out&quot; &quot;a riot of running water, birdsong and electronic womb music&quot;; reviewer Helen Mead said that the album, with its variety of sampled sounds, &quot;not so much... distracts you as envelops you&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Phil Cheeseman summarised &quot;Chill Out&quot; as &quot;one long piece of flowing synthesised relaxation dotted with some very witty samples&quot;, recommending that it be listened to &quot;as a prelude to a long night in, preferably not alone.&quot; Ian McCann of &quot;The Face&quot; proposed that if the listener is not under the influence of drugs, the album sounds &quot;hopelessly pompous and almost classical.&quot; In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Russell Brown panned it as &quot;too arbitrary and formless; it contains virtually no ozone-destroying beats at all.&quot;

In a 1994 retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot;″s Andrew Collins described The KLF as &quot;ahead of their time&quot; and added that &quot;the fact that &quot;Chill Out&quot; was seen largely as a urinary extraction exercise at the time when such sound-painting now shapes young careers lends poignancy to its more balmy yet knowing moments.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; called the album The KLF&#x27;s &quot;comedown classic&quot;, while John Bush of AllMusic awarded it five stars and cited it as &quot;one of the essential ambient albums&quot;. In an &quot;On Second Thought&quot; review in &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, writer Scott Plagenhoef found &quot;Chill Out&quot; to be &quot;less a morning after and more the slow awakening to a new day&quot; and an album which &quot;slowly unfolds its charms&quot;. Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; was less favourable, likening it to &quot;an accidental recording of 1970 Pink Floyd sessions during which all the participants have either left or fallen asleep&quot; and calling it &quot;the pleasantly attenuated soundtrack to a non-existent film that is easily forgotten.&quot;

In a 1996 feature, &quot;Mixmag&quot; named &quot;Chill Out&quot; the fifth best dance album of all time, citing Jimmy Cauty and Alex Paterson as having &quot;kickstarted&quot; ambient music with their DJ sets at the &quot;seminal&quot; house night &quot;Land of Oz&quot;. Dom Philips of &quot;Mixmag&quot; described &quot;Chill Out&quot; as &quot;a gorgeous patchwork of sound, noise and melody ... the samples are carefully woven into a beautiful spider&#x27;s web of sound.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard&quot; in &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;, their list of the 500 greatest songs between 1977 and 2006, and later ranked the track at number 80 in their &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s&quot; list in 2010. In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 76 in their list of &quot;The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot;.

==Themes==
The use of a journey as a unifying musical or conceptual thread featured several times in Cauty and Drummond&#x27;s work, including &quot;The White Room&quot;, &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;, &quot;Justified and Ancient&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Cauty&#x27;s &quot;Space&quot; and The Orb&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Orb&#x27;s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld&quot; also employ the journey concept.

Sheep, which appear both on the recording of &quot;Chill Out&quot;—as guest vocalists according to Scott Piering&#x27;s press release—and in its sleeve artwork, became a theme of The KLF&#x27;s output, featuring in the ambient video &quot;Waiting&quot;, &quot;The White Room&quot; album artwork, and later—in a macabre gesture—after their controversial appearance at the 1992 Brit Awards ceremony. Drummond credits the sleeve of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; as providing inspiration for the artwork of &quot;Chill Out&quot;.

Drummond has documented his affinity for pedal steel and country music, stating that although he has &quot;loved all sorts of music, ... country music is the only music [he&#x27;s] been totally able to identify with&quot;, and declaring: &quot;the weep of a pedal steel guitar is the sound of heartstrings being torn&quot;.

According to Drummond, the album and album sleeve has &quot;the vibe of the rave scene over here [in the UK]. When we&#x27;re having the big Orbital raves out in the country, and you&#x27;re dancing all night and then the sun would come up in the morning, and then you&#x27;d be surrounded by this English rural countryside ... we wanted something that kind of reflected that, that feeling the day after the rave, that&#x27;s what we wanted the music for&quot;. The cover was also inspired by that of the Pink Floyd album &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;.

==Personnel==
The sleeve notes that the album was &quot;Composed Compiled and Collated by the KLF&quot;. Simon Reynolds (1999) and Mark Prendergast (2003) report the uncredited involvement of Alex Paterson, whereas a 1993 piece in &quot;i-D&quot;—in which Paterson was interviewed—claimed that &quot;Chill Out&quot; was a &quot;spin-off&quot; from the Cauty/Paterson sessions at Trancentral. However, in a 2011 interview with &quot;Magnetic Magazine&quot;, Paterson corroborated his involvement and contribution to the album and said he had in fact been &quot;ripped off&quot; by The KLF and notably Cauty, stating; &quot;KLF put the Chill Out album out, which was basically a bunch of my DJ sessions at Trancentral which I never got credited for. That was one of the major reasons why Jimi and I split up. It was becoming apparent to me that everything he said he had given me, he never gave me. That shaped quite a lot of things in my head. Never to be ripped off again, I suppose. Don&#x27;t worry, I got ripped off again. But as Jimi said to me, you&#x27;re never really famous until you&#x27;ve been ripped off.&quot;

==Legacy==
In August 1990, the single &quot;What Time Is Love? (Remodelled &amp; Remixed)&quot; was released. It included the ambient house &quot;Virtual Reality Mix&quot;, reprising many elements of &quot;Chill Out&quot;.

Elements of &quot;Chill Out&quot; also featured heavily in The KLF&#x27;s &quot;UFO Mix&quot; of &quot;It Must Be Obvious&quot; by Pet Shop Boys, released in September 1990 and incorporating &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, a &quot;Pure Trance&quot; track not used on the LP.

In July 2004, UK performance collective Popdamage &quot;reconstructed&quot; &quot;Chill Out&quot; as a live performance at The Big Chill music festival, recreating many of the album&#x27;s vocal and musical samples live on-stage.

In February 2021, the KLF released &quot;Come Down Dawn&quot;, a reworking of &quot;Chill Out&quot; with a selection of prominent but unlicensed samples from the original release removed.

==Track listing==
The track listing of &quot;Chill Out&quot; uses the start- and end-points of the parts, instead of the conventional track numbering system, indicating that the album be treated as a single composition. For the original KLF Communications CD release, the entire album was written to one track.

<text>Pierce Mason Butler (April 11, 1798August 20, 1847) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the 56th Governor of South Carolina from 1836 to 1838. He was killed while serving as colonel of the Palmetto Regiment at the Battle of Churubusco, during the Mexican–American War.
==Early life and family==
Born in Edgefield County, South Carolina, Butler was a son of William Butler and a brother of Andrew Pickens Butler and William Butler, Jr., all of whom served in the United States Congress. He was educated by Moses Waddel at the Willington Academy in Willington, South Carolina. He owned a 154-acre plantation with 27 slaves.
==Military service==
Butler was appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1818 and rose to the rank of captain before resigning his commission in 1829. Following his term as Governor of South Carolina, he became agent to the Cherokee at Fort Gibson (present day Muskogee County, Oklahoma), a post he held until 1846.
==Burial==
Following his death in Mexico, Butler&#x27;s body was returned to South Carolina for burial. He was first entombed at Trinity Episcopal Church, just across from the State House. In December 1853 he was reburied in the Butler Family Cemetery, in the graveyard of what is now the Butler Methodist Church in Saluda County. Others buried in the plot are his father, Major General William Butler, his mother, Behethland Foote Moore Butler, a sister, five of his six brothers, Colonel Zachariah Smith Brooks, grandfather of Preston Brooks, and two children of his brother William, the only sibling not buried there. He is buried at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenville. Collectively they were four Colonels, one General, one Lt. Colonel, three Majors, and one Judge and US Senator. The General was a member of Congress, too.
==Descendants==
James C. Gardner, who served from 1954 to 1958 as the mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana, is a descendant of Pierce Mason Butler.

<doc id="984718" wikidata="Q1060280" url="?curid=984718" title="Advanced driver-assistance system">
<text>Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are technologies that assist drivers with the safe operation of a vehicle. Through a human-machine interface, ADAS increase car and road safety. ADAS use automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors, and respond accordingly. ADAS can enable various levels of autonomous driving.

As most road crashes occur due to human error, ADAS are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle technology for safety and better driving. ADAS are proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error. Safety features are designed to avoid crashes and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems, implementing safeguards, and taking control of the vehicle if necessary. ADAS may provide adaptive cruise control, assist in avoiding collisions, alert drivers to possible obstacles, warn of lane departure, assist in lane centering, incorporate satellite navigation, provide traffic warnings, provide navigational assistance through smartphones, automate lighting, or provide other features. According to the national crash database in the US, Forward Collision Prevention systems have the potential to reduce crashes by 29%. Similarly, Lane Keeping Assistance is shown to offer a reduction potential of 19%, while Blind Zone Detection could decrease crash incidents by 9%.

According to a 2021 research report from Canalys, approximately 33 percent of new vehicles sold in the United States, Europe, Japan, and China had ADAS. The firm also predicted that fifty percent of all automobiles on the road by the year 2030 would be ADAS-enabled.

==Terminology==

Some groups advocate standardization of the name, such as Forward Collision Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking rather than Forward Collision Alert or Smart City Brake Support.

Such standardization is promoted by AAA, Consumer Reports, J.D. Power, National Safety Council, PAVE, and SAE International.

==Concept, history and development==
ADAS were first being used in the 1970s with the adoption of the anti-lock braking system. Early ADAS include electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, blind spot information systems, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and traction control. These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments or damage from a collision. This has led many manufacturers to require automatic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed.

===Technical concepts===
The reliance on data that describes the outside environment of the vehicle, compared to internal data, differentiates ADAS from driver-assistance systems (DAS). ADAS rely on inputs from multiple data sources, including automotive imaging, LiDAR, radar, image processing, computer vision, and in-car networking. Additional inputs are possible from other sources separate from the primary vehicle platform, including other vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle or V2V communication) and infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure or V2I communication). Modern cars have ADAS integrated into their electronics; manufacturers can add these new features during the design process or after production via over-the-air (OTA) updates.

ADAS are considered real-time systems since they react quickly to multiple inputs and prioritize the incoming information to prevent crashes. The systems use preemptive priority scheduling to organize which task needs to be done first. The incorrect assignment of these priorities is what can cause more harm than good.

===ADAS levels===

ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). ADAS can be divided into six levels. In level 0, ADAS cannot control the car and can only provide information for the driver to interpret on their own. Some ADAS that are considered level 0 are: parking sensors, surround-view, traffic sign recognition, lane departure warning, night vision, blind spot information system, rear-cross traffic alert, and forward-collision warning. Level 1 and 2 are very similar in that they both have the driver do most of the decision making. The difference is level 1 can take control over one functionality and level 2 can take control over multiple to aid the driver. ADAS that are considered level 1 are: adaptive cruise control, emergency brake assist, automatic emergency brake assist, lane-keeping, and lane centering. ADAS that are considered level 2 are: highway assist, autonomous obstacle avoidance, and autonomous parking. From level 3 to 5, the amount of control the vehicle has increases; level 5 being where the vehicle is fully autonomous. Some of these systems have not yet been fully embedded in commercial vehicles. For instance, highway chauffeur is a Level 3 system, and automated valet parking is a level 4 system, both of which are not in full commercial use in 2019. The levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 - no automation; Level 1 - hands on/shared control; Level 2 - hands off; Level 3 - eyes off; Level 4 - mind off, and Level 5 - steering wheel optional.

==Feature examples==
This list is not a comprehensive list of all of the ADAS. Instead, it provides information on critical examples of ADAS that have progressed and become more commonly available since 2015.

=== Alerts and warnings ===

* Blind spot monitor involves cameras that monitor the driver&#x27;s blind spots and notify the driver if any obstacles come close to the vehicle. Blind spots are defined as the areas behind or at the side of the vehicle that the driver cannot see from the driver&#x27;s seat. Blind-spot monitoring systems typically work in conjunction with emergency braking systems to act accordingly if any obstacles come into the vehicle&#x27;s path. A rear cross traffic alert (RCTA) typically works in conjunction with the blind spot monitoring system, warning the driver of approaching cross-traffic when reversing out of a parking spot.
* Driver drowsiness detection aims to prevent collisions due to driver fatigue. The vehicle obtains information, such as facial patterns, steering movement, driving habits, turn signal use, and driving velocity, to determine if the driver&#x27;s activities correspond with drowsy driving. If drowsy driving is suspected, the vehicle will typically sound off a loud alert and may vibrate the driver&#x27;s seat. 
* Driver monitoring system is designed to monitor the alertness of the driver. These systems use biological and performance measures to assess the driver&#x27;s alertness and ability to conduct safe driving practices. Currently, these systems use infrared sensors and cameras to monitor the driver&#x27;s attentiveness through eye-tracking. If the vehicle detects a possible obstacle, it will notify the driver and if no action is taken, the vehicle may react to the obstacle.
* Electric vehicle warning sounds notify pedestrians and cyclists that a hybrid or plug-in electric vehicle is nearby, typically delivered through a noise, such as a beep or horn. This technology was developed in response to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ruling that issued 50 percent of quiet vehicles must have a device implemented into their systems that sound off when the vehicle travels at speeds less than 30 km/h (18.6 mph) by September 2019.
* Forward collision warning (FCW) monitor the speed of the vehicle and the vehicle in front of it, and the open distance around the vehicle. FCW systems will send an alert to the driver of a possible impending collision if gets too close to the vehicle in front of it.  These systems do not take control of the vehicle, as currently, FCW systems only send an alert signal to the driver in the form of an audio alert, visual pop-up display, or other warning alert.
* Intelligent speed adaptation or intelligent speed advice (ISA) assists drivers with compliance to the speed limit. They take in information of the vehicle&#x27;s position and notify the driver when they are not enforcing the speed limit. Some ISA systems allow the vehicle to adjust its speed to adhere to the relative speed limit. Other ISA systems only warn the driver when they are going over the speed limit and leave it up to the driver to enforce the speed limit or not.
* Intersection assistants use two radar sensors in the front bumper and sides of the car to monitor if there are any oncoming cars at intersections, highway exits, or car parks. This system alerts the driver of any upcoming traffic from the vehicle&#x27;s sides and can enact the vehicle&#x27;s emergency braking system to prevent the collision.
* Lane departure warning system (LDW) alerts the driver when they partially merge into a lane without using their turn signals. An LDW system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to determine if the driver unintentionally begins to drift. This system does not take control of the vehicle to help sway the car back into the safety zone but instead sends an audio or visual alert to the driver.
* Parking sensors can scan the vehicle&#x27;s surroundings for objects when the driver initiates parking. Audio warnings can notify the driver of the distance between the vehicle and its surrounding objects. Typically, the faster the audio warnings are issued, the closer the vehicle is getting to the object. These sensors may not detect objects closer to the ground, such as parking stops, which is why parking sensors typically work alongside backup cameras to assist the driver when reversing into a parking spot.
* Tire pressure monitoring determine when the tire pressure is outside the normal inflation pressure range. The driver can monitor the tire pressure and is notified when there is a sudden drop through a pictogram display, gauge, or low-pressure warning signal.
* Vibrating seat warnings alert the driver of danger. GM&#x27;s Cadillacs have offered vibrating seat warnings since the 2013 Cadillac ATS. If the driver begins drifting out of the traveling lane of a highway, the seat vibrates in the direction of the drift, warning the driver of danger. The safety alert seat also provides a vibrating pulse on both sides of the seat when a frontal threat is detected.
* Wrong-way driving warning issue alerts to drivers when it is detected that they are on the wrong side of the road. Vehicles with this system enacted can use sensors and cameras to identify the direction of oncoming traffic flow. In conjunction with lane detection services, this system can also notify drivers when they partially merge into the wrong side of the road 

===Crash mitigation===
* Pedestrian protection systems are designed to minimize the number of crashes or injuries that occur between a vehicle and a pedestrian. This system uses cameras and sensors to determine when the front of a vehicle strikes a pedestrian. When the collision occurs, the vehicle&#x27;s bonnet lifts to provide a cushion between the vehicle&#x27;s hard engine components and the pedestrian. This helps minimize the possibility of a severe head injury when the pedestrian&#x27;s head comes into contact with the vehicle.

===Driving task assistance===
* Adaptive cruise control (ACC) can maintain a chosen velocity and distance between a vehicle and the vehicle ahead. ACC can automatically brake or accelerate with concern to the distance between the vehicle and the vehicle ahead. ACC systems with stop and go features can come to a complete stop and accelerate back to the specified speed. This system still requires an alert driver to take in their surroundings, as it only controls speed and the distance between you and the car in front of you. 
* Anti-lock braking system (ABS) restore traction to a car&#x27;s tires by regulating the brake pressure when the vehicle begins to skid. Alongside helping drivers in emergencies, such as when their car starts to skid on ice, ABS systems can also assist drivers who may lose control of their vehicle. With the growing popularity in the 1990s, ABS systems have become standard in vehicles. 
* Automatic parking fully takes over control of parking functions, including steering, braking, and acceleration, to assist drivers in parking. Depending on the relative cars and obstacles, the vehicle positions itself safely into the available parking spot. Currently, the driver must still be aware of the vehicle&#x27;s surroundings and be willing to take control of it if necessary.
* Collision avoidance system (pre-crash system) uses small radar detectors, typically placed near the front of the car, to determine the car&#x27;s vicinity to nearby obstacles and notify the driver of potential car crash situations. These systems can account for any sudden changes to the car&#x27;s environment that may cause a collision. Systems can respond to a possible collision situation with multiple actions, such as sounding an alarm, tensing up passengers’ seat belts, closing a sunroof, and raising reclined seats.
* Crosswind stabilization helps prevent a vehicle from overturning when strong winds hit its side by analyzing  the vehicle&#x27;s yaw rate, steering angle, lateral acceleration, and velocity sensors. This system distributes the wheel load in relation to the velocity and direction of the crosswind.
* Cruise control can maintain a specific speed pre-determined by the driver. The car will maintain the speed the driver sets until the driver hits the brake pedal, clutch pedal, or disengages the system. Specific cruise control systems can accelerate or decelerate, but require the driver to click a button and notify the car of the goal speed. 
* Electronic stability control (ESC) can reduce the speed of the car and activate individual brakes to prevent understeer and oversteer. Understeer occurs when the car&#x27;s front wheels do not have enough traction to make the car turn and oversteer occurs when the car turns more than intended, causing the car to spin out. In conjunction with other car safety technologies, such as anti-lock braking and traction control, the ESC can safely help drivers maintain control of the car in unforeseen situations.
* Emergency driver assistant facilitates emergency counteract measures if the driver falls asleep or does not perform any driving action after a defined length of time. After a specified period of time, if the driver has not interacted with the accelerator, brake, or steering wheel, the car will send audio, visual, and physical signals to the driver. If the driver does not wake up after these signals, the system will stop, safely position the vehicle away from oncoming traffic, and turn on the hazard warning lights.
* Hill descent control helps drivers maintain a safe speed when driving down a hill or other decline. These systems are typically enacted if the vehicle moves faster than 15 to 20 mph when driving down. When a change in grade is sensed, hill descent control automates the driver&#x27;s speed to descend down the steep grade safely. This system works by pulsing the braking system and controlling each wheel independently to maintain traction down the descent.
* Hill-start assist also known as hill-start control or hill holder, helps prevent a vehicle from rolling backward down a hill when starting again from a stopped position. This feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal and the gas pedal. For manual cars, this feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal, the clutch, and the gas pedal.
* Lane centering assists the driver in keeping the vehicle centered in a lane. A lane-centering system may autonomously take over the steering when it determines the driver is at risk of deterring from the lane. This system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to stay within a safe distance between both sides of the lane.
* Lane change assistance helps the driver through a safe completion of a lane change by using sensors to scan the vehicle&#x27;s surroundings and monitor the driver&#x27;s blind spots. When a driver intends to make a lane change, the vehicle will notify the driver through an audio or visual alert when a vehicle is approaching from behind or is in the vehicle&#x27;s blind spot. The visual alert may appear in the dashboard, heads-up-display, or the exterior rear-view mirrors. Several kind of lane change assistance might exist, for instance UNECE regulation 79 considers:
** &quot;ACSF (Automatically commanded steering function) of Category C&quot; (...) a function which is initiated/activated by the driver and which can perform a single lateral manoeuvre (e.g. lane change) when commanded by the driver.
** &quot;ACSF of Category D&quot; (...) a function which is initiated/activated by the driver and which can indicate the possibility of a single lateral manoeuvre (e.g. lane change) but performs that function only following a confirmation by the driver.
** &quot;ACSF of Category E&quot; (...) a function which is initiated/activated by the driver and which can continuously determine the possibility of a manoeuvre (e.g. lane change) and complete these manoeuvres for extended periods without further driver command/confirmation.
* Rain sensors detect water and automatically trigger electrical actions, such as the raising of open windows and the closing of open convertible tops. A rain sensor can also take in the frequency of rain droplets to automatically trigger windshield wipers with an accurate speed for the corresponding rainfall.
* Traction control system (TCS) helps prevent traction loss in vehicles and prevent vehicle turnover on sharp curves and turns. By limiting tire slip, or when the force on a tire exceeds the tire&#x27;s traction, this limits power delivery and helps the driver accelerate the car without losing control. These systems use the same wheel-speed sensors as the antilock braking systems. Individual wheel braking systems are deployed through TCS to control when one tire spins faster than the others.

===Visual and environmental monitoring===

* Automotive head-up display (auto-HUD) safely displays essential system information to a driver at a vantage point that does not require the driver to look down or away from the road. Currently, the majority of the auto-HUD systems on the market display system information on a windshield using LCDs.
* Automotive navigation system use digital mapping tools, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and traffic message channel (TMC), to provide drivers with up to date traffic and navigation information. Through an embedded receiver, an automotive navigation system can send and receive data signals transmitted from satellites regarding the current position of the vehicle in relation to its surroundings. 
* Automotive night vision systems enable the vehicle to detect obstacles, including pedestrians, in a nighttime setting or heavy weather situation when the driver has low visibility. These systems can various technologies, including infrared sensors, GPS, Lidar, and Radar, to detect pedestrians and non-human obstacles.
* Backup camera provides real-time video information regarding the location of your vehicle and its surroundings. This camera offers driver&#x27;s aid when backing up by providing a viewpoint that is typically a blind spot in traditional cars. When the driver puts the car in reverse, the camera automatically turns on.
* Glare-free high beam use Light Emitting Diodes, more commonly known as LEDs, to cut two or more cars from the light distribution. This allows oncoming vehicles coming in the opposite direction not to be affected by the light of the  high-beams. In 2010, the VW Touareg introduced the first glare-free high beam headlamp system, which used a mechanical shutter to cut light from hitting specific traffic participants.
* Omniview technology improves a driver&#x27;s visibility by offering a 360-degree viewing system. This system can accurately provide 3D peripheral images of the car&#x27;s surroundings through video display outputted to the driver. Currently, commercial systems can only provide 2D images of the driver&#x27;s surroundings. Omniview technology uses the input of four cameras and a bird&#x27;s eye technology to provide a composite 3D model of the surroundings.
* Traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems can recognize common traffic signs, such as a “stop” sign or a “turn ahead” sign, through image processing techniques. This system takes into account the sign&#x27;s shape, such as hexagons and rectangles, and the color to classify what the sign is communicating to the driver. Since most systems currently use camera-based technology, a wide variety of factors can make the system less accurate. These include poor lighting conditions, extreme weather conditions, and partial obstruction of the sign.
* Vehicular communication systems come in three forms: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X). V2V systems allow vehicles to exchange information with each other about their current position and upcoming hazards. V2I systems occur when the vehicle exchanges information with nearby infrastructure elements, such as street signs. V2X systems occur when the vehicle monitors its environment and takes in information about possible obstacles or pedestrians in its path.

=== Hands-off systems===

Ford and General Motors provide &quot;hands-off, eyes-on&quot; systems such as Blue Cruise and Super Cruise in North America. These systems allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel while the system is engaged. However, drivers must keep their eyes on the road and be ready to take immediate action at all times.

==Adoption==

In Europe, in Q2 2018, 3% of sold passenger cars had level 2 autonomy driving features. In Europe, in Q2 2019, 325,000 passenger cars are sold with level 2 autonomy driving features, that is 8% of all new cars sold.

According to a 2021 research report from Canalys, approximately 33 percent of new vehicles sold in the United States, Europe, Japan, and China had ADAS features. The firm also predicted that fifty percent of all automobiles on the road by the year 2030 would be ADAS-enabled.

===Branding===
Major car brands with Level 2 features include Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, Volvo, Tata, Citroën, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, Peugeot, Mahindra and Subaru. Full Level 2 features are included with Full Self-Driving from Tesla, Pilot Assist from Volvo, OpenPilot from Comma.ai and ProPILOT Assist from Nissan.

Level 3 features are included in Drive Pilot from Mercedes-Benz.
===Crash statistics===
On June 29, 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the branch of the United States Department of Transportation responsible for federal motor vehicle regulations, issued Standing General Order 2021-01 (SGO 2021-01), which required manufacturers of ADAS (Levels 1 or 2) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) (Levels 3 through 5) to promptly report crashes that occurred when driver-assistance or automation systems were in use. SGO 2021-01 subsequently was amended on August 5, 2021. Under the amended SGO 2021-01, a crash involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS is reportable to the NHTSA if it meets the following criteria:
* it happened on a publicly accessible road in the United States
* the Levels 3–5 ADS or Level 2 ADAS was engaged at any time within 30 seconds before the start of the crash through the conclusion of the crash

A severe crash is one that results in one or more of the following:
* transport to a hospital for medical treatment or a fatality, regardless of whether that person was an occupant of the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L2 ADAS
* a vehicle tow-away or an air bag deployment, regardless of whether that is the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L2 ADAS
* involves a vulnerable road user (anyone who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle with more than three wheels: typically pedestrians, wheelchair users, motorcyclists, or bicyclists), regardless of that vulnerable road user&#x27;s influence on the cause of the crash

The incident report to the NHTSA must be made according to the following schedule:
* Severe crashes must be reported within one calendar day after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred. In addition, an updated crash incident report must be made within ten calendar days after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred.
* Otherwise, non-severe crashes involving ADS (excluding L2 ADAS) must be reported on the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month in which the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred.

SGO 2021-01 is in effect for three years, starting on June 29, 2021. After gathering data for almost a year (July 1, 2021 through May 15, 2022), the NHTSA released the initial set of data in June 2022 and stated they plan to update the data on a monthly basis. The data are subject to several caveats and limitations; for instance, manufacturers are not required to report the number of vehicles that have been built and equipped with ADS/ADAS, the number of vehicles operating with ADS/ADAS, or the total distance traveled with ADS/ADAS active, which would be helpful to normalize the incident report data.

According to the initial data covering July 2021 to May 15, 2022, ADS (Levels 3–5) from 25 different manufacturers were involved in 130 crashes, led by Waymo LLC (62), Transdev Alternative Services (34), Cruise LLC (23), General Motors (16), and Argo AI (10); because multiple manufacturers can report the same crash, the sum exceeds the total number of reportable incidents. Of the 130 crashes, 108 had no associated injuries reported; there was only one serious injury associated with the remaining crashes. The most commonly-reported damage location was the rear of the ADS-equipped vehicle.

Similarly, ADAS (Level 2) from 12 different manufacturers were involved in 367 crashes over the same period; 392 crashes were reported in total, but 25 either occurred before July 2021 or had no associated date. Reported incidents were led by Tesla (273), Honda (90), and Subaru (10). Of the 392 crashes, 98 included injury reporting; of the 98, 46 had no injuries reported, 5 resulted in serious injuries and 6 resulted in fatalities. The most commonly-reported damage location was the front of the ADAS-equipped vehicle.

==Potential issues and concerns==
===Need for standardization===
According to PACTS, lack of full standardization might make the system have difficulty being understandable by the driver who might believe that the car behaves like another car while it does not.

ADAS might have many limitations, for instance a pre-collision system might have 12 pages to explain 23 exceptions where ADAS may operate when not needed and 30 exceptions where ADAS may not operate when a collision is likely.
Names for ADAS features are not standardized. For instance, adaptive cruise control is called &quot;Adaptive Cruise Control&quot; by Fiat, Ford, GM, VW, Volvo and Peugeot, but &quot;Intelligent Cruise Control&quot; by Nissan, &quot;Active Cruise Control&quot; by Citroen and BMW, and &quot;DISTRONIC&quot; by Mercedes. To help with standardization, SAE International has endorsed a series of recommendations for generic ADAS terminology for car manufacturers, that it created with Consumer Reports, the American Automobile Association, J.D. Power, and the National Safety Council.

Buttons and dashboard symbols change from car to car due to lack of standardization.

ADAS behavior might change from car to car, for instance ACC speed might be temporarily overridden in most cars, while some switch to standby after one minute.

=== Insurance and economic impact ===
The AV industry is growing exponentially, and according to a report by Market Research Future, the market is expected to hit over $65 billion by 2027. AV insurance and rising competition are expected to fuel that growth. Auto insurance for ADAS has directly affected the global economy, and many questions have arisen within the general public. ADAS allow autonomous vehicles to enable self-driving features, but there are associated risks with ADAS. AV companies and manufacturers are recommended to have insurance in the following areas in order to avoid any serious litigations. Depending on the level, ranging from 0 to 5, each car manufacturer would find it in its best interest to find the right combination of different insurances to best match their products. Note that this list is not exhaustive and may be constantly updated with more types of insurances and risks in the years to come.
* Technology errors and omissions – This insurance will cover any physical risk if the technology itself has failed. These usually include all of the associated expenses of a car crash.
* Auto liability and physical damage – This insurance covers third-party injuries and technology damage.
* Cyber liability – This insurance will protect companies from any lawsuits from third parties and penalties from regulators regarding cybersecurity.
* Directors and officers – This insurance protects a company&#x27;s balance sheet and assets by protecting the company from bad management or misappropriation of assets.
With the technology embedded in autonomous vehicles, these self-driving cars are able to distribute data if a car crash occurs. This, in turn, will invigorate the claims administration and their operations. Fraud reduction will also disable any fraudulent staging of car crashes by recording the car&#x27;s monitoring of every minute on the road. ADAS are expected to streamline the insurance industry and its economic efficiency with capable technology to fight off fraudulent human behavior. In September 2016, the NHTSA published the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, which describes the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s policies related to highly automated vehicles (HAV) which range from vehicles with ADAS features to autonomous vehicles.

=== Ethical issues and current solutions ===
In March 2014, the US Department of Transportation&#x27;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it will require all new vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) to have rear view cameras by May 2018. The rule was required by Congress as part of the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007. The Act is named after two-year-old Cameron Gulbransen. Cameron&#x27;s father backed up his SUV over him, when he did not see the toddler in the family&#x27;s driveway 

The advancement of autonomous driving is accompanied by ethical concerns. The earliest moral issue associated with autonomous driving can be dated back to as early as the age of the trolleys. The trolley problem is one of the most well-known ethical issues. Introduced by English philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967, the trolley problem asks that under a situation which the trolley&#x27;s brake does not work, and there are five people ahead of the trolley, the driver may go straight, killing the five persons ahead, or turn to the side track killing the one pedestrian, what should the driver do? Before the development of autonomous vehicles, the trolley problem remains an ethical dilemma between utilitarianism and deontological ethics. However, as the advancement in ADAS proceeds, the trolley problem becomes an issue that needs to be addressed by the programming of self-driving cars. The crashes that autonomous vehicles might face could be very similar to those depicted in the trolley problem. Although ADAS make vehicles generally safer than only human-driven cars, crashes are unavoidable. This raises questions such as “whose lives should be prioritized in the event of an inevitable crash?” Or “What should be the universal principle for these ‘crash-algorithms’?”
Many researchers have been working on ways to address the ethical concerns associated with ADAS. For instance, the artificial intelligence approach allows computers to learn human ethics by feeding them data regarding human actions. Such a method is useful when the rules cannot be articulated because the computer can learn and identify the ethical elements on its own without precisely programming whether an action is ethical. However, there are limitations to this approach. For example, many human actions are done out of self-preservation instincts, which is realistic but not ethical; feeding such data to the computer cannot guarantee that the computer captures the ideal behavior. Furthermore, the data fed to an artificial intelligence must be carefully selected to avoid producing undesired outcomes.

Another notable method is a three-phase approach proposed by Noah J. Goodall. This approach first necessitates a system established with the agreement of car manufacturers, transportation engineers, lawyers, and ethicists, and should be set transparently. The second phase is letting artificial intelligence learn human ethics while being bound by the system established in phase one. Lastly, the system should provide constant feedback that is understandable by humans.

== Ratings ==

=== Consumer Reports ===
In October 2023, Consumer Reports rated 17 &quot;active driving assistance systems&quot;. Their criteria were:

* Capabilities and performance
* Clear when safe to use
* Ease of use
* Keeping the driver engaged
* Unresponsive driver

Their ratings were:
=== Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ===
In March 2024, the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) reported its first &quot;partial automation safeguard ratings&quot;. Their criteria were:
* Adaptive cruise control does not automatically resume after a lengthy stop or if the driver is not looking at the road
* Automated lane changes must be initiated or confirmed by the driver
* Automation features cannot be used with seat belt unfastened
* Automation features cannot be used with automatic emergency braking or lane departure prevention/warning disabled
* Fail-safe procedure slows vehicle, notifies manufacturer and keeps automation off limits for remainder of drive
* Lane centering does not discourage steering by driver
* Monitors both the driver&#x27;s gaze and hand position
* Uses multiple types of rapidly escalating alerts to get driver&#x27;s attention

The ratings were (no system received a &quot;good&quot; rating):
== Future ==
Intelligent transport systems (ITS) highly resemble ADAS, but experts believe that ITS goes beyond automatic traffic to include any enterprise that safely transports humans. ITS is where the transportation technology is integrated with a city&#x27;s infrastructure. This would then lead to a “smart city”. These systems promote active safety by increasing the efficiency of roads, possibly by adding 22.5% capacity on average, not the actual count. ADAS have aided in this increase in active safety, according to a study in 2008. ITS systems use a wide system of communication technology, including wireless technology and traditional technology, to enhance productivity.

&quot;Driver control assistance systems&quot; (DCAS) is the name of a draft ADAS regulation.
It would allow hands-free driving with a possible risk of lack of attentiveness.
Such DCAS regulation would allow system such as Tesla FSD in Europe.
The UNECE driver control assistance systems regulation plan that DCAS shall be designed to ensure that the driver performs the driving task, that the driver&#x27;s hands must remain on the wheel and that the system shall monitor the driver&#x27;s visual engagement.

<text>Claude Antoine Jean Georges Napoléon Coste (27 June 1805 – 14 January 1883) was a French classical guitarist and composer.

==Biography==
Napoléon Coste was born in Amondans (Doubs), near Besançon, France. He was first taught the guitar by his mother, an accomplished player. As a teenager he became a teacher of the instrument and appeared in three concerts in the Franche-Comté. In 1829, at the age of 24, he moved to Paris where he studied under Fernando Sor and quickly established himself as the leading French virtuoso guitarist.

Despite declining demand in Paris for guitarists during the years after he arrived, Coste achieved financial stability as a professional musician and composer. Unable to find a publisher, he had to self-publish his works. Napoléon Coste was influenced by the Early Classical-Romantic composers of the time including Hector Berlioz. Coste&#x27;s Opus no.47, La Source du Lyson is inspired by nature much like Berlioz&#x27;s program music.

Coste injured his left shoulder in 1863, though was able to continue public performances until 1881, two years before his death. After Sor&#x27;s death, Coste edited and republished Sor&#x27;s original method for guitar as &quot;Méthode complète pour la Guitare par Ferdinand Sor, rédigée et augmentée de nombreux exemples et leçons par N. Coste&quot; (translated, the title is &quot;Complete Method for Guitar by Ferdinand Sor, Refingered and Expanded with numerous Examples and Lessons by N. Coste&quot;).

Coste was a member of the masonic lodge Les Frères Unis Inséparables.

Coste had a special fondness for playing the seven string guitar. He was famous for his unique seven string guitar with a “floating” 7th string typically tuned to D or C called the Lacôte Heptachord. Tonally this invention created more depth when played as the floating string would vibrate sympathetically even as the other strings were plucked.

He is known as one of the first composers to transcribe guitar music of the 17th century into modern musical notation. He died at age 77, leaving a significant catalogue of original compositions.

<doc id="984726" wikidata="Q419968" url="?curid=984726" title="Neuropeptide">
<text>Neuropeptides are chemical messengers made up of small chains of amino acids that are synthesized and released by neurons. Neuropeptides typically bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to modulate neural activity and other tissues like the gut, muscles, and heart.

Neuropeptides are synthesized from large precursor proteins which are cleaved and post-translationally processed then packaged into large dense core vesicles. Neuropeptides are often co-released with other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in a single neuron, yielding a multitude of effects. Once released, neuropeptides can diffuse widely to affect a broad range of targets.

Neuropeptides are extremely ancient and highly diverse chemical messengers. Placozoans such as &quot;Trichoplax&quot;, extremely basal animals which do not possess neurons, use peptides for cell-to-cell communication in a way similar to the neuropeptides of higher animals.

== Examples ==

Peptide signals play a role in information processing that is different from that of conventional neurotransmitters, and many appear to be particularly associated with specific behaviours. For example, oxytocin and vasopressin have striking and specific effects on social behaviours, including maternal behaviour and pair bonding. CCAP has several functions including regulating heart rate, allatostatin and proctolin regulate food intake and growth, bursicon controls tanning of the cuticle and corazonin has a role in cuticle pigmentation and moulting. 

== Synthesis ==
Neuropeptides are synthesized from inactive precursor proteins called prepropeptides. Prepropeptides contain sequences for a family of distinct peptides and often contain duplicated copies of the same peptides, depending on the organism. In addition to the precursor peptide sequences, prepropeptides also contain a signal peptide, spacer peptides, and cleavage sites. The signal peptide sequence guides the protein to the secretory pathway, starting at the endoplasmic reticulum. The signal peptide sequence is removed in the endoplasmic reticulum, yielding a propeptide. The propeptide travels to the Golgi apparatus where it is proteolytically cleaved and processed into multiple peptides. Peptides are packaged into dense core vesicles, where further cleaving and processing, such as C-terminal amidation, can occur. Dense core vesicles are transported throughout the neuron and can release peptides at the synaptic cleft, cell body, and along the axon.

== Mechanism ==
Neuropeptides are released by dense core vesicles after depolarization of the cell. Compared to classical neurotransmitter signaling, neuropeptide signaling is more sensitive. Neuropeptide receptor affinity is in the nanomolar to micromolar range while neurotransmitter affinity is in the micromolar to millimolar range. Additionally, dense core vesicles contain a small amount of neuropeptide (3 - 10mM) compared to synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters (e.g. 100mM for acetylcholine). Evidence shows that neuropeptides are released after high-frequency firing or bursts, distinguishing dense core vesicle from synaptic vesicle release. Neuropeptides utilize volume transmission and are not reuptaken quickly, allowing diffusion across broad areas (nm to mm) to reach targets. Almost all neuropeptides bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), inducing second messenger cascades to modulate neural activity on long time-scales.

Expression of neuropeptides in the nervous system is diverse. Neuropeptides are often co-released with other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, yielding a diversity of effects depending on the combination of release. For example, vasoactive intestinal peptide is typically co-released with acetylcholine. Neuropeptide release can also be specific. In &quot;Drosophila&quot; larvae, for example, eclosion hormone is expressed in just two neurons.

== Receptor targets ==
Most neuropeptides act on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Neuropeptide-GPCRs fall into two families: rhodopsin-like and the secretin class.  Most peptides activate a single GPCR, while some activate multiple GPCRs (e.g. AstA, AstC, DTK). Peptide-GPCR binding relationships are highly conserved across animals. Aside from conserved structural relationships, some peptide-GPCR functions are also conserved across the animal kingdom. For example, neuropeptide F/neuropeptide Y signaling is structurally and functionally conserved between insects and mammals.

Although peptides mostly target metabotropic receptors, there is some evidence that neuropeptides bind to other receptor targets. Peptide-gated ion channels (FMRFamide-gated sodium channels) have been found in snails and Hydra. Other examples of non-GPCR targets include: insulin-like peptides and tyrosine-kinase receptors in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and atrial natriuretic peptide and eclosion hormone with membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase receptors in mammals and insects.

== Actions ==
Due to their modulatory and diffusive nature, neuropeptides can act on multiple time and spatial scales. Below are some examples of neuropeptide actions:

=== Co-release ===
Neuropeptides are often co-released with other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides to modulate synaptic activity. Synaptic vesicles and dense core vesicles can have differential activation properties for release, resulting in context-dependent co-release combinations. For example, insect motor neurons are glutamatergic and some contain dense core vesicles with proctolin. At low frequency activation, only glutamate is released, yielding fast and rapid excitation of the muscle. At high frequency activation however, dense core vesicles release proctolin, inducing prolonged contractions. Thus, neuropeptide release can be fine-tuned to modulate synaptic activity in certain contexts.

Some regions of the nervous system are specialized to release distinctive sets of peptides. For example, the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland release peptides (e.g. TRH, GnRH, CRH, SST) that act as hormones In one subpoplation of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, three anorectic peptides are co-expressed: α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), galanin-like peptide, and cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and in another subpopulation two orexigenic peptides are co-expressed, neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (AGRP). These peptides are all released in different combinations to signal hunger and satiation cues.

The following is a list of neuroactive peptides co-released with other neurotransmitters. Transmitter names are shown in bold.

Norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
In neurons of the A2 cell group in the nucleus of the solitary tract), norepinephrine co-exists with:
* Galanin
* Enkephalin
* Neuropeptide Y

GABA
* Somatostatin (in the hippocampus)
* Cholecystokinin
* Neuropeptide Y (in the arcuate nucleus)

Acetylcholine
* VIP
* Substance P

Dopamine
* Cholecystokinin
* Neurotensin
* Glucagon-like peptide-1 (in the nucleus accumbens)

Epinephrine (adrenaline)
* Neuropeptide Y
* Neurotensin

Serotonin (5-HT)
* Substance P
* TRH
* Enkephalin

Some neurons make several different peptides. For instance,
vasopressin co-exists with dynorphin and galanin in magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and with CRF (in parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus)

Oxytocin in the supraoptic nucleus co-exists with enkephalin, dynorphin, cocaine-and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) and cholecystokinin.

== Evolution of Neuropeptide Signaling ==
Peptides are ancient signaling systems that are found in almost all animals on Earth. Genome sequencing reveals evidence of neuropeptide genes in Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Placozoa, some of oldest living animals with nervous systems or neural-like tissues. Recent studies also show genomic evidence of neuropeptide processing machinery in metazoans and choanoflagellates, suggesting that neuropeptide signaling may predate the development of nervous tissues. Additionally, Ctenophore and Placozoa neural signaling is entirely peptidergic and lacks the major amine neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. This also suggests that neuropeptide signaling developed before amine neurotransmitters.

== Research history ==
In the early 1900s, chemical messengers were crudely extracted from whole animal brains and tissues and studied for their physiological effects. In 1931, von Euler and Gaddum, used a similar method to try and isolate acetylcholine but instead discovered a peptide substance that induced physiological changes including muscle contractions and depressed blood pressure. These effects were not abolished using atropine, ruling out the substance as acetylcholine. 

In insects, proctolin was the first neuropeptide to be isolated and sequenced. In 1975, Alvin Starratt and Brian Brown extracted the peptide from hindgut muscles of the cockroach and found that its application enhanced muscle contractions. While Starratt and Brown initially thought of proctolin as an excitatory neurotransmitter, proctolin was later confirmed as a neuromodulatory peptide.

David de Wied first used the term &quot;neuropeptide&quot; in the 1970s to delineate peptides derived from the nervous system.

<text>The International Fencing Federation (&quot;Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Escrime&quot;) commonly known by the acronym FIE, is the international governing body of Olympic fencing. Today, its head office is at the Maison du Sport International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The FIE is composed of 155 national federations, each of which is recognized by its country&#x27;s Olympic Committee as the sole representative of Olympic-style fencing in that country.

==History==

The International Fencing Federation (&quot;Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Escrime&quot;) is the heir of the founded in France in 1882, which took part in the global movement of structuring sport. The first international fencing congress was held in Brussels, Belgium in 1897 at the instigation of the , followed by another one in Paris in 1900. On this occasion the organised one of the first international fencing events; French, Italian, Spanish, and Belgian fencers attended the competition. Dissensions rapidly arose between épéeists and foilists, which held the majority at the . The third congress held in Brussels in 1905 voted the creation of an international fencing committee whose mission would be of fostering friendship amongst all fencers, establishing national rules, and supporting the organization of fencing competitions. The third congress also adopted the French rules as the basis for upcoming international competitions. New tensions appeared, this time between France and Italy, about the regulatory weapon grip. They led to the boycott by France of the fencing events of the 1912 Olympic Games. 

A new international congress was called together in Ghent, Belgium, in July 1913. The main matter was the adoption of international regulations for each of the three weapons. The French rules were adopted in épée and foil; the Hungarian rules were chosen for sabre. Frenchman René Lacroix also campaigned for the creation of an international fencing federation.
The International Fencing Federation (&quot;Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Escrime&quot;) was founded on 29 November 1913, in the conference rooms of the Automobile Club de France in Paris. The nine founding nations were Belgium, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway. Albert Feyerick, president of the Federation of fencing clubs of Belgium, was elected as the first president. The FIE held its first congress on 23 June 1914, and accepted the adhesion of seven new countries: Austria, Denmark, Monaco, Romania, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States.

===Presidency of Alisher Usmanov===

Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov was elected president of the FIE in 2008 with 66 votes to 61 for incumbent president René Roch. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2016. In 2021, Usmanov was re-elected by acclamation to a fourth term, for which he was congratulated by Vladimir Putin. 

On 28 February 2022, in reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union blacklisted Usmanov, imposing an EU-wide travel ban on him and freezing all of his assets. The EU stated: &quot;He has been referred to as one of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s favourite oligarchs.&quot; Following the imposition of the sanctions on him, Usmanov announced on 1 March 2022, in an accusatory letter, that he was stepping down as FIE President. On 30 November 2024, he was re-elected to the office for another term.

===Impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine===
In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the FIE agreed with the European Fencing Confederation (EFC) to ban Russian and Belarusian fencers, and reallocated competitions that were due to be held in Russia and Belarus. 

On 10 March 2023, the FIE became the first Olympic governing body to officially reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, in time for the start of the qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Protesting this decision, Denmark, France, Germany, and Poland cancelled upcoming World Cup fencing events to prevent Russians and Belarusians from participating.

In April 2023, it was revealed that the European Fencing Confederation had sent a critical letter to the FIE, outlining their opposition to the FIE&#x27;s plans to strip the countries that had indicated they would not grant visas to Russians and Belarusians from hosting rights, and impose sanctions on them. In addition, the EFC approved in congress in June 2023 that no Russian or Belarusian coach or athlete may compete in an EFC competition, and that Russia and Belarus are suspended as members. Over 200 fencers also signed an open letter in which they objected to the FIE&#x27;s decision to allow the return of Russian and Belarusian fencers as neutrals. In May 2023, the FIE decided to strip individual events at the 2023 European Games in Kraków-Małopolska of their Olympic qualifier status because the Polish organizers banned Russians from participating at the Games, and therefore they organized instead a separate European Championships in Plovdiv for individual events only where Russians were allowed to compete. The Nordic Fencing Union heavily criticized these decisions by the FIE.

===Disqualification of Ukrainian world champion, and subsequent reversal===

In July 2023, Ukrainian four-time individual world sabre champion Olga Kharlan was disqualified by the FIE at the World Fencing Championships. Kharlan defeated Russian Anna Smirnova 15-7. At the time, and since 1 July 2020 (and reconfirmed by FIE public notice in September 2020 and in January 2021), by public written notice the FIE had replaced its previous handshake requirement with a &quot;salute&quot; by the opposing fencers, and written in its public notice that handshakes were &quot;suspended until further notice.&quot; Smirnova extended her hand to Kharlan, who in turn extended her saber in an offer to the Russian to tap blades. Kharlan said her choice of salute was meant as a sign of respect for her opponent, while still acknowledging the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. After a long delay during which Smirnova protested and sat on the strip for 45 minutes, Kharlan was ultimately black-carded and eliminated from the championship by FIE officials. The Russian had been allowed to compete as a neutral athlete. The Ukrainian delegation filed an appeal. The German Fencing Federation criticized the decision by the FIE and maintained that the very strict interpretation of the rules sent a fatal signal far beyond the world of fencing. 

The FIE came under fire for its decision. Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina called the FIE’s disqualification “disrespectful” towards Ukrainians. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, called the FIE decision &quot;absolutely shameful,&quot; and posted a photo on his Twitter feed which appeared to show the Russian fencer smiling and flashing the victory sign with a Russian soldier, writing: &quot;The photo features ... the Russian fencer... As you can see, she openly admires the Russian army... The [FIE] disqualified the Ukrainian representative for not shaking hands with the Russian.&quot; Kharlan said &quot;This federation will never change.&quot; Team USA head coach Yury Gelman said that the FIE was the most corrupt federation in the world.

The IOC strongly disagreed with the FIE&#x27;s actions. On 28 July at the behest of the Comité international olympique, the FIE reversed itself and cancelled its disqualification of Kharlan, making it possible for her to enter the team women&#x27;s sabre event on 29 July, while at the same time arguing that &quot;The FIE stands fully behind the penalty, which, after a thorough review, is in complete accordance and compliance with its official rules and associated penalties.&quot; Kharlan was also told by the IOC in an empathic letter on which the FIE president was copied that due to the circumstances she was being granted automatic qualification into the 2024 Paris Olympics, and that she should &quot;[r]est assured that the IOC will continue to stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and the Olympic community of Ukraine during these extremely difficult times.&quot; Subsequently, though the FIE had defended its position in its interim president&#x27;s letter to Kharlan, Bruno Gares, the FIE&#x27;s representative of the Executive Committee in the Rules Commission said that -- after the required salutes at the end of a bout -- handshakes would become optional, with a distance greeting permitted instead.

==Events==
Competitions organized by the FIE include the senior World Championships and World Cup, the Junior World Championships and Junior World Cup, the Cadets World Championships, and the Veterans World Championships. The Zonal Championships recognised by the FIE are the Senior Zonal Championships and the
Junior Zonal Championships, but other competitions may be organized by the Zonal Confederations.

The FIE assists the International Olympic Committee in the organization of fencing events at the Summer Olympics. The number of events has been a matter of contention between the FIE and the CIO since the introduction of the women&#x27;s sabre at the 1999 World Championships: since then, the World Championships feature twelve events: an individual and a team weapon for each of the three weapons, for men and for women. However, the CIO refuses to increase the number of Olympic medals allocated to fencing. After much dithering, the FIE decided to organize all six individual events, but only four team events, decided on a rotational basis. The two team events excluded from the Olympic programme, one for men and one for women, are included instead in the World Championships.

As of 2023, the FIE recognized 155 affiliated national federations.
&quot;Note:&quot; , the Netherlands Antilles was still listed as an FIE Member nation, and 146 member nations were listed on the FIE&#x27;s membership page. However, after the country was dissolved, it lost its National Olympic Committee status in 2011. At the 2012 Olympics, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles were eligible to participate as independent athletes under the Olympic flag (no fencers competed).

<doc id="984729" wikidata="Q336357" url="?curid=984729" title="Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat">
<text>Brigadier Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, (9 July 1911 – 16 March 1995) was a prominent British Commando during the Second World War and the 24th Chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat. Known familiarly as Shimi Lovat, an anglicised version of his name in Scottish Gaelic; his clan referred to him as MacShimidh, his Gaelic patronym. During Operation Overlord, he led the Special Service Brigade at Sword Beach and to successfully capture Pegasus Bridge, accompanied by his piper Bill Millin.

==Early life==
Fraser was born at his ancestral home of Beaufort Castle near Beauly, Inverness-shire, the son of Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat (commonly known as the 16th Lord), and Laura, daughter of Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale. After being educated at Ampleforth College (where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps) and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he joined the university&#x27;s Cavalry Squadron, 

Fraser was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Lovat Scouts (a Territorial Army unit) in 1930. On 3 September 1932, he transferred to the Scots Guards, British Army, with seniority in the rank of second lieutenant from 27 August 1931. In both units, he served alongside his cousin Bill Stirling. The following year, Fraser succeeded his father to become the 15th Lord Lovat (referred to as the 17th Lord Lovat) and 25th Chief of the Clan Fraser. He was promoted lieutenant in August 1934. Lovat resigned his regular commission as a lieutenant in 1937, transferring to the Supplementary Reserve of Officers.

He married Rosamond Broughton, the daughter of Sir Henry John Delves Broughton, on 10 October 1938, with whom he had six children. Lord and Lady Lovat lived at Beaufort Castle.

==Second World War==
In June 1939, just months before the Second World War, Lord Lovat also resigned his reserve commission. In July, however, as war approached, he was mobilized as a captain in the Lovat Scouts. In 1940 together with his Stirling cousins (Bill and David) and friends, including Donald Cameron of Lochiel, Lovat planned to create a new unorthodox group of shock fighters (Commandos) who would combine sea, air and land attacks using surprise as a key component. It was essential to use volunteers only. Crucial to the plan was the personal blessing of Winston Churchill, which they duly obtained. Lovat was personally involved in the training of the Commando troops on the West coast of Scotland. He was eventually attached to and led No. 4 Commando. On 3 March 1941, Nos 3 and 4 Commando launched Operation Claymore, a raid on the German-occupied Lofoten Islands. In the successful raid, the commandos destroyed fish-oil factories, petrol dumps, and 11 ships. They also seized encryption equipment and codebooks. As well, the commandos captured 216 German troops; 315 Norwegians chose to accompany the commandos back to Britain.

As a temporary major, Lord Lovat commanded 100 men of No. 4 Commando and a 50-man detachment from the Canadian Carleton and York Regiment in a raid on the French coastal village of Hardelot in April. For this action he was awarded the Military Cross on 7 July 1942. Lord Lovat became an acting lieutenant-colonel in 1942 and was appointed the commanding officer of No. 4 Commando, leading them in a successful component of the abortive Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August. His commando attacked and destroyed a battery of six 150 mm guns. Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

The raid as a whole was a disastrous failure with over 4,000 casualties sustained, predominantly Canadian. Yet No. 4 Commando captured its objectives, the only successful part of the operation, and most of Lovat&#x27;s men returned safely to Britain.

According to Hilary Saunders, the official biographer of the Commandos the men &quot;were to arouse such a passion of hate and fear in the hearts of their enemies that first Von Runstedt and then Hitler in 1942 ordered their slaughter when captured down to the last man. Lovat had 100,000 Reich marks placed on his head, dead or alive. The infamous &quot;Commando Order&quot;.

During the planning of Operation Overlord, in 1944 Lord Lovat was made a brigadier and appointed the Commander of the newly formed 1st Special Service Brigade. Lord Lovat&#x27;s brigade was landed at Sword during the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Lord Lovat probably waded ashore in battle dress; this is contrary to the depiction in the film &quot;The Longest Day&quot; which had him wearing a white jumper under his battledress, with &quot;Lovat&quot; inscribed on the collar while armed with a full stocked Mannlicher-Schoenauer stutzen rifle. This probably harks back to the Dieppe raid where Lovat was armed with a Model 1893 Steyr-Mannlicher. The latter claim is disputed; however, in some earlier pictures he is seen with a bolt-action .30-06 Winchester Model 70 sporting rifle. However, in his memoirs, &#x27;March Past&#x27;, Lovat states that he was armed with a &quot;short barreled U.S. Army carbine&quot; (presumably an M1 carbine) on D-Day.

Lord Lovat instructed his personal piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos and himself ashore, in defiance of orders specifically forbidding such actions in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: &quot;Ah, but that&#x27;s the War Office. You and I are both Scottish, and that doesn&#x27;t apply&quot;.

Lovat&#x27;s forces swiftly pressed on, Lovat himself advancing with parts of his brigade from Sword to Pegasus Bridge, which had been defiantly defended by men of the 2nd Bn the Ox &amp; Bucks Light Infantry (6th Airborne Division) who had landed in the early hours by glider. Lord Lovat&#x27;s commandos arrived at a little past 1 p.m. at Pegasus Bridge though the rendezvous time stipulated in the plan was noon. (A common misconception holds that they arrived almost exactly on time, late by only two and a half minutes.) Upon reaching the rendezvous, Lord Lovat apologised for his unit&#x27;s lateness to Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Pine-Coffin, of 7th Parachute Battalion. He went on to establish defensive positions around Ranville, east of the River Orne. The bridges were relieved later in the day by elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division.

During the Battle of Breville on 12 June, Lord Lovat was seriously wounded whilst observing an artillery bombardment by the 51st Highland Division. A stray shell fell short of its target and landed amongst the officers, killing Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Johnson, commanding officer of the 12th Parachute Battalion, and seriously wounding Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade.

Lovat was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; by a grateful French Fourth Republic.

==Later life==
Lord Lovat was a stalwart of the Inverness Highland aristocracy. In 1942 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (post-nominal &quot;DL&quot;) of the county, and two years later a Justice of the Peace. Lord Lovat made a full recovery from the severe wounds he had received in France but was unable to return to the army (he transferred to the reserve in 1949). In early 1945 Churchill sent him to Moscow as his envoy in a Parliamentary delegation to pay his respect to Stalin and the Presidium. Churchill notes in the final volume of his biography of the Second World War that at the crucial meeting with Stalin and President Roosevelt at Yalta in 1945 when the boundaries of Europe were being discussed Stalin kept coming back again and again, in conversation, to military questions: Stalin said he had acquired a new interest in life, says Churchill, an interest in military affairs. &quot;He liked young military fighters like Lord Lovat&quot;. ref: WC: the Second World War, volume VI, p. 344 Yalta finale. Winston Churchill requested that he become Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in the House of Lords; however, Lord Lovat declined the offer and in 1945 joined the Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, &quot;becoming responsible for the functions of the Ministry of Economic Warfare when these were taken over by the Foreign Office&quot;, resigning upon Winston Churchill&#x27;s election defeat. In 1946 he was made a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John. His formal retirement from the army came on 16 June 1962, he retained the honorary rank of brigadier.

Lord Lovat&#x27;s involvement in politics continued throughout his life, in the House of Lords where he spoke on Scottish Affairs and served in the Inverness County Council for the next forty-two years where he pressed for modernising improvements. He also devoted much of his time to the family estates of 250,000 acres in the highlands and to Fraser Clan affairs. He bred a pedigree herd of shorthorn cattle and was an international judge of cattle travelling widely to Canada, America, Latin America and Australia in that regard. He lectured on agronomy and loved racing. He was chieftain of Lovat Shinty Club, the local shinty team which bears his family name. Lord Lovat experienced a great deal of sadness in his final years; two of his sons predeceased him in accidents within days of each other. In 1994, a year before his death, the family&#x27;s traditional residence, Beaufort Castle, was sold by his eldest son, Simon Fraser, to pay inheritance taxes.

Lord Lovat&#x27;s second son, Kim, played the pipes at Lord Lovat&#x27;s funeral.

==Media==
&quot;The Longest Day&quot;, a 1962 film based on the book of the same name, features &quot;Lord Lovat&quot;, played by Peter Lawford.

There is some suggestion that the charlatan commando character &quot;Trimmer&quot; in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s Sword of Honour trilogy of novels is based on Lovat. Lovat was closely associated with Waugh&#x27;s forced resignation from the Commandos, which is the subject of an exchange of correspondence between them which Waugh pasted into his war diaries. In an article in &quot;Standpoint&quot; magazine, Paul Johnson wrote:
==Family==
Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, Master of Lovat and 15th Lord Lovat (9 July 1911 – 16 March 1995), was the son and eldest child of Simon Joseph Fraser, 14th Baron Lovat (25 November 1871 – 18 February 1933), and the Hon.

The 15th Lord Lovat&#x27;s first son and heir Simon Augustine Fraser, Master of Lovat, and his fourth son Andrew predeceased him in 1994 within days of each other. The 15th Lord Lovat then died a year later in 1995. The title then passed to his grandson Simon Christopher Fraser, who became the 16th Lord Lovat.

<doc id="984731" wikidata="Q414992" url="?curid=984731" title="Neuropeptide Y">
<text>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino-acid neuropeptide that is involved in various physiological and homeostatic processes in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is secreted alongside other neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate. 

In the autonomic system it is produced mainly by neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and serves as a strong vasoconstrictor and also causes growth of fat tissue. In the brain, it is produced in various locations including the hypothalamus, and is thought to have several functions, including: increasing food intake and storage of energy as fat, reducing anxiety and stress, reducing pain perception, affecting the circadian rhythm, reducing voluntary alcohol intake, lowering blood pressure, and controlling epileptic seizures.

== Function ==
Neuropeptide Y has been identified as being synthesized in GABAergic neurons and to act as a neurotransmitter during cellular communication. Neuropeptide Y is expressed in interneurons. NPY exerts most of its effects through Neuropeptide Y receptors, mainly Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y6. All receptors have been indicated as participants in post-synaptic transmission activity, but the Y2 receptor has also been found to be involved in pre-synaptic processing.

The receptor protein that NPY operates on is a G protein-coupled receptor in the rhodopsin like 7-transmembrane GPCR family. Five subtypes of the NPY receptor have been identified in mammals, four of which are functional in humans. Subtypes Y1 and Y5 have known roles in the stimulation of feeding while Y2 and Y4 seem to have roles in appetite inhibition (satiety). Some of these receptors are among the most highly conserved neuropeptide receptors.

High concentrations of neuropeptide Y synthesis and action have been found in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, specifically in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dentate gyrus. The arcuate nucleus has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of NPY. This allows NPY to regulate neuroendocrine release of various hypothalamic hormones such as luteinizing hormone. Neuropeptide Y1 receptors have been found in highest density in the dentate gyrus along with a variety of other brain areas.

NPY is able to modulate the mitochondrial network by affecting the expression of many genes involved in mitochondrial functions and dynamics. It has been found that in breast muscle, ATP production genes (uncoupling protein, &quot;UCP&quot;; nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2, &quot;NFE2L2&quot;) and a dynamics gene (mitofusin 1, &quot;MFN1&quot;) were upregulated (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.05) at a low dose of NPY, while a high dose decreased (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.05) markers of mitochondrial dynamics (mitofusin 2, &quot;MFN2;&quot; OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase, &quot;OPA1&quot;) and increased (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.05) genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (D-loop, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, &quot;PPARG&quot;).

=== Cell growth ===
Neuropeptide Y has been indicated as playing an important role in neurogenesis in various parts of the brain. Two particular brain areas where NPY affects neurogenesis are the sub-ventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These areas are where cell growth and proliferation occur into adulthood.

==== Dentate gyrus ====
The dentate gyrus is significantly involved in cell proliferation, a process modulated by various internal factors including neuropeptide Y. Reduction or elimination of NPY released by interneurons decreased cell growth in this brain area. NPY affects neurogenesis by interacting with ERK kinase signaling pathways. Additionally, NPY acting on and stimulating Y1 receptors present on progenitor cell membranes in order to increase cell proliferation.

==== Sub-ventricular zone ====
Similar to the dentate gyrus, NPY has been found to increase cellular proliferation and differentiation in the sub-ventricular zone by specifically activating Y1 receptors in the ERK1/2 pathway. Additionally, NPY was found in neuronal fibers that pass through the sub-ventricular zone and extend to other brain areas. A variety of other effects and physiological processes involving NPY in the sub-ventricular zone have been discovered, many of which involve neuron migration patterns.

==== Olfactory bulb ====
It was found that after blocking NPY expression in mouse olfactory epithelium, the amount of olfactory precursor cells decreased by half. This in turn caused the mice to develop a lower amount of olfactory cells overall. This study exemplified NPY&#x27;s influence on precursor cells.

==Discovery==

Following the isolation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) from the porcine hypothalamus in 1982, researchers began to speculate about the involvement of NPY in hypothalamic-mediated functions. In a 1983 study, NPY-ergic axon terminals were located in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and the highest levels of NPY immunoreactivity was found within the PVN of the hypothalamus.

Six years later, in 1989, Morris et al. homed in on the location of NPYergic nuclei in the brain. Furthermore, in situ hybridization results from the study showed the highest cellular levels of NPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus.

In 1989, Haas &amp; George reported that local injection of NPY into the PVN resulted in an acute release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the rat brain, proving that NPYergic activity directly stimulates the release and synthesis of CRH.

The latter became a hallmark paper in NPY studies. A significant amount of work had already been done in the 1970s on CRH and its involvement in stress and eating disorders such as obesity. These studies, collectively, marked the beginning for understanding the role of NPY in orexigenesis or food intake.

==Connection to food intake==

Behavioral assays in orexigenic studies, in which rats are the model organism, have been done collectively with immunoassays and in situ hybridization studies to confirm that elevating NPY-ergic activity does indeed increase food intake. In these studies, exogenous NPY, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (which activates NPY in the basomedial hypothalamus), or N-acetyl [Leu 28, Leu31] NPY (24-36) are injected into the third ventricle or at the level of the hypothalamus with a cannula.

Furthermore, these studies unanimously demonstrate that the stimulation of NPYergic activity via the administration of certain NPY agonists increases food intake compared to baseline data in rats. The effects of NPYergic activity on food intake is also demonstrated by the blockade of certain NPY receptors (Y1 and Y5 receptors), which, as was expected, inhibited NPYergic activity; thus, decreases food intake. However, a 1999 study by King et al. demonstrated the effects of the activation of the NPY autoreceptor Y2, which has been shown to inhibit the release of NPY and thus acts to regulate food intake upon its activation. In this study a highly selective Y2 antagonist, BIIE0246 was administered locally into the ARC. Radioimmunoassay data, following the injection of BIIE0246, shows a significant increase in NPY release compared to the control group. Though the pharmacological half-life of exogenous NPY, other agonists, and antagonist is still obscure, the effects are not long lasting and the rat body employs an excellent ability to regulate and normalize abnormal NPY levels and therefore food consumption.

==Connection to obesity==

A study in genetically obese rats demonstrated the role of NPY in obesity. Four underlying factors that contribute to obesity in rats are:

* an increase in glucocorticosteroid concentrations in plasma; 
* insensitivity or resistance to insulin; 
* mutation of leptin receptor; and 
* an increase in NPY mRNA and NPY release.

In obesity chronically elevated levels of NPY can be seen, this has been seen in rats fed on a high fat diet for 22 weeks and resulted in a hormonal derangement that increased NPY release, due to a defective leptin signal compared to control rats. In humans increased levels of free NPY were found in obese women and not in their leaner counterparts, analysing human hypothalamus&#x27; for NPY concentration however is more difficult than rats. During weaning in rats there is an early expression of gene mutations that increase hypothalamic release of NPY in rats, however in humans multiple genes are commonly associated with the results of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In most obesity cases the increased secretion of NPY is a central / hypothalamic resistance to energy excess hormone signals such as leptin, that can be a result of a variety of reasons in the CNS. In rodents resistant to obesity when fed on an obesogenic diet they had a significantly lower amount of NPY receptor in the hypothalamus suggesting an increased activity of NPY neurons in obese rats meaning that the reduction in the release of NPY may be beneficial to the reduction of obesity incidence alongside the consumption of a healthy diet and exercise. This would need to be seen in human research before looking at this avenue of weight loss although currently there is some evidence that suggests NPY is a significant predictor in weight regain after weight loss to maintain old levels of energy storage.

Furthermore, these factors correlate with each other. The sustained high levels of glucocorticosteroids stimulate gluconeogenesis, which subsequently causes an increase of blood glucose that activates the release of insulin to regulate glucose levels by causing its reuptake and storage as glycogen in the tissues in the body. In the case of obesity, which researchers speculate to have a strong genetic and a dietary basis, insulin resistance prevents high blood glucose regulation, resulting in morbid levels of glucose and diabetes mellitus. In addition, high levels of glucocorticosteroids causes an increase of NPY by directly activating type II glucocorticosteroids receptors (which are activated only by relatively high levels of glucocorticosteroids) and, indirectly, by abolishing the negative feedback of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on NPY synthesis and release. Meanwhile, obesity-induced insulin resistance and the mutation of the leptin receptor (ObRb) results in the abolition of inhibition of NPYergic activity and ultimately food intake via other negative feedback mechanisms to regulate them. Obesity in rats was significantly reduced by adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy.

A study showed that neuropeptide Y can be used as a biosensor in early detection of childhood obesity

== Clinical significance ==

===Alcoholism===
The role of neuropeptide Y has gained substantial attention for its involvement with alcoholism due to its diverse range of physiological effects. NPY neurons have been shown to interact with dopaminergic reward and emotion pathways in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, respectively. NPY expression levels and alcohol preference have been shown to exhibit an inverse relationship. Expression levels are dependent on the brain area of interest. This indicates that baseline NPY levels could possibly influence innate alcohol preferences.

Previous studies have identified NPY&#x27;s anxiolytic effects to a possible therapeutic drug target for alcoholism. As stated before, NPY levels and ethanol intake show an inverse relationship, therefore, increasing NPY availability could decrease alcohol intake. By creating a chemical antagonist for a Y2 receptor that would indirectly act as an agonist and stimulate Y1 receptors, alcohol consumption was successfully decreased in rats. Additionally, another similar study identified that NPY expression may be connected to behavioral regulation in relation to alcohol dependence. Administration of neuropeptide Y was found to reduce binge-drinking behavior. Although, it has been shown that NPY gene expression, mRNA or neuropeptide levels are not influenced by long-term alcohol consumption, but changes do occur during withdrawal from alcohol. These findings show that neuropeptide Y has varying effects on alcohol consumption.

Two results suggest that NPY might protect against alcoholism:
* knock-out mice in which a type of NPY receptor has been removed show a higher voluntary intake of alcohol and a higher resistance to alcohol&#x27;s sedating effects, compared to normal mice;
* the common fruit fly has a neuropeptide that is similar to NPY, known as neuropeptide F. The levels of neuropeptide F are lowered in sexually frustrated male flies, and this causes the flies to increase their voluntary intake of alcohol.

=== Stress and anxiety ===
Neuropeptide Y is considered to be an anxiolytic endogenous peptide and its levels can be modulated by stress. NPY has connections to the HPA axis and is believed to be necessary for stress modulation. It has been shown that higher levels of the Y1 and Y5 receptors in the amygdala result in reduced level of anxiety. Additionally, the Y1 receptor has been linked to anxiolytic effects in the forebrain while Y2 has been associated with the pons.

Conversely, higher levels of NPY may be associated with resilience against and recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder and with dampening the fear response, allowing individuals to perform better under extreme stress.

Studies of mice and monkeys show that repeated stress—and a high-fat, high-sugar diet—stimulate the release of neuropeptide Y, causing fat to build up in the abdomen. Researchers believe that by manipulating levels of NPY, they could eliminate fat from areas where it was not desired and accumulate at sites where it is needed.

<doc id="984738" wikidata="Q1431313" url="?curid=984738" title="Little Village">
<text>Little Village was an American/British rock band, formed in 1991 by Ry Cooder (guitar, vocal), John Hiatt (guitar, piano, vocal), Nick Lowe (bass, vocal) and Jim Keltner (drums). Each of the group&#x27;s members had previously worked on Hiatt&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bring The Family&quot;, and formed in 1991 while on a break from their own musical projects.

The group&#x27;s name was initially (and jokingly) announced as Hiatus. It was soon changed to Little Village, in reference to the foul-mouthed in-studio diatribe by Sonny Boy Williamson II, on a Chess reissue album titled &quot;Bummer Road&quot;. The group released its only album, &quot;Little Village&quot;, in early 1992. The songs were composed by all four group members and mainly sung by Hiatt, although Lowe took lead on two songs and Cooder one. While the album was met with general commercial indifference, it was nominated in 1993 for a Grammy Award as &quot;Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or a Group&quot;. The album peaked at No. 23 in the UK Albums Chart.

Nick Lowe later said, &quot;Little Village was really good fun. Unfortunately, the record we did was no good. I suppose on some level, it worked, but Warner Brothers kind of gave us too much time to do it.&quot;

Little Village toured the U.S. and Europe in 1992 to support the album, but the group disbanded later that year.

<doc id="984739" wikidata="Q16950100" url="?curid=984739" title="Mahadharmaraksita">
<text>Mahadharmarakkhita (Sanskrit: &quot;Mahadharmaraksita&quot;, literally &quot;Great protector of the Dharma&quot;) was a Greek (in Pali:&quot;Yona&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;Yavana&quot;, lit. &quot;Ionian&quot;) Buddhist master, who lived during the 2nd century BCE during the reign of the Indo-Greek king Menander.

In the Mahavamsa, a key Pali historical text, he is recorded as having travelled from “Alasandra” (thought to be Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 kilometers north of today&#x27;s Kabul, or possibly Alexandria of the Arachosians), with 30,000 monks for the dedication ceremony of the Maha Thupa (&quot;Great stupa&quot;) at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, when it was completed shortly after the death of the Sri Lankan king Dutthagamani Abhaya (r. 161 - 137 BCE).

The Mahamvasa lists the congregations that visited Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Maha Thupa, explaining that:

:&quot;From Alasanda the city of the Yonas came the thera (elder) Yona Mahadhammarakkhita with thirty thousand bhikkhus.&quot; (Mahavamsa, XXIX)

This reference is seen as having several implications regarding the role of the Greeks in the Buddhist community at that time:

* Alexandria of the Caucasus or Alexandria of the Arachosians, cities under the control of the Greek king Menander, had a Buddhist monk population of possibly as many as 30,000, indicating a flourishing Buddhist culture under the Greeks.
* The head of this Buddhist community was a Greek (Yona) Buddhist elder whose religious name was Mahadhammarakkhita (&quot;Great protector of the Dharma), indicating the direct involvement of Greeks in the development of the faith, in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
* They were able to travel unhindered south as far as Sri Lanka, indicating some kind of stable political situation along the west coast of the Indian subcontinent, especially at a time when the Shunga Empire in the east was persecuting Buddhists.

It is also separately established through another text, the Milinda Panha, and archeological evidence that Menander himself ruled a vast empire in northern India, and that he became a Buddhist arhat. According to Buddhist tradition he was a great benefactor of the Buddhist faith, on a par with Ashoka or the Kushan Kanishka.

He was also a member of the External Research Advisory Committee of the UNHCR and the Advisory Committee of the Lessons-Learned Unit of the Department of Peace-Keeping Operations (UN). He is a member of Council of Foreign Relations, New York.

===Kant&#x27;s Perpetual Peace===
In his 1983 essay &quot;Kant, Liberal Legacies and Foreign Affairs&quot;, Doyle builds on Immanuel Kant&#x27;s views on various issues; especially noted are his views on liberal internationalism. Doyle discusses the two legacies of modern liberalism: the pacification of foreign relations among liberal states (see below) and international imprudence.

===Awards and honors===
In 2001, Doyle was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and, in 2009, to the American Philosophical Society. In 2009, he received the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Charles E. Merriam Award, which is biennially given to &quot;a person whose published work and career represent a significant contribution to the art of government through the application of social science research.&quot; In 2011, Doyle received the Hubert H. Humphrey Award from the American Political Science Association for &quot;notable public service by a political scientist.&quot; In 2012, he was named the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Fellow of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. In 2014, he received an honorary degree from the University of Warwick.

===Public service===
Doyle served as Assistant Secretary-General and Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In the Secretary General&#x27;s Executive Office, he was responsible for strategic planning, including the Millennium Development Goals, outreach to the international corporate sector through the Global Compact, and relations with Washington. He is the former chair of the Academic Council on the United Nations System.

He was also the chair of United Nations Democracy Fund from 2007 to 2013, elected by the members and appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

=== Model International Mobility Convention ===
As the director of the Columbia Global Policy Initiative&#x27;s, Doyle convened the group of experts who developed the Model International Mobility Convention.

Now a Carnegie Council project, MIMC is building a Network that will encourage support for and develop the convention in order to address emerging international mobility challenges, including pandemic disease and climate stress.

The Model International Mobility Convention fills a gap in international law by covering the multiple forms of international mobility, ranging from visitors through labor migrants to forced migrants and refugees. It proposes a comprehensive framework for international mobility with the goal of establishing a cumulative set of rights afforded to internationally mobile people (and the corresponding rights and responsibilities of states).

==Personal life==
Doyle is married to Amy Gutmann, US Ambassador to Germany and the former President of the University of Pennsylvania. Their daughter, Abigail Doyle, is a professor of chemistry at UCLA.

<text>Interstate 895 (I-895) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Maryland. Known as the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, the highway runs between one junction with I-95 in Elkridge and another interchange with I-95 on the east side of Baltimore. I-895 is a toll road that crosses the Patapsco River estuary via the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1), I-695, and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (B–W Parkway) in the southwestern suburbs of Baltimore with US 40 on the east side of Baltimore. In conjunction with a pair of spurs, unsigned I-895A and I-895B, I-895 provides access to the tunnel from I-97 and Maryland Route 2 (MD 2) in Glen Burnie. The highway is designed for through traffic by having partial interchanges that require vehicles from almost all starting points (with the two northernmost exits being exceptions) to pass through the tunnel and the tunnel toll plaza, where a $1.40-$6.00 toll is charged to passenger vehicles, before exiting the facility.

The idea of a crossing of the Patapsco River south of Downtown Baltimore had been studied since the 1930s. In the early 1950s, the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) chose to construct a four-lane tunnel between the Canton and Fairfield neighborhoods of Baltimore and approach highways to connect the tunnel with major highways to Washington, D.C.; Annapolis; Richmond, Virginia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The tunnel and approach highways were constructed beginning in 1955 and opened in November 1957, opening a bottleneck for Baltimore through traffic, which formerly had to navigate the city streets. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was connected with the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in the early 1960s and the portion of I-95 south to Washington DC in the early 1970s. With these connections, I-895 was burdened with most of the through traffic passing through Baltimore. The congestion was not resolved until I-95 through Baltimore was completed when the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel opened in November 1985. The transfer of most traffic to the new tunnel allowed the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel to be partially shut down for extensive maintenance in the late 1980s.

In 2024, I-895 was designated a main detour route for through non-hazmat traffic in the wake of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.

==Route description==
I-895 is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) and, like all Interstate Highways, is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length.

===Western approach===

I-895 begins at exit 46 of I-95 in Elkridge with single-lane flyover ramps from northbound I-95 to I-895 and from I-895 to southbound I-95. The highway, which has a speed limit of , expands to four lanes on a viaduct over local roads and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Capital Subdivision railroad line and MARC Train&#x27;s Camden Line. I-895 crosses the Patapsco River (the Howard–Baltimore county line) and US 1 (Washington Boulevard), then receives the exit 1 flyover ramps from northbound US 1 and to southbound US 1 before passing under I-195 with no access. I-895 continues east parallel to the Patapsco River. The highway passes along the southern edge of Halethorpe, where it crosses Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line and MARC Train&#x27;s Penn Line along with Herbert Run.

I-895 meets I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at exit 3, which includes a loop ramp from eastbound I-695 and a ramp to westbound I-695. The highway crosses Hammonds Ferry Road in Baltimore Highlands before exit 4 with MD 295 (B–W Parkway), which includes a loop ramp to southbound MD 295 and a ramp from northbound MD 295. The speed limit drops to , then the highway crosses MD 648 (Annapolis Road) and curves northeast across marshland, the main line of the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)&#x27;s Baltimore Light RailLink, and the Patapsco River into Anne Arundel County. East of the river, I-895 receives flyover ramps from the thruway&#x27;s southern approach, unsigned I-895B, at exit 6 in Brooklyn Park.

The highway enters the city of Baltimore and curves to the east over Patapsco Avenue before exit 7 with MD 2 (Potee Street), which includes a loop ramp to southbound MD 2 and a ramp from the intersection of MD 2 and MD 173 (Patapsco Avenue). I-895 parallels CSX Transportation&#x27;s Curtis Bay Branch as the highway passes along the northern edge of the Brooklyn neighborhood. The highway crosses the Curtis Bay Branch on a steel K-truss bridge ahead of exits 8A and 8B. Exit 8A includes a loop ramp to and a flyover ramp from Shell Road, which heads toward the Curtis Bay neighborhood. Exit 8B includes ramps from eastbound Frankfurst Avenue and to westbound Frankfurst Avenue; that street leads to Hanover Street and Downtown Baltimore. I-895 passes through the 14-booth toll plaza for the tunnel; immediately to the east of the toll plaza is exit 9, a half diamond interchange with Childs Street for traffic to and from the toll plaza. The speed limit decreases to as the highway curves to the northeast through the Fairfield unit of the Port of Baltimore and descends into the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel.

===Northern approach===

I-895 surfaces from the tunnel adjacent to the toll plaza for the Fort McHenry Tunnel within the Canton neighborhood. The highway passes over several rail lines of the Canton Railroad and several streets as it curves to the north. The exit 10 ramp to Holabird Avenue diverges from I-895 immediately before the highway passes under I-95 with no access. I-895 returns to ground level and the highway crosses Ponca and Boston streets; the speed limit increases to ahead of exits 11A and 11B, which serve Boston and O&#x27;Donnell streets, respectively (with ramps to/from eastbound Boston Street and loop ramps to/from westbound O&#x27;Donnell Street). The highway crosses a rail line before passing through the Greektown neighborhood in a cut. I-895 passes under MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) ahead of exit 12, a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Lombard Street just to the west of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center that has ramps in both directions of the Interstate, and is the only interchange to be built out that way.

The highway veers northeast and crosses both Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Philadelphia Subdivision railroad lines before exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue); the entrance ramp extends from the US 40–MD 151 partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the north and west. After crossing Herring Run, I-895 meets Moravia Road at exit 14, a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange that lacks an exit from northbound I-895, which is accessed via exit 13 and a loop ramp to the northwest. This interchange complements exit 60 off I-95, where the eastern terminus of Moravia Road meets the planned western terminus of the Windlass Freeway. A branch of the I-95 Express Toll Lanes begin within the interchange with Moravia Road, there are ramps from northbound I-895 to the northbound toll lanes, and from the southbound toll lanes to southbound I-895. The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), a pair of flyover ramps from I-895 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to I-895 on the boundary between the city of Baltimore and the Baltimore County community of Rosedale.

==History==

===Planning and construction===

In 1938, the SRC commissioned an engineering study, Maryland&#x27;s Primary Bridge Program, to examine feasibility of major bridges across significant transportation barriers, including a bridge crossing the Patapsco River southeast of the Inner Harbor. Another study in 1944 examined the idea of a bridge with limited-access approach roads running from US 1 in Elkridge to the Patapsco River crossing and from the bridge to US 40 near Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore. The financial resources for the project were established in 1947 when the Maryland General Assembly passed an act allowing for the pooling of revenue bonds and toll receipts between the state&#x27;s toll facilities—the existing Potomac River and Susquehanna River bridges, and the upcoming Chesapeake Bay Bridge—to finance the construction of the Patapsco River Crossing. Finally, a 1953 study examined three different routes—Canton–Fairfield, Canton–Fort McHenry, and a Canton–Fort McHenry–Fairfield dual crossing option—and whether the crossing should be a bridge or tunnel.

In 1954, the SRC decided to construct a tunnel between Canton and Fairfield, with three approach highways: a west approach from US 1 in Elkridge, a south approach from MD 2 in Glen Burnie to connect with the west approach in Brooklyn Park, and a north approach from US 40 and Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore. The approach highways were to be limited-access with directional, partial interchanges so that only traffic intending to use the tunnel would use the approach roads. Any vehicles entering an approach road would not be able to exit until having passed through the tunnel and the tunnel toll facility.

Shortly after work began on the Patapsco Tunnel Project on April 7, 1955, several changes were made to the plans for the approach highways. The northern terminus at US 40 was altered to allow an extension from US 40 to the southern end of the future Northeastern Expressway (now the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway). As a result, additional connections with US 40 were planned for the area around present day exit 14. In addition, the south approach was to have a tie-in to the Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) then under construction. The tunnel and approach highways were completed and opened November 29, 1957, as the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, respectively. The opening of the tunnel and approach roads removed a significant amount of traffic from the streets of Baltimore and eliminated 51 traffic lights from the route of motorists passing through the city.

===Improvements and relief===
The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended north to the city limits of Baltimore to seamlessly connect with the Northeastern Expressway when that highway opened northeast to the Baltimore Beltway in 1961. In 1969, Moravia Road was extended east to US 40 using the connector between US 40 and the thruway and several ramps were added to that road&#x27;s interchanges with US 40 and the thruway. In addition, flyover ramps were constructed at the city limits for I-95 to diverge from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway onto its own path through east Baltimore in 1970. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended at its south end in 1973 to connect with I-95 shortly after that Interstate was completed between the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore Beltway in 1971.

Since I-95 had not yet been completed through Baltimore, the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, which was designated I-895 in 1979, was the main route for traffic passing through Baltimore. As a result, the highway was very congested, and travel through Baltimore had once again become a bottleneck. Relief came with the completion of the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-95 on November 23, 1985. With most traffic diverted to the new tunnel, major reconstruction work began on the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. Traffic was reduced to one lane in each direction through the tunnel as each of the two tubes was renovated between 1987 and 1989. More recent changes include the elimination of the entrance ramp from Ponca Street at exit 10, the expansion of exit 12 to a full interchange (the only full interchange along the route other than its termini at I-95) to provide access to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in both directions (thus shortening the toll portion of I-895), and the reconstruction of the northern interchange with I-95 in 2009 so I-895 enters and exits I-95 on the right side of the roadway; previously, I-95 exited itself southbound by forcing traffic to weave to the right and access a flyover ramp, and northbound I-895 merged with I-95 from the left.

The Canton Viaduct, a elevated structure carrying I-895 over a railroad yard, Ponca Street and the ramps connecting I-95 to Keith Avenue, was replaced in the late 2010s and early 2020s. The project was announced in 2014. The viaduct, next to the toll plaza for the Fort McHenry Tunnel, was one of the oldest Interstate bridges in Maryland. Similar to what was done in the late 1980s rehabilitation of the tunnel, one side of the viaduct was closed while the other operated with one lane in each direction. Construction started in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021.

===Tolls and exit numbers===
The original toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway was $0.40 (equivalent to $ in ) for passenger vehicles and $0.85 (equivalent to $ in ) for trucks. By 1985, the toll had risen to $1.00 (equivalent to $ in ). Electronic toll collection began at the toll plaza in 1999 for M-TAG customers; the M-TAG system was absorbed by E-ZPass in 2001. The MDTA increased the toll for passenger vehicles to $2.00 (equivalent to $ in ) in 2003. In May 2011, the agency announced the toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway and the two other harbor crossings would increase to $3.00 (equivalent to $ in ) on October 1, 2011, and to $4.00 (equivalent to $ in ) on July 1, 2013.

The Harbor Tunnel Thruway has had three different exit number systems throughout its existence. The first numbering scheme was in place by 1963. The northbound exits were numbered between 1 (Holabird Avenue) and 5 (US 40), while the southbound exits were numbered 1 (Hanover Street) to 7 (US 1). The second numbering scheme, which did not change the interchange numbers on the northern approach to the tunnel, was introduced in 1971. The exits on the western approach were renumbered 11 (Hanover Street) to 17 (US 1). Under both schemes, the Childs Street exit did not have a number and the Moravia Road interchange was numbered as exit 1 of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. The third and present numbering scheme was enacted in 1991.

==Exit list==







==Auxiliary routes==
I-895 has two unsigned auxiliary routes, I-895A and I-895B. Both highways are portions of the southern approach to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel that connects with the mainline of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway in Brooklyn Park. Both spurs are maintained by MdTA. I-895A and the portion of I-895B north of I-895A are part of the main National Highway System. The segment of I-895B between MD 2 and I-895A is a National Highway System principal arterial.

===I-895A===
I-895A is the designation for the connector between the northern end of I-97 just north of I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) and I-895B within Glen Burnie. The highway was constructed in 1957 to connect the northern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass with the Harbor Tunnel Thruway. In conjunction with the reconstruction of I-97&#x27;s interchange with I-695, in which the loop ramp from I-97 north to I-695 west was replaced with a flyover joining I-695 on the left, a loop ramp was added on I-895A in 1995 to allow access to the right side of I-695 west for traffic exiting at MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard).

===I-895B===

I-895B is the designation for the southern approach to the mainline of Harbor Tunnel Thruway between MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Glen Burnie and I-895 in Brooklyn Park. The highway was completed in 1957 with the remainder of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway. The only change to the southern approach is the addition of ramps from I-895B north to I-695 west and from I-695 east to I-895B south to improve access between MD 2 and the Baltimore Beltway; these ramps, now marked as exit 3A on I-695 east, were completed in 1968.

<doc id="984752" wikidata="Q1028945" url="?curid=984752" title="Lyapunov equation">
<text>The Lyapunov equation, named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov, is a matrix equation used in the stability analysis of linear dynamical systems. 

In particular, the discrete-time Lyapunov equation (also known as Stein equation) for formula_1 is 
:formula_2
where formula_3 is a Hermitian matrix and formula_4 is the conjugate transpose of formula_5, while the continuous-time Lyapunov equation is 
:formula_6.

==Application to stability==
In the following theorems formula_7, and formula_8 and formula_3 are symmetric. The notation formula_10 means that the matrix formula_8 is positive definite.

Theorem (continuous time version). Given any formula_12, there exists a unique formula_10 satisfying formula_14 if and only if the linear system formula_15 is globally asymptotically stable. The quadratic function formula_16 is a Lyapunov function that can be used to verify stability.

Theorem (discrete time version). Given any formula_12, there exists a unique formula_10 satisfying formula_19 if and only if the linear system formula_20 is globally asymptotically stable. As before, formula_21 is a Lyapunov function.

==Computational aspects of solution==

The Lyapunov equation is linear; therefore, if formula_1 contains formula_23 entries, the equation can be solved in formula_24 time using standard matrix factorization methods.

However, specialized algorithms are available which can yield solutions much quicker owing to the specific structure of the Lyapunov equation. For the discrete case, the Schur method of Kitagawa is often used. For the continuous Lyapunov equation the Bartels–Stewart algorithm can be used.

==Analytic solution==
Defining the vectorization operator formula_25 as stacking the columns of a matrix formula_5 and formula_27 as the Kronecker product of formula_5 and formula_29, the continuous time and discrete time Lyapunov equations can be expressed as solutions of a matrix equation. Furthermore, if the matrix formula_5 is &quot;stable&quot;, the solution can also be expressed as an integral (continuous time case) or as an infinite sum (discrete time case).

===Discrete time===
Using the result that formula_31, one has
:formula_32
where formula_33 is a conformable identity matrix and formula_34 is the element-wise complex conjugate of formula_5. One may then solve for formula_36 by inverting or solving the linear equations. To get formula_1, one must just reshape formula_38 appropriately.

Moreover, if formula_5 is stable (in the sense of Schur stability, i.e., having eigenvalues with magnitude less than 1), the solution formula_1 can also be written as
:formula_41.

For comparison, consider the one-dimensional case, where this just says that the solution of formula_42 is 
:formula_43.

===Continuous time===
Using again the Kronecker product notation and the vectorization operator, one has the matrix equation
:formula_44
where formula_34 denotes the matrix obtained by complex conjugating the entries of formula_5.

Similar to the discrete-time case, if formula_5 is stable (in the sense of Hurwitz stability, i.e., having eigenvalues with negative real parts), the solution formula_1 can also be written as
:formula_49,
which holds because
:formula_50

For comparison, consider the one-dimensional case, where this just says that the solution of formula_51 is 
:formula_52.

== Relationship Between Discrete and Continuous Lyapunov Equations ==

We start with the continuous-time linear dynamics:

:formula_53.

And then discretize it as follows:

:formula_54

Where formula_55 indicates a small forward displacement in time. Substituting the bottom equation into the top and shuffling terms around, we get a discrete-time equation for formula_56.

formula_57

Where we&#x27;ve defined formula_58. Now we can use the discrete time Lyapunov equation for formula_59:

formula_60

Plugging in our definition for formula_59, we get:

formula_62

Expanding this expression out yields:

formula_63

Recall that formula_64 is a small displacement in time. Letting formula_64 go to zero brings us closer and closer to having continuous dynamics—and in the limit we achieve them. It stands to reason that we should also recover the continuous-time Lyapunov equations in the limit as well. Dividing through by formula_64 on both sides, and then letting formula_67 we find that:

formula_68

which is the continuous-time Lyapunov equation, as desired.

<text>Burchetts Green is a small village to the west of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire. It is half in the civil parish of Hurley and half in the civil parish of Bisham. The Berkshire College of Agriculture is located there and includes Hall Place, which was built in 1728 by William East, a wealthy London lawyer. Burchetts Green School was originally built as a chapel in 1868 on land donated by the Clayton-East family. It is an infant school with around 50 pupils. There are three churches in the parish, as well as a Michelin starred pub, The Crown, which in 2017 was voted 10th in Estrella Damm&#x27;s top 50 gastro pubs in the United Kingdom.

<text>The tin mining industry on Dartmoor, Devon, England, is thought to have originated in pre-Roman times, and continued right through to the 20th century, when the last commercially worked mine (Golden Dagger Mine) closed in November 1930 (though it saw work during the Second World War), and &quot;composite mines&quot; such as those producing tin as a by- product, such as Hemerdon Mine in Plympton continue to operate today. From the 12th century onwards tin mining was regulated by a stannary parliament which had its own laws.

Tin is smelted from cassiterite, a mineral found in hydrothermal veins in granite, and the uplands of Dartmoor were a particularly productive area. The techniques used for the extraction of tin from Dartmoor followed a progression from streaming through open cast mining to underground mining. Today, there are extensive archaeological remains of these three phases of the industry, as well as of the several stages of processing that were necessary to convert the ore to tin metal.

==Stannary law==

Mining became such an important part of life in the region that as early as the 12th century, tin miners developed their own set of laws (stannary law) and, ultimately, their own parliaments (stannary parliaments). These laws applied to anyone involved in the industry.

Stannaries were established in Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford by King Edward I in 1305. Plympton followed soon after. The Devon stannary parliament met in an open-air forum at Crockern Tor from 1494.

Anyone who broke a stannary law could find himself imprisoned in the gaol at Lydford. The stannary courts were abolished in 1836.

==Geology==
The majority of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock and most of the lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In the southern part of the moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.
==Mining methods==

===Streaming===

The earliest means of recovery, known as streaming or streamworking, involved the collection of alluvial deposits from river and stream beds where they had accumulated after being eroded from the ore-bearing lodes. The geological processes that resulted in the deposition of the cassiterite in the stream beds often resulted in very pure tin gravel which was mixed with gravels of other, unwanted, minerals such as quartz, mica and feldspar, collectively known as gangue. It was relatively easy to separate these minerals on the basis of their very different specific gravities – cassiterite about 7 and gangue 3 or less. The separation was performed by passing a stream of water over the gravels: the gangue would be washed away faster than the wanted tin gravel.

Once a tin-bearing valley had been identified, the stream-workers would arrange a stream of water, probably carried by a leat from higher up the valley, and starting at the lowest end of the deposit they would dig a trench (known as the &quot;tye&quot;) as deep as possible to allow the finer gangue to be washed away. From there they would start working up the valley, using the stream of water to wash over the debris they had loosened from the bed with picks. This method of working leaves characteristic evidence in the valleys - a series of ridges of the larger gangue material, sometimes roughly perpendicular to, sometimes coaxial with the line of the valley, sometimes apparently haphazard, all bounded by a scarp which marked the edge of the worked ground and whose height relates to the depth of the deposits.

Eluvial deposits—those that had weathered from the lode in the usual way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits due to the lack of sorting that a stream provides, and they usually did not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.

A study has shown that a phase of aggradation occurred in the Erme valley between the 4th century and 7th century, providing evidence of late Roman or early post-Roman tin mining activity in this valley. The same study confirmed what documentary evidence also relates: that there was a boom in tin production in the 13th century. The earliest written record of tin streaming comes from the 12th century.

===Open cast===
By the 15th century, the sources of stream tin were becoming scarce and since the demand for tin was as strong as ever, the direct working of lodes was considered viable despite the greater effort needed in both extraction and refining. &quot;Beamworks&quot; was the name given by the tinners to workings where the lode was followed by digging down from the surface, and the massive gullies that resulted remain prominent features of the moor today. Several of these gullies retain names that include the word &quot;beam&quot;: Gibby Beam, Willabeam and Scudley Beam, for example. They are also known as &quot;openworks&quot; or &quot;gerts&quot;.

Another method of surface mining involved digging pits at intervals along the lode – this was known as &quot;lodeback-work&quot;. At times these pits were dug in pairs along the back of the lode and the lode followed underground between them. This may have been the precursor to beamworks in a number of locations, but enough lodeback pits survive to indicate that it was a separate technique. The issue that mine managers had to decide was whether it was worth removing the extra overburden to form a gulley in order to be able to mine deeper into the lode.

In a similar fashion to streamworking, much use was made of water for the removal of the overburden and gangue. When digging large gullies the overburden, which consisted at least partly of decomposed granite (&quot;growan&quot;), was loosened with picks, and then water was used to wash away the unwanted material instead of manhandling it. Means of collecting, diverting and storing water were always associated with openworks. In some cases when only poor sources of water were available complex systems of reservoirs were built.

===Underground===
The Dartmoor tin industry declined in importance during the early 18th century and had fallen to nothing by 1730. This was due to a number of factors, but the most important was likely to be the exhaustion of the easily accessible deposits. It was not until the Industrial Revolution fuelled demand for all metals and also provided the technology to mine them that mining resumed on the moor on any scale.

Although underground mining technology had been available for many centuries, it is likely that the joint problems of the hardness of the granite rock and the preponderance of underground water together with the relatively easy pickings from near the surface made deep mining unviable until the late 18th century.

Many small mining enterprises started up on Dartmoor in the late 18th and 19th centuries – 48 mines are known to have produced some tin during this period. Many of these ventures were unsuccessful, despite being given optimistic names like Wheal Fortune, Wheal Lucky and Wheal Prosper (the common prefix &quot;Wheal&quot; is a Celtic word meaning &quot;mine&quot; or &quot;works&quot;). Some larger mines, however, such as Eylesbarrow and the Vitifer – Birch Tor complex were productive for many years.

Almost all of the underground mines re-worked lodes that had already been mined from the surface. Because of the great quantity of underground water, it was necessary to dig horizontal adits into the hillsides to de-water the mines. Dartmoor&#x27;s topography, cut with deep valleys, helped there and in many cases it was possible to dig to a reasonable depth without the need to pump out water. These adits connected with shafts that were either sunk vertically downwards or followed the line of the steeply dipping lode. Working the lode then took place by stoping from the horizontal levels in the usual manner.

When it became necessary to go deeper than the lowest adit, it was essential to pump out the water. Large waterwheels were used for this and where the shaft was higher than a good water supply, the waterwheel was located lower down the hillside and the power transferred up to the shaft by a &quot;flatrod&quot; system. Evidence for these systems survives as double rows of stones with grooves on their tops – these held the pulleys that guided the metal rods. Such stone rows are still visible at Eylesbarrow and at Hexworthy.

The discovery of extensive tin deposits in Malaya in the later 19th century had a major impact on the Dartmoor industry, and many miners emigrated. The last tin mine on Dartmoor eventually closed just before the Second World War, although Hemerdon Mine, or Hemerdon Ball, was mined for tungsten and tin on a trial basis in the 1980s, leading to the re-opening this mine with first production in 2015.

==Processing==
After collection the tin ore had to be crushed, concentrated and then smelted. Over time a series of ever more sophisticated processes were used for these operations.

===Crushing===

Early streamworkers operating on a small scale used a block of hard stone as a mortar and perhaps a metalbound piece of wood or a ball of stone as a pestle to break up the ore when necessary, but the rich gravels would have required little or no crushing before concentration. A later technique called &quot;crazing&quot; employed a pair of circular stones used like millstones, the top one rotating on the fixed lower stone. The coarse gravel or crushed ore was introduced into a hole in the centre of the top stone and was rendered to a fine sand. Only three examples of such crazing mills have been found; at Gobbet mine both stones are still visible.

As it became necessary to regularly process pieces of ore-bearing rock that were too large to be directly ground in a crazing mill, stamping was introduced. This involved vertical hammers powered by a waterwheel in a Stamp mill, of which at least 60 are known to have existed on Dartmoor. The first documentary evidence for a stamping mill on Dartmoor is dated 1504, though they would almost certainly have been in use earlier than this (the first reference for Cornwall is from 1400, for instance). Stamping mills were also known as &quot;knacking&quot; or &quot;knocking&quot; mills; Knacking Mill Gulf, a shallow side valley in the upper reaches of the River Erme, attests to the existence of such a mill there at one time.
The hammers or &quot;stamps&quot; in a stamping mill consisted of vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams attached to the waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone. There were usually two or three of these stamps in a row, powered by the same drive and operating in sequence. At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the stamp heads were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the crushed ore once it was just fine enough to pass through the grill. This was a vast improvement over dry stamping because it was a continuous process that also stopped the production of unwanted very fine dust.

The characteristic indicator of a former stamping mill is the mortarstone. These are blocks of granite up to a metre long with flat faces bearing two, three or (rarely) four circular or elliptical hollows usually around 17 cm in diameter and up to about 10 cm deep. Many of these mortarstones have hollows on more than one face, showing that they were turned and reused once the hollows became too deep for effective stamping.
Improvements to the technology in the 18th and 19th centuries involved increasing the number of stamping heads and replacing the granite mortarstone with a thick bed of crushed quartz contained in a masonry or iron box. By the 1900s there were several different types of stamps in use: Cornish, Californian, Holman&#x27;s Pneumatic, etc.

===Concentration===
Although individual grains or pebbles of alluvial tin collected by streaming were often of high purity it was usually still necessary to remove the unwanted &quot;gangue&quot; material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as dressing the ore, increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted tin ore and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, trommels, and even magnetic separation.

An early separation method was the rectangular buddle which was simply a slightly inclined plane over which the crushed material was washed by a gentle stream of water. The heavier ore would settle near the top of the incline while the lighter material would settle lower down or be washed off the buddle altogether. As there was a gradation in quality from the top to the bottom, the mineworker&#x27;s skill lay in deciding where to make the dividing line between the wanted material and the waste. The division was often made in three parts: the &quot;heads&quot;, which represented the best quality ore; the &quot;middles&quot;, which was often reprocessed; and the &quot;tailings&quot;, which was dumped.
From about 1848 a circular form of the buddle was introduced. The crushed ore, suspended in water was introduced onto a central cone and spread outwards over a slightly inclined conical surface. The &quot;heads&quot; would settle near the centre and the &quot;tailings&quot; at the outer edge. The main innovation of the circular buddle was a set of sweep arms, powered by a waterwheel, which rotated above the buddle and carried brushes or pieces of fabric that dragged across the surface of the settling deposits. By continuously disturbing the surface of the deposit, these stopped the formation of rivulets and allowed better separation to be obtained. The buddle would be run until the deposit built up to between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm.) deep. The deposits would then be dug out in three portions, the &quot;middles&quot; often being reprocessed in another buddle of a slightly different specification.

===Smelting===
The earliest method of liberating the metal from the tin ore necessitated two smeltings: the first was done at or near the streamworks and involved no more than a fire used to roast the ore; the second smelting was done at one of the Stannary towns. Little is known of the details of these practices, but their existence is confirmed by early documents that mention taxation of first and second smeltings. The introduction of the efficient blowing house process in around 1300 allowed the use of just one smelting. Later still reverberatory furnaces were used. Both types were in use at Eylesbarrow mine in the first half of the 19th century—the last place on Dartmoor where smelting was done.

==Consequences==
The effects of the large scale of early tin streaming were felt on the coast, as several harbours silted up due to the amount of fine material that was washed down the rivers. Because of this, in 1532 a Stannary Court decree ordained that all rubbish should be deposited in &quot;old Hatches, Tipittes, miry Places, or other convenient Places&quot; away from the main streams.

The impact of mining on the Dartmoor landscape is still clear to see. Walkers on the moor will often stumble upon ruined blowing houses and mortar stones, featuring rows of semi-circular depressions, in which the ore was crushed. Many of the later mine shafts have now been filled in, but a few do still remain, fenced off to prevent walkers or animals from falling in.

==Three hares symbol==
The three hares is a circular motif which appears in sacred sites from the Middle and Far East to the churches of south west England (where it is often referred to as the &quot;Tinners’ Rabbits&quot;). It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of the West Country of England. The motif appears in architectural wood carving, stone carving, window tracery and stained glass. In South Western England there are nearly thirty recorded examples of the Three Hares appearing on &#x27;roof bosses&#x27; (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in medieval churches in Devon, (particularly Dartmoor). There is a good example of a roof boss of the Three hares at Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Dartmoor, with another in the town of Tavistock on the edge of the moor.

Tinners&#x27; Rabbits is the name of a dance of many forms involving use of sticks and rotation of three, six or nine dancers.

<text>Titan is a 1997 science fiction novel by British writer Stephen Baxter. The book depicts a crewed mission to Titan—the enigmatic moon of Saturn—which has a thick atmosphere and a chemical makeup that some think may contain the building blocks of life. &quot;Titan&quot; was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1998.

==Plot summary==
The novel explores a range of possible attitudes toward space exploration and science in the early twenty-first century in which he lays down his concerns about anti-intellectualism and the loss of the pioneering spirit in modern American politics and culture. In &quot;Titan&quot;, the United States is ruled by a patriotic President named Xavier Maclachlan who, believing Earth is the centre of the universe, orders the equal treatment of the Ptolemaic model of the Solar System in high school curricula, all the while youth culture goes into a rebellious downward spiral with the widespread adoption of digital entertainment technology. Due to its far-right isolationist policies, the United States have severed ties with the rest of the world (including within themselves with seceding nation-states), especially while tensions grow with the emerging power of China, which is engaged in a determined bid to gain control of space after the American Shuttle program comes crashing down with the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; (but not in the same way as actual events. In this timeline, instead of disintegrating on re-entry the shuttle makes an irreparable crash landing with the loss of two of the crew), and NASA has no public or political support to help recover from the accident. Consequently, under the militaristic Maclachlan&#x27;s executive plans, the US military merges with the space agency for its resources to be diverted into defence spending, including using its space-faring vehicles as weapons platforms and forcing NASA to develop ethnically targeted biological weapons tailored to attack the Chinese.

Amid this negative climate and seeing no future for themselves after the permanent shutdown of the space program or for the decadent future of humanity, a small team of scientists and astronauts consisting of Paula Bencerraf, a survivor of the Columbia disaster, Isaac Rosenberg, a JPL scientist, Siohban Libet and Nicola Mott, two International Space Station astronauts and lovers, and Bill Angel, an astronaut, must persuade NASA to fund a crewed mission to Titan to confirm findings of life from the &quot;Cassini&quot; and to rejuvenate interest in space exploration to the world. They do so by recycling older spacecraft for several purposes: space shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; is refitted to carry cargo into orbit as well as a restored Saturn V for construction of the main ship (a heavily modified version of &quot;Discovery&quot; using the Shuttle OMS engines for chemical propulsion and powered by a TOPAZ nuclear reactor), using habitat modules from the mothballed International Space Station, and Apollo re-entry capsules are adapted to become Titan landers. On the day of the last launch to begin the mission, with the shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; ready to carry the crew to space, an insane USAF general driven by shallow militarism and hatred for space exploration tries to shoot down the shuttle during lift off. Despite damage sustained from an anti-satellite missile fired from a restored X-15, &quot;Endeavour&quot; successfully makes it into orbit, and the five crew members begin their six-year journey to Saturn by using a chain of Gravity assist similar to that used by Cassini.

En route, Siohban Libet, one of the astronauts, dies after a solar storm. The use of a CELSS greenhouse for life support provides a continuous food supply, and the astronauts rely on vegetables, grain and fruit from the greenhouse as they travel on, and recycle waste via supercritical water oxidation. But things take a dark turn as funding and support for resupply and Earth-return retrieval are cut by Maclachlan&#x27;s administration (proposed and carried out by the very same men that tried to shoot the shuttle down), leaving the team with no hope for survival beyond what they may find on Titan. Once they reach Saturn and prepare to land on Titan&#x27;s surface, another crew member is lost during the landing procedure with another effectively crippled. Titan is discovered to be a bleak, freezing dwarf-planet containing liquid ethane oceans, a sticky mud-like surface composed of tholins, and a climate which includes a thick atmosphere of purple organic compounds falling like snow from the clouds; and the only traces of life they find are fossilised remains of microbic bacteria similar to those recovered from Martian meteorites. The remaining astronauts relay their findings back to a largely uninterested Earth.

Meanwhile, the Chinese, to retaliate for biological attacks by the US, send an astronaut (incidentally the first Chinese to go into space) to cause a huge explosion next to an asteroid (2002OA) in a suicide attack, with the aim of deflecting it into Earth orbit and threatening the world with targeted precision strikes in the future. Unfortunately, their calculations are wrong as they didn&#x27;t take into account the size of the asteroid which could cause a Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The asteroid strikes Earth, critically damaging the planetary ecosystem. The Titan team members are presumably the last humans left alive.

As the surviving astronauts slowly die of disease and in-fighting, they decide to try to ensure life will continue to survive: they take a flask of bacteria and drop it into a crater filled with liquid water, in the hope that some form of life will develop.

The novel&#x27;s final sequence depicts the final two crew members returned to life through some unspecified alien process on Titan where they died, several billion years in the future. The Sun has entered its red giant phase, warming the Saturnian system and aiding the evolution of life, in the form of strange, intelligent beetle-like creatures, on Titan. The astronauts watch as the creatures build a fleet of slow Interstellar probe to seed new planetary systems before the expanding Sun boils off the surface of the moon.

==Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science==
The depiction of Titan&#x27;s surface is speculation based on respectable scientific data that was available in 1997—in fact the book &quot;Lifting Titan&#x27;s Veil&quot; notes that Baxter&#x27;s story paraphrases closely sections of papers by Lorenz on raindrops on Titan and the geomorphology of crater lakes. The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe&#x27;s study of Titan, which began in 2005, would confirm the existence of bodies of liquid on the moon.

<text>Marilyn Allene Hickey (born July 1, 1931) is an American Christian minister and televangelist who teaches Bible studies both nationally and internationally.

==Biography==
Marilyn Allene Hickey was born on July 1, 1931, in Dalhart, Texas. When she was a young girl, Hickey&#x27;s parents were professing Methodists and attended church only casually. Her family suffered from hereditary mental disorders according to one of her telecasts. Her father had it, after her grandfather and her great-grandfather that had it, even before the &quot;devil and his imps&quot; got to Marilyn, at the age of 36, she was the only one in her family not to suffer a mental disorder.

She also said that her family had a history of heart diseases, especially Hickey herself, that at age 11, she was told by her doctors she had an enlarged heart, and progressively got worse until she had surgery. She became a born again Christian when she was a teenager. In college, she studied Spanish, intending to become a public high school teacher.

She met Wallace Hickey at an Assemblies of God Church, where Wallace served as a pastor, and together on December 26, 1954, (just 1 day after Christmas), the couple were married. Around the same time, she and Wallace also met Dr. T.L. Osborn, a Pentecostal evangelist, who was 8 years Hickey&#x27;s senior. Marilyn and Wallace traveled around in their car, conducting tent revival meetings in various towns. Together, Osborn and Hickey prayed for the sick and she became a guest speaker at his conferences. Osborn was lifelong friends with her family until his death just four months after Hickey lost her husband, Wallace.

Hickey holds a Bachelor of Arts in Collective Foreign Languages from the University of Northern Colorado and an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Oral Roberts University.

Hickey has two children and four grandchildren. Hickey&#x27;s husband of 57 years, Wallace, died after a long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, in a care center in Denver, Colorado, on October 19, 2012, at age 87.

===&quot;Today with Marilyn and Sarah&quot; TV program===

Hickey has aired a television program since 1973 and, since 1996, has co-hosted it with her daughter Sarah Bowling (born February 1, 1968). &quot;Today with Marilyn and Sarah&quot; can be seen on various Christian networks such as the DayStar Network, Channel C, TCT Network, Cornerstone Television Network, and independent stations in both the U.S. and internationally, as well as through her YouTube Channel. She has also been seen on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN).

===Missionary works===

In 2012, Hickey held a three-day prayer and faith healing rally in Karachi, Pakistan which was attended by over 400,000 people. On 12 November 2016 with her 7th trip to Pakistan she aimed at reaching 1,000,000 people in a single meeting in Karachi.

Hickey has served as a member of the Board of Regents of Oral Roberts University.

<doc id="984784" wikidata="Q3312847" url="?curid=984784" title="Contrition">
<text>In Christianity, contrition or contriteness (, i.e. a breaking of something hardened) is repentance for sins one has committed. The remorseful person is said to be &quot;contrite&quot;.

A central concept in much of Christianity, contrition is regarded as the first step, through Christ, towards reconciliation with God. It consists of repentance for all one&#x27;s sins, a desire for God over sin, and faith in Christ&#x27;s redemption on the cross and its sufficiency for salvation (see regeneration and &quot;ordo salutis&quot;). It is widely referred to throughout the Bible, e.g. Ezekiel 33:11, Psalms 6:7ff, Psalm 51:1–12, Luke 13:5, Luke 18:9–13, and the well-known parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11–32).

== In the Catholic Church ==

=== Origin ===
The Council of Trent defined contrition as &quot;sorrow of soul, and a hatred of sin committed, with a firm purpose of not sinning in the future&quot;. It is also known as (affliction of spirit) and (repentance of heart).

The word &quot;contrition&quot; implies a breaking of something that has become hardened. Thomas Aquinas in his Commentary on the Master of the Sentences thus explains its peculiar use: &quot;Since it is requisite for the remission of sin that a man cast away entirely the liking for sin which implies a sort of continuity and solidity in his mind, the act which obtains forgiveness is termed by a figure of speech &#x27;contrition&#x27;.&quot; This sorrow of soul is not merely speculative sorrow for wrong done, remorse of conscience, or a resolve to amend; it is a real pain and bitterness of soul together with a hatred and horror for sin committed; and this hatred for sin leads to the resolve to sin no more. The early Christian writers in speaking of the nature of contrition sometimes insist on the feeling of sorrow, sometimes on the detestation of the wrong committed. Augustine includes both when writing: (translation: “It is not customary to say that the heart is contrite except as an incentive to repent of sins in pain.”)

Nearly all the medieval theologians hold that contrition is based principally on the detestation of sin. This detestation presupposes a knowledge of the heinousness of sin, and this knowledge begets sorrow and pain of soul. &quot;A sin is committed by the consent, so it is blotted out by the dissent of the rational will; hence contrition is essentially sorrow. But sorrow has a twofold signification—dissent of the will and the consequent feeling; the former is of the essence of contrition, the latter is its effect.&quot;

=== Necessity ===
The formal doctrine of the church, announced through the Council of Trent, declares that contrition has always been necessary to obtain pardon of one&#x27;s sins. Contrition is the first and indispensable condition for pardon. While it is possible for one to receive pardon where confession is impossible, there is no case where sin can be pardoned without contrition.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Catholic writers have always insisted that such necessity arises (a) from the very nature of repentance as well as (b) from the positive command of God. From the very nature of repentance, they point out that the sentence of Christ in Luke 13:5, is final: &quot;Except you repent&quot;, etc., and from the Church Fathers they cite passages such as the following from Cyprian, , no. 32: &quot;Do penance in full, give proof of the sorrow that comes from a grieving and lamenting soul. ... They who do away with repentance for sin, close the door to satisfaction.&quot; Scholastic doctors laid down the satisfaction principle, &quot;No one can begin a new life who does not repent him of the old&quot; (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, Pt. II, art. 1, Q. ii, also ex professo, ibid., Pt. I, art. I, Q. iii), and when asked the reason why, they point out the absolute incongruity of turning to God and clinging to sin, which is hostile to God&#x27;s law. The Council of Trent, mindful of the tradition of the ages, defined (Sess. XlV. ch. iv ) that &quot;contrition has always been necessary for obtaining forgiveness of sin&quot;. The positive command of God is also clear in the premises. John the Baptist sounded the note of preparation for the coming of the Messiah: &quot;Make straight his paths&quot;; and, as a consequence &quot;they went out to him and were baptized confessing their sins&quot;. The first preaching of Jesus is described in the words: &quot;Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot;; and the Apostles, in their first sermons to the people, warn them to &quot;do penance and be baptized for the remission of their sins&quot; (Acts 2:38). The Fathers followed up with like exhortation (Clement in P.G., I, 341; Hermas iii P.G., II, 894; Tertullian in P.L., II).

===Perfect and imperfect contrition===
In Catholic terminology, contrition arising from the love of God, who is believed to have been grievously offended, is called perfect contrition. Contrition arising from any other motive, such as loss of heaven, fear of hell, or the heinousness of guilt, is called imperfect contrition, or attrition.

==== Perfect contrition ====
Perfect contrition (also called contrition of charity) is a repentance for sin that is motivated by faith and the love of God. It contrasts with imperfect contrition, which arises from a less pure motive, such as common decency or fear of Hell. The two types of contrition are distinguished by a person&#x27;s motive for repentance, rather than the intensity of one&#x27;s feelings or emotions. Catholicism teaches that it is possible for perfect and imperfect contrition to be experienced simultaneously.

To qualify as perfect contrition, the motive must be founded on God&#x27;s own goodness, not merely his goodness to the sinner or to humanity. Catholicism holds that there is no way of knowing with an absolute certainty if one has made an act of perfect contrition, but all that is required is the standard of all human action, moral certainty. If one says an act of contrition truthfully, intending it, then one would likely have moral certainty.

Catholicism teaches that perfect contrition removes the guilt and eternal punishment due to mortal sin, even before the sinner has received absolution in the sacrament of penance, provided that the person has a firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as possible. An example of this theological precept is demonstrated in the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; in canon 916, which states: &quot;A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.&quot;

In the case of imminent death, in which sacramental confession may not be possible, an act of perfect contrition is held to remove the guilt and eternal punishment due to mortal sin.

==== Imperfect contrition ====
In contrast to perfect contrition, imperfect contrition (also known as &quot;attrition&quot;) is defined as a desire not to sin for a reason other than love of God. Catholic teaching holds that imperfect contrition does not produce justification, but does dispose the soul to receive grace in the sacrament of penance. Catholic theologians generally hold that a person who receives a sacrament while unaware of a mortal sin receives justification if they have imperfect contrition.

The Council of Trent (1545–1563) held that while imperfect contrition is motivated by reasons such as &quot;the consideration of the turpitude of sin or from the fear of Hell and punishment&quot;, it also is a gift from God. &quot;If any man assert that attrition ... is not a true and a profitable sorrow; that it does not prepare the soul for grace, but that it makes a man a hypocrite, yea, even a greater sinner, let him be Anathema.&quot;

Scriptures cited in support of imperfect contrition include: 
* Proverbs 13:13
* Proverbs 14:26–27
* Proverbs 19:23
* Matthew 10:28
* Philippians 2:12, in which Paul exhorts Christians to work out &quot;our salvation in fear and trembling&quot;. 
* Psalm 111: 10, &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&quot; 

===== Criticism of imperfect contrition =====
In his 1537 &quot;Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;, Philipp Melanchthon argued against the concept of imperfect contrition on the basis that it leaves the penitent person uncertain:
In his 1537 &quot;Smalcald Articles&quot;, Martin Luther argued against the Catholic doctrine of imperfect contrition, arguing that &quot;such contrition was certainly mere hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins; for they had to grieve, while they would rather have continued to sin, if it had been free to them.&quot; Instead he argued that &quot;repentance is not piecemeal,&quot; and &quot;In like manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or piecemeal.&quot;

=== Qualities ===
In accord with Catholic tradition, contrition, whether perfect or imperfect, must be interior, supernatural, universal, and sovereign.

==== Interior ====
Contrition must be real and sincere sorrow of heart.

==== Supernatural ====
In accordance with Catholic teaching contrition ought to be prompted by God&#x27;s grace and aroused by motives which spring from faith, as opposed to merely natural motives, such as loss of honour, fortune, and the like (Chemnitz, Exam. Concil. Trid., Pt. II, De Poenit.). In the Old Testament it is God who gives a &quot;new heart&quot; and who puts a &quot;new spirit&quot; into the children of Israel (Ezech. 36:25–29); and for a clean heart the Psalmist prays in the Miserere (Ps. 51, 11 sqq.). Peter told those to whom he preached in the first days after Pentecost that God the Father had raised up Christ &quot;to give repentance to Israel&quot; (Acts, v, 30 sq.). Paul, in advising Timothy, insists on dealing gently and kindly with those who resist the truth, &quot;if peradventure God may give them full repentance&quot; (2 Timothy, 2:24–25). In the days of the Pelagian heresy Augustine insisted on the supernaturalness of contrition, when he writes, &quot;That we turn away from God is our doing, and this is the bad will; but to turn back to God we are unable unless He arouse and help us, and this is the good will.&quot; Some of the Scholastic doctors, notably Scotus, Cajetan, and after them Suarez (De Poenit., Disp. iii, sect. vi), asked speculatively whether man if left to himself could elicit a true act of contrition, but no theologian ever taught that what makes for forgiveness of sin in the present economy of God could be inspired by merely natural motives. On the contrary, all the doctors have insisted on the absolute necessity of grace for contrition that disposes to forgiveness (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xiv, Part I, art. II, Q. iii; also dist. xvii, Part I, art. I, Q. iii; cf. Thomas, In Lib. Sent. IV). In keeping with this teaching of the Scriptures and the doctors, the Council of Trent defined; &quot;If anyone say that without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and without His aid a man can repent in the way that is necessary for obtaining the grace of justification, let him be anathema.&quot;

==== Universal ====
True contrition must extend to, at the very least, all mortal sins committed, and not just a select convenient few. This doctrine is intimately bound up with the Catholic teaching concerning grace and repentance. There is no forgiveness without sorrow of soul, and forgiveness is always accompanied by God&#x27;s grace; grace cannot coexist with sin; and, as a consequence, one sin cannot be forgiven while another remains for which there is no repentance.

The prophet Joel urged men to turn to God with their whole heart (Joel 2:12–19). and Christ tells the doctor of the law that we must love God with our whole mind, our whole strength (Luke 10:27). Ezekiel insists that a man must &quot;turn from his evil ways&quot; if he wish to live (Ezekiel 33:11).

The Scholastics inquired into this question when they asked whether or not there must be a special act of contrition for every serious sin, and whether, in order to be forgiven, one must remember at the moment all grievous transgressions. To both questions they answered in the negative, judging that an act of sorrow which implicitly included all one&#x27;s sins would be sufficient.

==== Sovereign ====
According to Mark 8:35–37, Jesus admonished his disciples: &quot;For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life?&quot; Contrition for sin must take precedence over temporal concerns. When the envoys of the Empress Eudoxia threatened John Chrysostom, he responded, &quot;Go tell the princess that Chrysostom fears only one thing, and that is sin.&quot;

=== Sacrament of Penance ===
Contrition is not only a moral virtue, but the Council of Trent defined that it is a &quot;part&quot;, and even more, quasi materia, in the Sacrament of Penance. &quot;The (quasi) matter of this sacrament consists of the acts of the penitent himself, namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction. These, inasmuch as they are by God&#x27;s institution required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament and for the full and perfect remission of sin, are for this reason called parts of penance.&quot; In consequence of this decree of Trent theologians teach that sorrow for sin must be in some sense sacramental. La Croix went so far as to say that sorrow must be aroused with a view of going to confession, but this seems to be asking too much; most theologians think with Schieler-Heuser (Theory and Practice of Confession, p. 113) that it is sufficient if the sorrow coexist in any way with the confession and is referred to it. Hence the precept of the Roman Ritual, &quot;After the confessor has heard the confession he should try by earnest exhortation to move the penitent to contrition&quot; (Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., p. 111 sqq.). For repentance is essential for the effectiveness of this sacrament, as the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; explains:
 Jesus&#x27; call to conversion and penance ... does not aim first at outward works ... but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion (1430). Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a return, a conversion to God with all our heart, an end of sin, a turning away from evil, ... the desire and resolution to change one&#x27;s life, with hope in God&#x27;s mercy and trust in the help of his grace (1431).

For Catholics, where there is mortal sin, use of the Sacrament of Reconciliation must follow.

==== Perfect contrition without the Sacrament of Penance ====

Early Church Fathers, including Clement of Rome, Hermas, and Chrysostom, held that sorrow was effective for the remission of sins. Similarly, Scholastics such as Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure taught that perfect contrition, with the desire of receiving the Sacrament of Penance, restored a sinner to grace at once. Later theologians came to emphasize the desire for the sacrament of penance over the sorrow itself, with the Council of Trent declaring that &quot;though contrition may sometimes be made perfect by charity and may reconcile men to God before the actual reception of this sacrament, still the reconciliation is not to be ascribed to the contrition apart from the desire for the sacrament which it includes.&quot;

In Catholic theology, perfect contrition is held to forgive sins due to its connection with love. Bede writes: &quot;What is love but fire; what is sin but rust? Hence it is said, many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much, as though to say, she hath burned away entirely the rust of sin, because she is inflamed with the fire of love.&quot; Accordingly, Gregory XIII condemned Baius&#x27;s proposition 32, which asserted &quot;that charity which is the fullness of the law is not always conjoined with forgiveness of sins&quot;.

Catholic theologians argue that it was possible to recover grace after sinning under the Old Covenant, citing Ezech. 33:11 (&quot;As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live.&quot;) They reason that the coming of Christ and the institution of the sacrament of penance could not have increased the difficulty of obtaining forgiveness. Therefore, equating this turning to God with perfect contrition, they conclude that the same method must still be effective.

A number of Catholic theologians have discussed what forms of love are sufficient to obtain justification. The general consensus is that pure, or disinterested love () is effective, and purely selfish love () is not. There is not a general consensus on what motives can constitute perfect love. Some theologians hold that perfect love requires loving God for his great goodness alone; others argue that the love of gratitude () suffices.

=== Obligation of eliciting the act of contrition ===
In the very nature of things the sinner must repent before being reconciled with God (Sess. XIV, ch. iv, de Contritione, Fuit quovis tempore, etc.). Therefore, whoever falls into grievous sin must either make an act of perfect contrition or supplement the imperfect contrition by receiving the Sacrament of Penance; otherwise reconciliation with God is impossible. This obligation urges under pain of sin when there is danger of death. In danger of death, therefore, if a priest be not at hand to administer the sacrament, the sinner must make an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. The obligation of perfect contrition is also urgent whensoever one has to exercise some act for which a state of grace is necessary and the Sacrament of Penance is not accessible. Theologians have questions how long a person may remain in the state of sin, without making an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. They seem agreed that such neglect must have extended over considerable time, but what constitutes a considerable time they find it hard to determine (Schieler-Hauser, op. cit., pp. 83 sqq.). Probably the rule of St. Alphonsus Liguori will aid the solution: &quot;The duty of making an act of contrition is urgent when one is obliged to make an act of love&quot; (Sabetti, &quot;Theologia Moralis: de necess. contritionis&quot;, no. 731; Ballerine, &quot;Opus Morale: de contritione&quot;).

== In other Christian theology ==
The &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot;, the primary confession of faith of the Lutheran Church, divides repentance into two parts: &quot;One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ&#x27;s sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.&quot;

Puritan preacher Thomas Hooker defined contrition as &quot;nothing else, namely, when a sinner by the sight of sin and vileness of it, and the punishment due to the same, is made sensible of sin, and is made to hate it, and hath his heart separated from the same.&quot;

Anglo-Catholic rector of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia, Alfred Garnett Mortimer, pointed out that &quot;feelings&quot; are not an adequate gauge of contrition. The signs of true contrition are a readiness to confess, a readiness to amend one&#x27;s life and avoid temptation, and a readiness to forgive others.

<doc id="984785" wikidata="Q2636589" url="?curid=984785" title="Montacute">
<text>Montacute is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, west of Yeovil. The village has a population of 831 (2011 census). The name Montacute is thought by some to derive from the Latin &quot;Mons Acutus&quot;, referring to the conically acute St Michael&#x27;s Hill dominating the village to the west. An alternative view is that it is named after Drogo de Montagu, whose family originated from Montaigu-les-Bois, in the arrondissement of Coutances. Robert, Count of Mortain held Montacute after 1066, and Drogo was a close associate of his.

The village is built almost entirely of the local hamstone. From the 15th century until the beginning of the 20th century it formed the heart of the estate of the Phelips family of Montacute House. The village has a fine medieval church, and was the site of a Cluniac priory, the gatehouse of which is now a private house.

At the centre of the village is a large square known as the &#x27;Borough&#x27; around which are grouped picturesque cottages and a pub, the &quot;Phelips Arms&quot;; there is a second public house and hotel situated in the village, called the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;.

==Nomenclature==
The village takes its name from St Michael&#x27;s Hill, the conical hill overlooking the village from the Southwest. The hill became known at some time before 1086 by the Latin name of &quot;Mons Acutus&quot;, meaning &quot;Sharp Mountain&quot;, being referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Montagud&quot;, within the manor of &quot;Biscopestone&quot; (Bishopstone): &quot;Ipse Comes (Moriton) tenet in dominio Biscopestone et ibi est castellum eius quod vocatur Montagud&quot;. (&quot;The Count of Mortain himself holds Bishopstone in demesne and there is his castle which is called Montagud&quot;). One of the Count&#x27;s tenants at &quot;Biscopestone&quot; is named in the Domesday Book as &quot;Drogo&quot;, believed to be Drogo (Drew) de Montagu, the earliest English-resident ancestor of the prominent Anglo-Norman &quot;de Montagu&quot; family (also known as &quot;Montague&quot; and &quot;Montacute&quot;), later Earls of Salisbury, which came over from Normandy with William the Conqueror. The de Montagu family held various manors in Somerset, including Shepton Montague (14 miles N-E of Montacute) and Bishopston, situated 300 metres to the south-east of the summit of the hill. Bishopston later became the site of Montacute Priory, and the village and parish of Montacute developed around it. The &quot;de Montagu&quot; family is believed to have taken its surname from its manor of origin in Normandy, now Montaigu-les-Bois, in the arrondissement of Coutances, which remained in the possession of the French branch of the family until the death of Sebastien de Montaigu in 1715, without children. According to the Duchess of Cleveland (Battle Abbey Roll, 1889): &quot;(Drogo de Montaigu) had come to England in the train of the Earl of Mortain, and received from him large grants of lands, with the custody of the castle, built either by the Earl or his son William, in the manor of Bishopston, and styled, from its position on a sharp-topped hill, Monte Acuto&quot; (sic, &quot;Mons Acutus&quot;). The French spelling &quot;Mont-Aigu&quot; means &quot;sharp mountain&quot;, and the family&#x27;s name was as &quot;de Monte Acuto&quot; (ablative form of &quot;Mons Acutus&quot; - &quot;from the Sharp Mountain&quot;). Authorities are not agreed as to whether the family was named after the hill in Bishopston, or whether the hill, village, parish and priory, were named after the family, thus ultimately after Montaigu-les-Bois in Normandy.

==History==
To the west of the village is the Iron Age hill fort of Ham Hill, a large tribal fort of the Durotriges. The fort was conquered by the Roman Legio II Augusta sometime around 45 AD. The Romans briefly occupied the fort, then moved to a more permanent garrison at nearby Ilchester (&quot;Lindinis&quot;), and constructed the Fosse Way Roman road a few miles west of the village. A Roman villa was excavated near Batemoor Barn early in the 20th century and an extensive mosaic documented. Never adequately protected, this has probably been damaged by deep ploughing and sludge injection in the last 40 years.

Originally called &quot;Logaresburgh&quot; by the Saxons, it was later known as &quot;Bishopstone&quot; (&quot;Bishop&#x27;s Town&quot;, i.e. &quot;estate belonging to the Bishop&quot;) or &quot;Biscepstone&quot; which name survives today as the street named &quot;Bishopston&quot;. The last Anglo-Saxons to own it before the Norman Conquest of 1066 were Tofig (d.1043), then successively his son Athelstan (or Æthelstan) and his grandson Asgar. Tofig was a staller (placeman or court office-holder) to Danish King Canute. Local tradition remembers Tofig as &quot;Cnut&#x27;s standard bearer&quot;. In 1030 (1035 in some records) following a series of dreams in which the Devil told him where to dig, a local blacksmith found buried on St Michael&#x27;s Hill a black flint crucifix or Holy Rood. (Some early versions state two black flint crosses were found, one large, one small. Another variant is that the second cross was wooden, and accompanied by a bell and a book/copy of the gospels.) Tofig loaded the life-sized cross (or crosses) onto a cart, and then named a series of possible destinations owned by him. The oxen pulling the wagon (six red and six white in one version of the tale) refused to move until he said Waltham in Essex, where Tofig already had a hunting lodge. They then started, and continued non-stop until they reached Waltham, and where they stopped Tofig decided to build an abbey at the site – this became Waltham Abbey. In the meantime, Tofig rebuilt the church at Waltham to house the cross, on which he bestowed his own sword, and his second wife Gytha (or Glitha), the daughter of Osgod Clapa, adorned the figure with a crown, bands of gold and precious stones.

The cross became the object of pilgrimage, notably by Harold Godwinson. It was at Tofig&#x27;s wedding at Lambeth on 8 June 1042 that King Harthacnut suddenly died of a convulsion &quot;while standing at his drink&quot;. &quot;Holy Cross&quot; became the battle-cry of Harold&#x27;s armies at the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings. The Holy Rood is said to have foretold Harold&#x27;s defeat at Hastings: on the way there from the Battle of Stamford Bridge he stopped off at Waltham Abbey to pray, and the legend is that the cross &quot;bowed down&quot; off the wall as he did so, taken as a portent of doom. There have been suggestions that the smaller cross became the &quot;Holy Rood&quot; which was carried to Scotland from Waltham Abbey by St Margaret. There has been further speculation that the site the relics were excavated from was the burial site of Joseph of Arimathea.

On Tofig&#x27;s death in circa 1043, his estates passed to his son Athelstan (or Æthelstan) and then to his grandson Asgar. Following the invasion of 1066 it was held by Robert, Count of Mortain, who built the motte-and-bailey Montacute Castle on St Michael&#x27;s Hill (the Mons Acutus) in 1068. The site of the castle was a deliberate affront to the defeated Saxons, because it was the site where Tofig had discovered the &quot;Holy Rood&quot; crucifix. Robert later founded the Cluniac priory on an adjacent site. The parish of Montacute was part of the Tintinhull Hundred.

Montacute Castle was besieged by Saxon rebels from Somerset, Dorset and neighbouring areas in 1069 and its relief required the assembly of a considerable force, drawn chiefly from the Norman garrisons of London, Winchester and Salisbury. This army was led by the Norman bishop, Geoffrey of Coutances, whose large landholdings were also threatened. The rebels were taken by surprise and bloodily defeated, putting an end to the revolt. Joseph Bettey has suggested that &quot;the devastation in the surrounding area which followed the English defeat may explain why so many manors in south Somerset are recorded in the Domesday Survey as having decreased in value&quot;. The English dead were buried in a mass grave to the west of the village in a sloping field now known as &quot;Under Warren&quot;. Village tradition has it that two hilltop fortifications were built: first a wooden clamshell fort with motte &amp; bailey, later replaced by a stone castle. However little evidence to prove the existence of either structure exists, except a note in the parish records that two loads of stone were taken from the site by the neighbouring parish of Martock. A church or chapel dedicated to St Michael later replaced the castle. Excavations of the hilltop have been limited and inconclusive.
A folly tower, built in 1760 by Edward Phelips V now occupies the hill-top. Known as St Michael&#x27;s Tower it stands on Mons Acutus which was the site of the former castle. The Hamstone tower is about in diameter, and rises before curving inwards to a viewing platform which is reached via a 52 step spiral staircase. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building and scheduled monument.
Village legends exist about the tower. One is of the supposed existence of a hidden tunnel between the tower and Montacute House. This has never been found and is more likely to be a folk memory of the remains of the Norman castle. The other is that a daughter of the Phelips family was kept locked in the tower for attempting to marry against her father&#x27;s wishes.

Considerable motte &amp; bailey earthworks are built into St Michael&#x27;s Hill, which the Somerset County Archeologist unit incorrectly suggests were wine-growing terraces. The wine terraces were actually on the north flank of the adjacent Hedgecock Hill.

There are two abandoned dwelling sites within the village, both close to Batemore Barn. One is the hamlet of Witcombe/Whitcombe, along the route of the Roman road leading from Batemore to High Wood along the Witcombe valley. The foundations of several buildings still exist there and have been excavated. Locally Witcombe is remembered as a plague village. The other dwelling site is on the north side of Batemore barn, close to the bottom of the ancient hollow-way (now filled in) known as &quot;Foister&#x27;s Gully&quot;. Little remains of this and it has not been excavated, but may have been the residence of highwayman Richard Foister/Foster/Forster, remembered locally as the last man to be gibbeted alive in England. Some of his murders were said to have taken place in the area. Also in the Witcombe valley, high up close to the boundary with the field known as &quot;Fairyland&quot; are the remains of an old lime kiln. Ham Hill stone was burnt to make soil fertiliser, the lime was of poor quality for building due to its high iron content which made mortar blow.

Fulfitt Terrace is an early 20th century council house development on the street named Townsend and is believed to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, council house schemes in Britain. Townsend itself is believed to be Roman in origin and runs into the ancient hollow-way Hollow Lane which runs to the Ham Hill plateau, forming one of the entrances through the hill fortifications.

Montacute is visited by tourists who come to the area, attracted by the nearby Ham Hill Country Park, and Montacute House (now owned by the National Trust) which is one of the finest examples of an Elizabethan house in England, and several other mansions open to the public in the immediate vicinity.

In 2009 Montacute was identified as having England&#x27;s longest life expectancy in a report compiled by Watson Wyatt Worldwide.

In November 2014 Montacute featured in the programme &#x27;Hidden Villages&#x27; presented by Penelope Keith.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The village falls within &#x27;St Michel&#x27;s&#x27; electoral ward. Although &quot;Martock&quot; is the most populous area the ward stretches to the River Yeo beyond Tintinhull in the north. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,307. It is also part of the Glastonbury and Somerton county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election.

==Geography==
An area of grass parkland lies to the east of the village; this formed the eastern approach to Montacute House though the drive through the park is now unused. Although associated with the Montacute estate, the park lies mainly within the neighbouring village of Odcombe. To the south of the village, bounded by Woodhouse Lane, and the Roman roads of Park Lane and Hollow Lane lies the older Deer Park: this is divided into High Park and Low Park by the woodland path known as Ladies Walk. The oldest extant known road in the village is a track leading from the front of the Abbey Gatehouse to Ham Hill, via the defensive ramparts of Ham Hill. This track crosses another presumed Roman Road which runs on the line of Stanchester (site of a Roman villa) - Under Warren (abandoned settlement) Batemore (Roman villa) - Witcombe (abandoned settlement) - Norton Lane — High Wood. Another ancient track struck northeast from The Borough toward Ilchester, and is revealed by the housing layout but the route across the park has been lost. This and the track to Ham Hill may possibly mark a Roman route between the fortifications of Ilchester and Ham Hill, but are probably older.

In addition to being a scheduled monument, Iron Age hill fort and Roman site, Ham Hill itself is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), local nature reserve and country park. The geology supports a wide range of fauna including mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians living on lichens, fungi, ferns and flowering plants.

===Climate===
Typical for South West England, Montacute has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the temperatures of the nearby sea. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . Winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In summer high pressure in the Azores often affects the south-west, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at nearby Yeovilton. Most of the south-west&#x27;s rainfall is caused by either Atlantic depressions or convection. Most of the autumn and winter rainfall is caused by Atlantic low pressure systems, their period most frequent activity. In summer, a significant proportion of the rainfall is caused by convection, where the sun warms the ground causing showers or thunderstorms. Average summer rainfall is . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. The highest mean wind speeds occur from November to March, whilst June to August sees the lowest. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.
==Religious sites==

The Church of St Catherine has 12th century origins, and is a Grade II* listed building. The church was altered in the 13th and 15th centuries and was extensively restored in 1870 by Henry Hall. The church contains monuments to the Phelips family including David and Ann, who died in 1484, and Bridget, who died 1508. There are canopied effigies of Thomas, died 1588, and Elizabeth, died 1598. On the west wall is a marble monument to Edward, who died in 1690. An Anglo-Saxon Hamstone font lay unidentified in the churchyard for many years, but has now been reinstated replacing its Tudor successor.

Little now remains of the Cluniac Montacute Priory, which fell during the Reformation, except the inaccurately named &quot;Abbey Gatehouse&quot; (a private dwelling) and its attached stew pond and pigeon cote. The former infirmary for the Priory — the Grade II thatched &quot;Monk&#x27;s House&quot; dating from the 15th century — is also a private dwelling.
The actual location of the priory is uncertain: the uneven ground in the field behind the church may be the site, however during the 1975-76 drought cropmarks clearly showed the previous existence of a demolished large building in the field named &quot;Upper Meads&quot; adjacent to Hollow Lane.

A chapel was built on St Michaels Hill, sharing the dedication to St Michael, following the demolition of the castle. Nothing now remains. Hill dedications to St Michael are common in the west country (e.g. Glastonbury Tor, St Michael&#x27;s Mount) and may indicate a pre-Christian religious origin.

==Notable residents==
The dissolved Priory of Montacute was obtained from King Henry VIII by the poet Thomas Wyatt in 1542 and after his death was passed in 1544 by his son, Thomas Wyatt the Younger, to Elizabeth Darrell, the poet&#x27;s mistress, and their young son Francis, and they soon took up residence there.

Thomas Shoel (1759-1823), the self-taught poet and composer of sacred music, lived in the village.

The vicar of Montacute between 1885 and 1918 was the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), father of the writers John Cowper Powys, Llewelyn Powys and Theodore Francis Powys. Philippa Powys, their sister and another author, was born in Montacute. Llewelyn Powys, in his &quot;Somerset Essays&quot;, devoted a chapter to Thomas Shoel (1759-1823), a native of the village who wrote poetry and composed music including many hymn tunes, some of them still well known In John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel first &quot;Wood and Stone&quot; (1915) the fictional village of Nevilton is based on Montacute.

<doc id="984786" wikidata="Q6859199" url="?curid=984786" title="Miller Park, Preston">
<text>Miller Park is a public park under the management of Preston City Council. It is located on the banks of the River Ribble in Preston, Lancashire, in the north west of England. The park is one of two city centre Victorian era parks, the other being the adjacent and larger Avenham Park.

==History==
The park was designed and built in the 1860s and has matured over the last 140 years into one of the most attractive parks in the region. As an English Heritage Grade II* listed park, it features a number of historical structures including a sundial, a grotto and a fountain. There is also an impressive statue of the 14th Earl of Derby who was British prime minister from 1866 to 1868. The two parks are separated by the East Lancashire Railway embankment and access is through the Ivy Bridge and along Riverside Walk. The East Lancashire Railway line closed in the 1970s although the viaduct across the river, which is a Grade II listed building, remains, as it carries a public footpath across the river. The west edge of the park is bounded by the embankment carrying Preston&#x27;s main rail link, the West Coast Main Line.

The park was designed by Edward Milner as a &#x27;Harmonious Whole&#x27; including the adjacent Avenham Park. This park is more formal than its neighbour and includes beautiful bedding displays, a Rose Garden and the regal Derby Walk, all of which are maintained by Preston City Council&#x27;s Horticultural Services. It is overlooked by the Park Hotel, a Victorian former hotel used as offices by Lancashire County Council until 2016. A modern extension to the council offices, which also overlooked the park, was demolished in 2020 as part of works to convert the building back into a hotel.

Apart from this office block, the appearance of the park has hardly changed since it was first laid out; the only other modern construction, a brick toilet block, was demolished in March 2006. A map published in 1889 still provides an accurate representation of the park&#x27;s layout.

==The inauguration of the park==

Preston&#x27;s Avenham Park, Moor Park and Miller Park were inaugurated on the same day that the former Town Hall was opened in 1867. On 28 September 1867 the Preston Chronicle commented that the preparations were in place and that the expectation was that &quot;…….we shall have a gayer, a busier, and a more bustling town than we have had on any previous occasion, excepting, perhaps, at some of our Guilds&quot;. The following week&#x27;s edition for 5 October 1887 devoted several columns to &quot;The Opening of the New Town Hall and Inauguration of the Parks&quot;. It was a civic event of considerable size and importance and when the opening ceremony for the town hall was concluded a procession was formed which made its way to Avenham and Miler Parks. Schoolchildren from across Preston had gathered in the parks and it was estimated that 23,000 to 25,000 were present. The Duke of Cambridge, cousin to Queen Victoria, was in attendance and the band of the Third Royal Lancashire Militia entertained the crowds.

== Proposed developments ==
As part of a multimillion-pound Heritage Lottery Funded restoration project, both Avenham and Miller Park will see a facelift over the next few years. The refurbishment will include restoration of all of the historical features (including The Fountain, Derby Walk etc.), improved lighting and footpaths, vehicle controls and the new Pavilion in Avenham Park which has a cafe, new public toilets and incorporates a police post as well as being a base for dedicated Parks staff. The old stage, which was removed in early 2006, has been replaced by a small performance area and the facilities to install temporary concert stages like those used at music festivals throughout the country. These improvements help the park become cleaner, safer and provide more events and activities for the people of Preston.

<text>The read-through, table-read, or table work is a stage of film, television, radio, and theatre production when an organized reading of the screenplay or script is conducted around a table by the actors with speaking parts.

In addition to the cast members with speaking parts, the read-through is usually attended by the principal financiers or studio executives, producers, heads of department, writers, and directors. It is generally attended only by people involved in the production. It is usually the first time that everyone involved in the production gathers together, and it is traditional for all people to introduce themselves by both name and job. The director may then open proceedings by making a short speech outlining their aspirations for the project.

An additional professional actor not otherwise involved in the production may be hired to read the non-dialogue parts of the script such as scene headings and action. These parts of the script are usually edited down severely for the purposes of the read-through to maintain the pace of the reading.

==In film==
The read-through is an important milestone in the production of most films. It is a clear signal that all of the key elements, including cast, finance, and heads of department, are in place and that pre-production is almost complete. It is often the first time that the script has had a life beyond the written word, and it is also an opportunity for everyone involved in production to get at least a partial insight into the way the actors may approach their roles.

In addition, a read-through is often a powerful tool for identifying problem areas in the script. Wooden dialogue, unbelievable situations, or boring sections of the film that have not been addressed during the script development process often become apparent during the read-through.

<doc id="984789" wikidata="Q941184" url="?curid=984789" title="Word of Faith">
<text>Word of Faith is a movement within charismatic Christianity which teaches that Christians can get power and financial prosperity through prayer, and that those who believe in Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection have the right to physical health. 

The movement was founded by the American Kenneth Hagin in the 1960s, and has its roots in the teachings of E. W. Kenyon. 

Word of Faith is rejected as unbiblical and heretical by almost all Christian scholars and theologians across nearly every denomination. N. T. Wright, an Anglican bishop and theologian, referred to it as “myth” and a “pact with the Devil.”

==History==
The Baptist minister E. W. Kenyon (1867–1948) is generally cited as the originator of Word of Faith&#x27;s teachings. Kenyon&#x27;s writings influenced Kenneth Hagin Sr., the recognized &quot;father&quot; of the Word of Faith movement. Hagin, who had founded a ministry known as the Kenneth E Hagin Evangelistic Association, started disseminating his views in the &quot;Word of Faith&quot; magazine in 1966, and subsequently founded a seminary training Word of Faith ministers.

==Teachings==
Distinctive Word of Faith teachings include physical, emotional, financial, relational, and spiritual healing for those who keep their covenant with God. The movement urges believers to speak what they desire, in agreement with the promises and provisions of the Bible, as an affirmation of God&#x27;s plans and purposes. They believe this is what Jesus meant when he said in Mark 11:22–24 that believers shall have whatsoever they say and pray with faith. The term &quot;word of faith&quot; itself is derived from Romans 10:8 which speaks of &quot;the word of faith that we preach&quot;.

===Healing===
The Word of Faith teaches that complete healing (of spirit, soul, and body) is included in Christ&#x27;s atonement and therefore is available immediately to all who believe. Frequently cited is Isaiah 53:5, (&quot;by his stripes we are healed&quot;), and Matthew 8:17, which says Jesus healed the sick so that &quot;it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet, &#x27;Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses&#x27;.&quot;

Because Isaiah speaks in the present tense (&quot;we healed&quot;), Word of Faith teaches that believers should accept the reality of a healing that is already theirs, first by understanding that physical healing is part of the New Testament&#x27;s promise of salvation. It is reinforced by confessing the Bible verses which assert this healing and believing them while rejecting doubt. This does not deny pain, sickness, or disease, but denies its right to supersede the gift of salvation in Isaiah 53:5 and many other passages. According to adherents, sickness is generally Satan&#x27;s attempt to rob believers of their divine right to total health.

===Prosperity===

Word of Faith teaching holds that its believers have a divine right to prosper in all areas of life, including finances, health, marriage, and relationships. Prosperity is not desired for the hoarding of finances but to be an avenue God uses to fund missions for the spreading of the gospel and to help the needy.

Word of Faith preachers such as Creflo Dollar and Kenneth Copeland claim that Jesus was rich, and teach that modern believers are entitled to financial wealth.

===Faith and confession===
In Word of Faith teaching, a central element of receiving from God is &quot;confession&quot;, often called &quot;positive confession&quot; or &quot;faith confession&quot; by practitioners. Practitioners will claim and affirm they have healing, well being, prosperity, or other promises from God, before actually experiencing such results. They do so in demonstration of their faith, which they believe will ultimately result in the fulfillment of their words. While similar, it should not be confused with Norman Vincent Peale&#x27;s positive thinking theology focusing on the individual, as evidenced by the motto, &quot;Faith in God and believe in oneself&quot;. Noted Word of Faith teachers, such as Kenneth E. Hagin and Charles Capps, have argued that God created the universe by speaking it into existence (Genesis 1), and that God has endowed believers with this power. Thus, making a &quot;positive confession&quot; of God&#x27;s promise and believing God&#x27;s word stirs the power of resurrection which raised Christ from the dead (Ephesians 1:19–20, 3:20), and brings that promise to fulfilment. This teaching is interpreted from Mark 11:22–23. A more recent variant of positive confession is &quot;decree and declare&quot;. Word of Faith preachers have called faith a &quot;force&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;negative confession&quot; is believed to be harmful, and so it is taught that believers should be conscious of their words. This is argued on the interpretation of Proverbs 18:21, &quot;Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and they that love them will eat the fruit thereof&quot;, and also Numbers 14:28, &quot;...saith the Lord, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do&quot;, among other scriptures.

==Criticism==
Many of the movement&#x27;s essential beliefs are criticised by other Christians. Christian author Robert M. Bowman, Jr. states that the word of faith movement is &quot;neither soundly orthodox nor thoroughly heretical&quot;.

One of the earliest critics of Word of Faith teaching was Oral Roberts University professor Charles Farah, who published &quot;From the Pinnacle of the Temple&quot; in 1979. In the book, Farah expressed his disillusionment with the teachings, which he argued were more about than faith.

In 1982, one of Farah&#x27;s students, Daniel Ray McConnell, submitted a thesis, &quot;Kenyon Connection&quot;, to the faculty at Oral Roberts University, tracing the teaching back through Hagin to Kenyon and ultimately to New Thought, and calling the distinctive Word of Faith beliefs a heretical &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; in the Christian church. McConnell repeated this argument in his book, &quot;A Different Gospel&quot;, in 1988.

One of McConnell&#x27;s classmates, Dale H. Simmons, published his own doctoral research at Drew University, arguing that Kenyon was influenced by heterodox metaphysical movements and the Faith Cure movement of the nineteenth century. In 1990, &quot;The Agony of Deceit&quot; surveyed the critiques of Word of Faith doctrines. One of the authors, Christian Research Institute founder Walter Martin, issued his personal judgment that Kenneth Copeland was a false prophet and that the movement as a whole was heretical.

Milder criticisms were made by William DeArteaga in his book &quot;Quenching the Spirit&quot;. He concedes some New Thought influence in Kenyon&#x27;s teaching, but argues that Kenyon&#x27;s views helped the church rediscover some biblical truths. Arguing similarly but in an opposite direction is Robert M. Bowman, Jr., formerly of the Christian Research Institute. His book &quot;The Word-Faith Controversy&quot; is more sympathetic to Kenyon&#x27;s historical background yet more critical of his doctrine than DeArteaga&#x27;s work.

Evangelist Justin Peters, an outspoken critic of the Word of Faith movement, wrote his Master of Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has appeared frequently as an expert on Word of Faith pastors in documentaries and TV news stories. In his seminar &quot;Clouds Without Water&quot;, he traces the movement&#x27;s origins to the Phineas Quimby&#x27;s New Thought and E. W. Kenyon&#x27;s Positive Confession in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In contrast, Pastor Joe McIntyre, now head of Kenyon&#x27;s Gospel Publishing Society in Washington, argues that the primary influences of Kenyon were A.B. Simpson and A.J. Gordon of the Faith Cure branch of the Evangelical movement. McIntyre&#x27;s version is told in the authorized biography, &quot;E. W. Kenyon: The True Story&quot;. The same year, Pentecostal scholar Gordon Fee wrote a series of articles denouncing what he called &quot;The Disease of the Health-and-Wealth Gospel&quot;.

In 1993, Hank Hanegraaff&#x27;s &quot;Christianity in Crisis&quot; charged the Word of Faith movement with heresy and accused many of its churches of being &quot;cults.&quot; He accused the Word of Faith teachers of &quot;demoting&quot; God and Jesus, and &quot;deifying&quot; man and Satan. Hanegraaff has focused a significant portion of his anti-heresy teaching since the 1990s on addressing and refuting Word of Faith teachings.

Other critics, such as Norman Geisler, Dave Hunt and Roger Oakland, have denounced Word of Faith theology as aberrant and contrary to the teachings of the Bible. 

John Macarthur of Grace Community Church accused Benny Hinn, Marilyn Hickey, Joyce Meyer, Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, Robert Tilton, Oral Roberts, Paul Crouch and others of preying on the &quot;weak and the desperate&quot; through the &quot;blasphemous lie&quot; of the Word Faith Movement. He said, &quot;You have been exposed to this lie, this deception, this pagan pantheistic perspective that has been turned into a spiritual Ponzi scheme, making the people at the top of the food chain rich, preying on the desires, the material worldly desires, of the people who want all this stuff. Comes under the name the Word Faith movement, prosperity gospel, name-it-and-claim-it.&quot;

===&#x27;Little gods&#x27; belief===
Many Word of Faith teachers use phrases such as &quot;little gods&quot; to describe believers. Kenneth Hagin wrote that God had created humans &quot;in the same class of being that he is himself,&quot; and reasoned that if humans are made in God&#x27;s image, they are &quot;in God&#x27;s class&quot;, and thereby &#x27;gods&#x27;.

Many Evangelical critics have condemned the &quot;little gods&quot; teaching as cultic. Hank Hanegraaff, for example, contends the &#x27;little gods&#x27; doctrine is on a par with the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Jim Jones.

<doc id="984793" wikidata="Q1069121" url="?curid=984793" title="Fourth ventricle">
<text>The fourth ventricle is one of the four connected fluid-filled cavities within the human brain. These cavities, known collectively as the ventricular system, consist of the left and right lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The fourth ventricle extends from the cerebral aqueduct (&quot;aqueduct of Sylvius&quot;) to the obex, and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The fourth ventricle has a characteristic diamond shape in cross-sections of the human brain. It is located within the pons or in the upper part of the medulla oblongata. CSF entering the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct can exit to the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord through two lateral apertures and a single, midline median aperture.

==Boundaries==

The fourth ventricle has a roof at its &quot;upper&quot; (posterior) surface and a floor at its &quot;lower&quot; (anterior) surface, and side walls formed by the cerebellar peduncles (nerve bundles joining the structure on the posterior side of the ventricle to the structures on the anterior side). The caudal tip of the fourth ventricle - where it becomes the central canal - is known as the obex; the obex is also a marker for the level of the foramen magnum of the skull and therefore is a marker for the imaginary dividing line between the medulla and spinal cord.

The superior portion of the &quot;roof&quot; (i.e. of the posterior edge) is formed, in the midline, by a thin lamina called the superior medullary velum, and laterally by the cerebellar peduncles. The inferior portion of the &quot;roof&quot; is formed superiorly by the inferior medullary veli and the vermis of the Cerebellum (covered with choroid plexus), and inferiorly by the tela. The inferior portion of the &quot;roof&quot; is where CSF can escape the ventricle through three openings: Near each of the three corners of the inferior roof there is an opening into the cisterna magna, the caudal opening being the &quot;foramen Magendie&quot;, while the lateral openings are the &quot;foramina of Luschka&quot;. Therefore, the fourth ventricle is the connector between the ventricular system (where CSF is produced) and the subarachnoid space (where CSF is absorbed). The &quot;roof&quot; rises (i.e. posteriorly) to a peak, known as the fastigium (Latin for &quot;summit&quot;); the fastigial nucleus lies immediately above the roof of the fourth ventricle, in the cerebellum.

The &quot;floor&quot; (i.e. the anterior edge) of the fourth ventricle constitutes the rhomboid fossa, and comprises a number of general features. A sulcus - the median sulcus - extends the length of the ventricle (from the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain to the central canal of the spinal cord), dividing the floor into right and left halves. Each half is further divided by a further sulcus - the sulcus limitans - along a line parallel to the median sulcus; within the floor, motor neurons are located medially of the sulcus limitans, while sensory neurons are located laterally. The elevation between the median sulcus and sulcus limitans (i.e. the region for motor neurons), is known as the &quot;medial eminence&quot;, while the lateral region (i.e. that for the sensory neurons) is known as the &quot;vestibular area&quot;. The sulcus limitans bifurcates at either end - the &quot;superior fovea&quot; cerebrally, and the &quot;inferior fovea&quot; caudally.

The pons is located behind the middle and superior portion of the &quot;floor&quot;. In the superior region of the pons is the locus coeruleus, which due to its concentration of noradrenaline has a sky blue appearance, visible (in a colour closer to teal) through the floor of the ventricle, superiorly to the superior fovea. The internal part of the facial nerve bulges into the ventricle, forming the facial colliculus, in the process of looping around the abducens nucleus within the inferior region of the Pons.

The medulla oblongata is located behind the inferior portion of the &quot;floor&quot; (and continues caudally of the ventricle). Medullary striae emerge via the median sulcus and run transversely across the floor to become part of the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The hypoglossal nucleus bulges into the &quot;floor&quot;, creating the hypoglossal trigone, located slightly superiorly to the inferior fovea, within the median eminence. The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve, within the medulla oblongata, comprises cells that are spindle shaped, also creating a bulge—the vagal trigone—in the region of the &quot;floor&quot; which overlies them; this is the region inferior of the inferior fovea.

== Development ==
The ventricular system including the fourth ventricle, develops from the central canal of the neural tube. Specifically, the fourth ventricle originates from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing rhombencephalon. During the first trimester of pregnancy the central canal expands into the lateral, third and fourth ventricles, connected by thinner channels. Choroid plexuses appear in the ventricles which produce cerebrospinal fluid. If the flow of fluid is blocked ventricles may become enlarged and cause hydrocephalus.

==Clinical significance==
The floor of the fourth ventricle is a common location of an intracranial ependymoma in children.

<doc id="984796" wikidata="Q1363141" url="?curid=984796" title="Grigor Parlichev">
<text>Grigor Stavrev Parlichev (; ; 18 January 1830 – 25 January 1893), also known as Grigorios Stavridis (), was a Bulgarian writer, teacher and translator. He received acclaim as a &quot;second Homer&quot; in Greece for his poem &quot;O Armatolos&quot;. Afterward, he became a Bulgarian national activist. Other notable of his works include the poems Skenderbeg, 1762 leto and his autobiographical work &quot;Autobiography&quot;. In North Macedonia and Bulgaria, he is regarded as a pioneer of national awakening, but his national identity has been also disputed between both countries.

== Life ==

Grigor Parlichev was born on 18 January 1830 in Ohrid, Ottoman Empire (present-day North Macedonia), as the fourth child of Maria Gyokova and Stavre Parlichev, a craftsman. He was six months old when his father died. His paternal grandfather, who was a farmer, took over the care of the family. He was taught to read Greek by his grandfather. Parlichev studied in a Greek school in Ohrid. He was taught by Dimitar Miladinov, a Bulgarian National Revival activist. In 1839 or 1840, his grandfather died. His family lived in poverty. Parlichev&#x27;s mother worked as a house servant, while he also contributed to the living of his family by selling goods at the market and copying Greek handwritings. In 1848–1849, he was a teacher in a Greek school in Tirana, probably in Greek. There he experienced homesickness. He went to Athens to study medicine in 1849 but due to lacking money, he returned to Ohrid in the next year. In the 1850s, he worked as a teacher in Dolna Belica, Bitola, Prilep and Ohrid. In this period, he was seen as a &quot;Grecoman&quot; by his contemporaries. In 1858 Parlichev returned to Athens to study medicine in the second year but later transferred to the Faculty of Linguistics. Adopting the Hellenized form of his name - Grigorios Stavridis, in 1860, he took part in the annual poetry competition in Athens, winning first prize for his poem &quot;O Armatolos&quot; (), written in Greek. Acclaimed as &quot;second Homer&quot; and given a bursary to study abroad, he gave part of it to a poor student and spent the rest of it. Fellow contestant Theodoros Orphanidis accused him of being a Bulgarian and associated him with Bulgarian propaganda. In 1862, he also wrote another poem called &quot;Skenderbeg&quot; () in Greek, with which he participated in the poetry competition, but it was not awarded. After the death of his teacher Dimitar Miladinov in the same year, he returned to Ohrid.

Upon his return, he became familiar with the Bulgarian language and the Cyrillic script. Parlichev continued to teach Greek for a living. He encouraged the Bulgarians of Ohrid to send a petition to the Ottoman sultan for the restoration of the Archbishopric of Ohrid in May 1867. In May 1868, he went to Istanbul (Constantinople) to study the Church Slavonic language. After studying, he returned to Ohrid in November. In the same year, he advocated for the use of Bulgarian in the schools and churches. He also replaced Greek with Bulgarian in the Ohrid school where he was a teacher. Parlichev was arrested and spent several months in an Ottoman jail in Debar after a complaint was sent by the Greek bishop of Ohrid Meletius due to his activities.

He married Anastasiya Hristova Uzunova in 1869 and had five children: Konstantinka, Luisa, Kiril, Despina and Georgi. In the 1870s, Marko Balabanov and the other editors of the magazine &quot;Chitalishte&quot; (Reading room) in Istanbul made him the suggestion to translate Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; into Bulgarian. In 1870 Parlichev translated his award-winning poem &quot;O Armatolos&quot; into Bulgarian in an attempt to popularize his earlier works, which were written in Greek, among the Bulgarian audience. Parlichev was the first Bulgarian translator of &quot;Iliad&quot; in 1871. However, he was criticized by Bulgarian literary critics because they considered his knowledge of Bulgarian as poor. Parlichev used a specific mixture of Church Slavonic, Bulgarian, Russian and his native Ohrid dialect. In 1872, he published the poem called 1762 leto. He worked as a teacher in Gabrovo in 1879–1880 but he was not satisfied with the climate and the dialect there. In 1883 Parlichev moved to Thessaloniki where he taught at the Thessaloniki Bulgarian Male High School from 1883 to 1889. During his stay there he wrote his autobiography between 1884 and 1885. After his retirement in 1890, he returned to Ohrid, where he lived with a pension until his death on 25 January 1893.

=== Identification and views ===
Per historian Raymond Detrez, who received his PhD for his thesis on Parlichev, in his early life Parlichev was a member of the Romaic community, a multi-ethnic proto-nation, comprising all Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire. It had been under way until the 1830s, with the rise of nationalism in the Balkans. In his youth, he had no well-defined sense of national identity and developed a Greek (Rum Millet) identity (in the sense of being an Orthodox Christian), but as an adult, he adopted a Greek and later a Bulgarian national identity. In the last decade of his life, he adhered to a form of vague local Macedonian patriotism, though continued to identify himself as a Bulgarian. Thus, in the context of discussions about the existence of the Macedonian nation, his national identity became disputed between Bulgarian and Macedonian (literary) historians. However, he never identified himself as an ethnic Macedonian. As a Bulgarian national activist, he used German historian Jakob Fallmerayer&#x27;s discontinuity thesis against the Greeks. In his autobiography, he wrote that the Bulgarians had been scorned and abused enough by other peoples and advised them to become aware of themselves, instead of despising themselves, to become confident of their abilities and rely on their hard work to achieve progress. In 1889, under a translation, he signed himself as &quot;Gr. S. Părličev, killed by the Bulgarians&quot;
(Гр. С. Пърличевъ, убитий българами).

=== Language ===
As a child, Parlichev learned to write excellent Greek and later wrote in his autobiography that he mastered literary Greek better than a native speaker. However, as an adult, despite his Bulgarian self-identification, Parlichev had poor knowledge of literary Bulgarian, which appeared to him as a &quot;foreign language&quot;. He started learning to read and write in Bulgarian only after his return from Athens in 1862. In his autobiography, Parlichev wrote: &quot;I was, and I am still weak with the Bulgarian language,&quot; and &quot;In Greek I sang like a swan, now in Slavic I cannot even sing like a donkey.&quot; His native Ohrid dialect was different from the eastern Bulgarian dialects. He used a mix of Church Slavonic, Russian and Bulgarian words and forms, as well as elements from his dialect, which is known as &quot;common Slavic&quot;. Because of this, he was criticized for his translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Thus, according to Bulgarian historian Roumen Daskalov, Parlichev reacted against his Bulgarian literary critics by withdrawing into &quot;an alternative Macedonian regional identity, a kind of Macedonian particularism.&quot; However, when he came to write his autobiography, Parlichev used the standard Bulgarian language with some influence of his native Ohrid dialect.

=== Legacy ===
His autobiography was published posthumously in Sofia in a Bulgarian periodical called &quot;Folklore and Ethnography Collection&quot;, produced by the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, in 1894. Parlichev&#x27;s son Kiril Parlichev became a prominent member of the revolutionary movement in Macedonia and a Bulgarian public figure. After World War II, Macedonian historians started regarding him as an ethnic Macedonian author. Both North Macedonia and Bulgaria regard him as a pioneer of national awakening. The Parlichev Ridge in Antarctica is named after him. A digital monument honoring him was set up in the center of Ohrid in 2022.

<text>Paul Francis Jennings (20 June 1918 – 26 December 1989) was an English humourist and author. After his Catholic education, Jennings served in World War II. For many years he wrote a column, &quot;Oddly Enough,&quot; in British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;. Many collections of his work were published, including &quot;The Jenguin Pennings&quot; (whose title is a spoonerism) by Penguin Books in 1963. He also wrote popular children&#x27;s books including &quot;The Great Jelly of London&quot;, &quot;The Hopping Basket&quot;, and &quot;The Train to Yesterday&quot;.

Jennings married Celia Blom in 1951. He died in 1989.

==Early life and education==
Paul Francis Jennings was born on 20 June 1918 in Leamington Spa. His parents were William Benedict and Gertrude Mary Jennings. He was educated at King Henry VIII school in Coventry and at the Douai Catholic school in Woolhampton, Berkshire.

==Career==

Jennings served in the Royal Signals during the Second World War. In 1943 his piece &quot;Moses was a Sanitary Officer&quot; was published in &quot;Lilliput&quot; magazine. Freelance work for &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; soon followed. Leaving the army with the rank of Lieutenant, he briefly worked as a scriptwriter for the Central Office of Information and then spent two years as an advertising copywriter; throughout this period his freelance work continued to be published.

In 1949 he joined &quot;The Observer&quot;, contributing a fortnightly column entitled &quot;Oddly Enough&quot; until 1966, when he was succeeded by Michael Frayn, who was an admirer of his work. After leaving &quot;The Observer&quot;, he continued to write until his death, mainly seeing print in &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Telegraph magazine.&quot;

==Style==

His columns constitute several hundred 700-word essays. In general his pieces take the form of whimsical ponderings; some are based in real-life incidents, often involving his friend Harblow.
For instance, one of his pieces, &quot;How to Spiel Halma&quot;, concerns their attempts to establish the rules of halma from the instructions in a German set using their extremely limited knowledge of the language.
His pieces are sometimes poems, and sometimes written in novel forms of language, such as the Romance-eschewing Anglish, or that of a toy 19-letter &quot;pipewipen&quot; (typewriter). Other articles were extended flights of fancy, such as &quot;The Unthinkable Carrier&quot; based on the idea of cutting Britain free of the Earth&#x27;s crust so that it could float around the oceans and guarantee world peace, with the Isle of Wight kept in place by a tow chain. In a late 1950s piece, &quot;Sleep for Sale&quot;, he prefigured the concept of the capsule hotel (&quot;Over to you, capitalists. But remember, I thought of it first.&quot;). Several of his pieces touched on the invented philosophical movement of Resistentialism, a concept that probably owes some of its force to the contempt that Jennings—a devout Catholic—felt for the intellectual fashion he was parodying.

Jennings was an admirer of James Thurber, who attended a dinner party at Jennings&#x27;s house and subsequently wrote of the conversation in a 1955 &quot;New Yorker&quot; piece.

In later years he was an active member of the church choir at St Thomas of Canterbury church in Woodbridge. Jennings died on 26 December 1989.

<text>The Kennedy School, originally the John D. Kennedy Elementary School, is a former elementary school that has been converted to a hotel, movie theater and dining establishment in northeast Portland, Oregon. The facility is operated by the McMenamins chain. The hotel has 35 guestrooms, a brewery, four bars, and a restaurant.

==History==
The school was built in 1915. The land for the school was sold by John Daniel Kennedy to the Portland School District in 1913.

==Currently==
By the 1990s, the school had been abandoned. McMenamins, the Portland-based hotel and pub group, bought the old building and funded a full renovation. Today, the Kennedy School functions as an event space with 57 classroom-turned-guestrooms with original chalkboards included. The old cafeteria has been converted into a courtyard restaurant, and the common areas now include a bar, gift shop, movie theater, brewery, and soaking tub.

Kennedy School won in the &quot;Best Date Bar&quot; category of &quot;Willamette Week&quot; &quot;Best of Portland Readers&#x27; Poll 2020&quot;.

<text>Pruneface is a fictional character in the long-running comic strip &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, drawn by cartoonist Chester Gould. He is one of the series&#x27; main villains and notable for his wrinkly face despite being a young man.

==Fictional character biography==
Pruneface&#x27;s surname is Boche, a typically Dickensian-style naming of a character by Gould, since &quot;Boche&quot; is a French derogatory term for &quot;German&quot;. He is a brilliant industrial engineer with a horribly deformed face. He sells out to the Nazis and is involved in espionage against the United States, as well as the development of nerve gas.

Pruneface first appeared (and apparently died) in 1942, having nearly frozen to death due to exposure during a shootout with the police. The character was revived in 1983. The 1983 story explains that he had been used in an early cryogenics experiment by Dr. Kryos Freezdrei and is reanimated using modern medicine. Freezdrei uses Pruneface&#x27;s revival as a publicity stunt, however, to advertise the services of his cryogenics institute to the wealthy and gullible, whom the doctor and Pruneface plan to bilk for millions which would go towards funding neo-Nazi groups. This storyline ends with the bombing of the institute, Freezdrei&#x27;s apparent death and Pruneface&#x27;s disappearance, all at the hands of a Mossad agent. A cryogenics tube containing the frozen body of Adolf Hitler can be seen in the background as a fire destroys both him and the institute.

A later story arc explains, mostly through an extended flashback, that prior to his first meeting with Tracy, Pruneface led an espionage ring for the Axis powers to acquire a new secret formula for the deadly Xylon bomb, a non-radioactive explosive capable of devastating 10 city blocks. Xylon was developed by Professor Roloc Bard, a mad scientist who was taken hostage by a fake swami named Yogee Yammi during an earlier storyline of the 1940s. The ring consisted of Pruneface (hidden from the readers, going by Boche until halfway through the storyline) and his wife, Mrs. Pruneface, Shaky Trembly, Flattop Jones and his gang, and Frieda Smith (the professor&#x27;s love interest and a secret Bundist). Pruneface kidnaps Bard and forces him to build several of the bombs, all of which but one is seized by Tracy and FBI agent Jim Trailer, hence the reason for the story being &quot;suppressed&quot; during the actual war. Returning to the present, de-classified documents on the Xylon case show that the case was still unsolved and that one final bomb was still out there, as potent and deadly as ever. This leads Tracy, Wendy Wichel and FBI Agent Jim Trailer to finding the last bomb hidden 10 blocks away from the Oval Office in an elderly Frieda Smith&#x27;s basement. Right after she is arrested by Tracy and Jim Trailer, the bomb is defused. Her empty house soon after receives a telephone call from Pruneface to set the bomb off, causing him and Dr. Freezdrei to change their plans and go back into hiding.

Pruneface and Freezdrei would resurface and terrorized Dick Tracy&#x27;s hometown with a product-tampering scheme that rendered Tracy&#x27;s wife Tess blind;
along with large portions of the town. Nazi sympathizers working in supermarket warehouses co-operated in poisoning instant coffee ;which was sold widely. Freezdrei had invented the concoction, and only he knew the antidote. A masked man named &quot;Captain Cure&quot; would break into local TV programming
and demand huge ransom money to prevent further outbreaks.

Tracy and the FBI traced the broadcasts to an underground hideout, where Freezdrei was crushed underneath heavy machinery. Pruneface was tricked into
thinking he had been dosed with the deadly formula and he revealed the antidote.

Pruneface made one final reappearance in 1999, being held in a Mossad prison. He was the target of a liberation attempt by his granddaughter Prunella and great-granddaughter Prune Hilda, but the plan failed at the last second, and Pruneface was sent plunging to his death from a mountain gondola. His final words were &quot;Sieg Heil&quot;.

==In other media==
Pruneface is a featured villain in &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot;, a syndicated animated children&#x27;s program which aired in the 1960s. He is voiced by either Mel Blanc or Paul Frees, and his vocal characterization is modeled after that of Boris Karloff. His complexion is lavender, lending him the color and wrinkled look of an actual prune. He is nearly always partnered with Itchy Oliver.

As &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot; was produced by UPA, which also produced the original Mr. Magoo cartoons, Pruneface appeared as the primary villain in an episode of &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;. In this Tracy/Magoo crossover episode entitled, &quot;Dick Tracy and the Mob&quot;, Pruneface is depicted as the chairman of a mob organization, the other board members consisting of fellow Tracy villains Flattop, Ichy Oliver, the Brow, Mumbles, the Mole, and Oodles.

The character also makes a brief appearance in the 1990 film adaptation of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, in which he is portrayed by R. G. Armstrong. In this adaptation, he is an American mobster, operating in Tracy&#x27;s city, who accepts Big Boy Caprice as his superior. He is eventually gunned down by the Blank.

In Kyle Baker&#x27;s graphic novels that served as prequels to the movie, Pruneface&#x27;s real name is given as Lorenzo Prunesti.

In the 1943 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon short &quot;Porky Pig&#x27;s Feat&quot; by Frank Tashlin, Daffy Duck confronts the manager of the Broken Arms Hotel, pretending to be intimidated by something he said. Daffy moves closer to his face so intensely that it is pushed inward, making it resemble a prune. Daffy, noticing this, says to the audience, &quot;Hey, look! A Dick Tracy character: Pruneface!&quot; Another &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short, 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot; by Bob Clampett, has Daffy (as &quot;Duck Twacy&quot;) encountering a pack of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;-style villains, including an obvious Pruneface parody called &quot;Pickle Puss&quot;.

Pruneface appears in Jason Yungbluth&#x27;s 2002 graphic novel &quot;Weapon Brown&quot;, which re-imagines many syndicated comic strip characters in a post-apocalyptic setting, as a member of the Syndicate, a group of crime lords and scientists ruling over a post-apocalyptic America. The group also consists of &quot;Chairman Horns&quot; (the Pointy-Haired Boss from &quot;Dilbert&quot;), Mary Worth, Uncle Duke from &quot;Doonsbury&quot;, and (until Horns brutally kills him) Mr. Dithers from &quot;Blondie&quot;.

Pruneface, alongside the Brow, is one of the antagonists in &quot;Dick Tracy Forever&quot;.

<text>Avenham Park is a Grade II* listed public park in Avenham, close to the centre of Preston in Lancashire in the northwest of England, and managed by Preston City Council.

The park is located in Preston&#x27;s Conservation area and leads down to the banks of the River Ribble. It was designed and built in the 1860s.

==Overview==
As an Historic England Grade II* listed public park, which features a number of historical structures such as The Belvedere, the Swiss Chalet, the Boer War Memorial and Riverside Walk. The park is one of two city centre Victorian parks in Preston, the other being its neighbour - Miller Park. The two parks are separated by the East Lancashire Railway embankment and access is through the Ivy Bridge and along Riverside Walk. The East Lancashire Railway line closed in the 1970s although the viaduct across the river, which is a Grade II listed building, remains.

The park was designed by Edward Milner as a &quot;harmonious whole&quot; including the adjacent Miller Park. The park includes long open lawn areas and hosts a number of annual events throughout the year. Most notable among its many features is the Japanese garden or Rock Garden, which was added in the 1930s when this type of design became fashionable.
Another major feature of the park is The Belvedere, a pavilion on high ground at the northeastern corner of the park, overlooking the main park and river. It was originally located in Miller Park but was moved to make way for the statue of the Earl of Derby. The Belvedere is known locally as the &quot;&quot;White House&quot; or the &quot;Light House&quot;&quot;.
A path on the northern edge of the park follows the route of the Old Tram Road, which used to link the northern and southern parts of the Lancaster Canal. The path descends an incline to the River Ribble. On the site of the current Belvedere was once a stationary steam engine that hauled waggons up the hill. The path crosses the river on a concrete footbridge built in the 1960s on the site of the original tramway trestle bridge. The modern bridge has been built in the same style as the original wooden structure.

The field in the centre of the park has a gentle slope towards the river, and acts as a natural amphitheatre. The original Victorian Bandstand was demolished and replaced with a brick and concrete stage during the 1950s to enable the area to be used for concerts. This construction had surprisingly good acoustic qualities but fell into disuse and was demolished in March 2006, although the Park is still used for many local and regional annual events. These include Preston&#x27;s Mela, which celebrates the culture of the city&#x27;s large Asian community and on Easter Monday children have traditionally rolled decorated eggs down its grassy slopes since Victorian times. Bands and musicians such as Oasis, The Spice Girls, Natasha Bedingfield, Sushi, Mark Owen, and Labyrinth have also performed in Avenham Park in more recent years.

In general, the layout of the park is little changed from when the park was first laid out. An 1889 map Wayback Machine still provides an accurate representation of the park today.

==The inauguration of the park==

Preston&#x27;s Avenham Park, Moor Park and Miller Park were inaugurated on the same day that the former Preston Town Hall was opened, in 1867. On 28 September 1867 &quot;The Preston Chronicle&quot; commented that the preparations were in place and that the expectation was that &quot;... we shall have a gayer, a busier, and a more bustling town than we have had on any previous occasion, excepting, perhaps, at some of our Guilds&quot;. The following week&#x27;s edition, for 5 October 1867, devoted several columns to &quot;The Opening of the New Town Hall and Inauguration of the Parks&quot;. It was a civic event of considerable size and importance and when the opening ceremony for the Town Hall was concluded, a procession was formed which made its way to Avenham and Miller Parks. Schoolchildren from across Preston had gathered in the parks and it was estimated that between 23,000 and 25,000 were present. The Duke of Cambridge, cousin of Queen Victoria, was in attendance and the band of the Third Royal Lancashire Militia entertained the crowds.

==Recent developments==
As part of a multi-million pound Heritage Lottery-funded restoration project, both Avenham and Miller Parks have undergone a facelift over the last few years. The refurbishment, which is nearing completion, included restoration of all of the historical features (including The Belvedere, The Boer War Memorial etc.), improved lighting and footpaths, vehicle controls and a new Pavilion incorporating a café, public toilets and a police post and acting as a base for dedicated park staff. The old stage, which was removed in early 2006, was replaced by a small performance area and facilities to install temporary concert stages like those used at music festivals throughout the country.

An architectural design competition was launched by RIBA Competitions and McChesney Architects were chosen by Preston City Council, at a cost of £2 million. In September 2008 the new Pavilion, together with its cafe, was opened. New lamps were installed and the Japanese Garden was restored. As part of the refurbishment, the path along the railway embankment and the viaduct was widened and given a hard surface. The Council intends to open this path onto the Fishergate Centre car park, to allow direct pedestrian and cycle access from the railway.

In April 2015 an unexploded military mortar bomb was discovered by metal detectorists near the park. An area close to the Old Tram Bridge was cordoned off. In February 2019, the tram bridge was closed when an inspection revealed cracks putting the bridge at risk of collapse. In March 2024 a new suspension-type design was revealed for a replacement bridge and in April work began on a £6.6m project to replace the old tram bridge. It is hoped the new bridge, funded by Levelling Up cash and LCC, will open in 2025.

<text>Zakariya Essabar (; 3 April 1977) was a Moroccan college student of al-Qaeda and an associate of the organizers of the September 11 attacks.

He was born in Morocco on 3 April 1977 and immigrated to Germany in 1997. In 1998, he studied medical technology at Hamburg University of Technology. Through the Muslim religious community there he met Ramzi bin al-Shibh and other members of the Hamburg cell. Essabar quickly became more religious while in Germany. He lived for some time at the Hamburg cell apartment.

After being radicalized in 1999, Essabar trained in Afghanistan where he learned combat skills and passport alteration. Ramzi bin al-Shibh later said that Essabar delivered the cryptic message from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, indicating the date that the September 11 attacks would be carried out, although bin al-Shibh&#x27;s claim is in doubt. Essabar may not have known the significance of the date, but he did relay the message. The truth of bin al-Shibh&#x27;s claims is in doubt, due to &quot;inconsistent statements&quot;. Despite a German arrest warrant issued a month after the attacks, Essabar was not captured and, according to al-Qaeda, was later killed in Afghanistan.

<doc id="984812" wikidata="Q1028559" url="?curid=984812" title="Murasaki no Ue">
<text>Murasaki no Ue (紫の上), also spelled &quot;Murasaki-no-Ue&quot;, is the main heroine of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. She is also known as &quot;Lady Murasaki&quot; in some translations. She first appears in the fifth chapter, when she is a young girl. Prince Genji first encounters her in a village in Kitayama and becomes enamored with her, especially after learning that she is the niece of his stepmother, Lady Fujitsubo, whom he is enamored with and carries on an affair with. When Murasaki&#x27;s father refuses to give him permission to adopt her, and dismisses his proposals as unserious, Genji decides to abduct Murasaki no Ue and raise her at his palace, where he grooms her into becoming similar to Fujitsubo, who embodies the feminine standards that he desires. Murasaki&#x27;s relationship with Genji remains consistent through the novel, even when her heart is broken on multiple occasions when Genji participates in affairs with other women.

Like most characters in &quot;Genji&quot;, Murasaki no Ue is never given a name. This stems from Heian-era manners, which deems referring to people by their personal names as rude. The true name of the author, Murasaki Shikibu, has never been discovered as a result of this convention. The author was named after Murasaki&#x27;s sobriquet, and the name &quot;Shikibu&quot; comes from the title &quot;Shikibu-shō&quot;, a title for a person who had a position in the Ministry of Ceremonial Affairs. The author would have had a male relative who held a position as a Shikibu-sho, and, because it was common to refer to women as the titles that their male relatives had, thus it would have become the name she would be commonly referred to.

==Name==

Murasaki no Ue&#x27;s name remains a pseudonym, as due to court manners of the author&#x27;s time (the Heian period, 794–1185), it was considered unacceptably familiar and vulgar to freely address people by either their personal or family names; within the novel, the character herself, too, is unnamed, as most of the book&#x27;s characters are never identified by any name, but by their rank and title (in the case of male persons), the rank and title of their male relatives (in the case of female persons), or after the name of their habitation (in the case of the great court ladies). As such, the &quot;Genji&quot; character Murasaki is often referred to as the &quot;Lady of the West Wing&quot;. In most commentaries and translations, she is simply referred to as &quot;Murasaki&quot; for ease of identification and to improve readability.

== A Word Game, or, a Famous Color in Literature ==
The name Murasaki is inspired by a poem that the novel&#x27;s hero, Genji, improvises when contemplating his first meeting with the novel&#x27;s heroine, then a little girl who will grow up to be &quot;Murasaki&quot;:

 is the Japanese word for the color purple. Other translations include lavender, as used by Edward Seidensticker in his English version of &quot;Genji&quot;; violet; and violet root, which in Japanese poetry denotes love and constancy.

Genji, in his poem, names the or purple gromwell, because its color resembles the color of wisteria (in Japanese, ) thereby obliquely referring to Fujitsubo, &quot;the Lady of the Wisteria Court&quot;, a woman he is violently in love with for the first part of the novel. This lady Fujitsubo is little Murasaki&#x27;s aunt. Thus, in a word association game very characteristic of Japanese poetry, the similarity between the two colors – the deep purple of the violet, and the light purple of wisteria – led to the name Murasaki, a well-known name in Japanese literature.

(It is a further twist to this word game, that the novel&#x27;s Murasaki, the Lady of the West Wing, though certainly turning into a shining example of love and constancy, ends her life in pious resignation, with a jealous demon appearing at her bedside - thereby destroying Genji (the hero).)

<doc id="984822" wikidata="Q4160173" url="?curid=984822" title="Paul Jennings (Australian author)">
<text>Paul Jennings AM (born 30 April 1943), is an English-born Australian writer for children, young adults and adults. He is best known for his short stories that lead the reader through an unusual series of events and end with a twist. Many of his stories were adapted for the cult classic children&#x27;s television series &quot;Round the Twist&quot;. Jennings collaborated with Morris Gleitzman on the book series &quot;Wicked!&quot;, which was adapted into an animated TV series in 2000, and &quot;Deadly!&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Paul Jennings was born on 30 April 1943 in Heston, Middlesex (now part of Hounslow in London). In 1949 his family emigrated to Australia. 

He first attended Bentleigh West Primary School in Bentleigh, a suburb of Melbourne, and then Caulfield Grammar School.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Education Studies from Frankston Teachers&#x27; College and taught at Frankston State School, Kangaroo Flat State School, the Turana Youth Training Centre and the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital State School in Mount Eliza. He then went to the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences (now part of Monash).

==Career==
After graduating, he worked as a speech pathologist then lecturer in special education at the Burwood State College and later, in 1979, Senior Lecturer in Language and Literature at Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education (both now part of Deakin University).

In 1985, Jennings&#x27;s first book of short stories, &quot;Unreal!&quot;, was published, during which he worked as a teacher, lecturer and speech therapist. He began writing for children when his son, aged 11, was having trouble reading.

Jennings&#x27;s short stories were adapted for the first two seasons of children&#x27;s television series &quot;Round the Twist&quot; in 1989 and 1992, and then later in 1998 for the only season of series &quot;Driven Crazy&quot;.

In 2020 Jennings&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Untwisted: The Story of My Life&quot;, was published by Allen &amp; Unwin. Jennings started writing it ten years earlier, and it is his longest piece of writing. In it, he examines many aspects of his life, including harbouring feelings of guilt about disliking his cold and emotionally abusive father, and having thoughts of attacking him.

==Personal life==
Jennings first married aged 22. He has six children, and is a great-grandfather. His third wife is comedian Mary-Anne Fahey. He has two step-children and two adopted children, who have helped to inform some of his stories about children looking for their biological parents. He currently resides in Warrnambool, Victoria.

==Awards and honours==
*In 1992, Jennings received a Gold Puffin Award, for selling one million books in Australia.
*In 1993 he won an Angus &amp; Robertson Bookworld Award, as Australian Author – Children&#x27;s Literary Medal Criteria, &quot;Best Selling Author&quot; and &quot;Most Valued Author&quot;.
*In 1993 Jennings was made Victorian of the Year – Western Region, presented by the Australia Day (Victoria) Committee, for services to the Victorian community.
* In 1995 he was appointed Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AM), in the Australia Day 1995 Honours List, for service to children&#x27;s literature.

<text>The British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) is an association for social and recreational rugby league. It works jointly with the Rugby Football League through the RFL Community Board.

==History==

BARLA was created on 3 March 1973 at the George Hotel in Huddersfield by a group of clubs believing that the Rugby Football League were not doing enough to support the amateur game. The RFL voted 29–1 against the recognition of BARLA, with Tom Mitchell being the only one to vote in favour. A subsequent vote twelve months later following a change in the RFL board, resulted in a unanimous vote of approval for BARLA. 

One of BARLA&#x27;s first acts was to merge the vast majority of the district leagues into five regional leagues: the Yorkshire League (initially still called the Leeds &amp; District League), the short-lived Cumbria League, the West Yorkshire Sunday League, the Pennine League, and the North Western Counties League. For geographical reasons, the Hull &amp; District League (renamed Humberside League) and the Southern League were left unmerged. This allowed clubs to play at more appropriate standards as there were more divisions, and this factor along with the improved governance of BARLA saw the standard and numbers of clubs rise quickly.

The Yorkshire County Cup and Lancashire County Cup knock-out competitions were started in 1973 as well as the BARLA National Cup.

In 1977 BARLA toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time. In that year the BARLA Young Lions made their first inaugural tour setting a lasting trend by giving future stars of the game such as David Hobbs their first taste of international rugby league.

A Cumbria County Cup was started in 1982.

The BARLA National League was introduced for the 1986–87 season. The inaugural season featured 10 teams.

The association has always been a champion of the amateur ethos and in 1987 BARLA played a major role in the establishment of the &#x27;free gangway&#x27; between the two codes at an amateur level. The agreement allowed players to inter-change between rugby league and rugby union without fear of discrimination.

The BARLA National League soon proved popular and the 1989–90 season also saw the addition of a second division.

On 30 November 1990, BARLA&#x27;s new headquarters at West Yorkshire House, Huddersfield was opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1993, BARLA provided the first Great Britain team to tour South Africa. The BARLA National League was rebranded as the National Conference League and expanded to three divisions (now named premier, first, and second) in 1993.

By 1999, there were more than 1,400 teams and 900 youth and junior teams. On an average weekend in the season, almost 23,000 players will be in action.

BARLA&#x27;s work in the international expansion of the game was recognised by their inclusion as affiliate members of the International Federation (equivalent to the International Board at the time) in 1999 and by BARLA&#x27;s inclusion in the Emerging Nations World Championship in 2000.

BARLA won the Emerging Nations World Championship beating Italy 20–14 in the final.

In 2004, BARLA realigned itself with the RFL following pressure from Sport England regarding funding.

==Competitions==
===Leagues===
BARLA has run amateur leagues in the heartlands since its foundation in 1973. The non-heartlands amateur competition was set up by the Rugby League Conference in 1997. BARLA competitions are as follows:

*Tier 4: National Conference League
*Tier 5: Cumberland A.R.L (as Cumbria Rugby League), and City &amp; County of Kingston Upon Hull &amp; District A.R.L. (as City of Hull and District League)

<doc id="984827" wikidata="Q2081154" url="?curid=984827" title="Martock">
<text>Martock is a large village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It is situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels, north-west of Yeovil in the South Somerset district. The parish includes Hurst, approximately one mile south of the village, and Bower Hinton, which is located to the west; the village is bounded by Hurst and the A303. Martock has a population of 4,766 and was historically a market town.

==History==

===Etymology===
Martock was known in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Mertoch&quot;. It means &#x27;Rising bright from the shining sea&#x27; from the Old English &#x27;meretorht&#x27;. It was the property of Queen Edith (Eagdith), wife of Godwin and mother of Earl Harold (Harold II). By 1066 it was the property of Queen Edith, wife of Edward the Confessor. The word root &#x27;Mer-’ can also refer to &#x27;a boundary or shore line&#x27; from the Old English &#x27;maere&#x27;. It is possible that the name included the Old English element &#x27;stoc&#x27; meaning &#x27;by a lake&#x27;.

An alternative theory to the origin of the name Martock comes from the Old English words &quot;mart&quot; meaning market and &quot;ac&quot; for oak. This might relate to an oak tree on the spot now occupied by the Market House or more precisely the column there. Ekwall suggested that the name derives from &#x27;merkestoc&#x27; meaning &#x27;a place on a boundary&#x27;. However, Prebendary G.W. Saunders, vicar of Martock from 1917 to 1951, cites two more possibilities. Firstly, from Collinson, who wrote in 1790, that the name Martock is derived from &#x27;market oak&#x27;. But unfortunately Martock was not granted a market until 1247 and long before that it was called by this name. His second suggestion is that the name is derived from a Celtic personal name &#x27;Merti&#x27;, who gave his name to a settlement, hence Merti-oc, the settlement of Merti. Both of these seem to be flights of fancy.

Bower Hinton was called &#x27;Hanton Mertoc&#x27; in 1225 and &#x27;Burhenton&#x27; in 1280. &#x27;Hinton&#x27; meaning a poor enclosure, from the Old English &#x27;hean&#x27; and &#x27;tun&#x27;.

Newton means the new enclosure from the Old English &#x27;niwe&#x27; and &#x27;tun&#x27;. The medieval hamlet of Newton, which lay between Bower Hinton and Hurst, was first referred to in 1327. Stapleton was first recorded in 1195. It means the steep enclosure from the Old English &#x27;steap&#x27; and &#x27;tun&#x27;. Alternatively it may be from the Old English &#x27;stapel&#x27; and &#x27;tun&#x27;, meaning &#x27;settlement by a post&#x27;.

===Domesday book===
Martock had a single entry in the Domesday book and expanded rapidly in the succeeding years to include dependent settlements at Bower Hinton, Hurst, Newton, Coat, Stapleton, Ash, Witcombe, Milton and Long Load, expanding between 1086 and 1302 from 89 tenants to more than 200. It was the only parish in the Martock Hundred.

===Later history===
In 1810, 1,025 acres of common land were enclosed as a result of the Inclosure Acts.

The village was once a junction on local branches of the Great Western Railway, now dismantled.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications; it works with the local police, district council officers and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

An electoral ward exists in the same name. Although &quot;Martock&quot; is the most populous area the ward stretches north to Long Load. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 5,724.

It is also part of the Glastonbury and Somerton county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one member of parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Economy==
Local businesses include arts and crafts (stonemasonry, woodworking, silversmithing) a reclamation yard, and a fish and chip shop. Historically a market town, these days a monthly farmers market is held in Martock.

==Landmarks==

The Treasurer&#x27;s House is a National Trust-owned property, built from hamstone during the 13th century.

Notable dwelling houses include Church Lodge. Local places of interest include the Burrow Hill Cider Farm.

The Parrett Iron Works was a series of industrial buildings next to the River Parrett. The site was originally named Carey&#x27;s Mill and the adjoining bridge is called Carey&#x27;s Mill Bridge, which was built of hamstone in the 18th century. The Iron Works was founded in 1855, on the site of a former snuff mill. The site included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keepers cottage still exist.

The hamstone Market House on Church Street was completed about 1785. It is a Grade II listed building. A grant of £190,000 was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund to restore the building and establish a community office on the ground floor in 2008. In front of the Market House is a Market Cross, also known as The Pinnacle, with a column which dates from 1741 with a fluted Tuscan order column, on a stepped plinth, which supports a ball finial crowned with a wrought iron weathervane.

Madey Mill is a Grade II* listed watermill with medieval origins. The current buildings date from the 17th century. It has suffered from a lack of maintenance and has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register.
==Religious sites==
The Church of All Saints dates from the 13th century. It was acquired by the Treasurer of Wells Cathedral in 1227 and he became the rector and patron of the church. The church was restored by Benjamin Ferrey, who was architect to the Diocese of Bath and Wells from 1841 until his death, and also in 1883–84 by Ewan Christian. The tower was built in four stages, to replace the previous one over the central crossing. It has offset corner buttresses to the full height of the tower. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. It is said to be the second largest in Somerset and has unique carved wooden statues in the eaves.

==Transport==
South West Coaches operates the 52 bus route, which connects the village with Yeovil and Bower Hinton. There are also four routes to serve local school and college students.

Martock railway station was a stop on the Yeovil-Taunton line between 1853 and 1964; the station building has since been demolished but the Railway Hotel remains extant as a public house.

The B3165 bisects the village from north to south; it connects the A372 with the A303.

<text>Creech St Michael is a village and civil parish in Somerset, three miles east of Taunton. The parish straddles the M5 motorway and includes several scattered settlements. The village of Creech St Michael and the hamlets of Charlton, Creech Heathfield, and Ham lie east of the motorway. The hamlets of Adsborough, Coombe, Langaller, and Walford lie west of the motorway. The parish has a population of 2,416.

==History==

The name derives from the Celtic &quot;crug&quot;, &quot;hill&quot;(although local residents think it means &quot;creek&quot;, because the area is relatively flat), and the parish church of St. Michael, which dates from the 13th century.

Creech St Michael was part of the hundred of Andersfield.
Charlton House is a Grade II listed manor house, formerly in the ownership of the Acland and Coombe families.

The Bridgwater &amp; Taunton Canal provides a picturesque route through the village for pleasure boats, and the towpath is open to pedestrians and cyclists. There are also dramatic remains of the Chard Canal, including the (filled) junction with the Bridgwater &amp; Taunton Canal, a raised embankment leading south from the village, a ruined aqueduct that would have carried the canal over the River Tone, and the abutments of a second aqueduct across a local road.

The Bristol and Exeter Railway line was opened through the village in 1842 and the junction of the Chard Branch Line was located here in 1860, but Creech St Michael railway station was not opened until 13 August 1928. The station was actually north of the junction so was only used by trains to Yeovil and Bristol. It closed on 5 October 1964 but the line is still open, forming a part of the London to Penzance main line. The branch is closed but remains of it are visible. including the skeleton of a five-arched bridge across the River Tone, and an embankment curving south, parallel to the abandoned canal.

A large paper mill was built on the river to the west of the village in 1875, finally closing in 1993.

In the Second World War, a line of fortifications was built on the boundary of the village, as part of the Taunton Stop Line. The line was meant to contain any German invasion of the south west peninsula. Several pillboxes remain along the Bridgwater &amp; Taunton Canal, one at the old junction with the Chard canal, and one on the embankment of the Chard railway.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton (formed on 1 April 2019) and, before this, the district of Taunton Deane (established under the Local Government Act 1972). From 1894-1974, for local government purposes, Creech St Michael was part of Taunton Rural District. 

It is also part of the Taunton and Wellington county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

<text>Sugar Babies is a musical revue conceived by Ralph G. Allen and Harry Rigby, with music by Jimmy McHugh, lyrics by Dorothy Fields and Al Dubin and various others. The show is a tribute to the old burlesque era. (The show&#x27;s name is taken from one of many shows on the old Mutual Burlesque wheel of the Roaring Twenties.) First produced in 1979 on Broadway and running nearly three years, the revue attracted warm notices and was given subsequent touring productions.

==Productions==

&quot;Sugar Babies&quot; opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on October 8, 1979 and closed on August 28, 1982 after 1,208 performances. Staging and choreography was by Ernest Flatt, with sketches directed by Rudy Tronto, musical direction by Glen Roven, scenic and costume design by Raoul Pene Du Bois, lighting design by Gilbert Vaughn Hemsley Jr., vocal arrangements and lyrics by Arthur Malvin, additional vocal arrangements by Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane, and orchestrations by Dick Hyman.

The revue starred Mickey Rooney in his Broadway debut, Ann Miller, and featured Ann Jillian, Peter Leeds and Jerry Orbach. After the original stars left, successors included Juliet Prowse, Anita Morris, Joey Bishop, Eddie Bracken, Jeff Dunham and Rip Taylor.Maxie Furman

The revue subsequently had a short-lived National tour which starred Carol Channing and Robert Morse, from August through November 1980. The 1982 Bus and Truck Tour starred Eddie Bracken and Jaye P. Morgan (who was succeeded by Mimi Hines). The 2nd National Tour, in 1984 and 1985, reunited Rooney and Miller.

A revival of the show, &quot;Sugar Babies 2&quot;, which would have starred Jerry Lewis, Chita Rivera and Rip Taylor, was planned for the fall of 1991, but ultimately did not happen. 

==Concept==

Norman Abbott, nephew of famed straight man Bud Abbott, inherited his uncle&#x27;s &quot;treasure trove of burlesque material, including written gags, props, music, and posters.&quot; Inspired, the younger Abbott and his wife had an idea:

Norman and his wife conceived of a modern Broadway musical combining all the elements of burlesque. He then came to the conclusion that the only person alive who could pull this off as a headliner was Mickey Rooney. - Richard Lertzman and William J. Birnes, in &quot;The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney&quot;

After two weeks of rehearsals, however, Rooney clashed with Abbott, who was directing the show. Rooney, who insisted on taking a hand in staging the comedy scenes himself, told Abbott, &quot;This isn&#x27;t going to work out.&quot; Abbott was fired as director, and although he didn&#x27;t have a contract, he sued producer Harry Rigby and received a six-figure settlement. 

(Ralph G. Allen) visited theaters around the country, sitting with elderly comics and taking down their routines. He amassed a collection of some 5,000 comedy sketches. He considered writing a book, but Dr. Allen realized it would be much more fun to put on a show. He wrote a revue, based on the sketches, which was performed at the University of Tennessee. Some time later, Dr. Allen gave a talk in New York at a conference on early-20th-century popular entertainment. As part of his lecture, he read the script of his revue. Afterward, he was approached by a member of the audience, Mr. Rigby, a producer.

In 1977, at a &quot;scholarly four‐day conference to study the &quot;History of American Popular Entertainment&quot;&quot; at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Ralph G. Allen, a theater professor and historian fascinated with burlesque, presented a lecture, from a prior &quot;College of Fellows of the American Theatre&quot; Address, with pieces of a revue he wrote, that borrowed material from long-forgotten burlesque routines, &quot;At My Mother&#x27;s Knee (and Other Low Joints)&quot;. Rigby was in the audience and approached Allen about the material, and together they wrote the book for the show. &quot;Sugar Babies&quot; debuted two years later.

The show consists of old burlesque blackout gags and sketches, interspersed with song and dance numbers, and vaudeville specialty acts. Typical of the risqué jokes was this one in the &quot;Broken Arms Hotel&quot; sketch:

DESK CLERK (on the telephone): &quot;Broken Arms Hotel... What&#x27;s that? You say you got a leak in the bathtub?... Well, go ahead! You paid for the room!&quot;

The &quot;Sugar Babies&quot; score contains standards such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; and &quot;I Feel a Song Comin&#x27; On&quot;, and newly created musical numbers, including &quot;The Sugar Baby Bounce&quot;.

The show had burlesque &quot;tropes&quot; such as the swing number, the sister act, the fan dance, the vaudeville dog act. &quot;It was all fast and funny and it ended with a patriotic number...with the entire company in red, white, and blue with a flag background and Miller as the Statue of Liberty.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Time&quot; wrote that the show is a &quot;happy send-off to burlesque&quot;, and &quot;Rarely has so much energy been packed into so small a package. Rooney dances, he sings, he mugs, he dresses in drag.&quot;

<doc id="984842" wikidata="Q1476098" url="?curid=984842" title="Bridal Chorus">
<text>The &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; () from the 1850 opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot; by German composer Richard Wagner, who also wrote the libretto, is a march played for the bride&#x27;s entrance at many formal weddings throughout the Western world. In English-speaking countries, it is generally known as &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot; or &quot;Wedding March&quot;, but &quot;wedding march&quot; refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot;. Wagner’s piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858.

The chorus is sung in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to her bridal chamber.
==Text==
Although at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without singing, in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three.


Eight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody.

The chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage.

== Religious attitudes ==

Some Christian churches disagree with the use of the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; at wedding ceremonies. In an FAQ on the website of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod it was explained that opposition to the piece dated from before the First World War, when Lutherans were opposed &quot;to any sort of theater&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s operas were seen as &quot;depict[ing] pagan stories and themes.&quot; A pamphlet issued in 2003 by the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said that the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; was &quot;not to be used&quot;, again because it is a theatrical piece, but also because it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and because its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.

Many Jewish couples prefer to choose other music due to the antisemitic views espoused by Wagner and his stated lack of respect for Jewish music.

<text>The Centre for Life is a science village in Newcastle upon Tyne where scientists, clinicians, educationalists and business people work to promote the advancement of the life sciences. The centre is a registered charity, governed by a board of trustees, which receives no public funding.

==History==
The centre was opened by the Queen in May 2000. In March 2009 the centre was the main venue for the UK&#x27;s first Maker Faire, run as part of the Newcastle ScienceFest. The 2010 Newcastle Maker Faire was held at the Centre for Life and the nearby Discovery Museum. Maker Faire UK returned to the Centre for Life in 2013, at which over 300 hackers, crafters, coders, DIYers and inventors presented their projects alongside installations and drop-in workshops, and also in 2016.

==Life Science Centre==

The Life Science Centre is a visitor attraction at the International Centre for Life. It has a changing programme of events made up of temporary and permanent exhibitions, a Science Theatre, a planetarium.

==Exhibitions and activities==
The centre provides employment for some 600 people. Partners in the Centre for Life include the NHS and Newcastle University. The Experiment Zone allows visitors to try out laboratory-style experiments such as DNA extraction and the Brain Zone explores how the human brain works. The Wow Zone features several hands on activities, including a &#x27;Big Machine&#x27; where guests can catapult plastic pellets up to a height of 6 metres, and a set of seats connected to pulley systems: requiring guests to pull on a wire to send them up a height.

Life Science Centre has hosted major touring exhibitions such as Body Worlds Vital in 2014. In the winter months, Times Square is host to an open-air ice rink.

== Medical research ==
Newcastle Fertility Centre was established in 1991 at the RVI, later moving to the Centre for Life and officially opened by Professor Lord Robert Winston on 22 February 2000. As well as treating infertile couples, it carries out research and development into new fertility treatments.

Scientists based at The Centre for Life were the first people in Europe - and only the second in the world - to get a license for stem cell research on human embryos. The license will allow work on new treatments for conditions including diabetes, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2005 scientists based at the centre were the first to successfully clone a human embryo.

The NHS Northern Genetics Service is part of the Institute of Genetic Medicine. The main purpose of the Northern Genetics Service is to provide comprehensive and fully integrated clinical and laboratory services to the highest of standards that can help reduce the incidence of illnesses associated with genetic disease.

<doc id="984851" wikidata="Q3290222" url="?curid=984851" title="Wayne Grudem">
<text>Wayne A. Grudem (born 1948) is an American New Testament scholar, theologian, seminary professor, and author. He is a professor of theology and biblical studies at Phoenix Seminary in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Grudem was born on February 11, 1948, in Jim Falls, Wisconsin. As a child, he attended First Baptist Church in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He holds a B.A. in economics from Harvard University, an M.Div. and D.D. from Westminster Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D. in New Testament studies from the University of Cambridge.

=== Career ===
In 2001, Grudem became Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary. Prior to that, he had taught for 20 years at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, where he was chairman of the department of biblical and systematic theology.

Grudem served on the committee overseeing the English Standard Version translation of the Bible, and from 2005 to 2008 he served as general editor for the 2.1-million-word &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; (which was named &quot;2009 Christian Book of the Year&quot; by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association). In 1999 he was the president of the Evangelical Theological Society. Grudem announced having been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease on December 22, 2015.

On July 28, 2016, Grudem published an opinion piece on &quot;Townhall&quot; called &quot;Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice&quot;. On October 9, the piece was retracted and replaced with one entitled &quot;Trump&#x27;s Moral Character and the Election&quot;. On October 19, the original piece was reinstated and another piece was published, entitled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Like Either Candidate, Then Vote for Trump&#x27;s Policies&quot;. Grudem endorsed Trump for re-election in 2020.

In 2018, a &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published in his honor. &quot;Scripture and the People of God: Essays in Honor of Wayne Grudem&quot; included contributions from John M. Frame, R. Kent Hughes, Ray Ortlund, John Piper, Vern Poythress, Leland Ryken, Thomas R. Schreiner, and Bruce A. Ware.

==Theology==
He is the author of multiple books, including &quot;Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine&quot;, which advocates a Calvinistic soteriology, the inspiration and inerrancy of the Bible, believer’s baptism, a plural-elder form of church government, Old Earth creationism, and the complementarian view of gender relationships. &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; is a highly influential theology textbook that has sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Grudem holds to noncessationist beliefs and was at one time a qualified supporter of the Vineyard Movement.

Grudem and Bruce A. Ware were at the center of Trinitarian debate in 2016 that began online and culminated in print publications. Both Grudem and Ware subscribe to a view of the Trinity called &quot;eternal relations of submission and authority&quot; or &quot;eternal functional subordination&quot; which claims that the Son is eternally submissive to the Father. Their view was challenged by some scholars that the Son only submits to the Father in the incarnation according to his human nature.

Grudem is also a co-founder and past president of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. He also edited &quot;Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood&quot;, &quot;Christianity Today&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Year&quot; in 1992, with John Piper.

In 1985, Grudem authored a study of over 2000 , arguing that none of the metaphoric uses carry the meaning of &#x27;source&#x27;, as recent authors had argued.

All of Grudem&#x27;s research on gender-related issues is now contained in his major 2012 reference work, &quot;Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: An Analysis of More Than One Hundred Disputed Questions&quot;.

<text>Walter Smith Gurnee (March 9, 1813 – April 17, 1903) served as Mayor of Chicago (1851–53) for the Democratic Party. The Village of Gurnee, Illinois is named for him.

==Biography==
Gurnee was born in Haverstraw, New York and arrived in Chicago in 1836 after spending time in Michigan. Once in Chicago, he established a tannery, which, by 1844, employed between thirty and fifty men. He was a founding member of the Chicago Board of Trade. Prior to becoming the mayor of Chicago, Gurnee was the primary partner of Gurnee &amp; Matteson, a saddlery and leather firm. Gurnee did well enough in this business, and in his tannery, that he amassed a large fortune before moving to New York City.

Gurnee campaigned for the mayoralty on the issue of public ownership of the city&#x27;s water supply. Once in office, he fought against the merger of the Illinois Central and Michigan Central railroads, originally planned to meet up south of the city. He was elected to two terms, winning the mayoralty in 1851 and being reelected in 1852.

Gurnee unsuccessfully attempted to stage a return to the mayor&#x27;s office in the 1860 mayoral election. He lost to &quot;Long John&quot; Wentworth, who had previously served a term as mayor as a Democrat, but had switched to the Republican Party.

The village of Gurnee, Illinois was named for him.

<text>Isaac Lawrence Milliken (August 29, 1813December 2, 1889) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois from 1854 to 1855. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Saco, Massachusetts (now in Maine), Milliken moved to Chicago in 1837 and set up a blacksmith shop on Randolph Street. Here, Milliken taught himself law and was twice elected alderman and appointed an assistant county judge.

In the election of 1854, Milliken defeated Amos Gaylord Throop, who ran on the Temperance Party ticket, with nearly 60% of the vote. Although Throop was the temperance candidate, after winning the election, Milliken declared himself in favor of temperance as well. He ran for re-election the following year against Levi Boone, of the American Party and lost with 47% of the vote.

Following his term as mayor, Milliken stayed in public service, becoming a police magistrate.

He died at his home in Chicago on December 2, 1889, and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery.

<text>Thomas Dyer (January 13, 1805June 6, 1862) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1856–1857) for the Democratic Party. He also served as the founding president of the Chicago Board of Trade.

==Biography==

He was a meat-packing partner of former mayor John Putnam Chapin, who was one of Chicago&#x27;s first meat packers. Chapin built a slaughterhouse on the South Branch of the Chicago River in 1844.

Running as a &quot;pro-Nebraska&quot; Democrat (aligned with Stephen A. Douglas, who publicly backed his candidacy), Dyer won the contentious 1856 Chicago mayoral election, defeating former mayor Francis Cornwall Sherman (who ran as an anti-Nebraska candidate).

He died in Middletown, Connecticut on June 6, 1862, and was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.
