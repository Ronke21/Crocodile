==Notable stories==

== Olympics and Chile ==
Held from August 15 to August 22 in Athens, Greece, it consisted of four events; men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s doubles, and women&#x27;s doubles. The standard 5th event, mixed doubles, was not part of these games. There were 170 participants (87 men and 83 women) from 52 countries. The events were held at the Athens Olympic Tennis Centre at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex. The surface was hardcourt, specifically DecoTurf, the same surface as used at the US Open in Flushing Meadow, New York. The Centre had 16 courts built specifically for the 2004 Olympics, with construction finished just before the opening of the Athens Olympics. There was a main court seating 6,000 fans for the Olympics, two show courts with seating for 3,200 seats during the Olympics, and 16 side courts with limited seating.

Chile won the most medals (three), two of which were gold, led by Nicolás Massú, who won the men&#x27;s singles, and partnered by Fernando González, also helped Chile take gold in the doubles.

===Russian breakthrough===
The year 2004 was well known for the breakthrough of Russian players into the WTA Tour.

At the French Open, Anastasia Myskina became the first woman from Russia to win a Grand Slam singles title, by defeating compatriot Elena Dementieva in the final, 6–1, 6–2. A mere four weeks later, at Wimbledon, 17–year-old Maria Sharapova became the nation&#x27;s second female Grand Slam winner, defeating two-time champion Serena Williams in the final, 6–1, 6–4, and becoming the third-youngest woman (after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis) to win Wimbledon. Finally, at the US Open, Svetlana Kuznetsova became the nation&#x27;s third consecutive winner of a Grand Slam singles title, defeating Dementieva in the final, 6–3, 7–5.

Other Russian players also made an impact on the WTA Tour that year. Nadia Petrova cracked the WTA&#x27;s Top 10 for the first time, and also achieved her biggest result that year, defeating defending US Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne in the fourth round, before losing to Kuznetsova in the quarter-finals. Vera Zvonareva also continued to improve on the Tour before injuries briefly derailed her career the following year.

The conclusion of the season culminated in Sharapova winning the 2004 WTA Tour Championships by repeating her Wimbledon victory over Serena Williams in the final, 4–6, 6–2, 6–4, after coming from 0–4 down in the final set.

<doc id="996241" wikidata="Q4674283" url="?curid=996241" title="Acklins and Crooked Islands">
<text>Acklins and Crooked Islands was a district of the Bahamas until 1996, and as Acklins, Crooked Island and Long Cay until 1999. (islands are located at )

It consisted of a group of islands semi-encircling a large, shallow lagoon called the Bight of Acklins, of which the largest are Crooked Island in the north and Acklins in the south-east, and the smaller are Long Cay (once known as Fortune Island) in the north-west, and Castle Island in the south.

The islands were settled by American Loyalists in the late 1780s who set cotton plantations employing over 1,000 slaves. After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire these became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming.

The main town in the group is Colonel Hill on Crooked Island. Albert Town, on Long Cay, now sparsely populated, was once a prosperous little town. It was engaged in the sponge and salt industries and also served as a transfer port for stevedores seeking work on passing ships.

The population of Acklins was 428, and Crooked Island 350, at the 2000 census.

Since 1999, Acklins and Crooked Island are separate districts.

<text>Mayaguana (from Taíno language &quot;Mayaguana&quot;, meaning &quot;Lesser Midwestern Land&quot;) is the easternmost island and district of The Bahamas. Its population was 277 in the 2010 census. It has an area of about .

About north of Great Inagua and southeast of the capital Nassau, Mayaguana is considered the halfway point between South Florida and Puerto Rico and is about off Palm Beach, Florida. It is a popular stopover for boaters en-route to the eastern Caribbean.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people (Taíno) named the island &quot;Mayaguana&quot; (or &quot;Mariguana&quot;) meaning &quot;lesser mid-western land&quot;.

==History==
Mayaguana was inhabited by Lucayans (Taino) prior to the arrival of the Spanish following 1492. After the last of the Lucayans were carried off to Hispaniola by the Spanish early in the 16th century, the island remained uninhabited until 1812, when people began to migrate from the Turks and Caicos Islands, which are located about southeast.

The Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen suggested in 1824 that Mayaguana is Guanahani, the first island visited by Christopher Columbus at his discovery of the Americas. His theory has found little support. &quot;Mayaguana&quot; apparently was the Lucayan name (meaning &quot;Lesser Midwestern Land&quot; ) for the island.

The first steamship to circumnavigate the globe, the Royal Navy sloop HMS &quot;Driver&quot;, wrecked on Mayaguana on 3 August 1861, 14 years after the completion of her epic voyage in 1847.

During NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury and the Apollo program, the United States space program had a missile tracking station on what is now Mayaguana Airport. The station was used to help keep astronauts on course. The Mayaguana Airport was built by US Army Engineers attached to the US Air Force. The airport was built as a runway for jet planes that would follow missiles fired from Cape Canaveral. Real-time sighting and photography was the best technology of the time for observing the flight of the missiles.

The Bahamian government has recently approved working with American investors MMC to turn Mayaguana into a &quot;free trade zone,&quot; complete with tourism development of approximately 14% of the island. Actually, this is 14% of the total landmass but essentially most of the coastal region. The proposal was met with moderate resistance by Mayaguanians, who look forward to economic expansion but are unsure of what change is to come. This development is still in a planning phase and is trying to maintain the nature of the island as a quiet eco-tourist destination while still creating sustainable economic growth.

==People==

The largest settlement is Abraham&#x27;s Bay (pop. 143) on the south coast; other settlements are the neighboring towns of Betsy Bay (pop. 44) and Pirate&#x27;s Well (pop. 90) in the northwest with the population slowly decreasing. The uninhabited areas of Upper Point (north shore), Northeast Point, and Southeast Point are largely inaccessible by road.

==Culture==
The Betsy Bay Homecoming Festival is held annually in Mayaguana. As of 2020, the All Mayaguana Regatta was also held annually in Mayaguana.

==Economy==
The least developed Bahamian island, Mayaguana has never really seen major growth largely due to the government taking little interest in the economy. However, the government has provided some locals with entry-level positions at various government offices while the local government does its best to provide local jobs. Others make a living by either fishing, farming, petty shops or home businesses, although few.

Considered the most isolated Bahamian island, Mayaguana uses the country&#x27;s mail boat system as its primary form of import and export. Mayaguana is scheduled once a week for delivery and pickup by M/V Lady Rosalind II.

As of 2019, Mayaguana did not have a bank, or even an ATM. Money transfers to and from the island are by money transmission businesses, the Bahamas Postal Service, or by travelors carrying cash.

==Food==

Mayaguana is known for fresh sea food. Sea life regularly caught for commercial purposes include conch, grouper, spiny lobster, snappers and tuna. Marlin and bone fish found in Bahamian waters are fished for sporting activities only.

==Environment==

Mayaguana is known for its woody terrain. Bahamian dry forests&#x27; hardwoods, common lignum-vitae (&quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot;), and holywood lignum-vitae (&quot;G. sanctum&quot;) can be found throughout the island. The island is home to several government nature reserves.

As the southeasternmost island in the Bahamian Commonwealth, Mayaguana is bordered to its east by deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Offshore, there are many underwater coral reefs, as well as shipwrecks.

Mayaguana is home to the Bahamian flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), Bartsch&#x27;s iguanas, plovers, terns, and osprey. Nesting sea turtles can be found throughout the undeveloped northern part of the island. About 118 species of bird are found on the island, including two large brown booby colonies.

==Tourism==

Mayaguana remains one of the most pristine and untouched islands in the Bahamas. Yet the island – home to beautiful beaches, unique wildlife and world-class fishing – has never fully reached its development potential. Most tourists who visit do so for the unspoiled essence of the island. Visitors can also enjoy scuba diving, bonefishing, snorkeling, white-crowned pigeon hunting and bird watching. The eastern part of the island is a popular area for crabbing (catching local island crabs) and off-trail bikers.

Ecotourism is also a growing spectrum. Booby Cay is home to hundreds of iguanas indigenous only to Mayaguana. There is also an interesting species of booby birds that is also found on a separate cay on the northern side of Mayaguana. Blackwood Point, located in upper Pirates Well is where the Bahamian flamingo can be found feeding year round.

The island is accessible by the Mayaguana Airport (MYG), which is located southeast of Abraham&#x27;s Bay and is visited by Bahamasair as well as private aircraft. New construction is set to take place at the Mayaguana Airport before the fourth quarter of 2017.

== Politics ==
The island is part of the MICAL constituency for elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas.

<text>Vrooom (stylised as VROOOM) is an EP by the band King Crimson, classified as a mini-album due to its length. It was released in 1994, as a companion to the subsequent full length album &quot;THRAK&quot; (1995). It is the first King Crimson release to feature the “double trio” of guitarists Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew, bassists Trey Gunn and Tony Levin, and drummers Bill Bruford and Pat Mastelotto.

All of the tracks on &quot;VROOOM&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Cage&quot; and &quot;When I Say Stop, Continue&quot;) were re-recorded for use on the &quot;Thrak&quot; album the following year.

A series of instrumental improvisations recorded during the studio rehearsals for this album, were released five years later, as &quot;The Vrooom Sessions&quot;.

<text>Thrak (stylised in all caps) is the eleventh studio album by the band King Crimson released in 1995 through Virgin Records. It was preceded by the mini-album &quot;Vrooom&quot; in 1994, which contained early versions of some of the same material. It was the group&#x27;s first full-length studio album since &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; eleven years earlier and their only full album to feature the &quot;double trio&quot; lineup of Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin, Trey Gunn, Bill Bruford and Pat Mastelotto. It is the group&#x27;s final studio album to feature either Bruford or Levin.

==Recording==

&quot;Thrak&quot; was recorded in late 1994 at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, England, with producer David Bottrill. Bottrill had previously produced Fripp and David Sylvian&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;The First Day&quot;, which had featured Trey Gunn as a session player. With the band consisting of two guitarists, two bassists and two drummers, the opening track begins with all six musicians in the center of the audio mix; as the album progresses, they are split into two trios, with one in each stereo channel.

Bill Bruford had assumed that this lineup would be a continuation from their work in the 1980s but instead found that the band had adopted a heavier sound that bore a greater resemblance to their 1974 &quot;Red&quot; album.

&quot;Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream&quot; and &quot;One Time&quot; were developed at studio rehearsals for the 1994 mini-album &quot;Vrooom&quot; in Woodstock, New York, during the spring of 1994. Instrumental outtakes and improvisations from these sessions would later be released as &quot;The Vrooom Sessions&quot; in 1999. &quot;Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream&quot; developed from the instrumental outtake &quot;No Questions Asked&quot;.

&quot;Fashionable&quot; was another instrumental from &quot;The Vrooom Sessions&quot; that was re-recorded at Real World during the sessions. It features a guitar line reminiscent of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fashion&quot;, on which Fripp played. Despite being reworked with various additions and refinements by the band members, the piece was ultimately cut from the album.

&quot;Vrooom Vrooom&quot; incorporates a middle section originally composed by Fripp in 1974 for &quot;Red&quot;’s instrumental title track. The band had also experimented with this material in 1983, while working on &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;; evidence of this is the track &quot;Working on Sleepless&quot; from the 2016 compilation &quot;Rehearsals &amp; Blows&quot;.

==Release==
First released on 3 April 1995, &quot;Thrak&quot; reached number 58 in the UK Albums Chart, their most recent release to make the chart. The album was reissued on CD in 2002 in a remastered edition. A significantly different 5.1 surround sound mix by Jakko Jakszyk was released as a CD/DVD-A release in October 2015 for the “40th Anniversary Series”. This edition also featured a reimagined new stereo mix by Fripp and Jakszyk. These two mixes were also included in the 2015 &quot;THRAK BOX&quot; alongside previously unissued studio and live recordings from the period.

==Reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; described &quot;Thrak&quot; as &quot;an absolute monster, a cerebral sextet adventure stunning in its precisely controlled rock power.&quot;

In a retrospective review of the album, Daniel Gioffre of AllMusic called King Crimson &quot;the only progressive rock band from the &#x27;60s to be making new, vital, progressive music in the &#x27;90s&quot; and expressed high regard for the various ways they exploited the double trio format on the album. While noting the album often referenced previous King Crimson works, he felt that this was a subtle acknowledgment of King Crimson&#x27;s established fan base rather than a preoccupation with their own past.

<text>Robert Craggs-Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent, PC (1709 – 13 October 1788) was an Anglo-Irish politician and poet. He was tersely described by Richard Glover as a jovial and voluptuous Irishman who had left &quot;Popery&quot; for the Protestant religion, money and widows.

==Background==
The son of Michael Nugent and Mary, daughter of Robert Barnewall, 9th Baron Trimlestown and Margaret Dongan, he was born at Carlanstown, County Westmeath, in 1709. He succeeded his father in the Carlanstown property on 13 May 1739.

==Political career==
His wife&#x27;s property included the borough of St Mawes in Cornwall, and Nugent sat for that constituency from 1741 to 1754, after which date he represented Bristol until 1774, when he returned to St Mawes. By 1782, he had become the longest continually-serving member of the Commons, and so became the Father of the House.

In 1747 he succeeded Lord Doneraile as Comptroller of the Household to the Prince of Wales. Nugent lent the Prince large sums of money, which were never repaid; the appointments and peerages he received later in life have been attributed to the wish of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s son, George III, to compensate Nugent.

Robert Craggs-Nugent, as he then was, served as a Lord of the Treasury from 1754 to 1759, and was made a Privy Counsellor on 15 December 1759. He was Vice-Treasurer of Ireland from 1759 to 1765, First Lord of Trade from 1766 to 1768, and Vice-Treasurer of Ireland again from 1768 to 1782. In 1768 he was made a member of the Irish Privy Council. His support of the ministry was so useful that he was created in 1767 Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare, and in 1776 Earl Nugent, all Irish peerages.

Apart from his political career, Lord Nugent was also the author of some poetical productions, several of which are preserved in the second volume of Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Collections&quot; (1748).

==Family==

Lord Nugent married firstly, on 14 July 1730, Emilia (died in childbirth 16 August 1731), daughter of Peter Plunkett, 4th Earl of Fingall. They had one son, Edmund, who became a Lieutenant-Colonel and the father of two illegitimate sons (later Field Marshal) Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet, and Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Edmund Nugent) before dying in 1771.

Nugent married secondly, on 23 March 1736, Anna Knight (died 22 November 1756), widow of John Knight and daughter of James Craggs and sister of the Right Honourable James Craggs, the secretary of state. Nugent adopted the surname of Craggs-Nugent. She had already been widowed twice, but Robert, who was born a Roman Catholic, had abandoned his Church very early in life.

He married thirdly, on 2 January 1757, Elizabeth Drax (died 29 January 1792), the widow of the fourth Earl of Berkeley, who brought him a large fortune and with whom he had two daughters.

The earldom descended by special remainder to the earl&#x27;s son-in-law, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, and so to his successors, the dukes of Buckingham and Chandos.

<text>An electric organ, also known as electronic organ, is an electronic keyboard instrument which was derived from the harmonium, pipe organ and theatre organ. Originally designed to imitate their sound, or orchestral sounds, it has since developed into several types of instruments:
* Hammond-style organs used in pop, rock and jazz;
* digital church organs, which imitate pipe organs and are used primarily in churches;
* other types including combo organs, home organs, and software organs.

==History==
===Predecessors===
;Harmonium
The immediate predecessor of the electronic organ was the harmonium, or reed organ, an instrument that was common in homes and small churches in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a fashion not totally unlike that of pipe organs, reed organs generate sound by forcing air over a set of reeds by means of a bellows, usually operated by constantly pumping a set of pedals. The Harmonium used pressure, and the American reed organ or pump organ used suction. While reed organs have limited tonal quality, they are small, inexpensive, self-powered, transportable and self-contained. (Large models were made with multiple manuals, or even pedal boards; in the latter case, the bellows were operated by a leaver or crank on the side by an assistant, or in some late models an electric pump.) The reed organ is thus able to bring an organ sound to venues that are incapable of housing or affording pipe organs. This concept played an important role in the development of the electric organ.

;Pipe organ
In the 1930s, several manufacturers developed electronic organs designed to imitate the function and sound of pipe organs. At the time, some manufacturers thought that emulation of the pipe organ was the most promising route to take in the development of an electronic organ. Not all agreed, however. Various types of electronic organs have been brought to market over the years, with some establishing solid reputations in their own niche markets.

=== (1897–1930s)===
The use of electricity in organs emerged in the first decades of the 20th century, but it was slow to have a major impact. Electrically powered reed organs appeared during the first decades of electricity, but their tonal qualities remained much the same as the older, foot-pumped models.

Thaddeus Cahill&#x27;s gargantuan and controversial instrument, the Telharmonium, which began piping music to New York City establishments over the telephone system in 1897, predated the advent of electronics, yet was the first instrument to demonstrate the use of the combination of many different pure electrical waveforms to synthesize real-world instrument sounds. Cahill&#x27;s techniques were later used by Laurens Hammond in his organ design, and the 200-ton Telharmonium served as the world&#x27;s first demonstration of electrically produced music on a grand scale.

Meanwhile, some further experimentation with producing sound by electric impulses was taking place, especially in France. 

=== (1930s–1975)===


After the failure of the Telharmonium business, similar designs called tonewheel organs were continuously developed; For example:
* &quot;Robb Wave Organ&quot; by Morse Robb (Canada) — developed since c.1923, marketed 1936–1941
* &quot;Rangertone&quot; by Richard Ranger (United States) — marketed c.1932
* &quot;Hammond organ&quot; by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert (United States) — invented in 1934, marketed 1935–1975 (as the tonewheel organs)
* &quot;&quot; by Edwin Welte, &quot;et al.&quot; (Germany) — optical-tonewheel sampling organ, marketed 1935–1940s

One of the earlier electric tonewheel organs was conceived and manufactured by Morse Robb, of the Robb Wave Organ Company. Built in Belleville, Ontario, the Robb Wave Organ predates its much more successful competitor Hammond by patent and manufacture, but shut down its operations in 1938 due to lack of funding.


The first widespread success in this field was a product of the Hammond Clock Company in 1934. The Hammond organ quickly became the successor of the reed organ, displacing it almost completely.

From the start, tonewheel organs operated on a radically different principle from all previous organs. In place of reeds and pipes, Robb and Hammond introduced a set of rapidly spinning magnetic wheels, called tonewheels, which excite transducers that generate electrical signals of various frequencies that are mixed and fed through an amplifier to a loudspeaker. The organ is electrically powered, replacing the reed organ&#x27;s twin bellows pedals with a single swell (or &quot;expression&quot;) pedal more like that of a pipe organ. Instead of having to pump at a constant rate, as had been the case with the reed organ, the organist simply varies the position of this pedal to change the volume as desired. Unlike reed organs, this gives great control over the music&#x27;s dynamic range, while at the same time freeing one or both of the player&#x27;s feet to play on a pedalboard, which, unlike most reed organs, electronic organs incorporate. From the beginning, the electronic organ has had a second manual, also rare among reed organs. While these features mean that the electric organ requires greater musical skills of the organist than the reed organ has, the second manual and the pedalboard along with the expression pedal greatly enhanced playing, far-surpassing the capabilities of the typical reed organ.

The most revolutionary difference in the Hammond, however, is its huge number of tonewheel settings, achieved by manipulating a system of drawbars located near the manuals. By using the drawbars, the organist can combine a variety of electrical tones and harmonics in varying proportions, thus giving the Hammond vast registration. In all, the Hammond is capable of producing more than 250 million tones. This feature, combined with the three-keyboard layout (i.e., manuals and pedalboard), the freedom of electrical power, and a wide, easily controllable range of volume, made the first electronic organs more flexible than any reed organ, or indeed any previous musical instrument except, perhaps, the pipe organ itself.

The classic Hammond sound benefits from the use of free-standing loudspeakers called tone cabinets. The sound is often further enhanced by rotating speaker units, usually manufactured by Leslie.

The Hammond Organ was widely adopted in popular genres such as jazz, gospel, pop music, and rock music. It was utilized by bands such as Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, and Deep Purple, among others. Occasionally the legs would be cut off these instruments to make them easier to transport from show to show. The most popular and emulated organ in the Hammond line is the B3. Although portable &quot;clonewheel organs&quot; started to synthesize and displace the original Hammond tonewheel design in the 1970s, it is still very much in demand by professional organists. The industry continues to see a lively trade in refurbished Hammond instruments, even as technological advances allow new organs to perform at levels unimaginable only two or three decades ago.

=== (1934–1964)===

In the wake of Hammond&#x27;s 1934 invention of the tonewheel organ, competitors explored other possibilities of electric/electronic organ design. Other than the variations of tonewheel organ design, for example, a purely electronic interpretation of the pipe organ (based on &quot;additive synthesis&quot; design) seemed a promising approach. However, it requires a huge number of oscillators, and these circuit scales and complexities were considered a technical bottleneck, as vacuum tube circuits of those days are bulky and unstable. Benjamin Miessner realized that a hybrid approach, using acoustic tone generators along with electronic circuits, could be a reasonable design for commercial products.

The Orgatron was developed in 1934 by Frederick Albert Hoschke, after a Miessner patent. A fan blows air over a set of free reeds, causing them to vibrate. These vibrations are detected by a number of capacitive pickups, then the resulting electric signals are processed and amplified to create musical tones. Orgatron was manufactured by Everett Piano Company from 1935 to 1941. Following World War II and a business transfer, production resumed in 1945 by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company and continued into the early 1960s, including some models retaining the Everett name from 1945 to 1947.

In 1955, the German company Hohner also released two electrostatic reed organs: the Hohnerola and the Minetta, invented by Ernst Zacharias.

In the same decades, similar &quot;electro-acoustic&quot; instruments — &quot;i.e.&quot; electric-fan driven free reed organs with additional electronic circuits — were developed also in Japan. Magna Organ invented in 1934 by a Yamaha engineer, Sei-ichi Yamashita, was a multi-timbral keyboard instrument similar to the Hoschke&#x27;s instrument developed in the same year, although it utilized the microphones in the soundproof box instead of the electrostatic pickups. Initially the Magna Organ was designed as a kind of the additive-synthesizer that summing-up the partials generated by the frequency-multipliers. However, it seems difficult to achieve polyphony without intermodulation distortions with the technology of the 1930s. According to the additional patents and the reviews at that time, its later implemented design, seems to had shifted to a sound-colorization system using the (various) combinations of reed sets, microphones and loudspeakers.

This type of instrument was later re-commercialized: In 1959, Japanese organ builder, Ichirō Kuroda, built his first Croda Organ with each pair of constantly oscillating free reed and a microphone in the soundproof box, and installed at Nishi-Chiba Church in Chiba Prefecture.


=== (1930s–)===
On the other hand, the Hammond Novachord (1939) and other competitors selected the subtractive synthesis design using various combinations of oscillators, filters, and possibly frequency dividers, to reduce the huge number of oscillators, which was the bottleneck of the additive synthesis design. The heat generated by early models with vacuum tube tone generators and amplifiers led to the somewhat derogatory nickname &quot;toaster&quot;. Today&#x27;s solid-state instruments do not suffer from the problem, nor do they require the several minutes that vacuum tube organs need to bring the filament heaters up to temperature.
Electronic organs were once popular home instruments, comparable in price to pianos and frequently sold in department stores. After their début in the 1930s, they captured the public imagination through the recordings of musicians such as Milt Herth (the first performer to record the Hammond Electric Organ) as well as recordings and film performances of Ethel Smith. Nevertheless, they were promoted primarily as church / institutional instruments during the Great Depression and through World War II. After the war, they became more widespread; for example, the Baldwin Piano Company introduced its first in 1946 (with 37 vacuum tubes). Following the adaptation of solid-state electronics to organs in the late 1950s, the market for electronic organs began a fundamental change. Portable electronic keyboards became a regular feature of rock-and-roll music during the 1960s. They are also more convenient to move and store than are the large one-piece organs that had previously defined the market. By the late 1960s, the home organ market was dying while the portable keyboard market was thriving.


=== (1930s–)===
Early electronic organ products released in the 1930s and 1940s were already implemented on frequency divider technology using vacuum tubes or transformer-dividers.

With the development of the transistor, electronic organs that use no mechanical parts to generate the waveforms became practical. The first of these was the frequency divider organ, the first of which uses twelve oscillators to produce one octave of chromatic scale, and frequency dividers to produce other notes. These were even cheaper and more portable than the Hammond. Later developments made it possible to run an organ from a single radio frequency oscillator. Frequency divider organs were built by many companies, and were offered in kit form to be built by hobbyists. A few of these have seen notable use, such as the Lowrey played by Garth Hudson. The design of the Lowrey&#x27;s electronics made it easy to include a pitch-bend feature that is unavailable for the Hammond, and Hudson built a musical style around its use.

=== (1930s–)===


Console organs, large and expensive electronic organ models, resemble pipe organ consoles. These instruments have a more traditional configuration, including full-range manuals, a wider variety of stops, and a two-octave (or occasionally even a full 32-note) pedalboard easily playable by both feet in standard toe-and-heel fashion. (Console organs having 32-note pedalboards are sometimes known as &quot;concert organs&quot;.) Console models, like spinet and chord organs, have internal speakers mounted above the pedals. With their more traditional configuration, greater capabilities, and better performance compared to spinets, console organs are especially suitable for use in small churches, public performance, and even organ instruction. The home musician or student who first learned to play on a console model often found that he or she could later make the transition to a pipe organ in a church setting with relative ease. College music departments made console organs available as practice instruments for students, and church musicians would not uncommonly have them at home.

=== (1940s–)===

During the period from the 1940s through approximately the 1970s, a variety of more modest self-contained electronic home organs from a variety of manufacturers were popular forms of home entertainment. These instruments were much influenced by theatre organs&#x27; sounds and playing style, and often the stops contained imitative voicings such as &quot;trumpet&quot; and &quot;marimba&quot;. In the 1950s–1970s, as technology progressed, they increasingly included automated features such as:
* &quot;Repeat percussion&quot; (Thomas Organ)
* &quot;Sustain&quot; (Gulbransen)
* &quot;Glide&quot; (Lowrey organ in 1956) — 
* &quot;Chimes stop / Piano stop&quot; (Gulbransen)
* &quot;Vocal chorus&quot; (Farfisa Pergamon in 1981)
* &quot;Electronic rhythm&quot; (Wurlitzer Sideman in 1959, Seeburg &amp; Gulbransen in 1964)
* &quot;One-touch chords&quot; (Hammond S-6 Chord Organ in 1950)
* &quot;Automatic Orchestra Control&quot; (Lowrey organ in 1963) — 
* &quot;Autochord&quot; (Hammond Piper in 1970, Lowrey Magic Genie in c.1975)
* &quot;Automatic walking bass&quot; (Gulbransen)
* &quot;Arpeggiator&quot; (Hammond organ, etc.)
* &quot;Built-in Leslie speaker&quot; / &quot;Rotary speaker&quot; (Gulbransen, Lowrey Holiday Deluxe LSL in 1961, etc.)
and even built-in &quot;tape recorders&quot;. These features made it easier to play complete, layered &quot;one-man band&quot; arrangements, especially for people who had not trained as organists. The Lowrey line of home organs is the epitome of this type of instrument.

 are still sold today, , and many of their functions have been incorporated into more modern and inexpensive portable keyboards.


=== (1949–)===
Following World War II, most electronic home organs were built in a configuration usually called a spinet organ, which first appeared in 1949. These compact and relatively inexpensive instruments became the natural successors to reed organs. They were marketed as competitors of home pianos and often aimed at would-be home organists who were already pianists (hence the name &quot;spinet&quot;, in the sense of a small upright piano). The instrument&#x27;s design reflected this concept: the spinet organ physically resembled a piano, and it presented simplified controls and functions that were both less expensive to produce and less intimidating to learn. One feature of the spinet is automatic chord generation; with many models, the organist can produce an entire chord to accompany the melody merely by playing the tonic note, i.e., a single key, on a special section of the manual.

On spinet organs, the keyboards are typically at least an octave shorter than is normal for organs, with the upper manual (typically 44 notes, F3–C7 in scientific pitch notation) omitting the bass, and the lower manual (typically F2–C6) omitting the treble. The manuals are usually offset, inviting but not requiring the new organist to dedicate the right hand to the upper manual and the left to the lower, rather than using both hands on a single manual. The stops on the upper manual were often &#x27;voiced&#x27; somewhat louder or brighter, and user guides encouraged playing the melody on the upper manual and the harmony on the lower. This seemed designed in part to encourage the pianist, who was accustomed to a single keyboard, to make use of both manuals. Stops on such instruments, relatively limited in number, are frequently named after orchestral instruments that they can, at best, only roughly approximate, and are often brightly colored (even more so than those of theatre organs). The spinet organ&#x27;s loudspeakers, unlike the original Hammond models of the 1930s and 1940s, are housed within the main instrument (behind the kickboard), which saved even more space, although they produce a sound inferior to that of free-standing speakers; some models had jacks for installing external speakers, if desired.

The spinet organ&#x27;s pedalboard normally spans only a single octave, is often incapable of playing more than one note at a time, and is effectively playable only with the left foot (and on some models only with the left toes). These limitations, combined with the shortened manuals, make the spinet organ all but useless for performing or practicing classical organ music; but at the same time, it allows the novice home organist to explore the challenge and flexibility of simultaneously playing three keyboards (two hands and one foot). User guides suggest playing the root note of the chord on the pedal. The expression pedal is located to the right and either partly or fully recessed within the kickboard, thus conveniently reachable only with the right foot. This arrangement spawned a style of casual organist who would naturally rest the right foot on the expression pedal the entire time, unlike classically trained organists or performers on the earlier Hammonds. This position, in turn, instinctively encouraged pumping of the expression pedal while playing, especially if already accustomed to using a piano&#x27;s sustain pedal to shape the music. Expressive pumping added a strong dynamic element to home organ music that much classical literature and hymnody lacked, and would help influence a new generation of popular keyboard artists.

=== (1950–)===

Shortly after the debut of the spinet, the chord organ appeared. This is an even simpler instrument designed for those who wanted to produce an organ sound in the home without having to learn much organ (or even piano) playing technique. The typical chord organ has only a single manual that is usually an octave shorter than its already-abbreviated spinet counterpart. It also possesses scaled-down registration and no pedalboard. The left hand operates not a keyboard but an array of chord buttons adapted from those of an accordion.

The original Hammond Chord Organs in 1950 are electronic instruments using vacuum-tube technology. In 1958 Magnus Organ Corporation introduced chord organs similar to an electrically blown reed organ or harmonium.

=== (1957–)===


Electronic organs before the mid-1950s had used vacuum tubes which tended to be bulky and unstable. This restricted attempts to extend features and spread their use into homes. Transistors, invented at Bell Labs in 1947, went into practical production in the 1950s, and their small size and stability led to major changes in the production of electronics equipment, in what has been termed the &quot;transistor revolution&quot;.

In 1957, a home organ manufacturer, Gulbransen, introduced the world&#x27;s first transistor organ, &quot;Model B&quot; (Model 1100). Although it uses transistors for tone generation, vacuum tubes are still used for amplification.
And in 1958, Rodgers built the first fully solid-state transistorized organ for church, called &quot;Opus 1&quot; (Model 38). Other manufacturers followed.


=== (1950s–)===


By the 1960s, electronic organs were ubiquitous in all genres of popular music, from Lawrence Welk to acid rock (e.g. the Doors, Iron Butterfly) to the Bob Dylan album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. In some cases, Hammonds were used, while others featured very small all-electronic instruments, only slightly larger than a modern digital keyboard, called combo organs. (Various portable organs made by Farfisa and Vox were especially popular, and remain so among retro-minded rock combos.) The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s saw increasing specialization: both the gospel and jazz scenes continued to make heavy use of Hammonds, while various styles of rock began to take advantage of increasingly complex electronic keyboard instruments, as large-scale integration and then digital technology began to enter the mainstream.

=== (1970s–)===
An Eminent 310 organ was prominently featured on Jean Michel Jarre&#x27;s albums &quot;Oxygène&quot; (1977) and &quot;Équinoxe&quot; (1978). The Solina String Ensemble was used extensively by pop, rock, jazz, and disco artists, including Herbie Hancock, Elton John, Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, The Carpenters, George Clinton, Eumir Deodato, The Rolling Stones, The Buggles, Rick James, George Harrison, and The Bee Gees.

;Typical features on Synthesizer organs
=== (1971–)===

Allen introduced the world&#x27;s first digital organ (and first digital musical instrument commercial product) in 1971: the Allen Digital Computer Organ. This new technology was developed for use in home organs by North American Rockwell (project leader Ralph Deutsch) and licensed to Allen, which began using it for church organs. Allen later sued Rockwell and Deutsch, and gained sole rights to the digital computer organ technology.

In 1980, Rodgers introduced the first church organs controlled by microprocessors, partially based on research at the University of Bradford. The university&#x27;s &quot;Bradford Computing Organ&quot; has technological descendants in some European digital organs using synthesis technology today.

This style of instrument has also been popular with some classically trained concert organists preferring to avoid learning an unfamiliar pipe organ for every concert location, and wishing to perform in venues without pipe organs. Virgil Fox utilized a large Rodgers organ dubbed &quot;Black Beauty&quot; during his Heavy Organ tour during the early 1970s. From 1977 until his death in 1980, he used a custom Allen electronic organ. Carlo Curley toured with a substantial Allen Organ in the US and with an Allen in the UK. Organist Hector Olivera has toured with a custom Rodgers instrument named &quot;The King,&quot; and Cameron Carpenter has recently begun touring with a custom 5-manual digital organ by Marshall &amp; Ogletree.

=== (1980s–)===


Electronic organs are still made for the home market, but they have been largely replaced by the digital keyboard or synthesizer which is smaller and cheaper than typical electronic organs or traditional pianos. Modern digital organs offer features not found in traditional pipe organs, such as orchestral and percussion sounds, a choice of historical pitch standards and temperaments, and advanced console aids.

Digital organs incorporate real-time tone generation based on sampling or synthesis technologies, and may include MIDI, and Internet connectivity for downloading music data and instructional materials to USB flash drive or media card storage. While much more complex than their predecessors, their basic appearance makes them instantly recognizable.

The best digital organs of the 2000s incorporate these technical features:
;DSP technology
In 1990, Rodgers introduced software-based digital church organs with technology which connected multiple Digital Signal Processors (DSP) in parallel to generate pipe organ sound with stereo imaging. Sounds in other digital organs are derived from DSPs in either a sampled or synthesis type generation system. Sampled technologies use sounds recorded from various ranks of pipe organs. In synthesis systems, the wave shape is created by tone generators instead of using a sound sample. Both systems generate organ tones, sometimes in stereo in better systems, rather than simply playing recorded tones as a simple digital keyboard sampler might do. Marketed by Eminent, Wyvern, Copeman Hart, Cantor, and Van der Pole in Europe, synthesis organs may use circuitry purchased from Musicom, an English supply company. In the digital organ category, synthesis-based systems are rarely seen outside of Europe.

;Sampling
Many digital organs use high-quality samples to produce an accurate sound. Sampled systems may have samples of organ pipe sound for each individual note, or may use only one or a few samples which are then frequency-shifted to generate the equivalent of a 61-note pipe rank. Some digital organs like Walker Technical and the very costly Marshall &amp; Ogletree organs use longer samples for additional realism, rather than having to repeat shorter samples in their generation of sound. Sampling in 2000s-era organs is typically done with 24-bit or 32-bit resolution, at a higher rate than the 44.1 kHz of CD-quality audio having 16-bit resolution.

;Surround sound
On most digital organs, several audio channels are used to create a more spacious sound. Higher-quality digital organ builders use custom audio and speaker systems and may provide from 8 to 32 or more independent channels of audio, depending on the size of the organ and the budget for the instrument. With dedicated high-power subwoofers for the lowest frequencies, digital organs can approach the physical sensation of a pipe organ.

;Pipe organ simulations
To better simulate pipe organs, some digital organs emulate changes of windchest pressure caused by the air pressure dropping slightly when many notes are sounding simultaneously, which changes the sound of all the pipes.

Digital organs may also incorporate simulated models of swell boxes which mimic the environmental effects on pipes, pipe chest valve release, and other pipe organ characteristics. These effects can be included in the sound of modern digital organs to create more realistic pipe organ tone.

Digital pipe sound can include sampled or modeled room acoustics. Rodgers uses binaural and crosstalk cancellation processing to create real-time acoustic models, and Allen also uses room acoustics as part of the sound generation.

=== (1990s–)===

The data processing power of PCs has made personal organs more affordable. Software applications can store digital pipe sound samples and combine them in real time in response to input from one or more MIDI controllers. These tools can be used to assemble home-built organs that can rival the sound quality of commercially built digital organs at a relatively low cost.
==In churches==

===Pipe-electronic hybrid organs (1930s–)===
Early combinations of pipe organs and electronic technology (including the electronic tone generators, at later) were developed in the 1930s. Custom electronic organ consoles occasionally replace aging pipe consoles, updating the electrical control system for the pipes as well as adding electronic voices to the organ. Even large pipe organs are often supplemented with electronic voices for the deepest bass tones that would otherwise require 16- to 32-foot pipes.

For hybrid organs that combine pipes and electronic sounds, pipes change their pitch with environmental changes, but electronic voices do not follow by default. The frequency of sound produced by an organ pipe depends on its geometry and the speed of sound in the air within it. These change slightly with temperature and humidity, so the pitch of an organ pipe will change slightly as the environment changes. The pitch of the electronic portion of a hybrid instrument must be re-tuned as needed. The simplest method is a manual control that the organist can adjust, but some recent digital models can make such adjustments automatically.

===Electronic church organs (1939–)===
The first &quot;full&quot; electronic church organ was built in 1939 by Jerome Markowitz, founder of the Allen Organ Company, who had worked for years to perfect the replication of pipe organ sound through the use of oscillator circuitry based on radio tubes. In 1958, Rodgers Organ Company built the first solid-state, transistorized church organ, its three-manual Opus 1.

In contrast to frequency divider circuitry with only a few independent pitch sources, quality electronic church organs have at least one oscillator per note and often additional sets to create a superior ensemble effect. For instance, Rodgers Opus 1 featured eight sets of transistorized pitch generators. Even today, digital organs use software-based digital oscillators to create large numbers of independent pitch and tone sources to better simulate the effect of a large pipe organ.

===Digital church organs (1971–)===
Digital church organs are designed as pipe organ replacements or as digital consoles to play existing pipes. The differences in sound timbre between piped and digital instruments are debated, but modern digital organs are less expensive and more space efficient.

Digital organs are a viable alternative for churches that may have a pipe organ and can no longer afford to maintain it. Some pipe organs, on the other hand, might be playable without major rebuilding for many decades. However the high initial cost, and longer lead time to design, build, and &quot;voice&quot; pipe organs has limited their production.

Most new digital church organs synthesize sounds from recorded pipe samples, although some model the pipe sound by additive synthesis. Modelling the sound is done by a professional organ &quot;voicer&quot;, who finishes the organ in its location, much like the process of regulating and voicing a pipe organ. These organs also use high-quality custom-designed audio systems. The builders of both custom and factory digital church organs include the firms of Ahlborn-Galanti, Allen, Eminent, Johannus, Makin, Rodgers, Viscount, and Wyvern.

<doc id="996256" wikidata="Q3186067" url="?curid=996256" title="Josie and the Pussycats (comics)">
<text>Josie and the Pussycats (initially published as She&#x27;s Josie and Josie) is a teen-humor comic book about a fictional rock band, created by Dan DeCarlo and published by Archie Comics. It was published from 1963 until 1982; since then, one-shot issues have appeared on an irregular basis. A second series, set in the New Riverdale universe, launched in September 2016.

The series was adapted into a Saturday morning cartoon by Hanna–Barbera in 1970 and a live-action motion picture by Universal Studios and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2001; each of these productions was accompanied by a Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack album. A completely African-American version of the band also appeared in the drama series &quot;Riverdale&quot; on The CW, after which the character Josie joined &quot;Katy Keene&quot;.

==Publication history==
Cartoonist Dan DeCarlo, who had spent most of the 1950s drawing teen and career-girl humor comics such as &quot;Millie the Model&quot; for Atlas Comics, that decade&#x27;s forerunner of Marvel Comics, began freelancing for Archie Comics. In 1960, he and Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee co-created the short-lived syndicated comic strip &quot;Willie Lumpkin&quot;, about a suburban mail carrier, for the Chicago, Illinois-based Publishers Syndicate. Casting about for more comic-strip work, DeCarlo created the characters of Josie and her friends. Josie DeCarlo, the artist&#x27;s wife and Josie&#x27;s namesake, explained that &quot;We went on a Caribbean cruise, and I had a [cat] costume for the cruise, and that&#x27;s the way it started.&quot;

DeCarlo first tried to sell the character as a syndicated comic strip called &quot;Here&#x27;s Josie&quot;, recalling in 2001:
Josie was introduced in a solo series, &quot;She&#x27;s Josie&quot;. The first issue was cover-dated February 1963. The series featured levelheaded, sweet-natured redhead Josie, her ditzy blonde bombshell friend Melody, and the brainy, cynical, bespectacled brunette Pepper. These early years also featured the characters of Josie&#x27;s beatnik boyfriend Albert; Pepper&#x27;s strong but not-too-bright boyfriend Socrates (&quot;Sock&quot; for short); Albert&#x27;s rival Alexander Cabot III, who chased after both Josie and Melody; and Alex&#x27;s obnoxious twin sister Alexandra Cabot. None of the mainstream Archie characters appeared with Josie until the ninth issue of her own title. Josie and her friends occasionally appeared in &quot;crossover&quot; issues with the main Archie characters. &quot;She&#x27;s Josie&quot; displayed a new &quot;Josie&quot;-only logo beginning with issue #14 (August, 1965), was officially renamed &quot;Josie&quot; with issue #17 (December, 1965), and again renamed, to &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, with issue #45 (December, 1969). The series finished its run under this title with issue #106 (October, 1982). Josie and her gang also made irregular appearances in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; and &quot;Laugh Comics&quot; during the 1960s.

In 1969, Archie Comics made several changes to the &quot;Josie&quot; comic:
* In &quot;Josie&quot; #42 (August 1969), Josie met a heavily built blond folk singer named Alan M. who, over time, became Josie&#x27;s on-again, off-again boyfriend (much to the chagrin of Alexandra, who was also immediately smitten with Alan M. and never missed an opportunity to try and steal him away).
* In &quot;Josie&quot; #43 (September 1969), Alexandra discovered that her cat Sebastian was actually a reincarnation of an ancestor of the Cabot family, who was executed for consorting with witches. Whenever Alexandra held Sebastian in her arms, she could cast magic spells. Alexandra generally used her powers to compete with Josie for Alan M., but the spells she cast usually backfired in some way. Moreover, her spells ended whenever someone nearby snapped their fingers (which happened often). Alexandra and Sebastian&#x27;s witchy powers were not used in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s TV show, and they were soon discontinued in the comic as well.
* In &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; #45 (December 1969), the first issue to bear that new title, Josie and Melody decided to start a band called the Pussycats. Alexandra was asked to be their bassist, but she insisted that the group&#x27;s name be to &quot;Alexandra&#x27;s Cool Time Cats&quot;; so, instead, Valerie Smith, a new girl in school, was recruited to play bass. The Pussycats made their leopard print band uniforms (complete with cat-ear headbands and long tails) and performed at their first gig, a school dance, as a seething Alexandra tried unsuccessfully to use her witchcraft for revenge.

The reimagining of the comic resulted in three casualties: Albert, Sock, and Pepper, who were phased out altogether. From 1970 on, most of the stories in the comic book revolved around the Pussycats traveling around the country and the world to perform gigs, with Alan M., Alex, and Alexandra (and sometimes Sebastian) in tow. When the girls were not performing, they dealt with the various trials and tribulations of teenage life, often including Alex&#x27;s jealousy of Alan M. and Alexandra&#x27;s jealousy of Josie. The &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; comic ran until 1982, after which the girls were featured in various &quot;Archie Giant Series&quot; issues and miniseries and one-shot comics of their own. Reprinted &quot;Josie&quot; stories (including the occasional pre-Pussycats stories) appear frequently in the various &quot;Archie Library&quot; digests. &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; #47-95 (June 2001-November 2005) featured new Josie and the Pussycats stories in the regular house style after the 2001 film renewed interest in the series. They later appeared in a new two-part story, &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, in &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; #130-131 (June–July 2009).

===Manga makeover===
In March 2005, Archie Comics announced that a manga version of the title would be published, with art by Tania del Rio, who was also responsible for the manga makeover of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;. The first such &quot;Josie and the Pussycasts&quot; story, &quot;Opening Act&quot; ran in &quot;Tales from Riverdale Digest&quot; #3 (August 2005) The band had previously appeared in manga form in issue &quot;Sabrina, The Teenage Witch&quot; #67 (August 2005).

In &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; #96 (January 2006) the origin of the Pussycats was retconned. The manga version implies that none of the characters previously knew each other. Josie Jones was cut from the school choir, but met Valerie Smith and the two founded the band. They recruited Melody, whose idea it was to wear cat outfits. The band was not doing well at first, but Alex liked the group, though Alexandra could tell he was more interested in Josie. Alex&#x27;s father let him be the manager as long as he did not use his wealth to help make them stars. In &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; #72 (February 2006), a stranger named Alan helped carry their equipment. Josie, already attracted to Alan, jealously thought there was an attraction between Alan and Melody. Alex hired him as their stagehand.

The manga focused on the group&#x27;s attempt to reach fame rather than on their career after they have already achieved it. It featured characters not seen in other comics, including Alan&#x27;s younger sister Alison and the rival group the Vixens. The manga version was not popular among readers, who preferred the traditional style. Its final appearance was in &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; #104 (December 2006). A Katy Keene revival replaced it (both featured alongside each other in the latter part of the manga&#x27;s run), though it, too, did not last.

===Afterlife with Archie===
In the world of &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Josie and the Pussycats are revealed to be vampires. Josephine McCoy is orphaned shortly after her birth in 1906 and winds up in an orphanage run by Alexandra Cabot, who has three other children: Melody, Valerie, and Pepper. Due to their singing talent, &quot;Uncle Buddy&quot; (one of Alexandra&#x27;s friends) takes the trio on tour, eventually forcing Pepper to marry him. Shortly after this, Josie, Melody and Valerie are turned into vampires. The three then go on to become several short lived groups, with &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; being the latest incarnation. In the 1980s, Pepper finds Josie and tries to blackmail Josie into turning her into a vampire. Josie tries to explain that becoming a vampire locks you into the state you were in when you were turned. Pepper won&#x27;t listen and Josie is forced to kill her childhood friend. Josie them mesmerizes the interviewer she has been telling this to so the three of them can feed. Later on, on their jet, they detect irregularities at their destination of Riverdale, deciding to land there anyway rather than detour.

===Reboot===
On June 8, 2016, a reboot of the series was announced in the same style of the Archie, Jughead, and Betty &amp; Veronica reboots as part of the New Riverdale imprint. The series is co-written by Marguerite Bennett and Cameron DeOrdio with the art by Audrey Mok. The reboot features Josie uniting the band to take their big shot at musical stardom, only to contend with the machinations of Alexandra Cabot, the ever-Machiavellian sister of the Pussycats’ manager. The first issue was released on September 28, 2016.

==Characters==

===Josie===
A short-haired redhead, Josie is the leader and co-founder of the Pussycats. She is the lead vocalist and songwriter and plays guitar. Portrayed as a sweet, attractive, and level-headed teenage girl, Josie is usually the stable center in the middle of the chaos surrounding her band and her friends.

Josie&#x27;s surname has been inconsistent. It was alternately &quot;Jones&quot; or &quot;James&quot; for much of the comic&#x27;s run. McCoy was her surname for the 2001 movie. Archie Comics later sometimes acknowledged the surnames from the movie as canonical, though not consistently. In a few stories reprinted in the 2000s decade, Archie Comics changed her surname to McCoy. However, the manga version used &quot;Jones&quot;, which was her first surname to actually appear in the comics.

During the early years of her comic (1963–1969), Josie dated a guitarist named Albert. During and after the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; revamp, she dated Alan M. Mayberry. Alexander Cabot is regularly attracted to her in the comics. Though she is known to date him, she really loves Alan M.

In the cartoon series, Josie&#x27;s speaking voice was performed by Janet Waldo (the voice of Judy Jetson and Penelope Pitstop) and her singing voice was performed by Cathy Dougher. She was played by Rachael Leigh Cook in the 2001 live-action &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; movie (singing voice performed by Kay Hanley). She appeared in The CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot; with Ashleigh Murray portraying her as an African American and lead singer of the band. Murray eventually left the show and joined the spinoff &quot;Katy Keene&quot;. She returns as a special guest star in the musical episode &quot;Chapter Ninety-One: The Return of the Pussycats&quot;, which is centered on her, Pussycats Valerie and Melody, and Alexandra Cabot.

Josie was ranked 77th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

===Melody Valentine===
The co-founder and drummer for the Pussycats (she also sang occasional lead vocals for the TV series), Melody is a cute, vivacious blonde and usually speaks in a sing-song voice, denoted by the musical notes in her cartoon word balloons. She is a slightly ditzy, bubbly sort of character, often taken to using silly nonsense language and provides much of the comic relief of the series.

Melody is almost never given a surname in a comic story. Occasionally, she is called &quot;Melody Jones&quot;. At these times, the name &quot;James&quot; is used for Josie to avoid confusion. However, the manga, having settled on the name &quot;Josie Jones&quot;, essentially nullifies this. The 2001 movie establishes her surname as Valentine, a name that Archie Comics has accepted.

Many comic stories use Melody&#x27;s beauty as a plot device. When male characters see her, they uncontrollably fall for her and lose all sense of anything else, frequently leading to chaos; although, she is usually oblivious to this. Despite any trouble that occurs for her or her friends, Melody maintains a cheerful, optimistic attitude.

In the cartoon series, whenever the group is in a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation, Melody&#x27;s ears would wiggle. She is frequently brainwashed by villains, but is already rather scatterbrained. Later, in the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; series, she adopts a cute little alien named &quot;Bleep&quot;.

Melody&#x27;s speaking voice is performed by Jackie Joseph, and her singing voice is performed by Cheryl Ladd (credited as Cherie Moor). She was played by Tara Reid in the live-action film. Bleep&#x27;s voice was done by Don Messick (also the voice of Scooby-Doo, Astro, Dr. Benton Quest, Boo Boo Bear, and more). Ashanti Bromfield portrayed her in the CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

===Valerie Brown===
In addition to being the group&#x27;s main songwriter and a multi-instrumentalist, dark-haired Valerie also performs back-up vocals (in the comics, cartoons, and the movie) and occasionally sings lead (nearly always in the TV series) for the Pussycats. In the comics and the movie, she is the group&#x27;s dedicated bassist; in the cartoons, she plays tambourine. In the comic book, she replaced Pepper, a sharp-minded spectacled brunette.

Valerie&#x27;s surname may be the most definite of the three. Archie Comics have occasionally used the name &quot;Brown&quot; from the movie on their website and in promotional material, but in the comics, she is always called Valerie Smith. But recently, the &quot;Brown&quot; surname has been used again in comics and the &quot;Riverdale&quot; TV series. The return of the Brown surname happens due to the return of the Pepper Smith character in the New Riverdale and Archie Horror universe.

In the comics, Valerie is more tomboyish than her two bandmates. Besides being good at science and a skilled auto mechanic, she occasionally shows a quick temper as well as being physically stronger than she might appear. She is also less concerned about her appearance or her love life than Josie, Melody or Alexandra, and had rarely been seen in a romantic relationship, though in the cartoons she seems attracted to Alexander. In 2010, she began an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Archie Andrews, although her band&#x27;s touring schedule often keeps her out of Riverdale and away from Archie (much to the relief of Veronica Lodge and Betty Cooper, Archie&#x27;s other girlfriends).

In the animated series, she is somewhat similar to Velma Dinkley from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and they met in a 1973 episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Showboat&quot;. She is the character who saves the day the most often, thanks to her street smarts and her mechanical and scientific genius. In the comics, this is downplayed, although she is still the most intelligent of the group. Valerie is the first African-American (non-white) female cartoon character on a regular animated television series.

Valerie&#x27;s speaking voice is performed by Barbara Pariot, and her singing voice is performed by Patrice Holloway, sister of Motown recording artist Brenda Holloway. She was played by Rosario Dawson in the live-action film. Hayley Law portrayed her in the CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

===Alexander Cabot III===
Rich, temperamental, and cowardly, Alexander is the Pussycats&#x27; shifty and not-too-dependable manager. He often gets the group in hot water because of his crazy promotional schemes. Alexander wears sunglasses often and likes to flaunt his wealth, typically dressing in flamboyant and expensive clothing.

In the comics, Alexander is reminiscent of Reggie Mantle. He has a crush on Josie and often tries to divert her attention from her boyfriend, Alan M. He is blunt and critical towards Alan M., regarding him as all brawn and no brains. Occasionally, Alexander will take an interest in Melody, particularly when Josie is unavailable. The interest seems genuine, since, unlike other boys, who fall helplessly in love with Melody at first sight, Alexander tends to remain composed around her.

Alexander&#x27;s personality is markedly different in the animated series; he is much friendlier, though no more dependable and far more cowardly than his comic strip alter ego. In this context, he most often serves as a comedic foil for Alexandra&#x27;s constant scheming. The animated version of Alexander also exhibits no romantic feelings towards Josie, tends to gravitate towards Melody or Valerie, depending on interpretation, and is very similar to Shaggy Rogers from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.

The animated depiction of Alexander was voiced by Casey Kasem, who also voiced Shaggy. In a 1973 &quot;Josie&quot;-guested episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, Alexander and Shaggy both appear on-screen together for quite some time. Alexander was played by Paulo Costanzo in the 2001 live-action motion picture. He appears 
as a supporting regular character on The CW&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Katy Keene,&quot; portrayed by Lucien Laviscount.

===Alexandra Cabot and Sebastian===
Alexandra is technically a supporting character, but often overshadows the rest of the cast in both the comics and the cartoons. She is Alexander&#x27;s fraternal twin sister in the comics; the 1970 cartoon series does not establish the siblings as twins, but that Alexandra is the younger sibling.

Alexandra is usually depicted as having black hair with a white lightning-bolt shaped stripe running through the middle of it, giving her ponytail a slight impression of a skunk&#x27;s tail. In some early comics, however, she sports a short bob minus the streak.
In contrast to the good-natured girls in the Pussycats, Alexandra is cynical, hateful, cantankerous, mean, offensive, rude, envious, scheming and self-centered. She is insanely jealous of the Pussycats, especially Josie, who she never has a kind word about. Despite having no vocal or musical talent at all, Alexandra desperately wants to be a star; her conditions for joining the Pussycats were that she be made the lead and that the band be renamed Alexandra&#x27;s Cool Time Cats.

Alexandra has an enormous crush on Alan M., and often tries to steal him away from Josie. In the comics, although she is not particularly fond of her brother, Alexandra often joins forces with him to separate Alan M. and Josie, which would benefit both siblings, since Alexander is interested in Josie. Alexandra&#x27;s personality in the cartoon is largely unchanged.

Sebastian is a tuxedo cat, and Alexandra&#x27;s sidekick. In the comics, Sebastian is the reincarnation of Sebastian Cabot, a witchcraft-practicing ancestor of the Cabot family. Alexandra finds that, by holding Sebastian in her arms, she can cast powerful magic spells (Alexandra and Sebastian&#x27;s bond is represented in that they both have a matching white stripe in the middle of their hair/fur). This plot device was sporadically employed by various writers at Archie over the years; Alexandra was later shown to be able to cast spells on her own. In the cartoon, Alexandra and Sebastian do not have magic powers but they still have their white stripes. Sebastian usually follows Alexandra&#x27;s schemes when it comes to getting in between Josie and Alan, but unlike Alexandra, he has no real grudge or dislike towards Josie and is usually shown to be friendly to her.

Alexandra&#x27;s voice in the cartoons is provided by former Mouseketeer Sherry Alberoni, while Don Messick supplies the meows, screams, and Muttley-esque snickers for Sebastian. Alexandra was played by Missi Pyle in the live-action &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; movie, while Sebastian does not appear in the live-action film.

Alexandra appears as a supporting regular character who dislikes Josie McCoy on The CW&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, portrayed by Camille Hyde. This version of Alexandra is the senior vice president of Cabot Entertainment. Similar to in the comics, she dislikes Josie. In &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, Alexander and Alexandra are step-siblings (posing as twins in public), a relationship complicated by their having dated in high school before Alexander&#x27;s father and Alexandra&#x27;s mother later married. Hyde also reprised her role in the musical episode &quot;Chapter Ninety-One: The Return of the Pussycats&quot; from the fifth season of &quot;Riverdale&quot;. Sebastian is mentioned in two episodes of Katy Keene.

===Alan M. Mayberry===
Alan M. Mayberry (known as &quot;Alan M.&quot; in the comics, and as simply &quot;Alan&quot; in the cartoon series) is a tall, blond, muscular folk singer who serves as the Pussycats&#x27; roadie. He is also Josie&#x27;s on-off boyfriend, but Alexandra is constantly trying to win a date with him.

In the comics, he replaced Josie&#x27;s former boyfriend and Alex&#x27;s former rival Albert. In his first comic book appearance, the creators tried to give him and Alex their own band, The Jesters, but it did not last beyond one issue, and the comic took a different direction. Though Alex looks down on Alan M. and insults his intelligence, Alan M. has more common sense than Alex does. Despite being one of the six main characters, he appeared less often in the comics in the 1980s onward.

In the cartoon series, he plays the role of the self-appointed group leader, similar to that of Fred Jones from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (and perhaps not coincidentally does bear some resemblance to him as well). His and Alex&#x27;s characters were changed in an attempt to recapture &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;&#x27;s success.

Alan M.&#x27;s animated persona is voiced by Jerry Dexter. He was played by Gabriel Mann in the live-action film. In &quot;Riverdale&quot;, he appears as a guest character in the musical episode &quot;Chapter Ninety-One: The Return of the Pussycats&quot;, portrayed by Chris McNally.

===Other recurring characters===
* Pepper Smith: Josie&#x27;s best friend in the original comics, and, until the 1969 renovation, one of the main five characters (along with Josie, Melody, Albert and Alex). She had short-cropped black hair, conservative spectacles, wore clothes that were less formfitting than her friends, and was noted for her sharp wit and cynical nature. She dated Sock, but to his frustration, she preferred to remain emotionally reserved when it came to boys. The original comic focused on three girls (a redhead, a brunette and a blonde) who were frequently seen together, but Pepper was dropped from the comics and replaced by Valerie. This change has no explanation, as Albert and Pepper&#x27;s roles are similar to their replacements’. Pepper made a small cameo appearance in Part 3 of 2007&#x27;s “Civil Chore” in &quot;Tales from Riverdale&quot; (Alan M. was notably absent). Pepper later had a more prominent role in the 2016-17 &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; comic series by Marguerite Bennett and Cameron DeOrdio. She appears as a lead character in The CW&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, portrayed by Julia Chan.
* Albert: Sometimes seen as a mischievous goofball, but at other times quite sensitive, he was Josie&#x27;s boyfriend in the original comics and one of the original male leads. He was also Alex&#x27;s rival. However, while the Pussycats-era Alex was similar to Reggie Mantle, Albert and Alex were more like a male Betty and Veronica: good friends until it came to the girl they competed for. Alexandra tried unsuccessfully to get him to date her. Albert was fond of playing the guitar and singing, and also liked to ride his motor scooter. Often portrayed as member of the 1960s counterculture, he went from being a beatnik to a folk singer to a mod and finally to a hippie (depending on the year of the issue) before he was finally dropped from the comics. Alan M. would fill his old role. Since then, he, Pepper and a few other characters would only appear in stories reprinted in digests.
* Sock: His real name was Socrates, and he was a jock who dated Pepper and was a good friend of Albert&#x27;s. Like a stereotypical jock, he was not very intelligent, but this was not exaggerated as it is with Moose Mason. Despite lasting up to and including Alan M.&#x27;s first story, he, like Alexandra, remained a supporting character. Unlike Albert and Pepper, he was removed from the comics with no actual replacement character.
* Alexander Cabot II: Alex and Alexandra&#x27;s very rich father. He is slightly heavyset, his hair is turning white, and he is often frustrated with the ideas of his children. He insists that the band his son manages earn their own fame without the help of his millions. He appears as a guest character in The CW&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, portrayed by Peter Francis James.
* Josie&#x27;s father: He is a slim, middle-aged man who has dark hair with a wisp of gray. His name, depending on the source, is Mr. McCoy, Mr. Jones or Mr. James. He is totally supportive of his daughter&#x27;s music career. In &quot;Riverdale&quot;, he is named Myles McCoy and he appears as a guest character, portrayed by Reese Alexander.
* Cricket O&#x27;Dell: The familiar &quot;Archie&quot; character made a few appearances in the original &quot;Josie&quot; comics. A pert, friendly girl with an amazing talent: she is able to smell money or monetary values. In &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, she appears as a recurring character and was portrayed by Azriel Crews. 
* Sheldon: A short, fat glutton from a few stories in the late 1960s who occasionally dated Melody. Despite his lack of importance, his final appearance was after the Pussycats&#x27; makeover.
* Clyde Didit: Best known as the star of &quot;Archie&#x27;s Mad House&quot;, Clyde appeared for a few issues in &quot;Josie&quot; in the late 1960s.
* Mr. Tuttle: The principal of Midvale High School where Josie and her friends attend. He made a number appearances in the pre-Pussycats comics.
* Archie&#x27;s Gang: The main characters often crossover with Josie and the Pussycats (and vice versa), sometimes in stories involving the Archies.
* The Vixens: A rival rock trio that Alexandra manages. Although they are glamorous, they have no musical talent (a fact that Alexandra somehow overlooked). Exclusive to the manga version.

===Film===
====Live-action====
&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; is a 2001 Canadian-American musical comedy film released by Universal Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Directed and co-written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, the film is loosely based upon the comic and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon. The film is about a young all-female band that signs a record contract with a major record label, only to discover that the company does not have the musicians&#x27; best interests at heart. The film stars Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson as the Pussycats, with Alan Cumming, Parker Posey, and Gabriel Mann in supporting roles. The film received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb, earning about $15 million against a $39 million budget.

===Television===
====Animated====

During the 1968-1969 television season, the first &quot;Archie&quot;-based Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;The Archie Show,&quot; debuted on CBS. &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, produced by Filmation Studios, was not only a hit on TV, but spun off a radio hit as well (the Archies&#x27; song &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; hit the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in September 1969 and went on to be &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s number one &quot;Hot 100 Single&quot; of that year). Competing animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting another of its properties into a similar show. Archie Comics offering to redevelop the &quot;Josie&quot; series into one about a teenage music band, and allowing Hanna-Barbera to adapt it into a music-based Saturday morning show. The show aired 16 episodes during the 1970-71 television season. In the 1972-73 television season, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space and aired another 16 episodes. After the show&#x27;s cancellation, Josie and the Pussycats made a final appearance in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973 episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Showboat&quot;.

In the wake of the 2001 feature film, DiC Entertainment, a company with extensive ties to Archie Comics, announced it had bought merchandising and adaptation rights to the characters and was planning to create a cartoon with them. However, production on this was never completed. Not much is known about what this series could have been, but had it been completed, it would have been co-produced and distributed with Riverdale Productions, a joint venture of Archie and MultiModal Media Group.

====Live-action====
Josie and the Pussycats appear in &quot;Riverdale&quot; on The CW. They are high school students who are dedicated to perfecting the &quot;Pussycat&quot; brand. Ashleigh Murray portrays Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; McCoy, named for Josephine Baker, whose father is a jazz musician and wishes his daughter played more serious music. Her mother is Riverdale&#x27;s mayor. Asha Bromfield and Hayley Law portray Melody Valentine and Valerie Brown, respectively.

Josie would later emigrate to the spin-off series &quot;Katy Keene&quot; as an adult, with Murray reprising her role. In this, Josie finds two new Pussycats, Cricket O&#x27;dell and Trula Twyst portrayed by Azriel Patricia and Emily Rafala.

<text>Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł (1 July 1593 – 12 November 1656) was a Polish nobleman, a Reichfürst and a politician from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, who served as the Lithuanian Vice-chancellor from 1619, the Lithuanian Grand Chancellor and starosta of Vilnius from 1623. He was a member of the powerful Radziwiłł family, last of the Ołyka line, fourth to bear the name of Albrycht. During his life he was an influential magnate and diplomat in the country. Radziwiłł was a vigorous Roman Catholic and staunch supporter of Counter-Reformation, but also the arch enemy of the Protestant community.

==Biography==
He was born on 1 July 1593 in his family manor in Ołyka to Stanisław Pius Radziwiłł and Marianna née Myszka. During his life Albrycht held several important posts in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, some of them hereditary. Apart from directing his family estate in Ołyka at Volhynia (&quot;ordynacja ołycka&quot;), he was in charge of foreign policies and internal affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as he held the posts Lithuanian Vice-chancellor (since 1619), Grand Chancellor of Lithuania and starosta of Vilnius (since 1623), as well as governor of Kowel, Tuchola, Gniew, Pinskas, Wieluń, Daugpilis, Kobrynas and Šiauliai.

Supporter of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III Vasa, he often stood in opposition to his son and successor, Władysław IV Vasa on the matters of religion. Władysław was lenient towards Protestants and encouraged religious tolerance, while Albrycht was an outspoken opponent of all non-Catholics, sometimes even refusing to stamp documents with his Chancellor&#x27;s seal granting them rights and privileges. He was also a patriot of Grand Duchy: he always strived to ensure that there is no discrimination towards his compatriots and they have equal representation in the Commonwealth federal political structure, just as he tried to ensure that non-Catholics had as little of it as possible. In his opposition to heretics he was supported by Chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński. He sympathized with the Habsburg faction and supported Queen Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Habsburg wife of King Władysław IV.

Just like the other Radziwiłł family members, he was famous for the support given to his relatives: he did not fail to watch over the interests of his Calvinist cousins, despite being renowned for his opposition to the heretics.

Despite being one of the most powerful magnates in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, both of his marriages (with Regina von Eisenreich in 1619, court lady of Queen Constance and after her death in 1637 with Anna Krystyna Działyńska-Lubomirska in 1638) were childless.

During later stages of his life, Radziwiłł wrote a diary &quot;Memoriale rerum gestarum in Polonia&quot; (&quot;Memoir&quot; or &quot;Diary of the history of Poland&quot;) covering the 1632–1656 period. This book is perhaps his most famous legacy.

He died childless on 12 November 1656. His estates were inherited by Ordynat of Nesvyžius line of Radziwiłł family.

<doc id="996278" wikidata="Q911331" url="?curid=996278" title="Molecular geometry">
<text>Molecular geometry is the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms that constitute a molecule. It includes the general shape of the molecule as well as bond lengths, bond angles, torsional angles and any other geometrical parameters that determine the position of each atom.

Molecular geometry influences several properties of a substance including its reactivity, polarity, phase of matter, color, magnetism and biological activity. The angles between bonds that an atom forms depend only weakly on the rest of molecule, i.e. they can be understood as approximately local and hence transferable properties.

== Determination ==
The molecular geometry can be determined by various spectroscopic methods and diffraction methods. IR, microwave and Raman spectroscopy can give information about the molecule geometry from the details of the vibrational and rotational absorbance detected by these techniques. X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction and electron diffraction can give molecular structure for crystalline solids based on the distance between nuclei and concentration of electron density. Gas electron diffraction can be used for small molecules in the gas phase. NMR and FRET methods can be used to determine complementary information including relative distances,
dihedral angles,

angles, and connectivity. Molecular geometries are best determined at low temperature because at higher temperatures the molecular structure is averaged over more accessible geometries (see next section). Larger molecules often exist in multiple stable geometries (conformational isomerism) that are close in energy on the potential energy surface. Geometries can also be computed by ab initio quantum chemistry methods to high accuracy. The molecular geometry can be different as a solid, in solution, and as a gas.

The position of each atom is determined by the nature of the chemical bonds by which it is connected to its neighboring atoms. The molecular geometry can be described by the positions of these atoms in space, evoking bond lengths of two joined atoms, bond angles of three connected atoms, and torsion angles (dihedral angles) of three consecutive bonds.

== Influence of thermal excitation ==
Since the motions of the atoms in a molecule are determined by quantum mechanics, &quot;motion&quot; must be defined in a quantum mechanical way. The overall (external) quantum mechanical motions translation and rotation hardly change the geometry of the molecule. (To some extent rotation influences the geometry via Coriolis forces and centrifugal distortion, but this is negligible for the present discussion.) In addition to translation and rotation, a third type of motion is molecular vibration, which corresponds to internal motions of the atoms such as bond stretching and bond angle variation. The molecular vibrations are harmonic (at least to good approximation), and the atoms oscillate about their equilibrium positions, even at the absolute zero of temperature. At absolute zero all atoms are in their vibrational ground state and show zero point quantum mechanical motion, so that the wavefunction of a single vibrational mode is not a sharp peak, but approximately a Gaussian function (the wavefunction for &quot;n&quot; = 0 depicted in the article on the quantum harmonic oscillator). At higher temperatures the vibrational modes may be thermally excited (in a classical interpretation one expresses this by stating that &quot;the molecules will vibrate faster&quot;), but they oscillate still around the recognizable geometry of the molecule.

To get a feeling for the probability that the vibration of molecule may be thermally excited,
we inspect the Boltzmann factor , where Δ&quot;E&quot; is the excitation energy of the vibrational mode, &quot;k&quot; the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; the absolute temperature. At 298 K (25 °C), typical values for the Boltzmann factor β are:
* &quot;β&quot; = 0.089 for Δ&quot;E&quot; = 500 cm−1
* &quot;β&quot; = 0.008 for Δ&quot;E&quot; = 1000 cm−1
* &quot;β&quot; = 0.0007 for Δ&quot;E&quot; = 1500 cm−1.
(The reciprocal centimeter is an energy unit that is commonly used in infrared spectroscopy; 1 cm−1 corresponds to ). When an excitation energy is 500 cm−1, then about 8.9 percent of the molecules are thermally excited at room temperature. To put this in perspective: the lowest excitation vibrational energy in water is the bending mode (about 1600 cm−1). Thus, at room temperature less than 0.07 percent of all the molecules of a given amount of water will vibrate faster than at absolute zero.

As stated above, rotation hardly influences the molecular geometry. But, as a quantum mechanical motion, it is thermally excited at relatively (as compared to vibration) low temperatures. From a classical point of view it can be stated that at higher temperatures more molecules will rotate faster,
which implies that they have higher angular velocity and angular momentum. In quantum mechanical language: more eigenstates of higher angular momentum become thermally populated with rising temperatures. Typical rotational excitation energies are on the order of a few cm−1. The results of many spectroscopic experiments are broadened because they involve an averaging over rotational states. It is often difficult to extract geometries from spectra at high temperatures, because the number of rotational states probed in the experimental averaging increases with increasing temperature. Thus, many spectroscopic observations can only be expected to yield reliable molecular geometries at temperatures close to absolute zero, because at higher temperatures too many higher rotational states are thermally populated.

== Bonding ==

Molecules, by definition, are most often held together with covalent bonds involving single, double, and/or triple bonds, where a &quot;bond&quot; is a shared pair of electrons (the other method of bonding between atoms is called ionic bonding and involves a positive cation and a negative anion).

Molecular geometries can be specified in terms of &#x27;bond lengths&#x27;, &#x27;bond angles&#x27; and &#x27;torsional angles&#x27;. The bond length is defined to be the average distance between the nuclei of two atoms bonded together in any given molecule. A bond angle is the angle formed between three atoms across at least two bonds. For four atoms bonded together in a chain, the torsional angle is the angle between the plane formed by the first three atoms and the plane formed by the last three atoms.

There exists a mathematical relationship among the bond angles for one central atom and four peripheral atoms (labeled 1 through 4) expressed by the following determinant. This constraint removes one degree of freedom from the choices of (originally) six free bond angles to leave only five choices of bond angles. (The angles &quot;θ&quot;11, &quot;θ&quot;22, &quot;θ&quot;33, and &quot;θ&quot;44 are always zero and that this relationship can be modified for a different number of peripheral atoms by expanding/contracting the square matrix.)

:formula_1

Molecular geometry is determined by the quantum mechanical behavior of the electrons. Using the valence bond approximation this can be understood by the type of bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule. When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, the atomic orbitals of each atom are said to combine in a process called orbital hybridisation. The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised.

An understanding of the wavelike behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules is the subject of quantum chemistry.

== Isomers ==

Isomers are types of molecules that share a chemical formula but have difference geometries, resulting in different properties:
* A pure substance is composed of only one type of isomer of a molecule (all have the same geometrical structure).
* Structural isomers have the same chemical formula but different physical arrangements, often forming alternate molecular geometries with very different properties. The atoms are not bonded (connected) together in the same orders.
** Functional isomers are special kinds of structural isomers, where certain groups of atoms exhibit a special kind of behavior, such as an ether or an alcohol.
* Stereoisomers may have many similar physicochemical properties (melting point, boiling point) and at the same time very different biochemical activities. This is because they exhibit a handedness that is commonly found in living systems. One manifestation of this chirality or handedness is that they have the ability to rotate polarized light in different directions.
* Protein folding concerns the complex geometries and different isomers that proteins can take.

==Types of molecular structure==
A bond angle is the geometric angle between two adjacent bonds. Some common shapes of simple molecules include:
* Linear: In a linear model, atoms are connected in a straight line. The bond angles are set at 180°. For example, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide have a linear molecular shape.
* Trigonal planar: Molecules with the trigonal planar shape are somewhat triangular and in one plane (flat). Consequently, the bond angles are set at 120°. For example, boron trifluoride.
* Angular: Angular molecules (also called &quot;bent&quot; or &quot;V-shaped&quot;) have a non-linear shape. For example, water (H2O), which has an angle of about 105°. A water molecule has two pairs of bonded electrons and two unshared lone pairs.
* Tetrahedral: &quot;Tetra-&quot; signifies four, and &quot;-hedral&quot; relates to a face of a solid, so &quot;tetrahedral&quot; literally means &quot;having four faces&quot;. This shape is found when there are four bonds all on one central atom, with no extra unshared electron pairs. In accordance with the VSEPR (valence-shell electron pair repulsion theory), the bond angles between the electron bonds are arccos(−) = 109.47°. For example, methane (CH4) is a tetrahedral molecule. 
* Octahedral: &quot;Octa-&quot; signifies eight, and &quot;-hedral&quot; relates to a face of a solid, so &quot;octahedral&quot; means &quot;having eight faces&quot;. The bond angle is 90 degrees. For example, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an octahedral molecule.
* Trigonal pyramidal: A trigonal pyramidal molecule has a pyramid-like shape with a triangular base. Unlike the linear and trigonal planar shapes but similar to the tetrahedral orientation, pyramidal shapes require three dimensions in order to fully separate the electrons. Here, there are only three pairs of bonded electrons, leaving one unshared lone pair. Lone pair – bond pair repulsions change the bond angle from the tetrahedral angle to a slightly lower value. For example, ammonia (NH3).

===VSEPR table===

The bond angles in the table below are ideal angles from the simple VSEPR theory (pronounced &quot;Vesper Theory&quot;), followed by the actual angle for the example given in the following column where this differs. For many cases, such as trigonal pyramidal and bent, the actual angle for the example differs from the ideal angle, and examples differ by different amounts. For example, the angle in H2S (92°) differs from the tetrahedral angle by much more than the angle for H2O (104.48°) does.
The greater the number of lone pairs contained in a molecule, the smaller the angles between the atoms of that molecule. The VSEPR theory predicts that lone pairs repel each other, thus pushing the different atoms away from them.

==3D representations==
* Line or stick – atomic nuclei are not represented, just the bonds as sticks or lines. As in 2D molecular structures of this type, atoms are implied at each vertex.
* Electron density plot – shows the electron density determined either crystallographically or using quantum mechanics rather than distinct atoms or bonds.

* Ball and stick – atomic nuclei are represented by spheres (balls) and the bonds as sticks.
* Spacefilling models or CPK models (also an atomic coloring scheme in representations) – the molecule is represented by overlapping spheres representing the atoms.
* Cartoon – a representation used for proteins where loops, beta sheets, and alpha helices are represented diagrammatically and no atoms or bonds are explicitly represented (e.g. the protein backbone is represented as a smooth pipe).

<doc id="996279" wikidata="Q1532634" url="?curid=996279" title="Ragged Island, Bahamas">
<text>Ragged Island is a island and district in the southern Bahamas. Ragged Island is part of the Jumentos Cays and Ragged Island Chain. The crescent-shaped chain measures over in length and includes cays known as Raccoon Cay, Hog Cay and Double-Breasted Cay. Island ownership is stated to have been granted to William George Lockhart some time in the 18th century. On 8 September 2017, Duncan Town took a direct hit from Hurricane Irma.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the Ragged Islands &quot;Utiaquia&quot;, meaning &quot;western hutia land&quot;. Spanish explorers named the islands &quot;Islas de Arena&quot; (&quot;sand islands&quot;).

==Economy==
Until recently the island had an active salt industry, the salt ponds having been developed in the 19th century by Duncan Taylor, after whom Duncan Town, the only settlement, is named.

Due to the decline of the salt industry, which had peaked in the 1930s, there has been a gradual emigration to more prosperous islands such as New Providence, Grand Bahama Island, Abaco Island, The Exumas and Eleuthera.

==Population and people==
The population of Ragged Island in the 2010 census was 72. Senator Mizpah Tertullien was born on the island in 1930.

===Duncan Town===
Duncan Town is the only settlement in the entire Ragged Island chain and is situated within a bay of shallow water. The island contains a small airstrip, a harbor, and a lighthouse. A tower on the south end of the island is visible from ships transiting the Old Bahama Channel.

Most of the inhabitants on the island are direct descendants of the original settlers and they bear their original family names, such as Moxey, Curling, Lockhart, Maycock, Munroe, Joffre, Wallace, and Wilson. One of the surnames Maycock originated from Maycock Cay. The familiar heritage and their remoteness have resulted in the islands being part of the “family islands” or “out island”. Although the island is remote and sparsely populated, many of its descendants have taken important roles within sailing &amp; maritime affairs, politics, athletics, entertainment, and business.

In September 2017, the prime minister invoked a mandatory evacuation order for all members of the community to leave the island to allow for cleanup and the restoration of services, following a devastating hit by Hurricane Irma. Eighteen residents who had not evacuated before the storm were affected by the request, which included the offer of an airlift to New Providence. The prime minister subsequently offered to consider redevelopment of a more robust community if residents were agreeable.

As of March 2019, there are only limited attempts at restoring the island. In a speech on March 19, the prime minister evaded reporters questions concerning the proposed solar farm for the island. Construction of the solar farm began in December 2019. With the battery storage system finalized, the system is expected to supply at least 90% of the island&#x27;s energy needs. The solar field was essentially completed in early February 2020 and was commissioned by the end of February.

==Communications==
In August 2005, a contract was signed with TYCO International to deploy a fiber-optic submarine cable in a self-healing ring topology, connecting 14 islands of the Bahamas (New Providence, Andros, Eleuthera, Exuma, Long Island, Ragged Island, Inagua, Mayaguana, San Salvador, Rum Cay, Cat Island, Abaco, Crooked Island and Grand Bahama) at a cost of $60 million.

==Transportation==
The island relies on the &quot;mail boat&quot; for transportation to and from the major islands as well as for freight and commerce.

The island is also served by Duncan Town Airport. Upgrades to the Duncan Town Airport (funded by the European Union) were commenced in 2006 at a cost of $650,000.

The dredging and construction of a dock in Ragged Island commenced in 2006 at an estimated cost of some $3.5 million.

== Politics ==
For elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas, Ragged Island is part of the &quot;The Exumas and Ragged Island&quot; constituency.

==Little Ragged Island==
This island of 730 acres is privately owned, and was listed for sale in March 2021 according to CNN.

<doc id="996280" wikidata="Q1206804" url="?curid=996280" title="Devil Hunter Yohko">
<text>is a Japanese original video animation series created by Madhouse, produced by Toho, and released in North America by ADV Films as their first release. The series was first released on December 1, 1990 and ended on July 1, 1995. It is about a sixteen-year-old girl named Yohko Mano, voiced by Aya Hisakawa, who banishes demons from the Earth. 

An English dubbed version of the series was also released. The six-episode series was adapted into several video games by Masaya.

==Plot==
For centuries, the Mano family has been slaying demons. Yohko&#x27;s grandmother, Madoka, is the 107th Devil Hunter, and Yohko&#x27;s mother, Sayoko, would have been the 108th, but for a small hitch: A Devil Hunter must be a virgin to take on the power and responsibility. Sayoko became pregnant before Madoka could reveal the family&#x27;s secrets, and so the job fell to Yohko. Now the 108th Devil Hunter, Yohko must face off against demons while trying to live her life as a boy-crazy schoolgirl.

==Characters==
*Yohko Mano (真野 妖子 &quot;Mano Yōko&quot;): The heroine of the anime. Her grandmother gives Yohko the responsibility to be the 108th Devil Hunter and continue their family&#x27;s legacy of Devil Hunters. She now fights as a Devil Hunter against demons that appear and interrupt her life and ruin her chances of ever getting with the guy of her dreams. In part 1, she was drawn with a lot of detail, giving her a mature look. By part 6, less detail and a younger look were used. In the dub, she speaks with a heavy Valley Girl accent.
*Azusa Kanzaki (神崎 あづさ &quot;Kanzaki Azusa&quot;): A sidekick, or apprentice under Yohko. She is a Devil Hunter in training. Azusa is from a mountain village and came down seeking Yohko to be trained. Although she is not a skilled fighter and can be a klutz, Azusa fights alongside Yohko where she can and continues to learn to become just like her master, Yohko. Azusa wears a Youma bracelet instead of the traditional Youma ring that Yohko possesses and she wields the Spear of Fuma in combat.
*Madoka Mano (真野 マドカ &quot;Mano Madoka&quot;): Grandmother to Yohko Mano and mother of Sayoko Mano, Yohko&#x27;s mother. She was the former 107th Devil Hunter but now is too old to continue being a Devil Hunter, although she still has some skill and fight in her. She passes the title of Devil Hunter to Yohko to continue the family legacy.
*Sayoko Mano (真野 小夜子 &quot;Sayoko Mano&quot;): Daughter of Madoka Mano and mother to Yohko Mano. She was supposed to be the 108th Devil Hunter but became pregnant with Yohko (Only virgins can become Devil Hunters). She had a very frank and open opinion on sex and even gave Yohko a package of condoms in the first episode. This attitude, like most things in the series, was later toned down greatly in subsequent episodes.
*Chikako Ogawa (小川 千賀子 &quot;Ogawa Chikako&quot;): Yohko&#x27;s best friend. Chi (her nickname) seems to have an extensive information gathering network and tends to know about most of the events going on at the school. She usually supplies Yohko with info (sometimes pictures) on the most handsome guys. She employs herself as Yohko&#x27;s &quot;manager&quot; and assist Yohko where she can, although she does tend to get herself caught in the line of fire.

===Secondary characters===
*Osamu Wakabayashi: A friend and admirer of Yohko, he gets used by the demons in the first OVA in an attempt to prevent her from becoming a Devil Hunter.
*Haruka Mano (真野 ハルカ &quot;Mano Haruka&quot;): The first Devil Hunter from the Mano Family. She is very skilled as a Devil Hunter and is able to fend and defeat any demon, even the most powerful of all demons, Yujiro Tasugaru. In several artworks, she is portrayed with a white Devil Hunter outfit with pink hair. In the anime however, she wears a red Devil Hunter outfit and has light green hair.
*Yujiro Tasugaru: The strongest of all demons, Yujiro is one of the first formidable demons and enemy of the Mano Family, being an oni-looking humanoid muscle demon and wearing a monster face on his back. Yujiro is very powerful and has the ability to manipulate time and space. He was responsible for allowing demons to enter the human world and almost brought the world to the brink of hell, until the first Devil Hunter, Haruka Mano, defeated and sealed him. Every generation, Yujiro manages to free himself, only to be beaten and sealed again by that generation&#x27;s Devil Hunter. Not only is he extremely powerful, he is extremely clever and cunning.
*Chiaki Mano: Twin sister of Madoka Mano and Grandmother to Ayako Mano. Chiaki competed against Madoka to see which of the two would hold the title of the 107th Devil Hunter. Chiaki lost to her sister and because of this, she grew bitter of Madoka and left the family house, stealing the Whip of Destruction in the process. She now trains Ayako and Azusa 2 to defeat the 108th Devil Hunter, Yohko Mano, to prove that Ayako is the true 108th Devil Hunter.
*Ayako Mano: Granddaughter of Chiaki Mano and cousin to Yohko Mano. She was trained by Chiaki Mano to defeat Yohko and become the true 108th Devil Hunter. Ayako shares a very similar appearance to Yohko, thus making them look like twins. However, Ayako has lighter hair and her eyes are a bit more narrow than Yohko&#x27;s, and her Devil Hunter uniform is black, not red. She is the wielder of the Whip of Destruction, which she uses at its full potential. Together with Azusa 2, she had planned to take the Devil Hunter title from Yohko and claim it as her own. However, they joined forces to fight a very powerful demon, one Ayako had accidentally released, which temporarily shook her confidence. Afterwards, Ayako decided she needed more training and left to improve herself, parting with her cousin on more amiable terms.
*Azusa 2: Sidekick to Ayako Mano. She looks very much like Azusa Kanzaki. Since she never mentioned her actual name, Madoka dubs her with the name &quot;Azusa 2&quot;. She is very much like Azusa, both in appearance and in skill, which means that she too is a klutz at times and not very skilled in fighting. She does seem to have a bit more experience in combat, although not much of a difference compared to Azusa Kanzaki.

==Release==
&quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot; was ADV Films&#x27; first VHS release, on December 15, 1992. ADV co-founder Matt Greenfield said the reason &quot;Yohko&quot; was chosen as the first release was because &quot;we wanted something that was really very unique, that people were going to say &#x27;Whoa! What was that?&#x27;, because at the time no one in the US had seen anything like this.&quot; Toho reluctantly licensed &quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot; to ADV, making the title ADV&#x27;s first; even though Shozo Watanabe, the general manager of the Los Angeles office of Toho, expressed concern that ADV would not be able to handle the distribution of the film, Toho was unable to find another distributor, so it selected ADV. The story was adapted into a manga by Gaku Miyao. The anime was re-released on DVD in 2002, commemorating the tenth anniversary of its original release by ADV.

Toho released a Blu-ray box set of the OVA series on July 20, 2022.

==Video games==
The series was adapted into several video games by Masaya (a division of NCS Corporation):

* &quot;Mamono Hunter Yōko: Dai 7 no Keishō&quot; (1991) for the Sega Mega Drive.
* &quot;Mamono Hunter Yōko: Makai kara no Tenkōsei&quot; (1992) for the PC Engine.
* &quot;Mamono Hunter Yōko: Tooki Yobigoe&quot; (1993) for the PC Engine.

<doc id="996283" wikidata="Q1050074" url="?curid=996283" title="28 Liberty Street">
<text>28 Liberty Street, formerly known as One Chase Manhattan Plaza, is a 60-story International Style skyscraper between Nassau, Liberty, William, and Pine Streets in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. The building, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), opened in 1961. It is tall.

28 Liberty Street occupies only about 28 percent of its site. It consists of 60 above-ground stories, a ground-level concourse, and five basement levels. The tower is surrounded by a plaza that contains a sunken Japanese rock garden, designed by Isamu Noguchi, to the south. The building&#x27;s design is similar to that of SOM&#x27;s earlier Inland Steel Building in Chicago. It contains a stainless steel facade with black spandrels below the windows. The superstructure contains 40 steel columns, arranged around the perimeter and clustered around the core to maximize usable space. when the tower opened, it accommodated 7,500 employees but contained only 150 private offices.

David Rockefeller, then executive vice president of Chase Manhattan, proposed the tower in the 1950s as a means to keep the newly merged bank (Chase National and the Manhattan Company) in Lower Manhattan while merging its 8,700 employees into one facility. Construction started in early 1957, and the building&#x27;s tower opened in early 1961. The building&#x27;s basements and plaza opened in 1964. Despite some early challenges, One Chase Manhattan Plaza was nearly fully occupied from its opening, with numerous financial and legal tenants. The building was renovated in the early 1990s, and Chase moved its headquarters in 1997. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 2008. Chase Manhattan&#x27;s parent company, JPMorgan Chase, sold the building to Fosun International, a Chinese investment company, in 2013; the building was subsequently renamed 28 Liberty Street.

== Site ==
28 Liberty Street is on the northern half of a city block bounded to the west by Nassau Street, to the north by Liberty Street, to the east by William Street, and to the south by Pine Street. Its plaza is on the southeastern portion of the site, while the southwestern portion is occupied by 20 Pine Street, which had been Chase Manhattan Bank&#x27;s previous headquarters. The tower and the plaza cover in total. The site slopes down to the north so the plaza is at the elevation of Pine Street, while Liberty Street is one story beneath the plaza; there are five basements under the plaza. There are stairs leading down the east side of the plaza to Cedar Street.

Within 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s immediate surroundings are the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building to the north; the Chamber of Commerce Building and Liberty Tower to the northwest; 140 Broadway to the west; and the Equitable Building to the southwest. The public plaza faces Federal Hall National Memorial to the southwest and 40 Wall Street to the south. The building&#x27;s concourse has a direct entrance to the Wall Street station () of the New York City Subway. There are also connections to Wall Street () and to Broad Street () via passageways underground.

=== Previous uses ===

The block was formerly two smaller city blocks, separated by Cedar Street, which ran west to east. The Middle Collegiate Church was built on the northern portion of the lot in 1731. Later becoming the city&#x27;s main Post Office in the mid-19th century, the church building was torn down in 1882. The building site then served as the headquarters of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York starting in 1884. The firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White designed a 38-story building for Mutual Life at 18 Pine Street, which was completed in 1928. The insurance company moved to Broadway in 1950. Mutual Life had expanded into several annexes on Liberty and Cedar Streets, as well as rented space in two buildings on Cedar Street.

Cedar Street was closed in the late 1950s to make way for 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s construction. In exchange for acquiring the block of Cedar Street, Chase agreed to cede on each side of the lot for street-widening, paid the city $100,000, and took responsibility for utilities under the newly closed portion of Cedar Street. The city had rarely closed streets for private commercial development, except when there was &quot;substantial&quot; benefit to the public, such as with Grand Central Depot (later Grand Central Terminal) and the original Pennsylvania Station. Chemical Bank, which purchased the adjacent 20 Pine Street, agreed to carve out an arcade in the entrance area of the building along Pine Street, allowing the entranceway to be set back and widening Chemical&#x27;s section of the Pine Street sidewalk to the same 8 feet agreed to by Chase. The sidewalk therefore runs under the building&#x27;s second floor, withe the building&#x27;s support columns at the edge of the redesigned sidewalk space.

==Architecture==
Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) designed 28 Liberty Street. Four of the firm&#x27;s thirteen general partners were most involved with 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s design, namely Gordon Bunshaft, Edward James Mathews, Nathaniel A. Owings, and J. Walter Severinghaus. Bunshaft, who was tasked with the building&#x27;s general design, passed most of the planning responsibilities to Roy O. Allen and Jacques E. Guiton, since Bunshaft was also involved in several other projects at the time. Three contractors were hired to excavate the foundations, while Turner Construction was hired as the general contractor. Weiskopf &amp; Pickworth was hired as the structural engineer.

The building comprises a 60-story tower atop a base composed of five basement stories and the ground floor on Liberty Street. It has a total height of , making it the third-tallest building in the Financial District upon its completion, after the 40 Wall Street and the 70 Pine Street. In addition, 28 Liberty Street was the first curtain-walled building to be taller than .

=== Form and facade ===

The 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required skyscrapers in New York City to have setbacks as they rose, was designed to prevent new skyscrapers from overwhelming the streets with their sheer bulk. However, these setbacks were not required if the building occupied 25 percent or less of its lot. As a result, 28 Liberty Street was designed as a single slab. While buildings with setbacks had less office space on upper floors, Chase wanted to make the upper floors as desirable to tenants as the lower floors, which led to each floor having the same area. Chase was granted a variance from the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals so that the building actually occupied 27.3 percent of the site; the extra 2.3 percent coverage allowed for an additional on each floor.

The facade is composed of 8,800 plate glass panes, each measuring tall by wide. The glass panes are set within aluminum panels (chosen for their durability and performance) as well as vertical aluminum mullions. The aluminum panels are thick by up to tall and were manufactured by the General Bronze Corporation. The spandrel panels between the windows on each story are made of natural-color aluminum or black porcelain enamel. SOM chose not to use stainless steel because it was too expensive, and it did not use granite because the firm&#x27;s building committee had seen the material as being too traditional.

The building&#x27;s 40 columns, sheathed with aluminum, are about thick and are about apart, arranged in a 4×10 grid. The columns extend from the building on its long sides, while the floors cantilever from the columns on the building&#x27;s short dimensions. The columns carry much of the weight of each floor.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described this as a relatively novel design that had never been used on such a large scale, though the design did have a precedent in Philadelphia&#x27;s Loews Philadelphia Hotel. The presence of the columns at ground level creates a colonnade around the lobby, which is recessed behind the upper floors. The columns rise from steel assemblies measuring square and thick, which are placed some below ground level. In addition, stainless-steel flashing was placed on the facade&#x27;s columns at four-story intervals, as well as beneath the spandrel panels on each floor. This reduced the amount of noise created by the wind passing through the columns. In total, over of steel were used, more than in any other New York City skyscraper at the time except for the Empire State Building and 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

The 11th, 31st, and 51st floors and the third basement level are mechanical floors. Each of the above-ground mechanical floors is a double-height space, with regular windows along the facade on the upper half of each floor and ventilation grates on the lower half.

=== Features ===
==== Interior spaces ====
The building has about of above-ground floor area. Each story measures , with about of area. This made 28 Liberty Street the largest new building in New York City by floor area since the mid-1930s. The innermost two rows of columns were hidden inside the building&#x27;s core, which contained its elevators and service rooms. At the time, it was not possible to completely eliminate the interior columns. Nonetheless, this provided great flexibility for the interior floor plans, which many prospective tenants desired. The floor plan was slightly asymmetrical: the southern side was ten feet wider than the northern side, with columns spaced apart from north to south. This was because Chase officials considered the southern side of the building more desirable to work in.

The lobby, at the same level as the raised plaza, had a footprint slightly smaller than the floors above it and was surrounded by a plate-glass wall. There are numerous revolving doors to the south and west. Originally, there was a mezzanine for the loan offices, which was removed by the 1990s. Inside the lobby are six elevator banks, surrounded by travertine walls. The concourse, directly below the lobby, was accessed from Liberty Street. Chase&#x27;s main branch, beneath 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s plaza, was accessed from the concourse and was lit by an oval recess surrounded by a transparent barrier. Also on the concourse was a meeting room, a foyer, and a messenger&#x27;s room. Passageways in the concourse led to the three surrounding subway stations.

The floors beneath the plaza are much larger, covering the entire lot with a combined area of . There are five basement levels below the concourse. The first basement level was used mainly as a lower lobby and a banking floor. There was also dining and kitchen space on the first and second basements; printing, tabulating, and mechanical spaces on the third basement; check handling on the fourth basement; and vaults on the fifth basement. A truck ramp descends to the second basement; the truck entrance, as well as ventilation grates for air intake and outflow, are on the Liberty Street side, below the raised plaza. There is also a pedestrian entrance on the William Street side, below the plaza, which leads to the eastern part of the concourse. According to &quot;Architectural Forum&quot;, the fifth basement had a &quot;bank vault nearly the size of a football field&quot;, which sorted $35 billion worth of securities (equivalent to $ billion in ) and covered about half the site.

When 28 Liberty Street was completed, Chase occupied about of space. Since most Chase employees worked in open plan offices, there were only 150 private offices for the 7,500 employees who worked in the tower upon its opening. The offices of Chase&#x27;s three highest-ranking executives were on the 17th floor. These executive offices were connected to the lobby and the 60th story by an express elevator that stopped only on these three floors. The interior designers Davis Allen and Ward Bennett were responsible for the furnishings of Chase&#x27;s offices, including much of the furniture and accessories. In addition, a board of curators selected the artwork for the building, and the firm of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv designed the graphics for the building. Bunshaft had planned to place a sculpture on the 60th-story landing but, after realizing that the ornamented spire of 40 Wall Street was visible from that level, he abandoned plans for the sculpture.

==== Mechanical systems and elevators ====
28 Liberty Street was largely built above a layer of quicksand located below street level; the underlying bedrock was below the quicksand. Workers solidified the quicksand by pumping of sodium silicate and of calcium chloride through more than 200 pipes. The excavations for the building&#x27;s foundation reached below ground level. Workers ultimately removed from the site, which at the time was the largest single excavation project in New York City.

Escalators connect the lobby to the concourse directly below it. The building was planned with 42 elevators and 12 escalators. As built, there are 43 elevators in total: three service elevators running from the basements to the lobby; six passenger elevators from the lobby to the basements; and thirty-four passenger elevators from the lobby to the upper floors. The upper-floor elevators ran nonstop from the lobby to serve the upper floors, and were arranged in five &quot;banks&quot;: one elevator bank served the second through 17th floors; three banks each served ten stories between the 17th through 47th floors; and the fifth bank served the 47th through 60th floors.

Air-conditioning units on each mechanical floor weighed a total of , making it &quot;the largest fully air-conditioned building in New York&quot;. There are refrigeration units and steam turbine compressors on the 11th and 31st floors; the equipment on the 11th floor serves all stories below the 21st, while the equipment on the 31st floor serves all stories above the 22nd. An air-conditioning system is embedded in the ceiling of each story. The building was powered by transformer vaults in the first basement and the 51st floor, which in turn drew their power from primary feeders on the second basement. On the roof are a series of fans, which are hidden behind a four-story enclosure with a surrounding parapet.

=== Plaza ===
The plaza, officially known as the David Rockefeller Plaza since 2008, surrounds the tower and is slightly above the adjacent street, enclosed by a parapet. The plaza spans about . Due to the topography of the area, the northern end of the plaza is above ground level, while the southern end is just above ground level. The plaza was unusual in that it was in a locale with extremely high land values &quot;where land was worth up to $10 million an acre []&quot;. Legally, the plaza is private property rather than a privately owned public space. Access from the street to the plaza is relatively limited. Three marble staircases and two ramps connected the sidewalk to the plaza: a wide staircase and ramp from Pine Street to the south, a split staircase and ramp from Nassau and Cedar Streets to the west, and a smaller staircase from William and Cedar Streets to the east. The plaza is ten steps above Pine Street to the south.

Sculptor Isamu Noguchi, a frequent collaborator of Bunshaft&#x27;s, was consulted for the design of the plaza. Original plans in 1956 called for square or rectangular recesses in the plaza, accessed by a spiral staircase, but the final 1957 design called for a circular recess, accessed from the concourse. The recess is about below the plaza and measures across. Noguchi created a sunken Japanese rock garden in the recess, similar to one at Yale University&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, as part of a series of contemporary artworks collected or commissioned by Chase. Seven large dark basalt rocks from Japan were used in the garden, placed atop a surface of 27,000 white granite blocks, each measuring square. Additionally, the garden incorporated three fountains fed by 45 pipes, which drained into a trough that circumscribed the rock garden. Originally, the rock garden had a pool with goldfish; after they died of copper poisoning when people threw pennies into the pool, the goldfish were removed in 1964.

In 1970, Chase commissioned a monumental sculpture entitled &quot;Group of Four Trees&quot; by French artist Jean Dubuffet; it was installed in 1972. The sculpture is made of several fiberglass &quot;leaves&quot; and painted with polyurethane in hues of black and white. At the time, the -tall sculpture was the largest outdoor public artwork in New York City, beating out Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Bust of Sylvette&quot; by . Other features of the plaza include planters and benches.

==History==

Two established banks in Lower Manhattan, the Chase National Bank and the Manhattan Company, merged to create the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1955. Chase had been the largest bank in the U.S. until the early 20th century, and the merger made the Chase Manhattan Bank the second-largest bank in the United States. The combined company was at 20 Pine Street. At the time, the Financial District had languished after many corporations had moved uptown. Few large buildings and structures had been erected in the neighborhood since the 1930s, except for transit infrastructure such as the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and office towers at 99 Church Street and 161 William Street.

===Planning and construction===

==== Initial planning ====
In January 1955, Chase Manhattan president John J. McCloy hired David Rockefeller, patriarch of the Rockefeller family, as the company&#x27;s executive vice president for redevelopment. Rockefeller later recalled that he had persuaded McCloy to employ a &quot;qualified outside firm&quot; to conduct studies on what facilities Chase Manhattan needed. The firm, Ebasco Services Incorporated, conducted numerous studies and determined that the company should buy land for a single headquarters at one of two possible locations: the &quot;Broad Street block&quot; and the &quot;Mutual Life block&quot;. The firm further recommended a &quot;definitive and dramatic&quot; design. Rockefeller worked closely with real estate developer William Zeckendorf, who suggested purchasing the Mutual Life block between Nassau, Liberty, William, and Pine streets. In February 1955, the Chase Manhattan Bank purchased the Mutual Life plot for $4.425 million to construct a new headquarters called One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Chase also obtained from the Guaranty Trust Company on Liberty Street, adjacent to the other lots it had acquired. While Chase Manhattan claimed at the time that it had no plans to construct new headquarters, demolition began in May 1955.

SOM was hired for the project in early 1955. Accounts vary on how SOM was selected: Rockefeller wrote that the firm had been recommended by his friend, the architect Wallace Harrison, though SOM partner Nathaniel Owings claimed that the firm had sought the commission of their own volition. SOM partner Edward Matthews had tasked Owings with the design, and Owings&#x27;s team started preparing designs after meeting informally with Chase executives on June 10, 1955. The team had prepared a survey of the surrounding neighborhood by July 15, at which point Owings proposed combining the two blocks. Although &quot;The New York Times&quot; later said that Owings &quot;claimed credit for the idea of placing a skyscraper on a small part of a downtown lot&quot;, Rockefeller said Zeckendorf was the person responsible for the tower-and-plaza scheme. According to Rockefeller, Zeckendorf had encouraged him to acquire the Mutual Life Insurance Building and the remaining buildings on the two blocks, then convince the city government to close Cedar Street.

Design partner Gordon Bunshaft was in Europe at the time, so Roy O. Allen and Jacques E. Guiton worked on alternative plans. SOM considered three plans for the site: a single building on the block between Cedar and Liberty Streets; two buildings spread out across the two blocks between Pine and Liberty Streets; and a single building on the two blocks, with a plaza abutting it. On September 26, 1955, Guiton presented at least two of the three plans to Chase&#x27;s board of directors. In addition to the tower-and-plaza plan, Guiton presented a &quot;control&quot; plan in which the two blocks were kept separate. Bunshaft assumed responsibility for the design when he returned from Europe on October 15, and he had convinced Chase officials to pursue the tower-and-plaza plan by December 6. This would allow a building with of space. By contrast, if Cedar Street had not been closed, Chase would have been able to construct a tower with to the north; the existing buildings to the south, covering , would have been modernized.

==== Finalization of plans ====
The Chase Manhattan Bank officially publicized its intentions to rebuild the two-block site in November 1955. The planned development was described as part of a little&quot;Rockefeller Center&quot; for Lower Manhattan. The proposed building would allow Chase to consolidate 8,500 employees at nine buildings. The following month, further details of the redevelopment were revealed, including a wider-ranging redevelopment of the Financial District. SOM&#x27;s initial design called for a 50-to-60-story building, surrounded by an open plaza that would be created by closing Cedar Street. The building would occupy 30 percent of the resulting two-block site, and all other structures would be demolished, except for Chase&#x27;s existing building at Nassau and Pine Streets. The Financial District plan also included a 750-unit middle-income housing project on Whitehall Street, a 1,000-spot parking garage on Pearl Street, and a $6.19 million widening of Water Street, promoted by Rockefeller&#x27;s Downtown–Lower Manhattan Association. The wider redevelopment was conceived in conjunction with city planner Robert Moses, mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., and Manhattan borough president Hulan Jack. In particular, Rockefeller said that Moses&#x27;s approval of the project preceded approvals from other entities.

SOM&#x27;s design, influenced by the Seagram Building and the firm&#x27;s Inland Steel Building, was completed in early 1956. SOM submitted blueprints to the New York City Department of Buildings that February. At that point, &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted the project would cost $75 million, which included the plaza&#x27;s cost. The bank&#x27;s board approved $75 million in March 1956 for the construction of the new tower along with a large public plaza. The bank planned to occupy of the building and lease the remaining to outside tenants. Guiton said the bank&#x27;s board applauded the plans when they were approved. Shortly after, the plans were unveiled to the public. A scale model of the building and surrounding structures was displayed at 40 Wall Street&#x27;s banking room during April 1956.

==== Construction ====
Construction on the tower began in late 1956. Before starting work on One Chase Manhattan Plaza, SOM built a one-story mockup with aluminum and stainless steel at Roosevelt Field. Of these, aluminum was used for its cost and appearance, despite both materials performing similarly. A groundbreaking ceremony for the building was held on January 28, 1957, with the first ceremonial scoop of dirt being excavated by Chase Manhattan&#x27;s longest-tenured worker. At the time, the total cost was estimated at $121 million. This cost included $94 million for construction, another $16 million for utilities and land acquisition, and $11 million for furniture. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, as a result of Chase Manhattan Plaza&#x27;s development, planners had created blueprints for $225 million worth of new developments in the Financial District.

Up to 1,800 workers were employed at any given time. Foundation work took place between March 1957 and November 1958. The first of the steel assemblies, upon which each of the 40 structural-steel columns would be placed, was installed within the foundation in September 1958. Afterward, steel work commenced in December 1958. The final piece of steel was installed during a topping out ceremony on September 9, 1959. At that point, the building was planned to be finished in 1960, and the plaza was to be opened in 1962. This was followed by the completion of the curtain wall in March 1960.

Completion was initially anticipated for 1959, but four citywide strikes of construction workers, including an 18-week elevator worker strike, delayed construction. Furthermore, a crane operator died in a June 1958 construction accident. By December 1960, the tower was completed, and Chase Manhattan Bank employees began moving in to the new tower the next month. Chase Manhattan opened a temporary office within the tower while the plaza and basements were under construction. The official opening was held on May 28, 1961; the southern block had not been cleared at the time of the tower&#x27;s opening, and the only progress on that block was a group of nine trees that had been planted on Nassau Street. The plaza was completed in December 1963, and the permanent banking office underneath it opened the next month, after which the temporary office was turned into an auditorium. The plaza&#x27;s official opening was celebrated with a party in May 1964. The structure cost $138 million in total, including the plaza.

===Chase Bank ownership===

==== Late 20th century ====
From the beginning, One Chase Manhattan Plaza had a 99% occupancy rate: the bank was on the lower stories, and 61 companies with a combined 2,500 workers were on the upper stories. The tenants were mainly financial tenants such as EF Hutton and Fuji Bank; law firms like Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore; and a private luncheon club called the Wall Street Club. The building&#x27;s address caused problems for mail delivery persons and the general public. By the early 1970s, though the names of several other buildings in Manhattan ended in the word &quot;Plaza&quot;, One Chase Manhattan Plaza was the only such building that did not have an address designation based on a surrounding street. The &quot;Group of Four Trees&quot; sculpture in the plaza was installed in 1972.

In its early years, the building faced several challenges. The glass panels began blowing away from the building during high winds: during 1962, fifteen glass panels fell from the building due to negative pressure caused by combination of the building&#x27;s design and minute weaknesses in the glass. All of the building&#x27;s 8,800 panels were reinspected, with similarly weakened panels replaced. A fire also took place in the sub-basement in 1962, and an anti-Vietnam War bombing occurred on the 16th floor in 1969, causing minor damage to the 16th floor. A Brink&#x27;s truck in the building&#x27;s underground garage was robbed in 1979 by two armed men driving a stolen fish truck, who took two hostages before transferring over $2 million into the refrigerated truck. The truck was later found abandoned, and the robbers escaped.

In 1990, law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy signed a lease for of space in the tower with options to expand to up to . The next year, Chase embarked on a comprehensive renovation of the building, the first major overhaul since its opening 30 years earlier; the renovations were undertaken by SOM. The bank spent $30 million to clean the building&#x27;s exterior, upgrade elevators, remove asbestos, remodel the lobby, remove the mezzanine, and improve the heating and cooling systems. At the time, numerous large tenants had moved out or were in the process of doing so: law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore had relocated to One Worldwide Plaza in 1990, and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell moved to 450 Lexington Avenue the next year. The renovations were completed by 1994. While Chase moved its headquarters to 270 Park Avenue in 1996, it retained 70% of the space at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.

==== 21st century ====
By March 2008, the tower and the surrounding plaza were being considered for official landmark status. The same month, the public plaza around the tower was renamed for David Rockefeller. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission held hearings to designate One Chase Manhattan Plaza as an official landmark in mid-2008, and officially recognized the building as such on February 10, 2009.

Chase placed a temporary barricade fence around the plaza in September 2011, at the same time the Occupy Wall Street protests were occurring nearby, though Chase did not specify an exact reason. The ostensible reason for the barricades was construction work in the plaza, though observers saw little work within the plaza, leading to numerous lawsuits against the city&#x27;s Department of Buildings and Chase; one such lawsuit alleged that the barriers violated the right to freedom of speech provided under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, although the plaza was a private space. Some advocates lodged complaints with the Landmarks Commission, though the barricades were not under the commission&#x27;s jurisdiction since they were movable barriers. The barricades were dismantled in November 2013.

===Fosun ownership===
In 2013, Steve Witkoff made an unsolicited $650 million offer to purchase the building and convert it into a hotel and condominiums. While JPMorgan rejected the offer, it prompted the firm to begin marketing the building to potential bidders as both an office building or a residential conversion opportunity. The building was placed for sale in August 2013. The auction reportedly initially attracted about a dozen bidders, including Witkoff, Harry Macklowe, Joseph Chetrit, Tishman Speyer, Boston Properties, Starwood Capital Group, RXR Realty, and at least two wealthy Asian investment funds.

On October 18, 2013, JPMorgan sold the building to Fosun, a Chinese investment company, for $725 million, finalizing the sale that December. Fosun rebranded One Chase Manhattan Plaza as 28 Liberty Street in 2015. The new name refers to the building&#x27;s position on Liberty Street and also connects to the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The address number references the fact that 8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture and, according to a Fosun spokesperson, &quot;28 denotes &#x27;double prosperity&#x27;&quot;. Fosun proposed converting the ground and basement stories into a retail complex, and the LPC approved the company&#x27;s plans to add storefronts and entrances to the new complex. Fosun spent $150 million to renovate the lower stories into a retail complex, including a food hall on the ground floor and a , 10-screen Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in the basement.

In the three years after it acquired the building, Fosun leased out of space, bringing the building to 72 percent occupancy. To fund the improvements, Fosun secured an $800 million loan from Deutsche Bank and HSBC in November 2017. In 2018, Danny Meyer opened &quot;Manhatta&quot;, a restaurant and event space taking up the building&#x27;s entire 60th floor. The same year, Fosun placed a partial ownership stake in the building for sale, and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy left their space in the building. Fosun refinanced the building in September 2019 with a $1 billion loan from Deutsche Bank and HSBC. A pickleball court opened at 28 Liberty Street in 2022. This was followed two years later by an indoor soccer field.

== Reception ==
From its announcement, 28 Liberty Street was covered extensively in magazines, newspapers, and journals. In November 1956, architecture critic Douglas Haskell praised the bulky massing of buildings such as 28 Liberty Street, the Seagram Building, and Lever House. He called these buildings &quot;excellent development&quot; in contrast with other structures built as part of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, saying that buildings with &quot;wedding-cake&quot; setbacks were an &quot;abomination&quot;. &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; in 1957 described 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s design as having been influenced by Chase Manhattan directors&#x27; desire for the design &quot;to say &#x27;bank&#x27; in no uncertain terms&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; continuously praised the tower&#x27;s design during 28 Liberty Street&#x27;s construction.

Upon the building&#x27;s completion, Chase Manhattan hired twelve young women to lead visitors through the building and published a special edition of its magazine, &quot;The Chase Manhattan News&quot;. A photograph of the building by Erich Locker, called &quot;The Chase Manhattan Tower at Dawn&quot;, was utilized in many advertisements. &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated that 28 Liberty Street had &quot;the Rockefeller touch&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the tower as &quot;New York’s newest landmark&quot;. &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; described the project as &quot;a milestone, perhaps even an end point in the development of the American skyscraper&quot;, saying that &quot;the big, broad-shouldered Chase stated crisply the mood and abilities of a newer age&quot;. Mayor Wagner called the plaza &quot;an example of New York City’s endless renaissance&quot; upon the plaza&#x27;s opening.

Reviews among architecture critics were more varied. Carol Herselle Krinsky lauded the building&#x27;s massing and the reflective facade, as opposed to &quot;the earlier building surfaces of brick and stone [which] absorb light.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ada Louise Huxtable, writing in 1960, said that 28 Liberty Street, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, and 270 Park Avenue all had a &quot;still too-rare esthetic excellence&quot;. The next month, Huxtable said that the tower and plaza &quot;carry the double promise of corporate efficiency and a more enduring value: significant civic beauty.&quot; Wolf Von Eckardt said in 1962 that the design was &quot;another quiet triumph&quot; for architecture despite being &quot;not sensationally original&quot;. Huxtable&#x27;s successor Paul Goldberger said that the plaza and its &quot;progeny&quot; had failed, but that the tower had a positive impact on the nearby area. William H. Whyte, a sociologist, praised the plaza as among the &quot;great processional spaces&quot; in New York City. As early as 1996, architect Robert A. M. Stern had suggested that 28 Liberty Street was a viable candidate for official landmark status. Eric Nash, writing in 2005, said: &quot;Its big-shouldered parti is monotonous and seems to muscle aside the surrounding delicate stone towers of the 1930s.&quot;

<text>Jamtlandic (Jamtlandic &quot;jamska&quot; ; ) is a language spoken in the Swedish province of Jämtland. In the eastern part of Jämtland the dialects are transitional to those of Ångermanland. The dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity. Some people consider it a language separate from Swedish.

Jamtlandic share many characteristics with Trøndersk — the dialect spoken to the west in Norwegian Trøndelag, and has historically sometimes been considered to be Norwegian in origin. The current view in Scandinavian dialectology, however, is that the Jamtlandic language belongs either in the East or West Scandinavian branch.

==Name==
The local name for the dialects is &quot;jamska&quot;. There is, however, no common term for the dialects in English, and academic sources call them by various names, such as &quot;jamska&quot;, &quot;jämtska&quot;, &quot;Jämtish dialect&quot;, &quot;Jämtlandic dialect&quot;, &quot;Jämtland dialects&quot; or &quot;dialects of Jämtland&quot;.

The endonym &quot;jamska&quot; is technically a definite form; the indefinite form &quot;jaamsk/jamske&quot; is rarely used.

== Characteristics ==
=== Vowel balance ===
Like all other central Scandinavian dialects (Trønder dialects, east Norwegian dialects, Norrland dialects, some Finland Swedish dialects), the most characteristic feature of the Jämtland dialects is vowel balance, an event that caused the vowel endings after heavy syllables to weaken and later even drop entirely in some dialects moving the tone over from ending to the root syllable, example Old Norse &quot;kasta&quot; &gt; (&gt; &quot;to throw&quot;), while the endings after light syllables instead were reinforced, and even caused a type of umlaut or vowel harmony on the root vowel (example Old Norse &quot;lifa&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;to live&quot;). According to one theory, this phenomenon has its roots in influence from the neighbouring Saami languages in medieval times.

=== Prosody ===
The Old Norse phonemic contrast of light and heavy syllables is partly preserved in eastern Jämtland dialects, and to some degree in Western Jämtland dialects and in the Oviken parish in southwestern Jämtland. In eastern Jämtland and in Oviken parish, short stressed syllables are preserved from Old Norse words like &quot;hǫku&quot; &#x27;chin&#x27;, &quot;lifa&quot; &#x27;to live&#x27;, which have evolved to in Fors parish, in Ragunda and Stugun parishes, in Hällesjö parish, and in Oviken parish, while &quot;lifa&quot; has become [læ̂ʋa᷈] or similar in all of the parishes. In western Jämtland, the short syllables are less stable, and are often lengthened to long or half-long in accent 2 words, but is preserved in accent 1 words: Old Norse &quot;svið&quot; &#x27;burned&#x27; has become [sʋɛ̂] in Åre parish, while accent 2 words like Old Norse &quot;lofa&quot; &#x27;to promise&#x27;, &quot;duna&quot; &#x27;to make noise&#x27;, which have evolved to or , and in Undersåker, Kall and Åre parishes.

=== Primary and secondary diphthongs ===
Central- and southwestern Jämtland dialects have preserved the Old Norse primary diphthongs &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;au&quot;, &quot;ey&quot;, usually with pronunciations like , , . In the Offerdal parish in western Jämtland, &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;ey&quot; have monophthongized to and , while &quot;au&quot; is preserved as . Eastern Jämtland dialects (spoken in the parishes Borgvattnet, Ragunda, Fors, Stugun, Håsjö, Hällesjö) have no diphthongs, but have monophthongized &quot;ai&quot; to , &quot;ey&quot; to , and &quot;au&quot; to , , or . Southwestern Jämtland dialects have not only preserved the original diphthongs, but also, similar to Icelandic and some dialects in Norway, diphthongized Old Norse &quot;á&quot; to in Myssjö parish, in Hackås and Oviken parishes, and in Berg and Rätan parishes.

=== Voiceless L ===
The Jämtland dialects, like Icelandic, Faroese, and other northern Scandinavian dialects, have both a voiced and voiceless l-sound. This sound comes from a voiced l that has been partly assimilated by either a preceding &quot;s&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, or a following &quot;t&quot;: Old Norse &quot;kirtilinn&quot; &#x27;gland&#x27; has become , or similar, Old Norse &quot;slíta&quot; &#x27;to struggle, to pull&#x27; has become , or similar, and Old Norse &quot;allt&quot; &#x27;all&#x27; has become or similar.

== Orthography ==
There have been attempts to standardize the orthography of the Jämtland dialects. The attempt that has been the most popular is &quot;Vägledning för stavning av jamska&quot; (1994 and 1995) which is the work of the committee &quot;Akademien för jamska&quot; consisting of Bodil Bergner, Berta Magnusson and Bo Oscarsson. The most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the Bible into the dialect, resulting in the book &quot;Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska&quot;. An excerpt:

Genesis 1:26–27:
:26&quot;Å Gud saa: ’Lätt oss gjära når mänish, nager som e lik oss. Å dom ske rå öve fishn derri havan å över foglan pyne himmela, å öve tamdjura öve heile jola, å öve all de djur som kravl å rör se på jorn.´

:27&quot;Å Gud skapa mänishan å gjool som n avbild ta se själv. Te kær å kviin skapa n dom.&quot;
The book does not fully follow &quot;Vägledning för stavning av jamska&quot;. For example, using &quot;Vägledning för stavning av jamska&quot; one would spell &quot;gjæra&quot; v. &#x27;do; make&#x27;, not &quot;gjära&quot;. Another spelling convention in &quot;Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska&quot; is the use of the digraph &quot;sh&quot;, in e.g. &quot;mänish&quot; n. &#x27;human being&#x27; and &quot;fishn&quot; n. &#x27;the fish&#x27;, with the same pronunciation as English &#x27;sh&#x27; in &#x27;shoe&#x27;. Properly using &quot;Vägledning för stavning av jamska&quot;, this would be spelled &quot;sch&quot;; see § 26 in the external link below.
People writing Jämtland dialects commonly use the letters of the Swedish alphabet, with the addition of æ and ô. The letters c, q, w, x, and z are usually not used.

<text>The Shelby Mustang is a high-performance variant of the Ford Mustang built by Shelby American from 1965 to 1967 and by the Ford Motor Company from 1968 to 1970.

In 2005, Ford revived the Shelby nameplate for a high-performance model of the fifth-generation Ford Mustang.

==1st generation (1965–1970)==

=== 1965–1966 Shelby GT350 ===

The GT 350 made its debut in the &quot;sportsroof&quot; fastback model of the first generation Ford Mustang in 1965. Produced through 1966, these were the smallest and lightest of the GT 350 models. Work started at Shelby American when its Ford-powered AC Ace-based, two-seat, 289 AC Cobra sports car production was wrapping up, and the 427 cu in variant was beginning. Both the AC and the Shelby Mustang use the Cobra emblem, a similar paint scheme, and the optional &quot;Cobra&quot; valve covers installed on many GT350s that were part of a marketing tie-in by Shelby, as well as one of his iconic symbols. All 1965–66 cars had the Windsor HiPo K-Code V8 engine, modified with a large 4-barrel Holley 725 CFM carburetor to produce at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm. Marketing literature referred to this engine as the &quot;Cobra hi-riser&quot; due to its high-rise intake manifold. Beginning as a stock Mustang with a 4-speed manual transmission and 9-inch live rear axle, the cars were shipped to Shelby American, where they received the high-rise manifolds, Tri-Y headers, and were given larger Ford Galaxie rear drum brakes with metallic-linings and Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes.

The 1965 GT350 was built for the race track, not comfort or ease of driving. A total of 34 race-spec &quot;GT350R&quot; cars were built specifically for competition use under SCCA rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years. The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including a rear seat, optional colors, and an optional automatic transmission. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, at the cost of their competitiveness. By 1969 Carroll Shelby was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford, with the 1969 GT350s and GT500s reduced to being largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang.

The 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford&#x27;s San Jose Assembly Plant for modification by Shelby, originally in Venice Beach and later at Los Angeles International Airport. San Jose cars carried an &quot;R&quot; in the Ford VIN denoting that facility. The only year that Shelby Mustangs from the 1960s came from another plant was 1968, where they came from New Jersey, &quot;T&quot; in the VIN, and were modified by A.O. Smith.

====1965 GT350====
All 1965 GT350s were painted in Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built were delivered to the dealer with the optional Le Mans stripes, a pair of broad matching blue stripes that run the length of the entire car from the hood through the roof and the tail. Today, it is difficult to find a GT350 without them.. In subsequent years white stripes were also used with dark colored body paint.

Many early 1965 cars had the battery relocated to the trunk, which was changed mid-year due to complaints of fumes, and had over-rider traction bars, relocated A-arms, as well as other modifications. A 4-speed Borg-Warner T10 manual was the only transmission available. Dual exhausts exited out the sides via glasspack mufflers (with fourteen cars being equipped with rear-exiting exhausts to meet state regulations for sales in certain areas). For this one year, the GT350 also had special -rated Goodyear &quot;Blue Dot&quot; tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 GT350 had a full-size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to qualify as a &quot;sports car&quot; under SCCA regulations), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center &quot;Cragar Shelby&quot; 15-inch rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized &quot;CS&quot;. Total 1965 model year production was 562 units.

====1966 GT350====
For 1966, the GT350 lost its Mustang tag and was marketed simply as the Shelby GT350. The new model year also saw the introduction of non-white colors, including blue, red, green, and black. Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed automatic, as well as an optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later engines were painted regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.

The first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks that had been specifically ordered by Shelby American for conversion into 1966 GT350s; these all had 1965 bodies. They were received in blocks of cars; thus Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order to Ford factory VINs.

As a promotional move, Ford leveraged its role as the major shareholder of Hertz to persuade the rental car giant to purchase 1,003 fastbacks, including two prototypes. Four &quot;experimental&quot; GT350 convertibles were also built for test purposes in anticipation of a 1967-1/2 convertible offering. A small number of the consumer sales 1966 models were factory fitted with Paxton superchargers, but not the No-Spin limited slip differential, for an additional $670, (~$ in ) the engine was rated at . Total production for 1966 was 2,378 units, including two prototypes and four drag cars, with 1,372 sold to the general public.

====1966 Hertz Shelby GT350====
The sales arrangement with Hertz for ~1,000 GT350s to be added to its rental fleet included the proviso that after their rental lives were finished the cars would be returned to Ford, refurbished, and sold to the public as &quot;GT350H&quot; models. Most Hertz cars were black with gold LeMans stripes and rocker panel stripes, although a few were white with blue stripes. The first 85 Hertz cars were available with four-speed manual transmissions and Hertz advertised them as &quot;Rent-a-Racer&quot; cars. During rental, these cars were sometimes used as production class cars at SCCA events, and were rumored to have been returned to Hertz with evidence of roll bars being welded in.
Ford pushed another 800 models on Hertz with black paint, gold stripes and black interior, as well as automatic transmissions.

When the Hertz cars were returned to Ford to be prepared for sale to the public, high-performance racing parts were often &quot;lost&quot; (presumably at the manufacturer) before final sale.

=== 1967-1968 Shelby GT350 / GT500 ===
For 1967, the GT350 carried over the K-Code high performance 289 with a &#x27;COBRA&#x27; aluminum valve cover. The GT500 was added to the lineup, equipped with a Interceptor V8 engine with two 600 CFM Holley four-barrel carburetors mated to a mid-rise aluminum intake manifold.

Documented plans to introduce a convertible mid-production year were shelved due to supply, production and financial problems that happened as soon as the first cars started to arrive at Shelby&#x27;s Los Angeles facility in September. By October 1966, Ford took control of engineering and purchasing. A.O. Smith was tapped to fix the fitting of fiberglass components. In May 1967 the decision was made to terminate the California-based Shelby operation. On August 18, 1967, a small carryover Shelby staff, along with the remaining engineering cars, was sent to Ionia, Michigan; Shelby personnel had substantially less involvement after this time.

Notable cars for 1967 include:
* 0100, the first GT500 built.
* 0131, the only Shelby GT coupe built (&quot;Little Red&#x27;), which was the precursor to the &#x27;68 California Special. The original GT500 &quot;L&#x27;il Red&quot; was rediscovered in a Texas farm field in March 2018
* 0139, the only Shelby GT500 convertible built (in 1967.
Cars 0100, 0131 and 0139 were the first big block Shelby GT cars ordered and built.
* One 1967 Fastback was updated to a GT500 equipped with a 427 FE GT40 racing engine producing , and was known as the &quot;Super Snake&quot; The car was capable of speeds over ; hitting during a demonstration (by Shelby himself) of Goodyear&#x27;s Thunderbolt tires. No cars other than the prototype were built due to limited interest. The car sold at Mecum&#x27;s 2013 Indianapolis auction for $1.3 million.

In 1967 Shelby American built 26 K-code Mustang Coupes to the FIA&#x27;s Group 2 specification. This allowed the cars to race in the SCCA A-Sedan class and the Trans Am series. The 1967 Mustang notchback Group II sedan was Shelby American&#x27;s competition model for 1967. The same rule that allowed the 1965 GT350 to compete in SCCA&#x27;s B Production class - no rear seats - effectively kept the Shelby Mustangs out of the Trans-Am series.

For 1968, the Cobra name was applied to both models, which were marketed as the &quot;Shelby Cobra GT350&quot; and the &quot;Shelby Cobra GT 500&quot;. The solid lifter K-code engine was discontinued by Ford, so Shelby used the hydraulic lifter 230 hp 302. It produced 250 HP with the high rise intake but was not equipped with Shelby headers in order to make room for power steering. The early 1968 GT500 used the Shelby installed 428 Police Interceptor with a single four-barrel carburetor rated at 360 HP.

====1967 Shelby GT350 and 1968 Cobra GT350====


The 1967 redesign made for a heavier Mustang, along with a longer, fiberglass hood, and new front and rear fascias. The design of the original 1965 version was evident, but these styling upgrades gave the car a more aggressive appearance and achieved Carroll Shelby&#x27;s goal of differentiating his car from the Mustang on which it was based. The separate high-beam headlamps in the grille added more character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic &quot;Shelby GT350&quot; logo in place (except for the very early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal sequential taillights (sourced from a &#x27;67 Cougar in 1967 and a &#x27;65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear quarter panels. Ten-spoke, fifteen-inch, cast-aluminum rims were the wheel choice with Goodyear white-lettered radials.

The GT350 was available with air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a 8,000-rpm tachometer were joined along with a smaller analog clock, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure gauges.

The 1967 GT350 came with an iron-block, 289-cubic-inch (4.7-liter) V-8 rated at 306 horsepower and 329 lb-foot of torque. For a pushrod design, the GT350 revved relatively high, with the horsepower peak not in full swing until the 6,000-rpm redline. 1967 was well before modern fuel injection came about, and the car used a single Holley four-barrel carburetor. The true dual-exhaust with H-shaped crossover system came standard with low restriction mufflers and chrome exhaust tips. Power was routed to the ground through a sturdy, four-speed manual transmission with a single, dry-disc clutch. A three-speed automatic was made available as an option. Rear-end ratios were 3.89-to-1 for the four-speed manual and 3.50-to-1 for the automatic. Acceleration was impressive, with a 0-to-60 time of around seven seconds and a top speed of .
Braking duties were handled by 11.3-inch discs up front and drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front suspension consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.

In 1968 the 289ci V8 was replaced with a factory 302 V8 using an aluminum Cobra intake manifold and Holley 600 cfm carb. The 302 had less racing parts than the 289 and was rated at 250 hp. A Paxton Supercharger was available.

====1967 Shelby GT500 and 1968 Cobra GT500====

The 1967 Shelby G.T. 500 was the first model built in the Shelby G.T. 500 range. It is based on the 1967 Mustang and is equipped with a FE Police-Interceptor V8 engine topped with an aluminum mid-rise intake and 2X4-barrel 600 CFM Holley carburetors producing at 5,400 rpm and at 3200 rpm of torque. Two thousand forty eight were produced in 1967.

Several body parts of the G.T. were made of fiberglass including the front-end, hood, rear tail light panel, deck lid, quarter panel extension, and side scoops.

====1968 GT500KR====

Beginning in April 1968, Ford began factory installing a version of the 428 engine known as the Cobra Jet. This new engine featured a unique, 16-bolt exhaust flange. The GT500 was subsequently known as The Cobra GT500 KR. The initials KR stood for &quot;King of the Road.&quot; Ford rated the Cobra jet at , but with of torque at 3,400 rpm, although the horsepower was considered significantly underreported. Shelby&#x27;s KR engine was left stock adding die-cast aluminum valve covers with &quot;Cobra Lemans&quot; to note Ford&#x27;s FE engine family victory over Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966 and 1967.

=== 1969–1970 GT350 / GT500 ===
The GTs lost their Cobra tag for 1969, and once again were marketed simply as the Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT500. The GT350 and GT500 for the 1969 model year received an extensive face lift, the body alone increasing in length by with some reaching . Ford was involved with design and style decisions, with Shelby having little input. The GT350 was now equipped with a 351 cubic-inch V8. Carroll Shelby terminated his agreement with Ford in the summer of 1969. It was designed by John Chun.

No production of 1970 Shelby GT350 and 500 models was undertaken; however, unsold 1969 models were given 1970 vehicle identification numbers under FBI supervision. The 1970 models had two cosmetic changes, a front chin spoiler and two black hood stripes. The rest of the changes had to do with emissions. The GT500 had the carburetor modified and marked &quot;ed&quot; (edited) on tag. The distributor in both the GT 350 and GT500 was changed to a 1970 version. A total of 789 were re-VIN&#x27;d.

=== 1971 Shelby Europa ===
Although production of Shelby GTs in the USA had ceased, a total of nine 1971 &quot;Shelby Europa&quot; GT-350 and GT-500 Mustangs were produced under license by Belgian dealer Claude Dubois for the European market. Seven Fastbacks (Ford used the term Sportsroof) and two convertibles were produced; of which seven were M-code and one H-code cars. One 429SCJ J-code Fastback was produced, though its whereabouts today are unknown. Both convertibles and one fastback were modified to GT-500 with 351-HO. Both convertibles are located in Finland. All 1971 Shelby Europas were based on 1971 Mustang. Previously it was believed that 14 cars were produced, but the total production number of nine cars was confirmed in 2014 by cross-check of Claude Dubois&#x27; files and Ford Factory Mustang production data.

=== 2007–2008 Ford Shelby GT ===

The 4.6 liter, 281-cubic-inch, Ford Shelby GT slotted between the Mustang GT and the Ford Shelby GT500. It is essentially a retail sale version of the Hertz rental-only Ford Shelby GT-H, except a manual transmission is available. The Shelby GT was a unique model in that, just like the Shelby Mustangs of the 60s, the Shelby GT&#x27;s manufacturing was completed at Shelby Automobiles Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada after being shipped directly there by Ford Motor Company. Shelby GT&#x27;s were then sold pre-title to customers. By comparison, GT500 models were manufactured solely by Ford Motor Company in Flat Rock, Michigan.

Production of the Shelby GT began in December 2006 and the car went on sale in January 2007. It was originally planned that a limited number of up to 6,000 cars would be built.

Coinciding with the 45th anniversary of the original 1965 Shelby GT350, Shelby American unveiled an all new GT350 Mustang at the opening night gala of the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, AZ. Presented in concept form, the new GT350 had a supercharged version of the brand new 5.0-liter V8 engine in the 2011 Mustang GT as well as performance upgrades from Ford Racing, Borla, Cragar, Baer and more.

The GT350 was a post-title upgrade available from Shelby. Customers could have their 2011 Mustangs shipped directly to Shelby&#x27;s Las Vegas facility to be converted or they could deliver the car themselves. Automatic transmission was available for conversion with a naturally aspirated engine, producing up to , and manual transmission cars had the option of NA or a supercharged engine fitted with a Ford Racing supercharger to produce , or at the expense of the warranty, , a Ford Racing suspension system (The first 100 cars were fitted with the Eibach suspension carried over from the GT500 Supersnake), Baer brakes in front and optional in rear, Custom Borla exhaust system, 19-inch Cragar wheels, and more.

Performance White with Guardsman Blue racing stripes were the only available color combination for 2011 models. 2012 models were available in other colors, but lost the 45th Anniversary badge of the 2011.

Initial road tests of the GT350 by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; show the 2011 Shelby GT350 is capable of accelerating from 0– in 3.7 seconds, compared to the 412 horsepower 2011 Mustang GT&#x27;s time of 4.4 seconds. It is also faster than the 2011 GT500, which needs 4.2 seconds to get to as well as the Shelby Super Snake with , which takes 4.1 seconds. Weight difference isn&#x27;t a factor to blame for the better performance than the GT500, considering the GT350 is only lighter than the newly lightened GT500.

The GT350&#x27;s quarter mile time is 12 seconds at .

The extensive body kit upgrades included a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced was also included. The 2012 Shelby GT350 delivers the same performance numbers as the 2011 model. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take on a life of its own. An automatic transmission was optional with the naturally aspirated engine. Keeping the powerful engine under control was an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang a reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes were also included in the package.

===2012 Shelby GTS===
The Shelby GTS was unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show, a new model designed to be attainable to the masses.

The hood was made of fiberglass to save weight and the Le Mans stripes added some style. A separate wide body conversion with the option of rear-only or full all-around wide body wheel arches was also available to spice up the exterior of the 2014 Shelby GT. Among other accessories, Shelby GT front fascia, carbon laminated hood louvers, billet upper grille with Ford running pony emblem and &quot;Powered by Ford&quot; badges on the sides completed the exterior package.

Shelby Ford Racing Whipple Supercharger kit in either 525 hp or 624 hp configurations, Shelby cooling system and front splitter. Although Shelby did not independently confirm the performance figures, a 0– of 3.7 seconds and a quarter-mile in an estimated mid 11-second range has been estimated.

The base upgrade package used 20-inch wheels, fitted with BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard suspension bar to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the standard upgrade did not offer much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires did provide improved grip while the suspension brace resulted in better cornering.

Shelby had done a whole lot to improve the dynamics of the Shelby GT/SC starting with an aluminum driveshaft, employed to deliver power to the rear wheels in order to reduce the overall mass. Wilwood brakes — six-pot front and four-piston rear — for added braking performance.

The 20-inch rims on the GT/SC were painted black and were lined with Michelin Pilot Supersport tires. Eibach provided stiffer coil-over springs as well as a sway bar kit to improve handling.

=== 2010-2012 Ford Shelby GT500 ===

====2010====
For the 2010 model year, the Shelby Mustang GT500 was redesigned along with the base Ford Mustang. As with the 2007–09 GT500, the 2010 included unique front and rear fascias, hood with functional vents and unique rear spoiler. The rear spoiler included a functional Gurney flap. Along with new exterior colors, customers had the option of extending the exterior stripes onto the seats. Production was limited to 2000 units.

The 5.4 L engine&#x27;s power output was increased to and of torque with the addition of a cold air intake similar to the 08/09 GT500KR and includes a knock sensor to protect the engine if lower octane fuel is used. The 2010 GT500&#x27;s fuel efficiency increased by 2 miles per gallon.

SVT re-tuned the coupe&#x27;s suspension and worked with Goodyear on 19&quot; tires with new construction, compound and tread pattern. The coupe&#x27;s 19-inch wheels are forged for a reduction in unsprung weight. The convertible retained the 18-inch wheels. The 2010 Shelby Mustang GT500 can accelerate from in 4.19 seconds and has a top speed of . The 2010 GT500 can brake from 60–0 mph in 107.0 ft and has a lateral acceleration of 1.00 G.

====2011 and 2012====
Much like the 2011 V6 and GT Mustangs, the 2011 Shelby GT500 got an engine update with an all-new 5.4 L aluminum engine which was lighter than the previous cast-iron engine and uses Ford-patented plasma-coating technology (Plasma transferred wire arc). The inventors of PTWA received the 2009 IPO National Inventor of the Year award. This technology was initially patented and developed by inventors from Flame-Spray. The technology was subsequently improved upon by Ford and Flamespray. With the engine updates, not only has performance improved to at 6,200 rpm and at 4,500 rpm of torque, but the GT500&#x27;s gas mileage has improved to city and highway, which was enough to eliminate the U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax. The final production number of the 2011 Shelby GT500 by the end of the year was 5100 units.

Ford also improved upon the handling characteristics of the GT500. The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford&#x27;s new Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford&#x27;s AdvanceTrac stability control system, which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied.

External improvements include an optional SVT Performance Package, which includes Goodyear EagleF1 SuperCar G: 2 tires, all-new lightweight 19-inch forged-aluminum wheels in front and 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels at the rear, a 3.73 rear axle ratio, and performance tuned front and rear shocks along with stiffer springs. The package includes a unique rear spoiler Gurney Flap for improved handling, slightly revised front and rear fascias, a new pedal box for improved clutch use, slotted brake dust shields for improved brake cooling, standard HID (high-intensity discharge) headlamps, MyKey programmable vehicle key, integrated spotter mirrors, and fold-down rear headrests. Optional is a glass top roof, previously available, starting in 2009, with the Mustang GT.

The improvements in handling and performance gives the 2011 Shelby GT500 a skidpad rating of 1.0g, and a Virginia International Raceway lap time of 2:58:48, making it as fast as, and sometimes faster than, cars such as the M3, Audi R8 V10, Dodge Viper SRT-10 and Porsche GT3 around this racetrack. Changes to the 2012 model year Shelby GT500 included a new Recaro seat option. The Sterling Gray color was no longer available.

===2011-12 GT500 Super Snake===
Just like the 2011 Shelby GT500, born on the proving grounds of the drag strip and road course at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Shelby American worked with companies like Ford Racing to create an even more aggressive suspension and engine package for the 2011 Super Snake. For the 2011 model year, more power, new anthracite wheels, white stripes and new side scoops are optional.

The 2011 Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake post title package includes:

The Street Legal version produces , while the Track version delivers . The chassis has been strengthened to handle the additional power. The rear end was replaced with a high performance 9-inch unit; the brakes included 6 pistons in front and 4 pistons out back. The driveshaft was a stronger unit while the suspension included new struts, sway bars and bushings. The hood, rear panel and splitter were functional pieces for performance.

===2013-2014 Ford Shelby GT500===
First unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2011, Ford Shelby GT500 was the most powerful Mustang at the time. The DOHC 4 valves per cylinder supercharged and intercooled V8 engine is certified to produce at 6,500 rpm and at 4,000 rpm of torque, with a claimed top speed of . The new GT500 weighs , and was available from May 2012.

The 2013 models had various improvements and differences compared to the GT500 of 2012 including new front end sheet metal along with standard HID headlamps, along with a new LED tail light assembly. The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also had no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes included twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT&#x27;s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec TR-6060 six-speed manual transmission with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach + safely. According to Ford, the changes have resulted in a 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 was a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function was standard, as was a four-mode electronic stability control system.

A Performance package was also offered, adding two-mode adjustable Bilstein dampers and a Torsen limited-slip rear differential. In addition to the Performance package, a Track package for road racing could be ordered bringing a transmission cooler, a nose-mounted differential cooler for the Torsen limited-slip unit, and an air-to-oil engine-oil cooler.

A &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine May 2012 road test provided a 0– acceleration time of 3.5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 11.6 seconds at . By comparison, the &#x27;13 GT500 was faster than both the Camaro ZL1 and Corvette Z06.

Performance claims include a manufacturer&#x27;s claim of ; &quot;Car and Driver&quot;: ).

In February 2012, at the Chicago Auto Show, Shelby officially announced that a convertible version of the 2013 GT500 will reach production. The convertible had a limited top speed of .

No major changes from the previous year 2013 were made for the 2014 model year, however several colors had been discontinued and been made.

===2013-2014 Shelby GT500 Super Snake===
At the Barrett-Jackson auction in 2012, Shelby American announced the release of the GT500 Super Snake. The Super Snake is offered in two supercharged engine packages which have power outputs of and respectively. The first fifty vehicles sold were available in limited edition colors, either in black with a triple gold stripe or white with a triple gold stripe.

The 2013 GT500 Super Snake marked the discontinuation of the Shelby &quot;Alcoa&quot; Super Snake Wheels. New, lightweight forged aluminum wheel were produced and used instead. These wheels were also used on any GT500 (even 2007–2012 models) that entered the Shelby American Facility to be converted into a Super Snake version. The 2013 Super Snake was also offered with a wide body option.

====WELD Edition concept====
The WELD edition Super Snake had new wheels designed specifically and exclusively for Shelby and will be used on the next generations of Shelby Mustangs. This car was in the Weld wheels SEMA show display. The hood of this WELD Super Snake is an all carbon fiber Super Snake hood. It also has carbon fiber trim parts, included side rocker panels, rear diffuser, spoiler and rear fenders. Parts that featured WELD are its vinyl strips and Recaro seats.

====Wide Body Prototype====
This car was the first of the latest generation wide body Super Snakes. CSM13SS0001P was one of the key development vehicles for the wide body program as well as the Super Snake program for 2013. It appeared on both the wide body and many of the Super Snake promotional materials and displays during this time period. It was previously shown at the Detroit Auto Show in 2013 and the New York Auto Show, as well as many other shows and events all over US. It was also in the Shelby Annual publication. This prototype is currently on display in the Shelby Museum.

====Demonstrator Edition of Shelby American====
This demonstrator of Shelby American was used as part of a ride-n-drive to help show drivers the primary difference
between the stock GT500 and the GT500 Super Snake. The conversion includes 850HP, courtesy of a 4.0L Whipple
Supercharger, and comes with the optional Watts link and upgraded interior.

===2013-2014 Shelby 1000 and 1000 S/C===
The 2013 Shelby 1000 was officially unveiled at the New York International Auto Show, under once again a Street Package, and a Track Package (S/C).

The 2013/14 Shelby 1000 had the V8 engine from the 2013/14 GT500. Upgrades included a full Engine Package using a performance 850 hp fuel system with 72 lb injectors, a Borla Custom 3-inch stainless-steel catback exhaust and new parts such as forged pistons, ported cylinder heads, titanium valve springs and titanium retainers. The engine breathes through a Kenne Bell 3.6L Supercharger using a 4.5-inch inlet pipe feeding an 1850cfm throttle body. A High Performance aluminum flywheel and a twin-clutch assembly is also used. The engine is estimated to produce over .

Like the 2012 Shelby 1000, the 2013/14 needed significant under-body and chassis strengthening modifications to handle the extra power from the engine. Driveshaft tunnel braces and billet-aluminium supports and suspension parts were used. A Custom 9&quot; Wavetrac Differential is used to help put power down through the rear wheels.

The Exterior received the usual &quot;Shelby 1000&quot; decals and an overlay package with a functional carbon-fiber hood, front lip spoiler, rear bumper and side skirts. A Widebody Version of the car was also offered.

Since 2011, Shelby 1000 become a package for 2010-14&#x27;s Ford Shelby GT500, due to the popularity of the package, Shelby American also received 2013–14 Ford Shelby GT500s to be converted into Shelby 1000s from customers.

== Ford Performance 3rd generation Shelby GT350 (2015–2020)==

===2015 Ford Shelby GT350===
For 2015, the GT350 has a flat-plane crank V8 engine, known as &quot;Voodoo&quot; producing at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 4,750 rpm. The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the Chevrolet Corvette C7, Porsche 911 S and BMW M4. It has a track-focused chassis tuning, wider front fenders housing 295-width Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, significant aerodynamic changes to include lowering the hood around the engine, active-exhaust, six-piston Brembo brakes with semi-floating rotors, MagneRide damping option (the first MagneRide-equipped Ford), light weight Tremec six speed manual transmission, Recaro seats and various weight reduction efforts. Specifically, it has a carbon fiber reinforced polymer radiator support that directs cooling channels for various components.

The GT350 and GT350R were discontinued after model year 2020.

====GT350R====
At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more track-focused, hardcore and limited production version of the GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, benchmarked against the Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and Porsche 911 GT3. The GT350R retains the GT350&#x27;s 5.2-liter flat plane crank V8 engine, producing the same power, but grip was significantly increased by the means of wider Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, Carbon Revolution carbon fiber wheels (the first ever fitted to a mass-production road car) each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350, and significantly more downforce thanks to a larger splitter and carbon-fiber rear wing to keep the car stuck to the ground. Items like the air conditioning, stereo, trunk floorboard, all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera could be removed from the factory resulting in the GT350R weighing less than the GT350.

Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for US$1,000,000 (~$ in ) with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF.

The GT350R won Road &amp; Track magazine&#x27;s 2016 &quot;Performance Car of the Year&quot; (PCOTY) and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;10 Best Cars&quot; for 2016.

====GT350R-C====
As with previous production-based Mustang race cars, Multimatic Engineering was approached by Ford Performance to develop a complete race-only version of the S550 Shelby GT350R. The resulting competition derivative, the GT350R-C, has safety equipment and roll-over protection homologated to FIA and IMSA specifications; Bosch MS5.0 ECU and ABS controller; MoTeC instrumentation and datalogging; adjustable anti-roll bars; Multimatic DSSV spool-valve dampers and other competition upgrades.

Though delayed until the third race of the 2015 Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, the GT350R-C was competitive right away: having earned pole position for its debut race, the GT350R-C won the next two rounds, and took three wins overall in its debut season.

Success continued into 2016 as privateer team C360R finished behind the sole entry of factory-supported team Multimatic Motorsports for a 1–2 GT350R-C finish in the season-opener at Daytona. The #15 Multimatic Motorsports Shelby GT350R-C driven by Billy Johnson and Scott Maxwell continued on to win 6 out of 10 races as well as the 2016 Team, Driver, and Manufacturers Championships.

===2019 Shelby GT350===
The GT350 was updated for the 2019 model year. The update includes new suspension, aerodynamics, and bespoke Michelin summer tires. The updated rear wing has an optional Gurney flap, helping downforce without adding too much drag. The other aerodynamics update is out front. The GT350 now gets the grille from the GT350R, which has fewer openings, creating less front-end drag. The GT350 also moved to the 5.2L engine block, cylinder head, and valve train from the GT500 to reduce overall costs.

In order to improve corner grip and braking, Ford commissioned a custom set of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that have a model-specific tread pattern and compound. The tires are 295/35R19 front section and 305/35R19 rear section, the same as the previous model. The springs and shocks have been revised — 10 percent softer in the rear and 10 percent firmer in the front. The tuning for the Magneride system, ABS, and electronic power steering system have also been revised. The GT350R also receives the high-tail steering knuckle from the 2020 GT500 as well as a new steering rack.

The 2019 GT350 also gets updated in the interior and exterior. Power adjustable seats with faux-suede inserts are available, along with faux suede inserts on the doors. An optional 12-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen Play sound system is also available as the Tech Packages, which also includes puddle lamps, blind-spot monitoring, and cross-traffic alert The GT350 now comes standard with the 8-inch SYNC 3 touchscreen infotainment and dual-zone climate control. The new colors were also introduced: Velocity Blue and Ford Performance Blue. An exposed carbon fiber dashboard is an available option. The 2019 GT350 went on sale in early 2019.

===2020 Shelby GT350===
The GT350 only had minor updates for the 2020 model year. These upgrades include updated suspension tuning and new colors (Grabber Lime, Twister Orange (replacing Orange Fury), Iconic Silver, Rapid Red (replacing Ruby Red)). The 2020 also introduced a new option, the Heritage Edition Package celebrating 55 years of track focused Mustang Fastbacks, which includes Wimbledon White paint with Guardsman Blue Over-the-Top racing stripes, unique Guardsman Blue sides stripes not available on other GT350s.

===2020 Shelby GT350SE===
To commemorate 55 years since the first Shelby Mustang, Shelby American created Carroll Shelby Signature Edition versions of the 2015-2020 Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT350R.

== Ford Performance 3rd generation Shelby GT500 (2020–2022)==

===2020 Shelby GT500===
The 2020 GT500 was unveiled at the January 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It is powered by a hand-built 5.2-liter &quot;Predator&quot; aluminum-alloy V8 engine with a 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger. The Shelby GT500 produces and of torque. However, it will not arrive to the European market due to the V8 5.2 liter motor being unable to comply with European road regulations, therefore it will only focus on North America and Middle Eastern countries.

The Michelin PS4S tires are upgraded to Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 with the GT500 Carbon Fiber Track Pack.

In September 2021, the GT500 was introduced in the Philippines, featuring the same 5.2 liter supercharged V8 that produces and of torque. It is mated to a seven-speed Tremec-sourced DCT.

===2020-2022 Shelby GT500 Signature Edition===
Shelby American released the signature edition of GT500 with an additional 40 horsepower.

=== 2020-2022 Shelby GT500KR ===

On December 15, 2021, Shelby revealed the GT500KR on social media for their 60th Anniversary. The car is limited to 180 units worldwide.

=== 2020-2022 Shelby GT500 Code Red ===
The first experimental car from Shelby which found its way to production. The car has a high-performance 5.2 L V8 boosted by a twin-turbo system, which contributes to a final output of over with 93-octane fuel and up to while running on ethanol. Shelby will produce 10 cars per year.

==Other variants and replicas==

===Eleanor Mustang===

The Eleanor is a customized Mustang appearing in two movies, Gone in 60 Seconds (1974) and Gone in 60 Seconds (2000). In the 1974 movie, it is a 1971 Ford Mustang that was redressed as 1973 model, while in the 2000 movie it was a custom Dupont Pepper Grey 1967 Mustang Fastback depicted as a Shelby GT500. The 2000 model had a nitrous oxide system.

==Controversies==

===Unique performance===
In 2002, Carroll Shelby partnered with Unique Performance which was reported to have been mismanaged and performed poorly with numerous customer complaints regarding false claims as to specifications and parts, poor workmanship and failure to deliver.

On November 1, 2007, Unique Performance (constructing both Shelby and Chip Foose licensed Mustangs and Camaros) was raided by the Farmers Branch Police Department due to VIN irregularities (cars which have a number of VINs in various locations had VINs removed and moved illegally) and subsequently declared bankruptcy with all assets including numerous body shells and cars in construction auctioned off ending production.

===Denice Halicki and Gone in 60 Seconds===

The 2000 remake of the movie &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; had a custom 1967 Mustang &#x27;Eleanor&#x27;. Carroll Shelby started to produce his own version of Eleanor, but Denice Halicki, widow of the original Eleanor&#x27;s creator, filed suit against Carroll Shelby for infringing on the &quot;Eleanor&quot; trademark and copyrighted image. In 2008, Halicki won her case against Carroll Shelby.
In 2022, the Shelby Estate won a case against Halicki, where it was decided &quot;Eleanor&quot; is not a character deserving of copyright protection.

<text>Duotone (sometimes also known as &quot;Duplex&quot;) is a halftone reproduction of an image using the superimposition of one contrasting color halftone over another color halftone. This is most often used to bring out middle tones and highlights of an image. Traditionally the superimposed contrasting halftone color is black and the most commonly implemented colors are blue, yellow, brown, and red, however there are many varieties of color combinations used.

==Modern use==
Due to recent advances in technology, duotones, tritones, and quadtones can be easily created using image manipulation programs. Duotone color mode in Adobe Photoshop computes the highlights and middle tones of a monochrome (grayscale or black-and-white) image in one color, and allows the user to choose any color as the second color.

==Duograph==
A fake duotone, or duograph, is done by printing a single color with a one-color halftone over it. This process is generally not preferred over a regular duotone, as it loses much of the contrast of the image but it is easier and faster to create.

<doc id="996298" wikidata="Q2982767" url="?curid=996298" title="Exhaust manifold">
<text>In automotive engineering, an exhaust manifold collects the exhaust gases from multiple cylinders into one pipe. The word &quot;manifold&quot; comes from the Old English word &quot;manigfeald&quot; (from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;manig&quot; [many] and &quot;feald&quot; [fold]) and refers to the folding together of multiple inputs and outputs (in contrast, an inlet or intake manifold &quot;supplies&quot; air &quot;to&quot; the cylinders).

Exhaust manifolds are generally simple cast iron or stainless steel units which collect engine exhaust gas from multiple cylinders and deliver it to the exhaust pipe. For many engines, there are aftermarket tubular exhaust manifolds known as headers in American English, as extractor manifolds in British and Australian English, and simply as &quot;tubular manifolds&quot; in British English. These consist of individual exhaust headpipes for each cylinder, which then usually converge into one tube called a collector. Headers that do not have collectors are called zoomie headers.

The most common types of aftermarket headers are made of mild steel or stainless steel tubing for the primary tubes along with flat flanges and possibly a larger diameter collector made of a similar material as the primaries. They may be coated with a ceramic-type finish (sometimes both inside and outside), or painted with a heat-resistant finish, or bare. Chrome plated headers are available but these tend to blue after use. Polished stainless steel will also color (usually a yellow tint), but less than chrome in most cases.

Another form of modification used is to insulate a standard or aftermarket manifold. This decreases the amount of heat given off into the engine bay, therefore reducing the intake manifold temperature. There are a few types of thermal insulation but three are particularly common:
* Ceramic paint is sprayed or brushed onto the manifold and then cured in an oven. These are usually thin, so have little insulatory properties; however, they reduce engine bay heating by lessening the heat output via radiation.
* A ceramic mixture is bonded to the manifold via thermal spraying to give a tough ceramic coating with very good thermal insulation. This is often used on performance production cars and track-only racers.
* Exhaust wrap is wrapped completely around the manifold. Although this is cheap and fairly simple, it can lead to premature degradation of the manifold.

The goal of performance exhaust headers is mainly to decrease flow resistance (back pressure), and to increase the volumetric efficiency of an engine, resulting in a gain in power output. The processes occurring can be explained by the gas laws, specifically the ideal gas law and the combined gas law.

==Exhaust scavenging==
When an engine starts its exhaust stroke, the piston moves up the cylinder bore, decreasing the total chamber volume. When the exhaust valve opens, the high pressure exhaust gas escapes into the exhaust manifold or header, creating an &quot;exhaust pulse&quot; comprising three main parts: 
# The high-pressure &quot;head&quot; is created by the large pressure difference between the exhaust in the combustion chamber and the atmospheric pressure outside of the exhaust system 
# As the exhaust gases equalize between the combustion chamber and the atmosphere, the difference in pressure decreases and the exhaust velocity decreases. This forms the medium-pressure &quot;body&quot; component of the exhaust pulse
# The remaining exhaust gas forms the low-pressure &quot;tail&quot; component. This tail component may initially match ambient atmospheric pressure, but the momentum of the high and medium-pressure components reduces the pressure in the combustion chamber to a lower-than-atmospheric level.

This relatively low pressure helps to extract all the combustion products from the cylinder and induct the intake charge during the overlap period when both intake and exhaust valves are partially open. The effect is known as &quot;scavenging&quot;. Length, cross-sectional area, and shaping of the exhaust ports and pipeworks influences the degree of scavenging effect, and the engine speed range over which scavenging occurs.

The magnitude of the exhaust scavenging effect is a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components of the exhaust pulse. Performance headers work to increase the exhaust velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence of each exhaust pulse, to occur one after the other in succession while still in the exhaust system. The lower pressure tail of an exhaust pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head of the next exhaust pulse, thus increasing the velocity of that exhaust pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where there is more than one exhaust bank, &quot;Y-pipes&quot; and &quot;X-pipes&quot; work on the same principle of using the low pressure component of an exhaust pulse to increase the velocity of the next exhaust pulse.

Great care must be used when selecting the length and diameter of the primary tubes. Tubes that are too large will cause the exhaust gas to expand and slow down, decreasing the scavenging effect. Tubes that are too small will create exhaust flow resistance which the engine must work to expel the exhaust gas from the chamber, reducing power and leaving exhaust in the chamber to dilute the incoming intake charge. Since engines produce more exhaust gas at higher speeds, the header(s) are tuned to a particular engine speed range according to the intended application. Typically, wide primary tubes offer the best gains in power and torque at higher engine speeds, while narrow tubes offer the best gains at lower speeds.

Many headers are also resonance tuned, to utilize the low-pressure reflected wave rarefaction pulse which can help scavenging the combustion chamber during valve overlap. This pulse is created in all exhaust systems each time a change in density occurs, such as when exhaust merges into the collector. For clarification, the rarefaction pulse is the technical term for the same process that was described above in the &quot;head, body, tail&quot; description. By tuning the length of the primary tubes, usually by means of resonance tuning, the rarefaction pulse can be timed to coincide with the exact moment valve overlap occurs. Typically, long primary tubes resonate at a lower engine speed than short primary tubes.

==Why a cross plane V8 needs an H or X exhaust pipe==
Crossplane V8 engines have a left and right bank each containing 4 cylinders. When the engine is running, pistons are firing according to the engine firing order. If a bank has two consecutive piston firings it will create a high pressure area in the exhaust pipe, because two exhaust pulses are moving through it close in time. As the two pulses move in the exhaust pipe they should encounter either an X or H pipe. When they encounter the pipe, part of the pulse diverts into the X-H pipe which lowers the total pressure by a small amount. The reason for this decrease in pressure is that the fluid (liquid, air or gas) will travel along a pipe and when it comes at a crossing the fluid will take the path of least resistance and some will bleed off, thus lowering the pressure slightly. Without an X-H pipe the flow of exhaust would be jerky or inconsistent, and the engine would not run at its highest efficiency. The double exhaust pulse would cause part of the next exhaust pulse in that bank to not exit that cylinder completely and cause either a detonation (because of a lean air-fuel ratio (AFR)), or a misfire due to a rich AFR, depending on how much of the double pulse was left and what the mixture of that pulse was.

==Dynamic exhaust geometry==
Today&#x27;s understanding of exhaust systems and fluid dynamics has given rise to a number of mechanical improvements. One such improvement can be seen in the exhaust ultimate power valve (&quot;EXUP&quot;) fitted to some Yamaha motorcycles. It constantly adjusts the back pressure within the collector of the exhaust system to enhance pressure wave formation as a function of engine speed. This ensures good low to mid-range performance.

At low engine speeds the wave pressure within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, and to increase low-speed torque, large amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal valve within the exhaust—the EXUP valve—at the point where the four primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere, hence the alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, thus inducing the formation of larger amplitude negative reflected expansion waves. This enhances low speed torque up to a speed at which the loss due to increased back pressure outweighs the EXUP tuning effect. At higher speeds the EXUP valve is fully opened and the exhaust is allowed to flow freely.

<text>Walter Spies (15 September 1895 – 19 January 1942) was a Russian-born German primitivist painter, composer, musicologist, and curator. In 1923 he moved to Java, Indonesia. He lived in Yogyakarta and then in Ubud, Bali starting from 1927, when Indonesia was under European colonial rule as the Dutch East Indies.

Spies is often credited with attracting the attention of Western cultural figures to Balinese culture and art in the 1930s, as he became internationally known and hosted numerous anthropologists, actors, artists and other cultural figures. Spies influenced the direction of Balinese art and drama.

After the outbreak of war in Europe, Spies was arrested as a German national and interned by the Dutch authorities as an enemy alien. In 1942 he was among 477 German internees who were deported by the Dutch to Ceylon, but their ship was bombed by Japanese planes. Spies and most of the other prisoners died at sea.

== Life and work ==
Spies was born in 1895 in Moscow to a German diplomat and his wife who were posted there. The family returned to Germany, where he was educated. He had a brother Leo, who became a composer and conductor, and sister Daisy, who became a ballet dancer. He began painting as a young man and was known in Europe for his work by 1923. He also studied music, including that of other cultures.

In 1923 he moved to Java, Indonesia, then known as the Dutch East Indies under colonial control. In 1927 he resettled in Bali.

Mexican artist and anthropologist Miguel Covarrubias lived and researched in Bali in the 1930s with his wife Rose, where they became friends with Spies. He later wrote that Spies left the social disruption of Europe after the Great War and ultimately reached Java. The Sultan of Djokjakarta asked him to organize and lead a Western orchestra. Spies studied their music while living in the court. He visited Bali, under European control as part of the Dutch East Indies, and decided to stay there.

Covarrubias and Spies became very close. Covarrubias wrote about his friend: &quot;The months went by as Rose and I roamed all over the island with Spies, watching strange ceremonies, enjoying their music, listening to fantastic tales, camping in the wilds of West Bali or on the coral reefs of Sanur. Walter loved to collect velvety dragonflies, strange spiders and sea-slugs, not in a naturalist&#x27;s box, but in minutely accurate drawings. For days at a time he would be in his tent drawing them, because once dead, their beautiful colors disappeared. He was temperamental when he went into seclusion to paint, he would work incessantly for months on one of his rare canvases. (...). He also painted dreamlike landscapes in which every branch and every leaf is carefully painted, done with the love of a Persian miniaturist, a Cranach, a Breughel or a Douanier Rousseau&quot;.

The knowledge of every aspect of Balinese culture that Spies provided for Covarrubias&#x27; research was well-acknowledged by the latter. &quot;In his charming devil-may-care way, Spies was familiar with every phase of Balinese life and was the constant source of disinterested information to every archaeologist, anthropologist, musician or artist who has come to Bali. His assistance was given generously and without expecting even the reward of credit&quot;. &quot;Spies was the first to appreciate and record Balinese music, he collected every pattern of Balinese art, contributed to Dutch scientific journals -the Dutch were the colonial power in Bali since 30 years earlier-, he created the Bali Museum of which he was the curator, and built a splendid aquarium&quot;.

In 1937, Spies built what he described as a &quot;mountain hut&quot; at Iseh in Karangasem. Spies was the co-founder of the Pita Maha artists cooperative, through which he shaped the development of modern Balinese art. During the 1930s he hosted many Westerners in Bali, including actors, artists, and writers, and he is believed to have established the image of Bali that many Westerners still have.

After living for nine years at the confluence of two rivers in Campuan (Ubud), Spies retired to Iseh. This mountain retreat was the setting of some of his most beautiful and atmospheric paintings, including &quot;Iseh im Morgenlicht 1938&quot;. Despite saying he wanted to escape from visitors, Spies still received guests at Iseh, including musician Colin McPhee and his wife, anthropologist Jane Belo, Swiss artist Theo Meier and Austrian novelist Vicki Baum. Vicki Baum accredits Spies with providing her the factual historical data and details on Balinese culture which she drew from for her historical fiction novel &quot;Love and Death in Bali&quot; (1937). It was set in the time of the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906).

While homosexuality was traditionally tolerated &quot;as a harmless pastime&quot; in Bali, the Dutch age of consent for homosexuality was 21 at that time, considerably higher than for heterosexual acts. Under the shadow of rising fascism in Europe, in late 1938 &quot;a witch-hunt was started against homosexuality&quot;, with newspapers launching &quot;smear campaigns&quot; against anyone suspected of such inclinations. The colonial authorities decided to enforce the laws as strictly as possible and arrested more than a hundred suspects, leading to a &quot;series of suicides, dismissals, broken marriages and ruined careers&quot;.

In late December 1938, Spies was arrested and charged with sexual acts with a minor (below 21). Though the father of his young friend did not understand why the authorities made such a &quot;fuss&quot;, pointing out that relationship was consensual and Spies &quot;is after all our best friend&quot;, he was convicted to a period in prison, from which he was released on 1 September 1939.

Soon after, however, he was again arrested and interned together with the other German nationals on the island, since World War II had broken out. He and 477 other internees were deported in January 1942 on board of &quot;SS Van Imhoff&quot;, bound for Ceylon. On 19 January 1942 a Japanese bomb hit the ship. Because the crew were ordered not to evacuate the Germans, most of the prisoners on the ship, including Spies, drowned.

==Representation in other media==
*Anthropologist Nigel Barley wrote a novel &quot;Island of Demons&quot; (2009), loosely based on Spies&#x27;s life. Reviewer Tim Hannigan in the &quot;Jakarta Globe&quot; called the book &quot;a highly amusing read&quot;, praising especially the &quot;sparky dialogue&quot; and the &quot;characterizations of the key foreign players&quot;, though suggesting that &quot;the idea that [Spies&#x27;s] relationships with young Balinese men could have been predatory and exploitative should have been given more than the brief touch it receives&quot;.
*In 2009, Spies was portrayed by tenor Timur Bekbosunov in a production directed by Jay Scheib of an opera &quot;A House in Bali&quot; by Evan Ziporyn at Cal Performances and Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s BAM Next Wave Festival in 2010.
*Anuradha Roy&#x27;s novel &quot;All the Lives We Never Lived&quot; (2018) brings together fictional and historical figures in the plot, including Walter Spies. She portrays him as spending time in India in a passage before going to Bali. The novel includes such historical events as Spies&#x27;s two imprisonments and death at sea. Roy portrays the artist sympathetically, based on John Stowell&#x27;s biography and other sources.

<doc id="996303" wikidata="Q1132653" url="?curid=996303" title="Hypernatremia">
<text>Hypernatremia, also spelled hypernatraemia, is a high concentration of sodium in the blood. Early symptoms may include a strong feeling of thirst, weakness, nausea, and loss of appetite. Severe symptoms include confusion, muscle twitching, and bleeding in or around the brain. Normal serum sodium levels are 135–145 mmol/L (135–145 mEq/L). Hypernatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium level of more than 145 mmol/L. Severe symptoms typically only occur when levels are above 160 mmol/L.
Hypernatremia is typically classified by a person&#x27;s fluid status into low volume, normal volume, and high volume. Low volume hypernatremia can occur from sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic medication, or kidney disease. Normal volume hypernatremia can be due to fever, extreme thirst, prolonged increased breath rate, diabetes insipidus, and from lithium among other causes. High volume hypernatremia can be due to hyperaldosteronism, excessive administration of intravenous normal saline or sodium bicarbonate, or rarely from eating too much salt. Low blood protein levels can result in a falsely high sodium measurement. The cause can usually be determined by the history of events. Testing the urine can help if the cause is unclear. The underlying mechanism typically involves too little free water in the body.
If the onset of hypernatremia was over a few hours, then it can be corrected relatively quickly using intravenous normal saline and 5% dextrose in water. Otherwise, correction should occur slowly with, for those unable to drink water, half-normal saline. Hypernatremia due to diabetes insipidus as a result of a brain disorder, may be treated with the medication desmopressin. If the diabetes insipidus is due to kidney problems the medication causing the problem may need to be stopped or the underlying electrolyte disturbance corrected. Hypernatremia affects 0.3–1% of people in hospital. It most often occurs in babies, those with impaired mental status, and the elderly. Hypernatremia is associated with an increased risk of death, but it is unclear if it is the cause.

==Signs and symptoms==
The major symptom is thirst. The most important signs result from brain cell shrinkage and include confusion, muscle twitching or spasms. With severe elevations, seizures and comas may occur.

Severe symptoms are usually due to acute elevation of the plasma sodium concentration to above 157 mmol/L (normal blood levels are generally about 135–145 mmol/L for adults and elderly). Values above 180 mmol/L are associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in adults. However, such high levels of sodium rarely occur without severe coexisting medical conditions. Serum sodium concentrations have ranged from 150 to 228 mmol/L in survivors of acute salt overdosage, while levels of 153–255 mmol/L have been observed in fatalities. Vitreous humor is considered to be a better postmortem specimen than postmortem serum for assessing sodium involvement in a death.

==Cause==
Common causes of hypernatremia include:

===Low volume===
In those with low volume or hypovolemia:
* Inadequate intake of free water associated with total body sodium depletion. Typically in elderly or otherwise disabled patients who are unable to take in water as their thirst dictates and also are sodium depleted. This is the most common cause of hypernatremia.
* Excessive losses of water from the urinary tract – which may be caused by glycosuria, or other osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol) – leads to a combination of sodium and free water losses.
* Water losses associated with extreme sweating.
* Severe watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea results in hypotonic (dilute) watery diarrhea resulting in significant loss of free water and a higher concentration of sodium in the blood; this type of water loss can also be seen with viral gastroenteritis).

===Normal volume===
In those with normal volume or euvolemia:
* Excessive excretion of water from the kidneys caused by diabetes insipidus, which involves either inadequate release of antidiuretic hormone from the pituitary gland, or impaired responsiveness of the kidneys to it.

===High volume===
In those with high volume or hypervolemia:
* Intake of a hypertonic fluid (a fluid with a higher concentration of solutes than the remainder of the body) with restricted free water intake. This is relatively uncommon, though it can occur after a vigorous resuscitation where a patient receives a large volume of a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution. Ingesting seawater also causes hypernatremia because seawater is hypertonic and free water is not available. There are several recorded cases of forced ingestion of concentrated salt solution in exorcism rituals leading to death.
* Mineralcorticoid excess due to a disease state such as Conn&#x27;s syndrome usually does not lead to hypernatremia unless free water intake is restricted.
* Salt poisoning is the most common cause in children. It has also been seen in a number of adults with mental health problems. Too much salt can also occur from drinking seawater or soy sauce.

==Diagnosis==
Hypernatremia is diagnosed when a basic metabolic panel blood test demonstrates a sodium concentration higher than 145 mmol/L.

==Treatment==
The cornerstone of treatment is administration of free water to correct the relative water deficit. Water can be replaced orally or intravenously. Water alone cannot be administered intravenously (because of osmolarity issues leading to rupturing of red blood cells in the bloodstream), but rather can be given intravenously in solution with dextrose (sugar) or saline (salt). However, overly rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially very dangerous. The body (in particular the brain) adapts to the higher sodium concentration. Rapidly lowering the sodium concentration with free water, once this adaptation has occurred, causes water to flow into brain cells and causes them to swell. This can lead to cerebral edema, potentially resulting in seizures, permanent brain damage, or death. Therefore, significant hypernatremia should be treated carefully by a physician or other medical professional with experience in treatment of electrolyte imbalance. Specific treatments such as thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone) in congestive heart failure or corticosteroids in nephropathy also can be used.

<doc id="996305" wikidata="Q1152275" url="?curid=996305" title="Colluvium">
<text>Colluvium (also colluvial material or colluvial soil) is a general name for loose, unconsolidated sediments that have been deposited at the base of hillslopes by either rainwash, sheetwash, slow continuous downslope creep, or a variable combination of these processes. Colluvium is typically composed of a heterogeneous range of rock types and sediments ranging from silt to rock fragments of various sizes. This term is also used to specifically refer to sediment deposited at the base of a hillslope by unconcentrated surface runoff or sheet erosion.

== Location ==
Colluviation refers to the buildup of colluvium at the base of a hillslope. Colluvium is typically loosely consolidated angular material located at the base of a steep hill slope or cliff. Colluvium accumulates as gently sloping aprons or fans, either at the base of or within gullies and hollows within hillslopes. These accumulations of colluvium can be several meters in thickness and often contain buried soils (paleosols), crude bedding, and cut and fill sequences.
== Importance ==

Thick accumulations of colluvium may preserve a rich record of long term paleoclimatic change based on the paleosols and the remains of plants and animals, invertebrate and vertebrates that they often contain. These fossils indicate previous geologic and environmental settings. Thick accumulations of colluvium often contain well-preserved and sometimes deeply buried archaeological deposits as excavated at the Cherokee Sewer Site, Cherokee County, Iowa, and the Koster Site, Greene County, Illinois. Colluvium can also be rocks that have been transported downward from glaciers and so can indicate past stages of cooler and/or wetter weather. Deposits of detrital colluvium can reveal the soil composition and signify processes of chemical weathering.

== Compared to alluvium ==

The definitions of colluvium and alluvium are interdependent and reliant on one another. Distinctions between the two are important in order to properly define the geomorphic processes that have occurred in a specific geological setting. Alluvium is sand, clay, or other similar detrital material deposited by running water. The distinction between colluvium and alluvium relates to the involvement of running water. Alluvium specifically refers to the geomorphic processes involved with flowing water and so alluvium is generally fine-grained clay and silt material that has the capacity to be entrained in water currents and eventually deposited. For these same reasons, alluvium is also generally well sorted material while colluvium is not.

<doc id="996308" wikidata="Q11287473" url="?curid=996308" title="International (New Order album)">
<text>International is a greatest hits album by English band New Order, released on 29 October 2002 by London Records.

==Background==
It was released solely in certain countries—the United Kingdom notably excluded, although imports were available. Available editions include those from France with a limited-edition bonus CD and from the United States with a limited edition bonus DVD.

As it came out in the same year as the 4/5 disc &quot;Retro&quot; compilation, many New Order fans did not purchase &quot;International&quot;, particularly those fans in the countries in which it was never sold.

One new track, the single &quot;Here to Stay&quot; from the &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; soundtrack, was, however, included on &quot;International&quot;, which was not on &quot;Retro&quot;, providing a possible incentive to those fans waiting for &quot;Retro&quot;.

As of April 2006, the album had sold 62,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="996314" wikidata="Q2975856" url="?curid=996314" title="Explorer-class submarine">
<text>The two &quot;Explorer&quot;-class submarines were experimental vessels built for the Royal Navy to test a propulsion system based on the use of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide (high-test peroxide, HTP) and diesel fuel to achieve high underwater endurance and speeds.

Germany had started experimenting with this technology early in the Second World War and developed it into the Walter cycle. They had built some experimental boats. One of these, the Type XVII &quot;U-1407&quot; U-boat submarine, which had been scuttled at the end of the war, was salvaged and eventually recommissioned into the Royal Navy as .

This eventually led to the construction of the two &quot;Explorer&quot;-class experimental submarine boats, which used steam turbines, the steam being generated using heat from the catalysed interaction of HTP and diesel oil. They used the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class hull, modified with retractable superstructure fittings to help streamlining. Being purely experimental craft they had no torpedo tubes or radar fitted, only one periscope and were equipped with backup diesel engines to recharge the batteries and propel them on the surface.

The first, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, was commissioned in March 1958. They were very fast boats, achieving a peak speed of over 30 knots, a speed record at the time for a submarine, a sustained underwater speed of around for period up to 3 hours, and for 15 hours on one turbine. Because of the use of hydrogen peroxide as a hair bleach, the submarines were nicknamed the &quot;Blonde&quot; class. As well as providing experience with this type of technology, they also allowed the Royal Navy to practise against fast moving underwater targets. However the use of HTP was not successful, and there were several explosions, which resulted in the second nickname of &quot;Exploder&quot; being applied to the class and &quot;Explorer&quot; in particular, while &quot;Excalibur&quot; had the nickname &quot;Excruciater&quot;. The subsequent use of HTP to power torpedoes led to the loss of and the loss of the .

When the United States developed a nuclear reactor which could be installed in a submarine, the HTP project was abandoned. It was decided that it was not worth converting the class into normal diesel submarines. As a result, &quot;Explorer&quot; was sold for £13,500 to Thos. W. Ward for breaking up; &quot;Excalibur&quot; in turn was also subsequently sold to Thos. W. Ward.

Other countries have since developed the concept of the non-nuclear air-independent propulsion submarine to the point where it is a safe technology albeit as an auxiliary power source to a conventional diesel-electric drive, although hydrogen peroxide has long been abandoned and liquid oxygen is generally now preferred.

<doc id="996315" wikidata="Q1423776" url="?curid=996315" title="Downhill creep">
<text>Downhill creep, also known as soil creep or commonly just creep, is a type of creep characterized by the slow, downward progression of rock and soil down a low grade slope; it can also refer to slow deformation of such materials as a result of prolonged pressure and stress. Creep may appear to an observer to be continuous, but it really is the sum of numerous minute, discrete movements of slope material caused by the force of gravity. Friction, being the primary force to resist gravity, is produced when one body of material slides past another offering a mechanical resistance between the two which acts to hold objects (or slopes) in place. As slope on a hill increases, the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the slope decreases and results in less friction between the material that could cause the slope to slide.

==Overview==
Water is a very important factor when discussing soil deformation and movement. For instance, a sandcastle will only stand up when it is made with damp sand. The water offers cohesion to the sand which binds the sand particles together. However, pouring water over the sandcastle destroys it. This is because the presence of too much water fills the pores between the grains with water creating a slip plane between the particles and offering no cohesion causing them to slip and slide away. This holds for hillsides and creeps as well. The presence of water may help the hillside stay put and give it cohesion, but in a very wet environment or during or after a large amount of precipitation the pores between the grains can become saturated with water and cause the ground to slide along the slip plane it creates.
Creep can also be caused by the expansion of materials such as clay when they are exposed to water. Clay expands when wet, then contracts after drying. The expansion portion pushes downhill, then the contraction results in consolidation at the new offset.

Objects resting on top of the soil are carried by it as it descends the slope. This can be seen in churchyards, where older headstones are often situated at an angle and several meters away from where they were originally erected.

Vegetation plays a role in slope stability and creep. When a hillside contains much flora their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen unconsolidated material. They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil to help keep the slope stable. However, they do add to the weight of the slope giving gravity that much more of a driving force to act on in pushing the slope downward. In general, though, slopes without vegetation have a greater chance of movement.

Design engineers sometimes need to guard against downhill creep during their planning to prevent building foundations from being undermined. Pilings are planted sufficiently deep into the surface material to guard against this action taking place.

==Modeling regolith diffusion==
For shallow to moderate slopes, diffusional sediment flux is modeled linearly as (Culling, 1960; McKean et al., 1993)

formula_1

where formula_2 is the diffusion constant, and formula_3 is slope. For steep slopes, diffusional sediment flux is more appropriately modeled as a non-linear function of slope

formula_4

where formula_5 is the critical gradient for sliding of dry soil.

On long timescales, diffusive creep in hillslope soils leads to a characteristic rounding of ridges in the landscape.

<doc id="996316" wikidata="Q5461256" url="?curid=996316" title="Florida Central Voter File">
<text>The Florida Central Voter File was an internal list of legally eligible voters used by the US Florida Department of State Division of Elections to monitor the official voter lists maintained by the 67 county governments in the State of Florida between 1998 and January 1, 2006. The exclusion of eligible voters from the file was a central part of the controversy surrounding the US presidential elections in 2000, which hinged on results in Florida. The &#x27;Florida Central Voter File&#x27; was replaced by the Florida Voter Registration System on January 1, 2006, when a new federal law, the Help America Vote Act, came into effect.

==Private involvement==
At the time, Florida was the only state that paid a private company to purge the voter file of ineligible voters, in effect allowing a private company to make the administrative decision of who is not eligible to vote. The State of Florida&#x27;s Division of Elections was required to contract with a private entity to purge its voter file by chapter 98.0975 of the Florida statutes, which had been enacted by the Florida legislature to address voter registration fraud found during the 1997 Miami mayoral election.

Previously, voter purging had been conducted (sometimes controversially) by local elections officials. During the Civil Rights Movement, local election officials in southern states including Florida were the subjects of lawsuits, marches and civil disobedience as African-Americans attempted to register to vote. This led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning discriminatory practices that kept African-Americans off the voter rolls.

The first firm hired in 1998 to purge the voter rolls was Professional Service Inc., which charged $5,700 for the job. Later the same year, the state placed an open request for tenders to bid for the job. The contract was assigned to DBT Online, despite the fact that its bid had the highest price. The state gave the job to DBT for a first-year fee of US$2,317,800; total fees eventually reached US$4 million. The Florida Department of Elections terminated Professional Service Inc.&#x27;s contract in 1999. DBT Online was acquired by ChoicePoint in early 2000 (itself acquired in 2008 by RELX′s LexisNexis Risk Solutions).

==Problems in the cleansing process==
At first, Florida specified only exact matches on names, birthdates and genders to identify voters as felons. However, state records reveal a memo dated March 1999 from Emmett &quot;Bucky&quot; Mitchell, a lawyer for the state elections office who was supervising the felon purge, asking DBT to loosen its criteria for acceptable matches. When DBT representatives warned Mitchell that this would yield a large proportion of false positives (mismatches), Mitchell&#x27;s reply was that it would be up to each county elections supervisor to deal with the problem.

In a February 2001 phone conversation with the BBC&#x27;s London studios, ChoicePoint vice-president James Lee said that the state &quot;wanted there to be more names than were actually verified as being a convicted felon&quot;.

===James Lee&#x27;s testimony===
On 17 April 2001, James Lee testified before the McKinney panel that the state had given DBT the directive to add to the purge list people who matched at least 90% of a last name. DBT objected, knowing that this would produce a huge number of false positives (non-felons). His testimony indicates the state then ordered DBT to shift to an even lower threshold of 80% match and also include name reversals (thus a person named Thomas Clarence could be taken to be the same as Clarence Thomas). Besides this, middle initials were skipped, &quot;Jr.&quot; and &quot;Sr.&quot; suffixes dropped, and some nicknames and aliases were added to puff up the list.

&quot;DBT told state officials&quot;, testified Lee, &quot;that the rules for creating the [purge] list would mean a significant number of people who were not deceased, not registered in more than one county, or not a felon, would be included on the list. DBT made suggestions to reduce the numbers of eligible voters included on the list&quot;. According to Lee, the state&#x27;s response to the company&#x27;s suggestion was &quot;Forget about it&quot;.

&quot;The people who worked on this (for DBT) are very adamant ... they told them what would happen&quot;, said Lee. &quot;The state expected the county supervisors to be the fail-safe.&quot; Lee said his company will never again get involved in cleansing voting rolls. &quot;We are not confident any of the methods used today can guarantee legal voters will not be wrongfully denied the right to vote&quot;, Lee told a group of Atlanta-area black lawmakers in March 2001.

===Errors in the list===
Florida has re-edited its felon list five times since 1998 to correct errors.

The first list DBT Online provided to the Division of Elections in April 2000 contained the names of 181,157 persons. Of these, approximately 65,776 were identified as felons.

In May 2000, DBT discovered that approximately 8,000 names were erroneously placed on the exclusion list, mostly former Texas prisoners who never had been convicted of more than a misdemeanor. Later that month, DBT provided a revised list to the Division of Elections (DOE) containing a total of 173,127 persons. Of those included on the &quot;corrected list&quot;, 57,746 were identified as felons.

Examples:
*Thomas Cooper, Date of Birth September 5, 1973; crime, unknown; conviction date, January 30, 2007
*Johnny Jackson Jr., Date of Birth, 1970; crime, none, mistaken for John Fitzgerald Jackson who was still in his jail cell in Texas
*Wallace McDonald, Date of Birth, 1928; crime, fell asleep on a bus-stop bench in 1959
*Reverend Willie Dixon, convicted in the 1970s at the latest; note, received full executive clemency
*Randall J. Higginbotham, Date of Birth, August 28, 1960; crimes, none, mistaken for Sean David Higginbotham, born June 16, 1971
*Reverend Willy D. Whiting Jr., crime, a speeding ticket from 1990, confused with Willy J. Whiting who have birthdays 2 days apart

===Demographics of the purge list===
According to the &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; (among other issues), though blacks accounted for 88% of those removed from the rolls, they made up only about 11% of Florida&#x27;s voters.

Voter demographics authority David Bositis, a former senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, DC, reviewed The Nation&#x27;s findings and concluded that the purge-and-block program was &quot;a patently obvious technique to discriminate against black voters&quot;. He noted that, based on nationwide conviction rates, African-Americans would account for 46% of the felon group wrongly disfranchised.

==Pre-election cleansing==
At the time of the election, a purge list contained a number of false positives—people identified as felons who were not actually felons.

Skeptical of the list&#x27;s accuracy, elections supervisors in 20 counties (including Palm Beach) ignored it altogether, thereby allowing thousands of felons to vote.

Statewide, a total of 19,398 voters were removed from the rolls. More than 18,600 of these removals matched a felon by name, birthdate, race and gender. More than 6,500 were convicted in counties other than where they voted, suggesting they would not have been found by local officials without the DBT list.

==Details about the errors==
There were many specific problems with the purge list regarding the verification of felons, including over 4,000 blank conviction dates and over 325 conviction dates in the future.

DBT had decided in March 1999 not to include felon lists from South Carolina or Texas, which automatically restore voting rights, but that was overruled by the head of the Florida Office of Executive Clemency, Janet Keels, who ordered inclusion of any felon who did not have a written order of clemency, even from these states, wrongly placing 996 voters on the felon list. Florida did not restore their voting rights until three months after the election.

Additionally, a number of persons listed as felons had been convicted of misdemeanors only, and therefore were eligible by law.

Greg Palast, who has investigated this issue and identified occurrences of these problems, provides a sample of 23 names as they appear on the Florida 2000 felons list, with five examples of these erroneous listings highlighted (this represents a minimum rate of inaccuracy of 22% in this sample). Thomas Cooper, the second one in the list, was listed as being convicted on January 30, 2007.

===Analysis===

Database experts consulted by Greg Palast (including DBT&#x27;s vice-president) told him that, to obtain 85% accuracy or better, one needs at least the following three things: 
* Social Security numbers;
* Address history;
* A check against other databases.

ChoicePoint, in contrast, used virtually no Social Security numbers, did not check address histories, and used no database cross-checking, although it had 1,200 databases that could be employed for the task.

Because some of the source databases used did not list race, the matching criteria did not require a match with the voter&#x27;s race for inclusion in the felon list. However, the decision was also made to enlarge upon this decision, and rule as ineligible the voter in question even if there was an explicit disagreement between the races listed on the source database and the voter list. According to the Palm Beach Post, more than 1,300 registered voters were matched with felons although their races or sexes were different.

&quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; reported that

[C]omputer analysis has found at least 1,100 eligible voters wrongly purged from the rolls before last year&#x27;s election. ... At least 108 law-abiding people were purged from the voter rolls as suspected criminals, only to be cleared after the election. DBT&#x27;s computers had matched these people with felons, though in dozens of cases they did not share the same name, birthdate, gender or race. One Naples man was told he couldn&#x27;t vote because he was linked with a felon still serving time in a Moore Haven prison. Florida officials cut from the rolls 996 people convicted of crimes in other states, though they should have been allowed to vote. Before the election, state officials said felons could vote only if they had written clemency orders, although most other states automatically restore voting rights to felons when they complete their sentences. ... Records used to create the felon list were sometimes wrong. A state database of felons wrongly included dozens of people whose crimes were reduced to misdemeanors. Furthermore, clemency records were incomplete.

Additionally, there are other accuracy problems with the list. For example, Linda Howell, Madison County supervisor of elections, who is not a convicted felon and was never on the felon list provided by the Division of Elections or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, erroneously received a form letter referencing a prior felony conviction from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement stating.

==Election law violations, allegations, lawsuits==
The problems with the list, the process by which it was manufactured and deployed, and other issues related to the 2000 election controversy in Florida, triggered much criticism and allegations of fraud, which resulted in investigations, litigation, and reform measures.

Phyllis Hampton, general counsel of the Florida Election Commission, testified that her office could investigate the wrongful removal of a Floridian from the voter rolls if there was evidence of a willful violation.

On February 17, 2001, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, in collaboration with Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute, launched the Equal Voting Rights Project.

In June 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report and statements arguing that Florida was, on numerous counts, in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, recommending:
*On 1 count that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice should immediately initiate the litigation process against the governor, secretary of state, director of the Division of Elections, specific supervisors of elections, and other state and local officials responsible for the execution of election laws, practices, and procedures ...&quot;
*On 1 count that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice should initiate the litigation process against the governor ...&quot;
*On 1 count that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice should initiate the litigation process against the secretary of State ...&quot;
*On 12 counts that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division in the Office of the Florida Attorney General should initiate the litigation process against state election officials ...&quot;
* ... And so on, totaling 20 recommendations involving the phrase &quot;should initiate the litigation process&quot; or &quot;should immediately initiate the litigation process&quot;

In February 2002, the NAACP and four other groups filed suit against Harris (NAACP v. Harris), the county elections supervisor and a former state election chief. The lawsuit cites the state, several counties and the contractor over procedures for voter registration, voter lists and balloting. The suit charges that Black voters were disenfranchised during the 2000 presidential election, and argued that Florida was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the US Constitution&#x27;s 14th Amendment. The parties reached a settlement wherein ChoicePoint will reprocess the voter file on the plaintiffs&#x27; terms and donate $75,000 to the NAACP.

In August 2002, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a briefing summary regarding the progress of voting rights in Florida.

<text>Fetal position (British English: also foetal) is the positioning of the body of a prenatal fetus as it develops. In this position, the back is curved, the head is bowed, and the limbs are bent and drawn up to the torso. A compact position is typical for fetuses. Many newborn mammals, especially rodents, remain in a fetal position well after birth.

This type of compact position is used in the medical profession to minimize injury to the neck and chest. 

Some people assume a fetal position when sleeping, especially when the body becomes cold. In some cultures bodies have been buried in fetal position.

Sometimes, when a person has suffered extreme physical or psychological trauma (including massive stress), they will assume a similar compact position in which the back is curved forward, the legs are brought up as tightly against the abdomen as possible, the head is bowed as close to the abdomen as possible, and the arms are wrapped around the head to prevent further trauma.

This type of position has been observed in drug addicts, who enter the position when experiencing withdrawal. Sufferers of anxiety are also known to assume the same type of position during panic attacks.

Assuming this type of position and playing dead is often recommended as a strategy to end a bear attack.

<text>Lavender is a light shade of purple or violet. It applies particularly to the color of the flower of the same name. The web color called lavender is displayed adjacent—it matches the color of the palest part of the flower; however, the more saturated color shown as &quot;floral lavender&quot; more closely matches the average color of the lavender flower as shown in the picture and is the tone of lavender historically and traditionally considered &quot;lavender&quot; by average people as opposed to website designers. The color lavender might be described as a &quot;medium purple&quot;, a &quot;pale bluish purple&quot;, or a &quot;light pinkish-purple&quot;. The term &quot;lavender&quot; may be used in general to apply to a wide range of pale, light, or grayish-purples, but only on the blue side; lilac is pale purple on the pink side. In paints, the color lavender is made by mixing purple and white paint.

==Historical development of the concept of the color==
The first recorded use of the word &quot;lavender&quot; as a color term in English was in 1705.

Originally, the name &quot;lavender&quot; only applied to flowers. By 1930, the book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; identified three major shades of lavender—&quot;[floral] lavender&quot;, &quot;lavender gray&quot;, and &quot;lavender blue&quot;, and in addition a fourth shade of lavender called &quot;old lavender&quot; (a darker lavender gray) (all four of these shades of lavender are shown below). By 1955, the publication of the ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (a color dictionary used by stamp collectors to identify the colors of stamps), now on the Internet, listed dozens of different shades of lavender. Today, although the color floral lavender (the color of the flower of the lavender plant) remains the standard for lavender, just as there are many shades of pink (light red, light rose, and light magenta colors), there are many shades of lavender (some light magenta, some light purple, [mostly] light violet [as well as some grayish-violet], and some light indigo colors).

==Variations==
===Lavender blush===

Displayed at right is the web color lavender blush. It is a pale pinkish tone of lavender.
===Lavender mist (web color lavender)===

The color designated as the web color lavender is a very pale tint of lavender that in other (artistic) contexts may be described as lavender mist.
===Languid lavender===

Displayed at right is the color languid lavender. The source of this color is the &quot;Plochere Color System&quot;, a color system formulated in 1948 that is widely used by interior designers.
===Lavender gray===

The historical name for this color is lavender gray. It is listed in &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; as one of the three major variations of lavender in 1930 along with &quot;lavender blue&quot; (shown below) and [floral] &quot;lavender&quot; (also shown below). (This book also designates a fourth shade of lavender, called &quot;old lavender&quot;, also shown below). This color is similar to Prismacolor colored pencil PC 1026, &quot;Greyed Lavender&quot;.
===Soap===

The color soap is displayed at right. &quot;Soap&quot; is a color formulated by Crayola in 1994 as one of the colors in its Magic Scent specialty box of colors.

This color is a representation of soap scented with lavender, one of the most popular scents for soap.
===Pale lavender===

At right is displayed the pale tint of lavender shown as &quot;lavender&quot; in sample 209 in the ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names.
===Lavender blue===


Lavender blue was listed in &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; as one of the three major variations of lavender in 1930 along with &quot;lavender gray&quot; (shown above) and [floral] &quot;lavender&quot; (shown below). It is identified as being the same color as periwinkle. The first use of the term &quot;lavender blue&quot; as a color term was in 1926.
===Light lavender (wisteria)===
The color wisteria is displayed at right. &quot;Wisteria&quot;, a &quot;light medium violet&quot; color is equivalent to light lavender.

The Prismacolor colored pencil PC 956, which used to be called &quot;light violet&quot; and is now called &quot;lilac&quot; (the actual color of the colored pencil is equivalent to wisteria rather than lilac) is this color.

Wisteria in this exact shade is one of the Crayola crayon colors on the list of Crayola crayon colors. It was formulated as a Crayola color in 1993. The first recorded use of &quot;wisteria&quot; as a color name in English was in 1892.
===Pink lavender===
The color pink lavender is displayed at right.

The source of this color is the &quot;Pantone Textile Paper eXtended (TPX)&quot; color list, color #14-3207 TPX—Pink Lavender.
===Lavender pink===

After the introduction of the Munsell color system, in which purple, described as equivalent to red-violet, is described as one of the five psychological primary colors along with red, yellow, green, and blue, some people began to think of lavender as being somewhat more pinkish color. 
This color can be described as lavender pink or &quot;pale pinkish-purple&quot; when purple is defined as equivalent to &quot;red-violet&quot; as artists do.

This tone of lavender, displayed at right, is the color designated as &quot;lavender&quot; (color #74) in the list of Crayola crayon colors. This version of &quot;lavender&quot; is a lot pinker than the other shades of lavender shown here.

===Medium lavender magenta (web color plum)===
At right is displayed the color medium lavender magenta which is equivalent to the web color version of plum (&quot;pale plum&quot;).

This color may be regarded both as a tone of lavender since it is a light color between rose and blue and as a light medium tone of magenta because its red and blue values are equal (the color signature of a tone of magenta for computer display).
===Heliotrope===

The color heliotrope is shown at right. Another name for this color is &quot;psychedelic lavender&quot; because this color was a popular color often used in the hippie psychedelic poster art of the late 1960s for the Fillmore Auditorium and the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. These posters were sold in the head shops of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and were drawn and produced by such artists as Wes Wilson, Stanley Mouse, Rick Griffin, and Victor Moscoso.

===Lavender (floral)===

At right is displayed the color Lavender (floral). This color matches the color shown as &quot;lavender&quot; (viewed under a full-spectrum fluorescent lamp) in the 1930 book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; (reference below), the world standard for color names before the introduction of computers. This color may also be called floral lavender. It is a &quot;medium violet&quot;.

This tone of lavender would be the approximate color resulting from a mix of 50% violet paint and 50% white paint.

This tone of lavender may be regarded as actual lavender and the other tones displayed in this article can be regarded as all variations on this shade.

This lavender also closely matches the color given as &quot;lavender&quot; in a basic purple .
===Amethyst===


The color amethyst is a moderate, transparent violet. Its name is derived from the stone amethyst, a form of quartz. Amethyst is the birthstone for those born in February.

The first recorded use of &quot;amethyst&quot; as a color name in English was in 1572.

Though the color of natural amethyst varies from purple to yellow, the amethyst color referred to here is the moderate purple color most commonly associated with amethyst stones. There is disagreement as to the cause of the purple color of the amethyst stone. Some believe that the color is due to the presence of manganese, while others have suggested that the amethyst color could be from ferric thiocyanate or sulfur found in amethyst stones.
===Deep lavender (web color medium purple)===
Displayed at right is the web color medium purple which is equivalent to &quot;deep medium violet&quot; or deep lavender.
===Lavender purple (purple mountain majesty)===

Displayed at right is the color purple mountain majesty, a Crayola color since 1993. This color may be regarded as a &quot;medium lavender gray&quot;.

This color was the color called &quot;lavender&quot; in Crayola crayons before 1958, when Crayola switched to calling the color shown above as &quot;lavender pink&quot; as being &quot;lavender&quot;. See the website &quot;Lost Crayola Crayon Colors&quot;. Because of that, another name for this color is lavender purple.

This color is a representation of the way mountains look when they are far away.
===English lavender===
Displayed at right is the color English lavender.

&quot;English lavender&quot; is a medium light tone of grayish pinkish lavender.

The source of this color is the &quot;Pantone Textile Paper eXtended (TPX)&quot; color list, color #17-3617 TPX—English Lavender.
===Twilight lavender===

The color twilight lavender is displayed at right. &quot;Twilight lavender&quot; is a color formulated by Crayola in 1990 as one of the colors in its Silver Swirls specialty box of metallic colors.

Although this is supposed to be a &quot;metallic&quot; color, there is no mechanism for displaying metallic colors on a computer.

===Old lavender===

The dark lavender gray color displayed at right is called old lavender. It is a &quot;dark grayish-violet&quot;.

The first recorded use of &quot;old lavender&quot; as a color name in English was in the year 1924.
==In culture==
===Fashion===

* In the formal rules of mourning dress in Georgian, Victorian, and Edwardian Britain, lavender was one of the few colors generally considered acceptable for women&#x27;s clothing during the period of half-mourning, during which the bereaved was considered to still be in mourning and required to dress in sober, muted tones, but was not expected to wear the all-black garments of full mourning.
* Lavender roses are symbolic of &quot;love at first sight&quot;.
* In 1995 actress Uma Thurman wore a notable lavender colored dress by Prada to the Academy Award ceremonies, where she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

===LGBTQ===
* Lavender is a color that can represent the LGBTQ community.
* Just as in the 1890s mauve symbolized homosexuality, the tone of lavender described above as &quot;[true] lavender&quot; or &quot;floral lavender&quot; became the symbol of homosexuality in the 1950s and 1960s. The gay anthem &quot;Das lila Lied&quot; was released in 1920 with the line &quot;we only love lavender night...&quot;. In 1923, Harold Hersey wrote a tongue-in-cheek poem called &quot;The Lavender Cowboy&quot; about an unmanly cowboy with &quot;only two hairs on his chest&quot;. Seán O&#x27;Casey wrote in 1928, &quot;I am very sorry... that I have hurt the refined sentimentalities of C. W. Allen by neglecting to use the lavender... language of the 18th and 19th centuries.&quot; Cole Porter&#x27;s 1929 song &quot;I&#x27;m a Gigolo&quot; went: &quot;I&#x27;m a famous gigolo, And of lavender, my nature&#x27;s got just a dash in it.&quot; A 1935 dictionary of slang reported &quot;streak of lavender,&quot; meant an effeminate man or a sissy, a term used in 1926 by Carl Sandburg to describe young Abraham Lincoln. In the 1960s, homophiles were sometimes referred to as the &quot;lavender boys&quot; (this term is still used by some people (both gay and non-gay) to refer to gays). A &quot;lavender convention&quot; is a convention of homosexuals. A heterosexual who has some homosexual tendencies is described as someone with a &quot;dash of lavender&quot;. In the 1970s pink became more often associated with homosexuality because of the use of the pink triangle as a symbol of gay liberation. However, gays of the baby boom generation still think of lavender as the gayest color. According to some sources, the reason lavender symbolizes homosexuality is because it is the color that is obtained when pink (the color symbolizing girls) is mixed with baby blue (the color symbolizing boys).
* Lavender roses are sometimes given by LGBT people to each other on Valentine&#x27;s Day or may be given to those entering into a same-sex marriage.
* A lavender marriage is a marriage between a man and a woman in which one, or both, parties are, or are assumed to be, homosexual. Usually, but not always, both parties are assumed to be complicit in a public deception to hide their homosexuality (although in some lavender marriages, the marriage partners may be bisexual).
* In the bandana code of the gay leather subculture, wearing a lavender bandana symbolizes that the wearer has a fetish for dressing in drag.
* &quot;Lavender&quot; is the name of an LGBT magazine in Minnesota.
* The Lavender Dragon Society was a club for gay Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
* The Lavender Families Resource Network, formerly known as the Mothers&#x27; National Defense Fund, was a Seattle-based organization started in 1974 with the aim to provide lesbian and bisexual women with resources and information relating to child-rearing, custody and adoption issues, and donor insemination.
* Lavender Graduation is an event that occurs annually at many colleges and universities where LGBT students get their own graduation ceremony to celebrate their identities and achievements.
* The study of language used specifically by LGBT speakers is known as lavender linguistics.
* The LGBTQIA caucus of the Green Party of the United States is the Lavender Greens.
* The lavender scare refers to the fear and persecution of homosexuals in the 1950s in the United States, which paralleled the anti-communist campaign known as McCarthyism.
* &quot;Lavender&quot; is the name of a 2019 American short LGBT romantic drama film directed by Matthew Puccini.
* A synonym used for the original &quot;gay liberation&quot; movement which began in 1969 is referring to the movement as the &quot;lavender revolution&quot;.
* During the 1960s feminism movement, lesbians were rejected by the then head of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, calling them the &quot;Lavender Menace&quot;. These lesbian radical feminists adopted the name for their own informal group, consisting of many members of the Gay Liberation Front.
* The Lavender Panthers was a gay rights activist group in San Francisco during the early 1970s, led by the Reverend Ray Broshears.
* Lavender Country was an American country music band whose 1973 self-titled album was made up entirely of gay-themed songs.

* &quot;Lavender Haze&quot; is a song by Taylor Swift on the 2022 album &quot;Midnights&quot;.

===Religion===

* In Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings (a group of religions based on Theosophy), since the color violet represents the deity St. Germain, and lavender is simply a light tone of violet, lavender as well as violet objects may be placed on the altar to St. Germain.
* The Christian holiday of Easter is represented by lavender and yellow because the crocus flower, which is lavender and yellow, blooms in Europe in the spring.

===Film, television and video games===

<text>The Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary (Soeurs des Saints Noms de Jésus et de Marie) is a teaching religious institute founded at Longueuil, Québec, Canada, in 1843 by Blessed Mother Marie Rose Durocher for the Christian education of young girls.

Their motto is: &quot;Jésus et Marie, Ma Force et Ma Gloire&quot; (&quot;Jesus and Mary, my strength and my glory&quot;).

Since 1843, the SNJM&#x27;s mission to educate young girls has extended beyond Québec into other Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Manitoba. Their mission of education also continues internationally, in the United States, Lesotho, and South America.

Within the United States, the sisters have established ministries in California, Oregon, Florida, Mississippi, New York, the Mid-Atlantic states and Washington among other states.

<doc id="996341" wikidata="Q9064829" url="?curid=996341" title="Spindle checkpoint">
<text>The spindle checkpoint, also known as the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the metaphase checkpoint, or the mitotic checkpoint, is a cell cycle checkpoint during metaphase of mitosis or meiosis that prevents the separation of the duplicated chromosomes (anaphase) until each chromosome is properly attached to the spindle. To achieve proper segregation, the two kinetochores on the sister chromatids must be attached to opposite spindle poles (bipolar orientation). Only this pattern of attachment will ensure that each daughter cell receives one copy of the chromosome. The defining biochemical feature of this checkpoint is the stimulation of the anaphase-promoting complex by M-phase cyclin-CDK complexes, which in turn causes the proteolytic destruction of cyclins and proteins that hold the sister chromatids together.

== Overview and importance ==

The beginning of metaphase is characterized by the connection of the microtubules to the kinetochores of the chromosomes, as well as the alignment of the chromosomes in the middle of the cell. Each chromatid has its own kinetochore, and all of the microtubules that are bound to kinetochores of sister chromatids radiate from opposite poles of the cell. These microtubules exert a pulling force on the chromosomes towards the opposite ends of the cells, while the cohesion between the sister chromatids opposes this force.

At the metaphase to anaphase transition, this cohesion between sister chromatids is dissolved, and the separated chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell by the spindle microtubules. The chromatids are further separated by the physical movement of the spindle poles themselves. Premature dissociation of the chromatids can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in the daughter cells. Thus, the job of the spindle checkpoint is to prevent this transition into anaphase until the chromosomes are properly attached, before the sister chromatids separate.

In order to preserve the cell&#x27;s identity and proper function, it is necessary to maintain the appropriate number of chromosomes after each cell division. An error in generating daughter cells with fewer or greater number of chromosomes than expected (a situation termed aneuploidy), may lead in best case to cell death, or alternatively it may generate catastrophic phenotypic results. Examples include:
* In cancer cells, aneuploidy is a frequent event, indicating that these cells present a defect in the machinery involved in chromosome segregation, as well as in the mechanism ensuring that segregation is correctly performed.
* In humans, Down syndrome appears in children carrying in their cells one extra copy of chromosome 21, as a result of a defect in chromosome segregation during meiosis in one of the progenitors. This defect will generate a gamete (spermatozoide or oocyte) with an extra chromosome 21. After fertilisation, this gamete will generate an embryo with three copies of chromosome 21.

== Discovery of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ==

Zirkle (in 1970) was one of the first researchers to observe that, when just one chromosome is retarded to arrive at the metaphase plate, anaphase onset is postponed until some minutes after its arrival. This observation, together with similar ones, suggested that a control mechanism exists at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using drugs such as nocodazole and colchicine, the mitotic spindle disassembles and the cell cycle is blocked at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using these drugs (see the review from Rieder and Palazzo in 1992), the putative control mechanism was named Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This regulatory mechanism has been intensively studied since.

Using different types of genetic studies, it has been established that diverse kinds of defects are able to activate the SAC: spindle depolymerization, the presence of dicentric chromosomes (with two centromeres), centromeres segregating in an aberrant way, defects in the spindle pole bodies in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, defects in the kinetochore proteins, mutations in the centromeric DNA or defects in the molecular motors active during mitosis. A summary of these observations can be found in the article from Hardwick and collaborators in 1999.

Using its own observations, Zirkle was the first to propose that &quot;some (…) substance, necessary for the cell to proceed to anaphase, appears some minutes after C (moment of the arrival of the last chromosome to the metaphase plate), or after a drastic change in the cytoplasmic condition, just at C or immediately after C&quot;, suggesting that this function is located on kinetochores unattached to the mitotic spindle. McIntosh extended this proposal, suggesting that one enzyme sensitive to tension located at the centromeres produces an inhibitor to the anaphase onset when the two sister kinetochores are not under bipolar tension. Indeed, the available data suggested that the signal &quot;wait to enter in anaphase&quot; is produced mostly on or close to unattached kinetochores. However, the primary event associated to the kinetochore attachment to the spindle, which is able to inactivate the inhibitory signal and release the metaphase arrest, could be either the acquisition of microtubules by the kinetochore (as proposed by Rieder and collaborators in 1995), or the tension stabilizing the anchoring of microtubules to the kinetochores (as suggested by the experiments realized at Nicklas&#x27; lab). Subsequent studies in cells containing two independent mitotic spindles in a sole cytoplasm showed that the inhibitor of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is generated by unattached kinetochores and is not freely diffusible in the cytoplasm. Yet in the same study it was shown that, once the transition from metaphase to anaphase is initiated in one part of the cell, this information is extended all along the cytoplasm, and can overcome the signal &quot;wait to enter in anaphase&quot; associated to a second spindle containing unattached kinetochores.

== Background on sister chromatid duplication, cohesion, and segregation ==

=== Cell division: duplication of material and distribution to daughter cells ===

When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome. Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles. At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their DNA very precisely, a process termed DNA replication. Once DNA replication has finished, in eukaryotes the DNA molecule is compacted and condensed, to form the mitotic chromosomes, each one constituted by two sister chromatids, which stay held together by the establishment of cohesion between them; each chromatid is a complete DNA molecule, attached via microtubules to one of the two centrosomes of the dividing cell, located at opposed poles of the cell. The structure formed by the centrosomes and the microtubules is named mitotic spindle, due to its characteristic shape, holding the chromosomes between the two centrosomes. The sister chromatids stay together until anaphase, when each travels toward the centrosome to which it is attached. In this way, when the two daughter cells separate at the end of the division process, each one will contain a complete set of chromatids. The mechanism responsible for the correct distribution of sister chromatids during cell division is named chromosome segregation.

To ensure that chromosome segregation takes place correctly, cells have developed a precise and complex mechanism. In the first place, cells must coordinate centrosome duplication with DNA replication, and a failure in this coordination will generate monopolar or multipolar mitotic spindles, which generally will produce abnormal chromosome segregation, because in this case, chromosome distribution will not take place in a balanced way.

=== Mitosis: anchoring of chromosomes to the spindle and chromosome segregation ===
During S phase, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just at the beginning of mitosis, both centrioles achieve their maximal length, recruit additional material and their capacity to nucleate microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to generate the mitotic spindle. In this way, the mitotic spindle has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules (MTs) are long proteic filaments, with asymmetric extremities: one end termed &quot;minus&quot; (-) end, relatively stable and close to the centrosome, and an end termed &quot;plus&quot; (+) end, with alternating phases of growth and retraction, exploring the center of the cell searching the chromosomes. Each chromatid has a special region, named the centromere, on top of which is assembled a proteic structure termed kinetochore, which is able to stabilize the microtubule plus end. Therefore, if by chance a microtubule exploring the center of the cell encounters a kinetochore, it may happen that the kinetochore will capture it, so that the chromosome will become attached to the spindle via the kinetochore of one of its sister chromatids. The chromosome plays an active role in the attachment of kinetochores to the spindle. Bound to the chromatin is a Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that stimulates cytosolic Ran near the chromosome to bind GTP in place of GDP. The activated GTP-bound form of Ran releases microtubule-stabilizing proteins, such as TPX2, from protein complexes in the cytosol, which induces nucleation and polymerization of microtubules around the chromosomes. These kinetochore-derived microtubules, along with kinesin motor proteins in the outer kinetochore, facilitate interactions with the lateral surface of a spindle pole-derived microtubule. These lateral attachments are unstable, however, and must be converted to an end-on attachment. Conversion from lateral to end-on attachments allows the growth and shrinkage of the microtubule plus-ends to be converted into forces that push and pull chromosomes to achieve proper bi-orientation. As it happens that sister chromatids are attached together and both kinetochores are located back-to-back on both chromatids, when one kinetochore becomes attached to one centrosome, the sister kinetochore becomes exposed to the centrosome located in the opposed pole; for this reason, in most cases the second kinetochore becomes associated to the centrosome in the opposed pole, via its microtubules, so that the chromosomes become &quot;bi-oriented&quot;, a fundamental configuration (also named &quot;amphitelic&quot;) to ensure that chromosome segregation will take place correctly when the cell will divide. Occasionally, one of the two sister kinetochores may attach simultaneously to MTs generated by both poles, a configuration named &quot;merotelic&quot;, which is not detected by the spindle checkpoint but that may generate lagging chromosomes during anaphase and, consequently, aneuploidy. Merotelic orientation (characterized by the absence of tension between sister kinetochores) is frequent at the beginning of mitosis, but the protein Aurora B (a kinase conserved from yeast to vertebrates) detects and eliminates this type of anchoring. (Aurora B is frequently overexpressed in various types of tumors and currently is a target for the development of anticancer drugs.)

==== Sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis ====

===== Cohesin: SMC proteins =====
Sister chromatids stay associated from S phase (when DNA is replicated to generate two identical copies, the two chromatids) until anaphase. At this point, the two sister chromatids separate and travel to opposite poles in the dividing cell. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and in egg&#x27;s extracts in &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; identified a polyprotein complex as an essential player in sister chromatids cohesion (see the review from Hirano in 2000). This complex is known as the cohesin complex and in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is composed of at least four subunits: Smc1p, Smc3p, Scc1p (or Mcd1p) and Scc3p. Both Smc1p and Smc3p belong to the family of proteins for the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC), which constitute a group of chromosomic ATPases highly conserved, and form an heterodimer (Smc1p/Smc3p). Scc1p is the homolog in &quot;S.cerevisiae&quot; of Rad21, first identified as a protein involved in DNA repair in &quot;S. pombe&quot;. These four proteins are essential in yeast, and a mutation in any of them will produce premature sister chromatid separation. In yeast, cohesin binds to preferential sites along chromosome arms, and is very abundant close to the centromeres, as it was shown in a study using chromatin immunoprecipitation.

===== The role of heterochromatin =====
Classical cytologic observations suggested that sister chromatids are more strongly attached at heterochromatic regions, and this suggested that the special structure or composition of heterochromatin might favour cohesin recruitment. In fact, it has been shown that Swi6 (the homolog of HP-1 in &quot;S. pombe&quot;) binds to methylated Lys 9 of histone H3 and promotes the binding of cohesin to the centromeric repeats in &quot;S. pombe&quot;. More recent studies indicate that the RNAi machinery regulates heterochromatin establishment, which in turn recruits cohesin to this region, both in &quot;S. pombe&quot; and in vertebrate cells. However, there must be other mechanisms than heterochromatin to ensure an augmented cohesion at centromeres, because &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; lacks heterochromatin next to centromeres, but the presence of a functional centromere induces an increase of cohesin association in a contiguous region, spanning 20-50kb.

In this direction, Orc2 (one protein included in the origin recognition complex, ORC, implicated in the initiation of DNA replication during S phase) is also located on kinetochores during mitosis in human cells; in agreement with this localization, some observations indicate that Orc2 in yeast is implicated in sister chromatid cohesion, and its removal induces SAC activation. It has also been observed that other components of the ORC complex (such as orc5 in &quot;S. pombe&quot;) are implicated in cohesion. However, the molecular pathway involving the ORC proteins seems to be additive to the cohesins&#x27; pathway, and it is mostly unknown.

===== Function of cohesion and its dissolution =====

Centromeric cohesion resists the forces exerted by spindle microtubules towards the poles, which generate tension between sister kinetochores. In turn, this tension stabilizes the attachment microtubule-kinetochore, through a mechanism implicating the protein Aurora B (a review about this issue : Hauf and Watanabe 2004).

Indeed, a decrease in the cellular levels of cohesin generates the premature separation of sister chromatids, as well as defects in chromosome congression at the metaphase plate and delocalization of the proteins in the chromosomal passenger complex, which contains the protein Aurora B.
The proposed structure for the cohesin complex suggests that this complex connects directly both sister chromatids. In this proposed structure, the SMC components of cohesin play a structural role, so that the SMC heterodimer may function as a DNA binding protein, whose conformation is regulated by ATP. Scc1p and Scc3p, however, would play a regulatory role.

In &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, Pds1p (also known as securin) regulates sister chromatids cohesion, because it binds and inhibits the protease Esp1p (separin or separase). When anaphase onset is triggered, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C or Cyclosome) degrades securin. APC/C is a ring E3 ubiquitin ligase that recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme loaded with ubiquitin. Securin is recognized only if Cdc20, the activator subunit, is bound to the APC/C core. When securin, Cdc20, and E2 are all bound to APC/C E2 ubiquitinates securin and selectively degrades it. Securin degradation releases the protease Esp1p/separase, which degrades the cohesin rings that link the two sister chromatids, therefore promoting sister chromatids separation. It has been also shown that Polo/Cdc5 kinase phosphorylates serine residues next to the cutting site for Scc1, and this phosphorylation would facilitate the cutting activity.

Although this machinery is conserved through evolution, in vertebrates most cohesin molecules are released in prophase, independently of the presence of the APC/C, in a process dependent on Polo-like 1 (PLK1) and Aurora B. Yet it has been shown that a small quantity of Scc1 remains associated to centromeres in human cells until metaphase, and a similar amount is cut in anaphase, when it disappears from centromeres. On the other hand, some experiments show that sister chromatids cohesion in the arms is lost gradually after sister centromeres have separated, and sister chromatids move toward the opposite poles of the cell.

According to some observations, a fraction of cohesins in the chromosomal arms and the centromeric cohesins are protected by the protein Shugoshin (Sgo1), avoiding their release during prophase. To be able to function as protector for the centromeric cohesion, Sgo1 must be inactivated at the beginning of anaphase, as well as Pds1p. In fact, both Pds1p and Sgo1 are substrates of APC/C in vertebrates.

===Meiosis===

In mouse oocytes, DNA damage induces meiotic prophase I arrest that is mediated by the spindle assembly checkpoint. Arrested oocytes do not enter the subsequent stage, anaphase I. DNA double strand breaks, UVB and ionizing radiation induced DNA damage cause an effective block to anaphase promoting complex activity. This checkpoint may help prevent oocytes with damaged DNA from progressing to become fertilizable mature eggs. During prophase arrest mouse oocytes appear to use both homologous recombinational repair and non-homologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks.

== Spindle assembly checkpoint overview ==
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is an active signal produced by improperly attached kinetochores, which is conserved in all eukaryotes. The SAC stops the cell cycle by negatively regulating CDC20, thereby preventing the activation of the polyubiquitynation activities of anaphase promoting complex (APC). The proteins responsible for the SAC signal compose the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which includes SAC proteins, MAD2/MAD3 (mitotic arrest deficient), BUB3 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole), and CDC20. Other proteins involved in the SAC include MAD1, BUB1, MPS1, and Aurora B. For higher eukaryotes, additional regulators of the SAC include constituents of the ROD-ZW10 complex, p31comet, MAPK, CDK1-cyclin-B, NEK2, and PLK1.

=== Checkpoint activation ===

The SAC monitors the interaction between improperly connected kinetochores and spindle microtubules, and is maintained until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle. During prometaphase, CDC20 and the SAC proteins concentrate at the kinetochores before attachment to the spindle assembly. These proteins keep the SAC activated until they are removed and the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is made. Even a single unattached kinetochore can maintain the spindle checkpoint. After attachment of microtubule plus-ends and formation of kinetochore microtubules, MAD1 and MAD2 are depleted from the kinetochore assembly. Another regulator of checkpoint activation is kinetochore tension. When sister kinetochores are properly attached to opposite spindle poles, forces in the mitotic spindle generate tension at the kinetochores. Bi-oriented sister kinetochores stabilize the kinetochore-microtubule assembly whereas weak tension has a destabilizing effect. In response to incorrect kinetochore attachments such as syntelic attachment, where both kinetochores becomes attached to one spindle pole, the weak tension generated destabilizes the incorrect attachment and allows the kinetochore to reattach correctly to the spindle body. During this process, kinetochores that are attached to the mitotic spindle but that are not under tension trigger the spindle checkpoint. Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase of the chromosomal passenger complex functions as the tensions sensor in improper kinetochore attachments. It detects and destabilizes incorrect attachments through control of the microtubule-severing KINI kinesin MCAK, the DASH complex, and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex at the microtubule-kinetochore interface. The Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase is also critical in correcting merotelic attachments, where one kinetochore is simultaneously attached to both spindle poles. Merotelic attachments generate sufficient tension and are not detected by the SAC, and without correction, may result in chromosome mis-segregation due to slow chromatid migration speed. While microtubule attachment is independently required for SAC activation, it is unclear whether tension is an independent regulator of SAC, although it is clear that differing regulatory behaviors arise with tension.

Once activated, the spindle checkpoint blocks anaphase entry by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex via regulation of the activity of mitotic checkpoint complex. The mechanism of inhibition of APC by the mitotic checkpoint complex is poorly understood, although it is hypothesized that the MCC binds to APC as a pseudosubstrate using the KEN-box motif in BUBR1. At the same time that mitotic checkpoint complex is being activated, the centromere protein CENP-E activates BUBR1, which also blocks anaphase.

=== Mitotic checkpoint complex formation ===

The mitotic checkpoint complex is composed of BUB3 together with MAD2 and MAD3 bound to Cdc20. MAD2 and MAD3 have distinct binding sites on CDC20, and act synergistically to inhibit APC/C. The MAD3 complex is composed of BUB3, which binds to Mad3 and BUB1B through the short linear motif known as the GLEBS motif. The exact order of attachments which must take place in order to form the MCC remains unknown. It is possible that Mad2-Cdc20 form a complex at the same time as BUBR1-BUB3-Cdc20 form another complex, and these two subcomplexes are consequently combined to form the mitotic checkpoint complex. In human cells, binding of BUBR1 to CDC20 requires prior binding of MAD2 to CDC20, so it is possible that the MAD2-CDC20 subcomplex acts as an initiator for MCC formation. BUBR1 depletion leads only to a mild reduction in Mad2-Cdc20 levels while Mad2 is required for the binding of BubR1-Bub3 to Cdc20. Nevertheless, BUBR1 is still required for checkpoint activation.

The mechanism of formation for the MCC is unclear and there are competing theories for both kinetochore-dependent and kinetochore-independent formation. In support of the kinetochore-independent theory, MCC is detectable in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; cells in which core kinetocore assembly proteins have been mutated and cells in which the SAC has been deactivated, which suggests that the MCC could be assembled during mitosis without kinetochore localization. In one model, unattached prometaphase kinetochores can &#x27;sensitize&#x27; APC to inhibition of MCC by recruiting the APC to kinetochores via a functioning SAC. Furthermore, depletions of various SAC proteins have revealed that MAD2 and BUBR1 depletions affect the timing of mitosis independently of kinetochores, while depletions of other SAC proteins result in a dysfunctional SAC without altering the duration of mitosis. Thus it is possible that the SAC functions through a two-stage timer where MAD2 and BUBR1 control the duration of mitosis in the first stage, which may be extended in the second stage if there are unattached kinetochores as well as other SAC proteins. However, there are lines of evidence which are in disfavor of the kinetochore-independent assembly. MCC has yet to be found during interphase, while MCC does not form from its constituents in &quot;X. laevis&quot; meiosis II extracts without the addition of sperm of nuclei and nocodazole to prevent spindle assembly.

The leading model of MCC formation is the &quot;MAD2-template model&quot;, which depends on the kinetochore dynamics of MAD2 to create the MCC. MAD1 localizes to unattached kinetochores while binding strongly to MAD2. The localization of MAD2 and BubR1 to the kinetochore may also be dependent on the Aurora B kinase. Cells lacking Aurora B fail to arrest in metaphase even when chromosomes lack microtubule attachment. Unattached kinetochores first bind to a MAD1-C-MAD2-p31comet complex and releases the p31comet through unknown mechanisms. The resulting MAD1-C-MAD2 complex recruits the open conformer of Mad2 (O-Mad2) to the kinetochores. This O-Mad2 changes its conformation to closed Mad2 (C-Mad2) and binds Mad1. This Mad1/C-Mad2 complex is responsible for the recruitment of more O-Mad2 to the kinetochores, which changes its conformation to C-Mad2 and binds Cdc20 in an auto-amplification reaction. Since MAD1 and CDC20 both contain a similar MAD2-binding motif, the empty O-MAD2 conformation changes to C-MAD2 while binding to CDC20. This positive feedback loop is negatively regulated by p31comet, which competitively binds to C-MAD2 bound to either MAD1 or CDC20 and reduces further O-MAD2 binding to C-MAD2. Further control mechanisms may also exist, considering that p31comet is not present in lower eukaryotes. The &#x27;template model&#x27; nomenclature is thus derived from the process where MAD1-C-MAD2 acts as a template for the formation of C-MAD2-CDC20 copies. This sequestration of Cdc20 is essential for maintaining the spindle checkpoint.

=== Checkpoint deactivation ===

Several mechanisms exist to deactivate the SAC after correct bi-orientation of sister chromatids. Upon microtubule-kinetochore attachment, a mechanism of stripping via a dynein-dynein motor complex transports spindle checkpoint proteins away from the kinetochores. The stripped proteins, which include MAD1, MAD2, MPS1, and CENP-F, are then redistributed to the spindle poles. The stripping process is highly dependent on undamaged microtubule structure as well as dynein motility along microtubules. As well as functioning as a regulator of the C-MAD2 positive feedback loop, p31comet also may act as a deactivator of the SAC. Unattached kinetochores temporarily inactivate p31comet, but attachment reactivates the protein and inhibits MAD2 activation, possibly by inhibitory phosphorylation. Another possible mechanism of SAC inactivation results from energy-dependent dissociation of the MAD2-CDC20 complex through non-degradative ubiquitylation of CDC20. Conversely, the de-ubiquitylating enzyme protectin is required to maintain the SAC. Thus, unattached kinetochores maintain the checkpoint by continuously recreating the MAD2-CDC20 subcomplex from its components. The SAC may also be deactivated by APC activation induced proteolysis. Since the SAC is not reactivated by the loss of sister-chromatid cohesion during anaphase, the proteolysis of cyclin B and inactivation of the CDK1-cyclin-B kinase also inhibits SAC activity. Degradation of MPS1 during anaphase prevents the reactivation of SAC after removal of sister-chromatid cohesion. After checkpoint deactivation and during the normal anaphase of the cell cycle, the anaphase promoting complex is activated through decreasing MCC activity. When this happens the enzyme complex polyubiquitinates the anaphase inhibitor securin. The ubiquitination and destruction of securin at the end of metaphase releases the active protease called separase. Separase cleaves the cohesion molecules that hold the sister chromatids together to activate anaphase.

==== New model for SAC deactivation in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;: the mechanical switch ====
A new mechanism has been suggested to explain how end-on microtubule attachment at the kinetochore is able to disrupt specific steps in SAC signaling. In an unattached kinetochore, the first step in the formation of the MCC is phosphorylation of Spc105 by the kinase Mps1. Phosphorylated Spc105 is then able to recruit the downstream signaling proteins Bub1 and 3; Mad 1,2, and 3; and Cdc20. Association with Mad1 at unattached kinetochores causes Mad2 to undergo a conformational change that converts it from an open form (O-Mad2) to a closed form (C-Mad2.) The C-Mad2 bound to Mad1 then dimerizes with a second O-Mad2 and catalyzes its closure around Cdc20. This C-Mad2 and Cdc20 complex, the MCC, leaves Mad1 and C-Mad2 at the kinetochore to form another MCC. The MCCs each sequester two Cdc20 molecules to prevent their interaction with the APC/C, thereby maintaining the SAC. Mps1&#x27;s phosphorylation of Spc105 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate the SAC signaling pathway, but this step can only occur in the absence of microtubule attachment to the kinetochore. Endogenous Mps1 is shown to associate with the calponin-homology (CH) domain of Ndc80, which is located in the outer kinetochore region that is distant from the chromosome. Though Mps1 is docked in the outer kinetochore, it is still able to localize within the inner kinetochore and phosphorylate Spc105 because of flexible hinge regions on Ndc80. However, the mechanical switch model proposes that end-on attachment of a microtubule to the kinetochore deactivates the SAC through two mechanisms. The presence of an attached microtubule increases the distance between the Ndc80 CH domain and Spc105. Additionally, Dam1/DASH, a large complex consisting of 160 proteins that forms a ring around the attached microtubule, acts as a barrier between the two proteins. Separation prevents interactions between Mps1 and Spc105 and thus inhibits the SAC signaling pathway.

This model is not applicable to SAC regulation in higher order organisms, including animals. A main facet of the mechanical switch mechanism is that in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; the structure of the kinetochore only allows for attachment of one microtubule. Kinetochores in animals, on the other hand, are much more complex meshworks that contain binding sites for a multitude of microtubules. Microtubule attachment at all of the kinetochore binding sites is not necessary for deactivation of the SAC and progression to anaphase. Therefore, microtubule-attached and microtubule-unattached states coexist in the animal kinetochore while the SAC is inhibited. This model does not include a barrier that would prevent Mps1 associated with an attached kinetochore from phosphorylating Spc105 in an adjacent unattached kinetochore. Furthermore, the yeast Dam1/DASH complex is not present in animal cells.

== Spindle checkpoint defects and cancer ==
When the spindle checkpoint misfunctions, this can lead to chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and even tumorigenesis. Transformation occurs and is accelerated when maintenance of genomic integrity breaks down especially at the gross level of whole chromosomes or large portions of them. In fact, aneuploidy is the most common characteristic of human solid tumors and thus the spindle assembly checkpoint might be regarded as a possible target for anti-tumour therapy. This is a much underappreciated fact since mutations in specific genes known as oncogenes or tumor suppressor are primarily thought to be behind genetic instability and tumorigenesis. Usually the various checkpoints in the cell cycle take care of genomic integrity via highly conserved redundant mechanisms that are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. Several spindle assembly checkpoint proteins act both as positive and negative regulators to ensure the proper chromosome segregation in each cell cycle preventing chromosome instability (CIN) also known as genome instability. Genomic integrity is now appreciated at several levels where some tumors display instability manifested as base substitutions, insertions, and deletions, while the majority displays gains or losses of whole chromosomes.

Due to the fact that alterations in mitotic regulatory proteins can lead to aneuploidy and this is a frequent event in cancer, it was initially thought that these genes could be mutated in cancerous tissues.

=== Mutated genes in cancers ===

In some cancers the genes that underlie the defects resulting in transformation are well characterized. In the hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma cytogenetic abnormalities are very common due to the inherent nature of DNA breaks needed for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. However, defects in proteins such as MAD2 that function predominantly at the SAC also are characterized in multiple myeloma. Most solid tumors are also predominantly aneuploid. For colorectal cancer, BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 are key regulators that have been implicated in the genomic instability resulting in cancer. In breast cancer, the genetic form characterized by the BRCA-1 gene exhibits greater levels of genomic instability than sporadic forms. Experiments showed that BRCA-1 null mice have decreased expression of the key spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 . For other cancers, more work is warranted to identify the causes of aneuploidy.

=== Other genes not traditionally associated with the SAC in cancer ===

Clearly variations in the physiological levels of these proteins (such as Mad2 or BubR1) are associated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, and this has been demonstrated using animal models. However, recent studies indicate that what seems to happen is a more complicated scenario: aneuploidy would drive a high incidence of tumorigenesis only when alterations in the levels of specific mitotic checkpoint components (either reduction or overexpression) in tissues is also inducing other defects able to predispose them to tumors.
That is, defects such as an increase in DNA damage, chromosomal rearrangements, and/or a decreased incidence of cell death. For some mitotic checkpoint components, it is known that they are implicated in functions outside mitosis: nuclear import (Mad1), transcriptional repression (Bub3), and cell death, DNA damage response, aging, and megakaryopoiesis for BubR1. All this supports the conclusion that increase in tumorigenesis is associated with defects other than aneuploidy alone.

Cancer-associated mutations affecting known checkpoint genes like BUB1 or BUBR1 are actually rare. However, several proteins implicated in cancer have intersections to spindle assembly networks. Key tumor suppressors such as p53 also play a role in the spindle checkpoint. Absence of p53, the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer, has a major effect on cell cycle checkpoint regulators and has been shown to act at the G1 checkpoint in the past, but now appears to be important in regulating the spindle checkpoint as well. Another key aspect of cancer is inhibition of cell death or apoptosis. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, is localized in pools at microtubules of the mitotic spindle near the centrosomes and at the kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes. Not only does survivin inhibit apoptosis to promote tumorigenesis, but it has been implicated (through experimental knockout mice) as an important regulator of chromosome segregation, and late stage mitosis similar to its role in more primitive organisms.

Other aspects of the spindle assembly checkpoint such as kinetochore attachment, microtubule function, and sister chromatid cohesion are likely to be defective as well to cause aneuploidy. Cancer cells have been observed to divide in multiple directions by evading the spindle assembly checkpoint resulting in multipolar mitoses. The multipolar metaphase-anaphase transition occurs through an incomplete separase cycle that results in frequent nondisjunction events which amplify aneuploidy in cancer cells.

=== SAC cancer therapies ===

Advances in this field have led to the introduction of development of some therapies targeted at spindle assembly defects. Older treatments such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes target microtubules that accompany mitotic spindle formation via disruption of microtubule dynamics which engage the SAC arresting the cell and eventually leading to its death. Taxol and Docetaxel, which can induce mitotic catastrophe, both are still used in the treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other types of epithelial cancer. However, these treatments are often characterized by high rates of side effects and drug resistance.

Other targets within the network of regulators that influence the SAC are also being pursued; strong interest has shifted towards the aurora kinase proteins. The kinase gene Aurora A when amplified acts as an oncogene overriding the SAC leading to abnormal initiation of anaphase and subsequent aneuploidy and also resistance to TAXOL . Excitingly, a small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A has shown antitumor effects in an in vivo model suggesting that this might be a good target for further clinical development. Aurora B inhibitors, which are also in clinical development lead to abnormal kinetochore to microtubule attachment and abrogate the mitotic checkpoint as well. Survivin is also an attractive molecular target for clinical therapeutic development as it acts as a major node in a multitude of pathways, one of which is spindle formation and checkpoint control. Even further approaches have included a look at inhibition of mitotic motor proteins like KSP. These inhibitors, which have recently entered clinical trials, cause mitotic arrest and by engaging the spindle assembly checkpoint and induce apoptosis.

<doc id="996343" wikidata="Q1284299" url="?curid=996343" title="Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)">
<text>Josie and the Pussycats (formatted as Josie and the Pussy Cats in the opening titles) is an American animated television series based upon the Archie Comics comic book series of the same name created by Dan DeCarlo. Produced for Saturday morning television by Hanna-Barbera Productions, 16 episodes of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; aired on CBS during the 1970–71 television season and were rerun during the 1971–72 season.

In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, 16 episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972–73 season and were rerun the following season until January 1974. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, ABC, and NBC from 1974 through 1976. This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.

&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; featured a teenage all-girl pop band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. The group consisted of level-headed lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Josie, intelligent tambourine Valerie, and air-headed blonde drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular roadie Alan.

The show, more similar to &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; than the original &quot;Josie&quot; comic book, is remembered for its music, the girls&#x27; leopard print leotards (replete with &quot;long tails and ears for hats&quot;, as the theme song states), and for featuring Valerie as the first regularly appearing female black character in a Saturday morning cartoon show. Each episode featured a Josie and the Pussycats song played over a chase scene, which, similarly to &quot;The Monkees&quot;, featured the group running after and away from a selection of haplessly villainous characters.

==Series overview==
&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup on September 12, 1970, with the episode &quot;The Nemo&#x27;s a No-No Affair&quot;. The animated version of &quot;Josie&quot; was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Shazzan&quot;.

Like &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; was originally broadcast with a laugh track. Later home video and DVD releases omit the laugh track. Cartoon Network and Boomerang, however, have aired the show in its original broadcast format with the laugh track intact.

===Plot===
Each episode found the Pussycats and crew en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location where, somehow, often due to something Alexandra did, they became mixed up in an adventure. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some high-tech device. The Pussycats usually found themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains chased them to retrieve it. Eventually, the Pussycats would ruin the villain&#x27;s plans, resulting in a final chase sequence set to a Pussycats song. With the villain captured, the Pussycats would return to their gig or recording session, and the final gag was always one of Alexandra&#x27;s failed attempts to interfere with the Pussycats&#x27; performance or steal Alan away from Josie.

==Characters==
* Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; McCoy (voiced by Janet Waldo, singing voice provided by Kathleen Dougherty) – The red-headed lead singer, songwriter, guitarist, and leader of the band. Josie shares an attraction with Alan, the road manager. During the 1970s, the character was known as Josie James. (Judy Waithe was originally cast but replaced before the show debuted, as her readings of the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;-hosted &quot;In the Know&quot; interstitials were not to CBS&#x27;s liking; she is incorrectly credited in some copies of the episodes.)
* Valerie Brown (voiced by Barbara Pariot, singing voice provided by Patrice Holloway) – The band&#x27;s bassist and backup singer; most often shown playing tambourines. The voice of reason in the group, Valerie is highly intelligent and a mechanical wizard. During the 1970s, the character was known as Valerie Smith. 
* Melody Valentine (voiced by Jackie Joseph, singing voice provided by Cheryl Ladd as &quot;Cherie Moor&quot;) – The band&#x27;s drummer and backup singer and a stereotypical dumb blonde. What Melody lacks in intellect she makes up for with her perpetual sweetness and optimism. Her ears wiggle whenever there is danger. During the 1970s, the character was known as Melody Jones.
* Alan M. Mayberry (voiced by Jerry Dexter) – The group&#x27;s tall, blond, and muscular roadie and Josie&#x27;s love interest.
* Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Cabot III (voiced by Casey Kasem) – The group&#x27;s band manager, highly identifiable by his brightly colored mod wardrobe, sunglasses, and idiotic promotion schemes. He is the twin brother of Alexandra. Alex is an admitted coward but is good-hearted in sharp contrast to his sister Alexandra. Alex and Valerie have a slight attraction to one another at times. He also seems to be attracted to Melody. Alex physically resembles Shaggy Rogers in Scooby-Doo. In &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; crossover episode &quot;The Haunted Showboat&quot;, Casey Kasem voices both Alex Cabot and Shaggy Rogers.
* Alexandra Cabot (voiced by Sherry Alberoni) – The only girl who is not a Pussycat band member of Josie&#x27;s trio, but is still a member of the group. She is identified by her long black pony-tailed hair with a white streak through the center of it, similar to a skunk or a polecat (her bizarre appearance is an unexplained holdover from the comic book, where Alexandra had very limited supernatural powers, and this was the mark of the witch). Intelligent but also selfish, generally mean-tempered, grouchy and bullying, Alexandra is Alex&#x27;s twin sister. She appears to have no identifiable role with the band, nor any reason for associating with it, other than the fact that she is Alex&#x27;s sister and ally who tries to be the leader. She is constantly bitter and jealous of the band&#x27;s success without her, believing that she should be &quot;the &quot;real&quot; star of the band&quot; and that the band&#x27;s name should be &quot;Alexandra&#x27;s Cool-Time Cats&quot;. She constantly plots to steal the spotlight (and Alan&#x27;s affections) from Josie, only to have every scheme fail in humiliating fashion. She can be a good dancer. Despite her jealousy, she remains very loyal and does care for the group. She will usually fight with them against villains, using her brash personality to intimidate the opposition. Alexandra frequently saves the lives of her teammates, frequently rescuing the clueless Melody from falling into a villainous trap. Alexandra usually rivals Josie over their shared love interest Alan. She tries to steal Alan from Josie, but her plans consistently backfire. Alexandra is the only character who &quot;breaks the fourth wall&quot; and addresses the audience in soliloquy fashion, often in jealousy over Josie.
* Sebastian Cabot (voiced by Don Messick) – Alexandra&#x27;s snickering cat, whose black and white fur resembles Alexandra&#x27;s hair and whose utterances sound the same as another Messick-voiced character, Muttley, but he also serves as the loyal pet sidekick of the group (in one episode he uses his sense of smell to track the rest of the group like a dog). He enjoys being mean and sometimes appears to go to the enemy&#x27;s side, but usually only to trick the villain so he can have a chance to help the group escape. He sometimes uses his claws to pick locks. Alexandra sometimes recruits Sebastian to pull dirty tricks on Josie, but even these tricks usually backfire. Sebastian occasionally &quot;breaks the fourth wall&quot; and snickers to the audience. In &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; crossover episode &quot;The Haunted Showboat&quot;, Messick voiced both Sebastian and Scooby-Doo at the same time. Sebastian&#x27;s odd nature is a holdover from the comic book where he was a witch&#x27;s familiar, possessed by the mind of a powerful warlock ancestor of Alexandra. He has the same name as a 20th-century character actor and a 15th-16th century naval explorer.
* Bleep (voiced by Don Messick) – Bleep appears only in &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot;. He is Melody&#x27;s blue fluffy pet alien with pink extremities and makes a &quot;bleep&quot; sound (thus his name) which only Melody can understand. Bleep can also generate invisible sound waves from his mouth and eyes.

==Production and development==
===Origins===
During the 1968-69 television season, the first Archie-based Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, was a huge success, not only in the ratings on CBS, but also on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: The Archies&#x27; song &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; hit the #1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in September 1969, becoming the number one song of the year. Animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions wanted to duplicate the success their competitors Filmation were having with &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called &quot;Mysteries Five&quot; (which eventually became &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where are You!&quot;), they decided to go to the source and contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. Archie and Hanna-Barbera collaborated to adapt Archie&#x27;s &quot;Josie&quot; comic book into a music-based property about a teenage music band, adding new characters (Alan M. and Valerie) while dismissing others.

===The music===
In preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life Josie and the Pussycats girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album of songs to be used both as radio singles and in the TV series.

The Josie and the Pussycats recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young (a pseudonym for Bob Engemann of The Lettermen vocal group). They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability; early plans, which did not come to fruition, called for a live-action Pussycats segment at the end of each episode. After interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, Cherie Moor (later known as Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and Patrice Holloway as Valerie.

According to Danny Janssen&#x27;s recollections in his liner notes for the Rhino compilation CD, when he submitted his suggested studio singers, he was unaware that all three characters in the Archie comic book were caucasian. But Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s art and animation elements were already in production, so there was concern about going back and changing the character—not because of race but because of time, budget, and most of all, approvals. Janssen said that he could not return to Patrice Holloway and take her out of the trio so his only alternative was to leave the project. &quot;They were very nice about it,&quot; Janssen said, but they agreed that he could happily return for another project in the future. However, in the meantime, Hanna-Barbera, which would not have made such a change in the midst of production without consulting with Archie Comics (who controlled the characters), CBS (who approved the series), and Kellogg&#x27;s (the sponsor), did indeed replace Pepper with a new character named Valerie. Pepper disappeared from the comic book, and African-American Valerie took her place in December 1969. The timeline of her debut in the comic book bears out the production of the series and the development of the merchandise design guides, which include Valerie. Hanna-Barbera initiated this in order to replace Pepper with African-American Valerie to keep Patrice Holloway. They then hired African-American Barbara Pariot as Valerie&#x27;s speaking voice. Danny Janssen wasn&#x27;t aware that this had happened until weeks later when he was brought back as the music producer and made the records. The Valerie character was the first black female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; drummer Pete Jones had been the first black male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier, but Pete&#x27;s voice was not spoken by an African-American. Hanna-Barbera did cast Valerie&#x27;s speaking voice accordingly and Danny Janssen cast her singing voice, setting the historic precedent.

Of the songs that were broadcast, Patrice Holloway sang lead on the series&#x27; theme song, &quot;You&#x27;ve Come A Long Way, Baby&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Right With Me&quot;, &quot;The Handclapping Song&quot;, &quot;Stop, Look And Listen&quot;, &quot;Clock on the Wall&quot; and &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;. Holloway was the primary lead vocalist on &quot;Roadrunner&quot; which also features verses sung by Kathleen Dougherty and Cheryl Ladd. Ladd sang lead on &quot;Inside, Outside, Upside-Down&quot;, &quot;Dream Maker&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Make You Happy&quot;, &quot;The Time To Love&quot;, &quot;I Love You Too Much&quot;, &quot;Lie! Lie! Lie!&quot; and &quot;Dreaming&quot;. According to songwriter/vocal arranger Sue Sheridan (known as Sue Steward at the time), Dougherty felt she was stronger on harmony than lead and ceded her spotlight to Ladd. Essentially then, Josie was the group leader but Valerie and Melody provided the trio with its singing voices.

===Theme song===
The show&#x27;s theme song, titled &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, was written by Hoyt Curtin, William Hanna (under the pseudonym &quot;Denby Williams&quot;) and Joseph Barbera (under the pseudonym &quot;Joseph Roland&quot;). The theme song was based on melodies from an incidental tune that had been played on various Hanna-Barbera cartoons since &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. A soundtrack album of songs from the series was released in 1970 on Capitol/EMI Records.

A cover of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; performed by Juliana Hatfield and Tanya Donelly is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall on MCA Records. The theme song was also covered on the soundtrack of the 2001 live-action film based on the comic book series.

==&quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot;==

In September 1972, a sequel spin-off series titled &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; debuted on CBS. This version of the series launched the characters into outer space; the opening credits sequence shows the group taking a promotional photo at the launch site of a new spaceship. (It is unclear whether they were the ship&#x27;s assigned crew, or simply publicity guests.) A jealous Alexandra, elbowing the cast aside in order to steal the spotlight from Josie yet again, stumbles and causes a domino effect so that they are all jerked inside, accidentally triggering the launch sequence, which sends all into deep space. Val knows how to pilot the vessel. Every episode centered on the Pussycats encountering a strange new world where they would encounter and often be captured by various aliens-of-the-week before escaping and attempting to return to Earth. No matter what the scenario, Alexandra remains determined to stop Josie from getting too close to Alan. A typical ending for an episode is that they meet a wise benevolent person who reprograms the ship&#x27;s course for Earth, only to have a clumsy action by Alexandra (or occasionally Melody or Alex) set the ship on the wrong trajectory once again.

Musical numbers and chaotic chase sequences were set to 10 all original newly recorded songs specifically written as &quot;featured performances&quot; with Music &amp; Lyrics by ASCAP songwriter Richard Moyers, who was signed for the sequel by Roger Karshner, Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s new &quot;Musical Development Director&quot; and Produced by Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s in-house Musical Director Hoyt Curtin. All recordings were done by studio professionals known as &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; at Whitney Recording Studios, Glendale, CA for this spin-off as with the original. &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; also added the character of Bleep, a pet-sized fluffy alien adopted by Melody, who was the only one who could understand the creature&#x27;s language (he only says &quot;Bleep&quot; repeatedly) and numerous other alien animals encountered. Bleep and Sebastian fluctuate between being competitors or good friends throughout the series, with Don Messick providing the non-verbal chattering of both pets.

The series&#x27; premise is similar to &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965–1968), particularly that series&#x27; third season where the formerly marooned ship was allowed to visit a new planet each week a la &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Alexandra&#x27;s role parallels that of Dr. Zachary Smith – both are unpleasant characters, often at odds with the rest of the crew, whose blunders caused the initial loss in space. Bleep is similar to Debbie the Bloop, Penny Robinson&#x27;s pet who was played by a chimpanzee in a costume.

The 16 episodes of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; were re-run for the 1973–1974 season until January 26, 1974, when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new &quot;Josie&quot; episodes from Hanna-Barbera. &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; contained a laugh track as well, but it utilized an inferior version created by the studio.

Two VHS volumes of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, each containing four episodes of the original 1970 series, minus the laugh tracks, were released by Warner Home Video (Hanna-Barbera had been sold to Turner Broadcasting in 1991, with Turner merging with Time Warner six years later) on April 10, 2001, to coincide with the release of the live-action film. A &quot;Josie in Outer Space&quot; episode, &quot;Warrior Women of Amazonia&quot;, was featured in a clip/episode collection of Hanna-Barbera on VHS, released in the UK.

A &quot;Josie and the Pussycats: The Complete Series&quot; two-DVD box set was released in Region 1 (the United States, Canada, and Japan) on September 18, 2007. All 16 episodes, again minus the laugh tracks, were included, as well as a half-hour documentary on the life and career of Dan DeCarlo.

On October 19, 2010, Warner Archive released &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection of Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.

Both &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; were available on the Boomerang and HBO Max streaming services, with the latter featuring the series in remastered HD copies, until they were remove from both apps. Warner Archive released the HD versions of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; on Blu-ray on November 3, 2020, and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; on April 13, 2021.

==Reception==
&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; was named the 100th best animated series by entertainment website IGN, which referred to &quot;Josie&quot; as an amusing show for the way in which it combined elements from &quot;The Archie Show&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.

==After cancellation==

&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; made a final appearance as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973, episode of &quot; The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Showboat&quot;. Early production art for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1977 &quot;all-star&quot; &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; spoof &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot; featured Alexandra, Sebastian, Alexander, and Melody among other Hanna-Barbera characters as members of the &quot;Scooby Doobies&quot; team, but legal problems prevented their inclusion in the final program.

In 1976, Rand McNally published a children&#x27;s book based on the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; TV show, &quot;Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Josie and the Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour&quot;.

The original &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; series was re-run on NBC Saturday morning for the 1975–1976 season and weekdays in syndication from 1977 to 1982. In the mid-1980s, both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons, were on board USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Express&quot;; they would next appear on Cartoon Network in 1992, where all 32 episodes were run in the same time slot. Both programs, as of March 3, 2014, are in the library of Boomerang (Turner Broadcasting&#x27;s archive cartoon channel).

==Spin-offs and spoofs==
In 2001, Cartoon Network began airing a &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; short called &quot;Musical Evolution&quot; that featured the Pussycats performing their theme song through the various eras of popular music, including pop, disco, punk, Kiss-like heavy metal, country, and electronic dance music. Different animation styles are used for each era. That same year, the characters were adapted into a live action film. The film starred Rachael Leigh Cook as Josie, Tara Reid as Melody, and Rosario Dawson as Valerie.

DIC Entertainment, which had produced cartoon adaptations of Archie properties in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the early-2000s, had originally set out to create a cartoon based on the band (mainly in the wake of the 2001 film), before it was scrapped.

The 2004–2007 Comedy Central animated TV series &quot;Drawn Together&quot; featured a character named Foxxy Love. An African-American mystery-solving musician, she was a direct parody of the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; character Valerie Brown.

Several episodes of &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;, a later Hanna-Barbera show, had similar plots to some &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; episodes, specifically the two &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; episodes &quot;A Greenthumb is Not a Goldfinger&quot; (&quot;Island of the Giant Plants&quot; in &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;) and &quot;X Marks the Spot&quot; (&quot;Out of Sight&quot; in &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;), and the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; episode &quot;Warrior Women of Amazonia&quot; (&quot;The Hidden Valley of Amazonia&quot; in &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;).

The ship from &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot;, along with other iconic ships, appears as space debris in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Mobius Dick&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; was rebooted as a comic book. This update features a new version of the origin of the band, where struggling musician Josie joins up with her roommate Melody and Valerie, a veterinarian&#x27;s assistant, to start the Pussycats, despite the jealousy of Josie&#x27;s former best friend Alexandra.

The 2017 live-action TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot; featured Josie and the Pussycats as African-American students at Riverdale High School, portrayed by Ashleigh Murray (Josie), Hayley Law (Valerie) and Asha Bromfield (Melody). Murray later co-starred in the &quot;Riverdale&quot; spin-off &quot;Katy Keene&quot; starting in 2020 as an adult Josie, with Lucien Laviscount as Alexander and Camille Hyde as Alexandra.

Bleep appears in &quot;Jellystone!&quot; voiced by Jim Conroy. He visits Jellystone in &quot;Mr. Flabby Dabby Wabby Jabby&quot; and his self-titled episode. In the latter, Bleep befriended Cindy Bear and is shown to get vicious if given something that has hot sauce on it.

<text>Kilcock () is a town and townland in the north of County Kildare, Ireland, on the border with County Meath. As of the 2022 census, it had a population of 8,674, making it the eighth largest town in County Kildare and 61st largest in Ireland. The town is located west of Dublin, and is on the Royal Canal. It is in a civil parish of the same name.

Local industries include a large Musgrave Group distribution centre, which supplies SuperValu and Centra stores across much of the country.

==History==
Kilcock takes its name from the 6th century Saint Coca who founded a church beside the Rye River, a major tributary of the River Liffey. The saint is traditionally said to have been a sister of St. Kevin of Glendalough; by occupation, she was an embroiderer of church vestments, including those for St. Colmcille. A holy well dedicated to Coca, formerly thought to be lost in the back-yards of Kilcock, is believed locally to be in the area behind the Permanent TSB building, and her feast is remembered on 6 June. However, this commemoration is a modern revival as when the Ordnance Survey of the area was being made in 1837 it was recorded that &quot;there is no old church in ruins in this parish nor is any patron saint or day remembered... the meaning of the name Cille Choc is not remembered.&quot; When the present parish church was dedicated in 1867 it was named for St. Coca, and it had cost £10,000 to build to the design of architect J.J. McCarthy.

In the 8th century, there was a battle between rival kings near the church of St. Coca, then in the territory of Carbury and close to the border between Leinster and Meath. There is a gap of several hundred years until the next reference to Kilcock when, in 1303, it belonged to the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham.

In the 17th century, markets and fairs were held regularly in Kilcock. The tolls and duties of Kilcock Fairs were shared between the Wogans of Rathcoffey and the Eustaces of Castlemartin, Kilcullen, County Kildare. Kilcock had 70 acres (28 ha) of common land to which several inhabitants had a common right. There was also a Commons at Courtown (&quot;Bawnogue &amp; Duncreevan&quot;) and Laragh Commons.

The markets in Kilcock were probably the largest in North Kildare. A measure of oats in those times was referred to as a &quot;Kilcock Measure.&quot;

== Transport ==

The M4 motorway opened in 1994 and bypasses Kilcock to the south of the town. The motorway connects Dublin to the west of the country. There is a National Roads Authority (NRA) plan to create an outer orbital motorway, which would extend 80 km from Naas to Drogheda, via Kilcock.

Bus Éireann has route 115 and 115A (Summerhill) running from Dublin to Mullingar passing through Kilcock.

The railway arrived in Kilcock on 28 June 1847, but the station closed on 1 July 1848, as it was sited on a 1% (1 in 100) gradient which the locomotives of the day found difficult to start off from. This site was slightly east of the current Kilcock station. A replacement station opened in 1850 west of the town, where the old N4 crosses the Royal Canal and railway, but closed in 1963. The current Kilcock railway station, under Shaw Bridge, opened in 1998.

, construction was underway by the county council to pave a pedestrian and cycling path along the riverbank.

==Education==
Kilcock has three primary schools: Scoil Chóca Naofa, St. Joseph&#x27;s BNS (which since September 2016 changed from single-sex schools to mixed schools and both schools are linked with each other), and Gaelscoil Uí Riada (an all-Irish school). The latter is located beside the Bánóg on the outskirts of the village.

Kilcock is also home to the secondary school Scoil Dara. Located on Church Street, it accommodates over 900 students from Kilcock and surrounding areas including Donadea, Summerhill, Enfield, Moynalvey and Mulhussey.

==Places of interest==
The town&#x27;s library features mementos of the poet Teresa Brayton who was born in Kilbrook. The Old Bog Road, 4.5 km west of the town, was the subject of one of her verses. It was set to music by Madeline King O&#x27;Farrelly and recorded by artists including Josef Locke, Johnny McEvoy, Finbar Furey, Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, and Finbar Wright.

There is also the old manor where Lady Catherine McCormack was born in the 1800s.

Also nearby, in Calgath, County Meath, is &quot;Bridestream&quot; (an 18th-century house which is the headquarters to a local business), and &quot;Larchill&quot;, an 18th-century &quot;Ferme Ornée&quot; (ornamental farm). Larchill was restored from the mid-1990s, and there are walkways through beech avenues linking several classical and gothic follies. There is also a lake with two island follies, a formal walled garden with shell-lined tower and a model gothic farmyard.

Kilcock Art Gallery was established in 1978 by Breda Smyth and opened by George Campbell, RHA.

Kilcock has a greenway cycle/walkway which runs from Maynooth through Kilcock for 38 km towards the Westmeath border.

==Economy and community==
The town has a Lidl store which opened in February 2013, and also a SuperValu store which opened in June 2016. Kilcock Business Association has in excess of 50 members. 

Kilcock Musical &amp; Dramatic Society (KMDS) is an amateur musical society affiliated to the Association of Irish Musical Societies (AIMS), in existence since 1970. The society has produced a number of productions, both musical and non-musical since 1983. For example, the society presented the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 2012.

<text>Downtown El Paso is the central business district of El Paso, Texas.

== Historical downtown ==

James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown&#x27;s main business area was originally centered between Second Street and San Francisco Street. At a later point, the main business area was centered on Stanton Street and Santa Fe. In the late 1800s, most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio streets. Hispanic American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (&quot;little Chihuahua&quot;), which was located south of Santa Fe and west of Second.

Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans built railroads in the El Paso area. El Segundo Barrio is another historic neighborhood in the downtown area.

== Government and infrastructure ==

The Texas Eighth Court of Appeals is located in downtown El Paso. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, sitting in El Paso, is located in downtown. The years 2011–2012 mark the first survey–census ever conducted for Downtown El Paso, which identified key demographics and now benchmarks to move downtown revitalization forward.

The key census type information targeted employers, employees, and households in the downtown area about who eats, shops, and plays in downtown El Paso. This information was shared with entrepreneurs and companies evaluating business investment opportunities in the downtown area and property owners seeking new tenants to better target their marketing, recruitment and outreach efforts. Downtown El Paso is part of District 8. Currently, the district is represented by Cissy Lizarraga.

== Education ==

El Paso Independent School District provides K-12 educational services. It has its headquarters in Downtown, moving there in 2021. The headquarters were previously on the grounds of El Paso International Airport.

El Paso Public Library operates the Main Library in downtown area.

== Diplomatic missions ==
The Consulate-General of Mexico in El Paso is located in downtown.

<doc id="996358" wikidata="Q7642081" url="?curid=996358" title="SuperValu (Ireland)">
<text>SuperValu is a supermarket chain that operates throughout the island of Ireland. SuperValu is operated as a symbol group; each supermarket is independently owned, with individual owners using the SuperValu format and selling the chain&#x27;s own brand products. SuperValu outlets tend to be larger than the convenience shop formats used by many other symbol group retailers such as Centra, Gala and Spar, and the larger SuperValu units are on a par with full-service supermarkets. Their main competitors are Dunnes Stores and Tesco.

==History==

The supermarket was founded on out of the larger outlets in Musgrave&#x27;s VG chain (originally formed in 1960). The smaller VG shops became Centra. From a base of sixteen supermarkets (mainly in Munster), SuperValu had 182 shops in the Republic of Ireland and 36 in Northern Ireland as of 2004. Along the way, Musgrave has pursued a policy of buying shops itself and then re-leasing them to franchisees, acquiring some of the insolvent H Williams shops in 1987, L&amp;N in 1995, and Wellworths (in Northern Ireland) in 1996.

Wellworths-SuperValu was a trading name used briefly by Musgrave in Northern Ireland following its acquisition of small-to-medium Wellworths outlets in 1996. This was to distinguish from larger Wellworths supermarkets which were acquired by Safeway Stores (Ireland), a joint venture between Fitzwilton and Safeway (UK). In due course, the Wellworths name was entirely dropped.
SuperValu previously operated supermarkets in larger Roches Stores locations under the name &quot;SuperValu at Roches Stores&quot; for many years.

Superquinn was bought by the Musgrave Group, parent of SuperValu, in 2011. In August 2013, it was announced that all Superquinn supermarkets would be rebranded to SuperValu. The rebranding was completed in February 2014. As a result, SuperValu became the second-largest supermarket chain in the Republic of Ireland by grocery spend.

SuperValu&#x27;s stores in Spain are branded as Dialprix, Musgrave&#x27;s Spanish business. Due to this, the SuperValu brand name no longer exists in Spain.

<doc id="996362" wikidata="Q7190741" url="?curid=996362" title="Pick of the Pops">
<text>Pick of the Pops is a long-running BBC Radio programme; it was based originally on the Top 20 from the UK Singles Chart and was first broadcast on the BBC Light Programme on 4 October 1955. It transferred to BBC Radio 1 (simulcast on BBC Radio 2) from 1967 to 1972. The show returned to the BBC in 1989 and its current production run started on BBC Radio 2 in 1997. 
Its longest-serving presenter was Alan Freeman for almost 40 years, on and off, from 1961 to 2000. The current host is Mark Goodier, following the death of Steve Wright. 

==Original format (1955–72)==
Initially, the show did not feature chart music, but in September 1957, Alan Dell introduced the format of running through the charts of the week; he played the top tens from various music papers, plus entries to the top 20s.

David Jacobs broadcast the first averaged BBC Top 20 to the helm on Saturday 29 March 1958. Alan Freeman took over in September 1961, taking the show to a regular Sunday slot in January 1962. The programme ended in September 1972, while the Top 20 continued as part of &quot;Solid Gold Sixty&quot;.

Freeman, who became the show&#x27;s longest-serving presenter, had been a radio announcer in Melbourne, Australia. He arrived in Britain in 1957 and joined the Light Programme in 1960 to present &quot;Records Around Five&quot;. That same year, he replaced David Jacobs as presenter of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;, which was then part of a Saturday evening programme called &quot;Trad Tavern&quot;, named after traditional jazz, which had a following at the time. &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; became a separate programme in January 1962; it was produced by Derek Chinnery.

Denys Jones (producer 1961–72) and Freeman split the programme into four sections: chart newcomers, new releases, LPs and the Top 10. The programme attracted large audiences, as the BBC had &quot;needle time&quot; restrictions and could play relatively few commercially available recordings each week. Freeman continued with the show when it moved to Radio 1 and stayed until the programme ended on 24 September 1972.

==Revivals==
Freeman revived &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; on London station Capital Radio in 1982. This format was broadcast on Capital until 1988, as &quot;Pick of the Pops – Take Two&quot;, combining the new chart (Top 15s compiled successively by Record Business, the &quot;NME&quot; and MRIB) with a chart from the past. In 1989, Freeman returned to Radio 1 where the show featured three past charts each week; it was produced by Phil Swern until March 1992 and by Sue Foster for the rest of 1992. Freeman stood down from the programme in 1992, after stating then that he would not present the show again and signed off with The Beatles&#x27; &quot;The End&quot;.

However, Freeman revived the show on Capital Gold in April 1994 as &quot;Pick of the Pops – Take Three&quot;.

==BBC Radio 2 era==
===Alan Freeman===

&quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; returned to the BBC as an independent production by Unique Broadcasting on BBC Radio 2 on 5 April 1997, with Freeman now counting down two archive charts each Saturday afternoon, featuring the top 10s and interspersing trivia about the records, again researched by producer Swern. Freeman featured the years 1956 to 1991.

===Dale Winton===
Due to poor health, Freeman retired from radio broadcasting after presenting his last edition of the show on 1 April 2000. He was replaced by Dale Winton. 

&quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; then returned every week in September 2005, on a Sunday afternoon, again presented by Winton. BBC moved the show to a Saturday lunchtime slot in April 2009, where it remains today. Dale featured 1957 to 1999 during his tenure.

===Tony Blackburn===
Tony Blackburn replaced Winton in 2010. He was dismissed by the BBC in February 2016 for sexual abuse allegations. Tony featured 1956 to 2001. 

=== Paul Gambaccini===

Mark Goodier presented temporarily, replaced in turn by Paul Gambaccini in 2016.

Noel Gallagher guest-hosted the show on 29 May 2021, to mark his birthday. Gary Davies guest hosted the show on 21 and 28 August 2021 and 2 July 2022. Paul featured 1958 to 2006. with 1982 &amp; 1987 featuring more than 30 times during Gambaccini&#x27;s reign &amp; late 90s featured more from 2018- 2023.

=== Steve Wright ===
Steve Wright hosted the show starting in 2023. Steve pre-recorded the show as live and featured 1966 to 2002.

=== Mark Goodier ===
Gary Davies took over as an interim host in February 2024, following Wright&#x27;s sudden death. Goodier returned to the show to take over from Wright on a permanent basis from 6 July 2024, following his decision to leave Greatest Hits Radio. Goodier&#x27;s first show featured 1986 and 1998, and saw the return of listener messages being read out (although this was dropped again after a few weeks), as well as continuing to be live. On 18 February 2025, it was announced that the show would move to a new live timeslot on Sundays 5-7pm, in May.

The group was made up of Cathy Douglas (also known as Cathy Dougher, and whose real name was Kathleen Dougherty), Patrice Holloway, and Cherie Moor (later known as Cheryl Ladd).

Their bubblegum pop album of the same name was released by Capitol Records with Danny Janssen&#x27;s La La Productions. The group also released six singles in 1970 and 1971. All of the songs were re-released on a 2001 compilation, &quot;Stop, Look and Listen – The Capitol Recordings&quot;.

==Background==
In preparation for its upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera Productions began working on putting together a real-life &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; girl group, which was to provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also cut an album.

The &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; recordings were produced by La La Productions which included producer-songwriter Danny Janssen (who had written for Bobby Sherman and the Partridge Family), his business partner Bobby Young, and songwriters Austin Roberts, Sue Steward (now known as Sue Sheridan) and Bobby Hart (formerly one of the producer-songwriters for the Monkees). They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability, and, after interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Dougher as Josie, Moor as Melody, and Holloway as Valerie.

African-American with part-Hispanic background, Holloway was the younger sister of Motown legend Brenda Holloway. Having signed with the label as a solo artist in 1965, she was the only one of the three finalists with prior ties to Capitol Records (the label that released the Pussycats&#x27; album and singles). Her early Capitol singles, all highly collectible, include &quot;Ecstasy,&quot; “Stay With Your Own Kind,” and &quot;Stolen Hours&quot; (released between 1965 and 1967). Most were produced by Hollywood-based writer-producers Billy and Gene Page.

Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor had come to Hollywood from her native South Dakota with a country and western band that broke up and went back home almost immediately upon arrival. Shortening her unwieldy last name and now going as Cherie Moor, she decided to stay and try her luck as a singer, dancer and actress on television. After marrying David Ladd, she went on to replace Farrah Fawcett in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; prior to the filming of its second season in 1977. She also released a Gold album and a top-40 single (&quot;Think It Over&quot;) on Capitol the following year.

Janssen presented the newly formed band to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to finalize the production deal, but was in for a major surprise. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Holloway, as they had decided to portray &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; as an all-White trio, altering Valerie&#x27;s character to make her Caucasian. Janssen refused to recast Holloway, whose voice he felt he needed for the soul-inspired bubblegum pop songs he had written, and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented, allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being an African-American. Valerie had been introduced in the &quot;Josie&quot; comic book in late 1969, and the character had been African-American from the start.

Word quickly spread around Los Angeles about the stand that Janssen had taken. To show their gratitude, a number of the most notable soul session players in the city offered their services to La La Productions and the &quot;Josie&quot; album at a fraction of their regular fees. Among them were Elvis Presley&#x27;s drummer Ronnie Tutt, Elvis&#x27; bassist Jerry Scheff, keyboardist Clarence MacDonald, flutist Wilton Felder, and guitarist Mike Stewart.

==Overview==
The Josie and the Pussycats sound is modeled after the late 1960s Detroit acts such as Motown&#x27;s the Jackson 5 and Hot Wax Records&#x27; Honey Cone. A cover of the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; was featured on the soundtrack album while co-lead vocalist Holloway mimicked young Michael Jackson&#x27;s singing style. Holloway also sings lead on the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; theme song, which was written by Hanna-Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The theme itself is based on a recurring score cue from &quot;the Jetsons&quot;.

Other lead vocals were performed by Cherie Moor. Although she was cast as the singing voice of Josie, Kathleen Dougherty only sings partial lead vocals on &quot;If That Isn&#x27;t Love&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There.&quot; Also present on the album are covers of Bobby Sherman&#x27;s &quot;La, La, La (If I Had You)&quot;, the Carpenters&#x27; &quot;(They Long To Be) Close To You&quot;, and Bread&#x27;s &quot;It Don&#x27;t Matter to Me&quot;.

Although Janssen used strings, horns, keyboards, and oscillators (electronic synthesizers) to create the band&#x27;s sound, the on-screen cartoon band featured the trio of Josie on guitar, Valerie on tambourine, and Melody on drums.

&quot;Josie and the Pussycats: From the Hanna-Barbera TV Show&quot; was released on December 15, 1970, by Capitol Records. Six 45 RPM singles were released, four of which contained non-album songs and were available only as part of a Kellogg&#x27;s mail-order promotion. None of the singles charted, resulting in poor sales and a shelved national tour. Hanna-Barbera contracted producer Jimmie Haskell and a group of anonymous session singers to perform the music for &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot;, and La La Productions&#x27; Josie and the Pussycats group was officially disbanded. Janssen and Holloway worked together on several songs after the demise of the band (&quot;Black Mother Goose&quot; and &quot;Evidence,&quot; both issued in 1971), and Sue Sheridan (as Sue Steward) cut two solo singles for Capitol under Janssen and Young&#x27;s supervision. Several years later, Sheridan wrote a few songs for Ladd&#x27;s self-titled 1978 debut album, also released on Capitol Records.

The album, plus several singles and alternate takes, were collected in a limited edition digitally remastered set entitled &quot;Josie and the Pussycats: Stop Look and Listen: The Capitol Recordings&quot;, released by Rhino Handmade on October 5, 2001. Rhino pressed 5000 copies of the album. Earlier that same year, Babyface produced a new &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; album as the soundtrack for the motion picture released by Universal Pictures that same year. This new reincarnation of the Pussycats had a harder, punk-rock sound, as opposed to their Motown 1970 counterparts. Letters to Cleo vocalist Kay Hanley performed all lead vocals.

<doc id="996372" wikidata="Q2282869" url="?curid=996372" title="Banagher">
<text>Banagher ( or ) is a town in Ireland, located in the midlands, on the western edge of County Offaly in the province of Leinster, on the banks of the River Shannon. The town had a population of 3,000 at the height of its economic growth in the mid-19th century. According to the 2022 census, its population was 1,907.

Banagher was historically an important strategic location on the River Shannon and was one of the few crossing points between the provinces of Leinster and Connacht. It thus became a natural focus for a number of historical buildings, including a 19th-century Martello Tower and a number of castles around the town, which were built in the 14th and 15th centuries. The town used to be the focus of thriving river business and was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a number of industries, including a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted this to a certain extent with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an angling centre, with particular attraction for pike anglers. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for waterfowl.

==Etymology==
There are more than twenty places in Ireland called Banagher or a version thereof. Banagher can be derived as the anglicised version of the Irish &#x27;Beannchor&#x27; or &#x27;Beannchar&#x27;. Most Irish placenames relate to topographical features and this is the case with &#x27;Beannchor&#x27; - in this sense &#x27;beann&#x27; refers to or means a &#x27;peak&#x27; or &#x27;top&#x27; and is widely used in the names of hills and mountains while &#x27;cor&#x27; also appears in numerous placenames and refers to or means a rounded or curved hill, such as Cor Hill, Cormore, Corbeg Corbane and many others. A related interpretation uses the Irish form in its two-word version, understood in English as &quot;the place of the pointed rocks on the Shannon&quot;.

== History ==
It is thought that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was maintained between Rynagh&#x27;s Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher, and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh&#x27;s mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there does not seem to be an authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh&#x27;s death, although according to St. Rynagh&#x27;s Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.

=== Origins ===

The settlement that grew to become Banagher originated at a ford on the east bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.

Many of the early travellers were pilgrims. North-west of Banagher, on the Connacht side of the river, was the monastic establishment of Clonfert, with the more famous Clonmacnoise a short distance further north. Not far to the south-west on the same side was another monastic foundation, at Meelick. At Meelick, the three provinces, Leinster, Munster and Connacht meet and just south of Banagher in the direction of Birr, the four dioceses of Clonmacnoise, Meath, Killaloe and Clonfert meet.

=== Military history ===

At Banagher, there are ridges on both sides of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great strategic importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river in the area of the Shannon Callows had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.

The importance of Banagher as a military position on the Shannon and the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht was early appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about the middle of the 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place in spite of the fact that the part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was in the hands of the MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against all comers for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King&#x27;s County in honour of Philip, but it is doubtful if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621.

The town was incorporated by charter of Charles I on 16 September 1628. The corporation was allowed to elect two members to Parliament and hold two fairs per year, amongst other wide-ranging powers.

In 1628, a permanent military garrison was established which continued with slight interruptions until 1863. The defences were further strengthened and it was officially named Fort Falkland, after Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland who was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1622 to 1629. The forces of the Confederate Catholics took Banagher in 1642, but it was retaken by the Cromwellian Army in 1650, under the command of Henry Ireton, Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law. By 1652 the Cromwellian conquest was completed and the transplantation of the Catholic landholders to Connacht began in 1654. The lands from which they were expelled were divided among the adventurers and the soldiers of Cromwell&#x27;s army.

During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the garrison espoused the cause of James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence of the presence of Sarsfield&#x27;s Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.

The Irish garrison remained in Banagher without further molestation until the Battle of Aughrim, after which Banagher was evacuated. The English re-occupied the town, where they remained until the middle of the 19th century when Banagher ceased to be a garrison town.

=== Economic growth ===

In the 17th century, Banagher was the centre of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England practically killed the woollen trade. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher&#x27;s economy began to improve rapidly.

From 1800 to 1847, Banagher enjoyed a period of prosperity unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long been one of the chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal at the end of the 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area around the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of such fairs in Ireland.

The canal arrived at Shannon Harbour in 1804, and the water transport facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built on each side of the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who came to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.

=== Decline ===

Contrasted with the flourishing state of trade in the first half of the 19th century is the rapid and sustained decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller &amp; Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.

Various causes contributed to this decline. The abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller&#x27;s malthouse. The clearances in East Galway in the years immediately succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain.

The opening of Banagher Railway station in 1884, as the terminus of the Clara to Banagher branch of the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway Company, brought some improvement, with several passenger and goods trains every day. However, the fuel crisis of 1947 caused passenger services to be withdrawn from the line and it closed altogether in 1963. Although the site of the station is now covered by the marina, the trackway can still be seen, minus the track, at the gateway at the eastern corner of the marina.

== Geography ==

Banagher is situated in north-west County Offaly on the east bank of the River Shannon. It is south-west of Dublin, south-east of Ballinasloe, south of Athlone and north east of Limerick. It provides a crossing point between Offaly in Leinster and Galway in Connacht. Although Banagher is located in the flood-plain of the River Shannon, the town itself was developed on high ground and remains virtually flood-free all year round. North of Lough Derg, the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and regularly floods parts of the surrounding countryside. The resultant wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, is an internationally recognised wild bird and wildlife habitat and is classified as a Special Area of Conservation.

The country on either side of the Shannon in the Offaly-Galway area has been described as &quot;reminiscent of the Fens, cut off and intersected by waterways, by the wide meandering Shannon itself, by its tributaries, the Suck, the Brosna and the Little Brosna and by the Grand Canal; traversed by a maze of narrow roads.&quot;

The travel writer and biographer, James Pope-Hennessy, described the River Shannon at Banagher in September in his biography of Anthony Trollope: &quot;The month of September in Banagher, and all along the Shannon banks, is visually a glorious one, with golden autumn mornings, the low sun making long shadows of the houses in the street. At dusk the whole river reflects the varied sunsets as the days draw in – effects of palest pink, for instance, striped by cloudy lines of green, or an horizon aflame with scarlet and orange light.&quot;

The Slieve Bloom Mountains lie to the south of Banagher and the town is surrounded by the great bogs of the midlands, particularly to the east and west. The River Brosna is a major tributary of the River Shannon and meets the Shannon at Shannon Harbour, three kilometres north of Banagher.

=== Climate ===

Banagher has a temperate climate. Average daily high temperatures are in July and in January. Precipitation, at an average of 804 mm per annum, is similar to that in much of the midlands and east of Ireland, and is significantly less than the precipitation on the west coast, which averages between 1000 mm and 1250 mm per annum.

=== Wildlife ===

In autumn and winter, the extensive flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports a large number of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the Eurasian coot, common moorhen and little grebe. The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, common sandpiper and black-tailed godwit.

The corncrake can be seen at the bridge of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – one of the few places in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.

In winter, the resident bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, in particular the Eurasian wigeon and the Greenland subspecies of the white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and Eurasian otter, American mink and red fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, but pike is still plentiful and attracts anglers.

=== Demographics ===

Banagher was extensively planted by the English, particularly during the periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations had a profound impact on Ireland in several ways. The first was the destruction of the native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.

During the late 1960s to the early 1980s, several German, Dutch and Swiss settlers were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. In the early 21st century a number of people from Eastern Europe (for example Poland) moved to the area, and these now make up approximately 4% of the population.

In 2011, Banagher had a population of 1,653 (a 1.0% increase on the 2006 Census) with 801 male and 852 female residents. By 2022, the population had increased further to 1,907 inhabitants.

== Economy ==

The demise of the once-thriving canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher&#x27;s fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept many people in the locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland&#x27;s bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years ago and is now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher Precast Concrete Limited, a company specialising in precast concrete structures. The company employs approximately 150 people and was one of the largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel, and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the cruise liner businesses located at the marina, such as Silver Line Cruisers.

== Transportation ==

Banagher is an important crossing point on the River Shannon and consequently experiences a large volume of through traffic. Two regional roads meet in Banagher; the R356, which links the N62 and N65 national primary roads and is known as Harbour Street in Banagher and the R439 which links Birr with Banagher and is known as Main Street in Banagher. Harbour Street leads to the road to Shannon Harbour and Main Street begins at the hill at the southern entrance to the town and leads down to the bridge crossing the Shannon.

A railway station opened in Banagher in 1884 as the terminus for the Clara to Banagher line of the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway Company. It operated both a passenger and goods service until 1947 when the passenger service was withdrawn. The station closed completely in 1963.

Banagher was once a centre for river transportation on the Shannon system. River transportation fell into decline with the advent of rail and road transportation improvements. Banagher is still a centre for river cruisers, with a number of hire companies operating the town&#x27;s marina.

== Governance and administrative units ==
Banagher lies in the local council area of Offaly County Council. Local authorities have responsibility for such matters as planning, local roads, sanitation, and libraries. The Council is an elected body of 21 members with councillors elected from four electoral areas in the county. Banagher lies in the Birr electoral area, which returns five members to the council.

The town lies in the Barony of Garrycastle (&quot;Garraí an Chaisleáin&quot;) and was in the poor law union of Birr. Divided by the road to Birr from Eyrecourt, its eastern part lies in the townland of Curraghavarna and Portavrolla and its western part in the townland of Banagher or Kylebeg.

== Culture ==

=== Banagher Fair ===
As part of the charter of incorporation of 1628, the corporation was given powers to: &quot;hold two fairs, one on the Feast of St. Philip and Jacob, the other on the Feast of St. Simon and Jude, each to continue for two days.&quot; These feast days equated to 1 May and 28 October. However, a fair was already in existence in Banagher since 1612 and was held in September. These three fairs were certainly still in existence in the mid-1830s, as they were described in a government-commissioned report in 1835.

The fairs established by the first corporation continued to gain in size and importance during the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century. In 1826, the enormous number of 43,000 sheep was offered for sale at the September fair, with three-quarters of that number being sold. Pigot&#x27;s Directory of 1824 described the workings of the fair: &quot;...and there are three fairs; the principal one commences on the 15 September and continues for four days, the first for sheep, the second for horned cattle, the third for horses, and the last day is the country fair for linen, woollens and other merchandise.&quot;

It seems that the fair held in September was the main fair and is the one that has survived to the present. Pope-Hennessy described the granting of the charter by Charles I which &quot;empowered them to hold the famous Banagher Great Fair, at which everything from cattle and sheep to boots and basket chairs was on sale. This Fair, the greatest in all the Irish Midlands, began on September 15 and lasted four days. The line of horses tethered on each side of Banagher Main Street stretched from the Shannon river bridge to the crossroads two and a half miles outside the town known as Tailor&#x27;s Cross.&quot;

The fair had achieved an international reputation by the early 20th century and a local newspaper report of 1909 states &quot;The Banagher Great Fair was a huge success and among those present were Senor Gelline of Milan to make purchase on behalf of the Italian Government, while Mr Rodzanko bought for the Russian Government.&quot; The report also stated that &quot;Eighty-nine wagons of horses were entrained at Banagher Railway Station...this representing in round numbers about 500 horses.&quot;

=== Architecture, buildings and structures ===

==== Banagher Bridge ====

The first bridge that is known to have been built at this point was erected as a &quot;spacious stone bridge of 18 arches&quot; by Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (Anglicised Roderic O&#x27;Connor), the King of Connacht, around 1049. However, medieval sources tell of a &quot;bridge of 27 arches of divers(e) architectural form, each different from its fellow&quot;, which stood here for over 500 years. A stone bridge of 17 arches was certainly constructed in 1685 and this was detailed in profile drawings by Thomas Rhodes in 1833.

The bridge of 1685 featured prominently in the Williamite War in Ireland of the 17th century and was used by Patrick Sarsfield to retreat to Connacht after his ambush of a Williamite convoy at Ballyneety in County Limerick during the siege of Limerick. Because of its affording Sarsfield and his army a method of advance and retreat, the old bridge was often referred to as &quot;Sarsfield&#x27;s Bridge&quot;. This bridge was blown up in 1843 by gunpowder by a section of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The abutment of this bridge can still be seen adjacent to Cromwell&#x27;s Castle on the Connacht side of the river.

The present bridge of seven arches was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The engineer was Thomas Rhodes, one of the commissioners of the Shannon Navigation, whose name can be seen on many of the bridges over the Shannon and on surviving lock mechanisms, notably at Victoria and Athlone locks. This bridge was reconstructed and widened jointly by Offaly County Council and Galway County Council in 1971. Their work included replacing massive stone parapets on either side of the bridge with aluminium railings, and the removal of a swivel arch which had allowed passage for masted boats.

A heritage review of the bridges of County Offaly in 2005 described Banagher Bridge as of national heritage significance, of high architectural merit and demonstrative of mid-19th century construction work by a government body. It states &quot;This is the only six-arch masonry span in the county. It is an interesting contrast with the 1750s bridge at Shannonbridge. Although both are approximately the same length, Banagher Bridge achieves the crossing with fewer spans (six as opposed to 16). It also has the longest masonry arch spans of all the county&#x27;s bridges, averaging 17.88 m&quot;.

All of the castellations around and near the bridge were built to protect it, including Cromwell&#x27;s Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower. However, the guns mounted on these forts could be used to destroy the bridge if necessary, as well as to bombard attacking forces on the river.

A narrow quay passes under the old swivel section of the bridge from Waller&#x27;s Quay to the marina. A well-worn handrail offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the &quot;Duke&#x27;s Rail&quot; since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship &quot;Countess of Mayo&quot;. Disembarking at Waller&#x27;s Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King&#x27;s County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the &quot;Duke&#x27;s Rail&quot;. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was known for some time after as the &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s Route&quot;.

==== Barracks ====

This former constabulary barracks was built around 1800. Irregular in plan and now in ruins, it comprises a partially roughcast rendered rubble limestone enclosing wall with a cut stone segmental-headed entrance to the east and is situated to the south of the River Shannon, adjacent to the bridge. Remains of structures within the enclosure include a barrel-vaulted powder magazine built around 1806, with a gun platform above. These
walls are thought to be the perimeter walls of Fort Falkland from 1642. According to Pigot&#x27;s Directory of 1824, the barracks housed two companies of foot, had apartments for three officers, a bomb and waterproof magazine and an artillery battery mounting three 12-pound guns. The Directory also states that the barracks was formerly a nunnery (possibly that of Saint Rynagh, which would have been founded around 580) and communicated with &quot;Saint Rynagh&#x27;s Old Abbey&quot; by a subterranean passage of some 400 yards. After the British garrison left the town in 1863, the barracks was used by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and was looted and burned shortly after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The building was largely intact until the 1990s when the majority of the internal structures were illegally demolished.

==== Bow-fronted Georgian houses ====
Banagher has two bow-fronted Georgian buildings dating from the mid-to-late 18th century and both are listed as protected structures. One is a detached seven-bay, two-storey building, called Crank House, due to its location on the corner of Main Street and Crank Road. It was restored in the early 1990s by the Offaly West Enterprise Co-operative Society and opened in 1992. It was formerly used as the headquarters for Crann, an NGO dedicated to planting native trees and protecting Ireland&#x27;s woodlands. It is now used by the West Offaly Partnership as a Community Enterprise Centre which includes an exhibition hall, tourist office, retail and enterprise units and a hostel. The building is also the location of the Midlands branch office of Birdwatch Ireland.

The second of these buildings is a terraced, three-bay, three-storey house with an adjoining four-bay, two-storey coach house, which still has its original limestone carriage arch. It has been used as a hotel since the early 19th century and was home to Anthony Trollope during his stay in Banagher in the 1840s. It has a prominent location next to the marina and close to the bridge. Long called the &#x27;Shannon Hotel&#x27;, the name was changed to &#x27;The Royal Shannon&#x27; in the 1990s. It has ceased to trade as a hotel and is now falling into neglect.
==== Charlotte&#x27;s Way ====

Charlotte&#x27;s Way, formerly known as Hill House, is located close to Saint Paul&#x27;s Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s husband, Mr Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte&#x27;s death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Charlotte Brontë and the Brontë family is revealed in its present name. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast.

==== Cromwell&#x27;s Castle ====

The structure that stands on what is known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell&#x27;s Castle, primarily derives its current form from the Napoleonic Wars. Similar to the Martello Tower that stands opposite it, on the same bank of the river, Cromwell&#x27;s Castle was largely reconstructed as a defensive position to repel any invading fleet coming upstream towards Banagher.
The English had established many forts on the Leinster bank of the river, including Fort Frankford and, later, Fort Falkland (see Military History). The garrison at Fort Falkland was overrun by the forces of the Confederate Catholics in 1642 but was recaptured by Cromwell&#x27;s army in 1650. The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht bank of the river leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654. The castle was modified in 1817 to enable it to mount artillery with a platform for a 24-pound traversing gun constructed on its roof. Its interior became a powder magazine and housed a garrison of 20 soldiers.

Having fallen somewhat into disrepair, the structure came under the care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has been undertaken since then. The Canal Bank on which it stands is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a public amenity. Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.
==== Cuba Court ====
Cuba Court, also known as Cuba House, was a house dating from the 1730s and may have been constructed by one George Frazer, a former Governor of Cuba and perhaps to a design of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, who designed the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. It is certainly known to have been constructed with money from the sugar plantations in Cuba. In his biography of Anthony Trollope, James Pope-Hennessy describes Cuba Court as &quot;a fine example of an Irish country-house of the mid-eighteenth century in the manner of the Dublin architect, Pierce (sic). The building contained ... two circular rooms ... and an avenue of lime trees led to the front door.&quot; The Belfast writer, Maurice Craig, in &quot;Classic Irish Houses of the Middle Size&quot; (1976), describes Cuba Court as &quot;perhaps the most splendidly masculine house in the whole country.&quot; Towards the end of the 18th century, Cuba Court was the home of Denis Bowes Daly, who was a prominent member of the local ascendancy. Prior to his death in 1821 he had leased Cuba Court to the Army Medical Board on a 61-year lease. The building was little used as a hospital and the Medical Board was quite happy to give it up to the Commissioners of Education for the Royal School, which had eventually been established as a result of the Royal Charter of 1621.

Charlotte Brontë spent her honeymoon at Cuba Court in 1854 following her marriage to Arthur Bell Nicholls (See Charlotte Brontë). She noted of Cuba Court: &quot;It is very large and looks externally like a gentleman&#x27;s country seat – within most of the rooms are lofty and spacious, and some – the drawing room and dining room are handsomely and commodiously furnished. The passages look desolate and bare – our bedroom, a great room of the ground floor, would have looked gloomy when we were shown into it but for the turf fire that was burning in the wide old chimney.&quot;

During the 1820s, the Royal School at Cuba Court was attended by Sir William Wilde, who later married the poet Jane Francesca Agnes Elgee. The couple had two sons: Willie and Oscar Wilde, and a daughter, Isola Francesca, who died in childhood. Another pupil at the school was William Bulfin, the journalist and writer associated with Argentina through his work &quot;Tales of the Pampas&quot;, who attended in the 1870s. His son, Eamon Bulfin was one of the main participants in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to deportation to Argentina where he had been born.

Due to the Irish policy on rates at the time, the house was unroofed in 1946 and this hastened its demise. Pope-Hennessy described Cuba Court in 1971: &quot;Like so many of Ireland&#x27;s great houses, Cuba Court is now being slowly but deliberately demolished. The lime trees have long since been hacked down.&quot; In spite of this, it was described as &quot;a superb ruin that could tell the history of Ascendancy Ireland&quot;, as late as 1979. It was eventually acquired by a local businessman and demolished in the 1980s. Craig describes the loss of Cuba Court as &quot;particularly to be lamented&quot;. A development of four houses was built on the site at Cuba Avenue in 2003. An archaeological survey revealed nothing of significance.
==== Fort Eliza ====

Fort Eliza, also known as the Salt Battery, is a freestanding five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing on the east side of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell&#x27;s Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.

==== Martello Tower ====

Martello towers (or simply Martellos) are small defensive forts built in several countries of the British Empire during the 19th century, from the time of the Napoleonic Wars onwards. They stand up to high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15–25 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse a 360° arc. Fear of an invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte reached panic proportions amongst the authorities in Ireland and England in 1804 and the first towers were built in Ireland that year.

In case an invasion fleet tried to sail up the River Shannon, two towers were built on the middle reaches of the river to defend its crossing points. One of these was located at Meelick and the other at Banagher. The tower at Banagher is located on the west (Galway) bank of the river and measures in diameter and height. The tower was described in 1970 as having &quot;... no corbels, a ridge around the top, much vegetation growing around it, and its general condition is fair.&quot;
====Memorials and sculptures====

A memorial in the form of a stone Celtic Cross is situated at the eastern side of the town. It is known as the Barnes &amp; McCormack Memorial and dedicated to two local men who were executed in Birmingham in 1940 for their involvement in the Coventry Explosion of 1939 in which five people died. The executions caused a public outcry in Britain and internationally as the men had admitted to constructing the bomb, which was intended to be used to destroy a power station, but claimed not to be involved in planting it. The cross was erected in 1963 by The Barnes &amp; McCormack Memorial Committee in association with The National Graves Committee and bears an inscription in both Irish and English: &quot;In commemoration of Staff Captain James McCormack and Company Captain Peter Barnes, Irish Republican Army, who for love of country, were executed by the British Government at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham on the 7th February 1940.&quot; The monument was sculpted by Desmond Broe of Dublin and features images of the two men, a female head representing Ireland and symbols of the four provinces.

In December 2011 the Zimbabwean artist, Parazai Havatitye, a sculptor who specialises in wood carving, created a sculpture from a tree stump, entitled &quot;The Musician&quot;, which is dedicated to the musician Johnny McEvoy, who was born in Banagher in 1945. The sculpture is located on the main road, at the gate of the marina.
=== Places of worship ===

Arising from its history as a plantation garrison town, Banagher has active Catholic and Church of Ireland communities. The lane between Market Square and Pucka Lane (formerly Queen Street) is called Church Lane and it is here that the first church in Banagher was sited. The 6th-century abbey of St. Rynagh is now in ruins. This church later became the Church of the Blessed Mary in the 16th century, and was also known as the &quot;Church of Banagher&quot;. According to tradition, the &quot;Cross of Banagher&quot; once stood next to a crystal spring in the Market Square. The surviving sandstone shaft of the cross was found in the churchyard by a Birr antiquarian named Thomas Cooke in the 1840s and was in reasonable condition then as he described it in great detail in an article in the &quot;Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society&quot; in 1853. The stone that he found appears to have been part of a sepulchral or commemorative cross, set up at Banagher well to record the death of Bishop William O&#x27;Duffy, who was killed by a fall from his horse in 1297. Cooke had become so perturbed by the deterioration of the stone by 1852 that he had it removed to his residence in Birr. It is now housed in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. 

The Church of Ireland community had worshipped at the old church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul&#x27;s Church was built at the top of the hill, overlooking the town. An appraisal by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes the church as having &#x27;a handsome tower with spire&#x27;, containing pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows by the English glass-maker Arthur Louis Moore of London, and &#x27;the tall spire with pinnacles acting as a beacon to the local parishioners&#x27;. The most outstanding feature of St. Paul&#x27;s Church is the &quot;Window of the Resurrection&quot;, a stained-glass window commemorating the Bell family that was originally intended for Westminster Abbey in London.

The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh&#x27;s had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland. The church was built in 1825 with a bell-tower and spire added in 1872 to a design by William Hague Jr., a protégé of A.W.N. Pugin. An appraisal by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes the later addition of a bell tower with an elaborate door surround and finely-carved belfry openings as adding to the otherwise modest church. The appraisal also describe the tall stained glass lancet windows and a mandorla called &quot;The Madonna and Child&quot; carved in 1974 by German sculptor Imogen Stuart, as giving an artistic quality to the building.

=== Literature and the arts ===
Literary figures to have stayed at Banagher include Anthony Trollope, who used the town as an inspiration for his first novel &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot; and Charlotte Brontë who married a curate who was raised in Banagher. The town is the source of the phrase: &quot;Well, that beats Banagher!&quot;
The town was one of the settings for the series &quot;Pure Mule&quot;, as featured on RTÉ television. The mini-series was an RTÉ production and shot in 2005 in Banagher, Birr and Tullamore. The series was favourably received by some critics, although some locals maintained that it portrayed Midlanders in a bad light. The folk-singer Roger Whittaker took up residence in Banagher for about 10 years until 2006. During the time he purchased and renovated Lairakeen House.

==== Anthony Trollope ====

Banagher&#x27;s greatest literary association is with Anthony Trollope, who had been employed by the General Post Office in 1835 and was sent to Ireland in September 1841 at the age of 26. Trollope had had an unhappy life up to that point and remarked in his autobiography: &quot;This was the first good fortune of my life.&quot; After landing in Dublin on 15 September, he travelled by canal-boat to Shannon Harbour and then on to Banagher, arriving on 16 September, which coincided with the second day of the annual Great Fair. Although very much smaller than the town of Birr, which is only eight miles away, Banagher had been chosen as the base of a Postal Surveyorship, probably because its position on the Shannon offered easy access by can boat to Dublin and Limerick.

Trollope established himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow-fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 years old at that time. The hotel, which still exists, is located at the bottom of the town, close to the river. The post office where Trollope worked was at the top of the town, which is a few minutes away on foot. Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself.

Although Trollope&#x27;s initial knowledge of Ireland was limited, he soon noted that the Irish were good-humoured and clever – &quot;...the working classes very much more intelligent than those in England. They were not, as they were reputed to be, spendthrifts, but were economical, hospitable and kind.&quot; Their chief defects, he judged, were that they could switch to being very perverse and very irrational and that they were &quot;but little bound by the love of truth.&quot;

Trollope remained stationed at Banagher until late 1844 when he was transferred to Clonmel. It was while in Banagher that Trollope began to write his first novel, &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot;. He had begun to contemplate this novel whilst walking outside Drumsna in County Leitrim where the ruins of Ballycloran House stood into the 1840s and were still there in the 1970s. Trollope had been up in Leitrim inspecting the accounts of an errant postmaster. He thought the ruins of Ballycloran &quot;one of the most melancholy spots I had ever visited&quot; and he later described it in the first chapter of his novel. Although his first novel was initially unsuccessful, Trollope was undeterred and in all, went on to write forty-seven novels, as well as dozens of short stories and a few books on travel. He returned to England in 1856 and by the mid-1860s had reached a fairly senior position within the Post Office hierarchy. Postal history credits him with introducing the pillar box (the ubiquitous bright red mail-box) to Britain. Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882 and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==== Charlotte Brontë ====

Charlotte Brontë had a brief association with Banagher in the mid-1850s when she married one Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father&#x27;s curate. Nicholls was born of Scottish parents in County Antrim in 1818. He was orphaned early and subsequently brought up by his uncle, Alan Bell, in Banagher. Alan Bell was headmaster at the Royal School at Cuba Court at that time. The couple honeymooned in Ireland and stayed at Cuba Court for a period in June 1854. According to Pope-Hennessy, Mrs Nicholls disliked both Banagher and its inhabitants, although she greatly admired the surrounding countryside.

If Bell Nicholls was a poor unknown curate in England – in Banagher he was a member of a respectable family. In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot;, Charlotte wrote: &quot;My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep pleasure in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man.&quot;

In January 1855, Brontë discovered she was pregnant. It was accompanied by severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr Nicholls remained with Brontë&#x27;s father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife&#x27;s portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte&#x27;s letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write &quot;Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle&quot;, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte&#x27;s minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a drawer.

==== James Pope-Hennessy ====
James Pope-Hennessy came to Banagher in 1970 to write his biography of Anthony Trollope. Pope-Hennessy had published his first book, &quot;London Fabric&quot; in 1939, for which he was awarded the Hawthornden Prize and was a well-established biographer and travel writer by the time he arrived in Banagher. Among his works were a biography of Queen Mary for which he was rewarded by being created a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1960, &quot;Verandah&quot; (1964) a biography of his grandfather, the Irish colonial governor John Pope-Hennessy and &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot; (1967), an account of the Atlantic slave traffickers.

Like Trollope before him, Pope-Hennessy took rooms at The Shannon Hotel, near the river and set about trying to capture the essence of the town which had inspired Trollope&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot;. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced by the fact that he was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope-Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.

Pope-Hennessy stayed in Banagher from March 1970 to April 1971 and largely completed his study of Trollope during this time. The finished biography, &quot;Anthony Trollope&quot;, won the Whitbread Award for Biography in 1972 and is largely regarded as Pope-Hennessy&#x27;s finest work since &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Pope-Hennessy grew very fond of Banagher and returned to stay at The Shannon Hotel several times before his premature death in 1974. This is illustrated by his description of Banagher in &quot;Anthony Trollope&quot;: &quot;... in Trollope&#x27;s words, Banagher then seemed &#x27;little more than a village&#x27;. It retains a quality of friendly village life to this day and can have changed little since Trollope&#x27;s time, save that its population has declined to eleven hundred.&quot;

==== Sir Jonah Barrington ====
Sir Jonah Barrington was born in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen&#x27;s County (County Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. He voted against the Act of Union in 1801 and as a result, he was deprived of his £1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the &quot;Historic Memoirs of Ireland&quot;. It is thought that he was induced to delay the second volume – the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it was understood that to purchase his silence he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.

In 1827, he published two volumes of &quot;Personal Sketches of His Own Times&quot;. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he was removed from the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public money. The third volume of &quot;Personal Sketches&quot; appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his &quot;Historic Memoirs&quot;. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation&quot;. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.

== In popular culture ==

The town of Banagher is most likely the source of a phrase that is widely known in many English speaking countries in the world. &quot;That beats Banagher!&quot; is a common reaction to something extraordinary or to describe something that surpasses everything. The most commonly proposed explanation is that Banagher was entitled to send two members to Parliament following its charter of incorporation in 1628. It was known as an infamous pocket borough where the members were representative of the landed class, or indeed nominated by the local lord, without a vote taking place at all. When a member of the house spoke of a family (or rotten) borough, it was not unusual for someone to reply &quot;Well, that beats Banagher!&quot;

An alternative explanation is suggested, whereby there was an Irish minstrel called Bannagher, who was famous for telling wonderful stories; and a line from W. B. Yeats gives this theory some credence: &quot;&#x27;Well&#x27;, says he, &#x27;to gratify them I will. So just a morsel. But Jack, this beats Bannagher.&#x27;&quot; There is also an entry in Captain Francis Grose&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; of 1785 which says: &quot;He beats Banaghan; an Irish saying of one who tells wonderful stories. Perhaps Banaghan was a minstrel famous for dealing in the marvellous&quot;.

There are numerous uses of the phrase in literature, including Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Kelly&#x27;s and the O&#x27;Kellys&quot; (1848), p. 221; James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), p. 87.31; James Plunkett&#x27;s &quot;Farewell Companions&quot; (1977), p. 293 and Edna O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Down by the River&quot; (1996), p. 1.

The phrase has a riposte: &quot;And Banagher beats the Devil!&quot;. The origins of this are more difficult to trace but it does feature in a work by the Irish writer Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne, &quot;Messer Marco Polo&quot; (1925), p. 25, and it is in common usage in Ireland. Trollope asserted on his arrival in Ireland, &quot;I was to live at a place called Banagher on the Shannon which I had heard of because of its having once been conquered, though it had heretofore conquered everything, including the Devil&quot;. John O&#x27;Donovan, in an Ordnance Survey letter for King&#x27;s County in 1838, attempts to trace the origins of the name Banagher. He states: &quot;Of all the words which enter into Irish nomenclature Beannchair seems the most difficult of explanation&quot; and goes on to say &quot;This name &#x27;beats the Devil.&#x27;&quot; M.F. Kenny in his 2003 book &quot;Marathon Marriage&quot; uses a story of the devil losing a game of cards to a blacksmith named Banagher at the &quot;Black Stile&quot; at Garry Castle on the road between Banagher and Birr, as an explanation for the phrase.

== Education ==

St. Rynagh&#x27;s National School (NS) caters for children between the ages of 4 and 12 and accommodates approximately 200 students. Secondary education is provided by Banagher College (Coláiste na Sionna), a multi-denominational school under the responsibility of Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board. Banagher College is an amalgamation of La Sainte Union Secondary School and St. Rynagh&#x27;s Community College. La Sainte Union is a voluntary Catholic School run by the Sisters of La Sainte-Union des Sacrés-Coeurs, a congregation founded in France in 1826 by Abbé Jean-Baptiste Debrabant to promote Christian education. The school was their first in Ireland and opened its doors in 1863 in a house on Main Street when the Abbé arrived with Mother Anatolie Badger and three sisters of the order.

St Rynagh&#x27;s CC, originally known as Banagher Vocational School, opened in 1953 with 40 students enrolling under the guidance of the first principal, Ms Elsie Naughton. Amalgamation discussions began in 1999 and by November 2005 it was agreed that a new school be constructed on the La Sainte Union site. The school accommodates approximately 500 students.

== Sport ==

Banagher is home to St Rynagh&#x27;s GAA Club, which was founded in 1961 and represents the parishes of Banagher and Cloghan, with hurling played at Banagher and football at Cloghan. St Rynagh&#x27;s has won 20 Offaly Senior Hurling Championships (Sean Robins Cup) and dominated senior hurling in the county from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s. Outside of the county, St Rynagh&#x27;s were the inaugural winners of the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship, in 1971 and have won the title on a further three occasions, 1973, 1983 and 1994. The club also contested the first All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship final in 1971, losing to Roscrea from County Tipperary. Three St Rynagh&#x27;s players have captained the Offaly county hurling team to All-Ireland success, Padraig Horan in 1981, Martin Hanamy in 1994 and Hubert Rigney in 1998. A number of St Rynagh&#x27;s players have also won All Stars – Martin Hanamy (3), Aidan Fogarty (2), Damien Martin, Padraig Horan, Hubert Rigney and Michael Duignan. Damien Martin was the goalkeeper on the first All Stars team in 1971, effectively making him the first ever GAA All Star.

Banagher schools have won the All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship on seven occasions. Banagher College were the most recent winners of the senior championship in 2010, with Banagher having won on three previous occasions, in 1985, 1986 and 1989. Banagher also won a junior championship in 1984 and St Rynagh&#x27;s Banagher won a junior championship in 2004.

In 1910, Banagher won the Offaly Senior Football Championship title, playing as Banagher.

Soccer is also played in Banagher and the Banagher United club fields teams in the Midlands Senior and Junior Leagues.

A billiards and snooker hall is located between The Shannon Hotel and the Marina. There is a pitch and putt course located adjacent to Cromwell&#x27;s Castle on the Canal Bank and part of the river on this bank has been enclosed to form a swimming pool. There is also a sub aqua club in the town.

<text>Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre (18 June 1755 – 22 September 1821), also known as Madame Dugazon, was a French operatic mezzo-soprano, actress and dancer.

Born in Berlin as the daughter of a dancing master at the court of Frederick II of Prussia, she returned to Paris with her parents in 1765. She made her stage debut at the age of twelve as a dancer, but it was as an actress &quot;with songs&quot; that she made her debut at the Comédie Italienne in 1774 in Grétry&#x27;s &quot;Sylvain&quot;. She was at once admitted &quot;pensionnaire&quot; and in 1775 &quot;sociétaire&quot;.

She became a star of the Comédie Italienne (which became the Opéra-Comique), where she created over 60 roles. She was married to the actor Jean-Henri Gourgaud, who went by the stage name Dugazon. Together they had a child, Gustave Dugazon. The couple soon divorced, but continued to perform at the Comédie Italienne for more than twenty years.

The two kinds of parts with which she was especially identified—young mothers and women past their first youth—are still called &quot;jeunes dugazons&quot; and &quot;mères dugazons&quot; in French opera. Examples of the first are Jenny in &quot;La dame blanche&quot; and Berthe de Simiane in &quot;Les mousquetaires de la reine&quot;; of the second, Marguerite in &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot;. The type of voice for these roles is a light mezzo-soprano or a dark-colored soprano leggero, and they are generally less demanding technically.

== Roles created ==

<doc id="996385" wikidata="Q2266804" url="?curid=996385" title="Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler">
<text>Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler (Margaretha Désirée Victoria; born 31 October 1934) is a member of the Swedish royal family. She is the eldest child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the eldest sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf.

==Early life==

Margaretha was born on 31 October 1934 at Haga Palace in Haga Park, Stockholm, as the first child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and his wife Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; paternal granddaughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and his late wife Princess Margaret of Connaught; maternal granddaughter of Duke Carl Eduard I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein; she was born during the reign of her paternal great-grandfather King Gustaf V of Sweden. In January 1947, her father died in an airplane crash.

Although the eldest child, as a female, she was never in line to the throne according to the Swedish constitution current at the time. She was educated privately at the Haga Palace and then at the Stockholm dressmaking school, Märthaskolan (Martha School).

==Courtship and marriage==

She took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. 

Around 1957 Margaretha had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, a Scottish aristocrat and the nephew of the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home. He came to visit her in Sweden, but they never married. There was speculation in the press that this was due to Sibylla forbidding the match, but Margaretha&#x27;s nanny and confidante Ingrid Björnberg states categorically in her memoirs that the breakup between the two was caused by Margaretha&#x27;s reluctance to enter into an engagement with Douglas-Home.

She met her future husband, the businessman John Ambler, ten years her elder, at a dinner party in the United Kingdom in 1963 and their engagement was announced on 28 February 1964. They were married on 30 June 1964, in Gärdslösa Church, on the island of Öland. The Princess wore a wedding gown from the Stockholm couture school, Märthaskolan, where she had previously been a student, and a traditional wedding crown from Öland.

The couple for a time let Winslow Hall in Buckinghamshire. They settled at Chippinghurst Manor in Oxfordshire. As a result of her unequal marriage, she lost her style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and the King gave her the courtesy title of &quot;Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler&quot;. Under the Swedish constitution of that time, she, as a woman, and her descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne. Thus they still are not.

Ambler and her husband separated in 1994, but never divorced. He died on 31 May 2008.

The couple had three children:

* &quot;Sibylla&quot; Louise Ambler (born 14 April 1965 in London), married Freiherr Henning &quot;Cornelius&quot; von Dincklage (born 29 April 1971 in Esslingen am Neckar) in 1998. The couple had two children before separating in 2005:
** Freiin &quot;Madeleine&quot; Charlotte Margaretha von Dincklage (born 15 March 1999 in Munich), a goddaughter of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and bridesmaid at her wedding in 2010
** Freiherr &quot;Sebastian&quot; Eric Henning von Dincklage (born 8 September 2000 in Munich)
* Charles &quot;Edward&quot; Ambler (born 14 July 1966 in London), married Helen Jane Ross (born 3 March 1969 in Huddersfield) in 1999 and has two daughters:
** &quot;Sienna&quot; Rose Ambler (born 1 September 2000)
** &quot;India&quot; Tani Ambler (born 13 November 2003)
* &quot;James&quot; Patrick Ambler (born 10 June 1967 in Oxford), who served as page boy at the 1976 wedding of his uncle, King Carl XVI Gustaf. He married Ursula Mary Shipley (born 9 July 1965 in St Austell) in 2001 and has two children:
** &quot;Lily&quot; Elektra Ambler (born 28 February 2003)
** &quot;Oscar&quot; Rufus Ambler (born 10 September 2004)

==Later life==
In June 1960, Margaretha, with her first cousin Princess Margrethe of Denmark and her second cousin once removed Princess Astrid of Norway, toured the United States on the occasion of the first transatlantic flight by Scandinavian Airlines. During their visit, the three Scandinavian princesses toured Disneyland and Hollywood and also visited Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles where they met Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, and Elvis Presley.

Ambler lives near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, in the UK. Apart from taking part in family events and milestones, she does not have any official role or obligations either on behalf of Sweden or the royal family.

<doc id="996386" wikidata="Q1124843" url="?curid=996386" title="Boyle, County Roscommon">
<text>Boyle (; ) is a town in County Roscommon, Ireland. It is located at the foot of the Curlew Mountains near Lough Key in the north of the county. Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery, the Drumanone Dolmen and the lakes of Lough Arrow and Lough Gara are also close by. , the population of the town was 2,915. The town is in a civil parish of the same name and in the barony of Boyle.

==History==
===Early history===
On 15 August 1599, the Battle of Curlew Pass between English and Irish forces was fought in the Curlew mountains during the Nine Years&#x27; War, between an English force under Sir Conyers Clifford and a native Irish force led by Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill (Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell). The English were ambushed and routed while marching through a pass in the Curlew Mountains, with the English forces suffering heavy casualties. Losses by allied Irish forces were not recorded. The Queen&#x27;s principal secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, rated this defeat (and the simultaneous defeat of Harrington in Wicklow) as the two heaviest blows suffered by the English in Ireland.

Boyle suffered hardship during the famine years (1847–49). The following quote from the novel Woodbrook is one example: &quot;A retired herd, Mick Maxwell, speaking to Thompson about his grandfather during the famine, related the following: &#x27;when his grandfather, the only man strong enough, brought fifty and sixty corpses on a barrow, one by one, two miles from Cootehall near his home to the graveyard at Ardcarne&#x27;.&quot;

===19th century===
In 1859, Fraser&#x27;s Ireland described Boyle as including a &quot;sessions-house [courthouse], hospitals, schools, the houses and offices for the agents of the Lorton Estate, the police barracks, Church, Methodist chapel, public garden&quot;. The entry also noted the &quot;preservation of the fine ruins of the Abbey of Boyle, one of the most interesting of all our ecclesiastical structures&quot;, and that the town was &quot;one of the principal towns of County Roscommon, and carries on a considerable retail trade in the supply of necessaries for the surrounding district&quot;.

By 1881 Slater&#x27;s directory reported the town had a dispensary, three banks, three hotels and two newspapers. Boyle also had a post office, 40 grocery shops, 25 pubs (sixteen of which were also groceries), 12 bakeries and an assortment of businesses including fire insurance companies, booksellers, ironmongers and hardware stores, butchers, an auctioneer and churches for both Protestants and Catholics.

===20th century===
In 1917, Sinn Féin won their first ever seat in parliament for the constituency of Roscommon North, centred on Boyle, with the election of George Noble Plunkett. Plunkett&#x27;s son, Joseph Mary Plunkett, had been executed by the British in May 1916 for his association with the 1916 Rising. Michael Collins campaigned on the candidate&#x27;s behalf, as did Michael O&#x27;Flanagan, later to become President of Sinn Féin. A plaque on the courthouse, on The Crescent in Boyle, commemorates this. This was the first by-election following the Easter Rising of 1916 and it was crucial that the democratic mandate be obtained by Sinn Féin.

==Landmarks==
===King House===
King House is an early Georgian mansion located in the centre of the town and was restored in 1989 after some years of neglect, including surviving potential demolition for a car park. The house was built for Sir Henry King (d. 1839) MP, 3rd. Lord Kingston, between 1720 and 1740, whose family were one of the wealthiest in Ireland. It was subsequently home to Edward King, 1st Earl of Kingston. The design is attributed to William Halfpenny (d. 1755) who was an assistant to Edward Lovett Pearce.

The large U-shaped house may incorporate walls from an earlier 17th century house which was burnt. It is unusual in Ireland for the &#x27;big house&#x27; to be located in the town, as most houses are situated in a demesne. It is also unusual for the floors to be vaulted. Perhaps, according to Rev. Daniel Beaufort, this is a response to the earlier fire.

Since 1810, when the King Family moved to Rockingham, the house had been used as a military barracks. Throughout the nineteenth century, it was the home of the Connaught Rangers, adapted as a barracks for twelve officers and 260 soldiers. On the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the newly formed Irish National Army took possession of the house and it was renamed Dockery Barracks in honour of a commanding officer killed in Boyle during the Civil War.

Roscommon County Council purchased the building in 1987 and began a restoration project in 1989 following years of neglect. Using artisans and local craftsmen who employed traditional techniques and materials, the three floors and basement were restored. Included in the restoration were the main entrance gallery with its tripartite windows and original fireplace, the vaulted ceilings on all floors, and the main salon which is in use again as a venue for recitals and banquets. The other rooms in the house are used for temporary exhibitions and these are open to visitors. In The Kings of Connaught exhibition, visitors are led through a series of tableaux. The displays, ranging all over the floors, cover four main themes: The Kingdom of Connaught - from the earliest recorded times showing the importance of the clans and their kings; The King Family - meet the families who lived in the house from Sir John King who came to Boyle in 1603 to the fascinating accounts of life, both for the family and the staff, at Rockingham Estate (now Lough Key Forest Park); The Restoration - a room left partially restored so that visitors can see the fabric of the house.

===Boyle Abbey===

The Cistercian abbey was founded in the 12th century under the patronage of the local ruling family, the MacDermotts and is one of the best preserved in Ireland. It was colonised from Mellifont in 1161. The building of the chancel and the transepts with their side-chapels probably began shortly after this date, though the lancet windows in the east gable were inserted in the 13th century.

There is a combination of rounded and pointed arches in the transepts and crossing. The existing large square tower formed part of the church from the beginning, though it was raised in height at a later stage. The five eastern arches of the nave and their supporting pillars were built at the end of the 12th century, and have well-preserved capitals typical of the period. Although built at the same time, the arches of the northern side of the nave are different in type and have differently shaped columns and capitals. The three westernmost arches in the south arcade which have leafed and figured capitals were built after 1205, as was the west wall before the church was finally consecrated in 1218.

Nothing remains of the cloister, but on the eastern side, there are two doorways of c.1200, now blocked up. On the west side, there is a two-storey gatehouse, which acts as an interpretative centre. The rest of the buildings surrounding the cloister are largely 16th or 17th century. The Abbey was one of the most important in Connacht, and was invaded by Richard de Burgo, Maurice Fitzgerald, and Justiciar, in 1235. In 1659, the Cromwellians occupied the monastery and did a great deal of destruction. Though damaged during the 17th and 18th centuries when it was used to accommodate a military garrison, Boyle Abbey is one of the best preserved structures of its type, and attracts thousands of visitors per year. A restored gatehouse 16th/17th century vintage houses an exhibition. The Abbey is now a national monument in state care.

There is a Sheela na gig hidden above one of the central Romanesque arches. It can be seen from ground level, just at the top of the column, where the arch begins.

===Lough Key Forest Park===

Situated off the N4 is Lough Key Forest Park, a parkland area that has a visitor centre and activity facilities, including Boda Borg, a puzzle solving activity centre which is a Swedish concept originally unique to Sweden but now has locations in Ireland and the United States. The park covers , and was formerly part of the Rockingham estate. This was the seat of the Stafford-King-Harman family who at the end of the nineteenth century held over in north County Roscommon and County Sligo. Rockingham House was designed by John Nash in the early 19th century for the English landlord John King. It had a domed front and 365 windows.

Rockingham House was suspiciously destroyed by fire in 1957, after which it was taken over by the Irish Land Commission. Declared as unsafe in 1970, it was demolished. The tunnels to Rockingham House are still accessible to this day. A viewing tower was built in 1973.
In the town park, known locally as the Pleasure Grounds behind King House stood a statue of William of Orange. This was pulled down and destroyed by locals in 1945, though the base of the statue remains.

There are several islands on Lough Key. Castle Island is among the better known islands, while Trinity Island contains the ruins of a chapel, linked to the Cistercian monastery in the town. There are two trees growing on the island with interlinked branches, said to mark the graves of Una Bhan Mac Diarmid and Tomás Láidir Mac Coisdealbhaigh, two ill-fated lovers, celebrated in the poem Una Bhan.

===Other places of interest===

Abbeytown bridge is a five-arch stone bridge across the Boyle River close to the abbey. Originally built in the late 12th Century, it is one of the oldest surviving stone bridges in Ireland. It has been widened but still carries a 5-ton load.

The Drumanone dolmen (portal tomb) is just west of the town. It is a site of Irish and European historic archaeological significance. This Dolmen located outside Boyle, is an example of a portal dolmen and was built before 2000 BC. The capstone of the tomb, 4.5m x 3m wide, is one of the largest to be seen in Ireland. Drumanone Dolmen has portal stones more than 2m high and a doorstone about 2m high. The capstone is about 4m square and has slipped back to cover the polygonal chamber. The sides of the chamber are each composed of a single stone. It is located in pasture land approximately 300m north of the Boyle River.

The &#x27;Gaelic Chieftain&#x27; is a large sculpture overlooking the Curlew Pass just outside Boyle town, and commemorates the Battle of Curlew Pass.

==Transport==
Boyle railway station opened on 3 December 1862. Boyle lies on the railway line from Dublin to Sligo, and the N4 Dublin-Sligo main road skirts the town. The town is linked to the River Shannon navigation system via the Boyle canal, the Boyle River and Lough Key.
The town was once on the N4 national primary road from Dublin to Sligo but was bypassed in 1999. It is connected to the N4 by the R294 regional road (which also connects it to Ballina, County Mayo) and the N61 national secondary road which links Boyle to Athlone via Roscommon.
Boyle has a Locallink bus service to Roscommon three times daily.

==Local government==
Boyle was previously administered by town commissioners. After becoming a town council in 2002, and in common with all other town councils in Ireland, it was abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014. At the 2019 Roscommon County Council election, Boyle and its surrounding area formed a six-seat local electoral area.

<text>The Georgia State Capitol is an architecturally and historically significant building in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The building has been named a National Historic Landmark which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As the primary office building of Georgia&#x27;s government, the capitol houses the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state on the second floor, chambers in which the General Assembly, consisting of the Georgia State Senate and Georgia House of Representatives, meets annually from January to April. The fourth floor houses visitors&#x27; galleries overlooking the legislative chambers and a museum located near the rotunda in which a statue of &quot;Miss Freedom&quot; caps the dome.

==History==

The capitol site was occupied previously by the first Atlanta City Hall. To encourage the state government to relocate the capital city to rapidly growing and industrialized Atlanta from rural Milledgeville, the city donated the site. The 1877-79 Constitutional Convention voted in 1877 to permanently move the capital to Atlanta, and in 1879 accepted the city&#x27;s offer of the five-acre City Hall/County Courthouse tract, which was conveyed to the state in 1880. The first capitol in Louisville no longer stands, while in Augusta and Savannah the legislature met in makeshift facilities, perhaps causing (or caused by) the alternation of those two cities as capital. The legislature also met at other places, including Macon, especially during and just after the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War, which resulted in the capture and burning of Atlanta.

==Architecture==
Like many U.S. state capitols, the Georgia State Capitol is designed to resemble the Neoclassical architectural style of the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C. Former Confederate general Philip Cook was a member of the commission that oversaw planning and construction of the building. The commission engaged architects Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin Pierce Burnham, of Chicago to design the building and Miles and Horne of Toledo, Ohio for construction. Work completed in March 1889. Sculptor George Crouch executed all the ornamental work on the building.

The Capitol faces west on Washington Street. The façade features a four-story portico, with stone pediment, supported by six Corinthian columns set on large stone piers. Georgia&#x27;s coat of arms, with two figures on each side, is carved on the pediment. The Capitol&#x27;s interior represents the 19th-century style of its time. It was among the earliest buildings to have elevators, centralized steam heat, and combination gas and electric lights. Classical pilasters and oak paneling are used throughout the building. The floors of the interior are marble from Pickens County, which still produces marble today.

The open central rotunda is flanked by two wings, each with a grand staircase and three-story atrium crowned by clerestory windows. The Capitol building has undergone frequent renovations to adapt to the growth and change of government. Originally constructed from terra cotta and covered with tin, in a 1958 renovation the present dome was gilded with native gold leaf from near Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, where the first American gold rush occurred during the 1830s. For this reason, legislative business is often referred to as what is happening &quot;under the Gold Dome&quot; by media across the state. The statue &quot;Miss Freedom&quot; has adorned the dome since the building&#x27;s opening.

In 1997, the House and Senate chambers were restored to their 1889 appearance with replicated decoration and color schemes. This included the demolition of damaged plaster, the reinstallation of flat plaster at the dome, columns, and walls, and a decorative painting in the House and Senate Chambers.

==Georgia Capitol Museum==
The museum within the Capitol, in existence since 1889, houses extensive collections representing the natural and cultural history of Georgia. Native American artifacts, animals, rocks and minerals, and fossils illustrate the diversity of the collections. Removed during restoration or renovation, most of the collection remains in storage. The portraits of governors, statues of famous Georgians, and historic flags from many wars are displayed throughout the Capitol. The portraits of all governors elected since 1850 are there, except for Rufus Bullock.

The Georgia Capitol Museum is a public education institution housed in the Capitol building under the administration of the University of Georgia Libraries. The museum seeks to preserve and interpret the history of the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, the functions of the government, and the events that have occurred in the Capitol. To accomplish this, the museum collects, preserves, and interprets artifacts relating to the Capitol or associated with the events that have occurred there.

== Liberty Plaza ==

In 2015, the state of Georgia unveiled a large public plaza just east of the Capitol named Liberty Plaza. After its opening, numerous monuments were relocated from other parts of the Capitol grounds to the plaza, including replicas of the Liberty Bell and Statue of Liberty.

==Georgia&#x27;s Old Capitol Museum==

The Old State Capitol is at 201 East Greene Street, Milledgeville, Georgia, and served as state capitol from 1807 until 1867. The building was severely damaged by a fire on March 24, 1941 and was rebuilt in its former design to serve as a part of Georgia Military College. The first floor of the old capitol is open as a museum.

<text>&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; () is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe written in 1797. The poem is a ballad in 14 stanzas.

==Story==
The poem begins as an old sorcerer departs his workshop, leaving his apprentice with chores to perform. Tired of fetching water by pail, the apprentice enchants a broom to do the work for him, using magic in which he is not fully trained. The floor is soon awash with water, and the apprentice realizes that he cannot stop the broom because he does not know the magic required to do so.

The apprentice splits the broom in two with an axe, but each piece becomes a whole broom that takes up a pail and continues fetching water, now at twice the speed. At this increased pace, the entire room quickly begins to flood. When all seems lost, the old sorcerer returns and quickly breaks the spell. The poem concludes with the old sorcerer&#x27;s statement that only a master should invoke powerful spirits.

==German culture==
Goethe&#x27;s is well known in the German-speaking world. The lines in which the apprentice implores the returning sorcerer to help him with the mess he created have turned into a cliché, especially the line &quot;Die Geister, die ich rief&quot; (&quot;The spirits that I summoned&quot;), a simplified version of one of Goethe&#x27;s lines &quot;Die ich rief, die Geister, / Werd&#x27; ich nun nicht los&quot; - &quot;The spirits that I summoned / I now cannot rid myself of again&quot;, which is often used to describe someone who summons help or allies that the individual cannot control, especially in politics.

==Thematic variations==
Some versions of the tale differ from Goethe&#x27;s, and in some versions the sorcerer is angry at the apprentice and in some even expels the apprentice for causing the mess. In other versions, the sorcerer is a bit amused at the apprentice and he simply chides his apprentice about the need to be able to properly control such magic once summoned. The sorcerer&#x27;s anger with the apprentice, which appears in both the Greek &quot;Philopseudes&quot; and the Dukas score (and its film adaptation &quot;Fantasia&quot;), does not appear in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot;.

==Classical context==
&quot;Lover of Lies&quot; () is a short frame story by Lucian, written c. AD 150. The narrator, Tychiades, is visiting the house of a sick and elderly friend, Eucrates, where he has an argument about the reality of the supernatural. Eucrates and several other visitors tell various tales, intended to convince him that supernatural phenomena are real. Each story in turn is either rebutted or ridiculed by Tychiades.

Eucrates recounts a tale extremely similar to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Zauberlehrling&quot;, which had supposedly happened to him in his youth. It is, indeed, the oldest known variation of this tale type. There are several differences:
* The sorcerer is instead an Egyptian mystic – a priest of Isis called Pancrates.
* Eucrates is not an apprentice, but a companion who eavesdrops on Pancrates casting his spell.
* Although a broom is listed as one of the items that can be animated by the spell, Eucrates actually uses a pestle. (Pancrates also sometimes used the bar of a door.)

==Adaptations==
===Dukas symphonic poem===

In 1897, Paul Dukas wrote a symphonic tone poem based on the story from Goethe&#x27;s poem. This piece was popularized by its use as one of eight animated shorts based on Western classical music in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. In the piece, which retains the title &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, Mickey Mouse plays the apprentice, and the story follows Goethe&#x27;s original closely, except that the sorcerer (Yen Sid, which is &quot;Disney&quot; spelled backwards) is stern and angry with his apprentice after he saves him. &quot;Fantasia&quot; popularized Goethe&#x27;s story to a worldwide audience. The segment proved so popular that it was repeated, in its original form, in the sequel &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. Four of the animated brooms have a brief cameo appearance in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, working at cleaning a film studio while a human supervisor plays a saxophone version of Dukas&#x27; composition.

===Literary adaptations===
17th-century French author Eustace le Noble wrote a literary variant of this type of tale with &quot;L&#x27;apprenti magicien&quot;.

Other literary adaptations of the tale include several fiction and nonfiction books, such as the novel &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1910) by Hanns Heinz Ewers, and Christopher Bulis&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1995) based on the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Nonfiction books with this title include &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice: A Journey Through Africa&quot; (1948) by Elspeth Huxley, and the travel book &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1998) by Tahir Shah.

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels alluded to Goethe&#x27;s poem in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848), comparing modern bourgeois society to &quot;the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.&quot;

===Film and popular culture===

&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; is a 1962 episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; featuring Brandon deWilde as mentally-troubled youth Hugo, coveting the magic wand of a kindly magician.

The poem&#x27;s story is alluded to in several episodes of the fairy-tale drama &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, especially in &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (2014). A variation of the Dukas piece also plays in certain scenes. The apprentice himself is a recurring character, while the sorcerer is shown to be Merlin.

&quot;Top Secret Apprentice&quot;, a segment of the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode broadcast in 1991, is a modern version of the story, with Buster Bunny messing around with Bugs Bunny&#x27;s cartoon scenery machine and getting into trouble.

The 2010 film &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; features a scene based on the &quot;Fantasia&quot; conception of Goethe&#x27;s poem. The &quot;Fantasia&quot; variant also appears in the video game series, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, with the sorcerer Yen Sid serving as an adviser to the heroes, teaching Mickey, Sora, and Riku the Keyblade skills needed to guard the universe from his former friend Xehanort&#x27;s plan. A world based on the &quot;Fantasia&quot; version also appears throughout the series, serving as Yen Sid&#x27;s home.

The &quot;&quot; playing card Sorcerer&#x27;s Broom from Throne of Eldraine references the story and the replicating nature of the broom.

<text>Lobito is a municipality in Angola. It is located in Benguela Province, on the Atlantic Coast north of the Catumbela Estuary. The Lobito municipality had a population of 393,079 in 2014.

==History==

The city was founded in 1843 and owes its existence to the bay of the same name having been chosen as the sea terminus of the Benguela railway to the far interior, passing through Luau to Katanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The population of the municipality is 393,079 (2014) in an area of 3,648 km². The municipality consists of the communes Canjala, Egipto Praia and Lobito.

===Portuguese rule===
Lobito, was built on a sandspit and reclaimed land, with one of Africa&#x27;s finest natural harbours, protected by a 5 km long sandspit. The old municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) was created in 1843 by the Portuguese administration. The town was also founded in 1843 by order of Maria II of Portugal, and its harbour works were begun in 1903.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1843 that Maria II of Portugal approved the foundation of the town, which had by then been known as Catumbela das Ostras (&quot;Catumbela of Oysters&quot;)

Large developments, however, were not stimulated until the completion in 1928 of the important Benguela Railway, which connected Portuguese Angola with the Belgian Congo.

Under Portuguese rule, the port was one of Angola&#x27;s busiest, and the busiest of Africa, exporting agricultural produce from the interior and handling transit trade from the mines of southeastern Belgian Congo and of Northern Rhodesia. Fishing, tourism and services were also important. The carnival in Lobito was also one of the most renowned and popular in Portuguese Angola.

===Post-independence===

After the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, Angola was offered independence. Lobito&#x27;s port activities were highly limited by disruptions to railway transit and high insecurity during the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002). With peace and stability, in the 2000s, Lobito started the process of reconstruction and resumed its path to development.

== Climate ==
Lobito experiences a mild tropical arid climate with few temperature extremes. The winters are extremely dry and warm, while summers are relatively wet and hotter. 


==Transportation==

Lobito is the terminus of the Benguela Railway

===Port===

The Port of Lobito is located in Lobito Bay on a sandspit approximately 4.8 km long. The port is administered by the Empresa Portuaria do Lobito. The Port of Lobito handles 2,000,000 tonnes of cargo and 370 ships annually, and along with economic development in the Benguala region, port facilities are under expansion.

===Airports===

Lobito does not have its own airport. The city is located from Catumbela Airport and from Benguela Airport.

==International relations==

Lobito is twinned with:

* Sintra, Portugal
* Lowell, Massachusetts, United States

==Notable People==
*António Tavares (born 1960) - author and journalist

<text>This list ranks the top 150 U.S. cities (incorporated places) by 2024 land area. Total areas including water are also given, but when ranked by total area, a number of coastal cities appear disproportionately larger. San Francisco is an extreme example: water makes up nearly 80% of its total area of 232 square miles (601 km2).

In many cases an incorporated place is geographically large because its municipal government has merged with the government of the surrounding county. In some cases the county no longer exists, while in others the arrangement has formed a consolidated city-county (or city-borough in Alaska, or city-parish in Louisiana); these are shown in bold. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. In such cases, this list presents only that portion (or “balance”) of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place; these are indicated with asterisks (*). Cities that are not consolidated with or part of any county are independent cities, indicated with two asterisks (**).

<text>Cahersiveen (), sometimes Cahirciveen, is a town in the far south-west of Ireland, in County Kerry. As at 2022 it had a population of 1,297.

==Geography and access==
Cahersiveen is on the slopes of 376-metre-high Bentee, and on the lower course of the River Ferta. It is the principal settlement of the Iveragh Peninsula, near Valentia Island. The town is 50 km west of Killarney, and is connected to the Irish road network by the N70 national secondary road.

Cahersiveen was served from 1893 to 1960 by the Cahersiveen railway station on the Great Southern and Western Railway.

As at 2024 there are many Local Link buses every day to various local towns and villages, with some going to Killorglin, Killarney and Tralee.

==History==

In 1597, the Iveragh estate was received by Trinity College, Dublin as part of a royal grant. It previously belonged to the Earl of Desmond. The 8,808 acre estate stretched from Killorglin all the way to Valentia incorporating the parishes of Glenbegh, Killinane, Cahir, Killemlagh, Dromod, Prior and Valentia.

The Scottish civil engineer Alexander Nimmo first visited Cahersiveen in 1811 as sent by the Bog
Commission. He noted the lack of development, and poverty, in the estate, and that the main road to the area was unpassable by carriage at that time. Over the next few years, whilst planning the bogs of the estate he also designed many road and bridge plans. The most notable of these was the main road through Iveragh into the town built in 1822.

It was here the first shots of the Fenian Rising were fired in 1867.

Cahersiveen was the site of the murder of five local men taken in the early hours of the morning from Bahaghs Workhouse where they were held prisoner, shot in the legs then blown up with a landmine on 12 March 1923 during the Civil War.

==Mentions in literature==
Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;Post Captain&quot; gives Cahersiveen as the location of the character Stephen Maturin&#x27;s childhood home in Ireland.

:At present two Highlanders were talking slowly to an Irishman in Gaelic ... as he lay there on his stomach to ease his flayed back. &#x27;I follow them best when I do not attend at all,&#x27; observed Stephen, &#x27;it is the child in long clothes that understands, myself in Cahirciveen.&quot;
Cahirciveen is the central city in Brian Moore&#x27;s futuristic novel &quot;Catholics&quot;

==Places of interest==

The Catholic church in the town is the only one in Ireland named after a layperson, Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

The decommissioned Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, dating to the 1870s and now a heritage centre, was built in the distinctive &quot;Schloss&quot; style favoured by its architect, Enoch Trevor Owen. Because of this, it is often claimed to have been mistakenly built from the plans for a British barracks in India – a common myth heard in many Irish garrison towns.

The stone forts of Cahergall and Leacanabuaile stand close to each other a short distance from the town.

The ruins of Ballycarbery Castle are near to Cahergall and Leacanabuaile.

The town falls within the Kerry International Dark-Sky Reserve, the first Gold Tier Reserve in the northern hemisphere and one of only four Gold Tier Dark-Sky Reserves on earth.

== Gaeltacht Service Town ==
Cahersiveen is the eighth Gaeltacht Service Town, on the 15th of June 2023 the Minister of State Patrick O&#x27;Donovan launched the &quot;Cathair Saidhbhín Language Plan&quot; alongside Kerry County Council.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s primary school, Scoil Saidhbhín, opened in September 2015. This is an amalgamation of Scoil Mhuire, a boys&#x27; primary school and St Joseph&#x27;s Convent, a girls&#x27; primary school. There are four primaries in the parish of Cahersiveen, including those in the town&#x27;s hinterland: Aghatubrid National School, Coars National School, and Foilmore National School. Aghatubrid was established in 1964 and as of 2019 had about 75 students.

Coláiste na Sceilge is the town&#x27;s co-educational secondary school. Over 530 pupils attend from all around the Iveragh Peninsula.

An tAonad Lán-Ghaeilge is the local Gaelscoil - an all Irish-speaking class for 1st to 3rd-year students, where students do all their learning through Irish.

<text>A forwarder is a forestry vehicle that carries big felled logs cut by a harvester from the stump to a roadside landing for later acquisition. Forwarders can use rubber tires or tracks. Unlike a skidder, a forwarder carries logs clear of the ground, which can reduce soil impacts but tends to limit the size of the logs it can move. Forwarders are typically employed together with harvesters in cut-to-length logging operations. Forwarders originated in Scandinavia.

== Load capacity ==
Forwarders are commonly categorized on their load carrying capabilities. Other classifications include whether they are wheeled or tracked and the axle arrangement. The smallest are trailers designed for towing behind all-terrain vehicles which can carry a load between 1 and 3 tonnes. Agricultural self-loading trailers designed to be towed by farm tractors can handle load weights up to around 12 to 15 tonnes. Light weight purpose-built machines utilised in commercial logging and early thinning operations can handle payloads of up to 8 tonnes. Medium-sized forwarders used in clearfells and later thinnings carry between 12 and 16 tonnes. The largest class specialized for clearfells handles up to 25 tonnes. Forwarders also carry their load at least 2 feet above the ground.

<text>Core Audio is a low-level API for dealing with sound in Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS operating systems. It includes an implementation of the cross-platform OpenAL.

Apple&#x27;s Core Audio documentation states that &quot;in creating this new architecture on Mac OS X, Apple&#x27;s objective in the audio space has been twofold. The primary goal is to deliver a high-quality, superior audio experience for Macintosh users. The second objective reflects a shift in emphasis from developers having to establish their own audio and MIDI protocols in their applications to Apple moving ahead to assume responsibility for these services on the Macintosh platform.&quot;

== History ==
It was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah).

== Architecture ==
Core Audio supports plugins, which can generate, receive, or process audio streams; these plugins are packaged as a bundle with the extension .

<doc id="996421" wikidata="Q1036073" url="?curid=996421" title="Carhenge">
<text>Carhenge is a replica of England&#x27;s Stonehenge located near the city of Alliance, Nebraska, in the High Plains region of the United States. Instead of being built with large standing stones, as is the case with the original Stonehenge, Carhenge is formed from vintage American automobiles, all covered with gray spray paint. Built by Jim Reinders, it was dedicated at the June 1987 summer solstice. In 2006, a visitor center was constructed to serve the site. Carhenge was featured in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise spinoff webseries &quot;Cars on the Road&quot;.

==Structure==

Carhenge consists of 39 automobiles arranged in a circle measuring about in diameter. Some are held upright in pits deep, trunk end down, and arches have been formed by welding automobiles atop the supporting models. The heelstone is a 1962 Cadillac. Three cars were buried at Carhenge with a sign stating: &quot;Here lie three bones of foreign cars. They served our purpose while Detroit slept. Now Detroit is awake and America&#x27;s great!&quot;

Carhenge replicates Stonehenge&#x27;s current dilapidated state, rather than the original stone circle erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC.

In addition to the Stonehenge replica, the Carhenge site includes several other artworks created from autos covered with various colors of spray paint.

===Cars===

This table lists cars in Carhenge starting from the west entrance and proceeding left, or clockwise, around the outer ring of cars which represent the sarsen megalith circle of Stonehenge. The inner horseshoe of trilithons are also listed clockwise.

==History==

Carhenge was conceived in 1982 by Jim Reinders as a memorial to his father, who once lived on the farm now containing Carhenge. While living in England, he studied the structure of Stonehenge, which helped him to copy the structure&#x27;s shape, proportions, and size. It was built in 1987 by Reinders and around a crew of around 35 family members, and dedicated at the Summer Solstice. Other automobile sculptures were subsequently added to the location of Carhenge, which is now known as the Car Art Reserve. In 1992, Reinders removed a Toyota car from Carhenge, saying &quot;We wanted it to be an American Carhenge, not a Japanese Carhenge&quot;.

Reinders donated the 10-acre site to the Friends of Carhenge. In 2011, the Friends of Carhenge listed the attraction for sale for $300,000. In 2013, the Friends of Carhenge donated the site to the Citizens of Alliance.

Carhenge has appeared in film, popular music, television programs and commercials. For example: Film - &quot;Omaha, The Movie&quot; (1995); Popular music - Steely Dan (album cover, &quot;Remastered, The Best of Steely Dan&quot;, 1993); P.O.D. (music video, &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;, 2002); Television - &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot;; &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (episode: &quot;The Great Train Slobbery&quot;); Commercials - Nissan Pathfinder (2006), Nebraska Cornhuskers football (2007). It is the subject of the 2005 documentary &quot;Carhenge: Genius or Junk?&quot; and features in the 2007 travel book &quot;1,000 Places to See in the USA and Canada Before You Die&quot;.

The path of totality of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 included Carhenge. An estimated 4,000 people, including Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts, viewed the eclipse from the site. Reinders stated that, at the time of Carhenge&#x27;s creation, he had not known about the eclipse that would occur 30 years later.

<text>A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle in British usage, commonly known in some places as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism
such that the pedals always will spin together with the rear wheel. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the &quot;fixie&quot; has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.

Most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to the hub of the back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.

As a general rule, fixed-gear bicycles are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which would interfere with braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished with the use of an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear three-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brake.

==Uses==
A track bicycle or track bike is a form of fixed-gear bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or at an outdoor track.
Some road racing and club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for training during the winter months, generally using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials. The 1959 British 25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84-inch fixed-gear bicycle. The fixed-gear was also commonly used, and continues to be used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. A typical club men&#x27;s fixed-gear machine would have been a &quot;road/path&quot; or &quot;road/track&quot; cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear cycling.

In urban North America and similar areas in other Western cities, fixed-gear bicycles have achieved significant popularity, with the rise of discernible regional aesthetic preferences for finish and design details.

Dedicated fixed-gear road bicycles are being produced in greater numbers by established bicycle manufacturers. They are generally low in price and characterized by relaxed road geometry, as opposed to the steep geometry of track bicycles.

Fixed-gear bicycles are also used in cycle ball, bike polo and artistic cycling.

A fixed-gear bicycle is particularly well suited for track stands, a maneuver in which the bicycle can be held stationary, balanced upright with the rider&#x27;s feet on the pedals.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

One of the perceived main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.

In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).

Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.

Riding fixed is considered by some to encourage a more effective pedaling style, which it is claimed translates into greater efficiency and power when used on a bicycle fitted with a freewheel. It allows for the rider to engage in and practice proper cadence, which is the balanced and rhythmic flow of pedaling, enhancing performance for both cyclist and bicycle.

When first riding a fixed gear, a cyclist used to a freewheel may try to freewheel, or coast, particularly when approaching corners or obstacles. Since coasting is not possible this can lead to a &quot;kick&quot; to the trailing leg, and even to loss of control of the bicycle. Riding at high speed around corners can be difficult on a road bike converted into a fixed-gear bicycle, as the pedals can strike the road, resulting in loss of control. Proper track bikes have a higher bottom bracket to compensate for the constantly spinning cranks and largely mitigate this problem.

Perhaps the most obvious disadvantage is the lack of multiple gears, and the flexibility in pedaling cadence and resistance made available through gear shifting. Hilly or uneven mountainous terrain with steep grades can be particularly challenging, as the rider cannot adjust the gearing to match the terrain.

==Brakeless==

Many urban fixed-gear riders think brakes are not strictly necessary, and brakeless fixed riding has a cult status in some areas. Brakes and their cables are said to add extra bulk to the simple appearance of a fixed gear bicycle, and they prevent trick manoeuvres that involve spinning the front wheel in a full circle, unless equipped with special 360° freedom &quot;detangler&quot; system already used on BMX bicycles.

Other riders dismiss riding on roads without brakes as an affectation, based on image rather than practicality. Riding without brakes can be dangerous, is prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and may jeopardize the chances of a claim in the event of an accident.

===Technique===
It is possible to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider&#x27;s body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the riding surface. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider&#x27;s weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or toe clips and straps. The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight in opposition to the rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering.

On any bike with only rear wheel braking, the maximum deceleration is significantly lower than on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight is transferred towards the front wheel and away from the rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider&#x27;s weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.

===Legality===
Austria – Brakeless bicycles are illegal to ride on public roads. Every bike has to have two independent brakes, several reflectors and front and back lighting when conditions require it.

Australia – Bicycles are regarded as vehicles under the Road Rules in every state. A bike is required by law to have at least one functioning brake.

Belgium – All bicycles are required to have easy-to-hear bells and working brakes on both wheels. Lights and reflectors are not required on race, mountain, and children&#x27;s bikes during daylight hours. Other (normal) bicycles need reflectors and lights. These lights may be attached to the body and may blink.

Brazil – Brazilian Traffic Law, article 105, subheading VI, says that, for bicycles, &quot;bells, rear, front, sides and pedals signaling, and rear-view mirror on the left&quot; are mandatory. Albeit, nothing is explicitly said about bicycle brakes.

Canada – Laws vary by province, and are controlled by highway and traffic acts. In Ontario and in Québec, a rear brake is required, and not having one may subject the rider to a fine. Alberta requires one functioning brake.

Denmark – All bicycles are required to have working brakes on both wheels, reflectors, and bells.

France – Bicycles must have two brakes, two lights, numerous reflectors, and a bell to be approved for road traffic. The laws are rarely enforced, however, and all kinds of unapproved bicycles are common.

Germany – All bicycles are required to have working brakes on both wheels, reflectors, and bells. A local court in Bonn accepted that the fixed-gear mechanism was a suitable back brake, but high-profile crackdowns specifically targeted fixed-gear bicycles in Berlin in an attempt to control what police described as a &quot;dangerous trend&quot;

Hungary – All bicycles are required to be equipped with two independent sets of brakes. Front and rear lamps, reflectors and a bell are also required.

Italy – All bicycles must have tires, two independent sets of brakes, a bell, a front white lamp, a rear red lamp and reflector, and amber reflectors on pedals and sides. However, these regulations are rarely enforced.

 Korea - Brakeless bicycles are illegal in the Republic of Korea. Both front and rear brakes are required to ride a bike in public.

Netherlands – All bicycles are required to have an adequate brake system.

New Zealand – By law all bicycles must have a minimum of &quot;...a good rear brake...&quot;–and those made since 1 January 1988 must also have &quot;...a good front brake...&quot;

Poland – All bicycles must have at least one functional brake.

Russian Federation – All bicycles must have working brakes, handlebars and horns 

Singapore – In a report submitted to the Singapore Ministry of Transport in December 2020, the Active Mobility Advisory Panel recommended that a new rule be put in place to allow only bicycles that have brakes installed in order for them to be used on footpaths and roads. In January 2020, a 13-year-old fixed-gear bicycle rider died after she crashed into a railing at a multi-storey car park and fell to the ground below, prompting a state coroner hearing. A court decided that such bicycles are not suitable for the young, and her death was ruled as a misadventure.

Spain – All bicycles are required to have an adequate brake system on front and rear wheels, plus a bell.

Sweden – Bicycles are required to have a brake and bell. Additionally, when it&#x27;s dark outside they are required to have lights facing forward and back as well as reflectors facing forward, back and to the sides.

United Kingdom – The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983 require pedal cycles &quot;so constructed that one or more of the wheels is incapable of rotating independently of the pedals, be equipped with a braking system operating on the front wheel&quot;; riding a rear-wheel drive, fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake on public highways is illegal. Following the conviction of UK cyclist Charlie Alliston, who knocked over and killed a woman whilst riding a fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake, the UK Government announced a review of the laws covering &quot;dangerous cycling&quot; in September 2017. A brake on the rear wheel is only required for free-wheel bicycles.

United States – The use of any bike without brakes on public roads is illegal in many places, but the wording is often similar to &quot;...must be equipped with a brake that will enable the person operating the cycle to make the braked wheels skid on dry, level and clean pavement...&quot; which some have argued allows the use of the legs and gears. The retail sale of bikes without brakes is banned by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission – but with an exception for the &quot;track bicycle&quot; (...&quot;a bicycle designed and intended for sale as a competitive machine having tubular tires, single crank-to-wheel ratio, and no free-wheeling feature between the rear wheel and the crank...&quot;).

==Conversion==
Many companies sell bicycle frames designed specifically for use with fixed-gear hubs. A fixed-gear or track-bike hub includes special threads for a lockring that tightens in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction compared with the sprocket. This ensures that the sprocket cannot unscrew when the rider &quot;backpedals&quot; while braking.

Many cyclists choose to convert freewheel bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another is to use a hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the sprocket and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the sprocket unscrews while backpedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the sprocket and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or &quot;frame whipping&quot;) method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.

===Chain tension===

Bicycles with vertical dropouts and no derailleur require some way to adjust chain tension. Most bicycles with horizontal dropouts can be tensioned by moving the wheel forward or backward in the dropouts. Bicycles with vertical dropouts can also be converted with some additional hardware. Possibilities include:

* An &quot;eccentric&quot; hub or bottom bracket allows the off center axle or bottom bracket spindle to pivot and change the chain tension.
* A &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;floating&quot; chainring is an additional chainring in the drive train between the driving chainring and sprocket. The top of the chain moves it forward at the same speed that the bottom of the chain moves it backwards, giving the appearance that it is floating in the chain.
* A &quot;magic gear&quot;—the right math can calculate a gearing ratio to fit a taut chain between the rear dropout and bottom bracket. Also, using a chain half link and slightly filing the dropouts to increase the width of the slot increases the chances of finding a magic gear. It is worth noting that the magic gear setup is controversial, due to inevitable chain stretch and subsequent slippage that can lead to serious injury.

Separate chain tensioning devices, such as the type that attaches to the dropout (commonly used on single speed mountain bikes) cannot be used because they are damaged as soon as the lower part of the chain becomes tight.

===Chainline===

Additional adjustments or modification may be needed to ensure a good chainline. The chain should run straight from the chainring to the sprocket, therefore both must be the same distance away from the bicycle&#x27;s centerline. Matched groupsets of track components are normally designed to give a chainline of 42 mm, but conversions using road or mountain bike cranksets often use more chainline. Some hubs, such as White Industries&#x27; ENO, or the British Goldtec track hub, are better suited to this task as they have a chainline greater than standard. Failure to achieve good chainline, at best, leads to a noisy chain and increased wear, and at worst can throw the chain off the sprocket. This can result in rear wheel lockup and a wrecked frame if the chain falls between the rear sprocket and the spokes. Chainline can be adjusted in a number of ways, which may be used in combination with each other:

* Obtaining a bottom bracket with a different spindle length, to move the chainring inboard or outboard
* Choosing a bottom bracket with two lockrings, which gives fine adjustment of chainring position
* Respacing and redishing the rear wheel, where permitted by the hub design
* Placing thin spacers under the bottom bracket&#x27;s right-hand cup (Sturmey-Archer make a suitable 1/16&quot; spacer) to move the chainring outboard
* Placing thin spacers between the chainring and its stack bolts to move it inboard (if the chainring is on the inside of the crank spider) or outboard (if the ring is on the outside of the spider)
* Placing thin spacers between the hub shoulder and the sprocket. This is recommended in the case of a freewheel-threaded hub, which has sufficiently deep threads for this operation.

Usually, the rear hub is the best component on which to perform chainline adjustments, especially on threaded hubs. If a track hub is used, it is better to operate on the bottom bracket or - for minor shifts - on the crankset. The same occurs if a flip-flop hub is used, because the chainline should be the same in both sides (freewheel and fixed gear).

===Gear ratio===

Since fixed-gear bicycles do not have the capability to change gears on the fly, riders must choose their preferred gear ratio beforehand. A commonly used gear ratio that works well in most situations is 2.75:1, which can be implemented with a 44-tooth chainring and a 16-tooth rear sprocket.

==Competition==
There are many forms of competition using a fixed gear bike, most of the competitions being track races. Formal track races most often take place in a velodrome, a circular track that is constructed of concrete or wood and can be indoor or outdoor. Race types such as common scratch races or more complex omnium races take place in these arenas.

Keirin is a form of motor-paced cycle racing on a track with fixed-gear bicycle that meet a strict system of standards.

Moreover, bike messengers and other urban riders may ride fixed gear bicycles in alleycat races, which are normally held in city streets, including New York City&#x27;s famous fixed-gear-only race Monstertrack alleycat. Wolfpack Hustle began in 2005 as ride bringing together faster cyclists with the common love for riding. The group ride later expanded to an internationally known race series that takes place in Los Angeles, California. The group has managed to receive sponsorships from several well-known companies including Castelli, a bicycle apparel manufacturer, helping spread interest and knowledge about the group and the races they hold. In San Francisco, California, Red Bull at one point held Red Bull Ride + Style events, which brought together both track and freestyle fixed-gear riders from around the world for competitions.

There are also events based on messenger racing, such as Mixpression, which has been held nine times in Tokyo. Trick demonstrations have been held since the late 1800s in the U.S. and Europe; while they continued into a competitive form in Europe (artistic cycling), subsequent to the recent widespread popularity of fixed gear bikes, trick competitions have expanded to the U.S. and Asia. European competitions include solo and team balletic movements on a controlled, flat surface; US and Asian competitions often include &quot;park&quot; and &quot;flatland&quot; styles and venues, a la BMX. Other competitions include games of &quot;foot down&quot; and bike polo.

In 2006, Adventures for the Cure made a documentary film about riding across the United States on fixed gears; they repeated this feat as a 4-man team at the 2008 Race Across America.

Fixed-gear riders sharing the specific philosophy are also seen at the Single Speed World Championships.

==Maintenance and upkeep==

Maintaining a fixed gear is relatively easy because it has fewer parts than a geared bicycle. The sprocket should be checked regularly to make sure there is no damage to any teeth and that no object is grinding it as it turns with the rear wheel. The chainring should be checked similarly for any damage.

There is an advantage to selecting a number of chainring teeth that is not a round multiple of the number of sprocket teeth (e.g. 3) because this avoids coincidence of the same chainring and sprocket teeth, and tyre contact patch, on each of the rider&#x27;s power strokes. For riders who perform brakeless skid-stops, it is best to select prime-numbered chainrings (e.g. 41, 43 or 47 teeth) to guarantee that rear tyre wear is spread evenly.

It is imperative (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight that it is impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. This generally equates to &quot;no visible slack&quot;. A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the pedal spindle and pulls the rear triangle forwards. On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional &quot;full bushing&quot; type with limited lateral flexibility. Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.

As with any other bicycle, the chain should be checked making sure the master link is securely latched. The chain can be lubricated monthly for smooth riding. Also, as needed, the brakes should be tightened as they wear and tire condition observed for possible puncture locations. Air pressure in the tires, tire alignment, brake handle placement, and rust should be monitored on a daily basis because they can change very easily during a jarring ride.

==Subculture==

Fixed-gear bicycles are often associated with the hipster subculture.

===Republic of Korea===
The fixed-gear culture didn&#x27;t catch on in Korea until the 2010s, but since the webtoon &#x27;Wind Breaker&#x27; launched in 2013 they have become popular with middle school and high school students. Unknown Bike, Constantine, and Engine 11 are popular brands.

===Australia===
Until recently, the Australian fixie culture has been small. However, with the strong Australian dollar and cost effective manufacturing and importing from China, Australia has seen many new online stores capitalise on the cheap steel frames commonly imported to the UK and US. Online stores in Australia ship partially-assembled bikes directly to consumers, considerably undercutting prices at typical brick and mortar stores.

===Russia===

====Fixed Gear Moscow====
In 2007, a few activists started assembling and riding fixed gear bikes in Moscow. There had been people riding fixed gear bikes on the street in Moscow prior that time, but it had never developed into any feasible subculture. Appearances of the design in foreign media began increasing around that time, attracting more people to the concept.

A &quot;Fixed Gear Moscow&quot; LiveJournal blog community was formed, which allowed riders to communicate with each other and share ideas for rides. As interest grew, a separate web site was created to host the blog and the forum.

Fixed Gear Moscow has organized numerous alleycat races, tournaments, and other events to keep the community growing. Several side projects have been initiated by members of Fixed Gear Moscow and are still in development.

====Red Bull Fix Boulevard====
In September 2013 Red Bull and Moscow government organized first race for fixed gear bikes in Moscow city center on the Boulevard ring. Distance that participants had to overcome was about 50 kilometers. The race was repeated in 2014.

===Sweden===

==== Community ====
The fixed-gear movement is growing in Sweden. A cornerstone of the Swedish fixed-gear society is the Internet-based forum Fixedgear.se, with over 6000 registered members . This makes up for the main meeting ground and discussion forum for Swedish fixed-gear riders and enthusiasts.

There are also several bicycle clubs throughout Sweden with a fixed-gear niche. Komet Club Rouler is a club based in Gothenburg, annually arranging Svart Katt and other fixed-gear oriented activities. Svart Katt has been internationally recognized and is considered Sweden&#x27;s largest alley cat by number of participators, according to Cog Magazine. KCR&#x27;s equivalent in Malmö is called Pista Malmø, arranging ”Thursday&#x27;s rides” every Thursday, for all bikes and riders. Stockholm also has its own informal fixed gear bicycle club, called Fista Sthlm.

====Popularity factors====
Several factors contribute to the recent rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycle. A rider from Stockholm interviewed for an article about the phenomenon notes that riding a bike imparts a feeling of freedom to the rider. One is free to go wherever one wants, whenever one wants. A sense of belonging is also important; as the rider says, &quot;all who cycle are my friends&quot;. Riders unknown to each other commonly greet each other when on bikes. As in many subcultures, this feeling of belonging is a key factor in recruiting and retaining participants.

The fact that many fixie riders ride brakeless in defiance of local law could also be viewed as a contributing factor to its popularity; it provides an outlet for minor rebellion.

=== United States ===

====California====

California&#x27;s fixed gear community stretches throughout the state with groups in all of the major urban areas that come together for riding and racing. Beginning in the north, Sacramento has a rising fixed-gear community as popular bicycle shops such as The Bicycle Business are beginning to carry fixed gear bikes and groups of riders are forming.

Moving to the Bay Area, San Francisco and San Jose have well established fixed gear communities who host several established races and community rides. Companies such as Chrome Industries, who make bags and apparel catered toward bike messengers and urban cyclists, have been able to rise to worldwide prominence thanks to San Francisco and California&#x27;s biking community. Also, stores such as MASH SF based in San Francisco, and IMINUSD based in San Jose accommodate fixed-gear cyclist specifically with riding gear, parts, and a center for the fixed-gear riding community in their respective cities. MASH SF collaborates with the Italian bicycle manufacturing company, Cinelli, to make several fixed gear bike framesets, including what is known as the Cinelli MASH Histogram. Furthermore, Macaframa is a group of riders from San Francisco who release movies dedicated to fixed-gear riding that encompass the fast-paced lifestyle that comes along with riding fixed.

Lastly, Southern California is home to a very large fixed community, particularly in the greater Los Angeles area. Los Angeles based TRAFIK is a group dedicated to global fixed gear culture, as they boast the motto “TRAFIK is Global Fixed Gear Culture” and work towards bringing the fixed-gear movement to a worldwide audience. Another southern California based crew is SMC. SMC &quot;started out as a group of high school kids needing a name for their crew in 2010 is now the number one blog in the world for all things involving Fixed Gear Freestyle bikes&quot;.

==== New York ====
New York&#x27;s fixed-gear community was largely born out of bicycle messengers in New York City looking for lower maintenance bicycles that were cheaper to acquire. The popularity of fixed-gear bicycles heavily coincides with the number of alleycat races that were taking part in the 2000s, going so far as to hosting exclusively brakeless fixed-gear races.

== Circus bikes ==

A fixed gear bike is also used in the circus arts (artistic cycling). When the saddle and handlebars are at the same height, an acrobat can stand on the handlebars and saddle and perform acrobatic exercises, sometimes involving multiple people, while continuing to circle the circus ring. It can be found as a niche sport in many countries. In addition to better speed control, the use of a fixed gear bike allows the artist to ride the bike backwards and/or only on the back wheel. 

==In popular culture==
The 2012 film &quot;Premium Rush&quot; uses a &quot;fixie&quot; as a running plot device. Wilee, the lead character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, works as a bike messenger in Manhattan, and his fellow riders rib him about his enthusiasm for his fixed-gear steel-frame bike with no brakes. He avoids one confrontation by pedaling the bicycle backward, and he successfully weaves through dangerous traffic, but he also gets into accidents because the fixed-gear style abets his avidity for speed. Wilee says, &quot;I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can&#x27;t stop. Don&#x27;t want to, either.&quot;

In its early years the Tour de France only ever featured bikes with a fixed gear. Once coasting and gears were developed, the Tour founder Henri Desgrange is quoted to have said: “Come on, fellows! Let’s say that the test was a fine demonstration – for our grandparents! As for me: Give me a fixed gear.”

<text>The King&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry (known as Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry when the monarch is female) is awarded for a book of verse published by someone in any of the Commonwealth realms. Originally the award was open only to British subjects living in the United Kingdom, but in 1985 the scope was extended to include people from the rest of the Commonwealth realms. Recommendations to the King for the award of the Medal are made by a committee of eminent scholars and authors chaired by the Poet Laureate. In recent times, the award has been announced on the (traditional date of the) birthday of William Shakespeare, 23 April. However, Don Paterson was awarded the medal alongside the 2010 New Year Honours.

The Gold Medal for Poetry was instituted by King George V in 1933 at the suggestion of the British royal court&#x27;s poet laureate, John Masefield.

The obverse of the medal bears the effigy of the King. The idea of the reverse, which was designed by Edmund Dulac, is: &quot;Truth emerging from her well and holding in her right hand the divine flame of inspiration - Beauty is truth and Truth Beauty&quot;. The latter part of this description recalls &quot;Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty&quot;, from John Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;.

<doc id="996428" wikidata="Q81249" url="?curid=996428" title="Soap Lake">
<text>Soap Lake is a meromictic soda lake in the town of Soap Lake, Washington formed by the Missoula Floods at the foot of the Grand Coulee. The lake gets its name from the naturally occurring foam that gives its water a soapy appearance, and because the lake&#x27;s mineral-rich waters have a slick, soapy feel. The lake is approximately in area and deep.

==Qualities==

Soap Lake&#x27;s mineral-rich waters have long been thought to have medicinal value. In fact, it is said that rival native tribes would call a truce when they came to Soap Lake to relax and heal themselves and their animals. This is verified by recorded history and the number of Native American artifacts found in the area over the years. Washington State tourist guides in the 1920s referred to Soap Lake as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest mineral sea&quot; and people afflicted with Buerger&#x27;s disease said that bathing in the lake cured their illness. The city of Soap Lake bills itself as &quot;Washington&#x27;s Health Resort&quot;.

There are 23 different minerals in Soap Lake water. Water quality assays conducted since 1910 to test the mineral content of Soap Lake water have shown that the mineral content of the lake has declined. Although it is not known what causes the foam, its quantity has declined since the construction of canals linking Soap Lake to upstream lakes and the Grand Coulee Dam. It is now rare to see any foam except on windy days.

However, compared to the ocean and other known naturally occurring mineral resources in the world, Soap Lake still has the highest diverse mineral content of any body of water on the planet. Soap Lake water also contains ichthyols, an oil-like substance sold over the counter in Europe to treat infections and abrasions. The ichthyol in Soap Lake water most likely come from decomposition of tiny brine-like red shrimp that flourish in the water from late spring to mid-summer. Like the Dead Sea, the high mineral content of the lake makes the water very buoyant.

The alkalinity of the lake is similar to that found on the moons of Jupiter. Because of this, in 2002 the National Science Foundation awarded a grant to researchers from Central Washington University to study the lake to learn about the possibility of life on Mars.

==Mineral content==


Less than 0.01 mg/L of aluminum, iron, copper, rubidium, lithium, strontium, barium, chromium, lead, manganese, titanium, vanadium, and boron.

<doc id="996430" wikidata="Q938906" url="?curid=996430" title="Major Ridge">
<text>The Ridge, later known as Major Ridge (c. 1771 – 22 June 1839; known in Cherokee as Nunnehidihi, and later Ganundalegi []) was a Cherokee leader, a member of the tribal council, and a lawmaker. As a warrior, he fought in the Cherokee–American wars against American frontiersmen. Later, Major Ridge led the Cherokee in alliances with General Andrew Jackson and the United States in the Creek and Seminole wars of the early 19th century.

Along with Charles R. Hicks and James Vann, Ridge was part of the &quot;Cherokee triumvirate&quot;, a group of rising younger chiefs in the early nineteenth-century Cherokee Nation who supported acculturation and other changes in how the people dealt with the United States. All identified as Cherokee; they were of mixed race, though Ridge was nearly full blood, and had extensive personal and professional experience and understanding of the European-American culture surrounding the Cherokee homeland. Ridge became a wealthy planter, and ferryman in Georgia. Like many Cherokee leaders, including John Ross with whom he would come to greatly disagree with on how the Cherokee tribe should respond the United States’ passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, Ridge had become a wealthy plantation and slave owner.

Under increasing pressure for removal from the federal government, Ridge and others of the Treaty Party signed the controversial Treaty of New Echota of 1835. They believed removal was inevitable and tried to protect Cherokee rights in the process. It required the Cherokee to cede their remaining lands in the Southeast to the US and to relocate to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Opponents strongly protested to the US government and negotiated a new treaty the following year, but were still forced to accept removal. Blamed for the ceding of communal land and the deaths of the Trail of Tears, Ridge was assassinated in 1839 by members of the Ross faction who believed they were acting in accordance with the Cherokee Blood Law.

==Background==
===Early life===
Ridge was born about 1772 into the Deer clan of his mother, &quot;Oganotota&quot; (O-go-nuh-to-tua), a Scots-Cherokee woman, in the Cherokee town of Great Hiwassee, along the Hiwassee River (an area later part of Tennessee). His father was believed to be full-blood Cherokee. Ridge&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Scots trader who returned to Europe and left a Cherokee wife and daughter behind in America.

Ridge was the third son born, but the first to survive to adulthood. He had two younger brothers, one of whom became known as David Uwatie (father of Stand Watie). From his early years, Ridge was taught patience and self-denial, and to endure fatigue. On reaching the proper age, he was initiated as a warrior. The Cherokee believed that a man&#x27;s achievements as a warrior were a sign of his spiritual power and part of his leadership.

Until the end of the Cherokee – American wars, the young man was known as &quot;Nunnehidihi&quot;, meaning &quot;He Who Slays The Enemy In His Path&quot; or &quot;The Pathkiller&quot; (not the same as another chief of the same name). Later Ridge was named &quot;Ganundalegi&quot; (other spellings include Ca-Nun-Tah-Cla-Kee, Ca-Nun-Ta-Cla-Gee, and Ka-Nun-Tah-Kla-Gee), meaning &quot;The Man Who Walks On The Mountain Top Ridge&quot;. White men knew him by the simplified English name, &quot;The Ridge&quot;.

===Marriage and family===
In 1792, Ridge married &quot;Sehoya,&quot; also known as Suzannah Catherine Wickett, a mixed-blood Cherokee of the Wild Potato clan. Her name was also spelled Sehoyah; she was the daughter of Kate Parris and &quot;Ar-tah-ku-ni-sti-sky&quot; (&quot;Wickett&quot;). The couple had several children, including John Ridge. They sent him in 1819 as a young man to Cornwall, Connecticut, to be educated in European-American classical studies at the Foreign Mission School.

After the Cherokee–American wars, the Ridges lived in the Cherokee town of Oothcaloga. (The modern city of Calhoun, Georgia, developed near here.) About 1819, they moved near the Cherokee town of Chatuga (modern-day Rome) at the confluence of the Oostanaula and Etowah rivers, which forms the Coosa River. Ridge acquired 223 acres that fronted on the Oostanaula River, upstream of the confluence. Starting with a log dogtrot house on the property, Ridge expanded the house to a two-story white frame house with extensions on either end. Like European-American planters, Ridge used enslaved African Americans to work the cotton fields on his plantation. Nearby, Ridge&#x27;s protégé John Ross had established his own home and plantation.

Ridge had no formal education and could neither read nor write. But he was known as a noted orator and dynamic speaker. Ridge appreciated the value of education and believed that the Cherokee must learn to communicate with European Americans and to understand their ways in order to survive as a nation. He sent his son John to a mission boarding school at Springhill.

===Young warrior===
In addition to participating in small raids and other actions, &quot;Nunnehidihi&quot; took part in the attack on Gillespie&#x27;s Station and in Watts&#x27; raids in the winter of 1788–1789; the attack on Buchanan&#x27;s Station in 1792; the campaign against the settlements of Upper East Tennessee in 1793 (that resulted in the massacre and destruction of Cavett&#x27;s Station); and the so-called &quot;Battle of Hightower&quot; at Etowah. (Before the 1793 campaigns, he had taken part in a horse-stealing raid against the Holston River settlements, where two European-American pioneers were killed.)

At age 21, &quot;Nunnehidihi&quot; was chosen as a member of the Cherokee Council. He proved a valuable counselor, and at the second session proposed many useful laws. After the Cherokee–American wars, he changed his name to &quot;Ganundalegi&quot;, which in English was translated as &quot;He Who Walks On The Ridge&quot;.

With the massacre at Cavett&#x27;s Station, a personal feud developed between The Ridge and Chief Doublehead. The latter had promised to spare the post if the three white men who lived there surrendered. But, after the men agreed to surrender, Doublehead changed his mind and ordered that all the inhabitants be killed, including thirteen women and children. This act disgusted The Ridge, who felt it dishonored the tribe. Frontiersmen pursued Ridge&#x27;s band, catching them at Coyatee (near the mouth of the Little Tennessee River). They killed several leading Chickamauga Cherokee and wounded others, including Hanging Maw, the chief headman of the Overhill Towns.

In 1807, Doublehead was bribed by white speculators to cede some Cherokee communal land without approval by the Cherokee National Council. The Council determined this to be a capital crime against the nation, and directed Ridge, James Vann, and Alexander Sanders to execute Doublehead. (Vann became too drunk to participate. The other two men used guns, knives, and a tomahawk to kill the old chief on August 9, 1807, at the Hiwassee Garrison in Tennessee).

Shortly before the War of 1812, Shawnee chief Tecumseh and his brother, &quot;Tenskawatawa&quot; (also called &quot;The Prophet&quot;), came south to recruit other tribes to unite and together prevent the sale of their lands to white immigrants. Tecumseh urged his listeners to reject subservience to the United States, reject the white man&#x27;s agrarian lifestyle, return to their traditional lifestyles, and take up weapons to defend their lands. Ridge attended as an observer when Tecumseh spoke to the Muscogee (Creek) living nearby. Ridge was said to have confronted Tecumseh after the meeting and warned that he would kill the chief if he tried to spread that message to the Cherokee.

===Later life===
Ridge acquired the title &quot;Major&quot; in 1814, during his service leading the Cherokee alongside the United States General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend during the Creek War against the Red Sticks. This was a civil war within the Creek Nation between the Upper Towns and Lower Towns, who differed in their interaction with European Americans versus holding on to tradition. Ridge had joined the campaign as an unofficial militia lieutenant. (Jackson was involved with the larger War of 1812 against Great Britain.) Ridge used Major as his first name for the rest of his life. He also served with Jackson in the First Seminole War in 1818, leading Cherokee warriors on behalf of the US government against the Seminole Indians in Florida. His war achievements added to his stature among the Cherokee.

After the war, Ridge moved his family to the Cherokee town of Head of Coosa (present-day Rome, Georgia). He developed a plantation, owned 30 African-American slaves as laborers, and became a wealthy planter. The plantation consisted of nearly three hundred cleared acres; its main cash crops were corn, tobacco, and cotton. He built his house. Major Ridge also developed and owned a profitable ferry that carried wagons and their teams across the Oostanuaula River. As another business, Ridge founded a trading post in partnership with George Lavender, a white man; the post provided staples and luxury European-American goods such as calico and silk fabrics.

In 1816, Andrew Jackson tried to persuade the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations to sell their lands in the Southeast and move west of the Mississippi River. He was rebuffed by most of the Cherokee chiefs at a council in Mississippi. They told him that he must meet with Chief Pathkiller at a Cherokee council in Turkeytown.

==Cherokee removal==

Ridge had long opposed U.S. government proposals for the Cherokee to sell their lands and remove to the West. But, Georgia efforts to suppress the Cherokee government and the pressure of rapidly expanding European-American settlements caused him to change his mind. Advised by his son John Ridge, Major Ridge came to believe the best way to preserve the Cherokee Nation was to get good terms from the U.S. government and preserve their rights in Indian Territory.

On December 29, 1835, Ridge made his mark on the Treaty of New Echota, which ceded the remainder of Cherokee tribal land east of the Mississippi River for land in Indian Territory, to be supplemented by the payment of annuities for a period of time, plus support from the government in terms of supplies, tools and food. The tribe was bitterly divided over this decision. Reportedly, Ridge said as he finished, &quot;I have signed my death warrant.&quot;

The National Party of Chief John Ross and a majority of the Cherokee National Council rejected the treaty, but it was ratified by the US Senate. The next year Ross negotiated changes with the US government, but essentially Cherokee removal was confirmed.

Ridge, his family, and many other Cherokee emigrated to the West in March 1837. The treaty had been signed in December 1835 and was amended and ratified in March 1836. Georgia illegally put Cherokee lands in a lottery and auctioned them off even before the Cherokee removal date; settlers started arriving and squatting on Cherokee-occupied land. Georgia supported the settlers against the Cherokee. After 1838, the US government forcibly rounded up the remaining Cherokee (along with their slaves) on tribal lands. They were the last of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast to make the journey that became known as the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;, during which nearly 4,000 Cherokee died.

Accompanied by his wife, daughter, and one of son John&#x27;s children, Major Ridge traveled by flatboat and steamer to a place in Indian Territory called Honey Creek, near the Arkansas-Missouri Border. The land Ridge had chosen was fifty miles from the territory assigned to the Cherokee. He no longer wished to live among his people. His son John Ridge and Major Ridge&#x27;s cousin Elias Boudinot followed six months later.

==Execution==
In the West, the Ross faction blamed Ridge and the other signers of the Treaty of New Echota for the 4,000 deaths along the trail in the Removal, as well as the loss of communal lands, which was held to be a capital crime. In June 1839, Major Ridge and nephew Elias Boudinot, were executed in accordance with the Cherokee Blood Law by members of the Ross faction. Ridge was killed while riding along a road, a group of five men waited with rifles in bushes under trees firing several gunshots at him, with five bullets piercing his head and body leaving the body slumped in saddle.

The Ross faction also tried to kill Ridge&#x27;s nephew Stand Watie, but he survived. Other Treaty Party members were later killed, starting a wave of violence within the nation.

Among Ridge&#x27;s killers was Bird Doublehead. Ridge had killed his father Chief Doublehead under orders by the Cherokee National Council. Another of his killers was James Foreman, Bird&#x27;s half-brother. In 1842 Stand Watie, Ridge&#x27;s nephew, killed Foreman. In 1845 opponents killed his younger brother, Thomas Watie. The cycle of retaliatory violence within the Cherokee resulted in the deaths of all the other Watie family males of that generation. Stand Watie survived the violence of the 1840s, when the Cherokee conflict descended into virtual civil war. In the 1850s, Watie was tried in Arkansas for Foreman&#x27;s murder, but he was acquitted on grounds of self-defense; he was defended by his brother Elias Cornelius Boudinot.

Tribal divisions were exacerbated by the outbreak of the American Civil War. Many Cherokee supported the Confederacy, despite the Southern governments having pushed them out. The Confederacy officials now said they would recognize an independent Indian state if successful in creating an independent nation. Stand Watie served as Principal Chief (1862-1866) of the pro-Confederate Cherokee after Ross and many Union-supporters withdrew to another location. He served as a Confederate general and was the last to surrender to Union troops.

==Burial==
Ridge and his son John are buried in Polson Cemetery in Delaware County, Oklahoma. After his nephew Stand Watie died later of natural causes, he was buried near them.

==Legacy==
*Major Ridge&#x27;s home was bought and preserved by the Junior League of Rome in the 1960s. It was opened to visitors in 1971 as the Chieftains Museum. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, renamed to include &quot;Major Ridge Home&quot; in the title. It is listed as one of the sites on the Cherokee Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, administered by the National Park Service.
*Ridge&#x27;s life and the Trail of Tears are dramatized in Episode 3 of Ric Burns&#x27; documentary, &quot;We Shall Remain&quot; (2009), which recounts Native American history in the United States from the 17th into the 20th century, as part of the &quot;American Experience&quot; programs on PBS.

<text>Carrickmacross () is a town in County Monaghan, Ireland. The population was 5,745 at the 2022 census, making it the second-largest town in the county. Carrickmacross is a market town which developed around a castle built by the Earl of Essex in 1630. The town is 20km west of Dundalk and 75km north-north-west of Dublin city centre and 106km south west of Belfast. Carrickmacross won the European Entente Florale Silver Medal Award in 1998. 

==History==
===Foundation and development===
Carrickmacross is a market town which developed around a castle built by the Earl of Essex in 1630. The Convent of St Louis now stands on the original castle site, as the castle itself was destroyed in the late 17th century during the Williamite Wars.

The town developed further as a market town during the 18th century, and a number of large municipal and religious buildings were built to serve the growing population during the 19th century. The town experienced population decline in mid- to late-19th century, during the Great Famine, with the population decreasing from 2,063 in 1861 to 1,779 inhabitants by 1891. The town&#x27;s Poor Law Union Workhouse and Fever Hospital were built in this period - the latter later becoming the offices of the Urban District Council which was originally formed in 1899.

===Built heritage===
Among the historic buildings in the town is the Roman Catholic church which was completed in 1866 and is dedicated to Saint Joseph. It contains ten stained-glass windows which were designed by the artist Harry Clarke in 1925. The town&#x27;s Church of Ireland church, dedicated to Saint Finbarr, is older, and was built c.1770 before being remodelled c.1845.

Magheross Church, located on the outskirts of the town, is also of historical interest, and originally dates from c.1550. Other notable buildings include the Carrickmacross Courthouse (built in 1837) and the restored Poor Law Union Workhouse (built in 1841).

The grave of Patrick Byrne (1794–1863), the last major exponent of the Gaelic harp and the first Irish traditional musician ever photographed, is in the area.

===Lacemaking===

The town is known for the lace bearing its name. Carrickmacross lace is worked in an individual style, devised by Mrs Grey Porter, wife of the rector of Donaghmoyne, who introduced it in 1820. When she left the district the teaching of Carrickmacross lacemaking was continued by Miss Reid of Rahans, but it was only after the Great Famine in 1846, when a lace school was set up by the managers of the Bath and Shirley estates at Carrickmacross as a means of helping their starving tenants, that the lace became known and found sales.

Subsequently, the lacemaking declined, but in the last decade of the 19th century the Sisters of St Louis founded their own lace school to revive the craft, and this was quite profitable for several years. Although the outbreak of the 1914–18 war marked the virtual end of commercial production of hand-made lace in Europe, the lace school kept the technique alive throughout most of the 20th century. In 1984 the St Louis Sisters assisted in the formation of the Carrickmacross Lace Co-operative, which maintains the tradition to this day.

===Luftwaffe attack===
Although Ireland was neutral during World War Two, there were some incidents during the period. On 20 December 1940, as well as two bombs falling on Sandycove in Dublin, two more fell on Shantonagh near Carrickmacross, causing minor damage to house property.

==Transport==
Carrickmacross railway station opened on 31 July 1886, the terminus of a branch from the Dundalk–Enniskillen line at Inniskeen. The station, and the branch, closed to passengers on 10 March 1947, but remained open for goods traffic until final closure on 1 January 1960.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
There are three primary schools in Carrickmacross:
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Boys National School, situated near St. Macartan&#x27;s Villas, is an all-boys national school which was previously run by the Patrician Brothers.
* Bunscoil Lughaidh Naofa, which is in Cloughvalley, is an all-girls school, was run by the St. Louis nuns who came to Carrickmacross in 1888.
* Scoil Rois is a Gaelscoil (an Irish language-medium school) in Carrickmacross. It is a mixed school that, having moved from the Convent Avenue, now occupies newer premises built across from Bunscoil Lughaidh Naofa.

===Secondary schools===
The Patrician High School (or PHS) is one of three secondary schools in Carrickmacross. It was set up by the Patrician Brothers, and was previously situated next to the Church on O&#x27;Neills street; that building is now the Scout Hall. It moved to Rockdaniel Road in 1970, and a new extension was opened in 2007. As of 2015 it had approximately 500 pupils enrolled.

Inver College, called the TEC by students and townspeople due to its being a technological school, is a mixed school situated on the Castleblayney Road. As of 2019, it had approximately 320 students enrolled. Inver College won the U16 VEC GAA County Championship for the second consecutive year in January 2011.

St. Louis Convent is an all-girls secondary school set up by the St. Louis nuns in the 19th century. There were approximately 570 pupils enrolled in the school as of 2017. The school was set up in honour of St. Louis (Louis IX of France). The motto of the school is &quot;Ut Sint Unum&quot;, Latin for &#x27;that they may be one&#x27;. The school is situated on the Convent Avenue.

==Town twinning==

Carrickmacross is twinned with the commune of Carhaix, Brittany, in France.

==Governance and politics==
Carrickmacross town council elects 9 members and is responsible for the provision of local services. At the last local elections in 2009 three members were elected from Fine Gael and two each from Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. It forms part of the five-seat Carrickmacross Local Electoral Area for elections for Monaghan County Council.

In February 2010, the town council voted 5:4 to remove a page signed by the Israeli ambassador from the town&#x27;s visitors&#x27; book in response to the illegal use of Irish passports by agents of Mossad in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.

==Sport==
Carrickmacross Emmets is the local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club. The local soccer team is Carrick Rovers. The town&#x27;s basketball club, Carrick Cruisers, competes in competitions organised by Basketball Ireland.

<text>Crisson Mine was a gold mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia, USA, located just east of Dahlonega. Like many mines in the area, the property probably started as a placer mine during the Georgia Gold Rush. Once the placer deposits had been exhausted, an open pit gold mine was established in 1847 and commercial operations continued until the early 1980s. A small stamp mill was also established here. Much of the gold used for the gold leaf dome of the Georgia State Capitol was mined at this mine, which was among the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt. The mine is located just north of the site of the Consolidated Mine, which is itself north of the Calhoun Mine. 

In 1969, the owners of Crisson Mine opened to the public to allow tourists to pan for gold. The ore sold for panning is still crushed by the stamp mill, which is now well over 100 years old. It is likely that panning the ore provided at the mine will yield small amounts of gold (flakes, specks, small nuggets).

<text>Angoche is a district, city and municipality located in Nampula Province in north-eastern Mozambique. The district has limits in the North with Mogincual District, in the South with Larde District, to the east with the Indian Ocean and to the west with Mogovolas District. The principal town is Angoche. It is located 185 km from the provincial capital, Nampula City.

==History==
=== Arab Explorers ===

Before the arrival of Vasco de Gama in 1498, and according to local oral tradition, the Archipelago of Angoche, made up of several islands, was inhabited by a community that was part of the Swahili, on the East African coast. The dominant groups in the region, the Anhapakhos, were members of the Shiraz family, which allegedly reached the islands of Angoche and Quiloa Island (in present-day Tanzania) whose sultans were also Shirazis, originating from the port of Shiraz, located on the Persian side of the Persian Gulf. One of the founders of the reigning family of the Sultanate of Angoche was Hasani, who died at sea and was buried on the island that was later named after him, Kisiwa Sultani Hasani (known as Ilha de Mafamede by the Portuguese). According to Duarte Barbosa, who wrote in 1508, the habits, customs and language of the inhabitants of the islands of Angoche were similar to those of the Ilha de Moçambique.

At the time of the arrival of the first islamic explorers, whom the Portuguese called “&quot;Moors&quot;”, the &quot;Marundos&quot; peoples, descendants of the Amacúas, already inhabited the lands of Angoche. According to oral accounts, this people had already been constituted before the first Bantu incursion. The story goes that two important men with the names Mussa and Hassan, accompanied by their relatives and slaves, left Zanzibar following religious differences and headed for and settled in Ilha de Moçambique. One day, Hassan, intending to reach the mainland of Mozambique, in the Angoche Bay region, was surprised by a strong storm, ending up losing his life when he fell into the sea. Hassan was buried in the nearest place which was the Mafamede island. Notifying Mussa of Hassan&#x27;s death, he went to the site to see Hassan&#x27;s tomb, having boarded the village of &quot;Mialule&quot;, now &quot;Melule&quot;. Arrived at Mafamede where Hassan had been buried and, having Mussa liked the place, there he left his son Xosa who chose Muchelele, a place close to Hassan&#x27;s tomb, to establish his residence and where he started to govern with the title of Sultan. (See Angoche Sultanate for more information.) They are some of Xosa&#x27;s children who give rise to the population of Catamoio which, in turn, gives rise to the Village of Angoche.

=== Portuguese Colonial and Occupation Resistance ===
In 1863, the land was conquered from the Portuguese by Sultan Mussa, supported by slave traders. Until the mid-19th century, the Portuguese were unable to control or settle on the islands or mainland of Angoche. The situation changed when one of the members of the royal family of the Angoche Islands, Mussa Mohammad Sahib Quanto (d. 1879), decided to attack the deadlines of Macanja da Costa, belonging to the Silva brothers, because of the dispute over the control of the roads of flow of slaves from the interior to the coast.

The Portuguese went to support the da Silvas and a small military detachment of about twenty elements came to occupy the island in 1861, together with João Bonifácio da Silva, one of the Silva brothers. The pleasure people, after taking revenge on the Anhapakhos, had no interest in settling on the islands and returned to their land. Consequently, Mussa Quanto recovered the island, where he was installed as sultan and the few Portuguese present were expelled. From the beginning of the &quot;effective occupation&quot; of Africa, which had a decisive start in 1895, the islands of Angoche suffered repeated assaults by the Portuguese. Then the other member of the Angoche royal family, Omar bin Nacogo Farallahi (known as Farelay by the Portuguese), along with Sultan Ibrahim and his allies, the mainland Macuas, led the resistance that lasted until 1910, when Massano de Amorim and other Portuguese officers managed to conquer the region militarily.

After taking the island in 1861, the Portuguese created the modern settlement (decree dated 05.07.1865), whose charter was approved in the mid-twentieth century (Ordinance No. 11.585 of 04.08.1956, when the town was supplied with water). The evolution of the administrative process of Angoche then went through the following stages throughout the 19th century: seat of circumscription on July 30, 1921, and county seat on October 31, 1934; it elevated the village on December 19, 1934 and the city on September 26, 1970. Although the Portuguese continued to administer the region from one of the islands of Angoche (Quiloa), there was already a small Portuguese population in Parapato, in part mainland.

From the beginning of the 1930s, at the time of the Estado Novo, the mainland Angoche region became one of the centers of cashew and rice production, in addition to traditional fishing, which already existed on the coast. The Portuguese identified the Puli area, where the Africans lived, as the best continental part of Parapato. Consequently, the Africans were resettled in the Bairro de Inguri, created at this time, and in Puli the European masonry village called + was built. The urban evolution can be followed through the municipal edition Planta da Vila de António Enes (esc. 1/5,000), dated 1958, in which the elementary grid that makes up the town on the coast is drawn. The 20th century urbanization plans or studies date from 1924, 1932 and 1965 (the latter being authored by the architect Bernardino Ramalhete and revised by Hidrotécnica Portuguesa in 1972). In 1968 and 1972, the colonial government, concerned about the spread of liberation movements in northern Mozambique, carried out several measures aimed at winning Muslims to its side, although many of them were also related to the policies of decentralization of the Portuguese government from 1971, which allowed the channeling of new funds to the colonies. This resulted in an improvement in the quality of life of the African population, including basic sanitation and the construction of masonry neighborhoods for Africans, including the Bairro de Inguri, in the city of Angoche. At the same time, the Portuguese government restored some important historic mosques and built new ones, such as the Mosque of Catamoio, on one of the islands of Angoche, inaugurated by General Kaúlza de Arriaga in 1971. Monuments and Statues The Monument to António is highlighted Enes, simple bust on a pedestal, in front of the City Hall (built before 1954). It was built as a &quot;homage to the population of the county&quot;, as one could read in the inscription on its base, which consists of a prismatic stone volume with two buttresses, also in stone, on each side.

Angoche was one of the most important socio-economic centers in the region. With the proclamation of National Independence, in February 1976, the city of António Enes was renamed Angoche. In 1997 the city is elevated to the category of City Municipality, under Law 10/97 of 31 May.

== Geography ==

=== Neighboring Districts ===
Angoche District is limited by:

* Mogincual District to the north
* The Indian Ocean to the east
* Mogovolas District to the west
* Larde District to the south

=== Climate and Geomorphology ===
The south eastern Nampula towards the northern coastal region of Zambézia, including the coastal districts of Angoche, Larde, Moma and Pebane, the average annual rainfall returns to values between 800 and 1,000 mm, although the potential evapotranspiration is higher than the 1,500 mm. The temperature is generally above 20 °C.

The coastal plains in the region are dissected by some rivers that ascend from the coast to the interior, gradually passing to a more dissected relief with more steep slopes in between, from the transitional subplateau zone to the coastal zone. This zone corresponds to the coastal area of the province. It is characterized by its sandy soils, washed to moderately washed, predominantly yellow to greyish-brown, whether in the inland sandy cover (Ferralic Arenosols) or in the coastal sandy dunes (Haplic Arenosols), and also by the soils of the strip of coastal sandstone, from sandy to loam sandy clay loam with orange color (Ferralic Arenosols). The hydromorphic sandy soils of depressions and lows alternate with the higher ground parts (Gleyic Arenosols).

==Demographics==
The following statistics are from the 2017 census.

=== Population and Density ===
In the 2017 census the population has increased to 341,176 with the rise of density to 101.8 inhabitants per km².

In 2007, the Census indicated total population of 276 471 residents. The population density was around 92.59 inhabitants per km². According to the 1997 Census, the district had 228,526 inhabitants, resulting in a population density of 76.5 inhabitants per km².

=== Gender ===
== Administrative and political units ==

=== Subdivisions ===
The Angoche district is divided into four administrative posts: Angoche, Aube, Boila-Nametoria and Namaponda. These posts are, in turn, composed of the following localities.
=== Political leadership / Government ===
The district government is represented by an Administrator, which is the highest local government rank. Since 1975, 9 District Administrators have been appointed by different Mozambique Presidents:

* (2009 - 2016) Fonseca Etide
* (2005 - 2009) José Carlos Amade

== Economy ==

=== Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery ===
Agriculture is one of the most dominant activity in Angoche and involves almost all households. In general, agriculture is practiced manually on a small scale farms or family farms.

The farm plantation mechanism is based on the intercropping of local crops. Agricultural production is predominantly done under rainfed conditions, not always successful, as the risk of crop loss is high, given the low moisture storage capacity in the soil during the growing period of the crops. There are also small irrigation infrastructures with the capacity to carry out surface irrigation and dams with the potential to irrigate small agricultural areas. The coastal strip is dominated by the production system based on the cultivation of cassava, intercropped with grain legumes such as cowpea and peanut. Upland rice is the crop produced in the alluvial plains of the main rivers that drain the coast and estuarine plains, and is normally produced in floodplains prepared for this purpose.

It is also worth mentioning the importance of coconut and cashew trees in the coastal zone&#x27;s production system, either as a product that guarantees food security or as a source of income for rural families. The cashew agroforestry system is the most representative, even becoming dominant. The most important intercropping of cashew, comprises crops such as cassava and corn, following the traditional pattern of rotation and fallow in the medium and long term, depending heavily on the age of the cashew trees and their productivity. A peculiarity of the area is that practically all the cassava is within the cashew tree area. The coconut palm in the province has a wide distribution towards the interior. It was only in 2003, after the period of drought and drought that followed and the rehabilitation of some infrastructures, that farming in the district was timidly restarted and production levels recovered. Livestock promotion in the district has been weak. However, given the tradition in raising cattle and some existing infrastructure, there was some growth in the livestock population.

Due to limited investing and financing mechanism the livestock is not well developed, although the existence of pasture areas. Lack of extension services is also one of the main obstacles to its development.

Mangrove trees are used for firewood and building material. The district is struggling with erosion problems. Wildlife is an important food supplement for local families. Among the most hunted species are rabbits, gazelles and guinea fowl. In addition to the species already mentioned, the wildlife in the district also includes antelopes and monkeys.

Fishing in the district is more focused on shrimp, to the detriment of other species and valuable resources consisting of lobster, squid, octopus and crab. There are two fishing companies in the district, Pesca Norte and Mawipi Pescas.

=== Commerce. Industries And Tourism ===
The Angoche district already had a very important agro-industry activity. Today, of the 12 companies in the district&#x27;s industrial park, only 3 are operational. The small local industry (fishing, carpentry and handicraft) appears as an alternative to agricultural activity, or extension of its activity. The district has a total of 22 small industries. The district has access to an extensive network of markets, due to its road links with Nampula and the Nacala corridor, and the existence of the port in Angoche. Traders from Nampula, Cabo Delgado and Tanzania come to the district to buy local products. The district has excellent areas for tourism, including the following: Praia Nova, 7 km from the city of Angoche; Monte Parapato, Praia da Rocha, Quelelene Island, Mafamede Island, among others. Other local attractions to mention are the Municipal Cemetery, Campo do Sultão Hassane Yossufo, the Cadeia Civil Building, the Sangaje lighthouse and the Luís de Gonzaga Church in Malatane.

=== Mineral Resources ===
Like other districts in the country, Angoche has enormous potential in different types of mineral resources, among others. Since colonial times, Angoche has been the target of prospecting, research and geological mapping programs in order to identify its potential.

According to the geological studies, Angoche has huge quantities of heavy (Zircon, Ilmenite, Rutile, titanium) minerals deposits along of its coastal plain. This mineral are currently been explored by a consortium of companies from China, Ireland and the United States. And as per mining catalogue (2021), except 1 for the limestone exploration license, most of them (16) are designated for heavy mineral exploration. Although there are many companies in exploration and licensing phase, its importante to mention one of the key players exploring and producing the heavy sands in Angoche district are Kenmare Resources (An Irish-American Enterprise), África Great Wall Mining Development Co(Chinese), a subsidiary of Hainan Haiyu Mining Co. Ltd.

=== Oil and Gas ===
Following the public tender launched by INP in October 2014, for the concession of areas for exploration and production of hydrocarbons, 2 offshore blocks was awarded in October 2018 to multinational oil companies. Area A5-A awarded to a consortium led by Eni 34.5%(Italy), in partnership with, Sasol 25.5%(South Africa), QatarEnergy 25.5% (Qatar) and National Oil Company ENH 15% (Mozambique); while the deeper Area A5-B was awarded to ExxonMobil 40% (USA), Roseneft 20%(Russia), QatarEnergy 10% (Qatar), Eni 10% (Italy), and National Oil Company ENH 20% (Mozambique). Along the 8 years of exploration period, the companies are obliged to implement exploration programs with consists of shooting 3D seismic surveys of 8,000 km2 from each area and undertake at least 1 exploration drilling activities in each area before any surrender and abandonment. According to local authorities, the preliminary studies indicate that the offshore Angoche is an oil-pron province, for this reason the local communities, provincial and central government is very positive about the project.

In 2019, both Eni and ExxonMobil along with environmental consulting companies have visited the districts and neighboring regions in order to fulfil all the requirements for environmental permit for drilling activities to take place in Q1 2022.

=== Sustainability ===
Firewood and charcoal are the most used energy sources.

<text>Jacob Steinhardt (1887–1968) () was a German-born Israeli painter and woodcut artist.

==Biography==

Jacob Steinhardt was born in Zerkow, German Empire (now Żerków, Poland). He attended the School of Art in Berlin in 1906, then studied painting with Lovis Corinth and engraving with Hermann Struck in 1907. From 1908 to 1910 he lived in Paris, where he associated with Henri Matisse and Théophile Steinlen, and in 1911 he was in Italy. When World War I broke out, he enlisted in the German Army, and served on the Eastern Front in Poland and Lithuania, and then in Macedonia. After the war, he returned to Berlin, and in 1922 married Minni Gumpert. They immigrated to Palestine in 1933, after he was harassed by the German police, dominated by the Nazis who recently came to power.

Steinhardt died in 1968. He is buried in Nahariya.

==Artistic career==
Jacob Steinhardt worked mainly in woodcuts depicting biblical and Jewish subjects. He participated in the Berlin Secession and founded the Pathetiker Group. He was a member of the Bezalel school group. In 1934, Steinhardt opened an art school in Jerusalem. In 1948, he became Chairman of the Graphics Department at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. He served as director of the school in 1954–1957.

==Collections==
The Jewish Museum Berlin houses the largest Steinhardt collection in the world, including numerous graphic artworks and unpublished documents donated by Josefa Bar-On Steinhardt, the artist&#x27;s daughter. The museum owns paintings, several hundred print graphics, and a collection of books illustrated by the artist.
It is also possible to discover some of his work at the Jewish Museum Frankfurt and at the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in Basel.

<text>The Pawcatuck River is a river in the US states of Rhode Island and Connecticut flowing approximately . There are eight dams along the river&#x27;s length. was named after the river.

==History==
The river was specified as the western boundary of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in the original charter of 1663. It was formerly called the Charles River between its source and the mouth of the Wood River near Bradford, Rhode Island.

On April 20, 2006, an Atlantic white-sided dolphin swam several miles up the river to Westerly, Rhode Island, from Little Narragansett Bay at the east end of Fishers Island Sound. It spent several hours at Westerly-Pawcatuck, near the bridge connecting Rhode Island and Connecticut, while several hundred spectators gathered to see it. According to the Mystic Aquarium, the dolphin may have become separated from its pod at sea and had been searching for it. It was captured and taken later that night to the aquarium, where it died; it had become sick, underweight, and bruised during its journey upriver.

The Pawcatuck River flooded during a fierce rainstorm in New England on March 29, 2010, with waters overflowing into both Westerly and Pawcatuck. Both towns evacuated low-lying areas, and some historic buildings were lost to flood damage along the course of the river, and its tributaries such as a 150-year-old general store in North Stonington adjacent to the Shunock River. The bridge in downtown Westerly-Pawcatuck was closed for several weeks until the river had gone down enough for divers to inspect it for safety.

==Course==
The Pawcatuck River&#x27;s source is Worden Pond in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. It proceeds generally west and southwest through the villages of Kenyon, Carolina, and Bradford, Rhode Island. It serves as the border between the towns of Charlestown and Richmond, Rhode Island, Charlestown and Hopkinton, Rhode Island, and Hopkinton and Westerly. It turns briefly northwest and west before resuming a southward course to flow past Potter Hill, Rhode Island and between the towns of Westerly, Rhode Island and the Pawcatuck section of Stonington, Connecticut; its mouth is on Little Narragansett Bay on Long Island Sound ().

<doc id="996445" wikidata="Q638781" url="?curid=996445" title="Ardee">
<text>Ardee (; , ) is a town and townland in County Louth, Ireland. It is located at the intersection of the N2, N52, and N33 roads. The town shows evidence of development from the thirteenth century onward but as a result of the continued development of the town since then much of the fabric of the medieval town has been removed. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

Ardee is on the banks of the River Dee and is equidistant between the county&#x27;s two biggest towns - approximately from Dundalk and Drogheda, while it is also close to Slane and Carrickmacross.

In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Ardee increased by approximately 30%, from 3,791 to 4,928 inhabitants. By 2022, it had a population of 5,478.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Originally called &quot;Atherdee&quot;, the towns name is from (the Ford of Ferdia) which itself is derived from the fabled four-day battle between Cúchulainn and Ferdia, for the defence of Ulster from Queen Maeve of Connacht. It is said Ferdia fell after four days of battle, and is buried on the southern banks of the river alongside the Riverside Walk. A depiction of the pair is located on Bridge Street in the town as a bronze statue. The River Dee was originally named in but took on the final element of the town&#x27;s name in English usage.

Ardee is an example of a medieval &quot;walled town&quot;, a number of which can be found across Ireland. The town itself is situated in the southern part of the ancient territory known as the Plain of Muirheimhne. The town lies along the 15th-century Pale frontier between Dundalk and Kells.

The town comprises the townlands or town parks – the greater portion of which is made up of Ardee bog, and a small portion of Dawson&#x27;s Demesne, which takes in the southeastern quadrant of the town on the northern side of the River Dee.

Ardee received its royal charter from King Henry V in 1414.

=== Smith schools ===
A philanthropic trust founded by Erasmus Smith in the 17th century funded the establishment of a boys&#x27; school in 1806 and a girls&#x27; school in 1817. Both Protestant and Catholic children were allowed to attend. At the time there were other schools but in 1824 they became the sole schools in the area. The Smith schools amalgamated into a combined-sex establishment by 1858, by which time the National School movement was leading to the creation of denominational schools there. The school remained a non-denominational institute but the school decreased in numbers and in 1868 had a roll of only 16 Protestant boys. It was fully integrated into the National School system in 1954, when it became known as Saint Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland National School.

== Administration ==
Ardee is in the local government area of Louth County Council. Members of the council are elected from five local electoral areas in the county. The Ardee local electoral area returns six of the council&#x27;s 29 members, who sit as the Ardee Municipal District. As of the 2024 local elections, the members included:

Ardee had a corporation first mentioned in a charter of 1378. An electorate of 24 burgesses and 80 freemen elected two MPs for the parliamentary borough of Ardee to the Irish House of Commons. It was disfranchised under the Acts of Union 1800. The corporation was abolished by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.

== Media ==
Newspapers include the Mid-Louth Independent, a regional edition of the Drogheda Independent newspaper, which is published weekly. It is distributed and sold in Ardee, Collon, Dunleer and Tallanstown. The Dundalk Democrat is the regional edition of the weekly newspaper, which covers Ardee and its surroundings.

LMFM Radio is the local radio station for the North East covering Ardee as well as the rest of Louth, Meath, Monaghan and North Dublin.

== Transport ==
Ardee railway station, previously serving the town, was linked to the main Belfast–Dublin line at Dromin Junction station, along a five-mile (8 km) long branch line. Ardee railway station opened on 1 August 1896 and passenger services ended on 3 June 1934. The line continued as a freight service until finally closed on 3 November 1976, serving the local fertiliser factory, sugar beet and livestock transport. The trackbed was lifted in the late 1980s, and much of the short route is now a designated walkway.

Ardee&#x27;s transport network consists of the N2, which runs directly through the town, and the M1 motorway, which is connected to Ardee through a bypass/link road the N33. The N52, which connects the M7 at Nenagh to the M1 at Dundalk, passes through the town serving a southwest-northeast link from Limerick to Belfast without going near Dublin and the M50.

==Religion==
Ardee is in the Roman Catholic parish of Ardee and Collon which lies in the Archdiocese of Armagh in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh.

In April 2021, the Traditionalist Catholic Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest purchased a former convent building in Ardee, for the use of its own nuns; the Sisters Adorers.

== Culture ==
=== Built heritage ===
==== Ardee Castle ====

Ardee&#x27;s identity as a walled town is further enhanced by surviving medieval buildings and some of the features that survive within the town, including the intact medieval street pattern and the castle itself. Previously known as St. Leger&#x27;s Castle, Ardee Castle is the largest fortified medieval tower house in Ireland. Built circa 15th century, the castle was used as a prison during the 17th and 18th centuries, before going on to become Ardee&#x27;s district courthouse until June 2006 when a specialised facility was built as it &quot;could no longer meet the official needs of court users in the 21st century&quot;.

==== Chantry College ====
Founded a short time prior to 1487, &quot;Chantry College&quot; consists of a gabled tower, four storeys in height, which has an adjoining two-storey hall to the north. Although the structure was defensible, it is not classified as a fortified townhouse. It was an ecclesiastical building, and as such differs from the two castles in the town. The small section of the original building shares similarities to another surviving building in Howth, Dublin.

==== Hatch&#x27;s Castle ====
A gift given to the Hatch family by Oliver Cromwell, Hatch&#x27;s Castle is still in use as a private family home and as a bed and breakfast. A late 14th-century urban fortified house, it is the older of the town&#x27;s two castles. It was modernised in the 19th century with large windows placed in the east and west faces. The southern corner has a projecting turret which houses a spiral stairway to roof level.

==== Jumping Church of Kildemock ====

The Jumping Church of Kildemock (&quot;also known as Millockstown Church)&quot; is a tourist attraction in Ardee which claims to be an &quot;unsolved mystery&quot;. The site was restored in 1954 after the site was cleared of debris by archaeologists the previous year. Legend surrounding the church states that a non-Christian was believed to be buried inside the church walls in 1715, and that the church &quot;jumped&quot; later that night to leave his remains outside of the sacred grounds.

A plaque on the site reads:&quot;This wall by its pitch, tilt and position can be seen to have moved three feet from its foundation. Contemporary accounts mention a severe storm in 1715 when the wall was lifted and deposited as it now stands but local tradition states that the wall jumped inwards to exclude the grave of an excommunicated person.&quot;
All that remains at Kildemock today is a small ruin, containing the wall that for a reason unknown moved three feet. It is believed to be caused by a storm but this cannot be confirmed.
==== Nativity of our Lady Church ====
The church is a detached multi-bay Roman Catholic church, built in 1974. The church replaced a previously existing Catholic church built in 1829, which is now derelict.

It is a post-Vatican II church, designed by Guy Moloney and Associates. The leaded light clerestory windows introduce colour to what is otherwise a plain interior.

==== Saint Mary&#x27;s Church ====
Built in the early 19th century on the site of an earlier church, St Mary&#x27;s Church was substantially repaired and rebuilt preserving portions of a tower belonging to a previous church. This site has been the focus of Christian worship for at least eight hundred years.

=== Arts and festivals ===

Founded in 1860, Ardee Concert Band is the third oldest concert band in Ireland.

Ardee has an annual St Patrick&#x27;s Parade on 17 March. The first parade began in Ardee in 1962 and has run almost every year since then, exceptions include 2001&#x27;s cancellation due to the foot-and-mouth crisis, 2020&#x27;s cancellation due to COVID-19.

Since 2004, the town has hosted the Ardee Baroque Festival, which includes performances by the Irish Baroque Orchestra and others. The &quot;Turfman Festival&quot;, launched in Ardee in 2009, was held on the August bank holiday weekend and included a number of community events and a Festival Queen competition. The festival was last held in 2013.

== Education ==
Ardee has one secondary school, Ardee Community School, which opened in 1974. The school was an amalgamation of three schools that had previously existed independently; St. Anne&#x27;s Convent of Mercy, De La Salle Brothers&#x27; School and the Vocational School. As of 2019, the school had a student body of around 890.

There are three primary schools in the town: Monastery Boys National School, Scoil Mhuire na Trocaire Girls School and Ardee Educate Together. Ardee Educate Together is a multi-cultural primary school for both girls and boys. Ballapousta National School is located just outside the town and (as of early 2020) had approximately 220 pupils. As of 2014, the Monastery Boys National School had approximately 250 pupils enrolled, while the Scoil Mhuire na Trocaire Girls School and the Educate Together School had 290 and 150 pupils respectively as of early 2020.

<doc id="996451" wikidata="Q7567226" url="?curid=996451" title="South Florida">
<text>South Florida, sometimes colloquially shortened to SoFlo, is the southernmost region of the U.S. state of Florida. It is one of Florida&#x27;s three most commonly referred to directional regions; the two others are Central Florida and North Florida. South Florida is the southernmost part of the continental United States and the only region of the continental U.S. that includes some areas with a tropical climate.

South Florida is dominated by the Miami metropolitan area and the Everglades. It also contains the Florida Keys; three U.S. national parks: Biscayne, Dry Tortugas, and Everglades; and multiple cities.

==Composition==
As with all vernacular regions, South Florida has no official boundaries or status and is defined differently by different sources. A 2007 study of Florida&#x27;s regions by Ary Lamme and Raymond K. Oldakowski found that Floridians surveyed identified &quot;South Florida&quot; as comprising the southernmost sections of peninsular Florida, meaning from Jupiter, Florida south. That area includes the Miami metropolitan area, defined as Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, the Florida Keys, and the interior region known as the Glades. 

The term South Florida most commonly refers to the Miami metro’s tri-county area, interpretations vary on the inclusion of some other parts of Florida within the South Florida region, such as the inclusion of Southwest Florida and the Treasure Coast. Southwest Florida, representing the state&#x27;s Gulf Coast, has emerged as a directional vernacular region. Respondents from as far northwest as the Tampa Bay area identified their region as being in Central Florida. Confusing the matter further, the University of South Florida, named in part because of its status as the state&#x27;s southernmost public university at the time of its 1957 founding, is located in Tampa. Florida State Road 70 bisects approximately in the Central Florida region from west to east. However, Tampa is not considered South Florida region.

Enterprise Florida, the state&#x27;s economic development agency, identifies &quot;Southeast Florida&quot; as one of eight economic regions used by the agency and other state and outside entities, including the Florida Department of Transportation. Some entities alternately designate this region &quot;South Florida&quot;. Its definition includes much of the same territory as Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s report, except the Gulf Coast and much of the interior Glades region.. It includes Monroe County and the three metropolitan counties of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, as well as the three &quot;Treasure Coast&quot; counties of Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin to the north.

==Demographics==
The demographics of South Florida residents can be segmented as following:

Over 87.2% of all foreigners residing in South Florida come from Latin America.

=== Political affiliations ===
South Florida is politically diverse, with multiple congressional districts in the region supporting both the Democratic and Republican parties. As evidenced by the 2020 United States presidential election, supporters of the Democratic Party are mostly concentrated in urban areas, as well as areas to the west of and including downtown Key West, rural communities surrounding Immokalee, and the areas surrounding Belle Glade, while supporters of the Republican Party reside in the most costal regions of the Miami area north of Pompano Beach, most of the Everglades, most of the regions between Port St. Lucie and Riviera Beach, Southwest Florida, and a supermajority of the region&#x27;s inland and rural areas.

==Cities==

Largest cities in South Florida by population:
==Culture==
===Miami accent===
The Miami accent is a regional accent of the American English dialect spoken in South Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties. The accent was born in central Miami, but has expanded to the rest of South Florida in the decades since the 1960s. The Miami accent is most prevalent in American-born South Floridian youth.

The Miami accent is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially the New York area dialect, Northern New Jersey English, and New York Latino English.) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects, the &quot;Miami accent&quot; is rhotic; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is syllable-timed).

===Politics===

Lamme and Oldakowski identify several demographic, political, and cultural elements that characterize South Florida and distinguish it from other areas of the state. Many of its differences appear to be driven by its proportionately higher level of migration from the northern U.S. states and from the Caribbean and Latin America, particularly in the densely populated Miami area. Politically, South Florida is more liberal than the rest of the state. While less than 10% of people in either North or Central Florida felt their area was liberal, over a third of South Floridians described their region as such. 38% characterized the area as conservative; 26% as moderate. This tracks with South Florida&#x27;s demographics, and Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s findings parallel Barney Warf and Cynthia Waddell&#x27;s research on Florida&#x27;s political geography during the 2000 Presidential election. The economy in South Florida is very similar to that in Central Florida. Compared to the more diversified economy in North Florida, tourism is by far the most significant industry in South and Central Florida, with a much smaller but vibrant agricultural industry.

===Cuisine===
Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s survey also found some cultural indicators distinguishing South Florida. South Florida is the only region of the state where ethnic foods are as popular as general American cuisine. Floribbean cuisine is a fusion cuisine which developed in South Florida, drawing influence from Floridian, Caribbean, Asian and Latin American cuisines. Additionally, while there was little geographical variation for most styles of music, there was regional variation for both country and Latin music. Country was significantly less popular in South Florida than in North or Central Florida, while Latin was more popular than in the other regions.

===Urban planning===
The Anthony J. Catanese Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions at Florida Atlantic University notes the unusual growth pattern of South Florida. Unlike many areas with centralized cities surrounded by development, most of South Florida is preserved natural area and designated agricultural reserves, with development restricted to a dense, narrow strip along the coast. The developed area is highly urbanized and increasingly continuous and decentralized, with no particular dominant core cities. The center projects this pattern to continue in the future.

==Partition proposals==

There have been several proposals for partitioning the state of Florida to form a separate state of South Florida. Such proposals have usually been made as political statement rather than serious attempts at secession. Reasons often stated are cultural, ethnic, economic, and financial frustrations with the state government in Tallahassee, which is in North Florida.

In 2008, the North Lauderdale City Commission passed a resolution calling for a new state of South Florida to be formed from Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties.

In 2014, South Miami&#x27;s city commission passed a resolution in favor of splitting the state in half, with a northern boundary drawn to include the counties of Brevard, Orange, Polk, Hillsborough, and Pinellas, which roughly includes parts of Tampa Bay and Orlando areas. In total, the proposed State of South Florida would have included 24 counties.
