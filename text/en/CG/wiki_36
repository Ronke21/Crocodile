<text>The King&#x27;s Guard are sentry postings at Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace, organised by the British Army&#x27;s Household Division. The Household Division also mounts sentry postings at Horse Guards, known as the King&#x27;s Life Guard.

An infantry contingent, typically one of the Household Division&#x27;s five regiments of foot guards, mounts the King&#x27;s Guard, while the King&#x27;s Life Guard is usually provided for by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. Since the 20th century, several other British Army units, Royal Air Force units, Royal Navy units, and military units from other Commonwealth countries have been invited to form the King&#x27;s Guard.

In addition to the King&#x27;s Guard, the Household Division also provide for several other sentry postings including the &quot;Tower of London Guard&quot; and the &quot;Windsor Castle Guard&quot;. Several sentry postings are also occasionally mounted at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the sovereign&#x27;s residence in Edinburgh. Although the Household Division considers these other sentry posts as distinct postings from the King&#x27;s Guard, colloquially, these postings have also been called the &quot;King&#x27;s Guard”.

==Operating area==
The King&#x27;s Guard and King&#x27;s Life Guard are sentry postings that come under the operating area of the British Army&#x27;s London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division.

The Household Division typically has one infantry battalion posted for public duties; rotating between the first battalion of all five Foot Guards Regiments except the Scots Guards. In addition, there are five incremental companies based at Victoria Barracks, Windsor and Wellington Barracks - one each of the Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards plus two from whichever Guards battalion is posted to 11th Security Force Assistance Brigade. All of these units come under the administrative authority of the London District – as public duties units, they not only take part in ceremonial but are also committed to providing military aid to the civilian authorities.

===King&#x27;s Guard===
The King&#x27;s Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James&#x27;s Palace. Because the Sovereign&#x27;s official residence is still St James&#x27;s, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment&#x27;s colours. When the Sovereign is in residence, the King&#x27;s Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James&#x27;s Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House). This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The King&#x27;s Guard is not purely ceremonial. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace. Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman – due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence.

====Detachments====

The King&#x27;s Guard in London changes in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace at 11:00 am every day in early summer and four times per week otherwise.

The St James&#x27;s Palace detachment of the King&#x27;s Guard, led usually by the corps of drums, and bearing the colour (if the King is in residence, then this will be the King&#x27;s colour; if he is not, then it is the regimental colour), marches along the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where the Buckingham Palace detachment has formed up to await their arrival. These two detachments are the old guard. Meanwhile, the new guard is forming and is awaiting inspection by the adjutant on the parade square at Wellington Barracks. The band, having been inspected by the adjutant, forms a circle to play music whilst the new guard is inspected. The guard provides a full military band consisting of no fewer than 35 musicians (usually from one of the Guard regiments) led by their director of music. When the new guard is formed up and led by the band, it marches across into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Once there, the new Guard advances toward the old guard in slow time and halts. The old guard presents arms, followed by the new guard presenting arms. The captains of the guards march towards each other for the handing over of the palace keys. The new reliefs are marched to the guardrooms of Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace where new sentries are posted.

During this time the band has taken its place by the centre gate, formed up in a half-circle, where it plays music to entertain the new and old guard as well as the watching crowds. During this period, the two regimental colours are paraded up and down by the ensigns (usually junior officers of second lieutenant rank or equivalent). With the old and new guards formed once again, the old guard and the band march out through the centre gates in slow time to their regimental slow march played by the band. At the end of the slow march, the captain of the old guard gives the word of command to &#x27;break into quick time&#x27; and with a brisk five-pace roll from the drums, the band leads the way back to Wellington Barracks.

===King&#x27;s Life Guard===

The King&#x27;s Life Guard is the mounted guard at the entrance to Horse Guards. Horse Guards is the official main entrance to both St James&#x27;s Palace and Buckingham Palace (a tradition that stems from the time when the Mall was closed at both ends); however, sentries have been posted there since the Stuart Restoration, when the Palace of Whitehall was the main royal residence.

The guard is on horseback from 10 am until 4 pm, with the two sentries changing every hour. From 4 pm until 8 pm a pair of dismounted sentries remain. At 8 pm, the gates of Horse Guards are locked, and a single sentry remains until 7 am. When the King is in London, the Guard consists of one officer, one corporal major (who carries the standard), two non-commissioned officers, one trumpeter and eleven troopers. This is known as a &quot;long guard&quot;. When the King is not resident in London, the Guard is reduced to two non-commissioned officers and ten troopers. This is known as a &quot;short guard&quot;.

At the time of guard changing, the old guard forms up on the north side of the enclosure on Horse Guards Parade and the new guard on the south side. As the new guard arrives, each guard carries the standard and the trumpeters of both old and new guards sound the royal salute on the arrival of the new guard and the departure of the old guard. When both guards have formed up in the enclosure, the corporal major, senior NCO and sentries of the first relief of the new guard leave for the guard room, which is then handed over. The sentries of the old guard, after being relieved, rejoin the remainder of the old guard on the north side of the enclosure. The standard and trumpeters are only on parade with a long guard.

==Procedure while at post==

A sentry will be on duty &quot;at their post&quot; for two hours. Every 10 minutes, he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry does this four to five times before halting. He then shoulders arms and stands at ease. &#x27;Standing easy&#x27; is not permitted whilst a sentry is at their post. Orders for sentry duty read out before each two-hour &#x27;tour of duty&#x27;, make it clear that sentries &quot;may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during [their] tour of duty&quot;.

Sentries receive instruction on how to eliminate nuisance or any suggestion of threat from members of the public. There is a protocol they follow which begins with &quot;stamping&quot; (coming to attention sharply). He will also shout: &quot;Stand back from the King&#x27;s Guard&quot; or similar. If this does not eliminate the nuisance or threat he will repeat the stamp and shout again. If the nuisance or threat still does not cease the sentry will assume the position of &quot;port arms&quot; whereby he points his rifle at the source of the interference. If these warnings are not heeded the sentry then has the choice of detaining the person(s) himself or pressing the button in his sentry box to summon assistance.

If a person steps in front of a sentry while he/she is marching, the latter will shout: &quot;Make way for the King&#x27;s Guard!&quot;.

===Discipline===
Although the guards were previously positioned among the public, in recent times, more and more of the sentry posts have been moved away from the public because of incidents involving tourists interfering with the guards&#x27; job, as well as incidents where the guards have had to discipline tourists for disrespectful or dangerous behaviour. In 2012, footage of a tourist disrespecting the guards went viral, in which a Russian tourist refused to stop their attempt at climbing the Buckingham Palace fence despite the guard aiming his SA80 rifle at the would-be intruder. Most recently, ropes were installed between the sentry posts at Windsor Castle and the public after an incident occurred between a sentry and a tourist who was mocking him, pretending to march alongside him and eventually grabbing the shoulder on which his rifle was resting.

In London, the sentry posts most recently remaining not behind any sort of fence were those at the Pall Mall entrance to St James&#x27;s Palace. In December 2014, the Pall Mall sentries were moved to Friary Court inside the walls of the palace, while the Clarence House sentries repositioned inside the fence and at the entrance to the gardens. This was a result of the increased threat of lone wolf terrorist attacks, particularly following the murder of a British soldier in Woolwich, and the terrorist attack on the Canadian Parliament.

===Arms plot===
Battalions on public duties were part of the regular arms plot, a system where infantry battalions were periodically rotated to various locations and different roles. Following the restructuring of the army announced in 2006, the arms plot system ceased – infantry battalions have now been given fixed roles and locations. In theory, this includes public duties in London, which will retain its two guards and one-line infantry battalion. However, for some postings, including public duties, light role infantry battalions will continue to rotate. In the case of public duties in London, the four Guards battalions will rotate every two years, with two being posted as part of the Field Army in 4th Infantry Brigade, one as a smaller Security Force Assistance Battalion with 11th SFA Brigade, and one Light Role public duties battalion. The shift from two to one public duties battalion has been offset by the addition of two more incremental companies, and the addition of four Guards reserve companies - who take supporting roles such as street lining in important occasions as well as on combat operations.

==Personnel==
===King&#x27;s Guards===
Postings for the King&#x27;s Guard are usually formed from one of the five regiments of foot guards:

*Grenadier Guards
*Coldstream Guards
*Scots Guards
*Irish Guards
*Welsh Guards
In addition, the RAF Regiment takes over the guard for around three weeks per year. The King&#x27;s Colour Squadron is the RAF Regiment&#x27;s dedicated ceremonial unit for this task. The King&#x27;s Colour Squadron represents the whole Royal Air Force as the units mounting the guard need to be infantry trained.

On occasion, other units from the British Army and Royal Navy have provided the guard. Additionally, other units from the armed forces of several Commonwealth countries have formed the guard.

====Other British Army units====
Several other British Army units have also formed the guard. Prior to Options for Change, because there were a total of eight guards battalions, it was rare for battalions of line infantry to mount the King&#x27;s Guard and, as such, was a significant honour. Before 1996, only two battalions had served on public duties as part of an operational tour in London District. However, when the 2nd Battalions of the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards were put in suspended animation, a decision to replace one of the three Foot Guard battalions then engaged on public duties by a line infantry battalion was taken, so as to enable the Foot Guards battalion to increase the proportion of its effort employed on training for operational roles. From 1996 to 2013, a line infantry battalion was stationed in London (first at Hounslow, then Woolwich) under the command of London District:

Since 2013, regular public duties responsibility has reverted to the Household Division. However, line infantry units occasionally provide the Guard for short periods of time. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment is a line infantry regiment and home defence unit of British Forces Gibraltar, that formed the Queen&#x27;s Guard in March 2001, April 2012 and March 2022. In 2012, the Royal Gibraltar Regiment became the first unit to provide both the Queen&#x27;s Guard and the Saluting Battery simultaneously. In the summer of 2018, Balaklava Company, the dedicated public duties unit of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, both provided the Guard at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

Units from the Army Reserve, and its predecessor, the Territorial Army, have also formed the guard. In 1938, the Honourable Artillery Company, a Territorial Army unit, provided the King&#x27;s Guard. The same regiment subsequently provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard in 1958. In June 2015, soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Welsh, provided the Tower of London detachment of the Queen&#x27;s Guard.

The following is a list of units of the line infantry regiments that have formed the King&#x27;s Guard:

The following is a list of Gurkha units that have formed the guard:
====Other British armed units====

On 14 May 1941, the Home Guard provided the King&#x27;s Guard, in recognition of the first anniversary of its foundation. This was repeated in May 1943.

Royal Marines units have formed the guard on three occasions. 41 Commando formed the guard in November 1978, while 42 Commando formed the guard in July 1986 and June 2014.

In November 2017, the Royal Navy mounted the guard with a company-sized detachment formed of volunteers from 45 ships and shore establishments for two weeks. This was the first time that the Royal Navy had formed the Guard in its own right, rather than being represented by the Royal Marines.

Airborne sappers from 9 Parachute Squadron RE (now of 23 Parachute Engineer Regiment) conducted the guard in 1987, 2009 and 2023.

====Commonwealth units====
Units from the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations have occasionally formed the King&#x27;s Guard. The 117th (Eastern Townships) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force was the first non-British unit to form the guard in 1916. The first time commands were given in another language other than English occurred in 1940, when the French Canadian Royal 22e Régiment formed the guard and issued their commands in French. Only one unit from a Commonwealth country where the sovereign was not head of state has formed the guard, the 1st Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment in 2008.

British Empire and Commonwealth units have formed the guard to mark a number of occasions, such as the coronations of George VI in 1937 and Elizabeth II in 1953. Commonwealth units have also formed the guard to mark anniversaries or to reinforce close ties with the United Kingdom. The Royal Canadian Air Force mounted the guard in 2018 to commemorate the Royal Air Force&#x27;s 100th anniversary and the cooperative history between the two air forces.

Units that have formed the guard to commemorate national historic anniversaries include the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who formed the guard in 1988 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the First Fleet&#x27;s arrival to Australia, and the Federation Guard in 2000 to commemorate the centenary of the Federation of Australia. The Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry also formed the guard in 2017 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation. Units have also formed the guard to commemorate their own anniversaries, with the Royal 22e Régiment forming the guard in 2014 to commemorate their 100th anniversary, and The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery forming the guard in 2021 to commemorate their 150th anniversary.

Some Commonwealth units will form the guard on days that are significant to their country, with the Jamaica Regiment having mounted the guard on Jamaican Emancipation Day and Independence Day, and the Royal Canadian Air Force having formed the guard on Canada Day.

The following is a list of units from the British Empire and Commonwealth to have mounted the King&#x27;s Guard:


====Non-Commonwealth units====
On 8 April 2024, to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale, a detachment from the 2e Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie of the French Garde Republicaine became the first unit from a non-Commonwealth country to participate in the ceremony - the detachment were marched onto the forecourt of Buckingham Palace in place of that day&#x27;s New Guard, and were inspected by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh alongside Hélène Tréheux-Duchêne, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, before then being marched off. In a reciprocal arrangement, soldiers of No. 7 Company, Coldstream Guards took part in the guard mounting ceremony at the Élysée Palace, official residence of the French President, in Paris.

===King&#x27;s Life Guard===

The guard is usually provided by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (HCMR), with the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals alternating. When the HCMR leaves London for a month of summer training (and rest for the horses), the guard is provided by the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery.

Only two other units have mounted the Life Guard. In 2000, the Mounted Troop of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), a regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, mounted the Life Guard during the same deployment as The Royal Canadian Regiment provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard. In 2012, as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Musical Ride of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police mounted the Life Guard for a day in May 2012, becoming the first non-military unit to take up the posting.

===Musical accompanients===
Musical accompaniments for the King&#x27;s Guard are typically provided by one of the seven military bands of the Household Division. This includes the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry, the Countess of Wessex&#x27;s String Orchestra and the five bands for the foot guards. The Foot Guards bands are:

*Band of the Grenadier Guards
*Band of the Coldstream Guards
*Band of the Scots Guards
* Band of the Irish Guards
* Band of the Welsh Guards 

In addition to the bands of the Household Division, several other bands have been invited to provide musical support for the Queen&#x27;s Guards. The band of the Honourable Artillery Company has occasionally been invited to provide musical support since the 1990s and continues to do so in the 21st century.

Several military bands from the Commonwealth have also provided musical support during guard mounting ceremonies, typically when their respective national military units are mounting the guard. In May and June 2014, the Vancouver Police Pipe Band was invited to provide musical support during the mounting of the Queen&#x27;s Guard, to commemorate its 100th anniversary. The pipe band was the first non-military pipe band to perform during a guard mounting ceremony.

===Women and the guard===
The first woman to mount the King&#x27;s Guard was Captain Cynthia Anderson of Australia&#x27;s Federation Guard in 2000. She was also the first female to command a Queen&#x27;s Guard detachment, having led an Australian Federation Guard unit during morning parade. The first female infantry officer to command the Queen&#x27;s Guard through the changing of the guard was Captain Megan Couto of the Canadian Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry in June 2017.

In April 2007, the first women from a British Army unit served on detachments of the Queen&#x27;s Guard, when the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery took over the guard at Windsor Castle, and the Army Air Corps took on public duties in London. Female officers were also among the contingent of Royal Canadian Mounted Police members who formed the Queen&#x27;s Life Guard in May 2012.

==Incidents==

The King&#x27;s Guard is an operational posting, with the primary purpose of protecting the Sovereign. There have been a handful of incidents when this protection has been tested. In 1982, a man named Michael Fagan was able to evade the sentries before he was captured by police. In this instance, security of the Queen&#x27;s room was the task of the Metropolitan Police.

In 2004, a member of the pressure group Fathers4Justice spent five and a half hours standing on the parapet by the balcony at the front of Buckingham Palace. Again, the security was the primary responsibility of the Metropolitan Police. Although the Queen was not present at the time, it raised fears of the possibility of a terrorist attack on the palace, and gave rise to calls for the British Army to be given a greater hand in the overall security of the Royal Family.

==Related sentry postings==
In addition to the King&#x27;s Guard, the Household Division is also responsible for mounting the Tower of London Guard and the Windsor Castle Guard. Scottish regiments posted at Redford Barracks may also post sentries at Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyrood, the sovereign&#x27;s residence in Edinburgh. Although the Household Division considers these other sentry posts as distinct postings from the King&#x27;s Guard, colloquially, these other postings have also been called the &quot;King&#x27;s Guard&quot;

===London===
In addition to the King&#x27;s Guard, the Household Division also manned several other guard positions in London. In 1819, the Household Division maintained ten separate guard mountings for 89 sentry posts. This included the Armoury Guard, the British Museum Guard, the Kensington Palace Guard, the Magazine Guard, the Military Asylum Guard, the Savoy Prison Guard, the Tylt Guards at the south of Horse Guards, and the York Hospital Guard. The Household Division had also provided night guards for the Bank of England, Covent Garden Opera House, and Drury Lane. However, the Household Division&#x27;s commitment to most of these postings, except for the King&#x27;s Guard, ceased by the end of the 19th century. Some postings were abandoned due to a building&#x27;s demolition. Responsibility for the British Museum Guard was transferred to the Metropolitan Police in 1866.

====Tower of London Guard====

In addition to the King&#x27;s Guard, the Household Division also mans the Tower of London Guard, who is also responsible for providing the guard at the Tower of London. As the Tower is still officially a royal residence and is also the location of the crown jewels, it remains the Army&#x27;s obligation to guard it. The Tower guard numbers one officer, three NCOs and ten soldiers, and usually posts a sentry outside the Jewel House and one outside the King&#x27;s House. As the protection of the Tower is their responsibility (in conjunction with the Yeoman Warders), the guard must also see it is secure at night (see Ceremony of the Keys).

====The Bank Picquet====

During the Gordon Riots in 1780, a detachment of the Foot Guards successfully defended the Bank of England from a violent mob. Thenceforth the bank paid for a detachment of soldiers, usually provided by the Brigade of Guards, to defend the Bank. From 1780, the detachment marched from their barracks, initially from the Tower of London, later Wellington or Chelsea Barracks, though in bad weather the detachment would be sent by a normal train of the London Underground.

With a guard mount at 3pm, each guard consisted of one officer, one sergeant, one corporal, one lance corporal, eight guardsmen and a drummer; originally the guard had thirty guardsmen.

Once at the bank, there were two sentry posts, one outside the Counting House Parlour and another outside the bullion vaults. The officer was given half a bottle of port and the right to invite a friend or two to dinner in the bank. The other ranks were given a pint of beer with their dinner and one brand new shilling, two for a sergeant, to buy tea and a cake in the canteen. The Guard wore plimsolls in the Bank.

From 1963, the Bank Picquet travelled by vehicle clad in service dress and armed with automatic weapons, with the emphasis on security moving from ceremonial to tactical deployment. Improved security features and armed police made the guard unnecessary, and the service ended on the evening of 31 July 1973.

===Windsor===
One of the public duties battalions or incremental companies is responsible for providing the Windsor Castle Guard. The location of the ceremony at Windsor varies; in the Easter, when the King is in residence it usually takes place on the lawn in the castle&#x27;s quadrangle. In wet weather or winter, to protect the lawn, or when the King is not holding court at Windsor Castle, the ceremony occurs outside the guardroom by Henry VIII&#x27;s Gateway at the foot of Castle Hill.

The ceremony for changing the Windsor Guard is broadly the same as that which takes place at Buckingham Palace. At 10:40 am, the new guard marches from Victoria Barracks, through Windsor and turns left, going up Castle Hill to enter the Lower Ward. During Easter, and when the King is holding court at the castle, the guards change in the Upper Ward on the grass.

When changing guard in the normal way, the new guard arrives at roughly 11 am when the old guard has formed up outside the guardroom. Once both guards and the duty band (there is no duty band on Sundays) are present, the old guard and new guard will present arms to each other, interspersed by bugle calls – the officers will then go towards each other and symbolically touch left hands to &#x27;hand over the keys to the castle (though no actual keys are handed over anymore). The guards will then slope arms and the reliefs will be formed up to go around the castle and change the sentries – during this process, the band typically plays a selection of music. Once the relief returns, the old guard forms back up ready to march back to Victoria Barracks. The band leads them out whilst the new guard presents arms. Once the old guard has left, the new guard is dismissed to the guardroom where they will be based for the next 24/48 hours – every two hours, the guard relief will march out and change the sentries.

===Edinburgh===
Sentry posts are mounted at Palace of Holyroodhouse and at Edinburgh Castle. Although the Household Division&#x27;s primarily operates in London and Windsor, the Scots Guards have mounted these postings when the sovereign is in Edinburgh.

These sentry postings are also mounted at other times of the year, including Lord Commissioner&#x27;s Week, and the month of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. These sentries may also sometimes serve as the guard of honour for the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. As there is no guard battalion permanently based in the city, sentries are provided by whichever resident infantry battalion is at Redford Barracks.

Until 2001, sentries were permanently posted on the Esplanade at the entrance of the castle, ostensibly as the guards to the Honours of Scotland housed inside. The sentries were changed every hour. However, cutbacks in the size of the army led to the permanent castle guard being abolished. As part of the reorganisation of the infantry following the 2003 defence review, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Royal Regiment of Scotland (the Royal Scots Borderers and Royal Highland Fusiliers) were permanently based in Edinburgh, rotating between 19 Light Brigade or 52 Infantry Brigade. Whichever battalion is assigned to the 52 Brigade was responsible for performing public duties in Edinburgh. As part of the 2010 defence review, further reforms to the infantry led to the reduction of the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland to an incremental company (similar to the three companies of foot guards stationed in London) which is now a public duties unit permanently based in Scotland.

<text>Tyrker (or Tyrkir) is a character mentioned in the Norse Saga of the Greenlanders. He accompanied Leif on his voyage of discovery around the year 1000, and is portrayed as an older male servant. He is referred to as “foster father” by Leif Ericson, which may indicate he was a freed thrall, who once had the responsibility of looking after and rearing the young Leif.

Leif and his company wintered in the New World after building Leifsbudir (&quot;Leif’s dwellings&quot;), perhaps somewhere in Newfoundland or the adjacent area. According to the saga, he divided his men into two parties, which took turns in exploring the surrounding area. He cautioned his followers to keep together and return to sleep at their quarters.
One evening Tyrker did not return with his party. Greatly distraught, Leif, at the head of twelve men, went in search of him, and he had not gone far when he discovered the old thrall, greatly excited, gesticulating wildly, and evidently drunk.
“Why, my fosterer,” cried Leif, “have you come so late? What made you leave your companions!” Tyrker answered in his own language, but when remembering that the Norsemen could not understand him, he spoke, after some time, in their tongue:
“I have not gone very far; still I have some news for you. I have discovered vines loaded with grapes.”
“Are you telling the truth, my foster-father?” exclaimed Leif.
“I am sure of telling the truth,” Tyrker said, “for in my native land there are vines in plenty.”
This caused Leif to give the country the name of Vinland.

Tyrker&#x27;s origin is debated among historians, with evidence presented for German, Hungarian, Slavic or even Turkish backgrounds. The saga refers to him speaking a language that has variously been interpreted as referring to &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Turkish&quot;, the latter in which case would account for the last three possibilities of ethnicity, upon finding the wine berries on Vinland. Additionally, the story shares the element of wild grapes with the Irish &quot;The Voyage of Máel Dúin&quot;. However, the Norse word used in the saga is . While this sometimes refers to grapes, it also translates into &quot;wine-berry&quot;, and there is a long-standing Nordic tradition to make wine out of berries available. We know from historical records that the Icelanders and Greenlanders even made wine from crowberry.
In the Newfoundland/Labrador area, squashberry, gooseberry, and cranberry all grow wild, and may serve as an explanations for Leif&#x27;s discovery of &quot;wine-berries&quot;.

Remains of a Norse settlement from the period in question has been found at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada.

<text>Regent College is an interdenominational evangelical Christian College of Christian studies, and an affiliated college of the University of British Columbia, located next to the university&#x27;s campus in the University Endowment Lands west of Vancouver, British Columbia. The school&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;cultivate intelligent, vigorous, and joyful commitment to Jesus Christ, His church, and His world.&quot;

About 500 students are enrolled in full or part-time studies. In any given year, one-third to one-half of students are Canadian, another one-quarter to one-third are American, and the remaining twenty to thirty per cent come from around the globe.

== History ==

Regent was established in 1968 to provide graduate theological education to the laity, and only in 1979 started a program to train students who will become clergy. After the first summer school class, the graduate Diploma of Christian Studies began; within two years, enrollment grew from 4 to 44 students and the Master of Christian Studies was added. Affiliation with UBC followed in 1975, and accreditation by the Association of Theological Schools in 1985. The last comprehensive evaluation occurred in 2010.

The principals and presidents of the college have been James M. Houston (1970–1978), Carl Armerding (1978–1988), Walter Wright Jr. (1988–2000) and outgoing president Rod Wilson (2000–2015). Jeffrey P. Greenman began his term as the fifth president on February 1, 2015. Greenman is the first alumnus of Regent College to become president.

Regent initially rented rooms in various buildings at UBC, including St. Andrews Hall and Vancouver School of Theology, and occupied two fraternity houses on Wesbrook Mall for a time. In 1989, Regent moved into its own new building in the current location at the corner of Wesbrook &amp; University, with the distinctive green roof. A subsequent capital campaign finished in 2006, adding the John Richard Allison Library and the Windtower to Regent College&#x27;s architectural distinctiveness.

== Academic programs ==

Though Regent College is an affiliated school of the UBC, unlike other affiliated schools such as Vancouver School of Economy, the University does not offer any theological degree due to the &quot;University&quot; Act. The college does offer four main graduate programs, all ATS-accredited:
* Graduate Diploma in Christian Studies (DipCS)
* Master of Arts in Christian Studies (MACS)
* Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS)
* Master of Divinity (M.Div.)
* Master of Theology (Th.M.)
* Master of Arts in Leadership, Theology, and Society (MALTS)

== Student life ==

On Tuesdays during fall and winter term, the college community gathers for chapel, followed by optional community group meetings and a lunch of homemade soup and bread. The Regent College Student Association oversees a variety of student life activities and services, including Taste of the World, book sales, an annual Christmas Party, an annual retreat, the Regent Spouse&#x27;s Network, and more.

Because Regent is a UBC affiliate school, Regent students qualify for the U-Pass and the AMS insurance plan, and may make use of other UBC services such as the library system, health centre, and the pool.

== Alumni and faculty ==
More than 4,500 students have graduated from Regent College and, due to the summer programs, over 30,000 students have taken classes. After Vancouver, Hong Kong hosts the second greatest number of Regent graduates, with other major pockets in Seattle, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Singapore and London.

At present, Regent College employs 17 full-time faculty. Notable faculty emeriti include Eugene Peterson, Maxine Hancock, Loren Wilkinson, Gordon T. Smith, Paul Stevens, Gordon Fee, J.I. Packer and Bruce Waltke. Summer school classes are often taught by some notable Christian thinkers, including N.T. Wright, Andrew Walls, Luci Shaw, Richard Mouw, Alister McGrath, Malcolm Guite, George Marsden and Mark Noll.

== Buildings and features ==
The &quot;John Richard Allison Library&quot; is one of the major theological libraries in Western Canada. It houses the resources of Regent and Carey Theological College. Its catalogue is shared with Carey Theological College, Vancouver School of Theology, and St. Mark&#x27;s College.

&quot;Regent College Bookstore&quot; is one of the premier theological bookstores in Western Canada. It frequently hosts public lectures and booksignings, and has its own publishing program.

&quot;The Dal Schindell Gallery&quot; showcases seven annual exhibitions, including shows by Regent students in the Christianity and the Arts concentration.

&quot;The Chapel&quot; is the heart of worship and community building at Regent. The weekly Tuesday Chapel service at 11 am is widely attended by students, faculty, staff, and guests. The piano within is a Steinway grand.

&quot;True North Windtower&quot; features photovoltaic art glass by artist Sarah Hall, and it has been documented by the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada.

&quot;The Atrium &amp; The Well,&quot; a coffee shop which grew out of one Regent student’s final Christianity &amp; the Marketplace project. In 2011 the kitchen off the Atrium was re-dedicated as the Rita Houston Kitchen, to mark the powerful impact of Rita Houston on Regent’s community life over the years.

== Media ==

Regent College produces a wide variety of print and electronic media, including:

* &quot;Crux: A Quarterly Journal of Christian Thought and Opinion&quot;
* &quot;Regent World&quot;, a thrice-yearly newsletter
* &quot;EtCetera&quot;, a student newspaper published bi-weekly during the regular term. 
* &quot;EtCetera Podcast&quot;, a student podcast published bi-weekly in partnership with the &quot;EtCetera&quot; student newspaper. &quot;The EtCetera Podcast&quot; is hosted by the EtCetera Senior Editor.
* ReFrame, a 10-week film based small group curriculum 
* Regent Audio
* Regent Bookstore

In addition, Regent College Publishing specializes in re-publishing out-of-print Christian literature and features an increasing number of original titles. Notable recent projects include a parallel-prose edition of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and co-published works by Gordon Fee and Bruce Waltke.

<text>Herbert Percy Horne (1864 in London – 1916 in Florence, Italy) was an English poet, architect, typographer and designer, art historian and antiquarian. He was an associate of the Rhymers&#x27; Club in London. He edited the magazines &quot;The Century Guild Hobby Horse&quot; and &quot;The Hobby Horse&quot; for the Century Guild of Artists, which he founded with fellow architect Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo in 1882.

Horne was closely associated with Arthur Symons and Selwyn Image and their mistress Muriel (Edith) Broadbent. Later in life he settled in Florence, restoring a Renaissance palazzo into which he eventually moved. He first visited Italy in 1889 and kept an illustrated journal of his travels and art and architectural research. His monograph on Sandro Botticelli from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness.

==Death and commemoration==
He donated his collection, of arts and handicrafts of the 14th and 15th centuries, to create the &quot;Museo della Fondazione Horne&quot; in Florence, where he died.

He is buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Galluzzo (Italy).

Horne founded the Riccardi Press, a leading British private press that beginning in 1909 issued titles for the Medici Society and later under its own imprint.

<doc id="985175" wikidata="Q4731511" url="?curid=985175" title="Allen Arena">
<text>Allen Arena is an indoor arena at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. The arena was named in honor of James C. and Linda Allen, the facility&#x27;s primary benefactors. James Allen is a member of the board of trustees for the university and worked for the university at one time. The arena is primarily used for basketball and volleyball athletic events and is also used for daily chapel services and occasional concerts.

==Facilities==
Other than hosting athletic events and on campus convocations, the arena hosts many events such as dinners, concerts, area-wide worship services, and graduations (the university and Nashville surrounding high schools). The facility has been host to events such as the annual Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation Concert, bringing entertainers such as former Vibe host Sinbad, Dana Carvey, and Jay Leno.

Besides being the home of Lipscomb sports teams, it served as the home of the now-defunct Nashville franchise, the Nashville Rhythm, in the revived American Basketball Association. It was also the home of the Music City Stars, an American Basketball Association team during the 2009–10 season.

==History==
The Allen Arena opened on October 28, 2001, with a local worship service called &quot;In His Hands&quot;. The Arena and adjacent parking garage was the site for the school&#x27;s old McQuiddy Gym name after J.C. McQuiddy Part of the McQuiddy Gym was retained along with the adjacent Student Activities Center (SAC). Yearwood Hall, a women&#x27;s dormitory, was torn down for construction of the arena.

In the first Lipscomb Bisons home game at Allen Arena, Bison Clayton Osborne made an inbounds shot from three-quarters of the court away. With no time remaining, the ball fell through the net, giving the Bisons a 78–77 victory over the North Texas Mean Green.

The arena hosted the 2008 and 2009 Atlantic Sun Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments.

Due to the damage incurred to the Grand Ole Opry House during the May 2010 Tennessee floods and because the Ryman Auditorium was unavailable, Allen Arena hosted the June 5 and June 15, 2010 editions of the Grand Ole Opry. In October 2013, the arena held the nationally televised 44th GMA Dove Awards for the Christian music scene.

==Capacity==
Arena seating capacity is between 4,000 and 5,000 depending upon the purpose for which it is being used, and is officially given as 5,028, which is the capacity in the format typically utilized.

<doc id="985178" wikidata="Q1550315" url="?curid=985178" title="The Salt Lake Tribune">
<text>The Salt Lake Tribune is a newspaper published in the city of Salt Lake City, Utah. The &quot;Tribune&quot; is owned by The Salt Lake Tribune, Inc., a non-profit corporation. The newspaper&#x27;s motto is &quot;Utah&#x27;s Independent Voice Since 1871.&quot;

==History==
===19th century===
A successor to &quot;Utah Magazine&quot; (1868), &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; was founded as the &quot;Mormon Tribune&quot; by a group of businessmen led by former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) William Godbe, Elias L.T. Harrison and Edward Tullidge, who disagreed with the church&#x27;s economic and political positions. After a year, the publishers changed the name to the &quot;Salt Lake Daily Tribune and Utah Mining Gazette&quot;, but soon after that, they shortened it to &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;.

Three Kansas businessmen, Frederic Lockley, George F. Prescott and A.M. Hamilton, purchased the company in 1873 and turned it into an anti-Mormon newspaper which consistently backed the local Liberal Party. Sometimes vitriolic, the &quot;Tribune&quot; held particular antipathy for LDS Church president Brigham Young. In the edition announcing Young&#x27;s death, the &quot;Tribune&quot; wrote:

===20th century===
In 1901, newly elected United States senator Thomas Kearns, a Roman Catholic, and his business partner, David Keith, secretly bought the &quot;Tribune&quot;. After Keith died in 1918, the Kearns family bought out Keith&#x27;s share of the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Company. Eventually, the parent company became Kearns-Tribune Corporation.

The company began an evening edition in 1902, known as &quot;The Salt Lake Telegram&quot;. &quot;The Telegram&quot; was sold in 1914 and reacquired by the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1930. It was phased out when the joint operating agreement was formed with the afternoon &quot;Deseret News&quot;, Salt Lake&#x27;s daily newspaper owned by the LDS Church, in 1952.
John F. Fitzpatrick became publisher in 1924, ushering in what became seven decades of peaceful coexistence with the dominant LDS Church. In 1952 the&quot;Tribune&quot; entered into a joint operating agreement with the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and created the Newspaper Agency Corporation. Fitzpatrick was the architect of NAC at the request of LDS Church President David O. McKay whose newspaper was near bankruptcy at the time. Fitzpatrick died of a heart attack in 1960, and was succeeded by John W. Gallivan, who had been trained as the next publisher from the time he joined the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1937. Gallivan often joked with aspiring journalism students, telling them the best way to the publisher&#x27;s desk was to get yourself left on the doorstep of the owner. (He had been orphaned at the age of five, then taken in by his mother&#x27;s half-sister, Mrs. Thomas Kearns.) In the late 1950s, in spite of reluctance from John Fitzpatrick about the future of television, Gallivan joined a measured &quot;Tribune&quot; investment with The Standard Corporation in Ogden, Utah, to build one of the first microwave and cable TV systems across northern Nevada. On weekends, Gallivan traveled by bus to Elko, Nevada, to oversee the construction beginnings. Gallivan and Denver cable investor Bob Magness merged their companies into Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) which eventually became the largest cable television company in the world. &quot;The Tribune&quot;″s ownership interest in TCI reached nearly 15%, which played a large role in later mergers between the two companies. Gallivan remained as &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher until 1984, and chairman of the board until 1997.

For almost 100 years, it was a family-owned newspaper held by the heirs of U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns. After Kearns died in 1918, the company was controlled by his widow, Jennie Judge Kearns, and then the newspaper&#x27;s longtime publisher was John F. Fitzpatrick, who started his career as secretary to Senator Kearns in 1913 and remained publisher until his death in 1960. John W. Gallivan, nephew of Mrs. Kearns, joined the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1937 and succeeded Fitzpatrick as publisher in 1960, remaining as chairman until the merger with TCI, Inc. in 1997. The Kearns family owned a majority share of the newspaper until 1997, when the company merged with TCI in an effort to minimize inheritance tax liabilities borne by the two largest shareholders in the Kearns family. A buy-back agreement was put in place, providing for the Kearns family to reacquire &quot;The Tribune&quot;, after the IRS required a five-year holding period. However, in the interim TCI was merged with AT&amp;T Corporation. After intense pressure from the LDS Church, and intense counter-suits from the Kearns family, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was subsequently sold by AT&amp;T to Denver, Colorado-based MediaNews Group in 2000.

===21st century===
In 2000, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published a 3-part series on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, after a backhoe operator accidentally dug up previously-unknown remains while working on the 1999 Mountain Meadows Monument. The LDS Church&#x27;s displeasure at the articles&#x27; embarrassing disclosures has been alleged as motivation for its 2013 alleged attempt to silence the Tribune.

In 2002, the &quot;Tribune&quot; became mired in controversy after employees sold information related to the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case to &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;. &quot;Tribune&quot; editor James &quot;Jay&quot; Shelledy resigned from his job at the paper amid the fallout of the scandal. Two staffers were also removed from their positions as &quot;Tribune&quot; reporters.

In 2004 the paper decided to move from its historic location at the downtown Tribune building to The Gateway development. Many people, including several &quot;Tribune&quot; employees, opposed the move, stating that it would harm the economy of Salt Lake&#x27;s downtown. The move was completed in May 2005 and &quot;Tribune&quot; employees were told by editor Nancy Conway, &quot;It is just a building.&quot;

====Bankruptcy and alleged attempt to silence====

After emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, MediaNews Group lost control of its ownership to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. &quot;The remainder of the Denver-based chain is owned by a consortium of lenders and by Singleton himself.&quot; 

In 2013, rumors swirled of renegotiations to the 1952 Joint Operating Agreement with the Deseret News, which may have put the Salt Lake Tribune at a marked financial disadvantage, potentially eventually bankrupting the Tribune. An anonymous note, delivered in disguised handwriting to &quot;Tribune&quot; offices in October, alleged that the LDS Church was secretly negotiating with Alden for this aim. Interested parties and local citizens&#x27; activist groups subsequently organized, petitioned the US Department of Justice to become involved, and eventually filed a lawsuit alleging anti-trust violations. Critics of the church assert that the efforts to target the &quot;Tribune&quot; were done with the participation of the church&#x27;s First Presidency, its highest leadership body.

====Huntsman ownership====

On April 20, 2016, Huntsman Family Investments, LLC, a private equity firm controlled by Paul Huntsman, bought &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;. Paul Huntsman is the son of industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr. who is chairman of the holding company, and brother of former Utah governor and ambassador to China and later Russia Jon Huntsman Jr. 

In 2017, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for &quot;a string of vivid reports revealing the perverse, punitive and cruel treatment given to sexual assault victims at Brigham Young University, one of Utah’s most powerful institutions.&quot; The team included lead reporter Erin Alberty, managing editor Sheila R. McCann, reporters Jessica Miller and Alex Stuckey and editor-writer Rachel Piper. The package of winning stories also included an investigation into multiple reports that were not properly investigated by Utah State University.

In May 2018, the &quot;Tribune&quot; laid off over 38% of its newsroom staff, reducing headcount from ninety to fifty-six. This was the fourth round of layoffs since 2011, and the first under the leadership of owner and publisher Paul Huntsman. The reason put forward for this was lower revenue due to decreased circulation and lower profit from online advertisements. Huntsman said that in the two years since he bought the newspaper, advertising revenues had declined 40%.

==== Conversion to nonprofit ====
In November 2019 the newspaper won approval from the Internal Revenue Service to become a 501(c)(3) non-profit. It was the first major (and first daily) U.S. newspaper to become a nonprofit. 

In October 2020, the newspaper announced it would cease daily print publication at the end of the year, shifting instead to a weekly print product while maintaining a robust online presence. At the time, the paper had approximately 36,000 subscribers, a decline from a daily circulation of close to 200,000. Also in 2020, the &quot;Tribune&quot; ended its joint partnership with the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, which had lasted for sixty-eight years. 

From 2020 to 2021, the Tribune newsroom staff increased by 23%, with thirty-three reporters on staff in November 2021. The newly nonprofit paper also developed a variety of new projects.

In July 2024, newsroom employees announced their intentions to unionize with the Denver Newspaper Guild and Communications Workers of America. The bargaining unit would represent 31 employees.

==Endorsements==
In presidential elections, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; endorsed George W. Bush in 2004; Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012; and Hillary Clinton in 2016. The paper discontinued making endorsements for all offices (local, state, and national) in 2019 upon becoming a non-profit corporation as IRS rules forbid endorsements of candidates by 501(c)(3) non-profits.

<text>Embryons desséchés (&quot;Desiccated embryos&quot;) is a piano composition by Erik Satie, composed in the summer of 1913. The composition consists of three little movements, each taking about two to three minutes to play.

==The music==

The parts of the composition are:

1. &quot;(Desiccated embryo) of a Holothurian&quot; (30 June 1913), dedicated to Suzanne Roux:
:* See: sea cucumber. This type of animal has no eyes.
:* The music of this first part of the composition concentrates on the so-called &quot;purring&quot; of the holothurian, besides making fun of Loïsa Puget&#x27;s song &quot;Mon rocher de Saint-Malo&quot; (&quot;My rock of Saint-Malo&quot; – a then popular salon composition, which Satie had probably played numerous times in his cabaret pianist career). That this song is intended is already suggested by the introduction: Satie writes above the score, &quot;[...] I observed a Holothurian in the bay of Saint-Malo.&quot; Further he writes following remarks in the score, when &quot;quoting&quot; the melody of the song: &quot;What a nice rock!&quot; and the second time: &quot;That was a nice rock! How sticky!&quot;. Going &quot;submarine&quot; in a bay in Brittany, might also have been a wink from Satie to his (former) friend Debussy: three years earlier this composer had published the piano piece &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot; (&quot;Préludes&quot;, book I, No. 10), alluding to the legendary city of Ys, submersed in a bay in Brittany. There&#x27;s even a reproach implied: as friends, they had renounced &quot;romanticism&quot; in the late 19th century: since, Debussy apparently had turned to &quot;romanticised myths&quot; about submersed cities and the like, as a subject for his compositions. Satie&#x27;s statement is clear: he had remained true to himself, taking as subject for his composition something &quot;he had seen with his own eyes&quot;.

2. &quot;(Desiccated embryo) of an Edriophthalma&quot; (1 July 1913), dedicated to Edouard Dreyfus:
:* Edriophthalma, also known as Arthrostraca, are crustaceans with immobile eyes. In more modern taxonomies they belong to sub-groups of the Tetradecapoda (i.e. fourteen-legged crustaceans), e.g. Amphipoda (several kinds of usually &quot;small&quot; shrimp), and Isopoda (see e.g. this giant isopod or these woodlice).
:* It is not clear whether Satie had in mind any of these animals in particular, or that he just wanted to make reference to this group of crustaceans in general, for their &quot;underdog&quot;-like qualities (which he describes as &quot;subdue&quot; and &quot;morose&quot; in the score). In this part of the composition he makes fun of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March from his Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor (by the way calling it a &quot;famous mazurka by Schubert&quot;. In fact, Schubert composed no mazurkas).

3. &quot;(Desiccated embryo) of a Podophthalma&quot; (4 July 1913), dedicated to Jane Mortier:
:* Podophthalmia are stalk-eyed crustaceans, like crabs and lobsters (and various types of mostly &quot;larger&quot; shrimp), now grouped as Decapoda (i.e. ten-legged crustaceans).
:* In the score, Satie mentions the &quot;hunter&quot;-like qualities of podophthalmia, so the music is conceived as a miniature &quot;hunt&quot;. Hunts are a tradition in classical music, from early baroque keyboard music, over Vivaldi, several classical era composers and romantic opera composers to César Franck. Nonetheless, in music a hunting &quot;sea animal&quot; can be considered one of a kind.
:* Satie also points out that podophthalmia are delicious food: he was particularly fond of this kind of sea-food himself.
:* Satie concludes his triptych with a coda marked, &quot;Obligatory cadenza (by the composer.)&quot; Consisting, as it does, of more than half a page of &quot;fortissimo&quot; F-major chords and arpeggios, this grandiose flourish is incongruous with the modest proportions of the piece as a whole. It appears to be a pastiche of the end of Beethoven&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, and of Beethoven&#x27;s style, the &quot;endless coda&quot;.

==Orchestral version==
Composer/conductor Friedrich Cerha orchestrated Embryons desséchés for a 1970 recording of Satie&#x27;s orchestral music (CE 31018) by his ensemble, &quot;Die Reihe.&quot; This performance of Embryons desséchés features an actress reciting the narratives from Satie&#x27;s original score synchronously with the music, even though the composer disapproved of such a practice.

==The crustaceans==
In the 20th century both Edriophthalma and Podophthalmia would become classified in the Malacostraca class of the Crustacea subphylum of the Arthropoda phylum; the use of the terms &quot;Edriophthalma&quot; and &quot;Podophthalmia&quot; became obsolete with regard to the taxonomy of crustaceans.

As to the &quot;sources&quot; Satie might have had to make references to Podophthalmia and Edriophthalmata: in early evolutionary biology these crustaceans (and notably also their embryos) were studied by Fritz Müller, in his book &quot;Facts and Arguments for Darwin&quot;, published in German in 1863, and available in English in 1869. The images below are taken from the Project Gutenberg publication of that book (E-text N° 6475):
:&quot;From&quot; Chapter 8 — Developmental History of Edriophthalma:
:*&quot;Figure 36.&quot; Embryo of Ligia in the egg, magnified 15 diam. B. yelk; L. liver.
:*&quot;Figure 38.&quot; Embryo of a Philoscia in the egg, magnified 25 diam.

:&quot;From&quot; Chapter 7 — Developmental History of Podophthalma:
:*&quot;FIGURE 34.&quot; Embryo of a Squilla, magnified 45 diam. a. heart.

The book also shows other development stages of these animals (zoea, larva), even odder in shape.

<text>Driving simulators are used for entertainment as well as in training of driver&#x27;s education courses taught in educational institutions and private businesses. They are also used for research purposes in the area of human factors and medical research, to monitor driver behavior, performance, and attention and in the car industry to design and evaluate new vehicles or new advanced driver assistance systems.

== Training ==
Driving simulators are being increasingly used for training drivers. Versions exist for cars, trucks, buses, etc.

=== Uses ===
* Novice driver training and testing
* Professional driver training and testing
* Training in critical driving conditions
* Testing the effects of impairment on driver performance
* Analysis of the driver behaviours
* Analysis of driver responses
* Evaluating user performances in different conditions (handling of controls)
* Assessing fitness to drive for aging drivers
* Testing future in-vehicle technologies on drivers or passengers (Human -Machine Interface)
* entertainment and fun

=== Types ===
* Ambulance simulator: Used to train and assess ambulance drivers in basic and advanced vehicle control skills as well as how to respond to emergencies and interact with other emergency responders.
* Car simulator: Used to train and test novice drivers in all the skills required to pass a driver&#x27;s license road test as well as hazard perception and crash risk mitigation.
* Modular-design simulator: Interchangeable vehicle cabins or cockpits can be configured for use as tractor/trailer trucks, dump trucks and other construction vehicles, airport-operated vehicles, emergency response and police pursuit vehicles, buses, subway trains, passenger vehicles, and heavy equipment such as cranes.
* Multi-station driving simulator: This type of simulator enables one instructor to train more drivers at the same time thus saving time and reducing costs... These systems are equipped with instructor stations connected to control several driving simulators.
* Truck simulator: Used to train and assess novice and experienced truck drivers in skills ranging from basic control maneuvers, e.g. shifting and backing, to advanced skills, e.g. fuel efficiency, rollover prevention, defensive driving.
* Bus simulator: is used to train bus drivers on route familiarisation, safe driving techniques, fuel efficiency techniques. It can be used for training drivers on a variety of bus models and on different types of gear transmissions.
* Physical simulator: Large scale simulators employ Stewart platforms and xy tables to physically move the driver around in 6-axis space, simulating acceleration, braking and centripetal forces, similar to physical flight simulators.

== Entertainment ==
In the 1980s, it became a trend for arcade racing games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets. The trend was sparked by Sega&#x27;s &quot;taikan&quot; games, with &quot;taikan&quot; meaning &quot;body sensation&quot; in Japanese. The &quot;taikan&quot; trend began when Yu Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega (later known as Sega AM2) developed &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in-game actions. Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for later racing games such as &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986). Sega have since continued to manufacture motion simulator cabinets for arcade racing games through to the 2010s.

In 1991, Namco released the arcade game &quot;Mitsubishi Driving Simulator&quot;, co-developed with Mitsubishi. It was a serious educational street driving simulator that used 3D polygon technology and a sit-down arcade cabinet to simulate realistic driving, including basics such as ensuring the car is in neutral or parking position, starting the engine, placing the car into gear, releasing the hand-brake, and then driving. The player can choose from three routes while following instructions, avoiding collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians, and waiting at traffic lights; the brakes are accurately simulated, with the car creeping forward after taking the foot off the brake until the hand-brake is applied. &quot;Leisure Line&quot; magazine considered it the &quot;hit of the show&quot; upon its debut at the 1991 JAMMA show. It was designed for use by Japanese driving schools, with a very expensive cost of AU$150,000 or per unit.

Advances in processing power have led to more realistic simulators known as sim racing games on home systems, beginning with Papyrus Design Group&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;IndyCar Racing&quot; (1993) and &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; (1998) for PC and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (1997) for home consoles.

Occasionally, a racing game or driving simulator will also include an attachable steering wheel that can be used to play the game in place of a controller. The wheel, which is usually plastic, may also include pedals to add to the game&#x27;s reality. These wheels are usually used only for arcade and computer games.

In addition to the myriad commercial releases there is a bustling community of amateur coders working on closed and open source free simulators. Some of the major features popular with fans of the genre are online racing, realism and diversity of cars and tracks.

== Research ==
Driving simulators are used at research facilities for many purposes. Many vehicle manufacturers operate driving simulators, e.g. BMW, Ford, Renault. Many universities also operate simulators for research. Driving simulators allow researchers to study driver training issues and driver behavior under conditions in which it would be illegal and/or unethical to place drivers. For instance, studies of driver distraction would be dangerous and unethical (because of the inability to obtain informed consent from other drivers) to do on the road.

With the increasing use of various in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) such as satellite navigation systems, cell phones, DVD players and e-mail systems, simulators are playing an important rule in assessing the safety and utility of such devices.

=== Fidelity ===
There exists a number of types research driving simulators, with a wide range of capabilities. The most complex, like the National Advanced Driving Simulator, have a full-sized vehicle body, with six-axis movement and 360-degree visual displays. On the other end of the range are simple desktop simulators that are often implemented using a computer monitor for the visual display and a videogame-type steering wheel and pedal input devices. These low cost simulators are used readily in the evaluation of basic and clinically oriented scientific questions.
The issue is complicated by political and economic factors, as facilities with low-fidelity simulators claim their systems are &quot;good enough&quot; for the job, while the high-fidelity simulator groups insist that their (considerably more expensive) systems are necessary. Research into motion fidelity indicates that, while some motion is necessary in a research driving simulator, it does not need to have enough range to match real-world forces. Recent research has also considered the use of the real-time photo-realistic video content that reacts dynamically to driver behaviour in the environment.

=== Validity ===
There is a question of validity—whether results obtained in the simulator are applicable to real-world driving. One review of research studies found that driver behavior on a driving simulator approximates (relative validity) but does not exactly replicate (absolute validity) on-road driving behavior. Another study found absolute validity for the types and number of driver errors committed on a simulator and on the road. Yet another study found that drivers who reported impaired performance on a low fidelity driving simulator were significantly more likely to take part in an accident in which the driver was at least partially at fault, within five years after the simulator session. Some research teams are using automated vehicles to recreate simulator studies on a test track, enabling a more direct comparison between the simulator study and the real world. As computers have grown faster and simulation is more widespread in the automotive industry, commercial vehicle math models that have been validated by manufacturers are seeing use in simulators.

<doc id="985189" wikidata="Q131992" url="?curid=985189" title="Atherospermataceae">
<text>The Atherospermataceae, commonly known as the southern sassafrases, are a family of broadleaf evergreen trees and shrubs. The family includes 14 species in seven genera. The atherosperms are today mostly distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, with two species native to southern Chile and 12 species native to Australasia. Wood is commercially harvested from rainforest species of this family, and is used both in construction and in fine cabinet making.

==Ecology==
These trees and shrubs are characteristic of the lower strata of the tropical rainforest, except &quot;Dryadodaphne&quot; species, which belong to the rainforest high canopy. The glands at the base of the stamens secrete nectar in &quot;Laurelia novae-zelandiae&quot;, which accumulates at the base of the flower and attracts bees, beetles and bee flies. The seed, in the form of a feathery achene, is dispersed by wind (anemochory).

The wood of &quot;Laurelia&quot; has local interest for construction, particularly the Chilean &quot;Laurelia sempervirens&quot;, despite its lack of resistance to moisture. Essential oils extracted from the leaves and bark of species of &quot;Doryphora&quot; have application in perfumery and pharmaceuticals.

==Evolution==
The Atherospermataceae have in the past been treated as a subfamily (Atherospermatoideae) of the Monimiaceae. Recent reassessment of both morphological and molecular characters, however, show them to be more clearly related to the Gomortegaceae and Siparunaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website considers them to be a family of their own (as the Atherospermataceae), and together with the Gomortegaceae and Siparunaceae form a distinct branch of the Laurales.

A clade made up of &quot;Doryphora&quot; and &quot;Daphnandra&quot;, from the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales, is considered sister to the rest of the family. The remaining genera (&quot;Atherosperma&quot;, &quot;Dryadodaphne&quot;, &quot;Laurelia&quot;, &quot;Laureliopsis&quot;, and &quot;Nemuaron&quot;) are considered by some to be more advanced evolutionarily.

The atherosperm fossil record, which goes back to the Upper Cretaceous, includes pollen, wood, and leaf fossils from Europe, Africa, South America, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Tasmania. The family is recognized in Antarctic fossils from the Cretaceous to the lower Tertiary (about 88 Mya). Fossil pollen of &quot;Laurelia&quot; has been attributed to the middle Oligocene of New Zealand, as well as the Eocene-Oligocene and Early Miocene of Argentina and Seymour Island. Calibration of rbcL substitution rates within the fossils suggests an initial diversification of the family at 100–140 Mya, probably in West Gondwana, early entry into Antarctica, and long-distance dispersal to New Zealand and New Caledonia at 50–30 Mya by the ancestors of &quot;Laurelia novae-zelandiae&quot; and &quot;Nemuaron&quot;.

<text>John Richard Owens (7 January 1956 – 4 November 1980) was a Welsh professional boxer who fought under the name Johnny Owen. His seemingly fragile appearance earned him many epithets, including the &quot;Merthyr Matchstick&quot; and the &quot;Bionic Bantam&quot;. He began boxing at the age of eight and undertook a long amateur career, competing in more than 120 fights and representing Wales in competitions. He turned professional in September 1976 at the age of 20, winning his debut bout against George Sutton. Owen beat Sutton again in his sixth professional fight to win his first title, the vacant bantamweight title in the Welsh Area.

Owen challenged for the British bantamweight title in his tenth professional fight in 1977. He defeated champion Paddy Maguire in the eleventh round to win the title, becoming the first Welshman in more than 60 years to hold the belt. Owen recorded five further victories, including a defence of his British title against Wayne Evans, before meeting Paul Ferreri for the Commonwealth bantamweight title. He defeated the experienced Australian on points to claim the Commonwealth title and challenged Juan Francisco Rodríguez for the European title four months later. The fight in Almería, Spain, was shrouded in controversy and Owen suffered his first defeat in a highly contentious decision.

Owen went on to win seven consecutive bouts within a year to rechallenge Rodríguez in February 1980. He avenged his earlier defeat by beating Rodríguez on points to win the European title. He challenged World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Lupe Pintor for his world bantamweight title on 19 September 1980, losing the contest by way of a twelfth round knockout after being knocked down for the third time. Owen left the ring on a stretcher and never regained consciousness. He fell into a coma and died seven weeks later in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 24.

Owen possessed a professional career record of 25 wins (11 by knockout), 1 draw and 2 defeats. His only career losses came against Rodríguez and Pintor. He remains revered in the South Wales Valleys where he was raised, particularly in his hometown of Merthyr Tydfil where a statue commemorating his life and career was unveiled in 2002.

==Early life==
Johnny Owen was born John Richard Owens at Gwaunfarren Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on 7 January 1956, the fourth of eight children to working-class parents Dick and Edith Owens (née Hale). He had four brothers, Phillip, Vivian, Kelvin and Dilwyn, and three sisters, Marilyn, Susan and Shereen. The Owens family hailed from Llanidloes but moved south, settling in the village of Penwaunfawr, on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil. His paternal grandmother worked in the local mines while his grandfather Will worked in an ironworks and was an amateur boxer. His mother was born in Merthyr Tydfil, although her family hailed from Lydney in Gloucestershire, where her father had worked as a farmer. His mother&#x27;s side of the family were of Irish ancestry. Both sets of Owen&#x27;s ancestors had moved to the South Wales Valleys in search of work with increased steel, iron and coal production attracting workers from all over Britain. Owen&#x27;s parents settled in a rented council house in Heol Bryn Selu on Gellideg housing estate in Merthyr.

In his 2006 biography of Owen, Rick Broadbent described an adolescent Owen as &quot;a sensitive, quiet soul, he was deeply in tune with the moods and needs of those close to him.&quot; Owen attended the local school, Gellideg Juniors. A mild-mannered child, he was described by his teachers as a &quot;quiet, hardworking, and very good-natured and well-behaved pupil&quot;. By the age of seven, he was doing the family&#x27;s weekly shop and his father later recalled that, when the family was infected by a flu virus, Owen &quot;fed us soup and made sure we all had our medicine. He looked after us.&quot; Owen&#x27;s father worked as a miner for 13 years but eventually secured a job as a moulder at a boot-making factory owned by Dunlop. His wife had suffered complications during the birth of the couple&#x27;s seventh child and her health deteriorated so much that she was hospitalised for an extended period. Owen&#x27;s father nearly placed his children into care to continue working but reversed his decision after receiving assurances that he would not lose his job.

==Amateur career==
Owen began to box at the age of eight, idolising fellow Merthyr-born boxer Jimmy Wilde. Along with his siblings Vivian and Kelvin, in the spring of 1962, he joined the Merthyr Amateur Boxing Club housed in a small hut on nearby Plymouth Street. Broadbent describes how, by age ten, Owen developed &quot;some rudimentary ring craft and already had the boundless energy that would be his signature... His punches were light but his effort huge.&quot; Owen and the other members of his club travelled the country, competing against youth clubs from Wales and England. Each year culminated in the Welsh amateur championships, a junior event which stipulated that a fighter must have gained each year they entered. Martyn Galleozzie, who trained alongside Owen, noted how Owen struggled to achieve the weight increase each year and was fed cakes and biscuits on the journey to try and make weight. Galleozzie also stated how his mother once sewed lead into the lining of Owen&#x27;s shorts to make weight.

Owen joined Hoover Amateur Boxing Club soon after, where he trained with Idris Sutton and modelled his fighting style on Eddie Thomas. Owen was a quiet, reserved, friendly character outside the ring and often needed to be coaxed into fighting full force. In his youth, he suffered a loss to future WBC flyweight champion Charlie Magri in a bout in Gurnos. Owen attended Georgetown Secondary Modern School until the age of 16 when he left to take up a role as a machine operator in a local Suko nuts and bolts manufacturing factory. His exertions in the factory, coupled with his frequent runs in the hills of the South Wales Valleys with his brother Kelvin, led Owen to develop renowned levels of speed and stamina. His job however caused him health issues as the swarf from the factory led to Owen developing infections on occasion. A septic finger injury led to a lacklustre defeat to George Sutton in the 1975 Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (ABA) Championships after Owen refused to pull out of the fight.

In November 1973, Owen was invited to fight Welsh amateur champion Bryn Griffiths after his opponent had fallen ill and pulled out of a bout. Despite the short notice, Owen was confident of his ability to make the step up against Griffiths and was proved right when he recorded a points victory over the champion. Griffiths later won a rematch between the pair.
At the age of 18, Owen met Maurice O&#x27;Sullivan for the 1974 Welsh ABA youth title in O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s hometown of Cardiff after reaching the final of the tournament on 4 April. Despite Owen and his father being convinced of his victory, the judges awarded the fight to O&#x27;Sullivan who himself offered the trophy to Owen, although he refused to accept it. Owen&#x27;s father Dick later stated that an official from the Welsh ABA approached him after the fight and confessed how the organisation had been under pressure to ensure O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s victory in order for him to be selected for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games in New Zealand. Owen&#x27;s father was becoming an increasing influence on his son&#x27;s training especially when the two trainers at Owen&#x27;s gym began suffering ill-health. When Dick was unable to take training, Owen would run the sessions at the gym for local fighters.

Owen represented Wales at amateur level several times; his performance in a 1974 tournament between Wales and Scotland drew praise in the local press. After defeating John Raeside in the second round during their bout in Pontypool, he was described as reducing his opponent &quot;to helplessness with a non-stop two-fisted assault&quot; and was chosen as the most impressive fighter in the two teams on the night. Owen became well-known for his seemingly small, thin frame as he grew older; he was chosen to represent Wales in a contest against Sweden in February 1975 and was greeted with jeers and laughter when he removed his robe. The nickname &quot;Matchstick Man&quot; was coined at the event as Owen comfortably stopped his opponent in the second round. Having initially boxed as a featherweight, Owen began fighting in the heavier bantamweight class soon after and won his first bout at the weight against Englishman Allan Smith of the Metropolitan Police Amateur Boxing Club. His physique attracted further attention in November 1975; while representing Wales against an army team, a doctor initially refused to pass him fit to fight believing him to be too frail to box. After his father intervened, the fight went ahead and Owen won on points.

Owen enjoyed a lengthy amateur boxing career, taking in some 124 fights. He won 106 bouts in his amateur career, losing the remaining 18. He represented Wales at amateur level 19 times, suffering defeat on only two occasions. One of his victories came over 1974 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist John Bambrick. His amateur career ended on two disappointing notes; he suffered defeat in his Welsh senior amateur title fight against Jimmy Evans before losing his last amateur fight against Paul Chance.

==Professional career==
===Early fights and Welsh bantamweight title===
Owen turned professional on 1 September 1976, signing with New Tredegar-based manager Dai Gardiner along with another fighter, Billy Vivian. The decision to turn professional prompted a change of name; Owen had been fighting under his given name as an amateur but was advised by his new management that a ring name would benefit his career. Owen&#x27;s initial suggestion was Sion Rhisart Owain, the Welsh translation of his given name, although he was dissuaded from this option as it was deemed too political. His brother Kelvin instead suggested adopting the name Johnny Owen. Owen&#x27;s initial aspirations were low, Kelvin stated how Owen had turned professional with the ultimate aim of claiming a British title or a Lonsdale Belt. Nonetheless, Owen was driven to turn professional by a desire to support his family and escape his relatively poor upbringing. One of his former youth coaches stated his belief that Owen understood he could &quot;fight and make money for his family. He wanted to buy them a house but, really, ... the reason he boxed was because he had to.&quot;

His debut match ended with a one-point victory over fellow Welshman George Sutton, at Pontypool Leisure Centre, on 30 September; at the time, Sutton was ranked as the number three contender for the British title and had needed a challenger on short notice. His victory earned him his first professional purse of £125 (around £920 in 2021). The decision to fight an already established opponent proved astute as victory immediately saw Owen&#x27;s standing rise in the boxing community. After his debut bout, Owen and his team agreed that he would not date during his professional career, with Owen believing that the dedication required to his career would be unfair on both him and his partner. His second fight was against Northern Irishman Neil McLaughlin in his opponent&#x27;s home nation during the height of The Troubles. The card suffered several interruptions: there were angry outbursts when British soldiers entered the arena, a bomb threat was phoned in against the site and, during Owen&#x27;s bout, the lights failed for several minutes. The fight ended in a controversial draw. Owen finished his first year as a professional by comfortably defeating Englishman Ian Murray in Tonypandy. He knocked Murray down twice before the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round.

At the start of the following year, Owen met McLaughlin in a rematch in West Bromwich. Away from his opponent&#x27;s home nation, the fight proved a more one-sided affair as Owen secured an 80–76 points victory. This led promoter Heddwyn Taylor to raise the idea of Owen challenging reigning champion George Sutton for the Welsh bantamweight title. Although Owen had already beaten Sutton as a professional, the request was denied by the Welsh Area Boxing Council who deemed that he was too inexperienced. Unable to challenge for the title, Owen&#x27;s promoters found themselves in need of an opponent and could only secure another rematch with McLaughlin. Even though Owen and his trainers voiced their displeasure over the bout, he went on to defeat McLaughlin for a second time in February. The Welsh Area Boxing Council reconsidered its decision and allowed a title fight between Owen and Sutton to go ahead on 29 March, with the bout regarded as an eliminator for the British title. The fight was an even contest in the early rounds until Owen rocked Sutton in the fifth with a right hook. Owen&#x27;s stamina gave him a distinct advantage as the fight wore on and he emerged victorious with a 99–97 points victory to become Welsh bantamweight champion. It was from his Welsh title win that Owen gained another of his nicknames, the &quot;Bionic Bantam&quot;, after a reporter for the &quot;Western Mail&quot; likened him to Steve Austin from &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;.

===British bantamweight title===
Owen&#x27;s championship win resulted in him becoming a possible challenger for the British bantamweight champion Paddy Maguire. To move into contention, Owen was booked to fight Scottish bantamweight champion Johnny Kellie at the Albany Hotel in Glasgow. It was widely believed that the winner would be booked as Maguire&#x27;s next opponent. During the fight Owen became infuriated with Kellie&#x27;s tactics as his opponent relied on holding to waste time, when Owen was gaining the advantage, and he believed the referee was not penalising Kellie for it. Further issues were raised when Owen lost his gumshield and the referee forced him to continue without it. Owen was spurred on by these irritations and knocked Kellie down twice in quick succession before the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round. When the offer of a British title fight with Maguire failed to materialise, Owen instead fought debutant fighter Terry Hanna at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre in June 1977, defeating him with a fourth-round knockout. Further disappointment followed as Maguire took a fight against Franco Zurlo in September of the same year, leaving Owen with an offer of a second rematch against George Sutton on only three days&#x27; notice. The fight took place at Midland Social Club in Solihull and Sutton proved a sterner test than most had anticipated in the early rounds, landing a
strong punch to Owen&#x27;s jaw that wobbled him. Owen was able to recover and won the fight on points.

Despite Owen&#x27;s victories, it still seemed likely that he would be forced to wait for a match with Maguire. However, when the official challenger Wayne Evans declined the opportunity to fight Maguire, stating that he needed more experience, Owen stepped in and the fight was scheduled for November 1977 at the National Sporting Club in London. Maguire was entering the fight on a three-fight losing streak, having suffered defeats to Heleno Ferreira and Alberto Sandoval before unsuccessfully challenging Zurlo for the European bantamweight championship, and Owen was expected to be a serious threat to the Irishman&#x27;s two-year reign. Owen edged the early rounds of the fight as his longer reach caused Maguire problems and the champion was warned on more than one occasion for use of the head and low blows. Already ahead on points, Owen dominated the eighth round and nearly knocked down Maguire. Such was Owen&#x27;s dominance, Maguire&#x27;s promoter Mickey Duff threatened to end the fight. The champion rallied in the ninth round but the referee stopped the fight in the eleventh after Owen had opened a large cut above Maguire&#x27;s eye. In only his tenth professional bout, Owen was crowned the British bantamweight champion at the age of 21, becoming the first Welsh fighter to hold the title since Bill Beynon in 1913. He was awarded the belt by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, while Maguire subsequently announced his retirement from boxing.

Owen&#x27;s victory brought him a new found level of fame to which the young fighter was unaccustomed. On his return to Merthyr the day after the fight, he met with the town&#x27;s mayor and two parties were held in his honour in local clubs. He was named Welsh Boxer of the Year for 1977 and finished fourth in voting for the 1977 BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year. Owen returned to the ring in January 1978 in a non-title fight against Scottish boxer Alan Oag, defeating his opponent in the eighth round. A month later, Owen fought Antonio Medina at Marton Country Club near Newcastle and was surprised early on when his opponent emerged as a southpaw, the first time he had faced a fighter using the stance in his career. Owen&#x27;s team had neglected to research their opponent ahead of the bout and the initial surprise caught Owen off-guard. Even so, he emerged victorious on points.

Owen&#x27;s first defence of his British title was booked for 6 April 1978 at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre against fellow Welshman Wayne Evans. The two fighters possessed near identical records; both entered the bout 11–0 with Owen also recording a draw. The fight was eagerly anticipated as it was both the first time the British bantamweight title had been contested in Wales and the first time it had featured two Welsh fighters. Owen was the stronger of the pair in the opening four rounds and Evans was hampered by a knuckle injury that had plagued his career. In the fifth round, Evans caught Owen with a punch that ruptured his eardrum and caused bleeding from the ear. Despite being almost unable to hear on one side, Owen took control of the fight after the fifth round and wore Evans down, eventually knocking him down in the ninth. Evans made it back to his feet for the end of the round but the start of the tenth saw Owen continue his assault, stopping Evans early in the round to successfully defend his title.

===Commonwealth bantamweight title===
In June 1978 Owen fought twice, defeating Dave Smith on points at the National Sporting Club before stopping Davy Larmour in the seventh round of a fight at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly two weeks later. The possibility of Owen competing for either the Commonwealth or European bantamweight titles was being raised and he received an offer of between £2000–2500 to fight the reigning Commonwealth champion, Ghanaian Sulley Shittu, in his opponent&#x27;s home country. Shittu, however, was stripped of the title by the Commonwealth Championship Committee soon after having failed to meet a challenger in the required time. Australian Paul Ferreri, who had lost the belt to Shittu in January 1977, stated his willingness to contest the vacant Commonwealth title with Owen, offering the Welshman £4,000, on the stipulation that the fight be held in his home country. Owen rejected the offer over the distance and fears that partisan Australian judges could make the fight unwinnable. He instead met Englishman Wally Angliss, stopping him in the third round after Angliss had suffered a deep cut above his left eye.

Eager for the fight to go ahead, Ferreri dropped his request for the fight to be based in Australia and accepted a bout with Owen in Ebbw Vale on 2 November 1978. Ferreri was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;world class opposition, such as Owen has never faced before.&quot; A former holder of the Commonwealth title, he entered the fight with nearly 70 professional bouts to Owen&#x27;s 16 and had never been beaten by a British fighter. Ferreri proved a stern test for Owen, with his counter-punching style causing the Welshman problems in the opening rounds. By the eleventh round of the fifteen-round contest, &quot;The Times&quot; judged the fight to be &quot;fascinatingly poised&quot; but Owen&#x27;s renowned stamina and the eight-year age gap proved telling as he was described as &quot;covering the last four rounds of the fight like a sprinter&quot;. The referee awarded the fight 148–145 in Owen&#x27;s favour and both fighters received plaudits from the capacity crowd; Ferreri was given a standing ovation by the largely Welsh crowd and Owen was carried to the dressing room on the shoulders of his team in celebration. Both Owen and the fight received several plaudits in annual award ceremonies, including Owen being named Best Young Fighter by the Boxing Writers&#x27; Club, becoming only the third Welshman after Howard Winstone and Dai Dower to receive the award. Owen was also named BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year for 1978, becoming the first boxer to win the award since Winstone more than a decade earlier.

===European bantamweight title challenge===

Owen&#x27;s victory led him to challenge for the division&#x27;s European title, held by Juan Francisco Rodríguez of Spain. The fight was originally scheduled for the end of 1978 but Rodríguez withdrew from the bout due to a case of flu, and it was rearranged for three months later. It was Owen&#x27;s eighteenth contest and his first overseas, taking place in the champion&#x27;s hometown of Almería. The fight was preceded by a series of allegations of foul play by Owen&#x27;s camp. He was promised the use of the same training facilities as the champion in the afternoons, once Rodríguez had finished his sessions. In practice, however, Owen and his team often found themselves waiting at the gym for Rodríguez to finish his training, taking up hours of Owen&#x27;s sessions. At the weigh-in, Owen was marginally overweight, prompting a last minute training session involving running up and down the hotel stairs until he hit the limit. Rodríguez also exceeded the weight limit by a larger margin, more than could be lost in the allowed time. Owen and his team returned to the hotel with the intent of returning to Britain, believing the fight would be called off. However, Owen&#x27;s manager Dai Gardiner returned to announce that the Spanish officials had passed Rodríguez fit to fight despite having weighed in overweight. Owen decided to go ahead with the bout, eager not to return to Britain empty-handed. Gardiner also held concerns over local judges heading into the fight and predicted that, in order to win, Owen would have to stop his opponent.

The fight was held in the town&#x27;s bullring in front of a capacity crowd and Owen entered the arena to loud jeers. The first round was relatively uneventful as both fighters settled. When Owen returned to his corner, his father was infuriated after smelling wintergreen oil on Owen. Believing the substance came from Rodríguez&#x27;s gloves, he approached the referee who ignored Dick Owens&#x27; complaints. The British Boxing Board of Control&#x27;s (BBBofC) representative at the fight, Harry Vines, attempted to approach Owen&#x27;s team to find out what was causing commotion and found himself being pushed and shoved by members of the crowd before Spanish police ordered him to return to his seat. Rodríguez used several underhand manoeuvres against Owen, including illegal use of the head and elbows and attempted to screw his thumb into Owen&#x27;s eye, eventually receiving an official warning from the referee in the twelfth round after being reprimanded on several occasions. At the start of the tenth round, Owen returned to the middle of the ring but was forced to wait as Rodríguez took several extra minutes to leave his corner before standing to taunt his opponent in front of the home crowd. Rodríguez was awarded the victory on points in a decision that Steve Bunce later declared: &quot;In what has been regarded as a &#x27;home-town decision travesty&#x27;, Rodríguez was awarded a fight he had so obviously lost.&quot; The &quot;Dictionary of Welsh Biography&quot; went further and described the decision as &quot;an insult to the good name of boxing&quot;.

Owen and his team returned to Wales despondent and infuriated. Their ire was further increased when the Spanish Boxing Federation withheld £1,200 from Owen&#x27;s fee in retaliation for an incident the previous year when a Spanish boxer had been deducted pay for retiring from a fight in Britain. The Welsh Area Boxing Council held an investigation into the fight, during which Vines described the incident as &quot;the worst decision he&#x27;d ever experienced&quot;. However, the council had no power over Spanish promoters and there was no alternative for Owen other than to accept the loss, although the BBBofC did refund Owen the money that been deducted from his paycheck. Gardiner arranged a high-profile bout with American Jose Gonzalez in an attempt to immediately showcase Owen internationally again but the fight was postponed when Gonzalez failed to make weight. With Owen ready to fight, Lee Graham was named as a late replacement but was little match for Owen who won on points. A more experienced opponent was arranged a month later, Frenchman Guy Caudron who had won 35 of his 49 career fights proved more of a test for Owen. Caudron lasted 12 rounds but was defeated 99–97 on points. Despite having fought in 19 professional bouts, it was only after the Caudron fight that Owen left his job at the Suko factory as his boxing schedule became too hectic to continue working. Owen made his first defence of his Commonwealth title and his third of his British title in June 1979 against Dave Smith, an opponent he had beaten the previous year, at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly. Owen was eager to impress in the fight as victory would also see him achieve a lifelong ambition of retaining a Lonsdale Belt, which became the permanent property of a fighter once they had completed three successful defences. From the first round he dominated Smith, whose trainer eventually threw in the towel during the twelfth round. By now, Owen had set his sights on a rematch with Rodríguez for the European title. He met Neil McLaughlin for a fourth time on 17 September 1979 at the Albany Hotel in Glasgow and recorded a comfortable 100–95 points victory to secure his 20th professional win.

A fight against American Isaac Vega was booked for 4 October of the same year. When Owen and his team arrived at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre for the bout they found that Vega had pulled out of the contest without warning and the American promoters instead offered a replacement, Jose Garcia. Owen&#x27;s camp knew nothing of the new opponent but went along with the change to provide Owen with much needed competition. Garcia had only fought professionally once before, losing by knockout in the first round more than a year before. Garcia provided little competition for Owen with the referee stopping the fight in the fifth round.

===Rematch with Rodríguez===
Owen ended 1979 with one further victory over American David Vasquez, a fighter who had unsuccessfully challenged world champion Lupe Pintor a year earlier and had been in line to meet Wilfredo Gómez. Although he provided a challenge for Owen, Vasquez ultimately lost to the Welshman on points. The victory put Owen in contention for a rematch against Rodríguez and the fight was confirmed at the start of 1980, due for the early months of the year. Two weeks later Owen fought fellow Welshman Glyn Davies at the National Sporting Club. Davies was described as a &quot;tough old pro&quot; who had fought over 40 times professionally but he lasted only five rounds before the referee stopped the fight in Owen&#x27;s favour. After the bout, Davies remarked: &quot;I have been beaten by the next world champion.&quot; Owen decided to invest some of his earnings by purchasing a shop on Galon Uchaf housing estate in his hometown of Merthyr.

Owen and his camp were enthusiastic when their promoter offered them a rematch with Rodríguez for the European title. Rodríguez was short of competitors willing to fight in his home country and was forced to accept the Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre to secure a large prize fund. The venue was filled to capacity, with more than 1,800 spectators. The fight started slowly and Rodríguez restricted the early pace of the opening rounds by holding Owen on the blindside of the referee. Rodríguez continued a defensive, counter-punching style and caught Owen several times as the Welshman continually advanced, attempting to push the pace between the fifth and eighth rounds. Owen did cause damage to his opponent after trapping him on the ropes during the sixth. As Rodríguez tired, Owen continued his pattern of pressing him around the ring and controlled the remaining rounds of the fight. The three judges awarded Owen a unanimous victory to crown him European bantamweight champion.

===Final bout===
With Owen the European champion, a fight against the WBC title holder, Mexican Lupe Pintor was reported to be under consideration. However, Owen&#x27;s next fight was confirmed as a British and Commonwealth title defence against Englishman John Feeney at Empire Pool in London. Owen did not consider Feeney at the same level as Ferreri or Rodríguez, but with an 18–0 record, Feeney was an upcoming prospect in British boxing. Feeney started spritely in the opening rounds but Owen&#x27;s relentless pressure wore down the opposition fighter and he emerged victorious with a comfortable win on points. In its report of the fight, &quot;The Times&quot; described fighting Owen as like &quot;trying to beat a carpet, so resilient is he... the carpet ends up by giving you a dusting.&quot;

Ranked as the number four bantamweight in the world by the WBC, Owen was offered a lucrative title fight against Pintor by promoter Mickey Duff. The two parties had discussed a potential meeting in Wales, an option to which Pintor was open, but promoters in the country could not match the purse offered by American promoters and the fight was held in Los Angeles. Owen stated that, should he win the fight, his plan was to defend the belt three times before retiring to Merthyr. Pintor had edged a highly controversial split decision over stablemate and long-time champion Carlos Zárate to win his world bantamweight title in June 1978. Zárate retired in disgust following the decision, but Pintor proved to be an able successor and had defended his title twice heading into the fight. Owen arrived in Los Angeles a week before the fight to acclimatise to the humidity. Both Owen and Pintor would go for early morning runs in the local area and would sometimes pass in a nearby park without acknowledging each other. Both fighters trained at the gym facilities in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Owen found the press intrusion from the Mexican reporters difficult to deal with; he was hounded everywhere during the day and his motel room phone rang so often that Dai Gardiner requested the motel block any incoming calls. Eventually, Owen snapped and threatened to disrupt the fight schedule unless action was taken. The fight promoter promptly intervened and the press backed off.

The bout was held at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, Los Angeles, on 19 September 1980. The arena had a capacity of 10,000 but estimates have put the crowd at well beyond that. The crowd was predominantly Mexican, with Pintor receiving fervent support. While some Welsh fans had travelled to support Owen they were said to be &quot;outnumbered 100 to 1 at least&quot;. Owen was considered the underdog with odds on his victory being offered at 6–1 before the fight, but he surprised many in the opening round by actively pursuing Pintor around the ring, seeking to engage with the champion. His pressure was rewarded in the third and fourth rounds, both of which he won on most observers&#x27; scorecards, although Pintor responded with some strong right hands. Pintor began to realise that Owen was a considerable threat, perhaps more than he had anticipated, and responded in the fourth by landing a strong shot to Owen, although the Welshman quickly shook it off. In the fifth round, Owen suffered a large cut to the inside of his bottom lip that began to bleed profusely, leaving him swallowing blood for the remainder of the fight. The ringside doctor and the referee inspected the cut but deemed Owen was fit to continue.

Pintor looked to take control of the fight and was the stronger through rounds six to eight, although he did receive cuts to both eyes. By this stage in the fight most observers judged the fight to be evenly poised, with some even giving Owen a slight lead. Pintor began to fight more aggressively in the ninth round and his approach paid off when he caught Owen with a punch that knocked the Welshman down for the first time in his professional career. Owen got to his feet quickly and assured the referee that he was fine but the momentum of the fight moved in the champion&#x27;s direction and from the tenth round Pintor was in the ascendency. An exhausted Owen battled on through the eleventh round and referee Marty Denkin approached Owen&#x27;s corner to end the fight but was told he was fine to continue. Owen returned for the twelfth and was knocked down a second time but again got to his feet. With 25 seconds remaining in the round, Pintor caught Owen with a strong right hand to the head and Owen crumpled to the floor. The referee immediately called an end to the fight rather than count Owen out, stating he had seen Owen&#x27;s pupils go up into his head, indicating he was unconscious before he fell to the floor. Owen suffered convulsions in the ring as doctors treated him and blood poured from his mouth. The crowd showed little sympathy for Owen&#x27;s condition; beer and other debris were thrown into the ring and Owen&#x27;s corner men were shoved and pushed as they attempted to aid their fighter. Ken Bryant, a member of Owen&#x27;s team, had his wallet pickpocketed from his coat as he attended to the stricken fighter. Owen was loaded onto a stretcher and carried out of the arena before being taken to California Hospital Medical Center. He was taken into surgery, where doctors removed a blood clot from his brain after a three-hour operation. The BBC regarded the knockout as so disturbing that it cancelled its replay broadcast of the fight in the UK and instead aired an edited highlights segment.

==Death==

The hospital where Owen was treated received more than 100 calls and telegrams from well-wishers within the first 24 hours after the fight. Owen&#x27;s mother arrived in the United States a day later. The neurosurgeon in charge of Owen revealed how they had discovered that Owen possessed both an unusually delicate skull and a strong jaw. As a result, Pintor&#x27;s punch had inadvertently pushed Owen&#x27;s jawbone through his skull and into his brain, causing irreparable damage. Owen underwent a second operation soon after to relieve pressure on his brain but soon contracted pneumonia. Once this had cleared, a third surgery was required but Owen remained unconscious. Although his doctor believed his condition was improving, a second bout of pneumonia on 4 November ultimately ended his life at 24 years old with his parents by his bedside.

Owen&#x27;s body was returned to Wales where he was held in Merthyr Parish Church. The coffin was kept in a public area and thousands of visitors attended the church to pay tribute to Owen. His funeral ceremony was held at High Street Baptist Church. The church held around 1,000 people while around 4,000 waited outside where the ceremony was broadcast through loudspeakers. He was buried in Pant Cemetery in Merthyr on 11 November. Hundreds of floral tributes were sent on the day, including from Muhammad Ali and singer Tom Jones. The Secretary of State for Wales, Nicholas Edwards, sent a telegram to Owen&#x27;s family in which he proclaimed &quot;All Wales is saddened to hear of Johnny Owen&#x27;s death&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the entire town of Merthyr &quot;closed&quot; on the day of his funeral. Pintor was devastated by the death of Owen and contemplated retiring from boxing. The Owens family held no malice towards Pintor and absolved him of any blame for Owen&#x27;s death. They sent him messages of support after the fight and encouraged the Mexican fighter to continue boxing.

The WBC claimed that Owen had been insured for $50,000, but this later proved to be false as the payments were capped at $25,000 that would first be put towards medical expenses. The cost of Owen&#x27;s treatment was $94,000, more than three times the insurance payout. The remaining medical bills were paid by a public appeal that raised $128,000 for Owen, with his family donating the remaining money to charity. In his will, Owen left £45,189 to his family, having earned less than £7,000 for his title fight with Pintor after expenses. Owen&#x27;s death, along with those of Kim Deuk-koo and Francisco Bejines in the early 1980s, ultimately led to boxing title fights being fought over 12 instead of 15 rounds in an attempt to improve the safety of fighters.

==Fighting style==

Owen was renowned for his dedication to boxing, training relentlessly and often doing more work than his trainers asked of him. His dedication was such that he never drank alcohol and it is widely believed that he abstained from romantic relationships. This led to Hugh McIlvanney of &quot;The Observer&quot; labelling Owen as &quot;The Virgin Soldier&quot; in 1979. Owen&#x27;s training involved running considerable distances, between on normal days, contributing to his thin physique. Owen&#x27;s manager, Dai Gardiner, was accused of starving Owen to maintain his leanness and allow him to compete at bantamweight.

His stamina was regarded as inexhaustible; Winford Jones, a boxing writer and former referee, described Owen: &quot;His great skill wasn&#x27;t his strength – though he never took a backwards step and could punch as hard as anyone of his weight – it was his stamina. He could fight for hours, and would wear opponents down by outlasting them.&quot; Jones also stated that Owen&#x27;s stamina made him an ideal fighter in the professional ranks where fights often went over ten rounds compared to his amateur career, where fights typically lasted three. His reliance on his ability to outlast fighters sometimes led to weak points during the early rounds of fights. Srikumar Sen of &quot;The Times&quot; noted &quot;Owen is a slow starter and can be caught early&quot;.

Although he did not possess devastating knockout power, Owen was noted for his &quot;fast accurate punching&quot;. Owen&#x27;s punching power was often debated, with some doubting that he possessed the power required to become a world champion. Michael Katz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote after his victory over John Feeney that &quot;the guy (Owen) can&#x27;t punch. If he could he would be illegal because he&#x27;s got so much else.&quot;
Owen was also praised for his sportsmanship towards other fighters. Idris Sutton, who trained Owen from an early age, described him as &quot;a real gentleman. I never saw him throw a foul punch or do anything dirty... If he saw his opponent slipping, he would stand back and give him a chance to get up. He... would never look to take advantage of an accident. And if you beat him fair and square he&#x27;d be the first to shake your hand.&quot; Lupe Pintor later described his admiration of Owen, remarking that he &quot;was very honorable because he had determination, not only the determination of winning but representing a society, his people, that&#x27;s the greatest thing I admired about him, his will, his hunger, that&#x27;s something that made him very special.&quot;

== Legacy ==

A year after his death, a pub in Merthyr named The Matchstick Man opened. The following year, a plaque was unveiled at Prince Charles Hospital after some of the money donated to charity by Owen&#x27;s family had been given to the establishment. The Johnny Owen Courage Award and the Johnny Owen Carer&#x27;s Award are presented annually at the hospital. A community centre, named the Johnny Owen Centre, was built on the Gurnos Estate in Merthyr shortly following his death in 1980. The building was demolished in 2018 after the owner, Merthyr Valley Homes, deemed it to be too costly to modernise. In 2002, a statue of Owen was erected in his hometown Merthyr at a cost of £40,000. His family attended the ceremony during which the statue was unveiled by Pintor, who travelled from his home country to attend. The same year, Dick Owens travelled to Mexico to meet with Pintor as part of the BBC Four documentary &quot;Johnny Owen: The Long Journey&quot; in which the two men met for the first time since 1980. The documentary won two BAFTA awards for best documentary drama and best direction in the Welsh production category.

Historian Martin Johnes has argued that Owen was an &quot;emblematic figure who represented both the ideals of Welsh working-class communities and their suffering and courage in the face of adversity and tragedy&quot;. Johnes&#x27; research demonstrates how Owen&#x27;s story was told and retold, with its meaning and relevance shifting in the postindustrial environment of Merthyr and South Wales. He noted that Owen&#x27;s funeral resembled those of the victims of coal mining pit disasters which had frequented the area while the &quot;Western Mail&quot; described him as &quot;the latest hero of a town scarred by bitter memories&quot;. In his published work on Owen, Johnes ends by stating that Owen &quot;remains a heroic figure&quot; in the South Wales Valleys.

== Marketing ==
The most prominent marketing strategy that Lotte Confectionery Corporation implements is held annually on November 11. The marketing strategy company takes improves every year. Due to the COVID-19, sales have been difficult. Hence, the company made an adjustment in marketing by live broadcast and delivery. Lotte Confectionery Corporation launched an exotic ice cream ‘Pepero-bar’ in limited time. Ice cream ‘Pepero-bar’ has used the originality feature of Pepero by covering with almond and displaying “Pepero friends” character as packaging to attract consumers.

== Sales ==
About 60% of the annual Pepero sales occur around Pepero Day, which is held on November 11. Pepero sales have reached a record high of about 1.1 trillion won in terms of supply prices until 2016. Pepero has successfully settled in the market by advertising Pepero Day. On average, Pepero&#x27;s daily sales on Pepero Day are about 84 times higher than usual. Lotte Confectionery Corporation actively participates in social contribution with its profits on Pepero since the sales increase every year. The major export regions such as Singapore, China, Russia, and the United States play a big stake in Pepero&#x27;s sales.

== Awards ==

* Watsons Best Selling Snack Award- 2012
* Watsons Best Selling Biscuit Award- 2014
* Watsons Best Selling Korean Biscuit Award- 2015
* Germany&#x27;s Red Dot Design Award- 2019
* Germany&#x27;s iF Design Award- 2020

== Social Contribution ==
The company donates Pepero to needy neighbors and social organizations. With its record sales and profits, Lotte contributes to establish the local children’s center.

== Criticism ==
Pepero has been criticized for copying Pocky, which has been manufactured by Japan&#x27;s Ezaki Glico Company since 1966. Lotte denies that it was inspired by the product. The Pocky product was introduced over 17 years before in the market. Ezaki Glico’s Pocky and Lotte Confectionery’s Pepero have a long history and known as rival companies in chocolate-covered stick (pretzel). Since the content of Pocky and Pepero is the same, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between the two products. Ezaki Glico filed a lawsuit against Lotte Confectionery about the trademark, and the shape of the originality of Pocky since Pocky has entered the United States market before Lotte Confectionery’s Pepero. Lotte Confectionery could design partially chocolate-based snacks in a different shape from Pocky. However, the court saw that only this factor could not offset the functionality of Pocky&#x27;s design. Lotte Confectionery Corporation won the case because the judge concluded that Pocky’s product appearance cannot be protected by trade dress due to its functionality.

In 2014, Glico sued Lotte which allegedly copied packaging box design of Glico&#x27;s Baton d&#x27;or exclusive series of Pocky and Pretz for Lotte&#x27;s new product Premier Pepero. On 14 August 2015, Seoul district court ruled that Lotte stole the box design of Glico&#x27;s products and the ruling is expected to force Lotte to halt its sales of the product and dispose of the existing stock.

On July 10, 2015, Glico filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court against Lotte USA for infringing on the trademarks of Pocky. Glico had registered the Pocky&#x27;s three-dimensional trademarks prior to the launch of Pepero in the U.S.

== Pepero Day ==
The date is set to November 11, annually. Farmer’s Day is also held in November 11 and referred it as a Garae Tteok Day. Pepero Day was derived from a middle school girl student in Yeongnam district of South Korea. They exchanged Pepero by saying “Let’s be tall and skinny” with well-wishing remarks. Nowadays, couples make Pepero or purchase it from the market in exchange with their gratitude to convey affection. As Pepero day comes to date, the sales of manufacturing companies drastically increase.

<doc id="985221" wikidata="Q573331" url="?curid=985221" title="German–Soviet Credit Agreement (1939)">
<text>The German–Soviet Credit Agreement (also referred to as the German–Soviet Trade and Credit Agreement) was an economic arrangement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union whereby the latter received an acceptance credit of over seven years with an effective interest rate of 4.5 percent. The credit line was to be used during the next two years for purchase of capital goods (factory equipment, installations, machinery and machine tools, ships, vehicles, and other means of transport) in Germany and was to be paid off by means of Soviet material shipment from 1946 onwards. The economic agreement was the first step toward improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Germany.

On 11 May 1939, the day after the Credit Agreement, the Soviet Union went to war against Japan in a successful four-week military campaign in the Far East. The Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed four days after the Credit Agreement. The 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement renewed declined German–Soviet economic relations and was adjusted and expanded with the larger German–Soviet Commercial Agreement in February 1940 and January 1941 German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement. German shipments to the Soviets became tardy and failed to provide all that was promised the closer the date of Barbarossa came. The Soviets fulfilled their obligations to the letter right up until the invasion, wanting to avoid provoking Germany. All these agreements were terminated when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, in violation of the treaties between the two countries. Soviet trade with Germany in the pre-invasion period ended up providing the Germans with many of the resources they needed for their invasion of the Soviet Union.

==Background==
===Traditional commerce and pre-Nazi trade===
Germany lacks natural resources, including several key raw materials needed for economic and military operations. Since the late 19th century, it had relied heavily upon Russian imports of such materials. Before World War I, Germany imported 1.5 billion Reichsmarks of raw materials and other goods per year from Russia. Such imports fell sharply after World War I. In the early 1930s, Soviet imports decreased as the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserted power and dwindling adherence to the disarmament requirements of the Treaty of Versailles decreased Germany&#x27;s reliance on Soviet imports.

===Deteriorating relations===
The rise to power of the Nazi Party increased tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union, with Nazi racial ideology casting the Soviet Union as populated by &quot;untermenschen&quot; ethnic Slavs ruled by their &quot;Jewish Bolshevik&quot; masters. Even with rising tensions, in the mid-1930s, the Soviet Union made repeated efforts to reestablish closer contacts with Germany., which were rebuffed by Hitler, who wished to steer clear of such political ties.

Relations further declined in 1936, when Germany supported the Fascist Spanish Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, while the Soviets supported the partially socialist-led Spanish Republic opposition. The same year, Germany and Japan entered the Anti-Comintern Pact. Stalinist purges also disrupted Soviet diplomacy.

===Late 1930s economic needs===
By the late 1930s, because an autarkic economic approach or an alliance with Britain were impossible, Germany needed to arrange closer relations with the Soviet Union, if not just for economic reasons alone. Germany lacked key supplies, such as oil and food, metal ores and rubber, for which it relied upon Soviet supply or transit, and had to look to Russia and Romania. Moreover, Germany&#x27;s food requirements would grow further if it conquered nations that were also net food importers. Soviet imports of Ukrainian grains or Soviet transshipments of Manchurian soybeans could make up the shortfall. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union required, in the short term, military equipment and weapon designs to strengthen the weakened Red Army and Red Navy. The Soviet transportation network was woefully underdeveloped, with roads approaching non-existence and rail lines already stretched to their limits.

After the Anschluss in mid-1938, economic reconciliation was hampered by political tension and Hitler&#x27;s increasing hesitance to deal with the Soviet Union. However, German needs for military supplies and Soviet needs for military machinery increased after the Munich Agreement.

==Negotiations==
=== Preliminary discussions ===
In October 1938, Germany started pushing for expansion of economic ties between the two countries and presented a plan to the Soviets on December 1, 1938. Stalin, however, was not willing to sell his increasingly strong economic bargaining position for the small price that Hitler was then willing to offer. The Soviets were willing to engage in talks discussing a new German offer in February and March 1939 in Moscow. Germany put the talks on hold in mid-March. A few days thereafter, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and then the Klaipėda Region (Memel), making a German war with Poland far more likely.

Germany and the Soviet Union discussed entering into an economic deal throughout early 1939. During spring and summer 1939, the Soviets negotiated a political and military pact with France and Britain, while at the same time talking with German officials about a potential political Soviet–German agreement. On April 7, Soviet diplomat Georgii Astakhov stated to the German Foreign Ministry that there was no point in continuing the German–Soviet ideological struggle and that the two countries could come to an agreement. Ten days later, Soviet ambassador Alexei Merekalov met with German State Secretary Ernst Weizsacker and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion the ambassador stated &quot;there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live with us on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better.&quot; Other sources claim that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador&#x27;s words. Immediately after the meeting, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany.

Likelihood of war increased military production in both Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviets&#x27; Third Five Year Plan would require massive new infusions of technology and industrial equipment. Meanwhile, German military spending increased to 23% of gross national product in 1939. German planners in April and May 1939 feared that a cessation of Swedish trade would cut key iron ore supplies. Without Soviet supplies, it was estimated that Germany would need to find substitutes for approximately 165,000 tons of manganese and almost 2 million tons of oil per year. Germany already faced severe rubber shortages because of British and Dutch refusals to trade. In addition to domestic food fat and oil importation reliance, other food problems arose from labor shortages in the agricultural sector that required the work of schoolchildren and students. On May 8, German officials estimated that Germany had oil reserves for only 3.1 months.

In the context of further economic discussions, on May 17, Astakhov told a German official that he wanted to restate &quot;in detail that there were no conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore there was no reason for any enmity between the two countries.&quot; Three days later, on May 20, Molotov told the German ambassador in Moscow that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a &quot;political basis&quot;, which German officials saw an &quot;implicit invitation&quot; and a &quot;virtual summoning us to a political dialogue.&quot; On May 26, German officials feared a potential positive result to come from the Soviets talks regarding proposals by Britain and France. On May 30, Germany directed its diplomats in Moscow that &quot;we have now decided to undertake definite negotiations with the Soviet Union.&quot; The ensuing discussions were channeled through the economic negotiation, because the economic needs of the two sides were substantial and because close military and diplomatic connections had been severed in the mid-1930s after the creation of the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Spanish Civil War, leaving these talks as the only means of communication.

===Mixed signals===

The Soviets sent mixed signals thereafter. On May 31, Molotov&#x27;s speech appeared to be positive, while on June 2 Soviet Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan told a German official that Moscow &quot;had lost all interest in these [economic] negotiations as a result of earlier German procrastination.&quot; On June 15, the Soviet ambassador held a discussion with the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, Purvan Draganov, who served as an unofficial intermediary for negotiations with the Germans. The Soviet ambassador explained that a deal with Germany better suited Soviet needs than a deal with Britain and France or inconclusive negotiations resulting in no deal. Draganov promptly informed the German Foreign Ministry of the conversation. Seven days earlier, the Soviets had agreed that a high ranking German official would come to Moscow to continue the negotiations, which occurred in Moscow on July 3. Thereafter, official talks were started in Berlin on July 22.

Meanwhile, hoping to stop the German war machine, in July, Britain conducted talks with Germany regarding a potential plan to bail out the debt-ridden German economy at the cost of one billion pounds in exchange for Germany ending its armaments program. The British press broke the story and Germany eventually rejected the offer.

===Addressing past hostilities and finalizing the deals===
On July 25, the Soviet Union and Germany were very close to finalizing the terms of a proposed economic deal. On July 26, over dinner, the Soviets accepted a proposed three-stage agenda which included the economic agenda first and &quot;a new arrangement which took account of the vital political interests of both parties.&quot; On August 1, the Soviets raised two conditions before political negotiations could begin: a new economic treaty and the cessation of anti-Soviet attacks by German media. The Germans immediately agreed. Two days later, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop outlined a plan where the countries would agree to nonintervention in the others&#x27; affairs and would renounce measures aimed at the others&#x27; vital interests and that &quot;there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us.&quot;

The Germans discussed prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. They addressed their common ground of anti-capitalism, stating &quot;there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies,&quot; &quot;neither we nor Italy have anything in common with the capitalist west&quot; and &quot;it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand on the side of the western democracies.&quot; The Germans explained that their prior hostility toward Soviet Bolshevism had subsided with the changes in the Comintern and the Soviet renunciation of a world revolution. Astakhov characterized the conversation as &quot;extremely important.&quot;

As Germany scheduled its invasion of Poland for August 25 and prepared for war with France, German war planners in August estimated that, with an expected British naval blockade and the hostile Soviet Union, Germany would fall short of its war mobilization requirements by 9.9 million tons of oil and 260,000 tons of manganese. At that time, Germany was still importing 20% of foodstuffs, 66% of oil and 80% of rubber. It possessed only two to three months of rubber and three to six months of oil supplies. Because of the expected naval blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only supplier for many items.

On August 5, Soviet officials stated that the completion of the trading credit agreement was crucial for further political talks. Hitler himself telephoned to interrupt economic talks, pushing for a settlement. By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details, but the Soviets delayed signing the economic agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had also reached a political agreement. The Soviet ambassador explained that the Soviets had begun their British negotiations &quot;without much enthusiasm&quot; at a time when they felt Germany would not &quot;come to an understanding,&quot; and the parallel talks with the British could not be simply broken off when they had been initiated after &quot;mature consideration.&quot; Meanwhile, every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. The Wehrmacht High Command issued a report that Germany could only be safe from a blockade on the basis of close economic cooperation with the Soviet Union.

==German–Soviet deal==

===Economic deal===
While the treaty was ready at 4 pm on August 19, the Soviets announced that they could not sign it that day, worrying German officials that the Soviets were delaying for political reasons. When TASS published a report that the Soviet–British–French talks had become snarled over the Far East and &quot;entirely different matters&quot;, Germany took it as a signal that there was still time and hope to reach a Soviet–German deal. At 2 am on August 20, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the trade agreement, dated August 19, in Berlin providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials.

The agreement covered &quot;current&quot; business, which entailed Soviet obligations to deliver 180 million Reichsmarks in raw materials and German commitment to provide the Soviets with 120 million Reichsmarks of German industrial goods. Under the agreement, Germany also granted the Soviet Union a merchandise credit of over seven years to be financed by the German Gold Discount Bank. The credit was to be used to finance Soviet &quot;new business&quot; orders in Germany to include machinery, manufactured goods, war materials and hard currency. This loan would be 100% guaranteed by the German government with a 5% interest rate. However, the agreement contained a &quot;Confidential Protocol&quot; providing that the German government would refund 0.5% of the interest, making the effective rate 4.5%. The terms were extremely favorable, at 1.5–2.5% lower as compared to discount rates than such credit lines in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Soviet Union would start to pay off the loan with raw materials seven years later (beginning in 1946).

===Political deal and secret protocol===
German Foreign Ministry official Karl Schnurre noted at the time that &quot;[t]he movement of goods envisaged by the agreement might therefore reach a total of more than 1 billion Reichsmarks for the next few years.&quot; Schnurre also wrote &quot;[a]part from the economic import of the treaty, its significance lies in the fact that the negotiations also served to renew political contacts with Russia and that the credit agreement was considered by both sides as the first decisive step in the reshaping of political relations.&quot; &quot;Pravda&quot; published an
article on August 21 declaring that the August 19 commercial agreement &quot;may appear as a serious step in the cause of improving not only economic, but also political relations between the USSR and Germany.&quot; Molotov wrote in &quot;Pravda&quot; that the August 19 deal was &quot;better than all earlier treaties&quot; and &quot;we have never managed to reach such a favorable economic agreement with Britain, France or any other country.&quot;

Early in the morning of August 24, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the political and military deal that accompanied the trade agreement, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The pact was an agreement of mutual non-aggression between the countries. It contained secret protocols dividing the states of Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet &quot;spheres of influence.&quot; At the time, Stalin considered the trade agreement to be more important than the non-aggression pact.

At the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanged toasts and further addressed the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. They characterized Britain as always attempting to disrupt Soviet-German relations, stated that the Anti-Comintern pact was not aimed at the Soviet Union, but actually aimed at Western democracies and &quot;frightened principally the City of London [i.e., the British financiers] and the English shopkeepers.&quot;

In 2010, Timothy Snyder linked the improvement in Nazi-Soviet relations in 1939 to Stalin&#x27;s objective of disrupting the Anti-Comintern Pact and waging war on Japan. Snyder said:
&quot;On 20 August 1939, Hitler sent a personal message to Stalin, asking him to receive Ribbentrop no later than the twenty-third. Ribbentrop made for Moscow, where, as both Orwell and Koestler noted, swastikas adorned the airport of the capital of the homeland of socialism. This, the final ideological shock that separated Koestler from communism, was really a sign that the Soviet Union was no longer an ideological state. The two regimes immediately found common ground in their mutual aspiration to destroy Poland ...the Soviet Union had agreed to attack Poland along with Germany. ... In August and September 1939, Stalin was reading maps not just of east Europe but of east Asia. He had found an opportunity to improve the Soviet position in the Far East. ...Stalin could now be confident that no German-Polish attack was coming from the west... The Soviets (and their Mongolian allies) attacked Japanese (and puppet Manchukuo) forces... on 20 August 1939. Stalin&#x27;s policy of rapprochement with Berlin of August 23, 1939, was also directed against Tokyo. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, signed three days after the offensive, nullified the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan. Even more than the battlefield defeat, the Nazi-Soviet alliance brought a political earthquake to Tokyo. The Japanese government fell, as would several more in the coming months. Once Germany seemed to have chosen the Soviet Union rather than Japan as its ally, the Japanese government found itself in an unexpected and confusing situation... if the union between Moscow and Berlin held, the Red Army would be able to concentrate its forces in Asia rather than in Europe. ... Hitler had given Stalin a free hand in Asia, and the Japanese could only hope that Hitler would betray his new friend. ... When the Red Army defeated the Japanese, on 15 September, Stalin had achieved exactly the result that he wanted. ... Stalin had replaced the phantom of a German-Polish-Japanese encirclement of the Soviet Union with a very real German-Soviet encirclement of Poland, an alliance that isolated Japan.&quot;
==Later events and total trade==
After the German invasion of Poland, to administer the economic blockade of Germany, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare was established on September 3, 1939. By April 1940 Britain realized that blockade appeared not to be working because of &quot;leaks&quot; in the blockade, with two major &quot;holes&quot; in the Black Sea and Mediterranean provided by several neutral countries, including Italy.

On September 17, the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory which held up to 70 per cent of Poland&#x27;s pre-war oil production.

In October three German trade partners - Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were given no choice but to sign a so-called &quot;Pact of defense and mutual assistance&quot; which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.

German-Soviet tensions were also raised by the Soviet invasion of Finland started at November 1939. Several German merchant ships were damaged

Germany and the Soviet Union continued economic, military and political negotiations throughout the last half of 1939, which resulted in a much larger German–Soviet Commercial Agreement was signed on February 11, 1940. Under that agreement, the Soviet Union became a major supplier of vital materials to Germany, including petroleum, manganese, copper, nickel, chrome, platinum, lumber and grain.
They also received considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, including manganese ore, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. On January 10, 1941, the countries signed an additional agreement modifying their 1940 commercial agreement, adjusting borders, and resolving other minor disputes.

During both the first period of the 1940 agreement (February 11, 1940, to February 11, 1941) and the second (February 11, 1941, until the Pact was broken), Germany received massive quantities of raw materials, including over:
* 1,600,000 tons of grains
* 900,000 tons of oil
* 200,000 tons of cotton
* 140,000 tons of manganese
* 200,000 tons of phosphates
* 20,000 tons of chrome ore
* 18,000 tons of rubber
* 100,000 tons of soybeans
* 500,000 tons of iron ores
* 300,000 tons of scrap metal and pig iron
* 2,000 kilograms of platinum

In August 1940, Soviet imports comprised over 50% of Germany&#x27;s total overseas imports, which declined at this time to 20.4 thousands of tons.

The trade relations ended when Germany began Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.

The various items that the USSR had sent to Germany from 1939 to 1941 in significant amount, could be substituted or obtained by increased imports from other countries. Conversely, without Soviet deliveries of these major items, Germany could barely have attacked the Soviet Union, let alone come close to victory, even with more intense rationing.

<text>Colwinston (historically sometimes Colwinstone; ) is both a village and a community in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, approximately southeast of the centre of Bridgend and west of the centre of Cardiff. The village is located within of the A48. The population in 2005 was approximately 400 but with recent building development, the population is now estimated at over 600 people.

The novelist Agatha Christie was a frequent visitor, and her descendants still live at the former manor house of Pwllywrach.

==History==
===Archaeological and early historical evidence===
Bronze Age axe heads discovered on land at Highfield Farm and Iron Age kilns suggest that the area was settled during prehistoric times. The impetus for the development of an agrarian village may have been the local geography: a gentle valley going east to west towards the village, providing a water supply and creating a natural bowl, with a present-day exit leading down Church Lane.

Steep slopes in the central part of the village make it unlike other Vale of Glamorgan villages in its topography. The watercourse is now underground but rises to the surface in prolonged wet weather. The older village houses are situated on the higher ground overlooking meadows, possibly built on the sites of older simple dwellings. It is thought the area between Garden and Penlan Cottages and Church Cottage provided protection and water for livestock. Title Deeds and old census records call this area &quot;The Square&quot;. A village well is present near Ty Draw Farm, and it is likely that watercress was harvested from the open water course there.

There is evidence of Roman activity in the Vale of Glamorgan, and their link to West Wales was along what would become the route of the A48. Llantwit Major Roman Villa, for example, is thought to have been built on a site occupied since the British Iron Age. (There was another excavation in 1971.) Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the area was ruled by the medieval &quot;princes&quot; of Morgannwg; their kingdom included the area later known as Glamorgan. During this period the settlement came to be called &quot;Colwinstūn&quot;, possibly from an old English name &quot;Colwine&quot; linked with &quot;tūn&quot;, meaning farm or settlement.
===Norman rule and new land ownership===
Caradog ap Gruffudd and Iestyn ap Gwrgant from the north and west usurped the princes in about 1070, and Robert Fitzhamon led the Norman invasion of the area from Bristol, probably by sea. Local folklore says that the nickname of &quot;Golden Mile&quot; (the area shown on old maps as being between Twmpath Farm and the main village, or the northern edge of the village&#x27;s original common) arises either from Fitzhamon&#x27;s forces lining up to receive their payment along a section of the A48 adjacent to Colwinston, or from Civil War troops gathering in the same location for payment; another theory is that the name originated because of yellow gorse plants growing along the old road at this point.

William de Londres was granted the lordship of Ogmore (which included Colwinston) by Fitzhamon, and also established Ewenny Priory in 1141 under the Benedictine Abbey in Gloucester. He gave &#x27;the Church of St Michael of Ewenny, the Church of St Bridget with the Chapel of Ugemore de Lanfey, the Church of St. Michael of Colvestone with the lands, meadows and all other things belonging unto them’ to the Abbey. The grant of a 66-acre farm (possibly Ty Maen Farm) was later added to this. There is evidence that St Michael and All Angels Church, Colwinston, was founded in 1111, predating the Priory by 30 years.

===Middle Ages and after===
By 1340, Sir Roger de Bavant had become the owner of the remainder of the Manor. In 1344 (for reasons unknown) he gave his property to the then King of England, Edward III, who (again for reasons unknown) endowed the property upon the Dominican Nuns at Dartford Priory in Kent. Tithes and rents were paid to the two Priories, with the right to appoint the Vicar being with Ewenny Priory. Henry VIII famously seized all monastery lands in 1536, Sir Edward Carne, a commissioner during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was able to lease Ewenny Priory from the king, eventually purchasing it in 1545 for £727-6s-4d. He also purchased the Dartford priory land at Colwinston creating a single &#x27;Manor of Colwinston&#x27;. By 1539 English law had been extended to cover Wales and the County of Glamorgan was formally established as an administrative unit. Colwinston remained a pocket of recusancy, with priests continuing to administer the sacrament according to the Roman rite. Even into the 17th century, John Lloyd, a local priest under the protection of the Turbevilles at Penlline, was arrested and hanged, drawn and quartered on the Heath at Cardiff in 1679 at the height of the hysteria caused by the &#x27;Popish Plot&#x27;.

===16th to 19th century===
The Norman tradition of primogeniture had taken over in Glamorgan, in contrast with traditional Welsh law. In the 1670s, With no sons to inherit, the Carne family lands were divided between two surviving Carne daughters upon their marriages. Colwinston thus became the property of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet, of Margam when he married Martha Carne.

In 1747 Bussy Mansel, 4th Baron Mansel, succeeded to the title. Having no male heirs, he sold the ‘Manor of Colwinston’ to David Thomas ‘of Bath’. Thomas had married into the family that owned Pwllywrach, where he built a new ‘Manor house’. Four generations later the Manor was again without a male heir after the death of Hubert be Burgh Thomas. His sister, Mary Anna Thomas, married Charles John Prichard some time after 1878, placing the land at Colwinston in trust for their son, Hubert Cecil Prichard.

Small farms were often then sold on to other farmers and landowners in this period. The Golden Mile Common, an area of approximately 70 acres lying alongside the A48, was ‘enclosed’ by an Act of Parliament called the ‘Golden Mile Award’ in 1871. The village population in the 19th century thus became formed around the Pwllywrach House and Hilton Farm, a number of small farm units stretching west–east from Ty Maen to the Yew Tree and Chapel Farms, north to Claypit and Highfield Farms and south to Stembridge and Parcau Farms, some labourers’ cottages owned by the Pwllywrach estate and others, the Church and the Parsonage (and the then Vicarage) and three chapels. Some of the land on the northern side of village was owned by Jesus College, Oxford. Agriculture was supported by other trades including the Sycamore Tree Inn (recorded back to at least 1840, the building is post-medieval), a forge and blacksmith, baker, shoemaker, post office and horse breaker.

However, there was a substantial turnover in the village population following the start of the Industrial Revolution. Census records show that of the 268 people living in the village in 1861, only 98 had been living in the village in 1851; 168 people who died or moved away during that decade were replaced by a high number of births and people moving in from West Wales and Ireland.

The 1861 census also reveals the existence of a private school within the village. A &quot;National&quot; school, supported by the (then) Church of England, was established in 1871, in the building now known as Ty Colwyn, with 27 children on the original register. From 1875 the school was funded through a voluntary Parish rate. The present village school (Church in Wales) was built in 1970.

In addition to the Anglican church, several Nonconformist chapels existed in the village, and were popular with Welsh-language speakers. Seion Calvinistic Methodist (Presbyterian) Chapel was built in 1830, surviving until 1996. Ebenezer Baptist Chapel was founded in 1843 and a building established in 1852, using part of Chapel Farm House. It continued in use until 1944, and a baptismal pool was created by blocking off a stream in the field below and to the rear of the chapel.

In 1865, a village branch of the Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites was established, based at the Sycamore Tree Inn, conducting its business in Welsh. This provided a vehicle for villagers with independent incomes to save, and then possibly to buy, their own properties. It finally closed in 1960, and the order as a whole disbanded in the early 1970s.

The 1811 &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales&quot; by Nicholas Carlisle said of the village:
===20th century===
The population of the village began to grow away from its agricultural origins, with some emigration to the South Wales coalfields by those seeking industrial employment, whilst the need for intensive labour on farms was reduced by machinery and the village population declined. Some of the original houses fell into disrepair as these population movements took place.

Colonel Hubert Cecil Prichard came to live at Pwllywrach after the First World War. His son Hubert de Burgh Prichard famously married Rosalind Hicks, the only daughter of Agatha Christie, their son Mathew Prichard being given the proceeds from the royalties of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. He subsequently used the substantial sums from the play to establish the Colwinston Charitable Trust in 1995.

Gradually ‘modern’ features eventually found their way to the village, including mains water in 1935, and electricity and telephone (in the form of a public kiosk) from 1946 onwards. A new water main was laid from the A48 in 1972 and a new sewage scheme laid in 1973. Beech Park was built in the 1960s with other small developments following. The smaller, mostly tenanted, farms became unviable in the latter part of the 20th century. The remaining farm buildings between Church Farm and Colwinston House (built originally as a Dower House for Pwllywrach) were gradually sold as residential houses, with the barns and brickyards between the farmhouses also being sold off for development. The Pwllyrwrach estate created a single large farm based at Pwllyrwrach Farm, concentrating on sheep and beef cattle farming (rather than the dairy farming which had previously been predominant.)

===21st century===
The agricultural land in and around the village is now variously owned by the Pwllywrach Estate, a number of independent landowners (especially to the north and west of the village) as well as a small number of independent farmers who have bought and/or inherited land over the centuries. Other properties are owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council for the school, the Village Hall and the remaining social housing. Finally, most private housing is now owned by individual house owners, either as new-build properties or older houses mostly purchased from the Pwllywrach estate, the local authority, the chapel organisations and the Church in Wales or local farmers.

The main fabric of the village was thus set until 2016 when the developer Redrow plc built 64 new homes on land now known as Heol Cae Pwll (completed in 2018), increasing the population to over 600. Protests against the extent of the development by local residents were overruled by the Vale of Glamorgan Council. Community representatives pointed to regular flooding and said that &quot;adding 64 homes to a village with 130 at the moment can only increase that risk&quot;. Along with this came &quot;fibre&quot; broadband. The village has gained a local and national reputation in recent years for its community spirit and activities.

==Village on maps and its name==
A 16th-century map (probably of lands inherited by the Duchy of Lancaster) shows the village as Colwyns&#x27; Tone. The name was sometimes shortened to Coulston (e.g. Christopher Saxton&#x27;s map of 1578). The village name was later usually spelled as one word, most commonly as Colwinstone or Colwinston. The Ordnance Survey has used ‘Colwinston’ since 1833 (reflecting the usual pronunciation) but some official sources (e.g. census records, official postal addresses) included an -e until the latter part of the 20th century.

The Welsh name of the village, Tregolwyn, first appears in writing c. 1566 as &quot;tref golwyn&quot;; it was not often recorded in official documents because of restrictions on the use of Welsh, but appears to be derived from &quot;tun&quot; as &quot;tref&quot; (&quot;town&quot;), and the Welsh name &quot;Colwyn&quot; or &quot;Collwyn&quot;, which also has a literal meaning of &quot;cub, whelp, puppy&quot;.

==Demographics==
Colwinston&#x27;s population was 447, according to the 2011 census; a 10.1% increase since the 406 people noted in 2001. This has recently been increased through the addition of 64 family homes. The 2011 census showed 13.1% of the population could speak Welsh, a rise from 7.8% in 2001.

==Church of St Michael &amp; All Angels==
The original Norman St Michael&#x27;s Church in Colwinston is reputed to have been built in 1111. The church was restored in 1879 and again in the 1970s and 2000s.

The medieval parish church is a Grade 1 listed building. The church underwent a substantial restoration in 1879, and again in 1971 following a fire which badly damaged the chancel, destroying the brass tablets either side of the altar displaying the Ten Commandments. It was at this time that the words “Holy, Holy, Holy” painted in scroll work above the chancel arch were painted over.

Further restoration work at the church was carried out at the millennium with the benefit of a major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund together with grants from other bodies and funds raised by the villagers. A vestry, kitchen and toilet were built on the north side of the church, the interior and exterior walls were lime washed and the roof repaired at a cost of £350,000.

==Other landmarks==
Of the ten Grade II listed buildings in the village, all date from the medieval or immediate post-medieval period. These include a thatched house, &quot;The Old Parsonage&quot;, the former manor house of Pwllywrach, and several former farmhouses. The Old Parsonage, a thatched house dating to the 16th century at the crossroads and opposite the southeast corner of churchyard, has a Gothic or Tudor arch and the building is &quot;one of only two in Glamorgan with a latrine in the form of a small closet at the side of the fireplace.&quot;

In 1835, the Seion Presbyterian Chapel was built but it closed in 1996; it later became a residential building. In 1843, the Ebenezer Baptist Chapel was established and the building was completed in 1852. The last minister was the Rev A.E. Powell of Balarat, who served at the church between 1905 and 1944 before the church became part of a house.

The Sycamore Tree Inn, a public house run by Brains Brewery, can be dated to 1650 or earlier. In May 1865, The Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites Friendly Society was established and registered there.

Community resources in the village include St David&#x27;s Church in Wales Primary School, the village hall and the village Playing Field.

==A Thankful Village==
Colwinston is one of only three villages in Wales which suffered no fatalities in World War I, despite 23 residents of the village having been on active service. It is one of only 53 Thankful Villages in the UK. However, the village lost four men in World War II, one of whom was Agatha Christie&#x27;s son-in-law, Colonel Hubert Prichard. Welcome signs at the entrance to the village reflected its status as a thankful village from but the village had no war memorial until 2014, when one was erected on the village green.

==Governance==
Colwinston has its own community council with seven elected or co-opted members. For elections to the Vale of Glamorgan Council, Colwinston is part of the Llandow/Ewenny county electoral ward.

==Culture==
The major social event of the year is the annual village fete, usually held during the first or second week in July. Other annual events include a pantomime and the New Year&#x27;s Day sport of &quot;collyball&quot;. A multi-use games area (MUGA) was constructed close to the village hall in 2013.

The village published its own local source book, &quot;Colwinston - A Changing Village&quot;, simultaneously with the publication of a fully researched history of the village, &quot;Colwinston: A Historical Journey&quot;, by Cowbridge History Society.

<doc id="985229" wikidata="Q1570041" url="?curid=985229" title="List of world best times in rowing">
<text>There are no world records in rowing due to the huge variability that weather conditions can have on times. Instead, there are world best times, which are set over the international rowing distance of 2,000m. 

==On-water records==
Rowing times are strongly affected by weather conditions, and to a lesser extent by water temperature – the majority of these times were set in warm water with a strong tailwind. World best rowing times have also decreased because of improvements in technology to both the boats and the oars, along with improvements in the conditioning of the rowers.

Because environmental conditions have a strong impact on boat speed, World Rowing recognizes world best times instead of world records. A world best time is one recorded on a regatta course that has previously held the World Championships, Olympic Games, or World Cup since 1980. A number of record times were set at the 2005 World Rowing Championships held on the Nagara River at Kaizu, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, but due to a fast current caused by heavy rainfall from the remnants of Typhoon Mawar, World Rowing declared that the race results were not eligible to be considered as world best times.

There is a category for lightweight rowing. For men, the crew average, wearing racing kit, cannot exceed and no rower may be over . For women, the limits are and .

Hamish Bond and Eric Murray hold the record for most consecutive wins with 69.

===Men===

The greatest distance rowed in 24 hours is 342 km (212.5 miles) by Hannes Obreno, Pierre de Loof, Tim Brys, Mathieu Foucaud, Thijs Obreno, Giel Vanschoenbeek, Arjan van Belle and Thibaut Schollaert (all Belgians) on the Watersportbaan in Ghent, Belgium, on 2–3 October 2014. All eight participants were members of a student rowing club called VSR (&quot;Vlaamse Studentenvereniging der Roeiers&quot; [translates to Flanders Student Rowing Club]).

The greatest distance rowed in 1 hour is 17,555 m (10.91 miles) by the Delftse Studenten Roeiverening Proteus-Eretes during the Hour boat race on 17 December 2017.

==Indoor records==
These results are based on a standard distance of 2,000 meters.&lt;br&gt;

<text>The Haifa Street helicopter incident or the Haifa Street massacre was a controversial event in Baghdad, Iraq, on September 12, 2004. The fighting started before dawn on Haifa Street, where insurgents detonated two car bombs and attacked American troops with heavy gunfire. An American Bradley armored fighting vehicle was mobilized to support US troops, but it was struck by a car bomb around 6:30 a.m., wounding four American soldiers.

After the wounded Americans were evacuated, witnesses reported that a crowd had gathered around the burning Bradley, apparently celebrating. Media personnel also arrived on the scene, filming the burning wreckage. Reports said that the media and crowd had been gathered around the vehicle after the fighting ended. At around 8:00 a.m., an American helicopter fired two missiles and machine guns at the burning tank, killing 13 people and injuring about 60 others.

Among the dead was Mazen al-Tumeizi, a Palestinian reporter for al-Arabiya TV who was filming a report at the time. Tumeizi&#x27;s death and the incident itself were caught by his cameraman.

The American military said it fired on the vehicle &quot;to prevent looting and harm to the Iraqi people,&quot; and that they had fired on insurgents, not civilians.

<doc id="985251" wikidata="Q2120057" url="?curid=985251" title="Snaresbrook tube station">
<text>Snaresbrook is a London Underground station in the area of Snaresbrook in east London. It is on the Central line between Leytonstone and South Woodford stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
The station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway on 22 August 1856 as part of their branch to Loughton which opened that day. Originally named &quot;Snaresbrook&quot;, the station was renamed several times: &quot;Snaresbrook for Wanstead&quot; in 1857; &quot;Snaresbrook and Wanstead&quot; in November 1898; &quot;Snaresbrook for Wanstead&quot; in 1929; and &quot;Snaresbrook&quot; on 14 December 1947. The station formed part of the Great Eastern Railway&#x27;s system until that company amalgamated with other railways to create the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. The station was subsequently transferred to form part of London Underground&#x27;s Central line from 14 December 1947. This formed a part of the long planned, and delayed, Eastern Extension of the Central line that was part of the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s &quot;New Works Programme&quot; of 1935–1940.

The station was partially reconstructed in 1893, the most notable feature being the provision of a bay platform that remained in use until transfer to the Underground.

The station is a fine survivor of a Victorian suburban station, with later additions, and includes a brick built station building as well as extensive cast iron and timber canopies to the platforms. A small secondary ticket office, serving the westbound platforms, was constructed in c.1948 but this is now unused. Also of note, dating from the same date, are the examples of the concrete roundels (some combined with lamp posts) found on the platforms.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step-free access by 2023–24, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

==The station today==
In addition to the main building, an alternative exit open at morning peak hours is available directly on the south side of Wanstead High Street, with another open all day on the north side of the same road accessible via footbridge running parallel to the railway.

==Connections==
London Buses route W14 serves the station.

<doc id="985252" wikidata="Q1529863" url="?curid=985252" title="Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 751">
<text>Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 751 was a regularly scheduled Scandinavian Airlines passenger flight from Stockholm, Sweden, to Warsaw, Poland, via Copenhagen, Denmark. On 27 December 1991, a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 operating the flight, registration OY-KHO, piloted by Danish Captain Stefan G. Rasmussen (44) and Swedish first officer Ulf Cedermark (34), both experienced pilots with 8,000 and 3,000 flight hours, respectively, was forced to make an emergency landing in a field near Gottröra, Sweden. Ice had collected on the wings&#x27; inner roots (close to the fuselage) before takeoff, broke off, and was ingested into the engines as the aircraft became airborne on takeoff, ultimately disabling both engines. All 129 passengers and crew aboard survived.

The incident is known as the Gottröra crash () or the Miracle at Gottröra () in Sweden.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas MD-81, MSN 53003, registered as OY-KHO, that was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas in 1991. It had logged approximately 1608 airframe hours and 1272 takeoff and landing cycles and was equipped with two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-217C engines.

==Accident==
The aircraft had arrived at Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 22:09 local time after a flight from Zürich the previous evening and was parked overnight at temperatures of around . About of very cold, flight-chilled fuel remained in the wing tanks. Due to this, clear ice had formed on the upper side of the wings, but was not detected. The aircraft was de-iced with of de-icing fluid, but not checked afterwards for remaining ice by the de-icing personnel or the Pilot-in-Charge, Captain Rasmussen, which he was required to do by the Scandinavian Airlines &quot;Flight Deck Bulletin/Winterization&quot; given to pilots.

The plane departed from Stockholm at 08:47. Shortly after liftoff, pieces of ice broke off and slammed into the fans of both engines, deforming the fan blades sufficiently to disturb the airflow to the compressors. The disturbed airflow caused the compressors to stall and this in turn caused the engines to surge. As the engines were not throttled down sufficiently, the surges continued. The high loads from repeated engine surges quickly led to the breakup of both engines.

From the pilots&#x27; point of view, after 25 seconds of flight, noises and vibrations caused by the no. 2 engine surging were first noticed. The flight crew responded by throttling down a little, but an automatic system, ATR (automatic thrust restoration), that had not been described to the flight crew by SAS, simultaneously increased throttle as a response to the asymmetric engine power and reduced climb rate. As a consequence, the engine surges continued. SAS Flight Captain Per Holmberg, who was on board as a passenger, noticed the problems early, hurried to the cockpit, and provided invaluable assistance to the crew. Engine no. 1 surged 39 seconds later and both engines failed at 76 and 78 seconds, respectively, into flight, at an altitude of .

The pilot responded to the loss of both engines by pitching the aircraft down in a dive before leveling it, to try to have it glide the longest possible distance without stalling. The pilots requested a return to Arlanda and attempted the restart procedure, but, with the aircraft emerging from cloud cover at altitude, they chose a field in the forest, near the Vängsjöberg seat farm in Gottröra, Uppland, for an immediate emergency landing.

During the final descent, the aircraft hit several trees, losing a large part of the right wing. It struck the ground tail-first, and the tail cone of the plane broke off. The plane slid across the field for , during which the main landing gear of the plane dug marks into the field and sheared off, the nose landing gear broke off, and the fuselage broke into three parts. As a result of the accident, 25 people were injured—two of them seriously—but there were no fatalities. The flight attendants had instructed passengers to adopt the brace position, which is credited with the lack of fatalities.

The flight crew, and especially Captain Rasmussen, were lauded for the skilled emergency landing in a fast-developing, potentially fatal situation. Rasmussen commented that &quot;few civilian air pilots are ever put to a test of the skills they have acquired during training to this degree&quot;. He said he was proud of his crew and very relieved everyone had survived. He chose not to return to piloting commercial aircraft, after experiencing a lack of trust in the machinery he was piloting in simulator sessions following the accident. In 2022 he still suffered from PTSD from the aftermath of the accident when he was both called a hero and a villain despite him just believing he did the job he was trained for.

==Investigation and recommendations==

According to the official accident report by the Swedish Accident Investigation Board (SHK), the problem of clear ice formation on the wings in this type of aircraft was a well-known phenomenon at the time of the accident.
From 1985 onward, McDonnell Douglas gave extensive information, including several &quot;All Operators Letters&quot; that dealt with the clear ice problem. In the &quot;All Operators Letter&quot; of 14 October 1986, operators were informed of how the Finnish airline Finnair had solved the problem of discovering clear ice. In 1988 and 1989, McDonnell Douglas arranged &quot;Theme Conferences&quot; dealing with clear ice formation. SAS took part in these conferences.

On 26 October 1991, SAS distributed a &quot;Flight Deck Bulletin/Winterization&quot; to all pilots. It stated:
&quot;It is the Pilot-in-Charge&#x27;s responsibility to check the aircraft for any ice or snow that may affect performance&quot; and in the section &quot;Clear Ice&quot;, it noted &quot; [a]lthough the awareness within Line Maintenance is mostly good, the responsibility again rests with the Pilot-in-Charge that the aircraft is physically checked by means of a hands-on check on the upper side of the wing. A visual check from a ladder or when standing on the ground is &quot;not&quot; enough&quot;.

Another contribution to the accident was insufficient training of the crew; they were not trained in restoring engine operation after they repeatedly surged. There was no simulator or other training on the engine surging problem. Secondly, they were not informed about a pre-installed automatic thrust system (automatic thrust restoration or ATR). The reason for this lapse of information was that there was no knowledge of ATR within SAS. Nonetheless, ATR was described in manuals by the aircraft manufacturer, which every operator is obliged to know. Even though the system was developed for use in procedures not applied by SAS, a sufficiently careful study of the manuals should have led to SAS noting the system and training its pilots in its function.

The conclusion of the official accident report stated:

In the section &quot;Compressor Failures&quot;, the report stated:
The newly installed ATR prevented the pilots from successfully performing the normal remedial measure to halt compressor stall, &quot;i.e.&quot;, throttling back the engines, as the ATR system — designed to prevent pilots from using less than normal thrust when climbing out after take-off for noise abatement reasons — restored engine take-off power throttle settings, contrary to the pilots&#x27; reduced throttle commands. This damaged the engines, until eventually, they failed completely, removing any possibility of a crash-avoiding restart.

==In popular culture==
The story of the accident was featured on the tenth season of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday.&quot; The episode is titled &quot;Pilot Betrayed&quot;.

<doc id="985259" wikidata="Q16190232" url="?curid=985259" title="Parliamentary motion to impeach Tony Blair">
<text>In November 2004, a cross-party group of British members of parliament tabled a motion in the House of Commons to impeach the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, Tony Blair for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanours&quot;. The motion was never debated.

==Viability==

In the UK the most recent previous impeachment motion was made in 1848 (by Thomas Chisholm Anstey against the Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston, who was accused of concluding a secret treaty with Russia). The campaigners first needed to establish that impeachment was still viable in modern politics. On 17 November 2004 the speaker ruled their motion in order and it was tabled for the next session.

==Initial presentation==
In August 2004, Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price commissioned and published the report: &quot;A Case to Answer: a first report on the potential impeachment of the Prime Minister for High Crimes and Misdemeanours in relation to the invasion of Iraq&quot;. The document was written by Dr Glen Rangwala (lecturer of politics at University of Cambridge) and Dan Plesch (Honorary Fellow of Birkbeck, University of London.)

==Legal opinion==
The campaign hired solicitor Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers to represent their case. They have also asked Matrix Chambers to draw up a legal opinion. Matrix is known for its advocacy of human rights cases and for being the barristers&#x27; chambers of Blair&#x27;s wife and Queen&#x27;s Counsel, Cherie Booth. Booth was not involved in the case due to the obvious conflict of interest.

==Drafting team==
The drafting team for the motion was announced on 13 October 2004:
It appeared that the team would also draft the articles of impeachment. In earlier impeachment cases, this has usually been done after the motion, although it also occurred first in the case of Warren Hastings.

The drafting team completed the text of the impeachment motion on 7 November 2004.

==Impeachment motion==
The legal advisers to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, approved the wording of the motion on 17 November 2004. The motion was tabled for the first day of the next session (the day after the Queen&#x27;s Speech) on 24 November 2004. However, the main three parties forbade their MPs from signing the motion and it was never selected for debate.

If the motion had been selected, it would have allowed MPs to debate matters that parliamentary language otherwise forbids. For example, on 17 March 2005, the anniversary of going to war, Price accused Tony Blair of misleading the house. Because this breached the rules of parliamentary language, he was required to leave the House for the remainder of the day. However, such rules only apply to debate within the House. In press and radio and television interviews, other MPs have accused Blair of lying to the House and to the British people, including then opposition leader Michael Howard.

<text>Oscar Reutersvärd (29 November 1915 – 2 February 2002) was a Swedish graphic artist, who in 1934 pioneered the art of 3D drawings that may initially appear feasible, yet cannot be physically constructed. He is sometimes described as &quot;the father of the impossible figure&quot;, although there are much older examples, e.g. Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Satire on False Perspective&quot;.

==Biography==
Born on 29 November 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, he reportedly suffered from dyslexia and had difficulty estimating the distance and size of objects. But his family was artistic, and encouraged his painting and sculpture efforts at home.

==Work==
Reutersvärd&#x27;s originality appeared early in his career—at the age of 18. In 1934, the school student created a figure, the &quot;impossible triangle&quot;, composed of a series of cubes in perspective. &quot;the triangle at first seems like the simple geometrical shape with which all schoolchildren are familiar. However, as the eye tries to follow its outlines, the triangle abruptly becomes a dizzying experience as its bottom link plays havoc with the brain&#x27;s intuitive knowledge of physical laws.&quot; according to &quot;World of Mathematics&quot;, 2006, published by Thomson Gale. This very triangle was chosen in 1982 by the government of Sweden as the subject of a 25 öre postage stamp.
In 1937, he created his first impossible stairs, and the concept that would lead to the impossible fork. Subsequently, he focused on academics. In 1958, he read the now classic article by Lionel and Roger Penrose on impossible objects, which included the triangle and staircase that the British father and son team had developed independently. One artist inspired by the Penrose article was M.C. Escher—who produced two prints of impossible buildings in 1961 and 1962. The application of the concepts he originated over 20 years prior, by serious mathematicians and artists, rekindled Reutersvärd&#x27;s interest. By 1963, he had created several new and original impossible figures, and was featured by a gallery in Stockholm.

He would create his figures with India ink on Japanese rice paper, drawing freehand, without a ruler or any mechanical device. He generally used &quot;Japanese perspective, where all parallel lines remain parallel and do not meet at points of visual convergence.&quot; The shaky lines, often exacerbated by working on the ten hour train ride between Stockholm and Lund, is obvious in some of his pictures. Figures were frequently colored with Japanese colored chalk. In comparing his work to that of the much more famous artist of the impossible, M. C. Escher, it can be observed that Escher builds inhabited worlds around impossible objects, whereas Reutersvärd&#x27;s designs generally consist of pure geometric forms.

Reutersvärd produced more than 2,500 figures. In the late 1960s, several books were published featuring his work, and he attracted a following, with many international gallery exhibitions. Through the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to develop impossible figures, filling many notebooks. Finally, in the mid 1990s, his work was prominently commissioned for several public buildings in Sweden, and the National Museum of Sweden and Museum of Modern Art of Stockholm both displayed his work.

Today both mathematicians and psychologists use his drawings as templates for studying visual perception.

In addition to his development of impossible figures, he was a designer of many public works in Sweden, including large sculptures, mazes and architectural features.

Oscar Reutersvärd gave at the Conference &quot;Incontri con la matematica&quot; (Mathematical Conference held annually, since 1986, in Castel San Pietro Terme, Bologna, Italy) the ability to use his figures for the publications annually made for the Conference.

==Swedish postage stamps==
Reutersvärd&#x27;s achievements were honoured in 1982 by a series of three Swedish postage stamps. The stamps were engraved by Czesław Słania, based on watercolours by Reutersvärd. They remained in circulation for only about two years, after which they were withdrawn when the postage rate was changed. The Swedish government had the unused stamps destroyed; these scarce items are now eagerly sought collectibles.

<doc id="985295" wikidata="Q124079" url="?curid=985295" title="Walther Ritz">
<text>Walther Heinrich Wilhelm Ritz (22 February 1878 – 7 July 1909) was a Swiss theoretical physicist. He is most famous for his work with Johannes Rydberg on the Rydberg–Ritz combination principle. Ritz is also known for the variational method named after him, the Ritz method.

== Life ==
Walter Ritz&#x27;s father Raphael Ritz was born in Valais and was a well-known painter. His mother, born Nördlinger, was the daughter of an engineer from Tübingen. Ritz was a particularly gifted student and attended the municipal lyceum in Sion. In 1897, he entered the polytechnic school in Zürich, where he studied engineering. Soon, he found out that he could not live with the approximations and compromises associated with engineering, so he switched to the more mathematically accurate physical sciences.

In 1900, Ritz contracted tuberculosis, possibly also pleurisy, which he later died from. In 1901 he moved to Göttingen for health reasons. There he was influenced by Woldemar Voigt and David Hilbert. Ritz wrote a dissertation on spectral lines of atoms and received his doctorate with summa cum laude. The theme later led to the Ritz combination principle and in 1913 to the atomic model of Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr.

In the spring of 1903, he heard lectures by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz in Leiden on electrodynamic problems and his new electron theory. In June 1903 he was in Bonn at the Heinrich Kayser Institute, where he found in potash a spectral line that he had predicted in his dissertation. In November 1903, he was in Paris at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. There he worked on infrared photo plates.

In July 1904 his illness worsened and he moved back to Zürich. The disease prevented him from publishing further scientific publications until 1906. In September 1907 he moved to Tübingen, the place of origin of his mother, and in 1908 again to Göttingen, where he became a private lecturer at the university. There he published his work Recherches critiques sur l&#x27;Electrodynamique Générale, see below.

As a student, friend or colleague, Ritz had contacts with many contemporary scholars such as Hilbert, Andreas Heinrich Voigt, Hermann Minkowski, Lorentz, Aimé Cotton, Friedrich Paschen, Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein. He was a fellow student of Einstein in Zürich, while he studied there. Ritz was an opponent of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

Ritz died in Göttingen and was buried in the Nordheim cemetery in Zürich. The family tomb was lifted on 15 November 1999. His tombstone is in section 17 with the grave number 84457.

== Works ==

=== Criticism of Maxwell–Lorentz electromagnetic theory ===

Not so well known is the fact that in 1908 Ritz produced a lengthy criticism of Maxwell–Lorentz electromagnetic theory, in which he contended that the theory&#x27;s connection with the &quot;luminescent ether&quot; (see Lorentz ether theory) made it &quot;essentially inappropriate to express the comprehensive laws for the propagation of electrodynamic actions.&quot;

Ritz pointed out seven problems with Maxwell–Lorentz electromagnetic field equations:
* Electric and magnetic forces really express relations about space and time and should be replaced with non-instantaneous elementary actions.
* Advanced potentials don&#x27;t exist (and their erroneous use led to the Rayleigh–Jeans ultraviolet catastrophe).
* Localization of energy in the ether is vague.
* It is impossible to reduce gravity to the same notions.
* The unacceptable inequality of action and reaction is brought about by the concept of absolute motion with respect to the ether.
* Apparent relativistic mass increase is amenable to different interpretations.
* The use of absolute coordinates, if independent of all motions of matter, requires throwing away the time-honoured use of Galilean relativity and our notions of rigid ponderable bodies.

Instead, he indicated that light is not propagated (in a medium) but is projected. This theory, however, is considered to be refuted.

===Ritz&#x27;s method===
In 1909 Ritz developed a direct method to find an approximate solution for boundary value problems. It converts the often insoluble differential equation into the solution of a matrix equation. It is a theoretical preparatory work for the finite element method (FEM). This method is also known as Ritz&#x27;s variation principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz principle.

===Ritz&#x27;s combination principle===

In 1908, Ritz found empirically the Ritz combination principle named after him. After that, the sum or difference of the frequencies of two spectral lines is often the frequency of another line. Which of these calculated frequencies is actually observed was only explained later by selection rules, which follow from quantum mechanical calculations. The basis for this was the spectral line research (Balmer series) by Johann Jakob Balmer.

== Honours ==
*The lunar crater Ritz is named after him.

<text>The Pittsburgh Condors were a professional basketball team in the original American Basketball Association (ABA). Originally called the Pittsburgh Pipers, they were a charter franchise of the ABA and captured the first league title. The team played their home games in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Civic Arena.

==History==

===Pittsburgh Pipers - First ABA Champions (1967–1968)===

The Pipers were one of the ABA&#x27;s inaugural franchises in 1967. The team had great success on the court, posting the league&#x27;s best record during the regular season (54–24, .692) and winning the league&#x27;s first ABA Championship. The Pipers were led by their star player, ABA MVP and future Hall-of-Famer Connie Hawkins, who led the ABA in scoring at 26.8 ppg. The Pipers swept through the 1968 ABA Playoffs and defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers 4 games to 3 to take the title, with Hawkins earning Finals MVP honors. The ABA title remains Pittsburgh&#x27;s only pro basketball championship.

Coupled with the Philadelphia 76ers&#x27; NBA championship one year earlier, Pennsylvania had two professional basketball champions in as many years. Despite this, the team did not have a championship ring until over three decades later when players came up with money to have rings made.

The Pipers shared the Pittsburgh Civic Arena with the city&#x27;s expansion National Hockey League team, the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pipers attracted fairly respectable gates by ABA standards, averaging 3,200 fans per game.

===Minnesota Pipers (1968–1969)===
Despite the championship and strong attendance figures in Pittsburgh, the Pipers franchise left Pittsburgh after their 1968 ABA Championship and moved to Minnesota on June 28, 1968, becoming the Minnesota Pipers. Minnesota was left vacant when the Minnesota Muskies had trouble drawing people in the league&#x27;s first season and moved to Miami to become the Miami Floridians. The ABA league office was based in Minneapolis (home of league commissioner George Mikan), so the Pipers moved when a Minneapolis attorney named Bill Erickson bought a majority share of the team. As with the Muskies, their home arena was Bloomington&#x27;s Met Center. Despite making the playoffs (but losing in the first round to, coincidentally, the Miami Floridians), the Pipers&#x27; attendance settings fared no better than the Muskies and they moved back to Pittsburgh after only one season. In Terry Pluto&#x27;s book on the ABA, &quot;Loose Balls&quot;, Pipers co-owner Gabe Rubin says he returned to the Steel City because he couldn&#x27;t think of anywhere else to go. Professional basketball returned to Minnesota with the formation of the Timberwolves in 1989.

===Return of the Pittsburgh Pipers (1969–1970)===
For the first season back in Pittsburgh the team retained the &quot;Pipers&quot; nickname. However, the team failed to match their previous success and fans stayed away. After the season, Haven Industries, maker of the &quot;Jack Frost&quot; brand of sugar products, bought the team and decided a name change was in order.

===Pittsburgh Condors (1970–1972)===
====1970–71 season====
A &quot;name-the-team&quot; contest yielded the nickname &quot;Pioneers&quot;. However, local NAIA school Point Park College (now Point Park University) already had that nickname and threatened to sue. Ownership resolved the objection by changing the name to &quot;Condors&quot;.

Jack McMahon took over as coach. John Brisker and Mike Lewis played in the 1971 ABA All-Star Game, but the Condors could only manage a 36–48 record, fifth place in the Eastern Division and out of the playoffs (one game behind The Floridians). While the Condors had a potent offense (fifth in the 11-team ABA with 119.1 points per game), they were often undone by their defense (fourth-worst, allowing 121.8 ppg). Attendance remained poor, with an announced average of 2,806, though some observers close to the team thought the actual average was less than half that. After a slow (4–8) start, general manager Marty Blake decided (in an infamous ABA stunt) to &quot;give away&quot; every available seat for an early-season game against Florida on November 17. The game attracted the biggest crowd that the team would ever draw under the Condors name as 11,012 tickets were given out; however, only 8,074 (in a 12,300-seat arena) actually showed up. (3,000 season ticket holders didn&#x27;t even bother to attend the contest, which Pittsburgh lost, 122–116.) Ownership was not amused, and Blake was fired soon after.

The most memorable moment of the season came when Charlie &quot;Helicopter&quot; Hentz destroyed two backboards in a game against the Carolina Cougars.

====1971–72 season====
For the next season, Haven tried to change the Condors&#x27; image, with a new logo and uniforms, plus a slick marketing campaign. In October, they lured the defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks (and star Lew Alcindor) to Pittsburgh for an exhibition game, guaranteeing the Bucks $25,000. A local ad proclaimed &quot;Bring on Alcindor&quot; and that &quot;the ABA-NBA merger is here&quot;. (The merger would not actually happen until 1976, and it would not include Pittsburgh.) Unfortunately for the Condors, Alcindor—who had changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just a few days before the game—was injured and did not play (the Bucks won anyway, 129–115). Only 8,881 fans showed up, and the Condors &quot;took a bath&quot; on the deal—not a good start for the season.

After a 4–6 start, general manager Mark Binstein fired McMahon and named himself head coach, citing a need for the team to have &quot;more discipline&quot;. The move backfired disastrously; the Condors only went 21-50 the rest of the way.

As the season progressed, attendance dropped below 1,000 fans per game, fueling speculation the Condors would fold before Christmas. While they did manage to survive into the New Year, Haven had finally seen enough and announced the Condors would be playing elsewhere for the 1972–73 season. In the meantime, they began relocating home games, first to other cities in Pennsylvania, and then to farther-away places. On March 24, 1972, the Condors hosted the Kentucky Colonels in Birmingham, Alabama; four days later, the Condors hosted the Colonels again, this time in their last &#x27;home&#x27; game, in Tucson, Arizona.

John Brisker and George Thompson played in the ABA All-Star Game. The Condors finished in sixth place in the Eastern Division at 25-59 and failed to make the playoffs. They averaged 2,215 fans per home game—a figure that would have been even lower if not for the gates brought in at both Birmingham (an estimated 3,000) and Tucson (reported as 5,000). These were significantly better than the ones in Pittsburgh; the Condors drew only 689 at their final game at the Civic Center.

===Decline and folding===
Haven and the league tried to move the Condors to a bigger market. It was said that some locations that the team and the ABA were looking into in addition to Birmingham and Tucson were Cincinnati, El Paso, New Haven, and even San Diego similar to The Floridians around that same period of time for that last location. However, they were unable to do so, and on June 13, 1972, the ABA shut down the Condors franchise alongside The Floridians franchise. The Condors&#x27; roster was put into a dispersal draft; George Thompson went to the Memphis Tams, Mike Lewis to the Carolina Cougars, Skeeter Swift and James Silas to the Dallas Chaparrals, and Walt Szczerbiak to the Kentucky Colonels. John Brisker jumped to the Seattle SuperSonics of the NBA soon afterward. Ironically, a new team would replace both franchises in San Diego with the San Diego Conquistadors later that year.

<doc id="985298" wikidata="Q1042202" url="?curid=985298" title="Denki Groove">
<text>is a Japanese music group founded in 1989. It consists of Takkyu Ishino and Pierre Taki.

==History==
Denki Groove was founded in 1989 by Takkyu Ishino and Pierre Taki, both of whom are natives of Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture. They formed on April 26, the same day their predecessor group, ZIN-SÄY! disbanded.

The group&#x27;s major-label debut studio album, &quot;Flash Papa&quot;, was released in 1991, the first being &quot;662 BPM by DG&quot; in 1990. They also released a few albums, including &quot;U.F.O.&quot; (1991), &quot;Karateka&quot; (1992), &quot;Vitamin&quot; (1993), &quot;Dragon&quot; (1994), &quot;Orange&quot; (1996), &quot;A&quot; (1997), and &quot;Voxxx&quot; (2000). Their single, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, had sold more than half a million copies. They went on hiatus between 2001 and 2004.

In 2019, Pierre Taki was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession. In response, Sony Music Entertainment Japan took Denki Groove&#x27;s recordings off the shelves and stopped streaming the group&#x27;s music. Streaming services were resumed on June 19, 2020.

<doc id="985304" wikidata="Q2415347" url="?curid=985304" title="Deadly Blessing">
<text>Deadly Blessing is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven. The film tells the story of a strange figure committing murder in a contemporary community that is not far from another community that believes in ancient evil and curses. It stars Ernest Borgnine, Maren Jensen, Susan Buckner (both women making their last feature film screen appearances), and Sharon Stone in an early role. AllMovie comments that the film &quot;finds director Wes Craven in a transitional phase between his hard-hitting early work and his later commercial successes.&quot;

== Plot ==
Martha and Jim Schmidt live on an isolated farm named &quot;Our Blessing.&quot; Most of their neighbors are &quot;Hittites&quot;, an austere religious community led by Isaiah Schmidt who forbids any interaction with non-Hittites. After breaking up a fight between one Hittite member, William Gluntz and another, more artistically minded neighbor, Faith Stohler, Jim finds &quot;incubus&quot; scrawled on the wall of his barn. Later that night, Jim is killed when his tractor suddenly starts up and crushes him against the wall. Isaiah and other Hittites observe Jim&#x27;s funeral, as he was a lapsed member of their community; they consider Martha to be an incubus for having lured him away from their religion.

Martha&#x27;s friends Lana Marcus and Vicky Anderson visit the farm, hoping to persuade her to return to Los Angeles. While creeping around Our Blessing at night, William is stabbed in the back by a black-dressed figure. The following day, while looking for William, Isaiah, who was Jim&#x27;s father, offers to buy the farm from Martha, but she angrily refuses. Lana is nearly trapped in the barn by the black-dressed figure. As she escapes, she finds William&#x27;s corpse hanging from a rope. The Sheriff advises the three friends to leave town, as someone may be after them. However, they decide to stay. When Isaiah finds out that Jim&#x27;s brother John has been seeing Vicky, he beats then exiles him. John meets Vicky outside the cinema and she lets John drive her car, giving him a sense of freedom. They stop at the side of a road and begin to make out but they are killed by the black-dressed figure.

Lana, overwhelmed by disturbing dreams, begins to believe that death is pursuing her. Martha discovers that Jim&#x27;s grave has been dug up and the casket filled with chickens from the Stohlers&#x27; farm. In their barn, she finds Jim&#x27;s body and an altar to her. John&#x27;s estranged fiancée Melissa arrives reciting a ritual of exorcism but is attacked by Faith&#x27;s mother, Louisa. Faith and Louisa, who hate the Hittites, have been the black-dressed figures murdering them. Martha struggles with them and tears open Faith&#x27;s shirt, revealing her to be a man who has been in love with Martha. They pursue Martha to Our Blessing. There, Lana kills Louisa and a late-arriving Melissa stabs Faith to death. In a religious fervor, Melissa threatens Martha next, but an even-more-late-arriving Isaiah assures her that the messenger of the incubus has already been killed.

The day after, Lana returns to LA. Though Jim&#x27;s ghost tries to warn her, the incubus bursts through the floor and drags Martha to hell.

== Cast ==

* Maren Jensen as Martha Schmidt
* Sharon Stone as Lana Marcus
* Susan Buckner as Vicky Anderson
* Jeff East as John Schmidt
* Colleen Riley as Melissa
* Douglas Barr as Jim Schmidt
* Lisa Hartman as Faith Stohler
* Lois Nettleton as Louisa Stohler
* Ernest Borgnine as Isaiah Schmidt
* Michael Berryman as William Gluntz
* Kevin Cooney as Sheriff
== Production ==
The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, Texas. Actor Michael Berryman had previously worked with Craven on &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; playing a similar character.

Universal Pictures, the primary distributor for PolyGram-produced films at the time, chose not to pick up the finished project; it was instead released in theatres by United Artists and was the final United Artists film to be owned by Transamerica Corporation after being acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on July 28, 1981.

== Reception ==
Academy Award-winner Ernest Borgnine was nominated for a Razzie award for &quot;Worst Supporting Actor&quot; for this film.

&quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; has been poorly received by critics. It currently holds a 33% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews with an average rating of 4.70/10. AllMovie called the film ultimately disappointing, but wrote that it has &quot;enough eccentricities and stylish flourishes to make it worthwhile for fans of vintage horror.&quot; Time Out wrote, &quot;&quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; isn&#x27;t a very good movie, but it holds out distinct promise that Craven will soon be in the front rank of horror filmmakers&quot;, calling it &quot;an excellent example of a mundane project elevated into quite a palatable genre movie by its director.&quot;

== Home media ==
On January 22, 2013, Shout! Factory released a Collector&#x27;s Edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD under license from Universal Studios.

<text>John Davidson (11 April 1857 – 23 March 1909) was a Scottish poet, playwright and novelist, best known for his ballads. He also did translations from French. In 1909, financial difficulties, as well as physical and mental health problems, led to his suicide.

==Life and works==
===Scotland===

He was born at Barrhead, East Renfrewshire as the son of Alexander Davidson, an Evangelical Union minister and Helen &quot;née&quot; Crocket of Elgin. His family removed to Greenock in 1862 where he was educated at Highlanders&#x27; Academy there and entered the chemical laboratory of Walker&#x27;s Sugarhouse refinery in his 13th year, returning after one year to school as a pupil teacher. Davidson also briefly worked in the Public Analysts&#x27; Office, from 1870 to 1871. In these employments he developed an interest in science which became an important characteristic of his poetry. In 1872 he returned for four years to the Highlanders&#x27; Academy as a pupil-teacher, and, after a year at University of Edinburgh (1876–77), received in 1877 his first scholastic employment at Alexander&#x27;s Charity, Glasgow. During the next six years he held positions in the following schools : Perth Academy (1878–81), Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow (1881–82), and Hutchinson&#x27;s Charity, Paisley (1883–84). He varied his career by spending a year as clerk in a Glasgow thread firm (1884–85), and subsequently taught in Morrison&#x27;s Academy, Crieff (1885–88), and in a private school at Greenock (1888–89).

===London===
Having taken to literature, he went in 1889 to London where he frequented &#x27;Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese&#x27; and joined the &#x27;Rhymers&#x27; Club&#x27;. Davidson&#x27;s first published work was &quot; Bruce,&quot; a chronicle play in the Elizabethan manner, which appeared with a Glasgow imprint in 1886. Four other plays, &quot;Smith, a Tragic Farce&quot; (1888), &quot;An Unhistorical Pastoral&quot; (1889), &quot;Aromantic Farce&quot; (1889), and the brilliant pantomimic &quot;Scaramouch in Naxos&quot; (1889) were also published while he was in Scotland.

Besides writing for the &quot;Speaker,&quot; the &quot;Glasgow Herald,&quot; and other papers, he produced several novels and tales, of which the best was &quot;Perfervid&quot; (1890). But these prose works were written for a livelihood.

===Verse===

Davidson&#x27;s true medium was verse. &quot; In a Music Hall and other Poems&quot; (1891) suggested what &quot;Fleet Street Eclogues&quot; (1893) proved, that Davidson possessed a genuine and distinctive poetic gift. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read both these volumes in one day in 1893 at the British Museum Library. Yeats had words of praise for &quot;In a Music Hall&quot;. He called it, &quot;An example of a new writer seeking out &#x27;new subject matter, new emotions&#x27;&quot;. Yeats wrote of his emotional dispute with Davidson in &quot;Autobiographies&quot; (1955). The second collection established his reputation among the discerning few. His early plays were republished in one volume in 1894, and henceforward he turned his attention more and more completely to verse. A volume of vigorous &quot;Ballads and Songs&quot; (1894), his most popular work, which Davidson sent a copy of to George Gissing, who wrote that it &quot;gave me thoughts&quot;, was followed in turn by a second series of &quot;Fleet Street Eclogues&quot; (1896) and by &quot;New Ballads&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Last Ballad&quot; (1899).

===Dramatic works===
For a time he abandoned lyric for the drama, writing several original plays.

===&#x27;Testaments&#x27;===
Finally Davidson engaged on a series of &quot;Testaments&quot;, in which he gave definite expression to his philosophy. These volumes were entitled &quot;The Testament of a Vivisector&quot; (1901),&quot;The Testament of a Man Forbid&quot; (1901), &quot;The Testament of an Empire Builder&quot; (1902), and &quot;The Testament of John Davidson&quot; (1908). Though he disclaimed the title of philosopher, he expounded an original philosophy which was at once materialistic and aristocratic. The cosmic process, as interpreted by evolution, was for him a fruitful source of inspiration.

His later verse, which is often fine rhetoric rather than poetry, expressed the belief which is summed up in the last words that he wrote, &quot;Men are the universe become conscious; the simplest man should consider himself too great to be called after any name.&quot; The corollary was that every man was to be himself to the utmost of his power, and the strongest was to rule. Davidson professed to reject all existing philosophies, including that of Nietzsche, as inadequate, but Nietzsche&#x27;s influence is traceable in his argument. The poet planned ultimately to embody his revolutionary creed in a trilogy entitled &quot; God and Mammon&quot;. Only two plays, however, were written, &quot;The Triumph of Mammon&quot; (1907) and &quot;Mammon and his Message&quot; (1908).

===Family===
In 1885 Davidson married Margaret, daughter of John McArthur of Perth. She survived him with two sons, Alexander (b. 1887) and Menzies (b. 1889).

===Other works===

Davidson was a prolific writer. Besides the works cited, he wrote many other works, including &quot;The Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender&quot; (1895), a novel which included flagellation erotica, and he contributed an introduction to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Sonnets&quot; (Renaissance edition, 1908), which, like his various prefaces and essays, shows him a subtle literary critic.

===Translations===
He translated Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Lettres Persanes&quot; (1892), François Coppée&#x27;s &quot;Pour la Couronne&quot; in 1896 and Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; in 1904, the former being produced as, &quot;For the Crown&quot;, at the Lyceum Theatre in 1896, the latter as &quot;A Queen&#x27;s Romance&quot; at the Imperial Theatre.

===Portraits===

Davidson&#x27;s portrait was drawn by Walter Sickert and by Robert Bryden. A caricature by Max Beerbohm appeared in &quot;The Chapbook,&quot; (1907), and William Rothenstein did a portrait of him for &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;. In &quot;Men and Memories&quot; (1931), Rothenstein said that when Max Beerbohm looked at his pictures of Davidson, he had complimented him on the &#x27;subtle way he had handled his toupée&#x27;. Rothenstein wrote that he had not noticed that he was wearing one.

Frank Harris, a member of the Rhymers&#x27; Club described him in 1889 thus:&quot;... a little below middle height, but strongly built with square shoulders and remarkably fine face and head; the features were almost classically regular, the eyes dark brown and large, the forehead high, the hair and moustache black. His manners were perfectly frank and natural; he met everyone in the same unaffected kindly human way; I never saw a trace in him of snobbishness or incivility. Possibly a great man, I said to myself, certainly a man of genius, for simplicity of manner alone is in England almost a proof of extraordinary endowment.&quot;

===Drowning===

In 1906 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 &quot;per annum&quot; and George Bernard Shaw did what he could to help him financially, but poverty, ill-health, and his declining powers, exacerbated by the onset of cancer, caused profound hopelessness and clinical depression. Late in 1908, Davidson left London to reside at Penzance. On 23 March 1909, he disappeared from his house there, under circumstances which left little doubt that he had drowned himself. Among his papers was found the manuscript of a new work, &quot;Fleet Street Poems&quot;, with a letter containing the words, &quot;This will be my last book.&quot; His body, which was discovered by some fishermen in Mount&#x27;s Bay on 18 September, was, in accordance with his known wishes, buried at sea. In his will he desired that no biography should be written, none of his unpublished works published, and &quot;no word except of my writing is ever to appear in any book of mine as long as the copyright endures.&quot;

The assumption that he took his own life is consistent with what is known of his temperament and his ideas. In &quot;The Testament of John Davidson&quot;, published the year before his death, he anticipates this fate:

:&quot;None should outlive his power. . . . Who kills
: Himself subdues the conqueror of kings;
: Exempt from death is he who takes his life;
: My time has come.&quot;

===Influence on other poets===
Davidson&#x27;s poetry was a key early influence on important Modernist poets, in particular, his compatriot Hugh MacDiarmid and Wallace Stevens. T.S. Eliot was especially fond of the poem &#x27;Thirty Bob a Week&#x27; (In &quot;Ballads and Songs&quot; (1894)). Davidson&#x27;s poem &quot;In the Isle of Dogs&quot;, for example, is a clear intertext of later poems such as Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and Stevens&#x27; &quot;The Idea of Order at Key West&quot;.

<text> (Danish for &quot;Turkish pepper&quot;, often referred to as &#x27; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]],&#x27; in German, &#x27; in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and&#x27; in Swedish) is a salty liquorice candy flavoured with salmiac (ammonium chloride), produced by the Finnish company Fazer and popular in Northern Europe. It was first launched in 1977 by the Danish company Perelly, but was acquired by Fazer in 1996.
The basic variant is a large, hollow, round shell both coated and filled with ammonium chloride powder. It is sold in dark blue, flame-decorated bags. The product family has later expanded to include the &quot;Hot &amp; Sour&quot; (a milder variant of the traditional design, produced in four different flavours; Spicy Citrus, Pepper Liquorice, Chilli Melon and Strawberry Surprise) and &quot;Bonfire&quot; (soft, much milder candies) bagged variants, as well as lollipops and filled liquorice. There has also been a chili-flavoured version and a strongly licorice-flavoured version with less of the ammonium chloride and peppercorn flavouring, but these have since been discontinued. However, the licorice-flavoured variant can still be found as one of the flavours in the &quot;Hot &amp; Sour&quot; bags. In Northern Europe there are competing different versions of salmiac-based candy, including &#x27; (frog shaped candies),&#x27; and &quot;&quot;.

 is used to make the Finnish candy shot &quot;Salmiakki Koskenkorva&quot; and in similar Scandinavian drinks. When Perelly manufactured , it was also available as powder which was often used to make a drink known in Denmark as &#x27;,&#x27;, &quot;hot shot&quot; or &#x27;, in Sweden as&#x27;, and in Norway as &#x27;,&#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

<text>Grange Hill is a London Underground station. It lies in the parish of Chigwell in the Epping Forest district of Essex. The boundary with the London Borough of Redbridge is immediately to the east of the station buildings. The station is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Hainault and Chigwell stations. It has been in Travelcard Zone 4 since 2 January 2007.

==History==
The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 1 May 1903 on their Fairlop Loop line between Woodford and Ilford.

As a consequence of the Railways Act 1921, the GER was merged with other railway companies in 1923 to become part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). As part of the 1935–1940 New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board the majority of the Woodford to Ilford loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line. Although work commenced in 1938 it was suspended upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and work only recommenced in 1946. In connection with the alterations required for the electrification of the line, the station was closed from 29 November 1947. It reopened and was first served by the Central line from 21 November 1948. The station ticket office was reconstructed as part of this work following destruction of the original building by a German V1 &#x27;Doodlebug&#x27; in July 1944. The 1903 building was very similar to the next station to the north, Chigwell, which is still largely untouched to this day, and the original building further south at Newbury Park, demolished in 1956 to make way for a road improvement.

From the mid-1960s until the early 1990s the Woodford-Hainault section was largely separately operated from the rest of the Central line, using four car (later three car) trains of 1960 Stock. These trains were adapted for Automatic Train Operation (ATO); the Woodford-Hainault section became the testing ground for ATO on the Victoria line. The separate operation has now been abolished and through trains to Central London via Hainault now operate. At the beginning of the morning and evening peak periods, some trains starting from Hainault depot enter service at Grange Hill and work to central London via Woodford, although in the current timetable, only one train returns to Hainault depot via Grange Hill, the majority doing so instead via Newbury Park and Hainault.

Since 5 February 2006 this has been one of the small number of stations on the network to have no staffed ticket office. However, staff are available 24 hours a day for customer information and the train service has been extended to midnight to take into account the rising passenger numbers.
==Services==
Grange Hill station is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Hainault and Chigwell. The typical off-peak services are:

*3 trains per hour to Hainault
*3 trains per hour to Woodford

At morning rush hour, there are three trains that run to West Ruislip.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 362 and 462 serve the station.

<doc id="985324" wikidata="Q754194" url="?curid=985324" title="St Mark's Campanile">
<text>St Mark&#x27;s Campanile (, ) is the bell tower of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, Italy. The current campanile is a reconstruction completed in 1912, the previous tower having collapsed in 1902. At in height, it is the tallest structure in Venice and is colloquially termed &quot;el paròn de casa&quot; (the master of the house). It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city.

Located in Saint Mark&#x27;s Square near the mouth of the Grand Canal, the campanile was initially intended as a watchtower to sight approaching ships and protect the entry to the city. It also served as a landmark to guide Venetian ships safely into harbour. Construction began in the early tenth century and continued sporadically over time as the tower was slowly raised in height. A belfry and a spire were first added in the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century the spire was gilded, making the tower visible to distant ships in the Adriatic. The campanile reached its full height in 1514 when the belfry and spire were completely rebuilt on the basis of an earlier Renaissance design by Giorgio Spavento. Historically, the bells served to regulate the civic and religious life of Venice, marking the beginning, pauses, and end of the work day; the convocation of government assemblies; and public executions.

The campanile stands alone in the square, near the front of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. It has a simple form, recalling its early defensive function, the bulk of which is a square brick shaft with lesenes, wide on each side and tall. The belfry is topped by an attic with effigies of the Lion of St Mark and allegorical figures of Venice as Justice. The tower is capped by a pyramidal spire at the top of which there is a golden weather vane in the form of the archangel Gabriel.
==Historical background==
The Magyar raids into northern Italy in 898 and again in 899 resulted in the plundering and brief occupation of the important mainland cities of Cittanova, Padua, and Treviso as well as several smaller towns and settlements in and around the Venetian Lagoon. Although the Venetians ultimately defeated the Magyars on the Lido of Albiola on 29 June 900 and repelled the incursion, Venice remained vulnerable by way of the deep navigable channel that allowed access to the harbour from the sea. In particular, the young city was threatened by the Slavic pirates who routinely menaced Venetian shipping lanes in the Adriatic.

A series of fortifications was consequently erected during the reign of Doge Pietro Tribuno () to protect Venice from invasion by sea. These fortifications included a wall that started at the &quot;rivulus de Castello&quot; (Rio del Palazzo), just east of the Doge&#x27;s Castle, and eventually extended along the waterfront to the area occupied by the early Church of Santa Maria Iubanico. However, the exact location of the wall has not been determined nor how long it was there beyond the period of crisis.

Integral to this defensive network, an iron harbour chain that could be pulled taut across the Grand Canal to impede navigation and block access to the centre of the city was installed at the height of San Gregorio. In addition, a massive watchtower was built in Saint Mark&#x27;s Square. Probably begun during the reign of Tribuno, it was also intended to serve as a point of reference to guide Venetian ships safely into the harbour, which at that time occupied a substantial part of the area corresponding to the present-day piazzetta.

==Construction==
===Tower===
The defensive system begun under Pietro Tribuno was likely provisional, and construction may have been limited to the reinforcement of pre-existing structures. Medieval chronicles suggest that the laying of the foundation for the tower continued during the reigns of his immediate successors, Orso II Participazio () and Pietro II Candiano (). Delays were likely due to the difficulty in developing suitable construction techniques as well as locating and importing building materials. Some of the early bricks dated from the late Roman Empire and were salvaged from ruins on the mainland. For the foundation, alder piles, roughly in length and in diameter, were driven into a dense layer of clay located around below the surface. The piles were topped with two layers of oak planking on which multiple layers of stone were laid.

Fabrication of the actual tower seems to have begun during the brief reign of Pietro Participazio () but did not progress far. Political strife during the ensuing reigns of Pietro III Candiano () and, particularly, Pietro IV Candiano () precluded further work. Under Pietro I Orseolo (), construction resumed, and it advanced considerably during the reign of Tribuno Memmo (). No further additions were made to the tower until the time of Domenico Selvo (), an indication that it had reached a serviceable height and could be used to control access to the city. Selvo increased the height to around , which corresponded with the fifth of the eight present windows. Doge Domenico Morosini () then raised the height to the actual level of the belfry and is credited with the construction of the bell tower. His portrait in the Doge&#x27;s Palace shows him together with a scroll that lists the significant events of his reign, among which is the construction of the bell tower: &quot;Sub me admistrandi operis campanile Sancti Marci construitur...&quot;.

===Belfry and spire===

The first belfry was added under Vitale II Michiel (). It was surmounted by a pyramidal spire in wood that was sheathed with copper plates. Around 1329, the belfry was restored and the spire reconstructed. The spire itself was particularly prone to fire due to the wooden framework. It burned when lightning struck the tower on 7 June 1388, but it was nevertheless rebuilt in wood. On this occasion, the copper plates were covered in gold leaf, rendering the tower visible to distant ships in the Adriatic. Marcantonio Sabellico records in his guide to the city, &quot;De Venetae urbis situ&quot; (), that mariners looked to the gilded spire as a &#x27;welcoming star&#x27;: 
The spire was once again destroyed in 1403 when flames from a bonfire lit to illuminate the tower in celebration of the Venetian victory over the Genoese at the Battle of Modon enveloped the wooden frame. It was rebuilt between 1405 and 1406. Lightning again struck the tower during a violent storm on 11 August 1489, setting ablaze the spire which eventually crashed into the square below. The bells fell to the floor of the belfry, and the masonry of the tower itself cracked. In response to this latest calamity, the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot;, the government officials responsible for the public buildings around Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, decided to rebuild the belfry and spire completely in masonry so as to prevent future fires. The commission was given to their &quot;proto&quot; (consultant architect and buildings manager), Giorgio Spavento. Although the design was submitted within a few months, the estimated cost was 50,000 ducats, and financial constraints in the period of recovery from the wars in Lombardy against Milan (1423–1454) delayed construction. Instead, Spavento limited repairs to the structural damage to the tower. A temporary clay-tile roof was placed over the belfry, and the bells that were still intact were rehung. The outbreak in 1494 of the Italian wars for the control of the mainland precluded any further action.

On 26 March 1511, a violent earthquake further damaged the fragile structure and opened a long fissure on the northern side of the tower, making it necessary to immediately intervene. Upon the initiative of procurator Antonio Grimani, the temporary roof and the belfry were removed and preparations were made to finally execute Spavento&#x27;s design. The work was carried out under the direction of who had succeeded Spavento as &quot;proto&quot; in 1509. To finance the initial work, the procurators sold unclaimed objects in precious metals that had been deposited in the treasury of St Mark&#x27;s in 1414 for a value of 6,000 ducats. By 1512, the tower itself had been completely repaired, and work began on the new belfry made in Istrian stone.

The four sides of the brick attic above have high-relief sculptures in contrasting Istrian stone. The eastern and western sides have allegorical figures of Venice, presented as a personification of Justice with the sword and the scales. She sits on a throne supported by lions on either side in allusion to the throne of Solomon, the king of ancient Israel renowned for his wisdom and judgement. This theme of Venice as embodying, rather than invoking, the virtue of Justice is common in Venetian state iconography and is recurrent on the façade of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The remaining sides of the attic have the lion of Saint Mark, the symbol of the Venetian Republic.

On 6 July 1513 a wooden statue of the archangel Gabriel, plated in copper and gilded, was placed at the top of the spire. In his diary, Marin Sanudo recorded the event: 

A novelty with respect to the earlier tower, the statue also functioned as a weather vane, turning so that it always faced into the wind. Francesco Sansovino suggested in his guide to the city, &quot;Venetia città nobilissima et singolare&quot; (1581), that the idea of a weather vane atop the new tower derived from Vitruvius’ description of the Tower of the Winds in Athens which had a bronze triton mounted on a pivot. But the specific choice of the archangel Gabriel was meant to recall the legend of Venice&#x27;s foundation on the 25 March 421, the feast of the Annunciation. In Venetian historiography, the legend, traceable to the thirteenth century, conflated the beginning of the Christian era with the birth of Venice as a Christian republic and affirmed Venice&#x27;s unique place and role in history as an act of divine grace. As a construct, it is expressed in the frequent representations of the Annunciation throughout Venice, most notably on the façade of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica and in the reliefs by Agostino Rubini at the base of the Rialto Bridge, depicting the Virgin Mary opposite the archangel Gabriel.

As recorded by Marin Sanudo, structural work on the tower terminated in June 1514. The remaining work was completed by October 1514, including the gilding of the spire.

===Loggetta===
In the fifteenth century, the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot; erected a covered exterior gallery attached to the bell tower. It was a lean-to wooden structure, partially enclosed, that served as a gathering place for nobles whenever they came to the square on government business. It also provided space for the procurators who occasionally met there and for the sentries who protected the entry to the Doge&#x27;s Palace whenever the Great Council was in session.

Over time, it was repeatedly damaged by falling masonry from the bell tower as a result of storm and earthquake but was repaired after each incident. However, when lightning struck the bell tower on 11 August 1537 and the loggia underneath was once again damaged, the decision came to completely rebuild the structure. The commission was given to the sculptor and architect Jacopo Sansovino, the immediate successor to Bon as &quot;proto&quot; to the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot;. It was completed in 1546.

The remaining three sides of the bell tower were covered with wooden lean-to stalls, destined for retail activities. These were an additional source of revenue for the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot; and were leased in order to finance the maintenance of the buildings in the square. The lean-to stalls were removed in 1873.

==Later history==
Throughout its history, the bell tower remained susceptible to damage from storms. Lightning struck in 1548, 1562, 1565, and 1567. On each occasion, repairs were carried out under the direction of Jacopo Sansovino, responsible as &quot;proto&quot; for the maintenance of the buildings administered by the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot;, including the bell tower. The work, funded from the accounts of the procurators, was typically executed by carpenters provided by the Arsenal, the government shipyards. The tower was damaged twice in 1582.
In the following centuries, it was repeatedly necessary to intervene and repair the damage caused by lightning. In 1653, Baldassarre Longhena took up repairs after lightning struck, having become &quot;proto&quot; in 1640. The damage must have been extensive on this occasion, given the repair cost of 1,230 ducats. Significant work was also necessary to repair damage done after lightning struck on 23 April 1745, causing some of the masonry to crack and killing four people in the square as a result of falling stonework. The campanile was again damaged by lightning in 1761 and 1762. Repair costs on the second occasion reached the considerable sum of 3,329 ducats. Finally, on 18 March 1776, the physicist Giuseppe Toaldo, professor of astronomy at the University of Padua, installed a lightning rod, the first in Venice.

Periodic work was also needed to repair damage to the tower and the statue of the archangel Gabriel from wind and rain erosion. The original statue was replaced in 1557 with a smaller version. After numerous restorations, this was in turn substituted in 1822 by a statue designed by , professor at the &quot;Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia&quot;.

The tower remained of strategic importance to the city. Access to visiting foreign dignitaries was allowed only by the Signoria, the executive body of the government, and ideally at high tide when it was not possible to distinguish the navigable channels in the lagoon. On 21 August 1609, Galileo Galilei demonstrated his telescope to the procurator Antonio Priuli and other nobles from the belfry. Three days later, the telescope was presented to doge Leonardo Donato from the loggia of the Doge&#x27;s Palace.

==Bells==
===History===
A bell was most likely first installed in the tower during the tenure of Doge Vitale II Michiel. However, documents that attest to the presence of a bell are traceable only from the thirteenth century. A deliberation of the Great Council, dated 8 July 1244, established that the bell to convene the council was to be rung in the evening if the council was to meet the following morning and in the early afternoon if the meeting was scheduled for the evening of the same day. There is a similar reference to the bell in the statute of the ironmongers&#x27; guild, dating to 1271.

Over time, the number of bells varied. In 1489, there were at least six. Four were present in the sixteenth century until 1569 when a fifth was added. Beginning in 1678 the bell brought to Venice from Crete after the island was lost to the Ottoman Turks, called the &quot;Campanon da Candia&quot;, hung in the tower, but it fell to the floor of the belfry in 1722, and was not resuspended. After this time, five bells remained. These were named (from smallest to largest) &quot;Maleficio&quot; (also &quot;Renghiera&quot; or &quot;Preghiera&quot;), &quot;Trottiera&quot; (also &quot;Dietro Nona&quot;), &quot;Meza-terza&quot; (also &quot;Pregadi&quot;), &quot;Nona&quot;, and &quot;Marangona&quot;.

The historical accounts of the damage to the tower caused by lightning make reference to broken bells, an indication that the bells must have been recast at various times. Nonetheless, the first documented instance concerns the &quot;Trottiera&quot;, which was recast in 1731. The resulting sound was unsatisfactory, and the bell had to be recast two more times before it harmonized with the older bells. After the designation of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica as the cathedral of Venice (1807), the &quot;Marangona&quot; and &quot;Renghiera&quot;, together with the &quot;Campanon da Candia&quot; and other bells from former churches, were recast by Domenico Canciani Dalla Venezia into two larger bronze bells between 1808 and 1809, but these were melted with the &quot;Meza-terza&quot;, &quot;Trottiera&quot;, and &quot;Nona&quot; in 1820, again by Dalla Venezia, to create a new series of five bells. Of these bells, only the &quot;Marangona&quot; survived the collapse of the bell tower in 1902.

===Functions===

In various combinations, the bells indicated the times of the day and coordinated activities throughout the city. Four of the bells also had specific functions in relation to the activities of the Venetian government.

====Times of the day====

At dawn, with the first appearance of daylight, the &quot;Meza-terza&quot; rang (16 series of 18 strokes). The &quot;Marangona&quot; followed at sunrise (16 series of 18 strokes). This signalled the opening of the Church of St Mark for prayer and of the loggetta at the base of the bell tower. The gates of the Jewish Ghetto were also opened. The ringing of the &quot;Marangona&quot; also notified labourers to prepare for the workday which, determined by sunlight, varied in length throughout the year. The &quot;Marangona&quot;, the largest bell, derived its name from this particular function in reference to the &quot;marangoni&quot; (carpenters) who worked in the Arsenal. After the &quot;Marangona&quot; ceased, a half hour of silence followed. The &quot;Meza-terza&quot; then rang continuously for thirty minutes. The bell derived its name, &quot;Meza-terza&quot; (half third), from the time of the day since it rang between sunrise and Third Hour (Terce), the traditional moment of the liturgical mid-morning prayer. At the end of the thirty minutes, holy mass was celebrated in St Mark&#x27;s. Also, the workday began for the workmen in the Arsenal, the artisans &quot;da grosso&quot; (heavy mechanical trades), and government officials. Labourers who were not present for work did not receive full wages for the day. Shop hours and the workday of some artisan guilds were regulated by the &quot;Realtina&quot;, the bell located in the tower of the Church of San Giovanni Elemosinario at Rialto.


Third Hour was signalled by the ringing of the &quot;Marangona&quot; (15 series of 16 strokes).

The &quot;Nona&quot; derived its name from Ninth Hour (Nones), the traditional moment of the liturgical afternoon prayer. It sounded (16 series of 18 strokes) at midday and marked the beginning of the work break. After the &quot;Nona&quot; ceased, a half hour of silence ensued. The &quot;Trottiera&quot; then rang continuously for 30 minutes: from this particular function, the &quot;Trottiera&quot; was also termed &quot;Dietro Nona&quot; (behind, or after, &quot;Nona&quot;). When the ringing stopped, work began again. An hour later, the &quot;Nona&quot; rang (9 series of 10 strokes for three times) to mark the vespertine Ave Maria which was followed by the &quot;Marangona&quot; (15 series of 16 strokes).

The &quot;Marangona&quot; rang (15 series of 16 strokes) at sunset which corresponded to 24 hours and the end of the workday for the Arsenal, the heavy mechanical trades, and the government offices. An hour after sunset, the &quot;Meza-terza&quot; rang for 12 minutes, signalling that the night watch was required to be present in Saint Mark&#x27;s Square. After a twelve-minute pause, the &quot;Nona&quot; rang for 12 minutes. This indicated that letters were to be taken to Rialto for dispatch. After another 12 minutes, the &quot;Marangona&quot; struck for 12 minutes, ending at two hours after sunset. The night watch then began. The &quot;Realtina&quot; signalled the moment to extinguish fires in the homes.

Midnight was marked by the ringing of the &quot;Marangona&quot; (16 series of 18 strokes).

====Public executions====

The smallest bell, known alternatively as the &quot;Renghiera&quot;, &quot;Maleficio&quot;, or &quot;Preghiera&quot;, signalled public executions by ringing for 30 minutes. The bell had previously been located in the Doge&#x27;s Palace and is mentioned in connection with the execution for treason of Doge Marin Falier in 1355. In 1569, it was moved to the tower. The earliest name, &quot;Renghiera&quot;, derived from &quot;renga&quot; (harangue) in reference to the court proceedings within the Palace. The alternative name of &quot;Maleficio&quot;, from &quot;malus&quot; (evil, wicked), recalled the criminal act, whereas &quot;Preghiera&quot; (prayer) invoked supplications for the soul of the condemned. After the execution, the &quot;Marangona&quot; was rung for a half hour and then the &quot;Meza-terza&quot;. Whenever capital punishment was ordered by the Council of Ten, the &quot;Maleficio&quot; rang immediately after the &quot;Marangona&quot; of sunrise and the sentence was carried out in the morning. Death sentences issued by the &quot;Quarantia al Criminal&quot; or the Lords of the Night were carried out in the afternoon, the &quot;Maleficio&quot; ringing immediately after the &quot;Dietro Nona&quot; ended.

====Convocation of government assemblies====

The &quot;Marangona&quot; announced the sessions of the Great Council. In the event that the council was to meet in the afternoon, the &quot;Trottiera&quot; first rang for 15 minutes, immediately after Third Hour. After midday, the &quot;Marangona&quot; resounded (4 series of 50 strokes followed by 5 of 25). The &quot;Trottiera&quot; then rang continuously for a half hour as a second call for the members of the Great Council, signalling the need to quicken the pace. The name of the bell originated when horses were used in the city. The ringing of the &quot;Trottiera&quot; was therefore meant to signal the need to proceed at a trot. When the bell ceased, the doors of the council hall were closed and the session began. No latecomers were admitted. Whenever the Great Council convened in the morning, the &quot;Trottiera&quot; rang the previous evening for 15 minutes after the &quot;Marangona&quot; marked the end of the day at sunset. The &quot;Marangona&quot; was then rung in the morning, with the prescribed series of strokes, followed by the &quot;Trottiera&quot;.

The meetings of the Venetian Senate were announced by the &quot;Trottiera&quot;, which rang for 12 minutes. The &quot;Meza-terza&quot; followed and rang for 18 minutes. Because of this function, the &quot;Meza-terza&quot; was also known as the &quot;Pregadi&quot;, in reference to the early name of the Senate when members were &#x27;prayed&#x27; (&quot;pregadi&quot;) to attend.

====Holy days and events====
On solemnities and certain feast days, all the bells rang in &quot;plenum&quot;. The bells also rang in unison for three days, until three hours after sunset, to mark the election of the doge and the coronation of the pope. On these occasions, they were rapidly hammered. Two hundred lanterns were also arranged in four tiers at the height of the belfry in celebration.

To announce the death of the doge and for the funeral, the bells rang in unison (9 series, each series slowly over 12 minutes). For the death of the pope, the bells rang for three days after Third Hour (6 series, each series slowly over 12 minutes). The bells also marked the passing of cardinals and foreign ambassadors who had died in Venice, the dogaressa and sons of the doge, the patriarch and the canons of St Mark&#x27;s, the procurators of Saint Mark, and the Grand Chancellor (the highest ranking civil servant).

===Custodian===

The custodian of the bell tower was responsible for ringing the bells. Nominated for life by the procurators of Saint Mark &quot;de supra&quot;, he was often succeeded by his sons or, in one instance, by his widow. The salary varied over time and could include a combination of wages, lodgings in the tower, and the use, for sublet or retail activities, of one of the lean-to stalls at the base of the tower.

==Collapse and rebuilding (1902–1912)==
===Collapse===

When the lean-to stalls were removed from the sides of the bell tower in 1873–1874, the base was discovered to be in poor condition, but restoration was limited to repairing surface damage. Similarly, excavations in Saint Mark&#x27;s Square in 1885 raised concerns for the state of the foundation and the stability of the structure. Yet inspection reports by engineers and architects in 1892 and 1898 were reassuring that the tower was in no danger. Ensuing restoration was sporadic and primarily involved the substitution of weathered bricks.

In July 1902, work was underway to repair the roof of the loggetta. The girder supporting the roof where it rested against the tower was removed by cutting a large fissure, roughly in height and in depth, at the base of the tower. On 7 July, it was observed that the shaft of the tower trembled as workmen hammered the new girder into place. Glass tell-tales were inserted into crevices in order to monitor the shifting of the tower. Several of these were found broken the next day.

By 12 July, a large crack had formed on the northern side of the tower, running almost the entire height of the brick shaft. More accurate plaster tell-tales were inserted into the crevices. Although a technical commission was immediately formed, it determined that there was no threat to the structure. Nevertheless, wooden barricades were erected to keep onlookers at a safe distance as pieces of mortar began to break off from the widening gap and fall to the square below. Access to the tower was prohibited, and only the bell signalling the beginning and end of the work day was to be rung in order to limit vibrations. The following day, Sunday, the customary band in Saint Mark&#x27;s Square was cancelled for the same reason.

The next morning, Monday 14 July, the latest tell-tales were all discovered broken; the maximum crack that had developed since the preceding day was . At 09:30 the square was ordered evacuated. Stones began to fall at 9:47, and at 9:53 the entire bell tower collapsed. Subsequent investigations determined that the immediate cause of the disaster was the collapse of the access ramps located between the inner and outer shafts of the tower. Beginning at the upper levels, these fell one by one atop the others. Without their support, the outer shaft then caved in against the inner shaft. Because the tower collapsed vertically and due to the tower&#x27;s isolated position, the resulting damage was relatively limited. Apart from the loggetta, which was completely demolished, only a corner of the historical building of the Marciana Library was destroyed. The basilica itself was unharmed, although the &quot;pietra del bando&quot;, a large porphyry column from which laws were read, was damaged. The sole fatality was the custodian&#x27;s cat. That same evening, the communal council convened in an emergency session and voted unanimously to rebuild the bell tower exactly as it had been before the collapse. The council also approved an initial 500,000 lire for the reconstruction. The province of Venice followed with 200,000 lire on 22 July. Although a few detractors of the reconstruction, including the editorialist of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and Maurice Barrès, claimed that the square was more beautiful without the tower and that any replica would have no historical value, &quot;dov’era e com’era&quot; (&quot;where it was and how it was&quot;) was the prevailing sentiment.

===Rebuilding===

In addition to the sums appropriated by the commune and the province, a personal donation arrived from King Victor Emmanuel III and the queen mother (100,000 lire). This was followed by contributions from other Italian communes and provinces as well as private citizens. Throughout the world, fund raising began, spearheaded by international newspapers. The German scaffolding specialist Georg Leib of Munich donated the scaffolding on 22 July 1902.

In autumn 1902, work began on clearing the site. The fragments of the loggetta, including columns, reliefs, capitals, and the bronze statues, were carefully removed, inventoried, and transferred to the courtyard of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. Bricks that could be used for other construction projects were salvaged, whereas the rubble of no use was transported on barges to the open Adriatic where it was dumped. By spring 1903, the site had been cleared of debris, and the remaining stub of the old tower was torn down and the material removed. The pilings of the medieval foundation were inspected and found to be in good condition, requiring only moderate reinforcement.

The ceremony to mark the commencement of the actual reconstruction took place on 25 April 1903, St Mark&#x27;s feast day, with the blessing by the patriarch of Venice Giuseppe Sarto, later Pope Pius X, and the laying of the cornerstone by Prince Vittorio Emanuele, the count of Turin, as the king&#x27;s representative. For the first two years, work consisted in preparing the foundation which was extended outward by on all sides. This was accomplished by driving in 3076 larch piles, roughly in length and in diameter. Eight layers of Istrian stone blocks were then placed on top to create the new foundation. This was completed in October 1905. The first of the 1,203,000 bricks used for the new tower was laid in a second ceremony on 1 April 1906. To facilitate construction, a mobile scaffold was conceived. It surrounded the tower on all sides and was raised as work progressed by extending the braces.

With respect to the original tower, structural changes were made to provide for greater stability and decrease the overall weight. The two shafts, one inside the other, were previously independent of each other. The outer shell alone bore the entire weight of the belfry and spire; the inner shaft only partially supported the series of ramps and steps. With the new design, the two shafts were tied together by means of reinforced concrete beams which also support the weight of the ramps, rebuilt in concrete rather than masonry. In addition, the stone support of the spire was replaced with reinforced concrete, and the weight was distributed on both the inner and outer shafts of the tower.

The tower itself was completed on 3 October 1908. It was then in height. The following year work began on the belfry and the year after on the attic. The allegorical figures of Venice as Justice on the eastern and western sides were reassembled from the fragments that had been recovered from the ruins and were restored. The twin effigies of the winged lion of Saint Mark located on the remaining sides of the attic had already been chiselled away and irreparably damaged after the fall of the Venetian Republic at the time of the first French occupation (May 1797 – January 1798). They were completely remade.

Work began on the spire in 1911 and lasted until 5 March 1912 when the restored statue of the archangel Gabriel was hoisted to the summit. The new campanile was inaugurated on 25 April 1912, on the occasion of St Mark&#x27;s feast day, exactly 1000 years after the foundations of the original building had allegedly been laid.

===New bells===

Of the five bells cast by Domenico Canciani Dalla Venezia in 1820, only the largest, the &quot;Marangona&quot;, survived the collapse.

On 14 July 1902, Pope Pius X, patriarch of Venice at the time of the collapse, announced his intention to personally finance the recasting of the four bells as a gift to the city. For the purpose, a foundry was activated near the Church of Sant&#x27;Elena, on the homonymous island. The work was carried out under the supervision of the directors of the choirs of St Mark&#x27;s and St Anthony&#x27;s in Padua, the director of the Milan Conservatory, and the owner of the of Milan. The fragments of the four bells were first assembled, and moulds were made to ensure the same sizes and shapes. The original bronze was then remelted, and the new &quot;Maleficio&quot;, &quot;Trottiera&quot;, &quot;Meza terza&quot;, and &quot;Nona&quot; were cast on 24 April 1909, the vigil of St Mark&#x27;s Feast. After two months, the bells were tuned to harmonize with the &quot;Marangona&quot; before being transported to Saint Mark&#x27;s Square for storage. They were formally blessed by Cardinal Aristide Cavallari, patriarch of Venice, on 15 June 1910 in a ceremony with Prince Luigi Amedeo in attendance, prior to being raised to the new belfry on 22 June.

To ring the new bells, the simple rope and lever system, previously used to swing the wooden headstock, was replaced with a grooved wheel around which the rope is wrapped. This was done to minimize the vibrations whenever the bells are rung and hence the risk of damage to the tower.
==Elevator==
In 1892, it was first proposed that an elevator be installed in the bell tower. But concerns over the stability of the structure were voiced by the Regional Office for the Preservation of Veneto Monuments (&quot;Ufficio Regionale per la Conservazione dei Monumenti del Veneto&quot;). Although a special commission was nominated and concluded that the concerns were unfounded, the project was abandoned.

At the time of the reconstruction, an elevator was used to raise the new bells to the level of the belfry, but it was only temporary. Finally, in 1962, a permanent elevator was installed. Located within the inner shaft, it takes 30 seconds to reach the belfry from the ground level.

==Restoration work (2007–2013)==
At the time of the reconstruction, the original foundation was extended from approximately to with the objective of distributing the weight of the bell tower on a larger base and reducing the load from to per . This was done by driving additional piles into the clay. Three layers of oak planks were then laid on top of the piles followed by multiple layers of Istrian stone blocks. However, the old and the new foundations were not successfully fused into a unified whole, and they began to subside at different rates. As a result, cracks in the new tower were already visible in 1914 and multiplied over time. A monitoring system, installed in 1995, revealed that the tower was leaning by .

Beginning in 2007, the Magistrato alle Acque, responsible for public works, reinforced the foundation, adopting a system used to consolidate the façade of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. This involved placing four titanium tension cables, in diameter, around the perimeter of the stone foundation. Two of the cables, placed apart within a single protective polyethylene tube, are located below the surface of the square and are anchored at the four corners of the foundation by titanium pillars. Two more cables are located at a depth of and are held by granite blocks. These cables are monitored and can be tightened as necessary. The project, initially projected to last two and half years, was completed after five years in April 2013.

==Influence==
The campanile inspired the designs of other towers worldwide, especially in the areas belonging to the former Republic of Venice. Similar bell towers, albeit smaller, exist at the Church of San Rocco in Dolo, Italy, at the Church of San Giorgio in Piran, Slovenia, and at the Church of Sant&#x27;Eufemia in Rovinj, Croatia.
Other towers inspired by St Mark&#x27;s campanile, particularly in the aftermath of the collapse of the original tower, include:
* the mill chimney of India Mill (1867) in Darwen, Lancashire, UK
* the Sretenskaya church (1892) in Bogucharovo, Tula region, Russia
* the right-hand bell-tower of St. John Gualbert (1895) in Johnstown, Pennsylvania
* the clock tower at King Street Station (1904–1906) in Seattle, Washington
* the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower (1905–1909) in New York City
* the Daniels &amp; Fisher Tower (1910) in Denver, Colorado
* 14 Wall Street (1910–1912) in New York City
* the Rathaus (Town Hall) (1911) in Kiel, Germany
* the Custom House Tower (1913–1915) in Boston, Massachusetts
* the Sather Tower (1914) on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley
* North Toronto Station (1916) in Toronto, Canada
* Brisbane City Hall (1920–1930) in Brisbane, Australia
* the Campanile (1922–1924) in Port Elizabeth, South Africa
*the Tribune Tower (1923–1924) in Oakland, California
* the Venetian Towers (1927–1929) in Barcelona, Spain
* the tower at Jones Beach State Park (1930), Long Island, New York
*the water tower of the former Trencherfield Mill in Wigan, Greater Manchester, UK

As symbols of Venice, replicas of the campanile also exist at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada and at its sister resort The Venetian Macao in Macao; at the Italy Pavilion at Epcot, a theme park at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; and at the Venice Grand Canal Mall in Taguig, Philippines.

<text>Aextoxicon is a genus of dioecious trees native to southern Chile and Argentina. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Aextoxicaceae, and is itself represented by the olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum). It is a large evergreen tree native to the forests of the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests of the Pacific coast of southern Chile, where it forms is a canopy tree in the broadleaf forests. It can reach 15 m tall.

The APG system (1998) and the APG II system (2003) left the family Aextoxicaceae unplaced in the core eudicots. It has since been included in the order Berberidopsidales. The genus was formerly often included in the family Euphorbiaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Aextoxicon punctatum&quot; is a large tree often found in the canopy or emergent. It has opposite leaves with dark green coloration on the top and lighter green below, and is covered in rusty peltate scales. The flowers are actinomorphic and unisexual, in hanging racemes. The flowers have 5 sepals and 5 petals. Male flowers have 5 stamens opposite the sepals while female flowers have two carpels that fuse to form a bilocular ovary. The fruit is a single seeded drupe that resembles an olive, thus giving the plant its common name.
==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Aextoxicon punctatum&quot; is found in Chile, usually in damp places from the Bosque de Fray Jorge National Park southwards to the Chiloé Archipelago, also in the Valdivian forest and Magellanic forests of the southern Pacific coast. In Argentina it is present in the middle reaches of the Rio Negro valley, being invasive on the island of Choele Choel, and it is common in the Lago Puelo National Park, Chubut.

==Uses==
The tree is used for its high-quality timber.

== History ==

=== Japan ===
In 1919, Riichi Ezaki created a caramel candy product containing glycogen extracted from oysters. The caramel candy product was named &quot;Glico,&quot; a shortening of the word glycogen. The sales copy for this product was &quot;300 Meters in a Single Piece,&quot; and a running man was painted on the package. On February 11, 1922, Riichi started selling Glico products at the Mitsukoshi Osaka branch.

Later, in 1922, Riichi established a company, Ezaki Glico Co., Ltd. Its Osaka and Tokyo factories were destroyed during World War II, and they were reopened in 1951. Popular products like Pretz and Pocky were introduced in 1963 and 1966, respectively.

In 1984, the Glico Morinaga case, a series of criminal incidents targeting Japanese major food manufacturers, occurred. Ezaki Glico and other victims were targeted by a group known as &quot;The Monster with 21 Faces.&quot; The group claimed that $21 million ($2.26 billion yen) worth of sweets was laced with potassium cyanide soda, while Katsuhisa Ezaki(), president and CEO, was kidnapped but escaped by himself. Ezaki Glico was blackmailed and its office was burned by the criminals.

Ezaki Glico&#x27;s large LED sign located above Dōtonbori in Osaka has been a landmark of the city since its initial construction in 1935. It bears the Glico running man on a blue race track, as well as some of Osaka&#x27;s other landmarks in the background.

<text>Silas Kopf (born 1949) is an American furniture maker specializing in the art of marquetry. Kopf graduated from Princeton University in 1972 with a degree in architecture and soon began designing and making furniture. In 1988, he received a Craftsman&#x27;s Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and used the opportunity to study traditional marquetry technique at the École Boulle, an institute of interior architecture and design, in Paris. His major projects include several pianos commissioned by Steinway &amp; Sons and benches, desks, and cabinets for private collections and museums. His designs frequently incorporate floral depictions, other images from nature, and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; concepts. He first became interested in marquetry because he hoped for an alternative, less consumerist lifestyle.

Kopf was named Master of the Medium by the James Renwick Alliance of the Smithsonian Institution for 2015. This biennial award recognizes American craftspeople in the fields of wood, ceramics, glass, metal, and fiber.

Since 1978, he has worked in Easthampton, Massachusetts, where he continues to build and design. He has an assistant, Tom Coughlin, who also designs and builds guitars.

<text>836 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm.

==History==
836 Naval Air Squadron officially formed for the first time at Palisadoes, Jamaica, in March 1942 as a torpedo bomber reconnaissance squadron flying the Fairey Swordfish. It operated from HMS &quot;Buzzard&quot; at Palisadoes, Jamaica, in spring 1942, and it subsequently embarked on the Woolworth carrier in June 1942 for the UK, where it joined RAF Coastal Command in January 1943 for operations in the English Channel from RAF Thorney Island. 836 returned aboard HMS &quot;Biter&quot; to be re-formed to provide personnel and aircraft for the MAC ships, 836 was later based at Maydown, known as HMS &quot;Shrike&quot;, in Northern Ireland, not far from Lough Foyle, and commanded by Acting Lieutenant Commander Ransford Slater. He took command in July 1942 and worked up the squadron at Thorney Island until March 1943 when it was based at Machrihanish.

===Lieutenant Commander Slater===
Slater had personally led the squadron&#x27;s &#x27;A&#x27; flight in the first attachment to MV &quot;Empire MacAlpine&quot; in April 1943 and he was the only regular Royal Navy officer in the unit, all others being wartime RNVR. Slater had recognised from the outset that successful operations required the aircrew and ship&#x27;s crew to work together as a team. That was potentially a problem since the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy had widely differing working practices and traditions.

&quot;During the weeks of training, Slater was in his element. His leadership was evident in every aspect. His skill in unlocking the secrets of how to land on a floating postage-stamp were passed on to his pilots, while, at the same time, he made the team feel that their contribution to the success of the enterprise was vital..&quot;

One thing he arranged was that the air party on the ships signed ships articles and hence placed themselves under the orders of the Ship&#x27;s Master. For this they were supposed to receive one shilling per month and a bottle of beer per day. They got the beer – seven bottles every Sunday. It also entitled them to wear the small silver &#x27;MN&#x27; lapel badge on their uniforms, which caused not a little upset with more traditional senior RN officers. Another of Slater&#x27;s rules for the squadron was that flight commanders must have completed a full round trip under another flight commander before being eligible to take over.

The squadron operated the Fairey Swordfish Mark II and they were painted all white (apparently the best camouflage for daylight flight over water). Some flights got carried away and replaced the &quot;Royal Navy&quot; legend on the rear fuselage with &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; – to the consternation of some observers. With a flight for each of 19 ships, plus a few spare flights for training and relief, the squadron eventually grew to a strength of 91 aircraft, certainly a Fleet Air Arm record and probably a world one. Slater was awarded the military OBE for his efforts, particularly for landing on a MAC ship carrying 2 depth charges after his arrester hook had been torn away. He was killed by flying into powerlines near Derry on 28 June 1944.

Some of the crews and aircraft were lent to 816 Naval Air Squadron during the middle of 1944. 816 NAS were based at Perranporth Airfield and carried out anti-submarine patrols under the control of Coastal Command. The loan was due to the expected increase of U-boat activity in the Channel area as a result of the D-Day landings.

After VE-Day, 836 squadron was disbanded in July 1945.

<doc id="985362" wikidata="Q779165" url="?curid=985362" title="Life with Lucy">
<text>Life with Lucy is an American sitcom starring Lucille Ball. Created by Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, the series aired for one season on ABC from September 20 to November 15, 1986. It is the only Lucille Ball sitcom to not air on CBS.

Developed amidst an industry-wide interest in comeback vehicles, ABC and producer Aaron Spelling coaxed Ball out of retirement for a new series. Unlike Ball&#x27;s previous sitcoms, &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; was a failure in the ratings and poorly received by critics and viewers alike. Only eight out of the 13 episodes produced were aired before ABC cancelled the series. Its cancellation devastated her. This was the last television series or film she starred in before her death in 1989.

==Premise==
Ball plays a recently widowed grandmother who has inherited her husband Sam&#x27;s half interest in a hardware store in South Pasadena, California, the other half being owned by his business partner, widower Curtis McGibbon (played by Gale Gordon). Lucy&#x27;s character insists on &quot;helping&quot; in the store, even though when her husband was alive, she had taken no part in the business and hence knows nothing about it. The unlikely partners are also in-laws, her daughter Margo being married to his son Ted. And all of them, along with their young grandchildren Becky and Kevin, live together.

==Episodes==
==Production==
During the 1984–1985 television season, NBC had experienced a huge success with its Bill Cosby comeback vehicle &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, following it up the next year with &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, which likewise revitalized the careers of Bea Arthur and Betty White. ABC, looking to stage a similar resurgence for an older sitcom star and to boost Saturday night ratings, approached 75-year-old, five-time Emmy award winner and cultural icon Lucille Ball. Producer Aaron Spelling had been in talks with Ball and her second husband Gary Morton since 1979 about possibly doing another series; the popular success of her dramatic turn in the television film &quot;Stone Pillow&quot; had proved she was still popular with audiences. Ball was initially hesitant about returning to television, stating that she did not believe she could top the 25-year run of success she had had with &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;. Her longtime co-star Vivian Vance had died in 1979, and Gale Gordon was retired in Palm Springs. However, Ball eventually agreed, conceding she had missed having a regular project to work on daily.

Ball&#x27;s only conditions working on the series were that she be reunited with Gordon, and longtime writers Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Pugh. Although ABC had offered Ball the writers from the critical and ratings hit &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and she was open to other writers on the series, Ball was insistent that Carroll and Pugh supervise the writing. Both had worked for Ball since her 1948 radio show &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, and had been writers on all of her television series, plus several of her specials; more recently, they had worked on &quot;Alice&quot;. Gordon was coaxed out of retirement with the promise of a full season&#x27;s pay for all 22 episodes, regardless of whether the show was picked up for such. According to cast and crew members, the then 80-year-old Gordon never once flubbed a line on the set during the 13-episode duration. Ball also called in crew members who had worked for her since the days of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. The most notable was sound man Cam McCulloch, who joined the crew during &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;’s third season in 1954. However, by 1986, McCulloch was 77 years old and quite hard of hearing, requiring the use of two hearing aids; he was still working actively in Hollywood at the time, mixing audio for &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Square Pegs&quot; and select episodes of &quot;Newhart&quot;. Ball was reportedly paid $100,000 an episode. Ball’s husband Gary Morton, carrying the title of executive producer, negotiated for $150,000 per episode.

The series was initially developed by Carroll and Pugh to resemble &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and Ball had offered to do something different from her previous projects. However, ABC wanted the series in the vein of Ball&#x27;s previous series. According to a former assistant of Morton, &quot;there was a lot of politicking going on between the &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; staff, the Spelling staff, and ABC.&quot;

Ball&#x27;s character&#x27;s surname, Barker, continued her tradition of using surnames containing the letters &quot;ar&quot; (as in Ricardo, Carmichael and Carter on Ball&#x27;s previous sitcoms) in tribute to her ex-husband Desi Arnaz.

The show&#x27;s theme song was performed by Eydie Gormé. An alternative theme was written by Ball&#x27;s daughter, Lucie Arnaz with Cy Coleman, but was not used. 

===Cancellation===
Fourteen episodes were written, thirteen filmed, but only eight aired. The final to air, &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot;, was the twelfth episode filmed and featured Audrey Meadows as Lucy&#x27;s sister. Meadows was offered to be cast as a regular to give the show a new direction and Ball&#x27;s character a comic foil and partner, similar to the role of Vivian Vance in Ball&#x27;s previous series. (This was the only Ball sitcom in which Vance, who had died in 1979, never appeared). However, Ball and Meadows did not get along on the set, and Meadows turned down the offer. On November 17, the day of the taping the final episode, ABC informed Spelling and Morton that they were not ordering a full season, thus cancelling the series. Morton decided not to reveal the news to Ball until after the taping had ended.

Since only 13 episodes were produced, it was not possible for the series to go into heavy rerun rotation like &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Nevertheless, it aired on Nick at Nite as part of a Lucille Ball-themed marathon in 1996. Episodes can also be found at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Beverly Hills, California.

Ball was devastated by the failure of the show, and she never again attempted another series or feature film; her subsequent interviews and other TV appearances were infrequent. Her last public appearance was as a presenter at the 1989 Academy Awards, where she and fellow presenter Bob Hope were given a standing ovation. She died a month later, in April 1989. In a 1999 interview with the Archive of American Television, Aaron Spelling attributed the failure of the show to his decision to allow Ball to do the same type of shows she had done in the past. Spelling said that at her age, the audience were more worried for her safety than laughing at her pratfalls. Spelling said this experience had a lot to do with his rarely producing sitcoms.

In July 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; the 26th worst TV series of all time, stating that it was &quot;without a doubt, the saddest entry in [its] list of bad TV shows of all time&quot;. In his book &quot;What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History&quot;, author David Hofstede ranked the series at No. 21 on the list.

===Ratings===
&quot;Life with Lucy&quot;″s premiere episode on September 20 made the Nielsen&#x27;s Top 25 (#23 for the week) for its week; however, subsequent episodes dropped steadily in viewership; &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; went against NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; in the same Saturday night lead off timeslot and never gained ground against it. It ranked only 73rd out of 79 shows for the season (the seventh lowest rated show on TV for the season), with a 9.0/16 rating/share.

==Home media==
In September 2018, Time-Life released a DVD, &quot;Lucy: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, that included 4 episodes of &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; (which had never before been released to home media), as well as 32 episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, two episodes of &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, 24 episodes of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, and 14 episodes of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, plus a wide variety of bonus features.

On July 26, 2019, CBS/Paramount announced the release of all thirteen episodes on a separate &quot;Life with Lucy - The Complete Series&quot; DVD set, including the final five episodes that were produced but never aired. The set was released on October 8, 2019.

In Australia, &quot;Life With Lucy - The Complete Series&quot; was released on April 1, 2020 and distributed by Shock Entertainment.

<text>A vision statement is a high-level, inspirational statement of an idealistic emotional future of a company or group. Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the people the organization interacts with.

Vision statements may fill the following functions for a company:
* Serve as foundations for a broader strategic plan.
* Motivate existing employees and attract potential employees by clearly categorizing the company&#x27;s goals and attracting like-minded individuals.
* Focus company efforts and facilitate the creation of core competencies by directing the company to only focus on strategic opportunities that advance the company&#x27;s vision.
* Help companies differentiate from competitors.

== Characteristics ==
A consensus does not exist on the characteristics of a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; vision statement. Commonly cited traits include:
* concise: able to be easily remembered and repeated
* clear: defines a prime goal
* time horizon: defines a time horizon
* future-oriented: describes where the company is going rather than the current state
* stable: offers a long-term perspective and is unlikely to be impacted by market or technology changes
* challenging: not something that can be easily met and discarded
* abstract: general enough to encompass all of the organization&#x27;s interests and strategic direction
* inspiring: motivates employees and is something that employees view as desirable

<text>Sir Geoffrey John Mulgan CBE (born 1961) is Professor of Collective Intelligence, Public Policy and Social Innovation at University College London (UCL). From 2011 to 2019 he was chief executive of the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and visiting professor at University College London, the London School of Economics, and the University of Melbourne.

== Education ==
Mulgan obtained a first-class degree from Balliol College, Oxford and a PhD in telecommunications from the University of Westminster. He was also a fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and trained as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. 

== Career ==
Mulgan worked for a spell in the 1980s as a van driver for the &quot;Labour-supporting collective of musicians and comedians known as Red Wedge&quot;, opting ultimately for a career in local government and academia in the UK as well as writing on social and political issues in various newspapers and magazines in the 1990s, including &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He also worked as a reporter for BBC television and radio.

In January 2020, he was appointed as Professor of Collective Intelligence, Public Policy and Social Innovation at University College London, to lead research into collective intelligence. Also in 2020, he joined the Nordic think tank Demos Helsinki as a fellow.

Earlier roles include:
*Chief executive of Nesta, an innovation foundation (2011 to 2019). He led the organisation&#x27;s transition from the public sector to an independent charitable foundation.
*CEO of the Young Foundation, based in London (until 2011)
*Director of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Strategy Unit (and before that Director of the Performance and Innovation Unit)
*Director of Policy at 10 Downing Street under prime minister Tony Blair
*Co-founder and director of the London-based think tank Demos (from 1993 to 1998)
*Chief adviser to Gordon Brown MP in the early 1990s
He has founded or co-founded many organisations, including: Demos, the Young Foundation, the Social Innovation Exchange (SIX), Uprising, Studio Schools Trust, Action for Happiness, the Alliance for Useful Evidence, States of Change, The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, Maslaha and Nesta Italia. He is a founding editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Collective Intelligence&quot;, published by Sage and ACM.

He has been chair of various organisations including the Social Innovation Exchange; Involve; Nesta Italia; and the Studio Schools Trust. He was co-chair of the London LEP Digital, Science, Technology and Arts group under then London Mayor Boris Johnson. He has been a board member of Big Society Capital and a trustee of charities including Action for Happiness; the Photographers&#x27; Gallery; Reimagine Europa; Luton Culture Trust; the Design Council, the Work Foundation, Crime Concern, and Political Quarterly, and a member of various committees for bodies including the European Commission, World Economic Forum, OECD, SITRA and the Academy of Medical Sciences.

In 2007–2008 Mulgan was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence, advising South Australian Premier Mike Rann on social innovation and social inclusion policies. As a result of Mulgan&#x27;s recommendations, the Rann Government established The Australian Centre for Social Innovation. From 2016 to 2019, Mulgan was a senior visiting scholar at the Ash Center in the Kennedy School at Harvard University. From 2019 to 2022 he was a World Economic Forum Schwab Fellow.

Mulgan is profiled in two books: &quot;The New Alchemists&quot; (1999, by Charles Handy), and &quot;Visionaries&quot; (2001, by Jay Walljasper). He was profiled by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in January 2024, prompted by evidence that when in government he had tried to cancel the Horizon Post Office software which later caused a series of miscarriages of justice and a major scandal.

== Works ==
Mulgan has written a number of books, including &quot;Communication and Control: Networks and the New Economies of Communication&quot; (1991), &quot;Politics in an Anti-Political Age&quot; (1994), &quot;Connexity&quot; (1997), &quot;Good and Bad Power: the Ideals and Betrayals of Government&quot; (Penguin, 2006), &quot;The Art of Public Strategy&quot; (2009), &quot;The Locust and the Bee&quot; (Princeton, 2013), &quot;Big Mind: how collective intelligence can change our world&quot; (Princeton, 2017); &quot;Social innovation: how societies find the power to change&quot; (Policy Press, 2019); &quot;Another World is Possible: how to reignite social and political imagination&quot; (Hurst/Oxford University Press, 2022); and &quot;When Science Meets Power&quot;&#x27; (Polity Press, 2024). His books have been translated into many languages.

He has written numerous reports and pamphlets for Demos, the Young Foundation, Nesta, and Demos Helsinki. He has lectured and advised several governments on policy and strategy, and given TED talks on the global economy, education, and happiness.

The lake, from which the village derives its name, is an oxbow lake near the Chippewa River between Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls. Here, in 1843, the McCann brothers joined with Jeremiah C.

Later, after several changes of ownership and many improvements, this mill was acquired by the Badger State Lumber Company and became known as Badger Mills. Its operations were discontinued in the 1890s due to a shortage of logs.

In an open effort to prevent further annexation and utility encroachment by the cities of Chippewa Falls from the northeast and Eau Claire from the southwest, the village was incorporated by referendum from a large portion of the Town of Hallie on February 28, 2003.

<text> () is a Finnish Christmas figure. The name literally means or in Finnish; the word comes from the Old Swedish word &quot;bukker&quot;, a cognate of English &quot;&quot;, meaning . An old Nordic folk tradition, the figure is now often conflated with Santa Claus.

==Origins and description==
The Finnish Father Christmas (literally &quot;Christmas goat&quot;) appears connected with the Scandinavian &quot;julebukk&quot;, not the &quot;Yule goat&quot; as such, but rather the ritual theatrics of men dressed up in costume rowdily going around villages (see Julebukking). Thus an older dictionary glosses Finnish (lit. &quot;Yule&#x27;s old man&quot;) as Swedish &quot;julebock&quot;.

Today, in some parts of Finland, the folk custom persists of persons performing in goat costume in return for leftover Christmas food. The performer traditionally is an older man, who is called a &quot;.

In Finland in its modern incarnation, inspired by the international Santa Claus figure, he usually wears warm red robbers, but with a broad band of blue near the fur, uses a walking stick, and travels in a sleigh pulled by a number of reindeer (which do not fly, unlike Santa Claus&#x27; team). In Lapland, he rides in a , rather than a sleigh. The popular holiday song &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, in its Finnish translation, , has led to Rudolph&#x27;s general acceptance in Finland as Joulupukki&#x27;s lead reindeer. Joulupukki is often mentioned as having a wife, (), but tradition says little of her.

==Joulupukki&#x27;s other side==

Popular radio programs from the year 1927 onwards probably had great influence in reformatting the concept with the Santa-like costume, reindeer and Korvatunturi as his dwelling place. Because there really are reindeer in Finland, and Finns live up North, the popular American story took root in Finland very quickly.

Finland&#x27;s Joulupukki receives over 500,000 letters from over 200 countries every year. Most letters come from Poland, Italy, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.

Joulupukki is a prominent character in &quot;Rare Exports&quot;, a film based on the award-winning shorts by Jalmari Helander.

<text>Piazzetta dei Leoncini is a city square in Venice, Italy. The square is located on the north side of the St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, near the Palazzo Patriarcale and San Basso. The square is known for its lion statuary in marble of Cottanello, made by the sculptor Giovanni Bonazza in 1722. Also on the square, in an alcove of the Basilica itself, is the sarcophagus of Daniele Manin, the president of the brief independent Republic of San Marco, established during a rebellion in 1848 against Habsburg rule.

<text>The binary GCD algorithm, also known as Stein&#x27;s algorithm or the binary Euclidean algorithm, is an algorithm that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two nonnegative integers. Stein&#x27;s algorithm uses simpler arithmetic operations than the conventional Euclidean algorithm; it replaces division with arithmetic shifts, comparisons, and subtraction.

Although the algorithm in its contemporary form was first published by the physicist and programmer Josef Stein in 1967, it was known by the 2nd century BCE, in ancient China.

==Algorithm==

The algorithm finds the GCD of two nonnegative numbers formula_1 and formula_2 by repeatedly applying these identities:

# formula_3: everything divides zero, and formula_1 is the largest number that divides formula_1.
# formula_6: formula_7 is a common divisor.
# formula_8 if formula_1 is odd: formula_7 is then not a common divisor.
# formula_11 if formula_12 odd and formula_13.

As GCD is commutative (formula_14), those identities still apply if the operands are swapped: formula_15, formula_16 if formula_2 is odd, etc.

==Implementation==

While the above description of the algorithm is mathematically correct, performant software implementations typically differ from it in a few notable ways:
* eschewing trial division by formula_7 in favour of a single bitshift and the count trailing zeros primitive; this is functionally equivalent to repeatedly applying identity 3, but much faster;
* expressing the algorithm iteratively rather than recursively: the resulting implementation can be laid out to avoid repeated work, invoking identity 2 at the start and maintaining as invariant that both numbers are odd upon entering the loop, which only needs to implement identities 3 and 4;
* making the loop&#x27;s body branch-free except for its exit condition (formula_19): in the example below, the exchange of formula_1 and formula_2 (ensuring formula_13) compiles down to conditional moves; hard-to-predict branches can have a large, negative impact on performance.

The following is an implementation of the algorithm in Rust exemplifying those differences, adapted from &quot;uutils&quot;:

use std::cmp::min;
use std::mem::swap;

pub fn gcd(mut u: u64, mut v: u64) -&gt; u64 {
 // Base cases: gcd(n, 0) = gcd(0, n) = n
 if u == 0 {
 return v;
 } else if v == 0 {
 return u;

 // Using identities 2 and 3:
 // gcd(2ⁱ u, 2ʲ v) = 2ᵏ gcd(u, v) with u, v odd and k = min(i, j)
 // 2ᵏ is the greatest power of two that divides both 2ⁱ u and 2ʲ v
 let i = u.trailing_zeros(); u »= i;
 let j = v.trailing_zeros(); v »= j;
 let k = min(i, j);

 loop {
 // u and v are odd at the start of the loop
 debug_assert!(u % 2 == 1, &quot;u = {} should be odd&quot;, u);
 debug_assert!(v % 2 == 1, &quot;v = {} should be odd&quot;, v);

 // Swap if necessary so u ≤ v
 if u &gt; v {
 swap(&amp;mut u, &amp;mut v);

 // Identity 4: gcd(u, v) = gcd(u, v-u) as u ≤ v and u, v are both odd 
 v -= u;
 // v is now even

 if v == 0 {
 // Identity 1: gcd(u, 0) = u
 // The shift by k is necessary to add back the 2ᵏ factor that was removed before the loop
 return u « k;

 // Identity 3: gcd(u, 2ʲ v) = gcd(u, v) as u is odd
 v »= v.trailing_zeros();
}
Note: The implementation above accepts &quot;unsigned&quot; (non-negative) integers; given that formula_23, the signed case can be handled as follows:

/// Computes the GCD of two signed 64-bit integers
/// The result is unsigned and not always representable as i64: gcd(i64::MIN, i64::MIN) == 1 « 63
pub fn signed_gcd(u: i64, v: i64) -&gt; u64 {
 gcd(u.unsigned_abs(), v.unsigned_abs())


==Complexity==
Asymptotically, the algorithm requires formula_24 steps, where formula_25 is the number of bits in the larger of the two numbers, as every two steps reduce at least one of the operands by at least a factor of formula_7. Each step involves only a few arithmetic operations (formula_27 with a small constant); when working with word-sized numbers, each arithmetic operation translates to a single machine operation, so the number of machine operations is on the order of formula_25, i.e. formula_29.

For arbitrarily large numbers, the asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is formula_30, as each arithmetic operation (subtract and shift) involves a linear number of machine operations (one per word in the numbers&#x27; binary representation).
If the numbers can be represented in the machine&#x27;s memory, &quot;i.e.&quot; each number&#x27;s &quot;size&quot; can be represented by a single machine word, this bound is reduced to:
formula_31

This is the same as for the Euclidean algorithm, though a more precise analysis by Akhavi and Vallée proved that binary GCD uses about 60% fewer bit operations.

==Extensions==

The binary GCD algorithm can be extended in several ways, either to output additional information, deal with arbitrarily large integers more efficiently, or to compute GCDs in domains other than the integers.

The &quot;extended binary GCD&quot; algorithm, analogous to the extended Euclidean algorithm, fits in the first kind of extension, as it provides the Bézout coefficients in addition to the GCD: integers formula_32 and formula_33 such that formula_34.

In the case of large integers, the best asymptotic complexity is formula_35, with formula_36 the cost of formula_25-bit multiplication; this is near-linear and vastly smaller than the binary GCD algorithm&#x27;s formula_30, though concrete implementations only outperform older algorithms for numbers larger than about 64 kilobits (&quot;i.e.&quot; greater than 8×1019265). This is achieved by extending the binary GCD algorithm using ideas from the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication. 

The binary GCD algorithm has also been extended to domains other than natural numbers, such as Gaussian integers, Eisenstein integers, quadratic rings, and integer rings of number fields.

==Historical description==
An algorithm for computing the GCD of two numbers was known in ancient China, under the Han dynasty, as a method to reduce fractions:

The phrase &quot;if possible halve it&quot; is ambiguous,
* if this applies when &quot;either&quot; of the numbers become even, the algorithm is the binary GCD algorithm;
* if this only applies when &quot;both&quot; numbers are even, the algorithm is similar to the Euclidean algorithm.

Though the rural context to which he was born offered him little in the way of formal education, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s zeal for self-study earnt him proficiency in Burushaski, Urdu, Arabic and Classical Persian, which allowed him to study manuscripts collected by his father and other local scholars, including, among others, Khusraw&#x27;s &quot;Wajh-i Din&quot; (which he later translated into Urdu), &quot;Jami&#x27; al-Hikmatayn&quot; and &quot;Zad al-Musafirin&quot;, and Ja&#x27;far b. Mansur&#x27;s &quot;Sara&#x27;ir wa-Asrar al-Nutaqa&quot; - some of the most complex in their genre. As a result, he became well-versed in classical Isma&#x27;ili Neoplatonic philosophy and hermeneutics before having even reached the end of puberty. This early phase of inquisition also saw him take to poetry, with Sa&#x27;di&#x27;s &quot;Bustan&quot;, &quot;Gulistan&quot; and &quot;Karima&quot;, as well as Hafiz-i Shirazi&#x27;s &quot;Divan&quot; and Rumi&#x27;s &quot;Kulliyat-i Shams&quot; included in his father&#x27;s collection of manuscripts.

During this early phase, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai was forced to take up shepherding in order to sustain his family. He would later recall how he used to carry his herding-stick in one hand, and the Qur&#x27;an in the other, which he studied with great avidity, and began to develop original theological and hermeneutical positions over its injunctions.

== Military life ==
&#x27;Allamah Hunzai was recruited into the Gilgit Scouts on 8 April 1939, aged 21. He recalls having become &quot;habituated&quot; to seeking knowledge as a result of nurturing the zeal he possessed therefor during his days as a shepherd, and he thus continued to study books on classical philosophy and poetry during his leisure time.

It was during his service in the Gilgit Scouts that &#x27;Allamah Hunzai began to compose poetry, beginning with his mother-tongue, Burushaski (for more on &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s poetry, see the section entitled &#x27;Poetry&#x27;). Prior to him, however, Burushaski had been a broken, oral tongue, and there did not exist a script with which to write in the language. As one of the world&#x27;s 129 language isolates, Burushaski possesses unique sounds, grammar and syntax, and to account for these, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai - whilst in his first year of service in the Gilgit Scouts - developed his own Burushaski script, using an Arabic base to which he added eight special letters and ten vowel symbols (for more on &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s contribution to the Burushaski language, see the section on Burushaski&#x27;). Using this script, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai wrote the first known Burushaski poem in 1940, which is still widely recited today. &#x27;Allamah Hunzai jests at his misfortune in the absence of a photocopier in 1940, because the popularity of his poem within the Gilgit Scouts meant having to hand-write hundreds of copies of the poem upon request from his peers, who wished to take it home to their families. Among these peers were sergeants Tahwil Shah and Hasan &#x27;Ali, who recited the poem with rhythm and melody. Thus began the tradition of Burushaski poetry and its recitation, which is today part of everyday life in Hunza.

&#x27;Allamah Hunzai resigned from the Gilgit Scouts on 1 September 1943, and joined the British Indian army in Srinagar on 5 October in the same year. He was released on his own request therefrom on 7 February 1946, and set off for Bombay, where the Diamond Jubilee of the 48th Isma&#x27;ili Imam, Sultan Muhammad Shah, was to take place.

== Philosophy, theology and hermeneutics ==
Across 125 works of prose, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai thoroughly repurposes and builds extensively upon classical Isma&#x27;ili thought, with original theological, metaphysical and teleological expositions that draw on the historically unprecedented philosophical injunctions of the 48th Isma&#x27;ili Imam, Sultan Muhammad Shah. In addition, his works constitute a vast corpus of original Isma&#x27;ili esoteric exegesis, which reflects a deeper engagement with the process of ta&#x27;wil (lit. to return a thing to its origin) than can be found in previous Isma&#x27;ili hermeneutical works. These aspects of his works are very briefly elaborated upon below:

=== Metaphysics ===
Among the historically unprecedented philosophical injunctions of the 48th Isma&#x27;ili Imam is his declaration that &quot;Islam&#x27;s basic principle can only be defined as monorealism and not as monotheism&quot;. Drawing on this injunction and others, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai develops a monistic metaphysical framework wherein the absence of an ontological barrier between mind and matter offers a solution to the problem of causal interaction that plagues much of substance dualist philosophy, whilst still accounting for their difference with respect to properties, inasmuch as his framework posits one.

=== Teleology ===
&#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s monistic metaphysical framework lays the foundation for his teleological expositions, which build extensively upon the notion of the Neoplatonic Second&#x27;s return to perfection, demonstrating its eventual superiority over the First to be part of its &quot;telos&quot;, and positing an individualistic context to which the scale of the Neoplatonic regression applies.

=== Theology ===
&#x27;Allamah Hunzai affirms and extensively develops the notion of the carnal soul&#x27;s annihilation - which also features heavily in his hermeneutics - but also posits an original exposition of the rational soul&#x27;s annihilation, drawing on the recurring notion of a two-fold process of ontological return throughout the sayings of the Prophets. For &#x27;Allamah Hunzai, it is this second annihilation that marks one&#x27;s &quot;fana&#x27;&quot; in and &quot;baqa&quot;&#x27; with God.

=== Hermeneutics ===
Past Isma&#x27;ili hermeneutical works deal primarily with interpreting scriptural symbolism by appeal to the phenomena of the hierarchy in which the Isma&#x27;ili summons was ordered, known as the &quot;hudud al-din&quot;. Doubt was thus cast on the relevancy of this past corpus of exegesis following the 48th Isma&#x27;ili Imam&#x27;s abolishment of this physical hierarchy. &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s corpus of esoteric exegesis both extensively expands and saves the Isma&#x27;ili hermeneutical tradition from the charge of redundancy, by elucidating scriptural parables with respect to the phenomena in and between an individual&#x27;s quadripartite soul, offering a deeper return (ta&#x27;wil) of scriptural symbolism in doing so.

== Poetry ==
&#x27;Allamah Hunzai wrote the first known Burushaski poem in 1940 during his service in the Gilgit Scouts, and thereafter continued to compose scores of poems in Burushaski, Urdu and Persian, which spanned a range of devotional and philosophical genres. In 1951, he began to compose poetry in Uighur, having mastered the language during his missionary work in Xinjiang. In 1961, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai published his first poetry collection, entitled &quot;Nagmah-yi Israfil&quot;, which featured a selection of his Burushaski poems. The collection was telegrammed in the same year to the 49th Isma&#x27;ili Imam, Shah Karim al-Husayni, who, in his response, ascribed to &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s collection the status of a &quot;ginan book in the Burushaski language&#x27;. As the late van-Skyhawk notes, this had the effect of sacralising &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s poetry for the Isma&#x27;ilis, and thus his poems were and continue to be widely recited in Isma&#x27;ili jama&#x27;at-khanas following this exchange. &#x27;Allamah Hunzai went on to publish numerous further poetry collections, including his &quot;Manzumat-i Nasiri&quot;, &quot;Jawahir-i Ma&#x27;arif&quot; and &quot;Bihishte Asqurin&quot;, which amalgamated his Burushaski, Urdu, Persian and Uighur poetry, as well as his &quot;Diwan-i Nasiri&quot; - the first Diwan of poetry in Burushaski. In 1980, a Latin-script transliteration of this Diwan was published, having been rendered by Professors Ettiene Tiffou and Yves Charles Morin of the University of Montréal, who had prior to this approached &#x27;Allamah Hunzai for assistance with their research on the Burushaski language. In addition to his Burushaski Diwan, &#x27;Allamah Hunzai also published a twelve-volume Urdu Diwan, comprising thousands of poems. In 1996, a selection of &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s Uighur, Urdu, Persian and Burushaski poems was chosen to feature in an anthology of Isma&#x27;ili poetry entitled &quot;Shimmering Light&quot;, published by I.B. Tauris in association with the Institute of Isma&#x27;ili Studies.

=== Renditions ===
Musical of renditions of &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s poetry have amassed millions of views across the several streaming platforms to which they have been shared. Bayan&#x27;s 2016 hit, Raz-i Fitna, is a rendition of an Urdu poem published in &#x27;Allamah Hunzai&#x27;s &quot;Guldastah-yi Irfan&quot;.

<text>The Venetian Ghetto was the area of Venice in which Jews were forced to live by the government of the Venetian Republic. The English word &quot;ghetto&quot; is derived from the Jewish ghetto in Venice. The Venetian Ghetto was instituted on 29 March 1516 by decree of Doge Leonardo Loredan and the Venetian Senate. It was not the first time that Jews in Venice were compelled to live in a segregated area of the city. In 1555, Venice had 160,208 inhabitants, including 923 Jews, who were mainly merchants.

Between 1541 and 1633, the Ghetto Vecchio and Ghetto Nuovo were made to accommodate the increase in Jewish immigration, but the total number of Jews in Italy did not exceed 25,000. The Jewish community in Venice did not exceed 5,000 until the early seventeenth century.

In 1797, the French Army of Italy, commanded by the 28-year-old General Napoleon Bonaparte, occupied Venice, forced the Venetian Republic to dissolve itself on 12 May 1797, and ended the ghetto&#x27;s separation from the city on the 11th of July of the same year. In the 19th century, the ghetto was renamed the &quot;Contrada dell&#x27;unione&quot;.

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;ghetto&quot; (&quot;ghèto&quot; in the Venetian language) are disputed. Among the theories are:
*&quot;ghetto&quot; comes from &quot;giotto&quot; or &quot;geto&quot;, meaning &quot;foundry&quot;, since the first Jewish quarter was near a foundry that once made cannons; &quot;ghetto&quot;, from Italian &quot;getto&quot;, which is the act of, or the resulting object from, pouring molted metal into a mold, as old state foundries existed in this city quarter 
*&quot;ghetto&quot; formerly meant &quot;street&quot; (like German &quot;Gasse&quot;, Swedish &quot;gata&quot;, and Gothic &quot;gatwo&quot;)
*&quot;ghetto&quot; comes from &quot;borghetto&quot;, diminutive of &quot;borgo&quot;, meaning &quot;little town&quot;
*&quot;ghetto&quot; is related to the Hebrew word &quot;get&quot;, meaning a divorce document.

The Oxford University Press etymologist Anatoly Liberman 2009 reviewed many theories and concluded that all were speculative.

Historian Donatella Calabi argued in the documentary &quot;Venice and the Ghetto&quot; (2017, Klaus T. Steindl) that &quot;ghetto&quot; comes from the Italian word &quot;gettare&quot; [dʒet·ˈta:·re] which means &quot;throw away&quot;, because the area was before then a waste dump for foundries. The first Jewish arrivals were German and they pronounced the word [ˈɡɛto]—the spelling followed (&quot;h&quot; after &quot;g&quot; changes [dʒ] to [ˈɡ]). The same opinion was published in her book &quot;Venezia e il ghetto. Cinquecento anni del &quot;recinto deli ebrei&quot;&quot;. Marcella Ansaldi, director of the Jewish Museum of Venice, endorses this theory in a history video.

The author of &quot;Ghetto: The History of a Word&quot;, Daniel B. Schwartz, endorses the theories that the term &quot;ghetto&quot; did not emerge as a result of Jewish resident segregation, but rather, that the word is a relic of a history that preceded the arrival of the Jewish residents. Schwartz states that the strongest argument in support of this is how the original area to which Jews were restricted was called the Ghetto Nuovo, and not the Ghetto Vecchio. &quot;Were it otherwise, one would expect that the first site of the Jewish enclosure would have been known as the &#x27;Old Ghetto&#x27; and the subsequent addition as the &#x27;New Ghetto.&#x27;&quot;

==Location and geography==

The Ghetto is an area of the Cannaregio sestiere of Venice, divided into the &quot;Ghetto Nuovo&quot; (&quot;New Ghetto&quot;), and the adjacent &quot;Ghetto Vecchio&quot; (&quot;Old Ghetto&quot;). These names of the ghetto sections are misleading, as they refer to an older and newer site at the time of their use by the foundries: in terms of Jewish residence, the Ghetto Nuovo is actually older than the Ghetto Vecchio. The ghetto was connected to the rest of the city by two bridges that were only open during the day. Gates were opened in the morning at the ringing of the &quot;marangona&quot;, the largest bell in St. Mark&#x27;s &quot;Campanile&quot; (belfry), and locked in the evening. Permanent, round-the-clock surveillance of the gates occurred at the Jewish residents&#x27; expense. Strict penalties were to be imposed on any Jewish resident caught outside after curfew. Areas of Ghetto Nuovo that were open to the canal were to be sealed off with walls, while outward facing quays were to be bricked over in order to make it impossible for unauthorized entry or exit. The area that was considered to be &quot;Ghetto Vecchio&quot; later on, was once an area where Christians lived and once the Christians relocated, the area became available for non-Venetian Jewish merchants to stay while working in the city temporarily.

==Culture==

Though it was home to a large number of Jews, the population living in the Venetian Ghetto never assimilated to form a distinct, &quot;Venetian Jewish&quot; ethnicity. Four of the five synagogues were clearly divided according to ethnic identity: separate synagogues existed for the German (the &quot;Scuola Grande Tedesca&quot;), Italian (the &quot;Scuola Italiana&quot;), Spanish and Portuguese (the &quot;Scuola Spagnola&quot;), and Levantine Sephardi communities (the &quot;Scuola Levantina&quot;). The fifth, the &quot;Scuola Canton&quot;, was possibly built as a private synagogue and also served the Venetian Ashkenazi community. Today, there are also other populations of Ashkenazic Jews in Venice, mainly Lubavitchers who operate a kosher food store, a yeshiva, and a Chabad synagogue.

Languages historically spoken in the confines of the Ghetto include Venetian, Judeo-Italian, Judeo-Spanish, French, and Yiddish. In addition, Hebrew was traditionally (and still is) used on signage, inscriptions, and for official purposes such as wedding contracts (as well as, of course, in religious services). Today, English is widely used in the shops and the Museum because of the large number of English-speaking tourists.

A large portion of the culture of the Venetian Ghetto was the struggle that existed for Jews to travel outside of the ghetto, especially for employment purposes. Life in the Venetian Ghetto was very restricted, and movement of Jews outside of the ghetto was difficult. Inspired by lives of Jewish merchants outside of Venice, Rodriga, a prominent Jewish Spanish merchant, took on the role of advocating for Venetian Jews to have rights similar to others in different locations. Rodriga cited that Jews played a part in the Italian economy which could not be ignored. In return for the changing of Jewish restrictions, Rodriga promised that the Venetian economy and commerce would increase.

==Ghetto today==


Today, the Ghetto is still a center of Jewish life in the city. The Jewish community of Venice, which numbers around 450 people, is culturally active. However, only a few Jews actually live in the Ghetto because the area has become expensive.

Every year, there is an international conference on Hebrew Studies, with particular reference to the history and culture of the Veneto. Other conferences, exhibitions and seminars are held throughout the year.

The temples not only serve as places of worship but also provide lessons on the sacred texts and the Talmud for both children and adults, along with courses in Modern Hebrew, while other social facilities include a kindergarten, an old people&#x27;s home, the kosher guest house Rimon Place, the kosher restaurant Ba Ghetto Venezia, and the bakery Volpe. Along with its architectural and artistic monuments, the community also boasts a Museum of Jewish Art, the Renato Maestro Library and Archive and the new Info Point inside the Midrash Leon da Modena.

In the Ghetto area there is also a yeshiva, several Judaica shops, and a Chabad synagogue run by Chabad of Venice. Although few Venetian Jews still live in the Ghetto, many return there during the day for religious services at the two synagogues still actively used for worship (the other three are only used for guided tours, offered by the Jewish Community Museum).

Chabad of Venice also runs a pastry shop and a restaurant named &quot;Gam Gam&quot; in the Ghetto. Sabbath meals are served at the restaurant&#x27;s outdoor tables along the Cannaregio Canal with views of the Guglie Bridge near the Grand Canal. In the novel &quot;Much Ado About Jesse Kaplan,&quot; the restaurant is the site of a historical mystery. Canal boats carrying a sukkah and a menorah tour the city annually during the festivals of Sukkot and Hanukkah, respectively.

==Notable residents==
Notable residents of the Ghetto have included Leon of Modena, whose family originated in France, as well as his disciple Sara Copia Sullam. She was an accomplished writer, debater (through letters), and even hosted her own salon. Meir Magino, the famous glassmaker also came from the ghetto.

<doc id="985423" wikidata="Q55393" url="?curid=985423" title="Jacques Tourneur">
<text>Jacques Tourneur (; ; November 12, 1904 – December 19, 1977) was a French-American filmmaker, active during the Golden Age of Hollywood. He was known as an auteur of stylish and atmospheric genre films, many of them for RKO Pictures, including the horror films &quot;Cat People&quot;, &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot;, and &quot;The Leopard Man&quot;, and the classic film noir &quot;Out of the Past&quot;. He is also known for directing &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;, which was released by Columbia Pictures.

==Life==
Born in Paris, France, Tourneur was the son of Fernande Petit and film director Maurice Tourneur. At age 10, Jacques moved to the United States with his father. He started a career in cinema while still attending high school as an extra and later as a script clerk in various silent films. Both Maurice and Jacques returned to France after his father worked on the film &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; in 1925. Tourneur died in 1977, aged 73, in Bergerac, Dordogne, France.

==Career==
Tourneur began work as an editor and assistant director. He made his debut as a director on the French film &quot;&quot; in 1931. In 1934, Tourneur went to Hollywood, where he had a contract with MGM Studios. While working as the second unit director on the film &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; he met film producer Val Lewton.

Tourneur made his feature debut as director in the 1939 film &quot;They All Come Out&quot;. After Tourneur was dropped by MGM in 1941, he was picked up by Lewton to film several acclaimed low-budget horror films for RKO Studios including &quot;Cat People&quot; and &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot;.

&quot;Cat People&quot;, his first commercial success, although considered a B movie and made on a limited budget, was distinguished by a style of lighting and cinematography that has been imitated countless times. Tourneur was promoted to the A-list at RKO, directing films including &quot;Out of the Past&quot; and &quot;Berlin Express&quot;. In the 1950s, Tourneur became a freelance director, filming various genre films including &quot;Wichita&quot;, &quot;Anne of the Indies&quot;, &quot;Way of a Gaucho&quot;, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot;, &quot;Stars In My Crown&quot; and &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;. His last two films, made for American International Pictures and starring Vincent Price, were &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963) and &quot;War-Gods of the Deep&quot; (1965).

After his final days working for film, Tourneur began directing television episodes. Tourneur filmed episodes of &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and &quot;The Alaskans&quot;. Tourneur&#x27;s final director credit was for an episode of &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot; in 1966. Tourneur then retired and returned to France.

<text>San Lazzaro degli Armeni (, &quot;Saint Lazarus of the Armenians&quot;; sometimes called Saint Lazarus Island in English; ) is a small island in the Venetian Lagoon which has been home to the monastery of the Mekhitarists, an Armenian Catholic congregation, since 1717. It is one of the two primary centers of the congregation, along with the monastery in Vienna.

The islet lies to the southeast of Venice proper and west of the Lido and covers an area of . Settled in the 9th century, it was a leper colony during the Middle Ages, but fell into disuse by the early 18th century. In 1717 San Lazzaro was ceded by the Republic of Venice to Mkhitar Sebastatsi, an Armenian Catholic monk, who established a monastery with his followers. It has since been the headquarters of the Mekhitarists and, as such, one of the world&#x27;s prominent centers of Armenian culture and Armenian studies. Numerous important publications, such as the first complete dictionary of the Armenian language (1749–69) and the first modern history of Armenia (1781–86), were made in the island by the monks which made it an early major center of Armenian printing.

San Lazzaro has been enlarged nearly four times from its original size through land reclamation. It was recognized as an academy by Napoleon in 1810 when nearly all monasteries of Venice were abolished. A significant episode in its history is Lord Byron&#x27;s visit in 1816–17. The island is one of the best known historic sites of the Armenian diaspora. The monastery has a large collection of books, journals, artifacts, and the third largest collection of Armenian manuscripts (more than 3,000). Over the centuries, dozens of artists, writers, political and religious leaders have visited the island. It has since become a tourist destination.

==Overview==
San Lazzaro lies to the southeast of Venice proper and west of the Lido. The rectangular-shaped islet covers an area of . 

The island is accessible by a vaporetto from the San Zaccaria station with guided tours available in multiple languages with prior reservations only. Some 40,000 people visit the island annually, with Italians making up the majority of visitors. Sylvia Sprigge noted in 1961 that it is the only island in the Venetian Lagoon to be &quot;completely equipped, down to the last detail, for tourists’ visits.&quot; 

===Population===
The number of monks, students, and other residents at San Lazzaro has fluctuated throughout history. Twelve monks led by Mkhitar Sebastatsi arrived in Venice in 1715. A century later, in 1816, when Byron visited the island, there were some 70 Mekhitarists in San Lazzaro. Their number has been smaller thereafter. By the early 1840s, the island housed 50 monks and students, and 24 by 1880. By 1960, some 20 resident monks were reported. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer noted in 1998 that San Lazzaro is still a &quot;monastic hub of activity,&quot; although at the time the monastery housed only 10 seminarians and 10 fathers. Eight monks resided in 2004, while as of 2015, twelve &quot;vardapets&quot; (educated monks) and five novices reside in San Lazzaro.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The recorded history of the island begins in the 9th century. In 810, the Republic of Venice allocated the island to the abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of St. Ilario of Fusina. Leone Paolini, a local nobleman, obtained the island as a gift from the Abbot Uberto di Sant&#x27;Ilario and built a church, initially dedicated to Pope Leo I. It soon became an asylum for those infected with leprosy. In the 12th century, leprosy had appeared in Venice as a result of trade with the East. Paolini transferred the simple hospital of San Trovaso to the island. Thus, a leper colony was established at the island, which was chosen for that purpose due to its relative distance from the principal islands forming the city of Venice. It received its name from St. Lazarus, the patron saint of lepers. The church of San Lazzaro was founded in 1348, which is attested by an inscription in Gothic script. In the same year, the hospital was renovated and its ownership transferred from the Benedictines to the patriarchal cathedral of San Pietro. Leprosy declined by the mid-1500s and the island was abandoned by 1601 when only the chaplain and some gardeners remained at the island to grow vegetables. In the second half of the 17th century the island was leased to various religious groups. In 1651 a Dominican order settled at the island after fleeing from Turkish-occupied Crete. Jesuits also briefly settled there. By the early 18th century only a few crumbling ruins remained.

===Armenian period===

====Establishment====
In April 1715, a group of twelve Armenian Catholic monks led by Mkhitar Sebastatsi (English: Mekhitar of Sebaste, Italian: Mechitar) arrived in Venice from Morea (the Peloponnese), following its invasion by the Ottoman Empire. The monks were members of a Catholic order founded by Mkhitar in 1701, in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The order moved to Modone (Methoni), on the southern shore of the Peloponnese, in 1703, after repressions by the Ottoman government and the Armenian Apostolic Church. In 1712 the order received recognition by Pope Clement XI. Victor Langlois wrote that a Venetian admiral and the Venetian governor of Morea, &quot;sympathizing deeply with the fearful distress of the unfortunate community, yielded to their earnest entreaties for permission to embark on a government vessel which was about to leave for Venice.&quot;

On September 8, 1717, on the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, the Venetian Senate ceded San Lazzaro to Mkhitar and his companions, who agreed not to rename the island. He was reminded of the monastery on the island of Lake Sevan, where he had sought education earlier in his life. Upon acquisition, the monks began works of restoration of existing buildings on the island. The entire community then relocated to the island in April 1718 when the buildings on San Lazzaro became habitable. Mkhitar himself designed the plan of the monastery, which was completed by 1840. The monastery originally included 16 cells for monks, which were adjusted from the old hospital. The church&#x27;s restoration lasted from May to November 1722. Mkhitar died in 1749. The bell tower was completed a year later, in 1750.

====Later history====

The Venetian Republic was disestablished by Napoleon in 1797. In 1810, he abolished all monastic orders of Venice and the Kingdom of Italy, except that of the Mekhitarists in San Lazzaro. The Mekhitarist congregation was left in peace, according to some sources, due to the intercession of Roustam Raza, Napoleon&#x27;s Mamluk bodyguard of Armenian origin. Napoleon signed a decree, dated August 27, 1810, which declared that the congregation may continue to exist as an academy. Since then, San Lazzaro has also been known as an academy, and sometimes referred to in Latin as &quot;Academia Armena Sancti Lazari&quot;.

The monastery has been enlarged significantly through land reclamation four times since the 19th century. First, in 1815, the Mekhitarists were permitted by Austrian Emperor Francis II to expand the island. The area north of the island was filled which doubled its area from 7,900 m2 to 13,700 m2. In 1836, a boundary wall around the island&#x27;s newly reclaimed area was built. The channel of the boathouse was filled in 1912 and it was moved to the far western corner. The shoreline was straightened. These adjustments increased its area to 16,970 m2. San Lazzaro&#x27;s latest major enlargement occurred in post-World War II period. Between 1947 and 1949, the island was expanded on the southeast and the southwest. The island now has an area of 30,000 m2 or 3 hectares.

====20th century and beyond====

The island was heavily affected by the unprecedented &quot;acqua alta&quot; of November 4, 1966. The flooded sea water entered the main church and flooded the enclosed garden for around 12 hours. The library and the manuscript depository were not affected by the flood and none of the churchmen suffered injuries. 

A fire broke out on the night of December 8, 1975, which partially destroyed the library and damaged the southern side of the church, and destroyed two Gaspare Diziani paintings.

Between 2002 and 2004, an extensive restoration of the monastery&#x27;s structures was carried out by the Magistrato alle acque under the coordination of Consorzio Venezia Nuova, an agency of the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. It included restoration of the island&#x27;s shores and its walls and the boathouse.
In 2017 the 300th anniversary of San Lazzaro&#x27;s Mekhitarist order was celebrated on the island and in Armenia, including with a postage stamp and academic conferences.

San Lazzaro was heavily affected by a flood on November 13, 2019, the heaviest since 1966. The church, the central courtyard, and all the rooms on the ground floor were flooded, while the library, gallery, manuscript repository, and archives were unharmed. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian expressed solidarity with the monks, while Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited the congregation a week after the flood, expressing support and appreciation for their work.

In recent years, the island has hosted significant events. In 2015, it hosted the pavilion of Armenia during the 56th Venice Biennale, which was dedicated to the Armenian Genocide centenary and won the Golden Lion award in the national participation category. In 2021 the Aurora Prize ceremony took place there, with the attendance of Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, and featuring a performance by Andrea Bocelli.

==Monastery==
San Lazzaro is entirely occupied by the Mekhitarist monastery of San Lazzaro, which is the headquarters of the Armenian Catholic Mekhitarist Congregation. The monastery is known in Armenian as Մխիթարեան Մայրավանք, &quot;M(ə)khitarian Mayravank&quot;, which literally translates to the &quot;Mekhitarist Mother Monastery&quot; and in Italian as &quot;Monastero Mechitarista&quot;. The monastery currently contains a church with a bell tower, residential quarters, library, museums, picture gallery, manuscript repository, printing plant, sundry teaching and research facilities, gardens, a bronze statue of Mkhitar erected by Antonio Baggio in 1962, an Armenian genocide memorial erected in the 1960s, and a 14th-century basalt &quot;khachkar&quot; (cross stone) donated by the Soviet Armenian government in 1987.

The cloister of the monastery consists of a colonnade of 42 columns in the Doric order. There is a 15th-century water well in the center of the cloister, which is surrounded by trees and shrubs. A Phoenician and early Christian inscriptions, a first century headless statue of a Roman noble from Aquileia and other artifacts were found there.

The bell tower with an onion dome was completed in 1750. It is not attached to the church and stands alone near the northern side of the church.

===The church===
The church of San Lazzaro, although renovated several times through centuries, retains the 14th century pointed arch style. The church was restored extensively by Mkhitar in 1722, five years after the settlement of Armenian monks. He completely rebuilt the altar. Its apse was extended in 1899 primarily with an addition of neo-Gothic elements. The church has a neo-Gothic interior. It is three-naved, supported by 6 red marble columns. The main altar is in Baroque style. The three main windows of the altar&#x27;s apse have stained glass which depict from left to right: Sahak Patriarch, Saint Lazarus, and Mesrop Mashtots. In the church, there are frescoes and paintings by Antonio Ermolao Paoletti depicting Saint Peter, Saint Paul, John the Baptist and Saint Stephen. The tomb of Mkhitar is located in the front of the altar.

Besides the main altar, there are four other altars dedicated to the Holy Cross, St. Gregory the Illuminator, Mary, and Anthony the Great. All built in the period of 1735–38 by Mkhitar. They are all adorned by pieces of works, mainly by Venetian artists. The St. Gregory altarpiece by Noè Bordignon depicts the saint performing the baptism of the Armenian king Tiridates III. The altarpiece dedicated to the mother of Jesus depicts the Nativity of Mary by Domenico Maggiotto. The altarpiece of St. Anthony by Francesco Zugno depicts the founder of the Oriental monasticism who inspired Mkhitar.

;Paintings 
Within the church, there are paintings of Armenian saints by Paoletti created in 1901: Ghevond, Hripsime, Nerses of Lambron, Nerses the Great, Sandukht, Vardan, Gregory of Narek, Nerses Shnorhali. Other significant paintings include Madonna with Child by Palma il Giovane (Jacopo Negretti), the baptism of king Tiridates III by St. Gregory the Illuminator by Hovhannes Patkerahan (1720), Assumption of Mary by Jacopo Bassano, Annunciation and Mother of Mercy by Matteo Cesa, the Flood by Leandro Bassano, Flight into Egypt by Marco Basaiti, Annunciation by Bernardo Strozzi, St. Thecla and Sts. Peter and Paul by Girolamo da Santacroce, &quot;Moses Saved from the Waters&quot; and Archangel Raphael by Luca Carlevarijs.

===Gardens===
The gardens of the monastery have been admired by many visitors. &quot;The island ... with its flower and fruit gardens, is so well kept that an excursion to San Lazzaro is a favourite one with all visitors to Venice,&quot; noted one visitor in 1905. Irish botanist Edith Blake wrote: &quot;The garden in the centre of the cloisters was gay with flowers, and there was a calm, peaceful air of repose over the whole place.&quot;

The monks at San Lazzaro make jam from the roses grown in the gardens. The jam, called &quot;Vartanush&quot;, is made from rose petal around May, when the roses are in full bloom. Besides rose petal, it contains white caster sugar, water, and lemon juice. Around five thousand jars of jam are made and sold in the gift shop in the island. Monks also eat it for breakfast.

==Collections==
===Library===
The library contains 150,000 to 200,000 printed books in Armenian, as well as European and Oriental languages. Some 30,000 European books printed before 1800 are kept at the library. The entire collection includes books on the arts, the sciences, history, natural history, diverse classical texts, literary criticism, major encyclopedias and other reference books.

The floor of the library is decorated in a Venetian style. Its ceiling, partially destroyed in the 1975 fire, was painted by Francesco Zugno and depicts Catherine of Alexandria, the four fathers of the Latin Church (Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, St. Gregory the Great), and fathers of the Armenian Church. A chalk sculpture of Napoleon II by Antonio Canova is preserved in a glass cabinet in the library. A sculpture of Pope Gregory XVI by Giuseppe De Fabris, presented to the Mekhitarists by the Pope himself, is also kept at the room.

In 2021 the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative donated $50,000 to support the library in memory of Vartan Gregorian.

As the collection grows through gifts and purchases, the congregation is facing a space shortage, particularly in the library, where the lack of room is especially concerning.

===Manuscripts===

The Mekhitarists regard the collection of manuscripts the greatest treasure of San Lazzaro. During the 19th century, Mekhitarist monks extracted from these manuscripts and published some previously unpublished pieces of Armenian and non-Armenian literature. According to the magazine of the Church of England, by 1870, San Lazzaro had the second largest collection of Armenian manuscripts after Etchmiadzin having some 1,200 manuscripts in possession. The exact current number of manuscripts preserved at San Lazzaro is unknown. According to Bernard Coulie the number is around 3,000, which comprises some 10% of all extant Armenian manuscripts. According to the Mekhitarist Congregation website the monastery contains 4,500 Armenian manuscripts. &quot;Armenian Weekly&quot; writer Levon Saryan noted that the manuscript collection of San Lazzaro consists of over 3,000 complete volumes and about 2,000 fragments. San Lazzaro is usually ranked as the third largest collection of Armenian manuscripts in the world after the Matenadaran in Yerevan, Armenia and the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The manuscript collection is kept in the rotunda-shaped tower, called the Manuscript Room (manuscript repository). Its construction was funded by Cairo-based Armenian antiques dealer Boghos Ispenian and was designed by his son Andon Ispenian. It was inaugurated in 1970 in attendance of Catholicos Vazgen I.

The earliest manuscripts preserved at the repository date to the eighth century. Among its notable manuscripts are the 9th century Gospels of Queen Mlké, the early 11th century Adrianopolis Gospel; the &quot;Life of Alexander the Great&quot;, an Armenian translation of a 5th-century Greek version by Pseudo-Callistene; the Gospels of Gladzor (dated 1307). In 1976–79 some 300 manuscripts were donated by Harutiun Kurdian, for which new display cases were added. It holds one of the ten extant copies of &quot;Urbatagirk&quot;, the first-ever Armenian book printed by Hakob Meghapart in Venice in 1512. Furthermore, 44 Armenian prayer scrolls (&quot;hmayil&quot;) are preserved at the repository.

===Armenian museum===
The Armenian museum was designed by Venetian architect Giovanni Rossi and completed in 1867. Seriously damaged by a 1975 fire, it was restored in its present from by Manouk Manoukian. It formerly served as the library of Armenian manuscripts and publications. The museum now houses items related to Armenian history and art, inducing helmets and bronze belts from the Urartian period; the sword of Leo V, the last Armenian King of Cilicia, forged in Sis in 1366; Armenian ceramics from Kütahya; coins, stamps and a passport issued by the 1918–20 First Republic of Armenia. Numerous Armenian religious objects of art from the 16th to 18th centuries are on display. A bas-relief in agate from the medieval Armenian capital of Ani and a curtain formerly hang at the monastery of Lim Island on Lake Van are also on display, along with several paintings by Russian-Armenian marine artist Ivan Aivazovsky, including depictions of Mount Ararat and Niagara Falls. His Biblical creation-themed painting &quot;Chaos&quot; (1841) was donated to the congregation by Pope Leo XIII in 1901. The death mask of Komitas, the musicologist who established the Armenian national school of music, is also on display in the museum. Also on display is one of the most ancient swords ever found, originating from Anatolia and dating to the 3rd millennium BC.

===Oriental museum===
Oriental and Egyptian publications and artifacts are held in what is called the &quot;Lord Byron Room&quot;, because it is where he studied Armenian language and culture during his visit to San Lazzaro. It was originally the manuscript room. Its most notable item is the Egyptian mummy, sent to San Lazzaro in 1825 by Boghos Bey Yusufian, an Egyptian minister of Armenian origin. It is attributed to Namenkhet Amun, a priest at the Amon Temple in Karnak, and has been radiocarbon dated to 450–430 BC (late period of ancient Egypt), following the international scientific mission led by Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan to study the mummy, as reported in 1995. The mission validated Herodotus&#x27; claim that cedar sawdust was used by Ancient Egyptians for embalming, as it fills the stomach of the priest.

The collection also includes Etruscan vases, Chinese antiques, a princely Indian throne with ivory inlay work, and a rare papyrus in 12 segments in Pali of a Buddhist ritual, with bustrophedic writing in red lacquer on gold leaf brought from Madras by a Russian-Armenian archaeologist, who discovered it in a temple in 1830.

===Paintings===
Among the art works on display at the monastery corridors are charcoal drawings by Edgar Chahine, landscapes by Martiros Saryan, Mount Ararat by Gevorg Bashinjaghian, a marine painting by Charles Garabed Atamian and a collage by Sergei Parajanov (gifted by himself), a triptych by Francesco Zugno depicting the baptism of King Tiridates III by Gregory the Illuminator, various paintings by Luigi Querena, Binding of Isaac by Francesco Hayez, and others.

==Publishing house ==
A publishing house was established at the island in 1789. It was closed down in 1991, however, the Mekhitarists of San Lazzaro continue publication through their publishing house, &quot;Casa Editrice Armena&quot;. Until the early 20th century, a number of important publications were made on the island. Khachig Tölölyan wrote of the role the Mekhitarists and their publications:
The publications of the Mekhitarists, both in San Lazzaro and Vienna, contributed greatly to the refinement of literary Western Armenian. The San Lazzaro branch became particularly noted in the fields of history, the arts, and literature influenced by the Italian penchant for the arts. The publishing house printed books in dozens of languages, which included themes such as theology, history, linguistics, literature, natural sciences, and economics. They also published textbooks and translations from European languages and editions of classics.

===Significant publications ===
Among its publications, the most significant work is the two-volume dictionary of Classical Armenian: Բառգիրք Հայկազեան Լեզուի &quot;Baṛgirkʻ haykazean lezui&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of the Armenian Language&quot;, 1749–69), which made Armenian the sixth language (after Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish) to have such a complete dictionary. Its expanded and improved edition, Նոր Բառգիրք Հայկազեան Լեզուի, &quot;Nor baṛgirkʻ haykazean lezui&quot; (&quot;New Dictionary of the Armenian Language&quot;, 1836–37), is considered a monumental achievement and remains unsurpassed. Patrick Considine described the &quot;Nor baṛgirkʻ&quot; as the &quot;only really useful dictionary&quot; for work on the vocabulary of Classical Armenian (with the exception of Hrachia Acharian&#x27;s etymological dictionary). He called it a &quot;remarkable work of scholarship in its day and although as a tool of etymological research nearly a hundred and fifty years later it has obvious disadvantages, we should still be lost without it.&quot;

Mikayel Chamchian published the first modern history of Armenia in three volumes (1781–86). Ronald Grigor Suny argues that these publications laid the foundations for the emergence of secular Armenian nationalism. Beginning in 1800 a periodical journal has been published at the island. &quot;Bazmavēp&quot;, a literary, historical and scientific journal, was established in 1843 and continues to be published to this day.

==Role in Armenian history==
San Lazzaro has a great historical significance to Armenians and has been described as a &quot;little Armenia.&quot; Called &quot;a fragment of their lost homeland&quot;, it is one of the richest Armenian enclaves, and one of the best-known Armenian sites in the world, along with Jerusalem&#x27;s Armenian Quarter. It is also considered &quot;especially remarkable&quot; of the religious orders based in Venice and &quot;one of the most attractive corners of the lagoon.&quot;

William Dean Howells noted in 1866 that it is &quot;famed throughout the Armenian world.&quot; It has been called the &quot;centre of Armenian civilization&quot; and &quot;the most important Armenian settlement outside Armenia&quot;. American Protestant missionary Eli Smith noted in 1833 that the convent of San Lazzaro not only did not pursue the &quot;denationalizing system of many of the Romish missions among the oriental churches,&quot; but also has done &quot;more than all other Armenians together, to cultivate and enrich the literature of the nation.&quot; Louisa Stuart Costello called the Armenian convent of San Lazzaro &quot;a respectable pile, above the encircling waters, an enduring monument of successful perseverance in a good cause.&quot;

===Cultural awakening ===
According to Robert H. Hewsen for nearly a century—until the establishment of the Lazarev Institute in Moscow in 1815—the monastery of San Lazzaro was the only center of intensive Armenian cultural activity that held the heritage of the Armenian people. During the 18th century, the rediscovery of classical Armenian literature and the creation of an Armenian vernacular by the Mechitarists of San Lazzaro was a key factor in the &quot;Armenian Renaissance.&quot; Italian scholar Matteo Miele compared the work of the Mekhitarists carried out in the island to the work of the humanists, painters and sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. For over a century the monastery of San Lazzaro became the &quot;potent agency for the advancement of secular, as well as of religious, knowledge&quot; with &quot;avowed religious, educational, and literary objectives like those of the medieval Benedictine order.&quot;

;National consciousness and nationalism 
The activities of the island monastery, which became a center for Armenian studies, led to a revival of Armenian national consciousness. According to Harry Jewell Sarkiss the emphasis Mekhitarists of San Lazzaro put on &quot;their national history and language was significant, for thereby they planted the seeds&quot; of modern Armenian nationalism. Elizabeth Redgate writes that the developments in intellectual culture and scholarship in Russian Armenia and at the Mkhitarist monasteries of San Lazzaro and Vienna inspired an increased nationalism among Armenians in the 1880s. Mary Tarzian suggests that nationalism among Armenians in the Ottoman Empire emerged from the educational vision of the Mechitarists in San Lazzaro. This view was expressed as early as 1877 when Charles Yriarte wrote that the Armenians &quot;look with justice upon the island of San Lazzaro as the torch which shall one day illuminate Armenia, when the hour comes for her to live again in history and to take her place once more among free nations.&quot;

However, their activities were not without criticism. Mikael Nalbandian, a liberal and anti-clerical Russian-Armenian writer, wrote in the mid-19th century that the &quot;enlightenment of our nation must proceed from the hands of execrable papist monks! Their &#x27;light&#x27; is far more pernicious than darkness.&quot;

==Notable visitors==
A wide range of notable individuals have visited the island through centuries.

===Lord Byron===
English Romantic poet Lord Byron visited the island from November 1816 to February 1817. He acquired enough Armenian to translate passages from Classical Armenian into English. He co-authored &quot;English Grammar and Armenian&quot; in 1817, and &quot;Armenian Grammar and English&quot; in 1819, where he included quotations from classical and modern Armenian. The room where Byron studied now bears his name and is cherished by the monks. There is also a plaque commemorating Byron&#x27;s stay. Byron is considered the most prominent of all visitors of the island. James Morris wrote in 1960 that &quot;many people in Venice, asked to think of San Lazzaro, think first of Byron, and only secondly of the Armenians. Byron&#x27;s spirit haunts the island.&quot;

===Non-Armenians===
Pope Pius VII visited the island on May 9, 1800. Since the 19th century numerous notable individuals visited San Lazzaro, such as composers Jacques Offenbach, Gioachino Rossini, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Richard Wagner (1859), writers Alfred de Musset and George Sand (1834), Rudyard Kipling, Marcel Proust (1900), Ivan Turgenev, Nikolai Gogol, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, English polymath John Ruskin (early 1850s), and French historian Ernest Renan (1850).

U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and British Prime Minister William Gladstone visited San Lazzaro in 1878 and 1879, respectively.

An undocumented account claims that Joseph Stalin, a Bolshevik revolutionary at the time, worked as a bell-ringer at the monastery in 1907.

===Armenians===
The marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky visited San Lazzaro in 1840. He met his older brother, Gabriel, who was working at the monastery at that time. At the monastery library and the art gallery Aivazovsky familiarized himself with Armenian manuscripts and Armenian art in general. Another Armenian painter, Vardges Sureniants, visited San Lazzaro in 1881 to study Armenian miniatures. The ethnographer Yervand Lalayan spent six months in 1894 for research. The musicologist Komitas lectured on Armenian folk and sacred music and researched the Armenian music notation (&quot;khaz&quot;) system in the monastery library in July 1907. The first meeting of the poets Yeghishe Charents and Avetik Isahakyan took place in San Lazzaro in 1924. Two prominent Soviet Armenians, the composer Aram Khachaturian and the astrophysicist Viktor Ambartsumian visited in 1963 and 1969, respectively.

At least two catholicoi (leaders) of the Armenian Apostolic Church have visited the island: Vazgen I in 1958 and 1970, and Karekin II in 2008.

Since independence in 1991, four presidents of Armenia have visited: Robert Kocharyan in 2005, Serzh Sargsyan in 2011, Armen Sarkissian in 2019 and 2021, Vahagn Khachaturyan in 2024. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited in 2019, and his wife Anna Hakobyan in 2024. Armen Sarkissian said that he would love to live there, &quot;it’s a fantastic life.&quot;

Henrikh Mkhitaryan, the most prominent Armenian football player, married Betty Vardanyan at the monastery of San Lazzaro on June 17, 2019.

<doc id="985458" wikidata="Q27183" url="?curid=985458" title="Iñupiaq language">
<text>Iñupiaq or Inupiaq ( , ), also known as Iñupiat, Inupiat ( ), Iñupiatun or Alaskan Inuit, is an Inuit language, or perhaps group of languages, spoken by the Iñupiat people in northern and northwestern Alaska, as well as a small adjacent part of the Northwest Territories of Canada. The Iñupiat language is a member of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family, and is closely related and, to varying degrees, mutually intelligible with other Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers. Iñupiaq is considered to be a threatened language, with most speakers at or above the age of 40. Iñupiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska, along with several other indigenous languages.

The major varieties of the Iñupiaq language are the North Slope Iñupiaq and Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq dialects.

The Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. American territorial acquisition and the legacy of boarding schools have created a situation today where a small minority of Iñupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities.

== History ==
The Iñupiaq language is an Inuit language, the ancestors of which may have been spoken in the northern regions of Alaska for as long as 5,000 years. Between 1,000 and 800 years ago, Inuit migrated east from Alaska to Canada and Greenland, eventually occupying the entire Arctic coast and much of the surrounding inland areas. The Iñupiaq dialects are the most conservative forms of the Inuit language, with less linguistic change than the other Inuit languages.

In the mid to late 19th century, Russian, British, and American colonists made contact with Iñupiat people. In 1885, the American territorial government appointed Rev. Sheldon Jackson as General Agent of Education. Under his administration, Iñupiat people (and all Alaska Natives) were educated in English-only environments, forbidding the use of Iñupiaq and other indigenous languages of Alaska. After decades of English-only education, with strict punishment if heard speaking Iñupiaq, after the 1970s, most Iñupiat did not pass the Iñupiaq language on to their children, for fear of them being punished for speaking their language.

In 1972, the Alaska Legislature passed legislation mandating that if &quot;a [school is attended] by at least 15 pupils whose primary language is other than English, [then the school] shall have at least one teacher who is fluent in the native language&quot;.

Today, the University of Alaska Fairbanks offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Iñupiaq language and culture, while a preschool/kindergarten-level Iñupiaq immersion school named Nikaitchuat Iḷisaġviat teaches grades PreK-1st grade in Kotzebue.

In 2014, Iñupiaq became an official language of the State of Alaska, alongside English and nineteen other indigenous languages.

In 2018, Facebook added Iñupiaq as a language option on their website. In 2022, an Iñupiaq version of Wordle was created.

==Dialects==
There are four main dialect divisions and these can be organized within two larger dialect collections:
*Iñupiaq
**Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq is spoken on the Seward Peninsula. It has a possible Yupik substrate and is divergent from other Inuit languages.
***Qawiaraq
***Bering Strait
**Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq is spoken from the Northwest Arctic and North Slope regions of Alaska to the Mackenzie Delta in Northwest Territories, Canada. 
***Malimiut
***North Slope Iñupiaq

Extra geographical information:

Bering Strait dialect:

The Native population of the Big Diomede Island was moved to the Siberian mainland after World War II. The following generation of the population spoke Central Siberian Yupik or Russian. The entire population of King Island moved to Nome in the early 1960s. The Bering Strait dialect might also be spoken in Teller on the Seward Peninsula.

Qawiaraq dialect:

A dialect of Qawiaraq is spoken in Nome. A dialect of Qawariaq may also be spoken in Koyuk, Mary&#x27;s Igloo, Council, and Elim. The Teller sub-dialect may be spoken in Unalakleet.

Malimiutun dialect:

Both sub-dialects can be found in Buckland, Koyuk, Shaktoolik, and Unalakleet. A dialect of Malimiutun may be spoken in Deering, Kiana, Noorvik, Shungnak, and Ambler. The Malimiutun sub-dialects have also been classified as &quot;Southern Malimiut&quot; (found in Koyuk, Shaktoolik, and Unalakleet) and &quot;Northern Malimiut&quot; found in &quot;other villages&quot;.

North Slope dialect:

Common North Slope is &quot;a mix of the various speech forms formerly used in the area&quot;. The Point Barrow dialect was &quot;spoken only by a few elders&quot; in 2010. A dialect of North Slope is also spoken in Kivalina, Point Lay, Wainwright, Atqasuk, Utqiaġvik, Nuiqsut, and Barter Island.

==Phonology==
Iñupiaq dialects differ widely between consonants used. However, consonant clusters of more than two consonants in a row do not occur. A word may not begin nor end with a consonant cluster.

All Iñupiaq dialects have three basic vowel qualities: /a i u/. There is currently no instrumental work to determine what allophones may be linked to these vowels. All three vowels can be long or short, giving rise to a system of six phonemic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/. Long vowels are represented by double letters in the orthography: ⟨aa⟩, ⟨ii⟩, ⟨uu⟩. The following diphthongs occur: /ai ia au ua iu ui/. No more than two vowels occur in a sequence in Iñupiaq.

The Bering strait dialect has a fourth vowel /e/, which preserves the fourth proto-Eskimo vowel reconstructed as */ə/. In the other dialects, proto-Eskimo */e/ has merged with the closed front vowel /i/. The merged /i/ is referred to as the &quot;strong /i/&quot;, which causes palatalization when preceding consonant clusters in the North Slope dialect (see section on palatalization below). The other /i/ is referred to as &quot;the weak /i/&quot;. Weak and strong /i/s are not differentiated in orthography, making it impossible to tell which ⟨i⟩ represents palatalization &quot;short of looking at other processes which depend on the distinction between two i&#x27;s or else examining data from other Eskimo languages&quot;. However, it can be assumed that, within a word, if a palatal consonant is preceded by an ⟨i⟩, it is strong. If an alveolar consonant is preceded by an ⟨i⟩, it is weak.

Words begin with a stop (with the exception of the palatal stop /c/), the fricative /s/, nasals /m n/, with a vowel, or the semivowel /j/. Loanwords, proper names, and exclamations may begin with any segment in both the Seward Peninsula dialects and the North Slope dialects. In the Uummarmiutun dialect words can also begin with /h/. For example, the word for &quot;ear&quot; in North Slope and Little Diomede Island dialects is &quot;siun&quot; whereas in Uummarmiutun it is &quot;hiun&quot;.

A word may end in any nasal sound (except for the /ɴ/ found in North Slope), in the stops /t k q/ or in a vowel. In the North Slope dialect if a word ends with an m, and the next word begins with a stop, the m is pronounced /p/, as in &quot;aġnam tupiŋa,&quot; pronounced /aʁnap tupiŋa/

Very little information of the prosody of Iñupiaq has been collected. However, &quot;fundamental frequency (Hz), intensity (dB), loudness (sones), and spectral tilt (phons - dB) may be important&quot; in Malimiutun. Likewise, &quot;duration is not likely to be important in Malimiut Iñupiaq stress/syllable prominence&quot;.

=== North Slope Iñupiaq ===
For North Slope Iñupiaq


The voiceless stops /p/ /t/ /k/ and /q/ are not aspirated. This may or may not be true for other dialects as well.

/c/ is derived from a palatalized and unreleased /t/.

==== Assimilation ====

Source:

Two consonants cannot appear together unless they share the manner of articulation (in this case treating the lateral and approximant consonants as fricatives). The only exception to this rule is having a voiced fricative consonant appear with a nasal consonant. Since all stops in North Slope are voiceless, a lot of needed assimilation arises from having to assimilate a voiceless stop to a voiced consonant.

This process is realized by assimilating the first consonant in the cluster to a consonant that: 1) has the same (or closest possible) area of articulation as the consonant being assimilated to; and 2) has the same manner of articulation as the second consonant that it is assimilating to. If the second consonant is a lateral or approximant, the first consonant will assimilate to a lateral or approximant if possible. If not the first consonant will assimilate to a fricative. Therefore:

: * The sound /ɴ/ is not represented in the orthography. Therefore the spelling ġn can be pronounced as /ʁn/ or /ɴn/. In both examples 1 and 2, since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.

The stops /t̚ʲ/ and /t/ do not have a corresponding voiced fricative, therefore they will assimilate to the closest possible area of articulation. In this case, the /t̚ʲ/ will assimilate to the voiced approximant /j/. The /t/ will assimilate into a . Therefore:
(In the first example above note that &lt;sr&gt; denotes a single consonant, as shown in the alphabet section below, so the constraint of at most two consonants in a cluster, as mentioned above, is not violated.)

In the case of the second consonant being a lateral, the lateral will again be treated as a fricative. Therefore:

Since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.

The sounds and are not represented in the orthography (unless they occur alone between vowels). Therefore, like the /ɴn/ example shown above, assimilation still occurs while the spelling remains the same. Therefore:
These general features of assimilation are not shared with Uummarmiut, Malimiutun, or the Seward Peninsula dialects. Malimiutun and the Seward Peninsula dialects &quot;preserve voiceless stops (k, p, q, t) when they are etymological (i.e. when they belong to the original word-base)&quot;. Compare:
==== Palatalization ====

Source:

The following patterns of palatalization can occur in North Slope Iñupiaq: /t/ → /t̚ʲ/, or /s/; → ; → ; and /n/ → . Palatalization only occurs when one of these four alveolars is preceded by a strong &quot;i&quot;. Compare:

: Please note that the sound /t̚ʲ/ does not have its own letter, and is simply spelled with a T t. The IPA transcription of the above vowels may be incorrect.

If a t that precedes a vowel is palatalized, it will become an /s/. The strong &quot;i&quot; affects the entire consonant cluster, palatalizing all consonants that can be palatalized within the cluster. Therefore:

: Note in the first example, due to the nature of the suffix, the /q/ is dropped. Like the first set of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may be incorrect.

If a strong &quot;i&quot; precedes geminate consonant, the entire elongated consonant becomes palatalized. For Example: niġḷḷaturuq and tikiññiaqtuq.

==== Further strong versus weak &quot;i&quot; processes ====

Source:

The strong &quot;i&quot; can be paired with a vowel. The weak &quot;i&quot; on the other hand cannot. The weak i will become an &quot;a&quot; if it is paired with another vowel, or if the consonant before the &quot;i&quot; becomes geminate. This rule may or may not apply to other dialects. Therefore:

Like the first two sets of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may not be correct.

=== Uummarmiutun sub-dialect ===
For the Uummarmiutun sub-dialect:


==== Phonological rules ====
The following are the phonological rules:
The /f/ is always found as a geminate.

The /j/ cannot be geminated, and is always found between vowels or preceded by /v/. In rare cases it can be found at the beginning of a word.

The /h/ is never geminate, and can appear as the first letter of the word, between vowels, or preceded by /k/ /ɬ/ or /q/.

The and are always geminate or preceded by a /t/.

The can appear between vowels, preceded by consonants /k/ /q/ /t/ or /v/, or it can be followed by , /v/, .

=== Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq ===
For Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq:

Unlike the other Iñupiaq dialects, the Seward Peninsula dialect has a mid central vowel e (see the beginning of the phonology section for more information).

=== Gemination ===
In North Slope Iñupiaq, all consonants represented by orthography can be geminated, except for the sounds /s/ /h/ and . Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq (using vocabulary from the Little Diomede Island as a representative sample) likewise can have all consonants represented by orthography appear as geminates, except for /b/ /h/ /w/ /z/ and . Gemination is caused by suffixes being added to a consonant, so that the consonant is found between two vowels.

==Writing systems==

Iñupiaq was first written when explorers first arrived in Alaska and began recording words in the native languages. They wrote by adapting the letters of their own language to writing the sounds they were recording. Spelling was often inconsistent, since the writers invented it as they wrote. Unfamiliar sounds were often confused with other sounds, so that, for example, &#x27;q&#x27; was often not distinguished from &#x27;k&#x27; and long consonants or vowels were not distinguished from short ones.

Along with the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik, the Iñupiat eventually adopted the Latin script that Moravian missionaries developed in Greenland and Labrador. Native Alaskans also developed a system of pictographs, which, however, died with its creators.

In 1946, Roy Ahmaogak, an Iñupiaq Presbyterian minister from Utqiaġvik, worked with Eugene Nida, a member of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, to develop the current Iñupiaq alphabet based on the Latin script. Although some changes have been made since its origin—most notably the change from &#x27;ḳ&#x27; to &#x27;q&#x27;—the essential system was accurate and is still in use.

==Morphosyntax==
Due to the number of dialects and complexity of Iñupiaq morphosyntax, the following section discusses Malimiutun morphosyntax as a representative. Any examples from other dialects will be marked as such.

Iñupiaq is a polysynthetic language, meaning that words can be extremely long, consisting of one of three stems (verb stem, noun stem, and demonstrative stem) along with one or more of three endings (postbases, (grammatical) endings, and enclitics). The stem gives meaning to the word, whereas endings give information regarding case, mood, tense, person, plurality, etc. The stem can appear as simple (having no postbases) or complex (having one or more postbases). In Iñupiaq a &quot;postbase serves somewhat the same functions that adverbs, adjectives, prefixes, and suffixes do in English&quot; along with marking various types of tenses. There are six word classes in Malimiut Inñupiaq: nouns (see Nominal Morphology), verbs (see Verbal Morphology), adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, and interjections. All demonstratives are classified as either adverbs or pronouns.

=== Nominal morphology ===
The Iñupiaq category of number distinguishes singular, dual, and plural. The language works on an Ergative–Absolutive system, where nouns are inflected for number, several cases, and possession. Iñupiaq (Malimiutun) has nine cases, two core cases (ergative and absolutive) and seven oblique cases (instrumental, allative, ablative, locative, perlative, and vocative). North Slope Iñupiaq does not have the vocative case. Iñupiaq does not have a category of gender and articles.

Iñupiaq nouns can likewise be classified by Wolf A. Seiler&#x27;s seven noun classes. These noun classes are &quot;based on morphological behavior. [They] ... have no semantic basis but are useful for case formation ... stems of various classes interact with suffixes differently&quot;.

Due to the nature of the morphology, a single case can take on up to 12 endings (ignoring the fact that realization of these endings can change depending on noun class). For example, the possessed ergative ending for a class 1a noun can take on the endings: -ma, mnuk, pta, vich, ptik, -psi, -mi, -mik, -miŋ, -ŋan, -ŋaknik, and ŋata. Therefore, only general features will be described below. For an extensive list on case endings, please see Seiler 2012, Appendix 4, 6, and 7.

==== Absolutive case/noun stems ====
The subject of an intransitive sentence or the object of a transitive sentence take on the absolutive case. This case is likewise used to mark the basic form of a noun. Therefore, all the singular, dual, and plural absolutive forms serve as stems for the other oblique cases. The following chart is verified of both Malimiutun and North Slope Iñupiaq. 
If the singular absolutive form ends with -n, it has the underlying form of -ti /tə/. This form will show in the absolutive dual and plural forms. Therefore:

Regarding nouns that have an underlying /ə/ (weak i), the &quot;i&quot; will change to an &quot;a&quot; and the previous consonant will be geminated in the dual form. Therefore:

If the singular form of the noun ends with -k, the preceding vowel will be elongated. Therefore:

On occasion, the consonant preceding the final vowel is also geminated, though exact phonological reasoning is unclear.

==== Ergative case ====
The ergative case is often referred to as the Relative Case in Iñupiaq sources. This case marks the subject of a transitive sentence or a genitive (possessive) noun phrase. For non-possessed noun phrases, the noun is marked only if it is a third person singular. The unmarked nouns leave ambiguity as to who/what is the subject and object. This can be resolved only through context. Possessed noun phrases and noun phrases expressing genitive are marked in ergative for all persons.

This suffix applies to all singular unpossessed nouns in the ergative case.

Please note the underlying /tə/ form in the first example. 

==== Instrumental case ====
This case is also referred to as the modalis case. This case has a wide range of uses described below:
Since the ending is the same for both dual and plural, different stems are used. In all the examples the k is assimilated to an ŋ. 

==== Allative case ====
The allative case is also referred to as the terminalis case. The uses of this case are described below:
*It is unclear as to whether this example is regular for the dual form or not.

=== Numerals ===
Iñupiaq numerals are base-20 with a sub-base of 5. The numbers 1 to 20 are:

The sub-base of five shows in the words for 5, &quot;tallimat&quot;, and 15, &quot;akimiaq&quot;, to which the numbers 1 to 3 are added to create the words for 7, 8, 16, 17 and 18, etc. (&quot;itchaksrat&quot; &#x27;6&#x27; being irregular). Apart from &quot;sisamat&quot; &#x27;4&#x27;, numbers before a multiple of five are indicated with the subtractive element &quot;-utaiḷaq&quot;: &quot;quliŋŋuġutaiḷaq&quot; &#x27;9&#x27; from &quot;qulit&quot; &#x27;10&#x27;, &quot;akimiaġutaiḷaq&quot; &#x27;14&#x27; from &quot;akimiaq&quot; &#x27;15&#x27;, &quot;iñuiññaġutaiḷaq&quot; &#x27;19&#x27; from &quot;iñuiññaq&quot; &#x27;20&#x27;.

Scores are created with the element &quot;-kipiaq&quot;, and numbers between the scores are composed by adding 1 through 19 to these. Multiples of 400 are created with &quot;-agliaq&quot; and 8000&#x27;s with &quot;-pak&quot;. Note that these words will vary between singular &quot;-q&quot; and plural &quot;-t&quot;, depending on the speaker and whether they are being used for counting or for modifying a noun.
The system continues through compounding suffixes to a maximum of &quot;iñuiññagliaqpakpiŋatchaq&quot; (20×400×80003, ≈ 4 quadrillion), e.g.

There is also a decimal system for the hundreds and thousands, with the numerals &quot;qavluun&quot; for 100 and &quot;kavluutit&quot; for 1000, thus &quot;malġuk qavluun&quot; 200, &quot;malġuk kavluutit&quot; 2000, etc.

====Etymology====
The numeral five, &quot;tallimat&quot;, is derived from the word for hand/arm. The word for 10, &quot;qulit&quot;, is derived from the word for &quot;top&quot;, meaning the ten digits on the top part of the body. The numeral for 15, &quot;akimiaq&quot;, means something like &quot;it goes across&quot;, and the numeral for 20, &quot;iñuiññaq&quot; means something like &quot;entire person&quot; or &quot;complete person&quot;, indicating the 20 digits of all extremities.

=== Verbal morphology ===
Again, Malimiutun Iñupiaq is used as a representative example in this section. The basic structure of the verb is [(verb) + (derivational suffix) + (inflectional suffix) + (enclitic)], although Lanz (2010) argues that this approach is insufficient since it &quot;forces one to analyze ... optional ... suffixes&quot;. Every verb has an obligatory inflection for person, number, and mood (all marked by a single suffix), and can have other inflectional suffixes such as tense, aspect, modality, and various suffixes carrying adverbial functions.

==== Tense ====
Tense marking is always optional. The only explicitly marked tense is the future tense. Past and present tense cannot be marked and are always implied. All verbs can be marked through adverbs to show relative time (using words such as &quot;yesterday&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot;). If neither of these markings is present, the verb can imply a past, present, or future tense.
==== Aspect ====
Marking aspect is optional in Iñupiaq verbs. Both North Slope and Malimiut Iñupiaq have a perfective versus imperfective distinction in aspect, along with other distinctions such as: frequentative (-ataq; &quot;to repeatedly verb&quot;), habitual (-suu; &quot;to always, habitually verb&quot;), inchoative (-łhiñaaq; &quot;about to verb&quot;), and intentional (-saġuma; &quot;intend to verb&quot;). The aspect suffix can be found after the verb root and before or within the obligatory person-number-mood suffix.

==== Mood ====
Iñupiaq has the following moods: Indicative, Interrogative, Imperative (positive, negative), Coordinative, and Conditional. Participles are sometimes classified as a mood. 

Indicative mood endings can be transitive or intransitive, as seen in the table below.
=== Syntax ===
Nearly all syntactic operations in the Malimiut dialect of Iñiupiaq—and Inuit languages and dialects in general—are carried out via morphological means.The language aligns to an ergative-absolutive case system, which is mainly shown through nominal case markings and verb agreement (see above).

The basic word order is subject-object-verb. However, word order is flexible and both subject and/or object can be omitted. There is a tendency for the subject of a transitive verb (marked by the ergative case) to precede the object of the clause (marked by the absolutive case). There is likewise a tendency for the subject of an intransitive verb (marked by the absolutive case) to precede the verb. The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a clause (both marked by the absolutive case) are usually found right before the verb. However, &quot;this is [all] merely a tendency.&quot;

Iñupiaq grammar also includes morphological passive, antipassive, causative and applicative.

==== Noun incorporation ====
Noun incorporation is a common phenomenon in Malimiutun Iñupiaq. The first type of noun incorporation is &quot;lexical compounding&quot;. Within this subset of noun incorporation, the noun, which represents an instrument, location, or patient in relation to the verb, is attached to the front of the verb stem, creating a new intransitive verb. The second type is &quot;manipulation of case&quot;. It is argued whether this form of noun incorporation is present as noun incorporation in Iñupiaq, or &quot;semantically transitive noun incorporation&quot;—since with this kind of noun incorporation the verb remains transitive. The noun phrase subjects are incorporated not syntactically into the verb but rather as objects marked by the instrumental case. The third type of incorporation, &quot;manipulation of discourse structure&quot;, is supported by Mithun (1984) and argued against by Lanz (2010). See Lanz&#x27;s paper for further discussion. The final type of incorporation is &quot;classificatory noun incorporation&quot;, whereby a &quot;general [noun] is incorporated into the [verb], while a more specific [noun] narrows the scope&quot;. With this type of incorporation, the external noun can take on external modifiers and, like the other incorporations, the verb becomes intransitive. See &quot;Nominal Morphology&quot; (&quot;Instrumental Case, Usage of Instrumental&quot; table, row four) on this page for an example.

==== Switch-references ====
Switch-references occur in dependent clauses only with third person subjects. The verb must be marked as reflexive if the third person subject of the dependent clause matches the subject of the main clause (more specifically matrix clause). Compare:
==Text sample==
This is a sample of the Iñupiaq language of the Kivalina variety from &quot;Kivalina Reader,&quot; published in 1975.
Aaŋŋaayiña aniñiqsuq Qikiqtami. Aasii iñuguġuni. Tikiġaġmi Kivaliñiġmiḷu. Tuvaaqatiniguni Aivayuamik. Qulit atautchimik qitunġivḷutik. Itchaksrat iñuuvlutiŋ. Iḷaŋat Qitunġaisa taamna Qiñuġana.
This is the English translation, from the same source:
Aaŋŋaayiña was born in Shishmaref. He grew up in Point Hope and Kivalina. He marries Aivayuaq. They had eleven children. Six of them are alive. One of the children is Qiñuġana.

<text>In a corporation, a stakeholder is a member of &quot;groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist&quot;, as defined in the first usage of the word in a 1963 internal memorandum at the Stanford Research Institute. The theory was later developed and championed by R. Edward Freeman in the 1980s. Since then it has gained wide acceptance in business practice and in theorizing relating to strategic management, corporate governance, business purpose and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The definition of corporate responsibilities through a classification of stakeholders to consider has been criticized as creating a false dichotomy between the &quot;shareholder model&quot; and the &quot;stakeholder model&quot;, or a false analogy of the obligations towards shareholders and other interested parties.

==Types==
Any action taken by any organization or any group might affect those people who are linked with them in the private sector. For examples these are parents, children, customers, owners, employees, associates, partners, contractors, and suppliers, people that are related or located nearby. Broadly speaking there are three types of stakeholders:

*Primary stakeholders are usually internal stakeholders, are those that engage in economic transactions with the business (for example stockholders, customers, suppliers, creditors, and employees). 
*Secondary stakeholders are usually external stakeholders, although they do not engage in direct economic exchange with the business – are affected by or can affect its actions (for example the general public, communities, activist groups, business support groups, and the media).
*Excluded stakeholders are those such as children or the disinterested public, originally as they had no economic impact on business. Now as the concept takes an anthropocentric perspective, while some groups like the general public may be recognized as stakeholders others remain excluded. Such a perspective does not give plants, animals or even geology a voice as stakeholders, but only an instrumental value in relation to human groups or individuals.

A narrow mapping of a company&#x27;s stakeholders might identify the following stakeholders:

*Employees
*Communities
*Shareholders
*Creditors
*Investors
*Government
*Customers
*Owners
*Financiers
*Managers

A broader mapping of a company&#x27;s stakeholders may also include:

*Suppliers
*Distributors
*Labor unions
*Government regulatory agencies
*Government legislative bodies
*Government tax-collecting agencies
*Industry trade groups
*Professional associations
*NGOs and other advocacy groups
*Prospective employees
*Prospective customers
*Local communities
*National communities
*Public at Large (Global Community)
*Competitors
*Schools
*Future generations
*Analysts and Media
*Research centers

==In corporate responsibility==

In the field of corporate governance and corporate responsibility, a debate is ongoing about whether the firm or company should be managed primarily for stakeholders, stockholders (shareholders), customers, or others. Proponents in favor of stakeholders may base their arguments on the following four key assertions:
# Value can best be created by trying to maximize joint outcomes. For example, according to this thinking, programs that satisfy both employees&#x27; needs and stockholders&#x27; wants are doubly valuable because they address two legitimate sets of stakeholders at the same time. There is evidence that the combined effects of such a policy are not only additive but even multiplicative. For instance, by simultaneously addressing customer wishes in addition to employee and stockholder interests, both of the latter two groups also benefit from increased sales.
# Supporters also take issue with the preeminent role given to stockholders by many business thinkers, especially in the past. The argument is that debt holders, employees, and suppliers also make contributions and thus also take risks in creating a successful firm.
# These normative arguments would matter little if stockholders (shareholders) had complete control in guiding the firm. However, many believe that due to certain kinds of board of directors structures, top managers like CEOs are mostly in control of the firm.
# The greatest value of a company is its image and brand. By attempting to fulfill the needs and wants of many different people ranging from the local population and customers to their own employees and owners, companies can prevent damage to their image and brand, prevent losing large amounts of sales and disgruntled customers, and prevent costly legal expenses. While the stakeholder view has an increased cost, many firms have decided that the concept improves their image, increases sales, reduces the risks of liability for corporate negligence, and makes them less likely to be targeted by pressure groups, campaigning groups and NGOs.

A corporate stakeholder can affect or be affected by the actions of a business as a whole. Whereas shareholders are often the party with the most direct and obvious interest in business decisions, they are one of various subsets of stakeholders, as customers and employees also have in the outcome. In the most developed sense of stakeholders in terms of real corporate responsibility, the bearers of externalities are included in stakeholdership.

==In management==
In the last decades of the 20th century, the word &quot;stakeholder&quot; became more commonly used to mean a person or organization that has a legitimate interest in a project or entity. In discussing the decision-making process for institutions—including large business corporations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations—the concept has been broadened to include everyone with an interest (or &quot;stake&quot;) in what the entity does. This includes not only vendors, employees, and customers, but even members of a community where its offices or factory may affect the local economy or environment. In this context, a &quot;stakeholder&quot; includes not only the directors or trustees on its governing board (who are stakeholders in the traditional sense of the word) but also all persons who paid into the figurative stake and the persons to whom it may be &quot;paid out&quot; (in the sense of a &quot;payoff&quot; in game theory, meaning the outcome of the transaction). Therefore, in order to effectively engage with a community of stakeholders, the organisation&#x27;s management needs to be aware of the stakeholders, understand their wants and expectations, understand their attitude (supportive, neutral or opposed), and be able to prioritize the members of the overall community to focus the organisation&#x27;s scarce resources on the most significant stakeholders.

Example

*For example, in the case of a professional landlord undertaking the refurbishment of some rented housing that is occupied while the work is being carried out, key stakeholders would be the residents, neighbors (for whom the work is a nuisance), and the tenancy-management team and housing-maintenance team employed by the landlord. Other stakeholders would be funders and the design-and-construction team.

The holders of each separate kind of interest in the entity&#x27;s affairs are called a &quot;constituency,&quot; so there may be a constituency of stockholders, a constituency of adjoining property owners, a constituency of banks the entity owes money to, and so on. In that usage, &quot;constituent&quot; is a synonym for &quot;stakeholder&quot;.

==Stakeholder theory==

Post, Preston, Sachs (2002), use the following definition of the term &quot;stakeholder&quot;:
&quot;A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in an organization.
Stakeholders can affect or be affected by the organization&#x27;s actions, objectives and policies. Some examples of key stakeholders are creditors, directors, employees, government (and its agencies), owners (shareholders), suppliers, unions, and the community from which the business draws its resources.

Not all stakeholders are equal. A company&#x27;s customers are entitled to fair trading practices but they are not entitled to the same consideration as the company&#x27;s employees. The stakeholders in a corporation are the individuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to its wealth-creating capacity and activities, and that are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers.&quot; This definition differs from the older definition of the term stakeholder in Stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1983) that also includes competitors as stakeholders of a corporation. Robert Allen Phillips provides a moral foundation for stakeholder theory in &quot;Stakeholder Theory and Organizational Ethics&quot;. There he defends a &quot;principle of stakeholder fairness&quot; based on the work of John Rawls, as well as a distinction between normative and derivative legitimate stakeholders. Real stakeholders, labelled stakeholders: genuine stakeholders with a legitimate stake, the loyal partners who strive for mutual benefits. Stake owners own and deserve a stake in the firm. Stakeholder reciprocity could be an innovative criterion in the corporate governance debate as to who should be accorded representation on the board. Corporate social responsibility should imply a corporate stakeholder responsibility.

<text>Sant&#x27;Erasmo is an island in the Venetian Lagoon lying north-east of the Lido island and east of Venice, Italy.

==History==

The island was a port attached to Murano in the 8th century, but is now known for market gardening. Ruined fortifications, including the so-called &quot;Torre Massimiliana&quot; (Tower of Maximilian), ring the isle. Forts existed in the island as early as the 16th century. After the fall of the Republic of Venice, the French built here a stronghold in 1811–1814. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the Austrian Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este had a tower built here in 1843–1844, and also found here refuge during a revolt. The tower has a polygonal base of 25 m and is surrounded by a ditch. On the upper floor up to 13 cannons could be housed. It was used by the Italian Army as late as World War I.

==Today==
An annual boat race takes place during the summer. Sant&#x27;Erasmo is also known for the waders on sand banks in the lagoon surrounding it. The beach on the island&#x27;s Southernmost point, the Spiaggia del Bacan, is a popular summer destination with local Venetians. The island is accessed on Actv waterbus line 13 (Fondamente Nove-Murano-Vignole-Lazzaretto Nuovo-Sant&#x27;Erasmo-Treporti) and is also served by a night service.

<text>A cenote ( ; ) is a natural pit, or sinkhole, resulting when a collapse of limestone bedrock exposes groundwater. The term originated on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, where the ancient Maya commonly used cenotes for water supplies, and occasionally for sacrificial offerings. The name derives from a word used by the lowland Yucatec Maya——to refer to any location with accessible groundwater.

In Mexico the Yucatán Peninsula alone has an estimated 10,000 cenotes, water-filled sinkholes naturally formed by the collapse of limestone, and located across the peninsula. Some of these cenotes are at risk from the construction of the new tourist Maya Train.

Cenotes are common geological forms in low-altitude regions, particularly on islands (such as Cefalonia, Greece), coastlines, and platforms with young post-Paleozoic limestone with little soil development. The term &quot;cenote&quot;, originally applying only to the features in Yucatán, has since been applied by researchers to similar karst features in other places such as in Cuba, Australia, Europe, and the United States.

==Definition and description==

Cenotes are surface connections to subterranean water bodies. While the best-known cenotes are large open-water pools measuring tens of meters in diameter, such as those at Chichen Itza in Mexico, the greatest number of cenotes are smaller sheltered sites and do not necessarily have any surface exposed water. Some cenotes are only found through small &lt;1 m (3 ft) diameter holes created by tree roots, with human access through enlarged holes, such as the cenotes Choo-Ha, Tankach-Ha, and Multum-Ha near Tulum. There are at least 6,000 cenotes in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Cenote water is often very clear, as the water comes from rain water filtering slowly through the ground, and therefore contains very little suspended particulate matter. The groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow. In many cases, cenotes are areas where sections of the cave roof have collapsed revealing an underlying cave system, and the water flow rates may be much faster: up to per day.

The Yucatan cenotes attract cavern and cave divers who have documented extensive flooded cave systems, some of which have been explored for lengths of or more.

==Geology and hydrology==
Cenotes are formed by the dissolution of rock and the resulting subsurface void, which may or may not be linked to an active cave system, and the subsequent structural collapse. Rock that falls into the water below is slowly removed by further dissolution, creating space for more collapse blocks. Likely, the rate of collapse increases during periods when the water table is below the ceiling of the void since the rock ceiling is no longer buoyantly supported by the water in the void.

Cenotes may be fully collapsed, creating an open water pool, or partially collapsed with some portion of a rock overhanging above the water. The stereotypical cenotes often resemble small circular ponds, measuring some tens of meters in diameter with sheer rock walls. Most cenotes, however, require some degree of stooping or crawling to access the water.

===Penetration and extent===

In the north and northwest of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, the cenotes generally overlie vertical voids penetrating below the modern water table. However, very few of these cenotes appear to be connected with horizontally extensive underground river systems, with water flow through them being more likely dominated by aquifer matrix and fracture flows.

In contrast, the cenotes along the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán Peninsula (within the state of Quintana Roo) often provide access to extensive underwater cave systems, such as Sistema Ox Bel Ha, Sistema Sac Actun/Sistema Nohoch Nah Chich and Sistema Dos Ojos.

===Freshwater/seawater interface===
The Yucatán Peninsula contains a vast coastal aquifer system, which is typically density-stratified. The infiltrating meteoric water (i.e., rainwater) floats on top of higher-density saline water intruding from the coastal margins. The whole aquifer is therefore an anchialine system (one that is land-locked but connected to an ocean). Where a cenote, or the flooded cave to which it is an opening, provides deep enough access into the aquifer, the interface between the fresh and saline water may be reached. The density interface between the fresh and saline waters is a halocline, which means a sharp change in salt concentration over a small change in depth. Mixing of the fresh and saline water results in a blurry swirling effect caused by refraction between the different densities of fresh and saline waters.

The depth of the halocline is a function of several factors: climate and specifically how much meteoric water recharges the aquifer, hydraulic conductivity of the host rock, distribution and connectivity of existing cave systems, and how effective these are at draining water to the coast, and the distance from the coast. In general, the halocline is deeper further from the coast, and in the Yucatán Peninsula this depth is below the water table at the coast, and below the water table in the middle of the peninsula, with saline water underlying the whole of the peninsula.
===Types===
In 1936, a simple morphometry-based classification system for cenotes was presented.
* Cenotes-cántaro (Jug or pit cenotes) are those with a surface connection narrower than the diameter of the water body;
* Cenotes-cilíndricos (Cylinder cenotes) are those with strictly vertical walls;
* Cenotes-aguadas (Basin cenotes) are those with shallow water basins; and
* Grutas (Cave cenotes) are those having a horizontal entrance with dry sections.

The classification scheme was based on morphometric observations above the water table, and therefore incompletely reflects the processes by which the cenotes formed and the inherent hydrogeochemical relationship with the underlying flooded cave networks, which were only discovered in the 1980s and later with the initiation of cave diving exploration.

== Flora and fauna ==
Flora and fauna are generally scarcer than in the open ocean; however, marine animals do thrive in caves. In caverns, one can spot mojarras, mollies, guppies, catfish, small eels and frogs. In the most secluded and darker cenotes, the fauna has evolved to resemble those of many cave-dwelling species. For example, many animals don&#x27;t have pigmentation and are often blind, so they are equipped with long feelers to find food and make their way around in the dark.

==Chicxulub crater==
Although cenotes are found widely throughout much of the Yucatán Peninsula, a higher-density circular alignment of cenotes overlies the measured rim of the Chicxulub crater. This crater structure, identified from the alignment of cenotes, but also subsequently mapped using geophysical methods (including gravity mapping) and also drilled into with core recovery, has been dated to the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene geologic periods, 66 million years ago. This meteorite impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary is therefore associated with the mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and is also known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

==Archaeology and anthropology==
In 2001–2002 expeditions led by Arturo H. González and Carmen Rojas Sandoval in the Yucatán discovered three human skeletons; one of them, Eve of Naharon, was carbon-dated to be 13,600 years old. In March 2008, three members of the &quot;Proyecto Espeleológico de Tulum&quot; and Global Underwater Explorers dive team, Alex Alvarez, Franco Attolini, and Alberto Nava, explored a section of &quot;Sistema Aktun Hu&quot; (part of Sistema Sac Actun) known as the pit &quot;Hoyo Negro&quot;. At a depth of the divers located the remains of a mastodon and a human skull (at ) that might be the oldest evidence of human habitation in the region.

The Yucatán Peninsula has almost no rivers and only a few lakes, and those are often marshy. The widely distributed cenotes are the only perennial source of potable water and have long been the principal source of water in much of the region. Major Maya settlements required access to adequate water supplies, and therefore cities, including the famous Chichen Itza, were built around these natural wells. Many cenotes like the Sacred Cenote in Chichen Itza played an important role in Maya rites. The Maya believed that cenotes were portals to Xibalba or the afterlife, and home to the rain god, Chaac. The Maya often deposited human remains as well as ceremonial artifacts in these cenotes.

The discovery of golden sacrificial artifacts in some cenotes led to the archaeological exploration of most cenotes in the first part of the 20th century. Edward Herbert Thompson (1857–1935), an American diplomat who had bought the Chichen Itza site, began dredging the Sacred Cenote there in 1904. He discovered human skeletons and sacrificial objects confirming a local legend, the Cult of the Cenote, involving human sacrifice to the rain god Chaac by the ritual casting of victims and objects into the cenote. However, not all cenotes were sites of human sacrifice. The cenote at Punta Laguna has been extensively studied and none of the approximately 120 individuals show signs of sacrifice. 
The remains of this cultural heritage are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.

== Scuba diving ==

Cenotes have attracted cavern and cave divers, and there are organized efforts to explore and map these underwater systems. They are public or private and sometimes considered &quot;National Natural Parks&quot;. Great care should be taken to avoid spoiling this fragile ecosystem when diving. In Mexico, the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey maintains a list of the longest and deepest water-filled and dry caves within the state boundaries. When cavern diving, one must be able to see natural light the entire time that one is exploring the cavern (e.g., Kukulkan cenote near Tulum, Mexico). During a cave dive, one passes the point where daylight can penetrate, and one follows a safety guideline to exit the cave. Things change quite dramatically once moving from a cavern dive into a cave dive.

Contrary to cenote cavern diving, cenote cave diving requires special equipment and training (certification for cave diving). However, both cavern and cave diving require detailed briefings, diving experience, and weight adjustment to freshwater buoyancy. The cenotes are usually filled with rather cool fresh water. Cenote divers must be wary of possible halocline; this produces blurred vision until they reach a more homogeneous area.

<text>The Gemini Contenders is a 1976 novel by Robert Ludlum.

==Plot introduction==
At the start of World War II a train departs from Salonika and heads for the Italian Alps, carrying a mysterious cargo. Over the next four decades, various members of the wealthy Italian Fontini-Cristi family, and a small brotherhood of priests with the name Xenope, struggle to locate and control the deadly secret cargo.

==Plot summary==

===The Train from Salonika===
In 1939, Savarone Fontini-Cristi is the &quot;padrone&quot; of an immensely wealthy and powerful Italian family. At this time, the Order of Xenope, a secretive Greek monastic brotherhood, possesses ancient religious manuscripts, some of which, if authentic, are considered to be of enough significance to shatter the Christian religion. The Order of Xenope knows that the Nazis and Italian Fascists are seeking these long-rumored documents, and so must hide them. Because of his stature as a man of unsurpassed integrity, the Order entrusts the custody of these holiest of relics to Fontini-Cristi. Savarone schedules the circuitous shipment by train from Salonika, through Yugoslavia and Italy, and finally into the Alps. If the contents of the shipment are discovered at any time, the consequences are explosive.

===The Executions===
Though extremely wealthy, Savarone Fontini-Cristi has grown to abhor the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. He actively supports the &quot;partigiani&quot;, the disorganized Communist opposition to Mussolini. Savarone&#x27;s involvement with the train from Salonika becomes known to the powerful Roman Catholic Cardinal, Donatti, who must have the hidden documents at any cost.

Incorrectly believing that Savarone has shared the secret location of the vault containing the documents with his first-born son, 36-year-old playboy Vittorio, Cardinal Donatti orders the execution of the entire Fontini-Cristi family at the family compound Campo di Fiori, just outside Milan. The family&#x27;s massacre by an execution squad, consisting of German soldiers overseen by Donatti, is secretly witnessed by Vittorio, who can hardly believe the horror - father, mother, brothers, wives, children - all murdered in front of his eyes.

===World War II===
To Vittorio Fontini-Cristi&#x27;s surprise, the British take extraordinary steps to evacuate Vittorio from Italy, expecting that he will tell them of the vault&#x27;s location. Unfortunately for them, he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the train from Salonika or its contents.

The British take advantage of Vittorio&#x27;s business skills during World War II, establishing a covert network of displaced European professionals, whose purpose is to discreetly sabotage the business processes of the German war machine: Shipping fiascos and printing mistakes, resulting in mild chaos in the back office of the war effort. The British decided to anglicize his name to Victor Fontine. Throughout the war, periodic incidents arise related to the hidden documents that put Victor&#x27;s life, and the life of Jane, his new-found bride, in danger. In June 1942, in the midst of a German bombing related to the vault, Jane gives birth to twins, whom she calls her Geminis. Victor vows that, immediately after the war, he will put the mystery of Salonika behind him, and convince his pursuers that he knows nothing about it.

At the war&#x27;s end, he returns to Campo di Fiori, site of the execution grounds, where he hopes to end his involvement with the documents. After barely escaping with his life, he is met at the gates by five zealous priests, including the despised Cardinal Donatti. Proclaiming for the hundredth time that his father never told him about the train, Donatti orders Victor to be tortured until he confesses. Since Victor knows nothing, the priests torture him by breaking every single bone in his body, finally administering the last rites, and leaving him to die.

===1973===
Having barely survived the torture, Victor sells all of his holdings in Italy and establishes an extremely successful post-war consulting business in America. His twin sons, Adrian and Andrew, have grown up with privilege, with Adrian attending Princeton and Harvard Law, while Andrew, a West Point graduate, is a Major in the Vietnam War.

The sons are on opposite sides of the Vietnam War, but Andrew has grown into a sociopathic man, for whom the end justifies the means. Adrian is on the verge of exposing some of the crimes that his brother, and his cabal of elite officers, have committed.

At the same time, Victor is alarmed to learn that the train from Salonika has leaped through the past 30 years in the form of one of the zealous priests, who vows that Victor knows where the documents are and that he will force Victor to tell him. Remembering comments and gestures by his murdered father, the 70-year-old Victor travels back to Campo de&#x27; Fiori, and discovers key clues to the vault&#x27;s location. The priest observes Victor&#x27;s discovery, and attempts to pick up the torture where it was left off back in 1945. Badly injured, Victor returns to America to charge his Geminis with the responsibility of locating the hidden documents, realizing only that the sons have grown apart, but not that Andrew should not have such crucial information to be used for ill purposes.

Killing anyone who gets in his way, Andrew pursues the Salonika documents, leaving Adrian far behind. Adrian knows his brother&#x27;s nature, and that he cannot be allowed to have the documents that could cause the collapse of Christianity, and the worldwide chaos that would ensue.

===Brother vs. brother===
In Champoluc a little town in the Aosta Valley, Adrian catches up with the murderous Andrew just as Andrew discovers the vault. In a monumental struggle, Adrian righteously triumphs over his evil twin brother, leaving Adrian to have the documents interpreted and to decide what to do with them.

===The Documents===
A parchment was taken from a Roman prison cell in the year 65 A.D. It is a letter supposedly written by a prisoner named Simon Bethsaida, renamed Peter by Jesus. In the letter, the author claims that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but instead another prisoner was substituted. Jesus allegedly committed suicide three days after the incident.

<doc id="985531" wikidata="Q737062" url="?curid=985531" title="Olympia (Manet)">
<text>Olympia is an 1863 oil painting by Édouard Manet, depicting a nude white woman (&quot;Olympia&quot;) lying on a bed being attended to by a black maid. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by Claude Monet. The painting is now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris.

The figure of Olympia was modeled by Victorine Meurent, and that of her servant by Laure. Olympia&#x27;s confrontational gaze caused shock and controversy when the painting was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon, especially because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute.

The title of the painting is generally attributed to Manet&#x27;s close friend Zacharie Astruc, an art critic and artist, since an excerpt from one of Astruc&#x27;s poems was included in the catalogue entry along with &quot;Olympia&quot; when it was first exhibited in 1865.

== Content ==
Contemporary audiences were shocked by Olympia&#x27;s confrontational gaze, combined with details identifying her as a &quot;demi-mondaine,&quot; or courtesan. These include the fact that the name &quot;Olympia&quot; was associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.

The orchid flower in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings, the oriental shawl on which she lies, and the upright black cat are symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in contrast with her pale skin and cast-off slipper, emphasizes the voluptuous atmosphere.

The painting takes inspiration from Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (c. 1534). Whereas the left hand of Titian&#x27;s Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia&#x27;s left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her role as a prostitute, granting access to her body in return for payment. Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian&#x27;s painting with a black cat, a creature associated with nocturnal promiscuity. The aroused posture of the cat was provocative; in French, &quot;chatte&quot; (cat) is slang for female genitalia. Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, speculated by some to be a gift from one of her clients. Some have suggested that she could be looking in the direction of the door as her client barges in unannounced.

The painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, studio lighting that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces, and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of Alexandre Cabanel&#x27;s &quot;La naissance de Vénus&quot;, also painted in 1863, Olympia is portrayed as a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting. The canvas alone is 130.5 × 190 cm (51.4 × 74.8 inches), which is rather large. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time. Charles Baudelaire thought thinness was more indecent than fatness.

The model for Olympia, Victorine Meurent, would have been recognized by viewers of the painting because she was well known in Paris circles. She started modeling when she was sixteen years old and she also was an accomplished painter in her own right. Some of her paintings were exhibited in the Paris Salon. The familiarity with the identity of the model was a major reason this painting was considered shocking to viewers. A well known woman currently living in modern-day Paris could not simultaneously represent a historical or mythological woman.

== Critical reaction ==

Though Manet&#x27;s &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; (&quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;) had sparked controversy in 1863, his &quot;Olympia&quot; stirred an even bigger uproar when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Conservatives condemned the work as &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;vulgar&quot;. Journalist Antonin Proust later recalled, &quot;If the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration.&quot; The critics and the public condemned the work alike. Even Émile Zola was reduced to disingenuously commenting on the work&#x27;s formal qualities rather than acknowledging the subject matter: &quot;You wanted a nude, and you chose Olympia, the first that came along&quot;. He paid tribute to Manet&#x27;s honesty, however: &quot;When our artists give us Venuses, they correct nature, they lie. Édouard Manet asked himself why lie, why not tell the truth; he introduced us to Olympia, this &quot;fille&quot; of our time, whom you meet on the sidewalks.&quot;

=== Olympia&#x27;s maid ===

Although originally overlooked, the figure of the maid in the painting, modelled by a woman named Laure, has become a topic of discussion among contemporary scholars. As T. J. Clark recounts of a friend&#x27;s disbelief in the revised 1990 version of &quot;The Painting of Modern Life&quot;: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake! You&#x27;ve written about the white woman on the bed for fifty pages and more, and hardly mentioned the black woman alongside her!&quot; &quot;Olympia&quot; was created 15 years after slavery had been abolished in France and its empire, but negative stereotypes of black people persisted among some elements of French society. In some cases, the white prostitute in the painting was described using racially charged language. According to Marie Lathers, &quot;references to Blackness thus invaded the image of white Olympia, turning her into the caricatural and grotesque animal that Black people are frequently made to represent in the nineteenth century.&quot;

Many critics have applauded Manet in his use of white and black in the painting, an alternative to the tradition of chiaroscuro. Charles Bernheimer has responded,
According to Timothy Paul, some black feminists, including Lorraine O&#x27;Grady, have argued that it is not for artistic convention that Manet included Laure but to create an ideological binary between black and white, good and bad, clean and dirty and as such &quot;inevitably reformulates the Cartesian perspectival logic that allows whiteness to function as the only subject of consideration&quot;. When paired with a lighter skin tone, the black female model stands in as signifier to all of the racial stereotypes of the West.

==== Confrontational gaze and oppositional gaze ====
In Lorraine O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s essay &quot;Olympia&#x27;s Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity&quot;, she asserts, &quot;Olympia&#x27;s maid, like all other &#x27;peripheral Negroes, is a robot conveniently made to disappear into the background drapery. While the confrontational gaze of Olympia is often referenced as the pinnacle of defiance toward patriarchy, the oppositional gaze of Olympia&#x27;s maid is ignored; she is part of the background with little to no attention given to the critical role of her presence.

O&#x27;Grady points out that we know she represents &#x27;Jezebel and Mammy&#x27; &quot;and best of all, she is not a real person&quot;, rather she is object to the objectified and excluded from sexual difference according to Freudian theory. While Olympia looks directly at the viewer, her maid, too, is looking back. In her essay &quot;Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and Their Homegirls: Developing an Oppositional Gaze toward the Images of Black Women&quot;, Catherine West concludes that by claiming an oppositional gaze we can identify, criticize, resist and transform these and other oppressive images of black women.

=== Events ===
In January 2016, a Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis, lay on the floor in front of the painting nude and mimicked the pose of the subject. She was arrested for indecent exposure.

From September 2023 to January 2024, the painting was included in the exhibition &quot;Manet/Degas&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

== Precedents ==
In part, the painting was inspired by Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (c. 1534), which in turn derives from Giorgione&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Venus&quot; (c. 1510). The Titian has two fully clothed women, presumably servants, in the background. Léonce Bénédite was the first art historian to explicitly acknowledge the similarity to the &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; in 1897. There is also some similarity to Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;La maja desnuda&quot; (c. 1800).

There were also pictorial precedents for a nude white female, often pictured with a black female servant, such as Léon Benouville&#x27;s &quot;Esther with Odalisque&quot; (1844), Ingres&#x27; &quot;Odalisque with a Slave&quot; (1842), and Charles Jalabert&#x27;s &quot;Odalisque&quot; (1842). Comparison is also made to Ingres&#x27; &quot;Grande Odalisque&quot; (1814). Manet did not depict a goddess or an odalisque but a high-class prostitute waiting for a client; it has often been argued that Titian did the same.

<doc id="985535" wikidata="Q1057833" url="?curid=985535" title="World Tag Team Championship (WWE, 1971–2010)">
<text>The 1971 to 2010 version of the World Tag Team Championship was the original professional wrestling world tag team championship in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) promotion, and the company&#x27;s third tag team championship overall. Originally established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on June 3, 1971 (renamed World Wrestling Federation/WWF in 1979), it served as the only title for tag teams in the promotion until the then-WWF bought World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001, which added the WCW Tag Team Championship. Both titles were unified in November 2001, retiring WCW&#x27;s championship and continuing WWF&#x27;s.

In 2002, the company was renamed WWE. Following the introduction of the WWE brand extension, where wrestlers and championships became exclusive to a WWE brand, the World Tag Team Championship became exclusive to the Raw brand, while a second WWE Tag Team Championship (currently known as the World Tag Team Championship as of April 2024) was established for the SmackDown! brand. Both titles were unified in 2009 into the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, but remained independently active until the original World Tag Team Championship was decommissioned in 2010 in favor of continuing the newer championship.

The championship was contested in professional wrestling matches. Bouts for the title headlined WWF events including In Your House 3, Fully Loaded: In Your House, and 2001&#x27;s Backlash. The inaugural champions were the team of Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler, and the final champions were The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd).

== History ==
===Origins===
When the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) formed in 1963, their first tag team championship was the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, which was originally an NWA championship established in 1958 and used by the WWWF&#x27;s predecessor, Capitol Wrestling Corporation. After then-WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino and his tag team partner Spiros Arion won the titles in 1967, the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship was abandoned and deactivated due to Sammartino being the world champion. Two years later, The Rising Suns (Toru Tanaka and Mitsu Arakawa) arrived in the WWWF with the WWWF International Tag Team Championship, which they claimed to have won in a tournament in Tokyo in June of that year. This became the WWWF&#x27;s tag team title until 1971 when The Rising Suns left the WWWF and took the titles with them.

The WWWF then established their own original world tag team championship, the WWWF World Tag Team Championship in 1971. Following the title&#x27;s introduction, Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler became the inaugural champions on June 3. In 1979, the title became known as the &quot;WWF Tag Team Championship&quot; when the promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was subsequently renamed WWF World Tag Team Championship in 1983, but was often referred to as the WWF Tag Team Championship for short.

In March 2001, the WWF purchased the selected assets of rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from AOL Time Warner and its championships were now also defended on WWF programming. Soon after, The Invasion took place in which the WCW/ECW Alliance was ultimately dismantled. The title was temporarily unified for the first time at SummerSlam when WCW Tag Team Champions Kane and The Undertaker defeated WWF Tag Team Champions Chris Kanyon and Diamond Dallas Page in a title-for-title steel cage match. Both titles remained independently active during this reign. At Survivor Series, the title was unified again with the WCW Tag Team Championship in another title-for-title steel cage match when WCW Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz defeated WWF Tag Team Champions The Hardy Boyz. This time, the WCW Tag Team Championship was deactivated with The Dudley Boyz recognized as the final champions and they reigned as the new WWF Tag Team Champions.

===Brand split and unification===
After the WWF/WWE name change in 2002, the championship was subsequently renamed &quot;WWE Tag Team Championship&quot;. During the initial WWE brand extension, the WWE Tag Team Championship was assigned to the SmackDown! brand as the reigning champions at the time of the initial expansion, Billy and Chuck, were both drafted to SmackDown! together. In July of that year, shortly after defeating Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Edge for the titles, the reigning champion team of Lance Storm and Christian (The Un-Americans) left SmackDown! for Raw, leaving SmackDown! without a tag team title. As a result, then-SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon commissioned a new tag team title, also called the WWE Tag Team Championship, to be the exclusive tag team titles for the SmackDown! brand. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship on the Raw brand after the WWE Championship became exclusive to SmackDown!, the WWE Tag Team Championship on Raw was renamed &quot;World Tag Team Championship&quot;. This was done so that the names of both tag team titles would mirror the names of the top championships on their respective brands. When the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship switched brands during the 2005 WWE draft lottery, however, neither of the tag team titles were renamed.

In late 2008 through early 2009, WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) engaged in rivalry with World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and the Miz, with the two teams exchanging victories in non-title matches and retaining their respective titles against each other. On the March 17 episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot;, it was announced that at WrestleMania 25, both teams would defend their titles against each other and the winning team would hold both titles. The Colóns defeated Morrison and Miz, and thus unified the titles into the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, although both championships remained independently active.

As the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, the champions could appear and defend the titles on any WWE brand, regardless of the brand that the holders belonged to. On August 16, 2010, the World Tag Team Championship was decommissioned in favor of continuing the lineage of the WWE Tag Team Championship (which dropped the &quot;unified&quot; moniker) with Bret Hart presenting new championship belts to the final World Tag Team Champions, The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd). In April 2024, the WWE Tag Team Championship, which had been renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship in 2016, took on the World Tag Team Championship name.

== Brand designation history ==
Following the events of the WWE brand extension, an annual WWE draft was established, in which select members of the WWE roster were reassigned to a different brand. After the World Tag Team Championship was unified with the WWE Tag Team Championship as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, the champions could appear and defend the titles on any WWE brand.

== Belt designs ==
The original WWWF World Tag Team Championship design is similar to the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship but with one side plate on each side and a more squared center piece plus different wording minus the words United States and having the words WWWF World replace and slightly taller and thicker leather and different in the middle gold and medal designings.

The second WWWF World Tag Team Championship design is similar to the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championships, but to represent difference the leather of the title is dark blue other than red and it has the word world at the top instead of the word lady.

The third WWF World Tag Team championship design to year 2002 was gold and had a gold center plate with two gold side plates on each side. The center plate is square shaped with a light blue world in the middle of it with gold outlining&#x27;s in it with the word world that&#x27;s red in the middle of it that also has gold outlining with the words tag team wrestling champions at the bottom of it in very fancy designing with the letter &quot;W&quot; representing WWE at the top with a red slanted lining at the bottom of it. The side plates of the title are upward tall rectangular shaped with two men wrestling outlined in gold in the center also with the letter w representing WWE at the top with a red slanted lining at the bottom of it and the leather was black. At one time the belt was silver with gold outlining as well with the same design.

The 2002 to 2010 design of the World Tag Team Championships were very similar to the 2002 design, but instead of the world background in the middle of the title being blue is red and the words tag team at the top and the word champions at the bottom to represent a more hardcore heavyweight historical difference.

== Reigns ==
The inaugural champions were Crazy Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler, who defeated Dick the Bruiser and The Sheik on June 3, 1971. The record for longest reign was held by Demolition, whose first reign lasted 478 days. Three teams tied for a record with shortest reigns. Jules Strongbow and Chief Jay Strongbow had their titles taken away shortly after winning them on June 28, 1982 when it was determined that Mr. Fuji, one half of the reigning champions with Mr. Saito, was pinned with a foot on the ropes. Owen Hart and Yokozuna lost their titles on September 25, 1995, to the Smoking Gunns shortly after having the titles returned to them. On March 19, 2001, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz to win the titles only to lose them later that night to The Dudley Boyz.

The Dudley Boyz held the record for most reigns as a team with eight. Edge held the record for overall reigns as an individual with 12, seven with Christian. He also won the titles with Hulk Hogan, Chris Benoit, Randy Orton, and Chris Jericho (after the titles were unified).

The final champions were The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd), who won the titles from ShoMiz (Big Show and The Miz) on the April 26, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. After the World Tag Team Championship was deactivated, the duo continued to serve as the WWE Tag Team Champions until their loss at Night of Champions on September 19, 2010, to Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes.

<text>Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold is a 1986 American adventure comedy film directed by Gary Nelson and released in West Germany on December 18, 1986, and in the United States on January 30, 1987. It is loosely based on the 1887 novel &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; by H. Rider Haggard. It is the sequel to the 1985 film &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;.

The role of Allan Quatermain is reprised by Richard Chamberlain, as is that of Jesse Huston by Sharon Stone. Stone was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress, but lost to Madonna for &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. The film also starred James Earl Jones as Umslopogaas, Henry Silva as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, and Cassandra Peterson as Queen Sorais. Chamberlain&#x27;s then real-life partner Martin Rabbett also starred as Robeson Quatermain.

==Plot==
After surviving their expedition to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines, Allan Quatermain and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans to travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless.

A man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain&#x27;s friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him.

Before he dies, he tells Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary &#x27;Lost City of Gold&#x27;. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan.

Allan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior and old friend of Allan&#x27;s, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five Askari warriors accompany them. The group crosses a desert and reaches the Walls of Japora. Two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a boobytrap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Eshowe warriors attack the group. Many spears are thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them with his giant axe. The remaining askaris are lost in a subterranean river.

Quatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city has two queens—the noble and beloved, Nyleptha and her power-hungry sister, Sorais. But the real leader is the evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all.

Allan raises the population against Agon and Sorais, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realizes that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, Allan uses Umslopogaas&#x27; axe to channel the lightning and melt the gold, causing it to flow off the side of the structure and pour over the attacking horde, turning Agon and his army into gold statues.

==Production==
The film was made simultaneously with its predecessor, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, although it was released a couple of years later. Despite the tremendous liberties both films took with the source material, being more similar in tone to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series, &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot; was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggard&#x27;s &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, entitled simply &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;. In that book, which depicts Quatermain&#x27;s last adventure (although it is just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom.

An opulent set was constructed for the film just outside Victoria Falls.

===Music===
The film features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by Jerry Goldsmith for the first film (although Linn&#x27;s score does use Goldsmith&#x27;s main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from Cannon Films.

The score was initially released by Silva Screen in 1988 on a CD with cues from &quot;Manifesto&quot; (scored by Nicola Piovani), &quot;Making the Grade&quot; (Basil Poledouris), &quot;Doin&#x27; Time on Planet Earth&quot; (Dana Kaproff) and &quot;The Seven Magnificent Gladiators&quot; (Dov Seltzer); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records. Cues in italics contain material composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

==Release==
The film debuted at number seven at the box office during its first week, earning $2 million.

It was a box office disappointment, one of several that led to Cannon Films reporting a loss in early 1987. The other box office disappointments for the company included &quot;Assassination&quot;, &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;The Hanoi Hilton&quot;, &quot;Over the Top&quot;, &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; and &quot;Street Smart&quot;.

&quot;I know it went through town pretty fast&quot;, said Richard Chamberlain. &quot;I know my family didn&#x27;t like it much. My father was too ill to see it, but my mother said, &#x27;Richard, the advertising was all wrong. They should have told people it was funny.&#x27; But I don&#x27;t think it hurt my chances for other movies. I know a lot of people who do a lot of movies, and some of them are good and some of them aren&#x27;t. Michael Caine&#x27;s one example. He&#x27;s wonderful in some movies and forgettable in others. I think as long as you&#x27;re doing generally good work that you enjoy, things will be okay.&quot;

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 40%, based on 5 reviews.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; film critic wrote &quot; there&#x27;s nothing new under the broiling afternoon sun. It&#x27;s the same: washed-out scenery, stale dialogue and lackluster performances... Except for the presence of James Earl Jones doing a depressing turn as a native chieftain, &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; is just for folks who don&#x27;t mind mining for fool&#x27;s gold.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was &quot;of minor academic interest. Those who take the Spielberg special effects for granted are sure to learn a lot by watching these same tricks done badly... Fortunately, Richard Chamberlain is professional and then some, since the film would otherwise be virtually unwatchable.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the &quot;movie seems largely aimed at fans who can&#x27;t wait for the next installment of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot; Unfortunately, most of the battle scenes were... ineptly staged... Chamberlain has none of the breezy, irreverence that made Harrison Ford&#x27;s Indiana Jones such a delightful hero. In his Banana Republic khaki duds and a bullet-proof undershirt, he exudes the dashing spirit of a game-show host. The rest of the cast is good largely for unintentional laughs.&quot;

===Criticism of racism===
Based on a 19th-century novel that, though acceptable at its time, in retrospect may contain some racist attitudes, the film itself has been criticized for conveying some of these same racist themes. The book &quot;Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture&quot; provides a harsh critique saying it reached &quot;levels of racism unachieved since the 1930s.&quot; Though the film has been portrayed as a comedy and a satire not all critics have been satisfied that the racist themes are excused under this pretense.

==Abandoned sequels==
The Cannon Group originally planned a trilogy of films, the third film to be an adaptation of &quot;She and Allan&quot; but this was ultimately abandoned after the extreme negative reception of &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot;, coupled with the financial difficulties of the company at that time.

In 2011, a new sequel was proposed by Menahem Golan called &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East&quot;. The script was written by Golan and Richard Albiston and was to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary &quot;Golan: A Farewell to Mr Cinema&quot;, Richard Chamberlain had agreed to return as the title character but Golan died before the film began shooting.

==Home releases==
MGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004. A Blu-ray edition followed in March 2015.

<text>Grafenwöhr (, Northern Bavarian: &quot;Groafawehr&quot;) is a town in the district of Neustadt an der Waldnaab, in the region of the Upper Palatinate () in eastern Bavaria, Germany. It is widely known for the United States Army military installation and training area, called Grafenwoehr Training Area (Tower Barracks), located directly south and west of the town.

==History==

=== Early history===

The town of Grafenwöhr (Island of the Count), was founded in the 9th century on an island (wöhr), located between the river Creussen and the Thum stream. In its early history, the inhabitants and the town of Grafenwöhr proper belonged to nobles from Schweinfurt, Bamberg, and Leuchtenberg.

===20th century===

In 1907, Prince Luitpold, regent of the Kingdom of Bavaria, selected the area near the town of Grafenwöhr as the place best suited for training of the Bavarian Army (1806–1919). Construction began in 1908, and, by 1915, the training reservation was in area. The first artillery round was fired in the training area at 08:00 on 30 June 1910. Throughout World War I (1914–1918) the Grafenwöhr training area was used for equipping and training army units for combat. After the War, the High Command, Berlin, used Grafenwöhr to train the 100,000–man German army, allowed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). 

In 1936, the Nazi Government expanded the training area to the present size of . On 5 and 8 April 1945, the training camp and the town of Grafenwöhr proper were bombed during Allied air drops. The last German Army Commander of the Grafenwöhr training area surrendered to the U.S. Army on 20 April 1945. Afterwards, during the Cold War (1945–1991), the Grafenwöhr training area was an important, combined arms training site for the U.S. Army and allied forces.

===Post Cold War===

The military installation is also home to one of the largest Army construction projects in Europe, called Efficient Basing-Grafenwöhr. The Grafenwöhr Training Area (Tower Barracks) houses the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command (JMTC). The 7th Army JMTC owns almost all of the U.S. Army training facilities and assets in Europe. The Grafenwöhr Training Area is one of its largest training areas and includes ranges that can accommodate nearly every weapons system currently used. 

Though operated by the U.S. Army, the area is the largest multinational training area in Europe. Grafenwöhr Training Area is (Tower Barracks), also known as the East Camp, is the main post and is located on the north east edge of the training area. The Vilseck military community, also known as Rose Barracks, or the South Camp, is on the southern boundary.

The Grafenwöhr Army Airfield provides air flow to all air traffic requesting services including but not limited C-130&#x27;s from the 37th Airlift Squadron at Ramstein AB, Germany. The airfield is staffed 24 hours a day by advisory services and at a minimum from 08:00 to 17:00 by air traffic controllers both in a control tower and an approach control. Due to its length and relative proximity to the JMTC training area, it makes for a realistic simulation of short field operations encountered around the world. Bunker dropzone is also located within the Grafenwöhr Training Area. It is used to practice airdrop of troops, equipment, and supplies.

<text>Economic militarism is the ideology surrounding the use of military expenditure to prop up an economy, or the use of military power to gain control or access to territory or other economic resources.
Thus a link between output and military expenditure can be made. The scope of this effect depend on : threat faced, productivity of factors, degree of the military utilisation, finance method of military spending, its externalities and effectiveness of this military spending in countering the treaty. As a consequence, a same amount of military spending in different countries can have wide-ranging effects.

==Brief history of the term==
The first important use dates from 1939 with &quot;Germany Rampant: A Study in Economic Militarism&quot; by Ernest Hambloch, a long-serving British diplomat. &quot;Germany Rampant&quot; &quot;traces the philosophy of Nazism to the German mythological figures of ancient times.&quot;

Since this book the term has been used in connection with the ancient Aztecs, and with militaristic movements in a variety of cultures, and applies to the ideological and cultural aspects of a state, society or group that sustain the drive for hegemony or empire. For example, Joseph Kenney applies the term to the Almoravids.

In 2003 Clyde Prestowitz, of the Economic Strategy Institute published a book containing his analysis of what he called economic militarism in American foreign policy, that was reviewed in The Economist magazine.

==Demand effect==
Military expenditure can impact the economy of a country and its growth through the demand effect. An increase of military spending, will increase the prosperity of the country and its employment rate, thanks to a rise of demand. It is link to the Keynesian multiplier effect, introduced by Richard Kahn in the 1930s, that states that every exogenous rise in government expenditure will decrease unemployment and increase growth, no matter the form of expenditure. However, the extent of this effect, and some potential others, will depend on the way this expenditure will be financed (see War finance).

Changes in the industrial output will also appear when military expenditure is increased. This effect can be explained thanks to the Input-output model.

==Supply effect==
As previously said, an increase of military expenditure can change the industrial output thanks to the input-output effect, but it as a consequence, also modifies the input. Factors of production such as labor force, natural resources or capital can be heavily changed when the government has the desire to increase its military capacity. Some resources previously used by civilians or by other branches of production are transferred to the military field. This could destroy profoundly resources of a country (especially during war times). Research and development(R&amp;D) investments can also be made to improve the military capacity of production. It could then have positive impacts on other production fields. Moreover, more workers will be employed, which might reduce the unemployment rate, but this might also reduce their productive when they will return to a non-military sector of employment, or the unemployment rate could rise again dramatically when the military use will decrease. 
As a consequence, an increase of military expenditure can create a large variety of economic impacts and externalities, positives and/or negatives (see also: Externality).

==Security effect==
In order to invest and innovate, agents should be confident in the economic, its well-being and as a consequence, in the security of persons. During war times or in cases of foreign threats, military expenditure could enable to increase security, maintain the market operations and thus increase output. Indeed, if you look at the world dynamic of military spendings over time, you can clearly identify a positive relation between war or war threat and spendings ; for example during the First World War, The Second World War and the Cold War.

However, in some situations military expenditure is rather use to increase exponentially the military industrial complex and to threaten other nations (as it was the case during the Cold War), and can lead to dangerous arms races.

<text>MV &quot;Empire MacAlpine&quot; was a grain ship converted to become the first Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship).

The Burntisland Shipbuilding Company, Fife, Scotland, built her under order from the Ministry of War Transport and was delivered on 14 April 1943. As a MAC ship, only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel. She was operated by William Thomson &amp; Co (the Ben Line).

After the war she was converted to a grain carrier. She was scrapped in Hong Kong in 1970.

<doc id="985555" wikidata="Q5153505" url="?curid=985555" title="Common Wealth Party">
<text>The Common Wealth Party (CW) was a socialist political party in the United Kingdom with parliamentary representation in the House of Commons from 1942 (the middle of the Second World War) until 1946. Thereafter CW continued to function, essentially as a pressure group, until 1993.

==The war years==
Common Wealth was founded on 26 July 1942 in World War II by the alliance of two left-wing groups: the 1941 Committee – a think tank centred on &quot;Picture Post&quot; owner Edward G. Hulton and its &#x27;star&#x27; writers J.B. Priestley and Spanish Civil War veteran Tom Wintringham; and the neo-Christian &quot;Forward March movement&quot; led by Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Richard Acland, along with independents such as the industrialist and designer Robert Dudley Best and former Liberals who believed that the party had no direction. It aimed to be more appealing to Labour&#x27;s potential voters than those leaning towards Conservatism.

Common Wealth stood for three principles: Common Ownership, Morality in Politics and Vital Democracy. Disagreeing with the electoral pact established with other parties in the wartime coalition, key figures in the 1941 Committee began sponsoring independent candidates in by-elections under the banner of the Nine Point Group.

Following the electoral success of Tom Driberg with this support in 1942, the Committee, a social movement, proposed becoming a political party through a merger with Forward March, though many preferred movement status. Through pressure from Priestley and Wintringham, &#x27;Party&#x27; was never formally part of Common Wealth&#x27;s name. The group was led by Acland (MP), Vernon Bartlett, J.B. Priestley, and Tom Wintringham. Its programme of common ownership echoed that of the Labour Party but had more idealistic perspective, later termed &quot;libertarian socialist&quot;. It came to reject the State-dominated form of socialism adopted by Labour under the influence of Beatrice and Sidney Webb, aligning itself instead with co-operative, syndicalist and guild socialist traditions. A party proposal became that personal income, by taxation, should have an upper limit.

Though the party was initially chaired by Priestley, he stepped down after just a few months, unable to reconcile himself with the politics of Acland – who as a sitting MP he viewed as exerting undue influence. Wintringham was the natural successor but deferred to Acland, despite very real political differences between them.

Acland himself had a less easy-going approach. In his book &quot;The Forward March&quot; he had claimed that in Britain under a Forward March government:

&quot;[it is]&quot; the community as a whole which must decide whether or not a man shall be employed upon our resources, and how and when and in what manner he shall work ...&quot;[the community will]&quot; run camps for shirkers on very tolerable conditions.

Acland went on to say of these camps:

[Hitler] has stumbled across (or has needed to make use of) a small part, or perhaps one should say one particular aspect of, what will ultimately be required of humanity.

These differences, which led to Priestley stepping down from the leadership and his gradual withdrawal from the party (though he continued to support and endorse individual candidates), were a source of continued tension between former 1941 Committee and Nine Point Group members on one side and Forward Marchers and Christian Socialists on the other.

These differences in approach within Common Wealth were highlighted in a 1944 booklet by Tom and Kitty Wintringham entitled &quot;Fellowship or Morality?&quot;. Wintringham encouraged C. A. Smith to become party chairman, the two having been brought together for the journal &quot;Left&quot;, after quitting their respective Marxist parties (the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Independent Labour Party) for their support for the war, and Smith&#x27;s election in 1944 strengthened the party&#x27;s syndicalist, libertarian vision.

The war administration was an all-party coalition government incorporating the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Parties, who agreed that their MP vacancies should be filled unopposed. Common Wealth intervention allowed a radicalising electorate to return socialist candidates in Conservative seats: in Eddisbury, Skipton and Chelmsford.

In February 1943, the party contested and lost four by-elections: on the tenth in Ashford Catherine Williamson against the Conservative by 5,000 votes; the next day, Wintringham in North Midlothian against that party&#x27;s candidate by 869 votes; on the sixteenth and twenty-third against others in North Portsmouth and Watford by more than 2,000 votes.

In April, John Eric Loverseed amounted to the first winning candidate returned to the Commons, by winning Eddisbury. In November 1944, he left the party and joined Labour in May of the next year. In the 1945 general election, voters deserted Common Wealth for Labour – only Chelmsford (not fought by Labour) was held. In 1946 after Wintringham left the party, that MP, Ernest Millington, crossed the floor to join the Labour Party.

==Post–war development==

The inability to maintain a Parliamentary presence created a crisis for Common Wealth. At the Hastings conference in 1946, the party split. Two-thirds, including the original leadership, defected to Labour but were unable to persuade the remainder to disband. Tom and Kitty Wintringham left and Tom joined the Labour Party, though kept friendly with CW members and kept an active interest the party and the development of its theory and stance until his death, Kitty remained informally involved with &quot;The Libertarian&quot; until she died in 1963. Many of the new leadership then elected had joined when in the armed forces among which prominent figures of the Cairo Forces Parliament.

During the 1950s, the party made preparations to contest Oxford, with Douglas Stuckey as prospective candidate, but these were never brought to fruition. For the remainder of its existence it became, &quot;de facto&quot;, a pressure group, its organisation evolving, and generally contracting, as old age took its toll of the leading figures.

In the postwar period, CW was active in some domestic and international campaigns; it developed worldwide contacts. For Israel and the less-than-state of Palestine, it advocated two internationally recognised states. At home, it helped to form the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM) and co-campaigned for small parties to be allowed to make party political broadcasts. Through the latter campaign it developed close links with Plaid Cymru (sharing a syndicalist tradition) and the Scottish National Party.

The active collaboration led to the joint publication in 1956 of &quot;Our Three Nations&quot;. This advocated very great devolution in the United Kingdom: a &#x27;confraternity&#x27; of self-governing states. CW also favoured regional government in England and was sympathetic to Mebyon Kernow. Members such as Banks joined the Wessex Regionalists. Executive Committee members played an active, at times leading, role in these movements, especially during the 1980s. Others were active in nascent environmentalism, including its then main political party, the Ecology Party.

In 1992, surviving members and political associates met in London for a 50th anniversary lunch. Weeks later, the death of W.J. &#x27;Buck&#x27; Taylor, for many years the Secretary, called into question the ability to continue. Common Wealth resolved to dissolve at a Cheltenham meeting the next year.

==Archives and key accounts==
The archives are kept by the University of Sussex. The early history was the subject of the doctoral thesis of Angus Calder.

Detail of the party&#x27;s formation and by-elections can be found in a biography of Wintringham, &quot;The Last English Revolutionary&quot;. The tussle between Acland&#x27;s didactic Anglican-rooted Christianism and Wintringham&#x27;s syndicalist Marxism is in &quot;Socialism and Religion: Roads to Common Wealth&quot;.

Primary source contemporary chronologies are in periodicals &quot;The Libertarian&quot; and then &quot;Common Wealth Journal&quot;.

==Later platform==
Common Wealth&#x27;s later political philosophy was heavily influenced by a notion that a new mode of production, known as managerialism, was replacing the archetypal forms of capitalism. This idea was drawn from works such as James Burnham&#x27;s &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot; (1941). Burnham (a former Trotskyist Marxist turned pioneering neoconservative) argued that the rise of a salaried managerial class, accompanied by the withdrawal of shareholders from active running of big businesses, was creating a split between the (legal) proprietors of organisations and a class of non-proprietorial professionals who were responsible for the day-to-day management of those organisations. CW used this to develop a modified Marxist analysis — this saw managerialism as a historical stage between capitalism and socialism.

This, per Common Wealth, characterised the Attlee government&#x27;s post-war programme of nationalisation. The party set out its critique of managerialism in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Nationalisation is not Socialism&quot; (1948). In essence, this critique suggested that: many features of the Labour Party&#x27;s programme had not been approved by voters; this confirmed the theory that power, in &quot;socialised&quot; economies as much as market ones, was in the hands of a largely unaccountable managerial class, which served the owners of capital at arm&#x27;s length; most private ownership was continuing; shares were being replaced by loan stock at inflated valuations, the interest on which was paid from the profits of state-run industries; ministers refused to answer questions in parliament on operational matters, meaning that the management of nationalised industries were not subject to meaningful democratic control; worker representation at board level was either token or non-existent and often justified by stereotyping that workers did not yet have the skills required (unconvincing in CW&#x27;s view given the record of the co-operative movement, the trade unions, and the Labour Party itself), and; a growing cult of &quot;experts&quot; (i.e. technocracy) and a drift towards authoritarianism, as in oft-appointed ex-military officers running such industries.
Worker-controlled organisations were also promoted by CW, which publicised successful real-world examples, such as the chemical manufacturer Scott Bader Commonwealth. While CW was critical of communist dictatorships, it expressed limited support for the system of worker self-management in Yugoslavia under Josep Tito (see Economy of SFR Yugoslavia).

Although sympathetic to the non-aligned movement, CW was critical of its inclusion of dictatorships from various part of the political spectrum. Some members of CW were active in Amnesty International.

==Influences in philosophy==
Other influences during this era included humanistic psychology. Noted psychologists Dr Don Bannister and Dr James Hemming were CW members, and via Hemming and Wintringham so did their friend Ernst Schumacher make contributions to party thought. CW enthusiastically adopted the &#x27;executive-sensory nexus&#x27; model of organisation, derived from left/right brain theory. Under this, the Executive Committee, responsible for current decision-making, is shadowed by a scrutiny panel, known in CW as the Sensory Committee, whose role is monitoring and review, research and longer-term development. CW&#x27;s interest in optimising social organisation consistent with its principles also led it to develop close links with the School of Integrative Social Research at Braziers Park, Oxfordshire.

<text>Asociación de Nuevos Emigrados Revolucionarios Cubanos (Association of Cuban Revolutionary New Emigrants) was a Cuban leftist group organized in Mexico in 1926 by Julio Antonio Mella.

ANERC would expand beyond Mexico, opening branches in New York and Paris. Mella served as the chairman of the organization. ANERC published the magazine &quot;Cuba Libre&quot;.

== Julio Antonio Mella ==
Julio Antonio Mella was one of the first early figures of PCC history. Mella gained popularity during the hunger strike that he started in December 1925, as a student leader protesting against the government of Gerardo Machado. Mella was exiled from Cuba in 1925 and came to Mexico in 1926. In Mexico, Mella founded the Asociación de Nuevos Emigrados Revolucionarios Cubanos. He was also actively working as a Marxist revolutionary to overthrow General Machado&#x27;s dictatorship government. Mella was assassinated in Mexico in 1929. Although Mella&#x27;s two killers were identified at the time, there was no official reason for Mella&#x27;s death, but there were several possible parties that could have been responsible for his assassination. The Cuban government under Machado or the feuding between Stalin and Trotsky in the Soviet Union are both theories on the reason for his death.

<text>The WWE United States Championship is a men&#x27;s professional wrestling championship promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on the SmackDown brand division. It is one of two secondary championships for WWE&#x27;s main roster, along with the WWE Intercontinental Championship on Raw. The current champion is Shinsuke Nakamura, who is in his third reign. He won the title by defeating LA Knight at Survivor Series: WarGames on November 30, 2024.

The championship was established on January 1, 1975, as the version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship that was defended in Jim Crockett Promotions, and later assumed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which eventually seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Harley Race was the inaugural champion. After WCW was purchased by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship was defended in the WWF until it was unified with the Intercontinental Championship at that year&#x27;s Survivor Series. After the 2002 brand extension and the promotion being renamed WWE, the championship was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship in July 2003 as a secondary title of the SmackDown brand. The United States Championship has switched between brands over the years, usually as a result of the WWE Draft; the 2023 draft moved the title back to SmackDown. This belt is described as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to a world championship.

Of WWE&#x27;s currently active championships, the United States Championship is the only one that did not originate in the promotion. It is the second-oldest active title in the company, behind the WWE Championship (1963), but the third longest-tenured championship, behind the WWE and Intercontinental Championships (1979), as WWE has only owned the United States Championship since 2001.

== History ==

The United States Championship began as a regional championship called the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, one of several versions of the title allowed in different territories under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) bylaws. It was created by and defended in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) run by Jim Crockett Jr. Introduced on January 1, 1975, Harley Race became the inaugural champion. The title quickly replaced the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship as the top singles title in the promotion. While the NWA recognized only one World Heavyweight Champion, there was no single undisputed United States Champion as a number of NWA regional promotions recognized their own version of the title and champion. That changed, however, in January 1981; San Francisco-based NWA territory Big Time Wrestling, which was the last remaining promotion outside the Mid-Atlantic territory that recognized its own United States Champion, ceased operations around that time, leaving the Mid-Atlantic version as the only remaining United States Championship.

The title remained the primary championship within the Mid-Atlantic territory until 1986 when Crockett gained control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The United States title then became the secondary championship of the promotion. After Ted Turner bought the company and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in November 1988, the title continued to be used and recognized as secondary to the World Championship. WCW began to pull itself away from the NWA, demonstrated by the company changing the name of the title to the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in January 1991.

On the April 6, 1991, episode of &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, Nikita Koloff destroyed the classic 1980s United States Heavyweight Championship belt during a post-match brawl with Lex Luger, who was in his fourth reign as champion. Koloff, who claimed to be the true champion, knocked Luger unconscious by striking him with the title belt and then repeatedly smashed the championship belt into a ringpost. Luger would appear without a physical championship belt, and later became the first to wear a newly designed belt, which was used up through WCW&#x27;s closing in March 2001, after being purchased by rival promotion, the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

When WWF purchased WCW, they used the United States title during the WWF&#x27;s Invasion storyline. The title was deactivated after being unified with the then-WWF Intercontinental Championship at that year&#x27;s Survivor Series, when United States Champion Edge defeated Intercontinental Champion Test, becoming the new Intercontinental Champion. In July 2003, a year after the first brand extension went into effect in the promotion renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship by then-SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon and with a completely new belt design. It was commissioned to be a secondary championship for the SmackDown! brand, making the championship the only one from WCW to be reactivated as a WWE title (although the WCW Cruiserweight Championship had also become a WWE title, it was not deactivated and reactivated; it replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship during the Invasion storyline). Eddie Guerrero became the first champion after its reactivation by winning a tournament at that year&#x27;s Vengeance, defeating Chris Benoit in the final match. This was done shortly after the Intercontinental Championship was recommissioned by the Raw brand, making the title its equal counterpart. The first brand extension ended on August 29, 2011, allowing the United States Championship, as well as all other titles, to be defended on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. 

In 2015, WWE introduced an updated version of its Grand Slam Championship, and the United States Championship became officially recognized as a component of the re-established honor. In August at that year&#x27;s SummerSlam, United States Champion John Cena faced WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins in a Winner Takes All match, which Rollins ultimately won to become the first wrestler to hold the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and United States Championship simultaneously. Rollins held both titles until Cena defeated Rollins in his rematch for the title at Night of Champions the following month.

In July 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand extension; during the draft, United States Champion Rusev was drafted to the Raw brand. Days later, he successfully defended the title against SmackDown draftee Zack Ryder at Battleground, keeping the title exclusive to Raw. On April 11, 2017, United States Champion Kevin Owens, along with the title, moved to SmackDown as a result of that year&#x27;s Superstar Shake-up. Owens was already scheduled to defend the title against Chris Jericho at the Raw-exclusive pay-per-view Payback on April 30. Then-SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan declared that regardless of who won at Payback, the United States Championship would remain on SmackDown; Jericho defeated Owens for the title at Payback and he transferred to SmackDown. During the 2018 Superstar Shake-up, the title briefly returned to Raw when champion Jinder Mahal was drafted to the brand. However, it was immediately returned to SmackDown after Jeff Hardy defeated Mahal for the title and was drafted to SmackDown the next night. The championship definitively returned to Raw in 2019 when reigning champion Samoa Joe was drafted to the brand during that year&#x27;s Superstar Shake-up. During the November 8, 2024, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, general manager Nick Aldis introduced the women&#x27;s counterpart to the United States Championship.

==Belt design==

The design of the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship from 1991 to 1995 featured five plates. A center plate on the gold background consisted of a map of the Contiguous United States with a flag shown along with an eagle. On top of the plate shows the WCW logo with the two banners reading on the black background &quot;UNITED STATES&quot; along with two stars on each side while the text says &quot;HEAVYWEIGHT WRESTLING CHAMPION&quot; on the bottom. Both side plates on each side feature one with the U.S. flag with the text &quot;UNITED STATES&quot; while the other shows two wrestlers grappling with the WCW logo on top and the text &quot;CHAMPION&quot; on the bottom. After its minor update in 1995, the belt now featured three plates with the center plate slightly redesigned with the side plates also feature a gold filigree with the text &quot;WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING&quot;. This belt would also appear on WWF&#x27;s programming until November 2001.

After its reactivation in July 2003, the newly renamed WWE United States Championship was redesigned. This belt consisted of five plates. The center plate featured a heptagon with a enlarged U.S. flag along with the company&#x27;s scratch logo located at the top of the main plate in white and black paint. Below the logo is a gold banner with the words “WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT” etched inside. In the center of the main plate is a black banner with the words “UNITED STATES CHAMPION” etched in gold. On the bottom of the center plate, the name plate attaches to the main plate by two screws at the back. One of the side plates featured an light etching of an American bald eagle resting on top of a shield with the WWE logo painted white and red within the shield with an eagleholding a red and white striped banner as well as blue-painted square with a white star at the center is placed above the eagle The other side plate featured an portrait of an Statue of Liberty surrounded by four stars on each corner. In August 2014, the United States Championship belt, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the long-standing scratch logo with WWE&#x27;s current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network that launched earlier that year in February.

On the July 6, 2020, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after 17 years since the title&#x27;s reactivation, MVP introduced a completely new belt design for the United States Championship. The belt now features only three plates. The center plate is an upside down heptagon. The top portion of the center plate features the WWE logo flanked by white stars on a gold background. Below this, &quot;UNITED STATES&quot; is written in red, with &quot;CHAMPION&quot; prominently written below that in blue; eight stars divide the two. Below the word champion is an eagle with its wings spread out across the plate, with the red and white stripes of the American flag beneath its wings. Coming in line with WWE&#x27;s other championship belts, the belt features two side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion&#x27;s logos; the default side plates consist of a gold WWE logo over a silver globe. 

===Custom designs===
*In 2000, Lance Storm won the title and unofficially renamed it as the Canadian Heavyweight Championship, complete with large Canadian flag stickers that covered the belt&#x27;s faceplates.
*Throughout John Cena&#x27;s reign in 2004 and 2005, a spinner belt of this title was used during his championship run to fit his hip-hop persona at that time.
*During LA Knight&#x27;s reign in October 2024, he introduced his own custom version, featuring his &quot;LA&quot; logo in white all along the black strap.

== Brand designation history ==
Following the revival of the United States Championship in 2003, the title was designated to SmackDown. The brand extension was discontinued on August 29, 2011, but it was revived on July 19, 2016. The following list indicates the transitions of the United States Championship between the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.

==Tournaments==
===WWE United States Championship Tournament (2003)===
The tournament for the vacant WWE United States Championship was held between June 19 and July 27, 2003 for the SmackDown! brand, with the final being at Vengeance (2003).
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===WWE United States Championship Tournament (2017–18)===
At Clash of Champions 2017, Dolph Ziggler won the United States Championship by defeating defending champion Baron Corbin and Bobby Roode in a triple threat match. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, after recapping all of his previous accolades, Ziggler said that the WWE Universe did not deserve him and he dropped the title in the ring and left. After unsuccessful attempts at contacting Ziggler, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan declared the title vacant and announced a tournament to crown a new champion. The final was originally scheduled to occur at the 2018 Royal Rumble, but was moved up to the January 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. However, on the January 16 episode, after Jinder Mahal and Bobby Roode won their respective semifinals matches, Roode challenged Mahal to have the final that night and Bryan scheduled it for that episode&#x27;s main event.
==Reigns==
The inaugural champion was Harley Race. There have been 103 different champions, with Ric Flair having the most reigns at six. The longest-reigning champion is Lex Luger, who held the title for 523 days from May 22, 1989, to October 27, 1990. &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin&#x27;s second reign was the shortest, lasting approximately five minutes. Dean Ambrose is the longest-reigning champion under the WWE banner at 351 days, lasting from May 19, 2013, to May 5, 2014. Booker T and Seth Rollins are the only two men to have held both the United States Championship and a world championship simultaneously; in Booker T&#x27;s case, the world title was the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, while Rollins held the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (both Lex Luger and Goldberg were the United States Champion when they won their first world championship, but unlike Booker T and Rollins, they vacated the United States Championship after winning their world championships). Terry Funk is the oldest champion in the title&#x27;s history, winning the title at the age of 56 on September 22, 2000, while David Flair is the youngest at the age of 20 on July 5, 1999. Between NWA/WCW and WWE, the title has been vacated 21 times.

Shinsuke Nakamura is the current champion in his third reign. He defeated LA Knight at Survivor Series: WarGames on November 30, 2024, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

<text>The WWE European Championship was a professional wrestling championship competed for in World Wrestling Entertainment. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, multiple wrestlers held the European and WWE Men&#x27;s Intercontinental Championships within short spans of each other, and four held both simultaneously, becoming &quot;Eurocontinental champions&quot;.

Established in February 1997 as the &quot;WWF European Championship&quot;, the title incurred a brief hiatus in April 1999 due to then-champion Shane McMahon&#x27;s desire to retire as an &quot;undefeated champion&quot;. The title returned in June 1999. It was renamed in May 2002 when the WWF became the WWE before finally being unified with the WWE Intercontinental Championship in July that year. Despite its name, only two holders were actually from Europe: the British Bulldog, who was the inaugural and longest-reigning champion, and William Regal. It became a prominent singles title of the Attitude Era, held by then-former world champions Shawn Michaels and Diamond Dallas Page, along with Triple H, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, and Eddie Guerrero, among others.

==History==
In 1997, the British Bulldog was crowned the first WWF European Champion by winning a tournament that was held over several shows in Germany, culminating in a finals victory over Owen Hart. Upon winning the title, Shawn Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion in WWE. Michaels is the only wrestler to have held both the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and the European title at the same time.

After winning the European title, both D&#x27;Lo Brown and Al Snow were billed from different parts of Europe each week while champion. During Snow&#x27;s reign, he and &quot;Head&quot; dressed up as various ethnic stereotypes corresponding to the European location they were billed from, though not always in a politically or geographically correct manner. The title was retired briefly in April 1999 by then-champion Shane McMahon, who wanted to retire as an &quot;undefeated champion&quot;. McMahon reintroduced the championship two months later and gave it to Mideon, who saw the title belt in Shane&#x27;s travel bag and asked if he could have it.

===Inaugural tournament===
===Eurocontinental Champions and unification===
The term &quot;Eurocontinental Champion&quot; is a portmanteau of European and Intercontinental, used to describe wrestlers who held both titles simultaneously. Three wrestlers accomplished this feat. The first was D&#x27;Lo Brown, who defeated Mideon for the European title at Fully Loaded in 1999 and two nights later at a &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; taping, defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the Intercontinental Championship. A month later, at SummerSlam, Jarrett defeated Brown to win both titles but awarded the European Championship to Mark Henry the following day.

On the February 10, 2000 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Kurt Angle defeated Val Venis for the European Championship. Seventeen days later, at No Way Out, Angle defeated Chris Jericho for the Intercontinental Championship and became the third Eurocontinental Champion. Angle held the titles until WrestleMania 2000, when he faced Jericho and Chris Benoit in a two-fall triple threat match for both titles. In a rarity, Angle lost both of his championships without being pinned or forced to submit; Benoit defeated Jericho in the first fall for the Intercontinental Championship and Jericho defeated Benoit in the second fall to take the European Championship.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to WWE and the title was renamed accordingly, though the physical belt was not updated to reflect the name change. The title was then unified with the WWE Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match on the July 22, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated European Champion Jeff Hardy.

==Reigns==

The British Bulldog was the inaugural champion, and had the longest title reign at 206 days. William Regal and D&#x27;Lo Brown both had the most title reigns, each holding it four times. Jeff Hardy was the youngest champion at 24, while Diamond Dallas Page was the oldest champion at 45. Jeff Hardy was the final champion. The title was retired on the July 22, 2002 episode of Monday Night Raw when WWE Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated European Champion Jeff Hardy in a ladder match to unify the European title into the Intercontinental title.

==Other media==
The title appears in the video games &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot;,&quot;WWF No Mercy&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;WWE WrestleMania X8&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18,&quot; &quot;WWE 2K19&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K20&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K23 and WWE 2K24&quot;

<text>MV &quot;Empire MacAndrew&quot; was a grain ship converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier or MAC ship.

MV &quot;Empire MacKendrick&quot; was built at William Denny and Brothers Dumbarton Scotland under order from the Ministry of War Transport. As a MAC ship, only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel and she was operated by The Hain Steamship Company Ltd, St Ives, Cornwall.

After the war, the ship was converted back to a grain carrier, and eventually scrapped in China in 1970.

<text>The Sothic cycle or Canicular period is a period of 1,461 Egyptian civil years of 365 days each or 1,460 Julian years averaging  days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the heliacal rising of the star Sirius ( or , &#x27;Triangle&#x27;; , ) on 19 July in the Julian calendar. It is an important aspect of Egyptology, particularly with regard to reconstructions of the Egyptian calendar and its history. Astronomical records of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate Julian and Alexandrian calendars.

==Mechanics==
The ancient Egyptian civil year, its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the return of the bright star Sirius to the night sky was considered to herald the annual flooding of the Nile. However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate leap years until 22 BCE, its months &quot;wandered&quot; backwards through the solar year at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the Sothic year as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a Julian year.) The sidereal year of 365.25636 days is valid only for stars on the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun across the sky) and having no proper motion, whereas Sirius&#x27;s displacement ~40° below the ecliptic, its proper motion, and the wobbling of the celestial equator cause the period between its heliacal risings to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the &quot;wandering&quot; day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 Egyptian civil years or 1460 Julian years.

==Discovery==
This calendar cycle was well known in antiquity. Censorinus described it in his book &quot;De Die Natale&quot;, in CE 238, and stated that the cycle had renewed 100 years earlier on the 12th of August. In the ninth century, Syncellus epitomized the Sothic Cycle in the &quot;Old Egyptian Chronicle.&quot; Isaac Cullimore, an early Egyptologist and member of the Royal Society, published a discourse on it in 1833 in which he was the first to suggest that Censorinus had fudged the terminus date, and that it was more likely to fall in CE 136. He also computed the likely date of its invention as being around 1600 BCE.

In 1904, seven decades after Cullimore, Eduard Meyer carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of conventional Egyptian chronology are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by Censorinus as having happened on the Egyptian New Year&#x27;s Day between 139 CE and 142 CE.

The record itself actually refers to 21 July 140 CE, but astronomical calculation definitely dates the heliacal rising at 20 July 139 CE, Julian. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. A Julian leap day occurs in 140 CE, and so the new year on 1 Thoth is 20 July in 139 CE but it is 19 July for 140–142 CE. Thus Meyer was able to compare the Egyptian civil calendar date on which Sirius was observed rising heliacally to the Julian calendar date on which Sirius &quot;ought&quot; to have risen, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation.

To calculate a date astronomically, one also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius can be seen, and mislocating an observation can potentially throw off the resulting chronology by several decades. Official observations are known to have been made at Heliopolis (or Memphis, near Cairo), Thebes, and Elephantine (near Aswan), with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.

Meyer concluded that the Egyptian civil calendar was created in 4241 BCE. Recent scholarship, however, has discredited that claim. Most scholars either move the observation upon which he based this forward by one cycle of Sirius, to 19 July 2781 BCE, or reject the assumption that the document on which Meyer relied indicates a rise of Sirius at all.

==Chronological interpretation==
Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of Djer which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773 BCE. However, this date is too late for Djer&#x27;s reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian &quot;lunar&quot; calendar, instead of the solar Egyptian civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value.

Gautschy &quot;et al&quot;. (2017) claimed that a newly discovered Sothis date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model.

The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of Senusret III. This observation was almost certainly made at Itj-Tawy, the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786 BCE. The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991–1778 BCE), Parker reduces it to 206 years (1991–1785 BCE), based on 17 July 1872 BCE as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker&#x27;s investigation of lunar dates, the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007–1794 BCE interpreting the date 21 July 1888 BCE as the 120th year, and then for 2003–1790 BCE interpreting the date 20 July 1884 BCE as the 120th year.

The third observation was in the reign of Amenhotep I, and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504 BCE. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be extended some 20 years.

==Observational procedure and precession==
The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula formula_1 or half the harmonic mean. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. 

The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to axial precession, the movement of the Earth&#x27;s axis in relation to the sun.

The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility, nor the exact position observed. Throughout the year the star will rise to whatever altitude was chosen near the horizon approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to the same relative location at sunrise, regardless of the altitude chosen. This length of time can be called an &quot;observational year&quot;. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will – on average – exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed.

The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration happened to have been nearly exactly 365.25 days, in the early before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The value 1461 could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation.

It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky, like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the precession of the equinox:
:Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes – and so from the solstices – throughout these many centuries, despite precession. — J.Z. Buchwald (2003)
For the same reason, the heliacal rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do, but much slower. This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about 20 July, that is a month &quot;after&quot; the summer solstice.

==Problems and criticisms==
Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation. Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise.

A number of criticisms have been levelled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic. Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation. Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless. Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn&#x27;t merit mention, or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery.

Marc Van de Mieroop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and asserts that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE.
Some have recently claimed that the Theran eruption marks the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty, due to Theran ash and pumice discovered in the ruins of Avaris, in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era. Because the evidence of dendrochronologists indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BCE, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50–80 years at the outset of the 18th Dynasty. Claims that the Thera eruption is described on the &quot;Tempest Stele&quot; of Ahmose I have been disputed by writers such as Peter James.

<text>MV &quot;Empire MacCallum&quot; was a grain ship converted to a merchant aircraft carrier or MAC ship.

==History==
MV &quot;Empire MacCallum&quot; was built at Lithgows shipyard, Glasgow, Scotland, under order from the Ministry of War Transport. As a MAC ship, only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel, She was operated by Hain Steam Ship Co Ltd of St Ives. On 7 July 1944, a Fairey Swordfish aircraft mistakenly sank the Free French submarine in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. Among the aircraft that served on &quot;Empire MacCallum&quot; was Fairey Swordfish Mk II LS326 where it became part of &#x27;K&#x27; flight. The aircraft had previously been on . In November 2010, it was airworthy with the Royal Navy Historic Flight.

After the war, the ship was converted to a grain carrier, and eventually scrapped at Osaka in 1960.

<text>Ernest DiGregorio (born January 15, 1951), also known as &quot;Ernie D.&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Buffalo Braves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics from 1973 to 1978.

DiGregorio was named NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1973–74 season and shares the NBA rookie record for assists in a single game with 25. Due to a severe knee injury suffered early in DiGregorio&#x27;s professional career, he played only five NBA seasons.

A 1973 NCAA All-American at Providence, DiGregorio was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
DiGregorio was born on January 15, 1951, in North Providence, Rhode Island. At age 12, he decided to become a professional basketball player, and put in thousands of hours over the years to develop his skills. He played on the 1968 Rhode Island (Class B) champions at North Providence High School.

== College and NBA career ==

=== Providence College ===
DiGregorio attended Providence College, graduating in 1973. He played basketball under Hall of Fame head coach Dave Gavitt. DiGregorio, Marvin Barnes and Kevin Stacom led the Providence team to a Final Four appearance in the 1973 National Collegiate Athletic Conference (NCAA) Tournament in DiGregorio&#x27;s senior season. They eventually lost to Memphis State, but only after Barnes sustained a knee injury that forced an early exit, after playing only 11 minutes in the game. DiGregorio received the NCAA East Regional Most Outstanding Player honors.

In the 1972-73 season, DiGregorio averaged 24.5 points per game and 8.6 assists per game (a school record as of 2024), and was Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Player of the Year. He received the 1973 Lapchick Award as the nation’s outstanding senior. He was an All-American for each of his three varsity years at Providence, and a first-team consensus All-American his senior year. Over his three-year career, he averaged 20.5 points a game, and a school record 7.7 assists per game (as of 2024).

Providence retired his number at halftime of a February 5, 2008 game against DePaul, giving the fans DiGregorio bobblehead figures.

=== International exhibition series ===
After playing for the Providence, DiGregorio played on a college all-star team, coached by Bob Cousy, against a team from the Soviet Union in a six-game exhibition series. DiGregorio was considered the star of the series. Among others, the U.S. team also included future Hall of Fame center Bill Walton, Swen Nater (who replaced Walton after an injury in game 1), Providence teammate Marvin Barnes, future Hall of Fame player Bobby Jones, Pat McFarland, and Tom Henderson, who defeated the Soviet team in the bruising six-game exhibition series, which helped heal the still-open wound of the United States&#x27; loss in the 1972 Summer Olympic finals. The Soviet team included, among others, Aleksander Belov. The American team won the first game 83–65, with DiGregorio and Nater the leading scorers (14 points each), and DiGregorio making crowd pleasing sharp passes. In the fifth game, DiGregorio scored two baskets in 13 seconds to send the game into overtime, which the U.S. won 89–80. DiGregorio had 25 points and 11 assists, and Barnes scored 8 points in overtime.

=== Buffalo Braves (1973–1977) ===
DiGregorio was drafted by the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association in the ABA&#x27;s 1973 special circumstances draft but opted instead for the NBA.

He was selected third overall by the Buffalo Braves (a franchise now known as the Los Angeles Clippers) in the 1973 NBA draft, out of Providence College. DiGregorio won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 1973–74 after averaging 15.2 points, and leading the league in both free throw percentage (.902) and assists per game (8.2), while playing 35.9 minutes per game. DiGregorio still holds the NBA rookie record for assists in a single game with 25 (a record now shared with Nate McMillan). The following year, he had a severe knee injury that cut short his future productivity and remaining career.

He would never again come close to his 1973-74 level of production. He played only 31 games of the 1974-75 season, and 67 games the next year, playing only 20 minutes a game and averaging less than seven points a game. His coach Jack Ramsay thought DiGregorio had lost speed and quickness after knee surgery, and made him the team&#x27;s fourth guard; though DiGregorio disagreed with that assessment. During DiGregorio&#x27;s last full season with the Braves (1976–77), he was up to 28 minutes a game, and averaged 10.7 points and 4.7 assists per game. He led the league in free throw percentage a second time, with a then-NBA record 94.5%. As of 2024, this is the 9th best seasonal percentage of all-time.

In 1977, he joined fellow NBA stars Julius Erving, Rick Barry, Wilt Chamberlain, and Pete Maravich, in endorsing Spalding&#x27;s line of rubber basketballs, with a signature &quot;Ernie D.&quot; ball making up part of the collection.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (1977–1978) ===
Before the 1977–78 season, the Brave&#x27;s sold DiGregorio&#x27;s contract rights to the Los Angeles Lakers, after Buffalo had acquired future Hall of Fame point guard Nate &quot;Tiny&quot; Archibald; part of a greater plan of player transactions in Buffalo. DiGregorio played in a Lakers&#x27; uniform, under coach Jerry West (who had been hopeful about DiGregorio as his point guard), in only 25 games before being waived.

=== Boston Celtics (1978) ===
The Boston Celtics signed him as a free agent but he played only sparingly for the rest of the season. He would not play in the NBA again, although he did not formally retire until 1981.

==Honors==
* In 1999, DiGregorio was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.
* In 2001, DiGregorio was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.
* In 2016, he was inducted into the Eastern College Athletic Conference Hall of Fame.
* In 2019, DiGregorio was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.
* In 2024, The Ernie DiGregorio Sports Complex was dedicated by North Providence at the Millar-Waite-Evans Memorial Park.

== Post-NBA ==
After 1978, he returned to Providence College to earn a degree. In 1981, at only 30 years old, Celtic coach Bill Fitch gave DiGregorio an opportunity to try out for the Celtics. DiGregorio tried to make a comeback with the Nets in 1983. He was a head coach for the Rhode Island School for the Deaf. He later became the head coach at his high school alma mater, North Providence High. He was also a referee in the Continental Basketball Association for a year, and worked with an advertising firm in public relations. He later took a job at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. He has written children&#x27;s books, worked in the community holding basketball clinics and advised young basketball players at local schools. He worked as Director of Operations for the Buffalo 716ers of the American Basketball Association.

<text>MV &quot;Empire MacDermott&quot; was a bulk grain ship built as a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship). She served with the British Merchant Navy during the Second World War, with rudimentary aircraft handling facilities operated by a Fleet Air Arm &quot;air party&quot;.

&quot;Empire MacDermott&quot; was built by William Denny and Brothers, Dumbarton, Scotland. She spent most of her time on the Atlantic convoy routes, providing air cover and transporting desperately needed grain to the UK. After the end of the, she was handed over to Buries Markes Ltd, London in 1947 and returned to merchant service the following year under the name &quot;La Cumbre&quot;. She was sold on again in 1959, this time to Canero Cia Nav. S. A., Panama. They sailed her as &quot;Parnon&quot; under the Greek flag until 1969, when they sold her to Southern Shipping &amp; Enterprises, Hong Kong. They renamed her &quot;Starlight&quot;, and sailed her under the Somalian flag. She was then transferred to the China Ocean Shipping Co, Peking in 1975, and by 1991 she had been deleted from Lloyd&#x27;s Register.

In 1951, Flores signed a five-film contract with Suevia Films for a value of 6 million pesetas, which became the largest contract for a performing artist in Spanish history. Under that contract she starred in major productions like (1951), (1953), (1954) and (1962), among many others, which spawned the signature songs &quot; and &quot;. Since then, she was popularly dubbed as (&quot;the Pharaoh&quot;). During her life, Flores performed in more than 35 films, pigeonholed, in many of them, in Andalusian folklore. As a , Flores enraged several generations of continents, although she distanced herself from flamenco canons. She also recorded over twenty albums, which she toured through Europe, Latin America and the United States.

Her strong personality, recognizable image, remarkable professional trajectory and sometimes controversial personal life, have turned Flores into a Spanish pop culture icon. She is often cited as the &quot;biggest exporter of Andalusian culture to date&quot; as well as a &quot;pioneer&quot;, being tributed many times in recent television series and documentaries such as the biographical film (2007). Lola became the matriarch of what would later be the Flores family, filled with popular singers and television personalities such as Lolita Flores, Rosario, Alba Flores and Elena Furiase. In 1995, Lola Flores died, aged 72, in Alcobendas due to health complications caused by a breast cancer.

== Life and career ==
=== 1923–1950: Early life and career beginnings ===

Flores was the daughter of Pedro Flores Pinto (1897–1973) and Rosario Ruiz Rodríguez (1901–1989). Her father owned a bar and her mother worked making clothes. She learned to dance with María Pantoja and to understand flamenco with Sebastián Nuñez. Her debut at 16 years of age was with Custodia Romero&#x27;s company in the Villamarta Theatre of Jerez de la Frontera. Shortly after leaving Jerez for Madrid, she rose to fame and soon signed the most expensive contract of the time (6 million pesetas in the 1950s) which launched her career, touring throughout Latin America.
In 1958, she married Antonio González &quot;el Pescaílla&quot;, a gypsy guitarist from Barcelona. She had three children: singer and actress Lolita Flores; rock musician, singer and actor Antonio Flores; and singer and actress Rosario Flores. Lola Flores, while one quarter gypsy through her maternal grandfather, Manuel, who was a street vendor, referred to herself as &quot;paya&quot; or non-gypsy Spanish. Nevertheless, she is considered an icon of the Gypsy and Roma community in Spain, particularly since she married into a gypsy family.

&quot;La Faraona&quot; died of breast cancer in 1995, aged 72, and was buried in the Cementerio de la Almudena in Madrid. Shortly after her death, her distraught 33-year-old son, Antonio Flores, committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates and was buried beside her.

In 2007, the biopic &quot;Lola, la película&quot; was made. The movie describes her early life, starting in 1931 until 1958.

Lola Flores, a native of Jerez de la Frontera (Cádiz) was an icon of traditional Andalusian folklore, recognized throughout Spain as well as internationally. She became a famous dancer and singer of Andalusian folklore at a very young age, performing flamenco, copla, and chotis and appearing in films from 1939 to 1987.

Her father owned a bar and her mother was a dressmaker. She learned to dance with María Pantoja and to understand Flamenco culture with Sebastián Nuñez. Her debut at 16 years of age was with Custodia Romero&#x27;s company in the Villamarta Theatre of Jerez de la Frontera. After several spectacles, she went to Madrid.

Shortly after leaving Jerez for Madrid, she rose to fame and soon signed the biggest contract of the time (6 million pesetas in the 1950s) which launched her career touring throughout Latin America.

In 1943, with the protection of business owner Adolfo Arenaza, Flores set out a performance named Zambra with Manolo Caracol, which with small variations would be kept several years with great success. Zambra was decisive for Lola Flores&#x27;s career, a spectacle very organized in all his elements for the one that they chose to León Quintero and Quiroga and that had her culminating number in &quot;La niña de fuego&quot; and of that there went out also &quot;La Zarzamora&quot;, one of the songs most associated with Lola.

The collaboration of the couple, who supported each other in both their private and professional life, led to a relationship that was more than professional reflected on the stage, and was very successful. This eventually lead them to become proper business owners. Together they produced two movies, &quot;Embrujo&quot; (1947) and &quot;La niña de venta&quot; (1951). In 1951, the professional and sentimental separation of the couple started, and they eventually stopped working together.

=== 1951–1960: Career breakthrough and marriage ===
In 1951 the Spanish film producer Suevia films wanted to consolidate a star-system of the Spanish cinema, which had his expansion towards America. The owner, Cesáreo González decided at the end of 1951 to contract Lola Flores. He signed an agreement with Lola Flores for two years and 5 films for an amount of six million pesetas. That contract included cinema, TV, theatre and also a tour along throughout America.

The agreement was signed in Bar Chicote, in Madrid with the cameras of NO-DO, which was a great advertising event. With this agreement, Lola Flores started filming news films like &quot;La niña de la venta&quot;, with Ramón Torrado in 1951 and &quot;¡Ay pena, penita, pena!&quot; with Miguel Morayta in 1953. Lola also appeared in advertising campaigns as part of the agreement.

On 12 April 1952, Lola Flores went to Mexico with her family, where she obtained a great reception. From Mexico, she went to Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Ecuador, Buenos Aires and New York. It has gone down in history as an authoritative &quot;The New York Times&quot; review the following and famous quote that was never really written about her: &quot;Lola Flores, a Spanish artist, she neither sings, and does not even dance, but you can&#x27;t miss her&quot;. This statement has been spread all over the media as if it was true. The Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, conducted an investigation on the matter and concluded that it is part of the mythical history of the artist, but that this was never written in the New York Times.

On 27 October 1958, she married Antonio González el Pescaílla (1925–1999), a gypsy guitarist from Barcelona. She had three children: singer Lolita Flores (Dolores González Flores) (1958) Antonio Flores (Antonio Gónzález Flores) (1961–1995); and Rosario Flores (Rosario González Flores) (1963), they were one of the most famous families of artists in Spain. Moreover, Lola Flores was the sister of Carmen Flores (1936), and her nephew was the footballer and coach Quique Sánchez Flores (1965). She is the grandmother of the actress Elena Furiase and Guillermo Furiase (Lolita&#x27;s children), the actress Alba Flores (Antonio&#x27;s daughter), known for her role as &#x27;Nairobi&#x27; in &#x27;The Money Heist&#x27;, and Lola Orellana and Pedro Antonio Lazaga (Rosario&#x27;s children). She was the godmother of Carmen Morales, daughter of the famous singer and actress Rocio Dúrcal.

=== 1960–1995: Decline of copla and legal problems ===
In March 1987, The district attorney&#x27;s office presented a complaint against the artist and her husband for not having presented the declarations of the income tax between the years 1982 and 1985, they had to pay a bail of 145 million pesetas (€871.561 ). In 1989, The Madrid provincial court decreed her absolution for a legal vacuum motivated by a judgment of the Constitutional Court that had annulled partially the Law of the tax.

Finally, Lola Flores was condemned by the Supreme Court in 1991, as the author of 4 crimes against the Inland Revenue. She was sentenced to two different punishments of a month and a day and two others of seven months in prison, but she would never serve the sentences. The process had an important social transcendence, since she was a very famous person and was chosen by the Inland Revenue as an example of their battle against tax fraud.

== Selected filmography ==
== TV programmes ==
Lola participated in different TV programmes throughout her life. Sometimes she sang, others she danced, others she competed and in others she was just interviewed.

When private channels were introduced in Spain in the 90s, Lola took advantage and started to present her first TV programme. She began to make use of this facet, but it would soon end because of her death.

These were the TV programmes that she presented:
* &quot;El tablao de Lola&quot; (Telecinco) (1992)
* &quot;Sabor a Lolas&quot; (Antenta 3 TV) (1992–1993) with her daughter, Lolita Flores

Her last programme on TVE (Spanish Television, the national state-owned public-service television broadcaster in Spain) had to be cancelled in the 9th programme due to her illness, which started to get worse. That show would be the last time she would sing in public. At first, she was supposed to remain standing during her performance, but finally, she had to ask for a chair. She hardly moved her right arm, since it was swollen due to the cancer she suffered.

Her programmes were characterized by the presenters, who were part of the spectacle, in which they sang and danced. During this whole period in television she demonstrated that she did not stop singing and dancing until her last days.

== TV series ==
Lola Flores never took part in a TV series as a protagonist. However, one of the last projects she made was &quot;El coraje de vivir&quot;, where she narrated her own life and which had several episodes. She also played an important role in the TV series&quot; Juncal&quot; in 1988.

In that event Lola participated in all the performances; with Rocío Jurado recorded the song &quot;Dejándonos la piel&quot;.

Her last tribute was given by Antena 3 channel in 1994, to which Lola was invited, but she did not perform; she only enjoyed the performances of her friends and family, during that act said his mythical phrase: &quot;Ya puedo morir tranquila&quot; (I can now die calm).

The sisters Salazar, better known as Azúcar Moreno, paid tribute to her with a song that had and has still a great recognition in Spain and the entire world titled &quot;Bailando con Lola&quot;.

In her native city, she could not get to inaugurate an avenue in her honor, but she had the opportunity to witness how she was granted, in 1965, the silver medal of Jerez de la Frontera, in thanks for taking the name of his city to all corners of the world. The construction of a museum is being built in her memory in the Palace of Villapanés (next to her monument), which will house bibliography, multimedia and personal objects (dresses and enseres) of the artist. After years of political controversies and funding issues, the Lola Flores museum is finally built near the future location of the Jerez Flamenco museum at the former &quot;Oil Warehouses&quot;. It is expected to be open for the second quarter of 2022.

In 2016, the Lara and Cajasol Foundations awarded the Manuel Alvar Prize for Humanistic Studies 2016 to the essay &quot;Lola Flores: Otra Historia del Espectáculo en la España Contemporánea&quot; by Alberto Romero Ferrer. On 21 January 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 93rd birthday.

In 2019, a theatre production in Seville performed a biographical jukebox musical featuring Flores&#x27; repertoire. Ever since that moment, Lola&#x27;s daughters Rosario and Lolita have been trying to make a musical about the life of her mother. A script is currently being assessed by them, with a tentative release date for the musical being set for 2023.

<text>MV &quot;Empire MacMahon&quot; was an oil tanker converted to a merchant aircraft carrier or MAC ship.

MV &quot;Empire MacMahon&quot; was built by Swan Hunter, Wallsend under order from the Ministry of War Transport. She entered service as a MAC ship in December 1943; however, only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel. She was operated by Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co.

She returned to merchant service as an oil tanker in 1946 and renamed &quot;Naninia&quot; and was eventually scrapped in Hong Kong in 1960.

<doc id="985609" wikidata="Q1380878" url="?curid=985609" title="Vortimer">
<text>Vortimer (Old Welsh Guorthemir, ), also known as Saint Vortimer (,  &quot;Vortimer the Blessed&quot;), is a figure in British tradition, a son of the 5th-century Britonnic ruler Vortigern. He is remembered for his fierce opposition to his father&#x27;s Saxon allies. In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, he overthrows his father and reigns as King of Britain for a brief period before his death restores Vortigern to power.

==Accounts==
Vortimer first appears in the 9th-century work known as the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. According to the &quot;Historia&quot;, Vortigern allows Saxons under Hengest and Horsa to settle on the Isle of Thanet, and offers them provisions in exchange for their service as mercenaries. Vortigern soon proves to be an &quot;ignorant king&quot;, and the wily Hengest manipulates him into ceding over more land and allowing more settlers to come from Germania. After a dire period of Saxon encroachment, exacerbated by even more disgraceful behavior on Vortigern&#x27;s part, Vortimer finally rises up against the Saxons. He pushes them back to Thanet, and meets them in four battles. At the third battle Horsa and Vortimer&#x27;s brother Catigern are slain; at the fourth the Saxons are pushed back to the sea. Shortly thereafter, however, Vortimer dies. He asks his followers to bury him at the place where the Saxons first landed in Britain as a totem against further invasion. However, his followers fail to heed his warning and the Saxons return. Another manuscript of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;Chronica Minora&quot;, Berlin, 1892) follows this with: &quot;if they had kept his command, there is no doubt that they would have obtained whatever they wished through the prayers of St Germanus.” According to the Welsh Triads his bones were buried &quot;in the Chief Ports of this Island&quot;.

Three of Vortimer&#x27;s battle sites are named: the first was on the Darent &quot;super flumen Derguentid″&quot; the second &quot;at the ford called Episford in their language, Rhyd yr Afael in ours ″&quot;super vadum quod dicitur in lingua eorum Episford, in nostra autem lingua Rithergabail&quot;″&quot;; the third was &quot;by the inscribed stone on the shore of the Gallic Sea ″&quot;in campo juxta Lapidem tituli, qui est super ripam Gallici maris&quot;″&quot;. While some aspects of these battles correspond with three battles in Kent mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; between the years 455 and 466 (especially the Battle of Aylesford), there are a number of crucial inconsistencies. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; does not name Vortimer, and in fact credit Vortigern as the British leader in one of the battles.

The legendary material in the Historia Brittonum was slightly expanded upon in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot;, widely believed to be a fictional account of the rulers of Britain. There the Britons abandon Vortigern and elevate Vortimer to be king of Britain. After he has driven out the Saxons, Vortimer is poisoned by his stepmother Rowena (a Saxon) and Vortigern regains the crown. Geoffrey says that Vortimer was buried at Trinovantum (London), and mentions the link with St. Germanus, who encourages Vortimer to rebuild the churches.

This account survives in Geoffrey&#x27;s continuators Wace and Layamon: they both give London as his burial place; Layamon specifically mentions Belyn&#x27;s Gate (Billingsgate. He also includes the detail that Vortimer offered twelve pennies reward for the head of any heathen brought to him. Both authors mention the connection with St Germanus.

Writing in the eighteenth century, the Rev. Philip Morant tells us that Aldroen, king of Armorica, sent ten thousand troops to Britain under the command of Aurelius Ambrosius. He was seen as a usurper by Vortimer&#x27;s followers, and a civil war broke out between the two factions, which lasted seven or eight years. Peace was eventually brokered between the warring factions by splitting Britain between them: Aurelius ruling the western part of the island, with Vortimer and Vortigern in the east: &quot;divided from one another by... Watling Street&quot;. Morant says that Vortimer died in 475, but does not mention poison.

<text>MV &quot;Acavus was a [[Motor ship|motor]] [[Oil tanker|tanker]] that was built in 1935, and converted into a [[merchant aircraft carrier]] (MAC) in 1943. She was built for [[Anglo-Saxon Petroleum]], which is part of [[Shell plc|Royal Dutch Shell]]. In 1952 she was transferred to a French subsidiary of Shell and renamed Iacra&quot;. She was scrapped in France in 1963.

&quot;Acavus&quot; was the last ship ever built by Workman, Clark and Company. The company was founded in 1879, and went into receivership in May 1935, about four months after completing &quot;Acavus&quot;.

==Building and registration==
In the 1930s, Shell ordered a series of oil tankers called the &quot;Triple Twelve class&quot; from various shipyards. Workman, Clark built one member of the class. She was built as yard number 536; launched on 24 November 1934; and completed in January 1935. She was named after the &quot;Acavus&quot; genus of land snails. Her registered length was ; her beam was ; her depth was ; and her draught was . Her tonnages were and . She had a raked bow and a cruiser stern. Her main superstructure, including her bridge, was amidships. Her engine room and single funnel were aft.

&quot;Acavus&quot; had a single screw. It was driven by an eight-cylinder, four-stroke, single-acting Diesel engine that was built by Hawthorn, Leslie of Newcastle upon Tyne. It was rated at 502 NHP or 3,500 bhp, and gave her a speed of . As built, her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding, and an echo sounding device.

&quot;Acavus&quot; was registered at London. Her UK official number was 163564, and her call sign was GYDF.

==Second World War==
During the Battle of France, a fortnight after the Dunkirk evacuation, &quot;Acavus&quot; was in Le Verdon-sur-Mer, at the mouth of the Garonne, downriver from Bordeaux. On 17 June, she and several other merchant ships left Le Verdon as part of Operation Aerial.

Tankers were a priority for conversion into defensively equipped merchant ships. Primary armament for a ship such as &quot;Acavus&quot; was a single 4-inch (102 mm) gun mounted on her poop deck, for defence against surface ships and submarines.
Between 1942 and 1944, nine of Shell&#x27;s Triple Twelve class tankers were converted into MAC&#x27;s. Silley, Cox &amp; Co of Falmouth, Cornwall converted &quot;Acavus&quot;, fitting her out with a flight deck long by wide. She had no aircraft hangar or aircraft lift, but could carry three Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. Her armament was augmented with eight anti-aircraft guns: two Bofors 40mm autocannon and six Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. After conversion, her length overall was , and her beam was . Her displacement was full load, and standard.

As an MAC, &quot;Acavus&quot; continued to carry cargoes of oil. The conversion reduced her capacity by about 10 percent, and she was restricted to crude oil to reduce the fire hazard. She remained a Merchant Navy ship with civilian crew, but with the addition of Royal Navy aircrew and aircraft maintenance crew. She entered service as an MAC in October 1943. In 1945 or 1956 her flight deck was removed, and she was converted back into a conventional oil tanker.

==&quot;Iacra&quot;==
In 1952, Shell transferred &quot;Acavus&quot; from Anglo-Saxon Petroleum to a French subsidiary, the . She was renamed &quot;Iacra&quot;, after a genus of marine bivalves more usually called &quot;Abra&quot;. She was registered in Le Havre, and her call sign was changed to FOBT. By 1958, her navigation equipment included radar.

On 18 April 1963, &quot;Iacra&quot; arrived at La Seyne-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean coast of Southern France to be scrapped.

<text>Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is the inorganic compound with the formula . This orange-red, water-soluble cerium salt is a specialised oxidizing agent in organic synthesis and a standard oxidant in quantitative analysis.

==Preparation, properties, and structure==
The anion is generated by dissolving  in hot and concentrated nitric acid ().

The salt consists of the hexanitratocerate(IV) anion and a pair of ammonium cations . The ammonium ions are not involved in the oxidising reactions of this salt. In the anion each nitrate group chelates the cerium atom in a bidentate manner as shown below:

The anion has Th (idealized Oh) molecular symmetry. The core defines an icosahedron.

 is a strong one-electron oxidizing agent. In terms of its redox potential ( vs. N.H.E.) it is an even stronger oxidizing agent than  (). Few shelf-stable reagents are stronger oxidants. In the redox process Ce(IV) is converted to Ce(III), a one-electron change, signaled by the fading of the solution color from orange to a pale yellow (providing that the substrate and product are not strongly colored).

==Applications in organic chemistry==
In organic synthesis, CAN is useful as an oxidant for many functional groups (alcohols, phenols, and ethers) as well as C–H bonds, especially those that are benzylic. Alkenes undergo dinitroxylation, although the outcome is solvent-dependent. Quinones are produced from catechols and hydroquinones and even nitroalkanes are oxidized.

CAN provides an alternative to the Nef reaction; for example, for ketomacrolide synthesis where complicating side reactions usually encountered using other reagents. Oxidative halogenation can be promoted by CAN as an &quot;in situ&quot; oxidant for benzylic bromination, and the iodination of ketones and uracil derivatives.

===For the synthesis of heterocycles===
Catalytic amounts of aqueous CAN allow the efficient synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives. Quinoxalines are known for their applications as dyes, organic semiconductors, and DNA cleaving agents. These derivatives are also components in antibiotics such as echinomycin and actinomycin. The CAN-catalyzed three-component reaction between anilines and alkyl vinyl ethers provides an efficient entry into 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines and the corresponding quinolines obtained by their aromatization.

===As a deprotection reagent===
CAN is traditionally used to release organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the process, the metal is oxidised, CO is evolved, and the organic ligand is released for further manipulation. For example, with the Wulff–Dötz reaction an alkyne, carbon monoxide, and a chromium carbene are combined to form a chromium half-sandwich complex and the phenol ligand can be isolated by mild CAN oxidation.

CAN is used to cleave &quot;para&quot;-methoxybenzyl and 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ethers, which are protecting groups for alcohols. Two equivalents of CAN are required for each equivalent of &quot;para&quot;-methoxybenzyl ether. The alcohol is released, and the &quot;para&quot;-methoxybenzyl ether converts to &quot;para&quot;-methoxybenzaldehyde. The balanced equation is as follows:

==Other applications==
CAN is also a component of chrome etchant, a material that is used in the production of photomasks and liquid crystal displays. It is also an effective nitration reagent, especially for the nitration of aromatic ring systems. In acetonitrile, CAN reacts with anisole to obtain ortho-nitration products.

<text>MV &quot;Adula&quot; was one of nine Royal Dutch/Shell oil tankers converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship). The group is collectively known as the &quot;Rapana&quot; class.

MV &quot;Adula&quot; was built at Blytheswood and completed in March, 1937 as an oil tanker for the Royal Dutch/Shell line. She was converted at Falmouth to a MAC ship, entering service in February 1944.

As a MAC ship, she had no aircraft hangar, and continued to carry normal cargoes, although operating under Royal Navy control. Only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel.

At the end of the war, &quot;Adula&quot; was reconverted to an oil tanker. She served in this capacity until broken up for scrap at Briton Ferry in May 1953.
