<text>In geometry, a vertex figure, broadly speaking, is the figure exposed when a corner of a general -polytope is sliced off.

==Definitions==

Take some corner or vertex of a polyhedron. Mark a point somewhere along each connected edge. Draw lines across the connected faces, joining adjacent points around the face. When done, these lines form a complete circuit, i.e. a polygon, around the vertex. This polygon is the vertex figure.

More precise formal definitions can vary quite widely, according to circumstance. For example Coxeter (e.g. 1948, 1954) varies his definition as convenient for the current area of discussion. Most of the following definitions of a vertex figure apply equally well to infinite tilings or, by extension, to space-filling tessellation with polytope cells and other higher-dimensional polytopes.

===As a flat slice===
Make a slice through the corner of the polyhedron, cutting through all the edges connected to the vertex. The cut surface is the vertex figure (a plane figure). This is perhaps the most common approach, and the most easily understood. Different authors make the slice in different places. Wenninger (2003) cuts each edge a unit distance from the vertex, as does Coxeter (1948). For uniform polyhedra the Dorman Luke construction cuts each connected edge at its midpoint. Other authors make the cut through the vertex at the other end of each edge.

For an irregular polyhedron, cutting all edges incident to a given vertex at equal distances from the vertex may produce a figure that does not lie in a plane. A more general approach, valid for arbitrary convex polyhedra, is to make the cut along any plane which separates the given vertex from all the other vertices, but is otherwise arbitrary. This construction determines the combinatorial structure of the vertex figure, similar to a set of connected vertices (see below), but not its precise geometry; it may be generalized to convex polytopes in any dimension. However, for non-convex polyhedra, there may not exist a plane near the vertex that cuts all of the faces incident to the vertex.

===As a spherical polygon===
Cromwell (1999) forms the vertex figure by intersecting the polyhedron with a sphere centered at the vertex, small enough that it intersects only edges and faces incident to the vertex. This can be visualized as making a spherical cut or scoop, centered on the vertex. The cut surface or vertex figure is thus a spherical polygon marked on this sphere. One advantage of this method is that the shape of the vertex figure is fixed (up to the scale of the sphere), whereas the method of intersecting with a plane can produce different shapes depending on the angle of the plane. Additionally, this method works for non-convex polyhedra.

===As the set of connected vertices===
Many combinatorial and computational approaches (e.g. Skilling, 1975) treat a vertex figure as the ordered (or partially ordered) set of points of all the neighboring (connected via an edge) vertices to the given vertex.

===Abstract definition===
In the theory of abstract polytopes, the vertex figure at a given vertex &quot;V&quot; comprises all the elements which are incident on the vertex; edges, faces, etc. More formally it is the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-section &quot;Fn&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, where &quot;Fn&quot; is the greatest face.

This set of elements is elsewhere known as a &quot;vertex star&quot;. The geometrical vertex figure and the vertex star may be understood as distinct &quot;realizations&quot; of the same abstract section.

==General properties==
A vertex figure of an &quot;n&quot;-polytope is an (&quot;n&quot;−1)-polytope. For example, a vertex figure of a polyhedron is a polygon, and the vertex figure for a 4-polytope is a polyhedron.

In general a vertex figure need not be planar.

For nonconvex polyhedra, the vertex figure may also be nonconvex. Uniform polytopes, for instance, can have star polygons for faces and/or for vertex figures.

===Isogonal figures===
Vertex figures are especially significant for uniforms and other isogonal (vertex-transitive) polytopes because one vertex figure can define the entire polytope.

For polyhedra with regular faces, a vertex figure can be represented in vertex configuration notation, by listing the faces in sequence around the vertex. For example 3.4.4.4 is a vertex with one triangle and three squares, and it defines the uniform rhombicuboctahedron.

If the polytope is isogonal, the vertex figure will exist in a hyperplane surface of the &quot;n&quot;-space.

==Constructions==
===From the adjacent vertices===
By considering the connectivity of these neighboring vertices, a vertex figure can be constructed for each vertex of a polytope:
*Each vertex of the &quot;vertex figure&quot; coincides with a vertex of the original polytope.
*Each edge of the &quot;vertex figure&quot; exists on or inside of a face of the original polytope connecting two alternate vertices from an original face.
*Each face of the &quot;vertex figure&quot; exists on or inside a cell of the original &quot;n&quot;-polytope (for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 3).
*... and so on to higher order elements in higher order polytopes.

===Dorman Luke construction===
For a uniform polyhedron, the face of the dual polyhedron may be found from the original polyhedron&#x27;s vertex figure using the &quot;Dorman Luke&quot; construction.

===Regular polytopes===

If a polytope is regular, it can be represented by a Schläfli symbol and both the cell and the vertex figure can be trivially extracted from this notation.

In general a regular polytope with Schläfli symbol {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;...,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;} has cells as {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;...,&quot;y&quot;}, and &quot;vertex figures&quot; as {&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;...,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;}.
#For a regular polyhedron {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}, the vertex figure is {&quot;q&quot;}, a &quot;q&quot;-gon.
#*Example, the vertex figure for a cube {4,3}, is the triangle {3}.
#For a regular 4-polytope or space-filling tessellation {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;}, the vertex figure is {&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;}.
#*Example, the vertex figure for a hypercube {4,3,3}, the vertex figure is a regular tetrahedron {3,3}.
#*Also the vertex figure for a cubic honeycomb {4,3,4}, the vertex figure is a regular octahedron {3,4}.

Since the dual polytope of a regular polytope is also regular and represented by the Schläfli symbol indices reversed, it is easy to see the dual of the vertex figure is the cell of the dual polytope. For regular polyhedra, this is a special case of the Dorman Luke construction.

==An example vertex figure of a honeycomb==

The vertex figure of a truncated cubic honeycomb is a nonuniform square pyramid. One octahedron and four truncated cubes meet at each vertex form a space-filling tessellation.
==Edge figure==

Related to the &quot;vertex figure&quot;, an &quot;edge figure&quot; is the &quot;vertex figure&quot; of a &quot;vertex figure&quot;. Edge figures are useful for expressing relations between the elements within regular and uniform polytopes.

An &quot;edge figure&quot; will be a (&quot;n&quot;−2)-polytope, representing the arrangement of facets around a given edge. Regular and single-ringed coxeter diagram uniform polytopes will have a single edge type. In general, a uniform polytope can have as many edge types as active mirrors in the construction, since each active mirror produces one edge in the fundamental domain.

Regular polytopes (and honeycombs) have a single &quot;edge figure&quot; which is also regular. For a regular polytope {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;...,&quot;z&quot;}, the &quot;edge figure&quot; is {&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;...,&quot;z&quot;}.

In four dimensions, the edge figure of a 4-polytope or 3-honeycomb is a polygon representing the arrangement of a set of facets around an edge. For example, the &quot;edge figure&quot; for a regular cubic honeycomb {4,3,4} is a square, and for a regular 4-polytope {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;} is the polygon {&quot;r&quot;}.

Less trivially, the truncated cubic honeycomb t0,1{4,3,4}, has a square pyramid vertex figure, with truncated cube and octahedron cells. Here there are two types of &quot;edge figures&quot;. One is a square edge figure at the apex of the pyramid. This represents the four &quot;truncated cubes&quot; around an edge. The other four edge figures are isosceles triangles on the base vertices of the pyramid. These represent the arrangement of two truncated cubes and one octahedron around the other edges.

<text>Kobuleti (, ) is a town in Adjara, western Georgia, situated on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. It is the seat of Kobuleti Municipality and a seaside resort. It was known as &quot;Çürüksu&quot; during Ottoman rule.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the south-western part of Georgia, i.e. the northern part of the Autonomous Republic of Ajara. It borders with Ozurgeti Region to the north. The Regional centre is Kobuleti City, which stretches along the Black Sea shore.

After the civil wars of 1990–1993, the once sophisticated sanatoriums remained abandoned and plundered until 2004. In the meantime Kobuleti has developed into an upscale tourist center again.

Kobuleti Region consists of one municipal, two district and seventeen village councils. There are 48 villages in the region. Representatives of 24 different nationalities live together with Georgians in the region. Kobuleti is known with its traditions, hospitality, climatic areas, mild subtropical climate, ionized maritime air, bright shining sun and warm sea. The unique pebbly beach widely inclined to the sea is noted with its marvelous views beautified by sky-scraped endemic pine trees, eucalypts, bamboo, cypress grove, date and cocoa palms.

===Climate===
==Nature==
The Kintrishi and Tikeri reserve areas are unique with their bio-diversity. One can find rare flora in the Ispani marsh.

The surrounding region has diverse soil: seashore lowland is rich in peatbog soil. There are alpine rocks in the highlands, red soil is found in the hill areas. The mountainous area is good for subtropical species.

Kobuleti has several rivers. The most important ones are the Kintrishi River, the Chakvistskali River, the Acharistskali River, the Ochkhamuri River, the Achkva River, and the Dekhva River.

Kintrishi Protected Landscape and Kobuleti Managed Reserve are located in Kobuleti.

<text>Interstate 555 (I-555) is an Interstate Highway connecting I-55 in Turrell with Highway 91 in Jonesboro. It provides a complete freeway corridor between Jonesboro, Arkansas&#x27;s fifth-largest city, and Memphis, Tennessee. Formerly known as U.S. Route 63 (US 63), the highway was converted in the early 2000s to Interstate Highway standards. I-555 was dedicated in March 2016.

==Route description==

I-555 begins at an interchange of I-55, US 61, and AR 77 in Turrell. I-55 goes south to Memphis, Tennessee. The road parallel to the Interstate, AR 463, is a former alignment of US 63. I-555 passes through farmland and Gilmore. Then, it passes through Tyronza and Marked Tree. The section between Marked Tree and Payneway is also used for farm equipment vehicles to drive on. Next, it passes through Trumann before entering Jonesboro. It briefly has an overlap with US 49. I-555 ends in Jonesboro at an interchange with AR 91; from there, the road continues as US 63.

==History==
The I-555 route was approved on January 10, 2001, consisting of a widened section of US 63 between Turrell to Jonesboro to Interstate Highway standards. A few mainline bridges between Marked Tree and Turrell are from original two-lane US 63 and are narrower than current standards, but I-530 was approved in 1999 despite having a similar issue.

The last requirement to formally designate this route as I-555 was the construction of a parallel access road across a floodway between Payneway and Marked Tree, so that farm equipment would no longer have to use US 63 to cross the floodway. No crossing has ever been built, but an exemption for agricultural vehicles was added to I-555 between Marked Tree and Payneway. The exemption was introduced by U.S. Representative Rick Crawford and passed as part of the House Transportation Bill on December 4, 2015. It was announced in December 2015 that I-555 would be officially designated in early 2016. In early 2016, signs along the section of the highway cautioned travelers that there may be farm equipment driving on the roadway. The road was officially dedicated on March 11, 2016, in Jonesboro. In 2021, US 63 was rerouted off the entire route of I-555, but a short extension on November 23 of that same year redesignated US 63 along a section of I-555 again.

==Future==
ARDOT is currently running studies that will determine whether improvements to interchanges and cross-streets are needed for I-555 in Craighead County. Public meetings about the study were held in December 2021 and October 2023. Comments about the study were also requested between October and December 2023.

<doc id="1005726" wikidata="Q7401059" url="?curid=1005726" title="Saint Boniface Church (New Vienna, Iowa)">
<text>Saint Boniface Church is the Catholic parish church for the city of New Vienna, Iowa and the surrounding area. It is a Gothic-style church, with stained glass windows, a handcarved main altar, and a striking spire The parish, part of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, is partnered with Ss. Peter and Paul Parish, Petersburg, Iowa - the two parishes share a pastor.

==History==

The history of the parish can be traced back to the 1840s when a number of German American families came to the area from Ohio in search of farmland. On January 6, 1846, Bishop Mathias Loras of Dubuque celebrated Mass at the home of Hermann Wiechmann, the first Mass celebrated in the New Vienna area. For the next two years, Mass was celebrated at the Wiechmann home.

In 1848, the first permanent structure was built. This wood building measured by and had walls that were high.

By 1853, the population had increased to the point that a new structure was needed. Construction of this new church was completed in 1855. The church was 64 by with -high walls. A local resident, William Steffen Sr., was sent with two teams of horses to get three bells for the church. He arrived back in New Vienna just before Easter; the bells were raised in time to chime for the first time on Easter Sunday. This second structure was used until 1887.

In 1887, the third and present building was completed. This building is long by wide. The walls are high. The stained glass windows are wide by high. The steeple is high.

The church has five altars made of carved wood which are still present in the church today. The old high altar was built by E. Hackner of La Crosse, Wisconsin. This altar cost $5,000.

The organ was built in 1891 by the Schuelke Organ Company. The organ at St. Boniface is one of the few intact Schuelke organs that still exist today. Aside from regular maintenance, the organ has remained basically unaltered over the years. One of the few alterations made to the organ was the addition of an electric blower in the 20th century.

In 2010 workers began constructing a new entryway on the north side of the church when a sinkhole that was 12 feet wide and 8 feet deep was discovered in the basement. It is not known when the sinkhole formed, but if it had taken out a nearby pillar it could have caused the church building to collapse.

==School==
Saint Boniface previously had its own parish school, Saint Boniface School, which started operations in 1847. Classes were initially held in private residences before being held inside the church facility. It received a permanent school building in 1870. The school moved into the church in 1922, and a new school building opened in 1924.

In 1987 it consolidated into Archbishop Hennessy Catholic School, which had two locations: grades K-3 in New Vienna, and preschool and 4-6 in Petersburg. It served as the joint parish school for Saint Boniface as well as Saints Peter and Paul Church in Petersburg. Enrollment was over 100 at that time. The school had a relationship with Beckman Catholic High School in Dyersville. In 2013 the school consolidated all grades into its Petersburg location. Its enrollment at that time was 60. Enrollments consistently decreased prior to 2017: by 2017 the school only had 45 students. Archbishop Hennessy closed in 2018.

The remaining Catholic grade school in the &quot;Spires of Faith&quot; Catholic church network is St. Francis Xavier Catholic School in Dyersville.

Two singles from that album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me (When I&#x27;m Gone)&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot;, reached the U.S. top 10.

==History==
In Newmarket, Ontario, vocalist Alan Frew and bassist Wayne Parker (both from local band Onyx), along with keyboardist Sam Reid (from River Drive Park band The End), along with then drummer Michael Hanson formed a new band called Tokyo. Guitarist Al Connelly joined the band in 1983.

In 1986, Glass Tiger released its first album, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;; it was produced by Jim Vallance (who co-wrote two songs) and Bryan Adams made a memorable vocal cameo on the lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me (When I&#x27;m Gone)&quot;. This album went quadruple platinum in Canada and gold in the United States. Two of its songs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me (When I&#x27;m Gone)&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot;, reached the Top 10 in the U.S. charts. Glass Tiger won three 1986 Juno Awards: Album of the Year for &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, Single of the Year for &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me (When I&#x27;m Gone)&quot;, and Most Promising Group of the Year. The album&#x27;s producer, Jim Vallance, was named Composer of the Year. The band won two more Juno Awards in 1987 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The band performed in the United States as part of Journey’s Raised on Radio Tour and on Tina Turner&#x27;s European Break Every Rule Tour.

The band released a second album, &quot;Diamond Sun&quot;, in 1988. The album was certified triple platinum in Canada and featured the single &quot;I&#x27;m Still Searching&quot;, which peaked at #2 in Canada. Hanson left the band in 1988 following the release of &quot;Diamond Sun&quot;.

<doc id="1005732" wikidata="Q5004362" url="?curid=1005732" title="Byron Galvez">
<text>Byron Gálvez (October 28, 1941 – October 27, 2009) was a Mexican artist who was primarily known for his painting but also created sculpture, including monumental works. He was born in rural Hidalgo state, to a father who played jazz music and read literature, a rarity in 1930s rural Mexico. However, it exposed Gálvez to culture, even though this led to an interest in visual art rather than musing or writing. He went to Mexico City to study art at both the undergraduate and graduate level, but never completed his degrees, opting instead to begin career after his coursework. Before his first individual exhibition, his work was criticized by Justino Fernández, but all of the paintings were sold in advance to foreign buyers including American actor Vincent Price, who called Gálvez a “Mexican Picasso.” Gálvez then managed to replace the forty five paintings for the exhibition in a week. Since then he had individual and collective exhibitions in Mexico, the United States and other parts of the world. He concentrated on painting, which he is better known for, in the 1970s and 1980s, but moved on to sculpture, including monumental works later in his career. Recognitions for Gálvez&#x27;s work include membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and two books published about his life.

==Life==
Gálvez was born in Mixquiahuala, Hidalgo and described his childhood as happy, and would not have changed it. His father, Roberto Gálvez, was a farmer and merchant, who was a music and literature enthusiast, a rarity is 1930s rural Mexico. His father played the violin in the town&#x27;s jazz band, which had almost all classical instruments, making it similar to bands in New Orleans. They even composed new pieces. The artist was named after Lord Byron, and his brothers, Eliot, Aníbal and Dante, after his father&#x27;s reading preferences.

This meant that Gálvez grew up in an environment that encouraged the enjoyment of the arts. However, instead of music or literature, Gálvez stated that his earliest memories related to his attraction to art and that he always wanted to be a painter. The difficulties of farm life convinced him that he needed an education and would have to move to Mexico City in order to go to school. At age sixteen he left home for the capital to study painting at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas, not knowing what the study would entail. It was far more rigorous than he expected, with thirteen-hour school days leaving only weekends to earn money to live on. He did his undergraduate studies from 1958 to 1962, then continued with the graduate courses from 1962 to 1964, specializing in painting. He did much of his studies under teachers such as Luis Nishizawa, Fernando Castro Pacheco, Francisco Moreno Capdevila, Santos Balmori, Antonio Rodríguez Luna and Antonio Ramírez. The last teacher taught him to love his studies above all else and he submitted himself to the academic rigor. This led him to become attracted to the Cubism of Picasso, and felt that the artist has opened roads which could be taken and widened. Although he specialized in painting, his interest in sculpture was also evident at this time as he was a founding member of a metal sculpture workshop at the institution along with Armando Ortega and Baltazar Martinez. Although he completed his coursework, he did not finish the other requirements needed for the degree, instead opting to start his career.

After he started his artistic career, he continued to develop as an artist, taking trip to Europe on various occasions to visit art museums and places such as Stonehenge .

Gálvez married once to art dealer Eva Beloglovsky. The couple first met in 1973, but did not meet again until two years later, when Beloglovsky bought one of his paintings and sold two more through her art gallery. At first it was a working relationship, and then evolved into a romantic one. During their marriage, they worked on a number of projects together such as multi-media presentations and charity benefits. The couple remained together until Galvez&#x27;s death.

Although he began and developed much of his career in Mexico City, in his later life, the artist moved back to his rural hometown. Gálvez constructed a house and studio on the edge of a ravine in which flows the Moctezuma River. The structure has glass walls positioned for maximum light and a privileged view of a local landmark, a hill called El Elefante.

Galvez died at age 67 at Inglés Observatorio Hospital from a heart attack. His ashes were deposited a year after his death to the side of one of the sculptures at his home in Mixquiahuala.

==Career==

Gálvez is best known for his oils on canvas. During his career, he exhibited individually and collectively in over sixty venues in Mexico, various cities in the United States, Europe and Latin America. In 1964, he had his first individual exhibition at the ENAP Gallery, after showing in collective exhibitions at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and private galleries along with more prominent painters such as José Chávez Morado, Alfredo Zalce, José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, Carlos Orozco Romero and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Before the opening of this exhibit, his work was severely criticized by art historian Justino Fernández. Despite this, the paintings for the exhibit were bought in advance, most by American actor Vincent Price, who called Gálvez a “Mexican Picasso.” The paintings were taken out of the country one week before the exhibit, but Gálvez was not concerned about not having paintings for the show, rather he was satisfied about his work being recognized and supported. He managed to create forty five more paintings in the remaining time in order to have the exhibit.

After this individual exhibit, Gálvez had over 55 more over his career, along with participating in 75 collective exhibits. Important exhibits include the Solar 68 collective exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1968), the Sterenberg Galleries, Chicago (1972), Eye Corporation in various US cities (1973), Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros (1978), Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City (1982), Harcourts Contemporary Gallery in San Francisco (1983, 1990), Art-Forum Gallery in Mexico City (1984), Bishop Gallery in Phoenix (1989), Merryl Chase Gallery in Washington, DC (1991, 1992), Suhan Galleries in San Diego (1992), Misrachi Gallery (1994) and San Francisco Theater in Pachuca (1995) . After his death, the Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores sponsored an exhibition of his work in Tainan, Taiwan in 2011.

His works can be found in major collections in both Mexico and the United States. The strongest demand has been for his figurative work especially that produced later in his life.

Gálvez also created murals and sculptures, both small and monumental. His first mural was sculpted done in 1968 in Los Angeles. However, most of his monumental work was produced later in his career as he concentrated on painting in the 1970s and 1980s. These include a mural at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City (1970), a thirty-foot high sculpture in Unidad Morelos in Mexico City (1971), a hand hammered copper triptych for a private residence in Mexico City (1984), a sculpted door for a private residence (1985), a sculpture for a private home in New York (1986), Reclined Torso at the Hotel Nikko Mexico (1998), Torso I a five-foot high sculpture for the city of Pachuca (1999), Torso II a nineteen foot high sculpture at the Altiva Building, Mexico City (1999), Millennium, a bronze sculpture/fountain at the highway entrance to Pachuca (2000), a sculpture garden for Mixquiahuala, Hidalgo (2005) and the master plan and central mosaic for the David Ben Gurion Cultural Park in Pachuca (2005) . The park project, the last before his death, included not only the creation of the central mosaic, the largest pedestrian mural in the world at 345,000ft2, but also the design of the 65-acre park itself.

His other activities included the teaching of drawing at his alma mater, the creation of a program for the radio ministry of Mexico in 1973, participation in a documentary about lithography in Mexico in 1980 and the creation of several special programs for the office Radio, Television and Cinematography. In 1995, he was appointed as a member of the Consejo Nacional de Arte y Cultura of the state of Hidalgo. In 1997, he participated in a cultural exchange with the Valparaíso Foundation of Spain.

Galvez received over fifteen awards and honorary tributes during his lifetime. Recognitions for his work include first prize in sculpture in a competition organized by the Ford company in 1966, first prize in sculpture from the Instituto Nacional de Juventud in 1967, honorable mention from a contest promoted by the Comisión Federal de Acero in Mexico City (1971) and first place at the Salon Annual de la Plástica Mexicana in Mexico City in 1972, 1975 and 1986. In 1968, he became a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. In 1996, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a retrospective called Semblanza de 30 años. Two books published about his life in 1982 and 1997. After his death, his hometown named their cultural center after him, and he was awarded a merit medal posthumously by the governor of the state.

==Artistry==

Gálvez&#x27;s work included painting, sculpture, etching, lithography, and drawing. For Galvez, art was spiritual and disconnected with physical logic, when only aesthetics mattered. Female figures are common, and often are sensual. He work has been influenced by the Cubism of Picasso and Georges Braque, by African and Oceanic folk art and by pre-Columbian sculpture. He preferred large scale works often bigger than seven by seven feet. He painted while listening to classical, jazz and occasionally, rock music.

Galvez&#x27;s work experienced periods in which different artistic currents dominated including expressionism, abstract art and mixtures of the two. In his work, he tried to achieve a balance between figurative and abstract expression. The first stage of his painting was figurative expressionism, then abstract expressionism, under strong influence of Carlos Mérida, Rufino Tamaho, Santos Balmori, Kandinsky, Wifredo Lam and Picasso, along with some from classical painters such as Rembrandt and Caravaggio . Then for some time, he practiced abstract art, but then felt the need to draw human bodies again, especially female ones because he felt it allowed him better expression. Around 1980, he moved on to geometric figurativism, marked by the “Woman” exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. This has also been describes as “pure chromatic constructivism.” He considered himself primarily a sculptor and painted in that fashion.

Despite their abstract quality, his paintings have an intense romanticism which arises from a mixture of nostalgia and affection, showing the influence of Rodríguez Luna and Santos Balmori. His use of color and texture shows influence from the work of Rufino Tamayo with many works showing the forms of Picasso and the color schemes of Tamayo. He considered Picasso to be the greatest artist of all time. (vision) He works in “cold colors” and used chiaroscuro (a technique from Rembrandt) to indicate movement.

As student he specialized in painting but he also created sculpture and monumental pieces. During the 1970s and 1980s, he concentrated on painting but never left sculpture completely. He began doing sculpture though his work with murals, with his initial sculptural work showing the influence of Manuel Felguérez (seen in later pieces as well) with sculptures evolving from two dimensional to three. His European travels influenced his sculptural work with exposure to the works of Henry Moore, Brâncuși and Chillida. A visit to Stonehenge influenced his sense of space and Mesoamerican influence comes by way of his cultural heritage. His sculptural work is mostly in metals, with both geometric and figurative designs, which include reliefs and bronze sculptures. There are also mixed-media pieces such as metal fountain work on a mosaic base. Latter sculptures often feature feminine figures that float in space, gazing upon the onlooker and often sensuous. His sculpting work influenced his painting and vice versa.

<text>Dom Jean Mabillon , (; 23 November 1632 – 27 December 1707) was a French Benedictine monk and scholar of the Congregation of Saint Maur. He is considered the founder of the disciplines of palaeography and diplomatics.

==Early life==
Mabillon was born in the town of Saint-Pierremont, then in the ancient Province of Champagne, now a part of the Department of Ardennes. He was the son of Estienne Mabillon and his wife Jeanne Guérin. At the age of 12 he became a pupil at the Collège des Bons Enfants in Reims. Having entered the seminary in 1650, he left after three years and in 1653 became instead a monk in the Maurist Abbey of Saint-Remi. There his dedication to his studies left him ill, and in 1658 he was sent to Corbie Abbey to regain his strength. He was ordained at Corbie in 1660.

In 1663 he was transferred again to Saint-Denis Abbey near Paris, and the following year to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. This was a move which offered wide opportunities for scholarly acquaintances and Mabillon was to meet and work, among others, with Luc d&#x27;Achery, Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange, Étienne Baluze, and Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont.

==As editor and compiler==
At Saint-Germain, Mabillon prepared an edition of the works of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (published in 1667), and also worked on a monumental collection of the lives of the Benedictine Saints, under the title &quot;Acta Ordinis S. Benedicti&quot; (published in nine volumes between 1668 and 1701). The later work was undertaken in collaboration with Dom Luc d&#x27;Achery. This monk had long been the librarian of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and was senior to Mabillon. It was upon historical materials which d&#x27;Achery had collected that Mabillon drew for his &quot;Acta&quot;. A foreword subsequently added by Mabillon used the lives of the saints in order to illustrate the history of the early Middle Ages.

==&quot;De re diplomatica&quot;==

In 1681, prompted by the doubts raised by the Jesuit Daniel van Papenbroek over the authenticity of supposed Merovingian documents held at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, Mabillon published his &quot;De re diplomatica&quot;. This work investigated different types of medieval documents and manuscripts, including scrutiny of their script, style, seals, signatures, &quot;testimonia&quot;, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, using an acquired &quot;taste&quot; derived from long experience, and consulting the views of other document scholars. Manuscripts from many archives are addressed, and references made to items dating back to Dagobert I (King of the Franks, c. 629–639). Concerned often with &quot;distinguishing genuine documents from forgeries&quot; the work is now seen as the foundation work of palaeography and diplomatics. Mabillon writes:

I do not deny that in fact some documents are false and others interpolated, but all of them should not be dismissed for that reason. Rather, it is necessary to devise and hand down rules for distinguishing genuine manuscripts from those that are false and interpolated. ... I undertook this task after long familiarity and daily experience with these documents. For almost twenty years I had devoted my studies and energies to reading and examining ancient manuscripts and archives, and the published collections of ancient documents. ... I compared and weighed them with one another that I might be able to compile a body of knowledge which was not merely scanty and meager, but as accurate and as well-tested as possible in a field which had not been previously investigated.

This work brought Mabillon to the attention of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who offered him a pension (which he declined), and King Louis XIV. He began to travel throughout Europe, to Flanders, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, in search of medieval manuscripts and books for the royal library.

==Criticism==
Some of the less scholarly monks in Mabillon&#x27;s own abbey criticized his &quot;Lives&quot; for being too academic; while Armand de Rancé, Abbot of La Trappe, declared that he was breaking the rules of his Order by devoting his life to study rather than manual labour. He also caused trouble by denouncing the veneration of the relics of &quot;unknown saints&quot;, wrote a controversial critique of the works of St. Augustine of Hippo, and was accused of Jansenism, but at all times he was supported by the king and the Church.

==Later career and legacy==

In 1701 Mabillon was appointed by the king as one of the founding members of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and in 1704 a supplement to &quot;De re diplomatica&quot; was published. In 1707 he died and was buried in the church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in Paris.

According to Fritz Stern, writing in 1956, Mabillon was the &quot;greatest historical scholar of his century&quot;. 
The Mabillon station of the Paris Métro is named after him.

He attended Glen Rock High School where he produced a musical revue starring the school&#x27;s janitorial staff. Vivino began his live performance career working as a child tap dancer in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and began his broadcast career over a friend&#x27;s pirate radio station while in high school.

Vivino is the older brother of Jerry Vivino and Jimmy Vivino, who were members of the Basic Cable Band, formerly known as the Max Weinberg 7. Vivino is also the uncle of musical theater actress Donna Vivino.

==Career==

===&quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot;===
&quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; aired in New Jersey and New York from 1974 to 1998. It can be read as a children&#x27;s show or a parody of a children&#x27;s show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of shows by predecessor Soupy Sales (1950s-1970s), and later Pee-wee Herman (1980s). The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Vivino&#x27;s piano playing. One of Vivino&#x27;s puppet sidekicks – actually a ventriloquial figure – was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue Öyster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Vivino&#x27;s program.

The show made its debut on UA-Columbia Cable TV of New Jersey, now part of Cablevision, on January 29, 1974. Beginning in November 1974 it aired on UHF-TV station WBTB-TV, Newark, broadcasting on channels 68 and 60, which later became WTVG, then WWHT, as the station&#x27;s ownership changed.

The show&#x27;s first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, Bob D. Caterino – known for his Groucho Marx skits, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig &quot;Mugsy&quot; Calam, Richard &quot;Netto&quot; Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art &quot;Looney Skip&quot; Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David &quot;Artie Delmar&quot; Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show Album&quot;, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979–83. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist.

In 1982, &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago, WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston and WHCT-TV Channel 18 in Hartford. It aired right after &quot;SCTV&quot; on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable.

From 1983 to 1986, &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton).

Starting in late 1986, &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (&quot;The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey&quot;). During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Vivino sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Vivino also hosted a show called &quot;Uncle Floyd&#x27;s New Jersey&quot;, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state.

First-run production of &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel&#x27;s demise in 1999.

From 1992 until 1996, cast member Mugsy produced and appeared in a spin-off show entitled &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. The show was written and produced in the same vein as &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot;. It was broadcast live from studios in Nutley, New Jersey on the statewide CTN cable network, and on two Northern New Jersey public access channels, Cablevision of Oakland and Suburban Cablevision of New Jersey in East Orange (later acquired by Comcast Corporation).
In 1998, production of &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.

===Other work===
Vivino has appeared on several television shows filmed in New York City including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;100 Centre Street&quot;, and &quot;Cosby&quot;, and was a regular on the Sirius Satellite Radio program &quot;The Wiseguys Show&quot; on Raw Dog Comedy (channel 104) hosted by former &quot;The Sopranos&quot; cast member Vincent Pastore. Vivino performed the jingle of, as well as appeared in the TV commercial for, the frontier-themed amusement park &quot;Wild West City&quot;, located in Netcong, New Jersey, a jingle that is still used today by the park. He has also had parts in the movies &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Crazy People&quot; and &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;. He also shot a scene for &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot; which was deleted. In 2000, Vivino played the bit part of an announcer in the Insane Clown Posse movie, &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot;.

From 1987 to 2013, Vivino broadcast on WVIP-FM 93.5 radio from New Rochelle, New York, where he played a wide range of Italian music on his Sunday afternoon program, &quot;The Italian-American Serenade&quot;. He claims to have the largest collection of Italian records in the world. The program was revived on sister station WVOX 1460 AM in September 2018.

In 1999, Vivino set a world record for non-stop piano playing, having played for 24 hours and 15 minutes in a charity event to raise money for a sick child. In more than 40 years in show business, Vivino has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for various charities and causes.

In April 2013, &quot;Uncle Floyd&#x27;s Garage Sale Music&quot; began on WVOX 1460 in New Rochelle, the sister station to his former radio outlet, WVIP. This show features an eclectic variety of records from Vivino&#x27;s large personal collection, most of which he found in thrift shops, yard sales and curbside garbage piles. The program also features discussion between Vivino and co-host Scott Gordon about the music and artists whose recordings are heard on the show, many of whom Vivino worked with personally during his long career. There are also segments featuring written comments and questions submitted by listeners. Beginning in June 2014, a second weekly &quot;Garage Sale Music&quot; program began airing and streaming on Sundays 9:00-Noon over WFDU 89.1 FM in Teaneck, New Jersey. The WVOX program ended in September 2018, returning to The Italian-American Serenade format.

In January 2013, Vivino began the internet-based radio program &quot;The Uncle Floyd Radio Show&quot; which can be streamed twice a week from the show&#x27;s website and through various SHOUTcast mobile apps and links.

Vivino was selected to be the vocalist on Vince Giordano&#x27;s 2020 recording of Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27; but was replaced by Loudon Wainwright III due to a conflicting appearance commitment.

Vivino hosted and starred in &quot;The Last Authentic American Traveling Burlesque Show&quot;, a tribute to the lost entertainment style of burlesque.

Starting in November 2020, Vivino, along with long-time collaborator, Scott Gordon, began live-streaming old episodes and segments from Gordon&#x27;s archive of 700 hours of video. These can be seen on StageIt on the internet at StageIt.com/SGE-Inc every Tuesday night at 8:00PM Eastern time.

==Tributes==
The first band to refer to &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; in a song was the Johnny Gork Band from Flemington, New Jersey in the early 1980s, released on a 45 rpm single. Johnny and the band appeared on the show, during which Uncle Floyd said he was honored and humbled to have a band produce a record about the show.

David Bowie, a fan of Vivino&#x27;s television show, recorded the song &quot;Slip Away&quot; on his 2002 album, &quot;Heathen&quot;, as a tribute. The lyrics mention Uncle Floyd and his puppets &quot;Oogie&quot; and &quot;Bones Boy&quot;. When asked how he had learned of the show, Bowie replied &quot;John Lennon told me about it.&quot; He has also mentioned Iggy Pop regularly watching the show. While in Berlin in 2002 touring for his &quot;Heathen&quot; album, Bowie said &quot;This is another new song. It&#x27;s about a television hero in America from &#x27;70s that myself, and Lennon and Iggy Pop used to watch in the afternoons. Crazy guy, and we were very addled and used to love fooling around watching this guy Uncle Floyd. And his song is called &quot;Slip Away&quot;. This story is also told in the 2024 documentary &quot;Flipside&quot;, which features Uncle Floyd.

The song &quot;Work for Food&quot; by Dramarama, on the 1994 album &quot;Hi-Fi Sci-Fi&quot; features the &quot;Uncle Floyd Show&quot; in the lyrics. Footage of Vivino as Cowboy Charlie also appears in the video for the song. The members of Dramarama were from Wayne, New Jersey and made their first television appearance on &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot;.

The Ramones also recognized &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show &quot;in their song &quot;It&#x27;s Not My Place (In the Nine to Five World)&quot;, as well as in various live appearances. Also, Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone could often be seen wearing an &quot;Uncle Floyd Show&quot; T-shirt in pictures of the band, while Joey Ramone often wore an &quot;Uncle Floyd&quot; Show button on his leather jacket.

==Personal life==
In April 2022, Vivino revealed that he had been diagnosed with cancer in both his bladder and prostate. In July 2023, Vivino suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. A full recovery was expected.

<doc id="1005745" wikidata="Q1138058" url="?curid=1005745" title="Doliolida">
<text>The Doliolida are an order of small marine chordates of the subphylum Tunicata. They are in the class Thaliacea, which also includes the salps and pyrosomes. The doliolid body is small, typically 1–2 mm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide siphons, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular muscle strands reminiscent of barrel bands.

Like all tunicates, except for the predatory tunicate, they are filter feeders. Unlike the related class Ascidiacea, which are sessile, but like the class Appendicularia, they are free-swimming plankton; cilia pump water through the body which drives them forward. As the water passes through, small particles and plankton on which the animal feeds are strained from the water by the gill slits. Doliolids can also move by contracting the muscular bands around the body creating a temporary water jet that thrusts them forward or backward quite quickly.

The Doliolida have a complicated life cycle that includes sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species do occur as far to the north as northern California.

==Life cycle==
Doliolids alternate through sexual and asexual generations. The sexual generation consists of individuals featuring eight muscle bands, each having male or female gonads. These individuals are called gonozooids. Fertilized eggs produce slightly different individuals, featuring nine muscle bands, no gonads, and two stalks growing from each individual&#x27;s body: the shorter one at the ventral side, and the longer one growing from the dorsal edge of the posterior siphon. These asexual individuals are informally called &quot;nurses&quot;, and each one produces an astonishing number of mature progeny asexually; such progeny include both sexual and asexual zooids in three sequential &quot;generations&quot;.

The nurse produces buds (which grow into new zooids) in its ventral stalk, but the buds grow and mature on its dorsal stalk. Each bud is an aggregate of a few dozen cells, and the way it gets to its final place is the first peculiarity of doliolid reproduction. Buds are immobile, but are actively carried by special mobile cells, called phorocytes, which literally means &quot;carrier cells&quot;, shaped like amoebae. Each bud is transported by several phorocytes, which follow a clearly defined path across the nurse&#x27;s body: up the ventral stalk, in a spiral along the left side of the &quot;barrel&quot;, and finally onto and along the dorsal stalk.

The first buds grow in pairs on either side of the dorsal stalk. They develop into zooids not unlike the nurse, each attached to its dorsal stalk with its own dorsal stalk. These zooids differ from the individual independent adult; their intake siphons are so much wider than the rear that the individual zooid is spoon-shaped rather than barrel-shaped. The spoon-shaped zooids supply food for the whole colony via a common blood circulation along two blood-filled sinuses that extend from the nurse along the whole length of the dorsal stalk. As this first generation grows, the nurse&#x27;s feeding role is gradually diminished, and at the point where the colony&#x27;s nutrition is supplied by the stalk zooids the nurse loses most of its organs, becoming a purely generative and propulsive agent, dragging its huge grape-like stalk behind it.

As the dorsal stalk grows and more zooids grow along its sides, the phorocytes begin to grow a second batch of buds in two more rows between the first two, on the dorsal side of the stalk. These grow into asexual zooids that are smaller, are barrel-shaped like the nurse, and are attached to the nurse&#x27;s stalk with their ventral stalks. They do not have a dorsal stalk themselves. Because of their later function, members of this generation are called phorozooids, which means &quot;carrier zooids&quot;.

Finally, when the two phorozooid rows on the nurse&#x27;s stalk are filled up and the first phorozooids grow big enough, the phorocytes begin to plant subsequent buds on the stalks of phorozooids, which are still attached to the main colony at this point. Only this third batch of buds eventually grows into gonozooids - the sexual generation.

As phorozooids mature, their stalks detach from the nurse&#x27;s stalk, and they swim away on their own, carrying budding gonozooids on their own stalks. The nurse and its battery of feeding zooids goes on until all carriers leave, and then the whole colony dies off. The carriers go on as long as it is required for the gonozooids on their stalks to grow and detach, and then they die off too.

Gonozooids detached from the phorozooid swim free, mate, and produce fertilized eggs - from which spring the next generation of asexual zooid &quot;factories&quot;, and the cycle repeats. The total number of zooids produced by a single nurse colony can reach tens of thousands - explosive growth unusual in the animal kingdom.

==Natural enemies==
The gelatinous doliolid &quot;Dolioletta gegenbauri&quot; is preyed upon by the copepod &quot;Sapphirina nigromaculata&quot; that chews through and enters its body cavity and then ingests its internal tissues.

<text>A supercritical flow is a flow whose velocity is larger than the wave velocity. The analogous condition in gas dynamics is supersonic speed.

According to the website Civil Engineering Terms, supercritical flow is defined as follows: 
The flow at which depth of the channel is less than critical depth, velocity of flow is greater than critical velocity and slope of the channel is also greater than the critical slope is known as supercritical flow.

Information travels at the wave velocity. This is the velocity at which waves travel outwards from a pebble thrown into a lake. The flow velocity is the velocity at which a leaf in the flow travels. If a pebble is thrown into a supercritical flow then the ripples will all move down stream whereas in a subcritical flow some would travel up stream and some would travel down stream. It is only in supercritical flows that hydraulic jumps (bores) can occur. In fluid dynamics, the change from one behaviour to the other is often described by a dimensionless quantity, where the transition occurs whenever this number becomes less or more than one. One of these numbers is the Froude number:

* formula_1
where
* &quot;U&quot; = velocity of the flow
* &quot;g&quot; = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s² or 32.2 ft/s²)
* &quot;h&quot; = depth of flow relative to the channel bottom

If formula_2, we call the flow subcritical; if formula_3, we call the flow supercritical. If formula_4, it is critical.

<text>Toivo Aarne Loukola (2 October 1902 – 10 January 1984) was a Finnish male runner, winner of the 3000 metres steeplechase at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. Loukola set an unofficial world record in the steeplechase just a month before the Olympics.

In Amsterdam, Loukola first finished seventh in the 10,000 m race and then easily won his 3000 m steeplechase heat. In the final the main favourites were the Finns Paavo Nurmi, Ville Ritola and Loukola, but Nurmi and Ritola were worn by their injuries and the gruelling 5000 m race of the previous day. Although Ritola gave up soon, the Finns were still going to the first three places. After 2000 m, when Nurmi had trouble at hurdles, Loukola made an attack and developed a 30 m gap, which he would hold until the finish. Loukola won in a new world record of 9.21.8, finishing almost 10 seconds ahead of second-placed Nurmi.

Loukola also won 11 national titles, in the 5,000 m (1928–29), 10,000 m (1928–29, 1932 and 1936) and steeplechase (1928–32). He was a policeman by profession.

<doc id="1005748" wikidata="Q1457477" url="?curid=1005748" title="Megara Hyblaea">
<text>Megara Hyblaea () – perhaps identical with Hybla Major – is an ancient Greek colony of Magna Graecia in Sicily, situated near Augusta on the east coast, north-northwest of Syracuse, Italy, on the deep bay formed by the Xiphonian promontory. There were at least three (and possibly as many as five) cities named &quot;Hybla&quot; in ancient accounts of Sicily which are often confounded with each other, and among which it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish.

== History ==
It was unquestionably a Greek colony, deriving its origin from the Megara in Greece; and the circumstances attending its foundation are related in detail by Thucydides. He tells us that a colony from Megara, under the command of a leader named Lamis (), arrived in Sicily about the time that Leontini was founded by the Chalcidic colonists, and settled themselves first near the mouth of the river Pantagias, at a place called Trotilon (Latin: Trotilus, modern Brucoli). From there they removed to Leontini itself, where they dwelt for a time together with the Chalcidians; but were soon afterwards expelled by them, and next established themselves on the promontory or peninsula of Thapsos (Latin: Thapsus, modern Magnisi), near Syracuse. They again relocated after the death of Lamis, and, at the suggestion of Hyblon, a Sicilian chief of the surrounding country, finally settled at a place afterwards called the Hyblaean Megara. (Thuc. vi. 4.) Scymnus Chius follows a different tradition, as he describes the establishment of the Chalcidians at Naxos and that of the Megarians at Hybla as contemporary, and both preceding the foundation of Syracuse, 734 BC. Strabo also adopts the same view, representing Megara as founded about the same time with Naxos (735 BC), and before Syracuse. (Scymn. Ch. 271-76; Strab. vi. p. 269.) It is impossible to reconcile the two accounts, but that of Thucydides is probably the most trustworthy. Thus the foundation of Megara may be placed about 726 BC. Professor Miller, in her reinvestigation of ancient source materials has determined that they point to various dates of foundation from 758 BC (per the &quot;Chronikon&quot; of Eusebius) to 728 BC (from her reconstructions of dates from Thucydides). Of its earlier history we have scarcely any information, but it would appear to have attained a flourishing condition, as 100 years after its foundation it sent out, in its turn, a colony to the other end of Sicily, where it founded the city of Selinus, which was destined to rise to far greater power than its parent city. (Thuc. vi. 4; Scymn. Ch. 291; Strab. vi. p. 272.)

Nothing more is known of Megara till the period of its destruction by Gelon of Syracuse, about 483 BC, who, after a long siege, made himself master of the city by a capitulation; but, notwithstanding this, caused the bulk of the inhabitants to be sold into slavery, while he established the more wealthy and noble citizens at Syracuse. (Herod. vii. 156; Thuc. vi. 4.) Among the persons thus removed was the celebrated comic poet Epicharmus, who had received his education at Megara, though not a native of that city. (Suda, under ; Diogenes Laërtius viii. 3.) According to Thucydides, this event took place 245 years after the foundation of Megara, and may therefore be placed about 483 BC. It is certain that Megara never recovered its power and independence. Thucydides distinctly alludes to it as not existing in his time as a city, but repeatedly mentions the locality, on the sea-coast, which was at that time occupied by the Syracusans, but which the Athenian general Lamachus, during the expedition against Syracuse (415–413 BC), proposed to make the headquarters of their fleet; his advice was not taken, and the next spring the Syracusans fortified it. (Thuc. vi. 49, 96.)

From this time we meet with repeated mention of a place named Megara or Megaris (Scyl. p. 4. § 6), which it seems impossible to separate from Hybla, and it is probable that the two were, in fact, identical. The site of this later Megara or Hybla may be fixed, with little doubt, at the mouth of the river Alabus (modern Cantera); but there seems much reason to suppose that the ancient city, the original Greek colony, was situated close to the remarkable promontory now occupied by the city of Augusta. It is difficult to believe that this position, the port of which is at least equal to that of Syracuse, while the peninsula itself has the same advantages as that of Ortygia, should have been wholly neglected in ancient times; and such a station would have admirably served the purposes for which Lamachus urged upon his brother generals the occupation of the vacant site of Megara (Thuc. vi. 49.).

==Archaeology==

Excavations carried on in 1891 led to the discovery of the northern portion of the western town wall, which in one section served at the same time as an embankment against floods—it was apparently more conspicuous in the time of Philipp Cluver, (&quot;Sicilia antiqua&quot;, Leiden, 1619) p. 133—of an extensive necropolis, about 1500 tombs of which have been explored, and of a deposit of votive objects from a temple. The harbour lay to the north of the town.

In the mid-seventh century, the city was organised according to a regularised plan. An agora emerged with stoas on its north and eastern sides. This is one of the earliest known agoras.

<text>Hedley was a Canadian pop rock band that originated in Abbotsford, British Columbia, originally formed in 2003. They were named after the unincorporated community of Hedley, British Columbia, a name chosen after members heard that it was for sale for $346,000. After lead singer Jacob Hoggard placed third on the second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; in 2004, the group signed with Universal Music Canada and released their self-titled debut studio album the following year. Hedley saw commercial success with their subsequent studio albums, including &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; (2007), &quot;The Show Must Go&quot; (2009), &quot;Storms&quot; (2011), &quot;Wild Life&quot; (2013), &quot;Hello&quot; (2015) and &quot;Cageless&quot; (2017).

Following the release of their seventh studio album &quot;Cageless&quot; (2017) and its accompanying tour, current members of Hedley faced accusations of sexual misconduct with young women over the course of their career. After Hoggard faced additional accusations of sexual assault by two women, the group confirmed they would enter an indefinite .

==History==

===2003–2006: Early years and debut album ===
Hedley formed in 2003 in Abbotsford, British Columbia and originally consisted of Jacob Hoggard, Kevin Giesbrecht, Kevin Heeres, Ryan Federau, and Brandon McKay. Hoggard got into Canadian Idol, where he made it to the top three. Shortly after, the members decided to go their separate ways, but the band re-formed not long after, with Hoggard as the only original member. He recruited guitarist Dave Rosin, bassist Tommy Mac, and drummer Chris Crippin, all of whom previously teamed in the Vancouver band Everything After. The band picked up attention at the Canadian Music Week 2005 media showcase and, soon after, signed with Universal Music Canada. &quot;Street Fight&quot; was the first song they wrote together, which was part of their five-track demo they sent to the label.

Their debut single &quot;On My Own&quot; was released on July 18, 2005 as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The song reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. &quot;Villain&quot; was released as the second single from the album on July 26, 2005 and peaked at number 18 on the Canada Rock chart. &quot;Trip&quot; was released as the third single from the album on October 4, 2005. The song peaked at number 11 on the Canadian Singles Chart. Brian Howes produced the track and won the group a Juno Award for Producer of the Year in 2007. &quot;321&quot; was released as the fourth single on March 14, 2006 and reached number 21 on the Canada CHR/Top 30 chart. &quot;Gunnin&#x27;&quot; was released on September 12, 2006 as the album&#x27;s fifth single. Garth Richardson produced &quot;Gunnin&#x27;&quot; as well as &quot;Villain&quot; and earned both songs a Juno nomination for Producer of the Year in 2006. &quot;Street Fight&quot; was released in December 2006 as the sixth and final single from the album.

On September 6, 2005, the group released their debut album, &quot;Hedley&quot;. The album was produced by Howes and Richardson. They recorded the album in Armoury Studios, Greenhouse Studios, Hipposonic Studios and Mushroom Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia and in The Farm Studios in Gibson&#x27;s Landing, British Columbia. The album peaked at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart and was certified double platinum in Canada. At the 2006 Juno Awards, the group was nominated for Breakthrough Group of the Year and their self-titled album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year.

In 2005 the band went on their first tour across Canada, with The Weekend and Faber Drive. Then went on a 19-city Canadian tour with Simple Plan and in early 2006, headlining The Get Some Tour cross Canada club tour with MxPx and Faber. In the summer of 2006, they signed a record deal for the United States with Capitol Records. Upon signing Hedley&#x27;s self-titled album was released with a new cover in the US on September 26, 2006, a year after its initial release in Canada. During June 2006, the band went on tour in the US, opening for fellow Capitol Records artist, Yellowcard, with Matchbox Romance. Subsequently, Hedley was dropped by Capitol Records a year later. &quot;Hedley&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year and the band was nominated for Group of the Year at the 2007 Juno Awards. The group released a DVD in 2006 called &quot;Try This at Home&quot;. It was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year in 2007.

===2007–2010: &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go&quot; ===
The group began working on their second studio album in May 2007 with producers Dave Genn and Greig Nori. The group recorded the album in Hipposonic Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia and in Rock Beach Recording in White Rock, British Columbia. They released their second studio album, &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;, on October 30, 2007 and went platinum in Canada ten days after its release. The album peaked at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart. The first single from the album, &quot;She&#x27;s So Sorry&quot;, was released to radio on August 21, 2007, and had its music video premiere on MuchMusic on September 20, 2007. &quot;For the Nights I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot; was released in November 2007 as the album&#x27;s second single. The song peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100. The song also topped the Canada Hot AC charts for eight weeks. The song won three MuchMusic Video Awards in 2008. In late 2007, the band was chosen to open for Bon Jovi on their Lost Highway Tour at their Canadian stops for 14 shows which forced them to postpone their own tour until early 2008, opened by State of Shock. &quot;Never Too Late&quot; was released in April 2008 as the third single from the album. The song reached number four on the Canadian Hot 100. &quot;Old School&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in August 2008 and reached number ten on the Canadian Hot 100. &quot;Dying to Live Again&quot; was released in November 2008 as the fifth single from the album.

In the United States, the group released &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; as &quot;Never Too Late&quot; on May 12, 2009 by Fontana Distribution, at the time owned by Hedley&#x27;s Canadian record label&#x27;s parent company Universal Music. The album includes 8 tracks from the Canadian release and contains 5 tracks from their first album. &quot;Never Too Late&quot; was released as a single in the United States on May 19, 2009.

On August 17, 2009, the group released &quot;Cha-Ching&quot; which serves as the first single from their third album. The peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100. The second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot; peaked at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100. On November 17, 2009, Hedley released their third studio album &quot;The Show Must Go&quot;. The album peaked at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart and was certified double platinum in Canada. The album earned a Juno award nomination for Pop Album of the Year in 2010. The band was also nominated for Group of the Year. The third single &quot;Perfect&quot; peaked at number seven on the Canadian Hot 100. The song also reached number 25 on the US Adult Top 40 chart, marking the group&#x27;s first charting song in the US. The song was nominated for Single of the Year and won Video of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards. The fourth single off the album was &quot;Hands Up&quot; and reached number 27 on the Canadian Hot 100. &quot;Sweater Song&quot; was released as the fifth single and peaked at number 63 on the Canadian Hot 100. The band went on The Show Must Go... on the Road Tour across 38 cities in Canada in promotion of the album &quot;The Show Must Go&quot; with supporting acts from Fefe Dobson, Stereos, Faber Drive and Boys Like Girls. A live album and documentary &quot;Go with the Show&quot; was recorded during this tour and was released on November 9, 2010. &quot;The Show Must Go&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards.

In 2010, the band signed an American record deal with Island Records. The album was originally to be released in the US on October 12, but instead was released on December 7, 2010, containing the bonus tracks &quot;I Do (Wanna Love You)&quot; (a re-arrangement of the song &quot;For the Nights I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot; and &quot;Color Outside The Lines&quot;. The band also toured the US to promote the album. The band performed &quot;Cha-Ching&quot; in a segment with other artists highlighting Canadian music at the closing ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games.

===2011–2014: &quot;Storms&quot; and &quot;Wild Life&quot;===
On May 5, 2011, Hedley confirmed that they were back in the studio recording a new album. Around the time of recording, bassist Tommy Mac was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Mac managed to record his tracks for the album in between treatments and was later declared cancer-free. According to the group, Mac&#x27;s perseverance inspired the band to &quot;create the kind of uplifting songs that might spur others to carry on through their own hard times.&quot;

The first official single from the album &quot;Invincible&quot;, was released on August 23, 2011. The track sold 14,000 copies in its first week and peaked at number nine on the Canadian Hot 100.

The song earned a Juno Award nomination for Single of the Year in 2013. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year.

Hedley headlined the 101st Grey Cup Halftime show at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field in Regina, Saskatchewan on November 24, 2013, performing a 13-minute compilation of &quot;Hands Up&quot;, &quot;Anything&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Cha-Ching&quot;. Hedley went on a Canadian national headlining tour, Wild Live Tour, to promote the album from February to April 2014.

===2015–2018: &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Cageless&quot;===
On September 8, Hedley released &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; as the lead single off their sixth studio album. &quot;Hello&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on October 9, 2015. The song reached number 20 on the Canadian Hot 100. &quot;Hello&quot; was released via Universal Music Canada on November 6, 2015. The album topped the Canadian Albums Chart and sold 14,500 copies first week.

The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Lose Control&quot; was released on March 4, 2016. The song peaked at number 37 on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum in Canada. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; was released on August 25, 2016 and reached number 43 on the Canadian Hot 100. The group embarked on the Hello World Tour with supporting acts from Carly Rae Jepsen and Francesco Yates. On July 3, 2016, they were the headliners of the post-Queen&#x27;s Plate concert held at Woodbine Racetrack (in Toronto) which also featured The Strumbellas &amp; The Mathew Good Band. The album was certified platinum in Canada.

On March 31, 2017, Hedley announced on their Facebook page that their drummer, Chris Crippin had left the band after 11 years. Crippin later revealed that he had been fired by the group. He also spoke about his time with the band, saying that Hoggard was &quot;extremely rude&quot; and was silenced when he tried to confront Hoggard about his behaviour. On June 13, 2017, the group released the lead single, &quot;Love Again&quot; from their upcoming seventh studio. The song peaked at number 50 on the Canadian Hot 100. &quot;Better Days&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on August 18, 2017. The song reached number 42 on the Canadian Hot 100. Their seventh studio album &quot;Cageless&quot;, was released September 29, 2017. The album debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart and in its first week, sold 9,000 copies.

On February 13, 2018, then current Hedley members were anonymously accused of sexual misconduct with young fans, primarily female, as young as 14 years of age. As a result, the Juno Awards and the band mutually agreed to cancel their scheduled performance. The band posted a Facebook message, saying that the accusations were unsubstantiated and that while the band in the past &quot;engaged in a lifestyle that incorporated certain rock and roll clichés [...] there was always a line that we would never cross&quot;. On February 28, 2018, Hedley announced that they would take an indefinite hiatus following their tour, while Hoggard announced he would be taking an indefinite step back from his career. On February 16, 2018, it was announced that Hedley was dropped by their management team effective immediately. Several radio stations and media organizations (including Corus Radio and CBC Music) removed and suspended all of their music due to these allegations. On February 25, 2018, an Ottawa woman accused lead singer Jacob Hoggard of sexual assault after the pair met on Tinder and went to a hotel to have sex in November 2016. On July 23, 2018, Hoggard was charged with one count of Sexual Interference and two counts of Sexual Assault Causing Bodily Harm. On October 20, 2022, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting the Ottawa woman. On August 16, 2024, Hoggard began serving his five year prison sentence following an appeal dismissed by the court.

<text>Khoni () is a town in the Western Georgian region (mkhare) of Imereti with the population of 7,756 (as of January 2024). It is situated on the left bank of the Tskhenistsqali River in the north-west of Imereti, close to the border with the region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti and 266 km west of Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi. The town serves as an administrative centre of the Khoni District. Its economy is based on agriculture, particularly tea production.

Khoni has been known as a lively trading locale and a see of the Georgian Orthodox diocese since the Middle Ages. The town itself was founded in the 6th or 9th century and the still functioning St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in downtown Khoni was constructed between the 11th and 13th centuries. It acquired the status of a town in 1921. Under the Soviet Union, it was named after the Marxist revolutionary Alexander Tsulukidze in 1936, but the historical name of Khoni was restored in 1991.

<text>The Aabach (also: &quot;Große Aa&quot;) is a river in Germany, a left tributary of the river Afte. It rises near the village Madfeld, part of the town Brilon, in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia near the border with Hesse. From there it flows north between mountains up to high through a forested landscape, partly in the natural park Diemelsee. After a few kilometers it flows into the artificial lake Aabachstausee. It flows to the north and empties only about further north after Bad Wünnenberg, where it flows into the Afte.

The source of the Aabach is at the divide between the Weser and Rhine river basins: the Aabach flows to the north and drains into the Rhine via the Afte, Alme and Lippe, while the small rivers that rise on the southern side of the ridge drain into the Weser through the Hoppecke and Diemel.

<text>Peter Schilling (born Pierre Michael Schilling; 28 January 1956) is a German synthpop musician whose songs often feature science-fiction themes like aliens, astronauts and catastrophes. He is best-known for his 1983 hit single &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot; which was an international success.

== Life and career ==
Schilling was born in Stuttgart, Germany. His 1983 album, &quot;Error in the System&quot;, generated his only international hit single, 
&quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot;, a retelling of David Bowie&#x27;s classic 1969 song &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Although the song was originally recorded in German, the international hit version was sung in English. In 1984 and 1985, Schilling released the albums &quot;120 Grad&quot; and &quot;120 Grad&quot;&#x27;s English-language version, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Things to Come&quot;. From 1986 to 1989, Schilling released non-album singles and put out his 1988 compilation &quot;The Different Story&quot;. In 1990, Schilling suffered from burnout and the following year he took a break. In 1994, he married his girlfriend Catyana. They divorced in 2003. He has been married to his second wife since 2012.

In the late &#x27;90s, Schilling formed a side project called Space Pilots, which appeared on the first issue of the popular dance music compilation &quot;Dancemania&quot; series. The band included Catyana Schilling, J. Feifel, and P. Magnet. They have recorded only one song, titled &quot;Trip to Orion&quot;. It was released on vinyl and CD in 1995, and appears on the Japanese dance compilation CD &quot;Dancemania 1&quot;. The song is based on and includes vocal samples from the German science-fiction TV show &quot;Raumpatrouille Orion&quot;.

At the beginning of the 2000s he formed a new band and currently plays live concerts with his band, touring Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

Since 2018, Tessloff Verlag has published the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Der kleine Major Tom&quot; in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Bernd Flessner, as well as illustrations by Stefan Lohr. In the radio plays based on the books, Peter Schilling himself voices the great Major Tom. At the International Astronautical Congress 2018 in Bremen there was a world premiere of &quot;Major Tom&quot; by the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in a purpose-made classical arrangement by Oliver Groenewald. &quot;Major Tom&quot; can also be heard in the official DLR soundtrack and trailer for Mission Horizons. The songs &quot;Alles an Dir&quot; and the English-language counterpart &quot;All the things you are&quot; are the musical inspiration for official DLR videos for the Cosmic kiss space mission with the German ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer.

Since 2020, Schilling has experienced something of a revival due to the success of his older songs, both the originals and new live versions and his newest album ‘Vis Viva’ on his YouTube channel.

On March 24, 2024, a petition was initiated to make &quot;Major Tom&quot; the new anthem for the German national football team for the 2024 UEFA European Football Championship.

<doc id="1005771" wikidata="Q452388" url="?curid=1005771" title="Franz Strauss">
<text>Franz Josef Strauss (26 February 1822 – 31 May 1905) was a German musician and composer. He was principal horn player of the Bavarian Court Opera for more than 40 years, a teacher at the Royal School of Music, Munich, a conductor, and accomplished performer on the guitar, clarinet and viola

Strauss was the father of the composer Richard Strauss, on whose early musical development he was a great influence, steering his son to the classical and away from modern styles. As a composer, Strauss senior is remembered for his works for the horn. They include two concertos and numerous smaller works.

==Life and career==
Strauss was born in Parkstein, Bavaria. His father, Johann Urban Strauss, was of unsteady character; his children were illegitimate and he left their upbringing to their mother, Maria Anna Kunigunde Walter. She was a member of a large and musical family, and her brother (Johann) Georg Walter undertook the boy&#x27;s musical education. Georg taught Strauss to play the clarinet, guitar and a range of brass instruments. At the age of nine, Strauss was taken on as a pupil and player by another uncle, Franz Michael Walter, a military bandmaster. Georg&#x27;s son Benno Walter was later to become the first violin teacher of Franz&#x27;s son Richard and dedicatee of some of his works.

At the age of 15, through the influence of George Walter, Strauss was appointed to the private orchestra of Duke Max in Munich, where he remained for ten years. He gradually found that of all the instruments he could play, the horn suited him best. He started to compose for that instrument. Among his earliest compositions were a Romance, &quot;Les Adieux&quot;, and a Fantasy on Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Sehnsuchtswalzer&quot;, both for horn and orchestra with alternative versions for horn and piano.

In 1847, Strauss became a member of the orchestra of the Bavarian Court Opera. In May 1851 he married Elise Maria Seiff, with whom he had a son and a daughter. The son died aged 10 months in 1852, and in 1854, Strauss&#x27;s wife and daughter died of cholera. He lived a single life until 1863, when he married Josephine Pschorr (1837–1910), the daughter of a wealthy Munich brewer. They had two children: Richard Georg, born 1864, and Berta Johanna, born 1867.

Strauss&#x27;s first horn concerto was premiered, with the composer playing the horn part, in 1865 and he remained greatly in demand as a soloist. The conductor Hans von Bülow called him &quot;the Joachim of the horn&quot;. In 1871, he was appointed professor at the Royal School of Music; he was given the rank of Kammermusiker of the Bavarian court in 1873.
Strauss&#x27;s musical preferences were strongly classical; he loved the music of Mozart above all other, and also particularly admired Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert. He was not in sympathy with the new music of Wagner which his sovereign and employer, Ludwig II of Bavaria, assiduously promoted with productions at the Court Opera. Strauss&#x27;s antipathy to modern music influenced the early development of his son, Richard, who began as a composer in a traditional vein, not finding himself drawn to modernism until he had left paternal influence behind him during his time at Munich University.

Despite his personal distaste for Wagner, both as a man and a musician, Strauss&#x27;s strict professionalism drove him to devote all his technical mastery to the important horn solos in Wagner&#x27;s operas. He led the horn section in the premieres of &quot;Tristan und Isolde,&quot; &quot;Das Rheingold,&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre.&quot; Wagner said, &quot;Strauss is a detestable fellow but when he blows his horn one cannot sulk with him.&quot; At the conductor Hermann Levi&#x27;s invitation, Strauss played in the premiere of &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth in 1882. After a bad attack of influenza, Strauss was unable to play the horn for 18 months, but continued to play in the Court Opera orchestra as a violist, in which capacity he took part in the first performance in Munich of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

In 1875 Strauss was elected conductor of the amateur orchestra, the &quot;Wilde Gung&#x27;l&quot;, a post he held for 21 years. Among the players was his son, who learned the practicalities of orchestration there, and wrote some of his first compositions for the orchestra.

Strauss retired from the opera orchestra in 1889, though he continued his conducting and taught for some years thereafter. He died in Munich at the age of 83.

<text>Ballinasloe ( ; ) is a town in the easternmost part of County Galway in Connacht. Located at an ancient crossing point on the River Suck, evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of Bronze Age sites. Built around a 12th-century castle, which defended the fording point, the modern town of Ballinasloe was &quot;founded&quot; in the early 13th century. As of the 2016 census, it was one of the largest towns in County Galway, with a population of 6,662 people.

==History==
The town developed as a crossing point on the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon. The Irish placename – meaning the &quot;mouth of the ford of the crowds&quot; – reflects this purpose.

The patron saint of Ballinasloe is Saint Grellan, who tradition believes built the first church in the area. A local housing estate, a GAA club, the branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and formerly a school are named after him.

While there is evidence of more ancient settlement in the area (including crannog and ringfort sites in Garbally Demesne), Richard Mór de Burgh (c.1194–c.1242) is credited with founding the town in the early 13th century.

A castle was built in Ballinasloe on the east bank of the Suck in the 12th or early 13th centuries. This was later rebuilt or expanded by the O&#x27;Kellys of Hy-Many in the 14th century. The ruins of the outer wall of this structure remain visible today.

Ballinasloe is historically known for its limestone which was used in many public buildings in the town. The local Garda (police) station, built c.1840 as a terraced three-storey house, is built of cut limestone which indicates the relative prosperity of the town in the 19th century. A courthouse in the town, built c.1840, features roofs and walls built of limestone.

Much of Ballinasloe&#x27;s town centre was laid out in the 18th and early 19th centuries. During the Great Famine, a workhouse was opened in the town in 1842 at a cost of £9,500. The building&#x27;s chimney stacks, sills and walls were partially built of limestone. It was designed to house a maximum capacity of 1,000 people, but the 1851 census showed that the building housed 2,487 inmates. During the mid-1840s, a 64-bed fever hospital was built at the northeast of the workhouse with wards transformed to use as convalescent accommodation. Today, only the main block of the workhouse fever hospital survives.

During the 2009 floods in Ireland, the River Suck burst its banks and caused major flooding in Ballinasloe. About 40 families were evacuated by boat after the flooding caused over €8 million worth of damage in the town, with a number of buildings left under water for several weeks.
An archaeological survey, undertaken in September 2021 as part of a street enhancement programme in the town, revealed a number of human skeletons and 17-century artefacts, 12 centimetres below existing footpaths.

==Economy==
Fast-food restaurant Supermac&#x27;s opened its first restaurant in Ballinasloe in 1978. As of 2019, the restaurant chain had grown to 116 locations, including three stores in the town.

Ballinasloe traditionally had an agricultural economy, though the 1980s and 1990s saw a number of factories locate in the town. Local employers include Surmodics, a medical company with premises in the 39-acre Business &amp; Technology Park.

Another contributor to the local economy is the Enterprise Centre. Managed by the Ballinasloe Area Community Development (BACD), it is located on the outskirts of Ballinasloe along the Creagh Road. As of mid-2020, there were 26 enterprises based in the centre, with nine more regularly using the training, meeting and hot-desk facilities. In July 2021, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar visited the Enterprise Centre as part of a campaign to raise awareness of the advice available from the government about blended and remote work. In May 2024, the BACD celebrated its 25th anniversary and opened the town&#x27;s Enterprise Hub on Society Street, providing office space, workspaces and a meeting room.

The footwear and clothing company, Dubarry of Ireland, is headquartered in Creagh, Ballinasloe. In November 2004, Dubarry ceased its manufacturing facility in the town, however, its product development, marketing and distribution departments, remain in Ballinasloe.

Businesses in the town centre include Gullane&#x27;s Hotel, a three-star hotel and conference centre, which has served the area since 1943. The Shearwater Hotel, a four-star hotel, leisure centre and gym, is located at Marina Point.

During 2020, the future of the Aptar factory in Ballinasloe was questioned, and several TDs called for a taskforce on the issue. In August 2020, Aptar confirmed it would cease operations at the facility, with the loss of 115 jobs, stating that industrial equipment would be transferred to other Aptar global sites by the end of 2020.

In April 2020, an online community marketplace was launched which allowed shoppers to continue to buy locally and support the community, as shops closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Irish discount store chain, Mr. Price, opened a store in the town in 2022.

In June 2019, planning permission was granted for a five-screen Omniplex cinema to be built near the Tesco store in the town. Construction began in March 2022, with the single-storey cinema opening in May 2023.

Once a notorious traffic jam on the old Galway to Dublin road, Ballinasloe is now bypassed by the M6 motorway. The motorway was opened on 18 December 2009 as the N6 was upgraded.

The town can also be accessed by public bus, with CityLink serving the town on their Dublin to Galway route. Bus Éireann and Aircoach previously served the town, but announced in September 2020 and March 2024 respectively that it would end its Dublin to Galway services.

===Bicycle===
The Athlone to Galway Cycleway is a planned long-distance cycling and walking greenway that passes through Ballinasloe en route to Galway city. The route selection process was completed in December 2021, as part of the Dublin–Galway Greenway, following a long consultation process that began in 2014, with Ballinasloe being the first stop in the west.

===Rail===
The Ballinasloe railway station opened on 1 August 1851, and is served by the Dublin–Galway railway line.

===Water===
From 1828 to the 1960s, Ballinasloe was the terminus of the Grand Canal. Guinness Company used the town&#x27;s canal stores to store and distribute the Guinness to the midlands. The Grand Canal provided a route for Guinness barges to travel from Dublin to Shannon Harbour. The town features a public marina which was developed on the River Suck to allow traffic from the Shannon Navigation to access the town.

Ballinasloe hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year.

===October Fair===
The Ballinasloe Horse Fair is held annually in October. It is reputedly the oldest horse fair in Europe and dates back to the 18th century.

A large market typically takes place, along with a number of events, fireworks, a dog show and a fun fair beside Ballinasloe&#x27;s town theatre. The 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled as part of Ireland&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event returned in 2022, marking the 300th anniversary of the fair.

===Larry Reynolds&#x27; Weekend===
The Larry Reynolds&#x27; Weekend is a celebration of traditional Irish music. The event has run annually since 2014, in commemoration of Larry Reynolds, a former Ballinasloe native who emigrated to the United States in 1953 and brought the east Galway style of music to Boston. The festival sees a number of traditional music performances in the different bars around town. What would have been the seventh event, due to have taken place in September 2020, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Dinny Delaney Festival===
The Dinny Delaney Festival is an annual traditional music festival, celebrating the traditions of uilleann pipes, in commemoration of Dinny Delaney, a late Ballinasloe native and well-known piper of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The festival includes concerts, masterclasses, sessions and livestreams.

Between 1986 and 1988, a pirate radio station &quot;Kandy Radio&quot; was broadcast from Ballinasloe serving the town and its rural hinterland. A log from April 1988 recorded Kandy Radio on 103.5 FM and the station closed down that month. A temporarily-licensed station under the banner of &quot;Ballinasloe Community Radio&quot; on 102.8 MHz FM was also broadcast for five years running, which covered the Ballinasloe Horse Fair.

<text>Jobcentre Plus (; ) is a brand used by the Department for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom.

From 2002 to 2011, Jobcentre Plus was an executive agency which reported directly to the Minister of State for Employment. It was formed by the amalgamation of two agencies, the Employment Service, which operated Jobcentres, and the Benefits Agency, which ran social security offices.

== Role of Jobcentre Plus ==
Jobcentre Plus was an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions of the government of the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2011. The functions of Jobcentre Plus were subsequently provided directly through the Department for Work and Pensions. The agency provided services primarily to those attempting to find employment and to those requiring the issuing of a financial provision due to, in the first case, lack of employment, of an allowance to assist with the living costs and expenditure intrinsic to the effort to achieve employment, or in all other cases the provision of social-security benefit as the result of a person without an income from employment due to illness-incapacity including drug addiction. The organisation acted from within the government&#x27;s agenda for community and social welfare. Services were provided in the first instance via job advisers, both in-house and on the telephone. An information technology system known as the Labour Market System (LMS) contained the personal details of job seekers and advertised job vacancies for employers within each of the public offices.

Between 2012 and 2018 a government website named Universal Jobmatch was used whereby jobseekers could search for employment and employers could upload and manage their own vacancies whilst searching for prospective employees.

Claims may be made for the working-age benefit Universal Credit. Previously claims for Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Employment and Support Allowance and Income Support could be made.

== History ==

The forerunners of the Jobcentre Plus were the state-run labour exchanges, originally the vision of Winston Churchill, President of the Board of Trade, and William Beveridge, who had worked for a more efficient labour system in the early years of the twentieth century. This was intended to address the chaos of the labour market and the problems of casual employment.

In 1908, Beveridge was commissioned to devise a scheme which would combine labour exchanges with a new government-funded unemployment benefit. The Labour Exchanges Act 1909 was rushed through Parliament and was passed in September 1909 and, after months of planning and recruitment of clerks; 62 labour exchanges were opened on 1 February 1910. The number of offices rose to 430 within four years. At the suggestion of the Prime Minister David Lloyd George, from January 1917, the labour exchanges came under the new Ministry of Labour and were renamed employment exchanges, so as to more accurately reflect their purpose and function.

The National Insurance Act was passed in 1911 and the first payments were made at exchanges in January 1913. Initially this covered only elected trades, such as building, engineering and shipbuilding. Weekly contributions were paid by workers, employers and the state in the form of stamps which were affixed to an Unemployment Book (later called the National Insurance card). When no work was available, benefit was payable.

The basic rules and administration regarding claims and the disallowance of benefit remain unaltered today. From 1918, payments were also made to unemployed ex-soldiers and their dependants, as well as to civilians who found themselves unemployed due to the decline of war production industries. The out-of-work donation scheme (the original &quot;dole&quot;) was originally only a temporary measure.

As unemployment benefit was payable only for those with a contributions record, and even then for only twelve months for each claim, there remained a group on long-term low incomes, without access to benefit. That was relieved after the enactment of the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29), when payments began to be made to jobseekers on low incomes regardless of contributions.

Initially, benefits were paid weekly in cash, at the employment exchange. From 1973, the-then Department of Employment began to open a new network of &#x27;Jobcentres&#x27;, with orange signage (re-branded &#x27;Employment Service Jobcentre&#x27;, with dark blue signage, from 1994 to 2002) that advertised jobs but did not process benefits. During this time, claimants were required to make claims and &#x27;sign on&#x27; at separate unemployment benefit offices. With the introduction of the Employment Service in the mid-1990s, the unemployment benefit offices were integrated into Jobcentres. From the 1970s onwards, benefits were paid in the form of a girocheque, until the early-2000s, when payments would be made directly to the claimant&#x27;s bank account.

The first 56 Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder offices were brought into existence during October 2001.

As part of the &quot;Efficiency Savings Programme&quot; of 2004, changes were made to the structure and management of Jobcentre Plus as part of the governmental review headed by Sir Peter Gershon and Sir Michael Lyons to increase departmental efficiency amounting to £960,000,000; a target considered achievable in the period 2007-08. This initial plan was implemented within the Jobcentre structure as the &quot;Delivering our Vision Programme&quot;. Between 2005 and 2008, directors of the board were to be reduced in number from eight to six, the number of districts from seventy to fifty, the number of management and support staff employed were reduced by 5% and, amongst other things, the number of locations specifically employed to process claims would be reduced from 650 to 77.
In the 1990s, the Jobcentre reinforced a dress code which required male members of staff to wear ties. The code was later held to be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.

==Organisation==
According to figures obtained by the Work and Pensions Select Committee during 2005–2006, the number of employees within the organisation amounted to 71,000. The amount of money released by the Department for Work and Pensions to people in work-related benefit amounted to £100 million.

The 2000 Makinson Report, written by John Makinson, led to the introduction of a team-based incentive scheme, created in order to improve staff efficiency. The scheme takes as a measure of this efficiency for the allocation of bonuses for teams meeting specific targets (known as a performance-related pay-system) the relative successes in each team of the factors:
* of a rating by point-system based on criteria of the priority of each person to have been guided back into work (Job entry)
* the relative results of assessment of customer Service
* the specifics of whether the vacancy was filled at all, and if so, then the time taken for the advertised employment to be met (a measure of the satisfaction of the employer (Employer Outcome)
* the delivery of service professionally and with regards to the effectiveness (accuracy) of the entire organisation as a business targets (Business Delivery)
* a measure of the cost of levels of error by staff and customers, and of the reduction of fraud by customers.
, Jobcentre Plus had 750 offices and about 78,000 employees.

==Statistics==
According to the Work and Pensions Select Committee the organisation caused directly or indirectly 700,000 people to return to work between the months of April 2005 and January 2006.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, the total number of jobseekers in May 2012 was 1,590,708.

== Changes to the service ==
Between 2012 and 2018, jobsearch facilities were available to anyone via the Universal Jobmatch website. This became the UK&#x27;s most visited recruitment website with over a million visitors each week. Jobcentre Plus also offered services to employers and employment agencies, who can register their vacancies online through the online service or by calling Employer Direct. Vacancies are available immediately online.

Alongside these changes, Jobcentre Plus has also changed the way in which claims to benefits are processed. In the past, claimants contacted their local benefits office, were asked to manually complete the appropriate forms, and then booked an interview with an adviser in order to discuss work related issues (as appropriate) and submit the benefits claim for processing. The new system instead asks individuals to call a Jobcentre Plus call centre, where claim details are taken over the phone and entered directly to the computer system by the call agent. From summer 2012 new claimants with Internet access are strongly encouraged to make their claim online, and interview details were then sent to the claimant by text message. Customers are then asked to attend an interview at their local jobcentre to discuss work issues with an adviser, and finalise their claim, provide relevant signatures and proof of ID and address.

The processing of benefits claims has also changed, so that they are processed at a smaller number of larger Benefit Centres rather than local benefit offices and jobcentres.

During 2003, the DWP commenced the use of Post Office accounts for the payment of benefits, a process fully operational at the beginning of the financial year in 2005. The accounts are licensed and the electronic benefits transfer banking engine are provided by the company JP Morgan Europe. Prior to these services the banking facility were provided by Citibank. As of 2012, the payment system for benefits is being streamlined, and all payments will now be made into bank, building society or Post Office accounts, and the use of Girocheques was phased out by early 2013.

In 2012, the DWP announced a &quot;trailblazer&quot; scheme under which all new job seekers on Merseyside would be required to claim benefits online rather than in person at a Jobcentre Plus branch. This announcement was met with concern by Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger as well as chiefs at the Public and Commercial Services union and a member of Liverpool Council&#x27;s cabinet. This was a partial pilot scheme for one part of the new Universal Credit benefit, which is replacing the income-based Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance and Employment Support Allowance, plus Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Income Support and Housing Benefit. The changeover commenced in October 2013.

The Work Programme was introduced in 2011, and is mandatory for all jobseekers from nine months onwards. Unlike the previous New Deal scheme which offered the choices of: training, help in setting up a business, unpaid work placement in a field appropriate to the jobseeker, the work program requires that jobseekers must take unpaid work experience in a discount shop or similar big business retail. This has led to much controversy regarding the inflexibility and lack of choices in the scheme.

From 19 October 2012, all claimants applying for Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance were expected to look for work online, using the new Universal Jobmatch, an online system accessible from the government portal and powered by Monster.com, either at their local Jobcentre or from their home computer. Those jobseekers who do not possess the necessary computer skills will be offered IT training. Jobseekers are expected to use 30 hours of their own time per week searching for jobs, on top of the mandatory Work Programme, or take part in community service.

On 14 May 2018, the Universal Jobmatch was replaced by the Find a Job service, accessible via the government portal and powered by Adzuna. The Universal Jobmatch service closed down on 17 June 2018.

== Popular culture ==
The Jobcentre Plus service (and its forerunners the Social Security office, Unemployment Benefit office and Jobcentre/Labour Exchange) have featured in all forms of popular culture, often depicted in a general way to suggest poverty or unemployment. In the 1980s in particular, the Social Security office was frequently used as shorthand for the British recession.

Dramatic representations have included the sitcoms &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads&quot;, &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, &quot;Shelley&quot;, &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, &quot;Bread&quot;, &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;, the drama series &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; and the films &quot;Hot Enough for June&quot;, &quot;Made in Britain&quot;, &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot;.

In the black comedy series &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, a recurring character is Pauline Campbell-Jones (played by Steve Pemberton), the demented leader of a Restart course for a group of unemployed people.

The ITV sitcom &quot;The Job Lot&quot;, starring Russell Tovey and Sarah Hadland, was set in a busy West Midlands job centre. The series was produced by Big Talk Productions and written by Claire Downes, Stuart Lane and Ian Jarvis.

&quot;Love on the Dole&quot; is a novel by Walter Greenwood, about working class poverty in 1930s northern England. It has been made into both a play and film.

British reggae band UB40 are named after the paper form with the same name (Unemployment Benefit, form 40) that was used to apply for unemployment benefit.

== Winding-up of Jobcentre Plus ==
Jobcentre Plus as an executive agency ceased to exist as of 4 October 2011. Services offered by Jobcentre Plus are now offered directly by the Department for Work and Pensions. Although the Jobcentre Plus corporate brand remains in place at the present time, it functions only as a public brand of the Department, rather than a separate entity. In November 2024 plans were announced to merge the remaining 600 Jobcentre Plus locations with the National Careers Service to create a more centralised public service.

<doc id="1005797" wikidata="Q1493247" url="?curid=1005797" title="Gammel Dansk">
<text>Gammel Dansk is a bitters (herbal alcoholic preparation) produced by Arcus-Gruppen in Oslo, Norway, originally developed and produced by Danish Distillers in Denmark. Traditionally it is drunk by Danes at certain festive occasions, often in connection with breakfast meals, brunch or at wedding anniversaries and birthday celebrations (which in Denmark traditionally begin in the morning). The name &quot;Gammel Dansk&quot; translates directly from Danish as &quot;Old Danish&quot;.

==Description==
Gammel Dansk is a &quot;bitters&quot; liquor and was originally created to become a competitor on the Danish market to other bitters such as Underberg and Fernet Branca. It is matured with 29 types of herbs, spices and even flowers, making it similar to other &quot;stomach bitters&quot;, such as Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters or Jägermeister. These herbs and spices include rowan berry, angelica, star anise, nutmeg, anise, ginger, laurel, yellow gentian, Seville orange and cinnamon. The complete recipe is kept secret.

==History==
The development of Gammel Dansk commenced in 1964 and was led by master blender J.K. Asmund who also worked as factory manager for Danish Distillers in Roskilde. Three years later the production of the bitter started, and it has since become one of the most recognizable strong alcoholic beverages on the Danish market.

In the Denmark of the 1960s and 1970s, the drinking of bitters, such as Gammel Dansk, was not considered taboo in the morning. The bottle even reads &quot;Gør godt om morgenen, efter dagens dont, under jagten, på fisketuren eller som apéritif&quot;. (&quot;Will do you good in the morning, after a day&#x27;s work, when hunting or fishing, or as an apéritif.&quot;) With the 1980s came a greater concern for public health, and with that bitters fell out of favor compared to the lower ABV beer and wine. Even so, Gammel Dansk still constitutes two-thirds of all bitters sold in Denmark.

In 2007 Danish Distillers launched a new product which, as a tribute to J.K. Asmund, was labeled Asmund Special.

On 14 March 2014, Arcus, the owners of the Gammel Dansk brand, announced that production would move to Norway.

In 2014, Arcus launched &quot;Gammel Dansk Shot&quot;, a variation over the traditional recipe, flavored with liquorice and chili. It is intended to be drunk as a shooter.

In 2019 they launched a less bitter version called &quot;Gammel Dansk Halv bitter&quot;, meaning &quot;Half the bitterness&quot; aiming at younger customers. This version is advertised as being more sweet, less bitter and having a higher content of honey and licorice

<text>The Cameroon national football team (French: &quot;Équipe du Cameroun de football&quot;), also known as the Indomitable Lions (French: &quot;les lions indomptables&quot;), represents Cameroon in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the Fédération Camerounaise de Football, a member of FIFA and its African confederation CAF.

The team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup eight times, more than any other African team, and four times in a row between 1990 and 2002. However, the team has only made it out of the group stage once. They were the first African team to reach the quarter-final of the World Cup in 1990, losing to England in extra time. They have also won five Africa Cup of Nations.

Cameroon is the first and, as of 2022, only African country to defeat Brazil in tournament play, beating them in the 2003 Confederations Cup and 2022 FIFA World Cup by identical 1-0 scores.

==History==

===1956–2000: early years===
Cameroon played its first match against Belgian Congo in 1956, losing 3–2. They first qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations in 1970, but were knocked out in the first round. Two years later, as hosts, the Indomitable Lions finished third after being knocked out by their neighbours and future champions Congo in the 1972 Africa Cup of Nations. They would not qualify for the competition for another ten years.

Cameroon qualified for its first FIFA World Cup in 1982. With the increase from 16 teams to 24, Cameroon qualified along with Algeria to represent Africa at the tournament in Spain. Cameroon was drawn into Group 1 with Italy, Poland, and Peru. In their first game, Cameroon faced Peru and drew 0–0. They then held Poland goalless before a surprise 1–1 draw with eventual winners Italy. Despite being unbeaten, they failed to qualify for the second round, having scored fewer goals than Italy.

Two years later, Cameroon qualified for the 1984 Africa Cup of Nations, held in Ivory Coast. They finished second in their first-round group before beating Algeria on penalties in the semi-final. In the final, Cameroon beat Nigeria 3–1 with goals from René N&#x27;Djeya, Théophile Abega and Ernest Ebongué to become champions of Africa for the first time.

Cameroon qualified for the 1990 World Cup by surpassing Nigeria and beating Tunisia in the final round playoff. In the final tournament, Cameroon were drawn into Group B with Argentina, Romania and the Soviet Union. Cameroon defeated defending champions Argentina in the opening game 1–0 with a goal scored by François Omam-Biyik. Cameroon later defeated Romania 2–1 and lost to the Soviet Union 0–4, becoming the first side to top a World Cup Finals group with a negative goal difference. In the second round, Cameroon defeated Colombia 2–1 with the 38-year-old Roger Milla scoring two goals in extra-time.

In the quarter-finals, Cameroon faced England. After 25 minutes, England&#x27;s David Platt scored for England, while in the second-half, Cameroon came back with a 61st-minute penalty from Emmanuel Kundé and took the lead with Eugène Ekéké on 65 minutes. England, however, equalized in the 83rd minute with a penalty from Gary Lineker, while Lineker again found the net via a 105th-minute penalty to make the eventual scoreline 3–2 for England. The team was coached by Russian manager and former player Valeri Nepomniachi.

The 1994 World Cup in the United States saw the adjustment of representation for African teams qualifying, from two to three. Cameroon qualified along with Nigeria and Morocco. In the final tournament, Cameroon were drawn into Group B with Sweden, Brazil and Russia. After a 2–2 draw against Sweden, Cameroon lost to Brazil and Russia sealed their elimination. In their last game against Russia, the then 42-year-old Roger Milla became the oldest player to play and score in a World Cup finals match. The team was coached by French-born Henri Michel.
The 1998 World Cup in France saw the increase of 24 to 32 teams, with Cameroon one of the five countries representing Africa. Cameroon were drawn into Group B with Italy, Chile and Austria. Despite drawing with Chile and Austria (after leading 1–0 against them until the 90th minute), a 3–0 defeat to Italy saw Cameroon finish bottom of the group. Cameroon had three players sent off in the course of the tournament, more than any other team. They also had the highest card count per game of any team, collecting an average of four bookings in each match they played. It was also during this tournament that a certain Samuel Eto&#x27;o was exposed to Cameroonians. He was the youngest player of the tournament alongside Michael Owen of England. The team was coached by French-born Claude Le Roy.

===Post-2000===

Cameroon qualified for the 2002 World Cup in Korea-Japan, clinching first place in their group which included Angola, Zambia and Togo. Cameroon were drawn into Group E alongside Germany, the Republic of Ireland and Saudi Arabia. Cameroon started with a 1–1 draw with Ireland after giving up the lead and later defeated Saudi Arabia 1–0. In their last game, Cameroon were defeated 2–0 by Germany and were narrowly eliminated by the Irish, who had not lost a game.

Cameroon started the 2002 African Cup of Nations competition with a 1–0 win over DR Congo. That was followed by another 1–0 win against Ivory Coast, and a comfortable 3–0 win against Togo. These results led Cameroon to qualify from the group stage to the quarter-finals as their group&#x27;s winner. In the knockout stage, M&#x27;Boma&#x27;s goal in the 62nd minute lifted Cameroon over Egypt 1–0. Cameroon would defeat hosts Mali 3–0 in the semi-final on 7 February on route to repeating as champions by edging Senegal 3–2 on penalties following a scoreless 120 minutes on 13 February, and thereby qualifying for the 2003 Confederations Cup in France.

There, the Indomitable Lions became the first African country to defeat Brazil, courtesy of Samuel Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s tally in the 83rd minute of their opening match on 13 June. Cameroon subsequently defeated Turkey and drew the USA before dispatching Colombia in the semi-final. However, the latter was overshadowed by the sudden on-field collapse of Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foé in the 71st minute. Medics spent 45 minutes attempting to restart his heart, and although he was still alive upon arrival at the stadium&#x27;s medical centre, he died shortly afterwards. An autopsy determined the cause of death to have been hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an hereditary condition known to increase the risk of sudden death during physical exercise. The Final on June 29 against France, consequently, became not about the game but rather an occasion for both teams and fans to honor Foé. France prevailed 1-0 following Thierry Henry&#x27;s golden goal in the 7th minute of extra time, but abstained from traditional post-match celebrations. Instead, the tournament closed with one last tribute to Foé as Cameroon took a lap around the stadium holding a large photo of their fallen teammate.

In the 2006 World Cup qualifying round, Cameroon were drawn into Group 3 with the Ivory Coast, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Benin. Cameroon led the group until their final game, when Pierre Womé failed to convert a late penalty. On 8 October 2005, Cameroon drew with Egypt 1–1 while eventual World Cup debutants Ivory Coast defeated Sudan 3–1, preventing Cameroon from travelling to Germany.

In Cameroon&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, the team was grouped with Gabon, Togo and Morocco. After a slow start in their campaign with a loss to Togo, the coach of Cameroon, Otto Pfister, resigned. Frenchman Paul Le Guen was appointed as the new coach after a draw against Morocco. Le Guen&#x27;s appointment caused an uprise in Cameroon&#x27;s spirits as they earned a win against Gabon in Libreville, followed by another win against the Panthers four days later in Yaoundé. One month later, they defeated Togo in Yaoundé by three goals. On 14 November 2009, Cameroon defeated the Atlas Lions of Morocco 2–0 in Fez in their last match of their campaign. Gabon was also defeated by Togo 1–0 in Lomé. Both results caused Cameroon to qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals, held in South Africa.

The Indomitable Lions were the first team to be mathematically eliminated in the 2010 World Cup, going out in their second group match to Denmark after losing 1–2, preceded by a 0–1 defeat to Japan.
Cameroon started the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations competition with a 1–1 draw to Burkina Faso, followed by a 2–1 win against Guinea-Bissau, and an unconvincing goalless draw against the hosts Gabon. These results were enough for Cameroon to qualify from the group stage to the quarter-finals, where they met Senegal in a close match that Cameroon won 5–4 in a penalty shootout after it had ended goalless in extra time. In the semi-finals, Cameroon met Ghana and won the match 2–0 to qualify to the final.

On 5 February 2017, and after a close match, Cameroon won the African Cup of Nations for the fifth time after defeating seven-time champions Egypt 2–1 in the final, by Vincent Aboubakar&#x27;s late goal in the 89th minute of the match.
As champions, Cameroon qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia, where they were eliminated in the group stage.

Cameroon qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar via the away goals rule after defeating hosts Algeria 2–1 on 29 March 2022 thanks to Karl Toko Ekambi&#x27;s winner in the 124th minute of the second leg of their CAF third round home-and-away tie with The Fennec Foxes. On 2 December 2022, in the final match of Group G, The Indomitable Lions made history by becoming the first African country to defeat Brazil at the World Cup. Vincent Aboubakar netted the contest&#x27;s lone goal in the 2nd minute of stoppage time, and subsequently received his second booking and dismissal for removing his shirt during his celebration. It was the Seleção&#x27;s first group stage loss since a 2–1 defeat to Norway in 1998 and Cameroon&#x27;s first ever World Cup win since 2002. Cameroon failed to advance from their group, however, as they finished third behind Brazil and Switzerland, respectively.

After the dramatic qualification process for the previous World Cup, the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon had to wait until the last day to secure their ticket for the AfCoN 2023 (scheduled to be played in January 2024) in Ivory Coast. Despite a relatively favorable draw for the qualifiers, which included Namibia, Burundi, and Kenya (the latter eliminated due to administrative interference), the Cameroonian team faced significant challenges. They struggled against the modest Namibian team, managing a 1–1 draw in Yaoundé and then suffering a 2–1 loss in South Africa. After securing a 1–0 victory over Burundi in the first leg, they needed to confirm their qualification in the second leg to avoid missing out on the continent&#x27;s most prestigious competition, which would have meant watching it on television. In a packed Roumde Adja stadium on Tuesday, September 12, the Indomitable Lions secured their spot in the AfCoN 2024 thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo (46&#x27;), Christopher Wooh (59&#x27;), and Vincent Aboubakar (90+3&#x27;).

==Kits and crests==

The Cameroon national football team&#x27;s tradition color is green shirts, red shorts and yellow socks, colors of the national flag.

The Cameroon national football team had a long-term partnership with Puma.

===Controversy about sleeveless and one-piece kits===
Cameroon used sleeveless Puma shirts at the 2002 African Cup of Nations in Mali, which they won for the fourth time. FIFA, however, did not allow Cameroon to use the same kits as at the 2002 World Cup, and black sleeves were added to the shirts. The 2004 African Cup of Nations witnessed Cameroon again run into controversy regarding their kits. Puma had designed a one-piece kit for the Cameroon team which FIFA declared illegal, stating that the kits must have separate shirts and shorts. FIFA then imposed fines on Cameroon and deducted six points from their qualifying campaign. Puma argued that a two-piece kit is not stated as a requirement in the FIFA laws of the game. Puma, however, lost the case in court, and Cameroon were forced to wear two-piece kits, but FIFA subsequently restored the six qualifying points to Cameroon.

<text>Estádio Cidade de Coimbra is a stadium in Coimbra, Portugal. This stadium belongs to the Municipality of Coimbra and is mainly used by the Académica de Coimbra&#x27;s football team.

The stadium was rebuilt, expanded, and modernized to host some UEFA Euro 2004 matches. Far beyond the sports stadium itself, all the project, called Euro Stadium Project, included the possibility of organizing sports, culture, and commercial events, by the modernization of the entire Calhabé area in Coimbra.

On 29 October 2003, Académica de Coimbra played at home to Sport Lisboa e Benfica in the first official match in the remodelled stadium.

==Features==
Its design does not involve any historical or traditional references, as the idea was to create a new, contemporary image with glass façades and an aesthetic roof supported by elegant stands. The existing athletics track has been preserved for possible use as a multi-purpose facility in the future. The stadium was designed by the Portuguese architectural firm Plarq in association with KSS Design Group of London. The Plarq team was led by the architect António Monteiro.

The stadium has 29,622 seats, two-thirds of which are covered. The complex boasts a large press centre, a bar, kitchens, and a restaurant with a panoramic view of the pitch. The project of the stadium took advantage of old seats: of close to 15,000 (all seated), involved the planned remodelling of the tier which extends around the entire perimeter of the previous stands, and a second tier above that, in the form of a &quot;U&quot;, opening onto the slopes of the city at the North end.

A multi-purpose pavilion, olympic swimming pools, healthclub, gym, offices and studio apartment residences were built in the surrounding area. The Alma Shopping, a shopping and leisure center built near the stadium, includes cinemas, underground car parking, restaurants, and several retail outlets.

== Major events ==

===UEFA Euro 2004===
The stadium hosted two UEFA Euro 2004 Group B matches: England 3–0 Switzerland and Switzerland 1–3 France. Curiously in both matches, the record for the European Championship&#x27;s youngest goalscorer was broken, first by Wayne Rooney, then by Johan Vonlanthen.
===Portugal national football team===
The following national team matches were held in the stadium, both in its old and renovated shape.
=== Taça de Portugal final ===
The stadium also hosted the 2020 Taça de Portugal Final between both O Clássico rivals Benfica vs Porto also replacing Estádio Nacional that was supposed to be held but the original final match venue was unable to host the match due to security reasons and avoid the crowds of spectators to break the COVID-19 pandemic chain.
=== Taça da Liga final ===


===Concerts===
In addition to football, the stadium is often used for concerts of international artists with capacity up to 50,000 people.

The stadium was inaugurated with a Rolling Stones concert on 27 September 2003, attended by over 50,000 people.

George Michael played there in 2007 during the 25 Live, with 39,639 spectators.

In 2010, U2 played two sold-out shows in the stadium during their U2 360° Tour. Approximately 109,985 people attended the event.

On June 24, 2012, Madonna performed in front of 33,597 people as part of her MDNA Tour.

Coldplay performed at the stadium on 17, 18, 20, &amp; 21 May 2023 as part of their Music of the Spheres World Tour.

<text>Ahr () is a river in Germany, a left tributary of the Rhine. Its source is at an elevation of approximately above sea level in Blankenheim in the Eifel, in the cellar of a timber-frame house near the castle of Blankenheim. After it crosses from North Rhine-Westphalia into Rhineland-Palatinate.

The Ahr flows through Ahr valley or &quot;Ahrtal&quot;, passing through the towns of Schuld, Altenahr and Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Between Remagen and Sinzig (south of Bonn), at about above sea level, it flows into the Rhine. The length is roughly , of which is within Rhineland-Palatinate. The Ahr has a gradient of 0.4 percent in its lower course, and 0.4 to 0.8 percent in its upper course.

The Ahr and its tributaries are a main drainage system of the eastern Eifel. The watershed is approximately .

== History ==
There were isolated settlements in the Ahr valley beginning at the latest in Roman times, evidenced by the Roman villa near Ahrweiler. Owing to their isolated location, the upper and middle parts of the course were sparsely populated.

That began changing in the mid-19th century. The development of settlements and transportation routes (including three railway lines) and the expansion of the area used for agriculture in the Ahr valley led to the narrowing and constraint of the riverbed. The course of the river was graded and its banks were stabilized.

Catastrophic flash flooding occurred on the Ahr in 1910 and 2021 resulting in the deaths of hundreds.

== Course ==
The Ahr rises in the middle of the village of Blankenheim, in the Eifel region of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, in the basement of a timber-framed house in an enclosed spring at a height of . It then flows through the &quot;Schwanenweiher&quot; pond below Blankenheim Castle.
The stream, which runs in a south-easterly direction, through the valley meadows of upper Ahr valley, has not cut very deeply into the heights of the Eifel. Much of the upper Ahr valley is protected and follows the B 258 federal road. Below the hamlet of Ahrdorf in the municipality of Blankenheim, the Ahr reaches its southernmost point and enters the state of Rhineland-Palatine. From Müsch via Antweiler to Fuchshofen, the river runs northwards and turns east at Schuld heading through Insul to Dümpelfeld. Here, the Ahr collects the waters of the Adenauer Bach coming from the right and flowing in a northeasterly direction. In Altenahr, the valley bends to the east and initially follows a very winding course. Here the river is accompanied by the B 267, although it does not follow every loop in the river. In Altenahr, the largest bend in the river beings; it is protected because of its flora and fauna. From here, the valley becomes a gorge bordered by the steep cliffs of the Ahr Hills. From Reimerzhoven the valley sides are dominated by vineyards, especially on the south-facing slopes north of the river, particularly around the villages of Mayschoß, Rech, Dernau and Marienthal. The last narrow point in the Ahr valley occurs below the &quot;Bunte Kuh&quot; (&quot;coloured cow&quot;), a rock formation that almost reaches the river and leaves little room for road and railway. In Walporzheim, the valley widens abruptly, and the Ahr passes through the county town of Bad Neuenahr. In Heimersheim, the vineyards end. The valley floor between Bad Bodendorf on the northern side and Sinzig on a terrace in the south is dominated by agriculture and fruit and vegetable growing.

The mouth of the Ahr lies on the plain of the Golden Mile, between the Remagen district of Kripp and the town of Sinzig at a height of about . Since being re-naturalised (from 1979, see aerial photographs) it has been one of the few natural river mouths on the Rhine and is under protection.

== Tributaries ==

The tributaries of the Ahr include (in upstream order):
Tributaries with a length of over 7 km (from source to mouth):
Left tributaries are in dark blue; right tributaries in light blue.
== Viticulture ==

The Ahr is well known for the many vineyards that grace the hillsides downstream of the village of Altenahr. The small Ahr wine region is nevertheless the largest contiguous red wine-growing area in Germany, noted especially for wines made from the Spätburgunder (&quot;Pinot noir&quot;) grape. The Red Wine Trail runs through the southern slopes of the lower Ahr Valley, passing &quot;inter alia&quot; the former government bunker.

<doc id="1005804" wikidata="Q5095990" url="?curid=1005804" title="Chichester Cross">
<text>Chichester Cross is an elaborate Perpendicular market cross in the centre of the city of Chichester, West Sussex, standing at the intersection of the four principal streets. It is a Grade I listed building.

According to the inscription upon it, this cross was built by Edward Story, Bishop of Chichester from 1477 to 1503, but little is known for certain and the style and ornaments of the building suggest that it may date from the reign of Edward IV. It was built so that the poor people should have somewhere to sell their wares, and as a meeting point. An earlier wooden cross had been erected on the same site by Bishop William Reade (1369–1385). The stone cross was repaired during the reign of Charles II, and at the expense of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond in 1746, and stands to this day.

The Market Cross is constructed of Caen stone, one of the most favoured building materials of the age. The cross&#x27;s form is octangular, having a strong butment at each angle, surmounted with pinnacles. On each of its faces is an entrance through a pointed arch, ornamented with crockets and a finial. Above this, on four of its sides, is a tablet, to commemorate its reparation in the reign of Charles II. Above each tablet is a dial, exhibiting the hour to each of the three principal streets; the fourth being excluded from this advantage by standing at an angle. In the centre is a large circular column, the basement of which forms a seat: into this column is inserted a number of groinings, which, spreading from the centre, form the roof beautifully moulded. The central column appears to continue through the roof, and is supported without by eight flying buttresses, which rest on the several corners of the building. Malmesbury Market Cross in Wiltshire is the other surviving late medieval covered English market cross with a similar form, but rather smaller and simpler.

Until the start of the nineteenth century the Cross was used as a market-place; but the increased population of the city requiring a more extensive area for that purpose, a large and convenient market-house was, about the year 1807, erected in the North-street; on the completion of which, it was proposed to take down this Cross, then considered as a nuisance. This was prevented from taking place when some of the members of the corporation purchased several houses on the north side of the Cross in order to widen that part of the street by their demolition.

A bust of King Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur was added to the cross in the 1660s. The bust was removed in the 1970s after which it was replaced by a glass fibre replica. In 2019 it was loaned to The Novium museum.

<text>Ballynahinch or Ballinahinch () is a village in County Galway in the west of Ireland. It is situated close to Recess, on the road from Recess to Roundstone. It also lies on the route of the former railway line from Galway city to Clifden (the &quot;Capital of Connemara&quot;). The name comes from the Irish &quot;Baile na hInse&quot; meaning &quot;settlement of the island&quot;.

Ballynahinch Castle, built in 1684 for the Martyn family, is located there. In the early 1900s it was the summer residence of Ranjitsinhji, the Maharaja of Nawanagar, and former test cricketer with the English Cricket Team.

<doc id="1005810" wikidata="Q927610" url="?curid=1005810" title="AgustaWestland Apache">
<text>The AgustaWestland Apache is a licence-built version of the Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopter for the British Army Air Corps. The first eight helicopters were built by Boeing; the remaining 59 were assembled by Westland Helicopters (later AgustaWestland) at Yeovil, Somerset in England from Boeing-supplied kits. Changes from the AH-64D include Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, a new electronic defensive aids suite and a folding blade mechanism allowing the British version to operate from ships. The helicopter was initially designated WAH-64 by Westland Helicopters and was later given the designation Apache AH Mk 1 (also written as &quot;Apache AH1&quot;) by the Ministry of Defence.

The Apache was a valued form of close air support in the conflict in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea had proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which was a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches also served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships. 

The Apache AH1 was retired in 2024 and all models were remanufactured to the later AH-64E version.

==Development==
The requirement for a new attack helicopter was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the Eurocopter Tiger, a modernised Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, the AH-64 Apache, the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, and the Agusta A129 Mangusta. Both the Tiger, Commanche and upgraded Cobra variant required more development, and thus risk, while the Apache was combat proven, though its performance in the First Gulf War was criticised by competitors. Westland and the Apache was selected in July 1995, and a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.

In September 1998, Westland produced the first prototype WAH-64 Apache under licence from Boeing. The first nine Apache AH1s were authorised for service by the director of British Army Aviation on 16 January 2001. The 67th and final Apache was handed over to the British Army in July 2004. The helicopter fleet&#x27;s cost was around £3.1 billion, with a total acquisition cost of £4.1 billion.

Reliability had been questioned by US Apache operations, the entire fleet in the Balkans had been grounded due to serious tail rotor failures in 1999. In 1998, the AN/APG-78 Longbow radar&#x27;s development ran into problems regarding its weight, impact upon overall agility, and data transfer abilities. These problems with key aircraft components, and fleet&#x27;s high cost, led to calls for its cancellation in 1999.

When the requirement for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain&#x27;s main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK&#x27;s Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier , the aircraft carriers (all since retired) and their successors, the aircraft carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels and . Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.

The Westland Apache experienced delays in entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including a lack of the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.

In 2005, an out-of-service date for the Apache was forecast at 2030. Various options were considered for maintaining the capability:
*A capability sustainment programme (CSP) to extend the existing fleet&#x27;s life to 2040. 
*Buying new Block III helicopters 
*Remanufacturing to AH-64E standard, i.e. putting the existing engines and avionics into new airframes.

In August 2015, the UK requested the upgrade of 50 of its Apaches to AH-64E standard through a US Foreign Military Sale. The order was confirmed in 2016, with the contract for remanufacturing of the first 38 awarded in 2017 and the remaining 12 in 2019. Leonardo Helicopters continued to lead the support to the Apache AH1s until they were retired from service in 2024. The Apache AH1 was remanufactured by Boeing to become AH-64E Version 6 aircraft with US engines.

The Australian Army purchased two retired AgustaWestland Apaches in 2024. The helicopters will be used as non-flying training aids ahead of the delivery of AH-64E Apaches to the Army. Both helicopters were transported from the UK to the US in March 2024 to be modified to ground training airframes.

==Design==

Several deviations were made to the standard Apache design used by the US and those exported to other countries. One major difference is the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 01/12 engines, replacing the original General Electric T700-GE-701C engines. The Rolls-Royce engine produces vs. for the GE T700C engine. Compared to many helicopters used by coalition forces in Afghanistan, the Apache required less modification to serve in the region due to special filters incorporated into the engine design. Another change is the folding blade mechanism to stow the helicopters in confined spaces; the rotor blades also have anti-ice protection to allow operations in Arctic environments.

There were changes made to the sensor and avionics outfitting the craft as well; connectivity with the BOWMAN secure communications system to interact with other British military units being a significant one. The Leonardo (formerly Selex ES) Helicopter Integrated Defensive Aids System (HIDAS) was also fitted. The HIDAS system was retrofitted onto the aircraft in mid-2004 just prior to entering service, along with several redesigned composite bodywork components. 

Instead of the American Hydra 70 rocket pods, the Westland Apache can carry up to 76 CRV7 rockets. The CRV7 uses a modular warhead: &quot;a high explosive, semi-armour piercing warhead for attacks on unarmoured targets and a kinetic energy penetrator, which contains no explosive, for attacks on armoured targets&quot;. There used to be a third type of warhead: the Multi-Purpose Sub Munition (MPSM), which was a controversial weapon as it has been classified as a cluster bomb; each rocket contained nine M73 submunitions. In May 2008, several senior officers, such as General David Ramsbotham spoke out against British plans to keep the weapon. In the same month, Britain, as one of the 111 participating nations, agreed to ban cluster bombs on humanitarian grounds. Britain destroyed the last of its CRV7 MPSMs in July 2009.
Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 carried an AN/APG-78 Longbow fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), providing an integrated surveillance and attack system. The &#x27;Longbow&#x27; radar was the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allowed the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, with only the radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar could monitor traffic in the Apache&#x27;s airspace. The radar could also be used for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem was interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allowed other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.
AgustaWestland made several upgrades to Britain&#x27;s Apache fleet. In May 2005, a $212 million contract was awarded to equip all the Mk1 helicopters with the Apache Arrowhead sensor system upgrade, to be completed by 2010. In 2009, it was announced that AgustaWestland was also integrating new external fuel tanks with ballistic protection. The magazine could be replaced with an Integrated Ammunition and Fuel unit, which reduced the ammunition capacity but increased loitering time. It had been suggested that advanced rotor blades and additional controls to improve the agility of the aircraft may have been fitted in a mid-life update of the fleet. 
==Operational history==

===Overview===
In May 2005, the first Apache-equipped regiment achieved operational status. The Westland Apache replaced the Westland Lynx AH7 as the British Army&#x27;s tactical attack helicopter. The Apache was operated by two regiments of the Army Air Corps (3 Regt AAC and 4 Regt AAC) as part of 1st Aviation Brigade. The Apache was intended to operate in the armed reconnaissance and attack roles, similar to the US usage of Apaches during the 1991 Gulf War. Unlike US versions, the Westland Apache had been partially navalised and for a time served aboard Royal Navy ships in addition to its land-based role. It achieved maritime certification in December 2005 aboard HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;. On 17 November 2006, HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; became the first aircraft carrier to land an Apache AH1.

They first appeared in combat as part of Operation Herrick in Afghanistan in May 2006. In August 2006, the intense usage of Apaches in Afghanistan led to British commanders admitting that weapons and spare parts were being used at a far greater rate, and subsequently a greater cost, than anticipated. On 11 November 2007, it was reported that half of the Apache gunships in British service had been grounded as they had fallen below the level considered &quot;fit for purpose&quot;, along with several other British Helicopters such as the Chinook and Merlin HC3. By November 2008, the situation had further declined, out of 67 aircraft only 20 were available for combat operations. In 2009, AgustaWestland was awarded a contract for support services for the Apache and many components such as the Longbow radar; in the following months senior officers noted that the support change had resulted in higher availability. In June 2011, civilian maintainers of the Apache at Wattisham Airfield threatened industrial action over a pay dispute.

In October 2008 it was announced that Prince Harry had begun the process of qualifying to become an Apache pilot. In May 2010, the terrorist organisation Al Qaeda threatened to abduct the prince if he piloted an Apache in Afghanistan. In April 2011, Prince Harry was promoted to captain following his completion of Apache conversion training. In June 2011, sections of the media reported that Prince Harry was to deploy to Afghanistan as an Apache pilot in 2012. He subsequently deployed to Afghanistan as part of 662 Squadron in September 2012.

Three Apaches were deployed to Bardufoss Air Station in Norway in January 2019. The deployment, known as &quot;Exercise Clockwork&quot;, represented the aircraft&#x27;s first cold weather training within the Arctic Circle.

===Afghanistan===
The Apache&#x27;s first operational tour was as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight Apache AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their American counterparts in Afghanistan, the Apache AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 hours at a time due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each Apache would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK Apache operating in Afghanistan&#x27;s Helmand province used a Hellfire missile to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect sensitive equipment.

The Apache quickly became a highly valued tool against insurgents, able to rapidly respond to Taliban forces on the ground. Major Huw Williams, second in command of 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, stated that: &quot;We&#x27;re really impressed [with the Apache]. It&#x27;s a very effective beast.&quot; It has been noted that Taliban forces refer to the aircraft as the &quot;Mosquito&quot;.

On 13 January 2007, a 200-strong British force, led by Royal Marines, launched an operation to attack Jugroom Fort, a major Taliban base in southern Helmand Province. After several hours of intense fighting, the Marines regrouped and it was discovered that Lance Corporal Mathew Ford of 45 Commando Royal Marines was missing. A rescue mission was launched using four volunteers, Royal Marines and a Royal Engineer, strapped to the stub-wings of two Apaches. The helicopters could not travel above 50 mph to ensure the safety of the extra passengers from rotor downwash. The Apaches landed under fire inside the compound, after which the rescuers dismounted and recovered the body of LCpl Ford. Ford&#x27;s body was flown out in the same manner that the soldiers arrived. Another Apache hovered above, providing suppressive fire throughout. None of the rescuers were injured in the recovery mission and they were later hailed for their bravery.
In May and June 2008, British and Afghan National Army forces conducted Operation Eagle&#x27;s Eye, aimed at disrupting Taliban activities to the south of Musa Qaleh; a key portion of which was a major night-time helicopter raid, rapidly deploying members of 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment into the town. In June 2008, a British Apache fired a thermobaric Hellfire missile; the controversial usage of such weapons was approved after extensive legal and ethical evaluations within the MoD. In June 2008, a Taliban leader and several cell members were killed in Helmand Province by a Hellfire missile launched by an Apache of the 664 Army Air Corps. There was a friendly fire incident in July 2008, in which an Apache fired upon a position thought to be held by enemy forces, but instead hit members of a British patrol; this was the first time that a British aircraft had been involved in a blue-on-blue incident in Afghanistan. In September 2008, an Apache was seriously damaged by a crash shortly after takeoff in Helmand province; no loss of life occurred but the airframe was written off.

In early to mid-2009, several narcotics and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches. During the summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in a precision strike launched by an Apache.

On 25 July 2011, the MoD announced that during a combat operation in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand province, several Afghan children had been injured from crossfire by an Apache; they were flown to Camp Bastion for medical treatment.

From 2006 to April 2014, British Apache helicopters flew 50,000 hours in Afghanistan, representing one-third of all UK Apache flying. The UK ended combat operations in Afghanistan in October 2014.

===Naval operations and Libya===


In May 2011, the MoD announced that the Apache fleet had reached 100,000 hours flying time, and describing it as a &quot;vital battlefield tool in Afghanistan&quot;. The Apache was also recognised as having established a &quot;limited maritime strike capability&quot; and were deploying on vessels such as HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;. On 17 May 2011, the Apache tested its Hellfire missiles against sea targets for the first time, 9 missiles were fired with a 100% success rate. 

On 27 May 2011, military officials announced that Apaches would be deployed as part of Operation Ellamy, the ongoing military intervention in Libya. The helicopters operated from the flight deck of HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; in conjunction with French Eurocopter Tiger helicopters over Misrata. The Apaches were also to assist in Operation Unified Protector, the enforcement of an embargo and no-fly zone upon Libya. On 14 June 2011, reports of British preparation to evacuate Yemen emerged, involving Apache and Merlin helicopters operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels off the coast.

On 4 June 2011, Apaches struck targets within Libya for the first time, destroying a radar site and an armed checkpoint near the town of Brega. Further precision strikes were launched by Apaches, typical targets were mobile air defenses, and were occasionally engaged by AK-47 fire from ground troops. In early June, Apaches conducted attacks on Gaddafi loyalists assaulting the town of Misrata. On 13 June, British Apaches destroyed several inflatable boats with 30 mm cannon fire, believed to be Libyan Special Forces, before engaging and destroying multiple vehicles along the coastline, including an anti-aircraft system. On 25 June, in coordination with RAF Tornado strikes, Apaches attacked loyalist infantry and vehicles around Brega and its airfield. On 1 July, British Apaches were reportedly involved in a &#x27;fierce&#x27; battle at the town of Khoms. On 2 July, Apaches destroyed several tanks and a bunker at a military camp near Zawiya. On 5 August, Apaches participated in the rebel push for the town of Zliten was reported.

By 21 June 2011, the Libyan government had dubiously claimed to have successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on the first month of Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway Fowler Class 7F was a class of steam locomotives. They were a Midlandised version of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class G2 and Class G2A s. They were also classified as Class G3 under the former LNWR system. The class were sometimes known as &quot;Baby Austins&quot;, or &quot;Austin 7s&quot;, after a motor car that was becoming popular at the time.

==Overview==
It featured a Belpaire firebox and increased boiler pressure over its predecessor but had the same power rating of 7F. Because the design had been done at the old Midland Railway&#x27;s Derby Works, the drawing office staff insisted on using Midland practice. Among other things this meant that the axle bearings were too small for the loads they had to carry. E.S. Cox, writing in a series of articles in Trains Illustrated c. 1957, suggests that they had a sufficiently modern and effective front end that, for steady slogging, some drivers preferred them to an LMS Stanier Class 8F. However, this also meant that, with bearings comparable to an LMS Fowler Class 4F and already inadequate for the lower powered engine, the bearings broke up rapidly.

==Numbering==
==Equipment==
Numbers 9672–74 were fitted with ACFI feedwater heaters when built but these were removed during the Second World War. After the war, five were briefly converted to oil burning.

==British Railways==
All members of the class entered British Railways ownership in 1948, but 122 had been withdrawn by the end of 1951; fifty were withdrawn without receiving their BR number. They had a fairly short life, and all were withdrawn and scrapped between 1949 and 1962, some time before the final G2s were withdrawn in 1964.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 13 March 1935, a milk train hauled by LMS Compound 4-4-0 No. 1165 had a rear-end collision with an express freight train hauled by LNWR Claughton Class 4-6-0 No. 5946 at King&#x27;s Langley, Hertfordshire due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Another freight train, hauled by LMS Patriot Class 4-6-0 No. 5511, collided with the wreckage. Locomotive No. 9598 was hauling a coal train that ran into the wreckage. One person was killed.
*On 14 May 1948, a locomotive of the class was hauling a freight train that ran away and was in collision with an empty stock train at Battyeford, Yorkshire.

== Withdrawal ==
All engines were withdrawn between 1949 and 1962.

<text>Interstate 430 (I-430) is a Interstate highway in Pulaski County, Arkansas, that bypasses the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock. I-430 begins at an interchange southwest of Downtown Little Rock with I-30 and travels north to cross the Arkansas River and end at I-40. The first plans for the freeway appeared in 1955.

==Route description==

I-430 starts its route at a trumpet interchange with I-30/US 67/US 70. From the interchange, US 70 joins I-430 as it travels northwest and passes over Highway 338 (Baseline Road) before having a diamond interchange with Highway 5 (Stagecoach Road). At the interchange, US 70 splits off onto Stagecoach Road to the east, with Highway 5 running west. I-430 goes north to pass Remington College and intersect Highway 300 (Colonel Glenn Road) before curving eastward to intersect Shackleford Road and then turning back north. Immediately after passing under Kanis Road, the highway has a cloverleaf interchange with I-630 at its western terminus. After I-630, the roadway goes past Immanuel Baptist Church and Breckenridge Village to intersect Rodney Parham Road near the Colony West Shopping Center and later Highway 10 (Cantrell Road). The Highway 10 interchange is the final I-430 interchange before the freeway crosses the Arkansas River on the I-430 Bridge. After the bridge, the roadway passes Rosenbaum Lake and intersects with Highway 100 (Crystal Hill Road) before ending at a three-way interchange with I-40/US 65.

==History==
Early plans for the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same alignment as the present I-30 through the Little Rock area but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. Later, in 1955, a map of the Interstate Highway&#x27;s plans shows a complete beltway around Little Rock, including present-day I-430 and I-440. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, the beltway was shortened to the current route of I-430.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) rerouted US 70 onto a portion of I-430 in May 2021 as part of a US 70 rerouting across Little Rock.

<doc id="1005823" wikidata="Q38499" url="?curid=1005823" title="Companion dog">
<text>A companion dog is a dog which is not primarily a working dog but a pet. The primary function of a companion dog is not to perform a useful job but to provide companionship to humans. A companion dog can also be called an emotional support animal and is used to help people with mental health disabilities cope with symptoms. Most dogs can be companions, including many working dog breeds such as retrievers, who are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a pet. Most toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.

==Description==

Breed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a &quot;working&quot; dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.

Dogs that have been chosen for traits that make a convenient pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years to Chinese nobility. The Pekingese and the Pug are both examples of canines chosen for their ability to be pets. In the case of the Pekingese, it was for their lion-like demeanor; for the Pugs, it was for their &quot;lucky&quot; wrinkles and their monkey-like face.

Other dogs that appear to be strictly a decorative or entertaining breed of dog originally also had jobs outside of their main companionship task, such as the Lhasa Apso&#x27;s job as a watch dog, or the delicate Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s exceptional rat-catching abilities.

==Competition Obedience Titles==
Companion Dog (&quot;CD&quot; added to the dog&#x27;s registered name) is officially a &quot;Novice obedience Title&quot; in the AKC Competition Obedience Ring, whereby a team enters the &quot;ring&quot; with 200 points, and needs to leave with at least 170 points to &quot;qualify&quot;. It requires three &quot;legs&quot; (trials) under three different AKC judges. Any dog can earn a CD title. Levels for obedience are Companion Dog (CD), Companion Dog Excellent (CDX), Utility Dog (UD), Utility Dog Excellent (UDX), Obedience Trial Champion (OTCH), and National Obedience Champion (NOC). A pet dog is not considered a &quot;Companion Dog&quot; without entering a competition ring and creating a document trail. The first AKC licensed obedience trial was held in 1936, where 200 dogs were entered.

==Companion versus toy dogs==
Toy dogs and companion dogs have a large overlap. However, companion dogs are not limited by size whereas all toy dogs are small.

<text>Duct Tape Forever is a 2002 Canadian comedy film based on &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. It was written by Steve Smith, the actor who plays Red Green.

==Plot==
When property developer Robert Stiles&#x27; limousine gets stuck in a sink hole on Possum Lodge&#x27;s property and several attempts to recover it send it into the lake, Stiles takes the matter to court. The town council and the presiding judge, who have been looking for decades for a way to shut down the Lodge, fine the lodge $10,000 and give them thirty days to pay, after which, if they are not successful, the Lodge ownership will revert to the town. Red&#x27;s nephew Harold Green (Patrick McKenna) pleads with the judge for a change to the time limit and she agrees - she makes it ten days instead.

The Lodge members try to brainstorm a way out of the mess, but once again Harold is the only one with a viable idea - 3M is running a duct tape sculpture contest in Minnesota, with a third prize of $10,000 (which the members feel they have a shot at). The members beg, borrow and steal enough duct tape to construct a goose, and Red, Harold and Dalton Humphrey (Bob Bainborough) set off for the long ride to the contest.

However, sinister forces are at work. Stiles has convinced the town&#x27;s sheriff (Darren Frost) to stop the trio by any means necessary. The sheriff is accompanied by Dawn (Melissa DiMarco), his beautiful deputy, who against all logic is smitten with Harold, although Harold is currently smitten with Dalton&#x27;s indifferent daughter.

The sheriff attempts a number of dirty tricks in order to waylay Red. At one point he and Dawn flatten the Possum Van&#x27;s tires, only to find out that Dalton has siphoned all the gas out of their police car, and that the nearest working gas pump is 20 miles away. At another point, the sheriff digs a hole in the road with a backhoe, but finds the police car on the opposite side from the van. In attempting to use the backhoe to move the police car to the other side of the hole, the sheriff instead drops the car into the hole, and the Possum Van drives right over it.

Eventually, Stiles takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Harold. Red sends Dalton back to the lodge for reinforcements, as he plans to get away with both Harold and the goose. While Harold is suffering the company of Stiles, Stiles reveals that his father was a lazy Possum Lodge member, and that his mother&#x27;s frustration over this fact drove him to succeed at any cost. He plans on buying Possum Lodge to convert it into a women&#x27;s club called &quot;Possum Landing.&quot;

At noon the next day, Red and Stiles meet with Red backed by his lodge members, and Stiles backed by his gang of workers. Just as the exchange is made, Red makes a getaway with Harold and the goose as the lodge members steal the cars of the workers.

Just as Red feels he has made his getaway, he finds that Stiles is chasing him with the only vehicle left from the site of the exchange – the bus that brought the lodge members to the showdown. Nevertheless, Red and Harold manage to make it to the contest just before they award third prize, winning it when the goose (pulled behind the Possum Van on a small trailer) detaches and flies over the contest to land majestically with all of the other entries.

After the contest the members of the lodge gather in the meeting room to celebrate with a large cake. Harold has invited Stiles to the meeting, who takes it as an attempt to humiliate him, before realizing Harold has invited his elderly mother as well and the two reconcile. While the candles on the cake are lit, Dawn entices Harold outside where they share a passionate kiss before the candles (which are revealed to be dynamite) explode. The film ends with a dazed Harold rejoining the group as Red asks for the duct tape to repair the damage.

<text>Khushwant Singh  (born Khushal Singh, 2 February 1915 – 20 March 2014) was an Indian author, lawyer, diplomat, journalist and politician. His experience in the 1947 Partition of India inspired him to write &quot;Train to Pakistan&quot; in 1956 (made into film in 1998), which became his most well-known novel.

Born in Punjab, Khushwant Singh was educated in Modern School, New Delhi, St. Stephen&#x27;s College, and graduated from Government College, Lahore. He studied at King&#x27;s College London and was awarded an LL.B. from University of London. He was called to the bar at the London Inner Temple. After working as a lawyer in Lahore High Court for eight years, he joined the Indian Foreign Service upon the Independence of India from British Empire in 1947. He was appointed journalist in the All India Radio in 1951, and then moved to the Department of Mass Communications of UNESCO at Paris in 1956. These last two careers encouraged him to pursue a literary career. As a writer, he was best known for his trenchant secularism, humour, sarcasm and an abiding love of poetry. His comparisons of social and behavioural characteristics of Westerners and Indians are laced with acid wit. He served as the editor of several literary and news magazines, as well as two newspapers, through the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1980 and 1986 he served as Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.

Khushwant Singh was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1974; however, he returned the award in 1984 in protest against Operation Blue Star in which the Indian Army raided Amritsar. In 2007, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award in India.

==Early life==
Khushwant Singh was born in Hadali, Khushab District, Punjab (which now lies in Pakistan), in a Sikh family. He was the younger son of Sir Sobha Singh, who later witnessed against Bhagat Singh, and Veeran Bai. Births and deaths were not recorded in his time, and for him his father simply made up 2 February 1915 for his school enrollment at Modern School, New Delhi. But his grandmother Lakshmi Devi asserted that he was born in August, so he later set the date for himself as 15 August. Sobha Singh was a prominent builder in Lutyens&#x27; Delhi. His uncle Sardar Ujjal Singh (1895–1983) was previously Governor of Punjab and Tamil Nadu.

His birth name, given by his grandmother, was Khushal Singh (meaning &quot;Prosperous Lion&quot;). He was called by a pet name &quot;Shalee&quot;. At school his name earned him ridicule as other boys would mock him with an expression, &quot;Shalee Shoolee, Bagh dee Moolee&quot; (meaning, &quot;This shalee or shoolee is the radish of some garden.&quot;) He chose Khushwant so that it rhymes with his elder brother&#x27;s name Bhagwant. He declared that his new name was &quot;self-manufactured and meaningless&quot;. However, he later discovered that there was a Hindu physician with the same name, and the number subsequently increased.

He entered the Delhi Modern School in 1920 and studied there till 1930. There he met his future wife, Kanwal Malik, one year his junior. He studied Intermediate of Arts at St. Stephen&#x27;s College in Delhi during 1930-1932. He pursued higher education at Government College, Lahore, in 1932, and got his BA in 1934 by a &quot;third-class degree&quot;. Then he went to King&#x27;s College London to study law, and was awarded an LL.B. from University of London in 1938. He was subsequently called to the bar at the London Inner Temple.

==Career==
Khushwant Singh started his professional career as a practising lawyer in 1939 at Lahore in the Chamber of Manzur Qadir and Ijaz Husain Batalvi. He worked at Lahore Court for eight years where he worked with some of his best friends and fans including Akhtar Aly Kureshy, Advocate, and Raja Muhammad Arif, Advocate. In 1947, he entered the Indian Foreign Service for the newly independent India. He started as Information Officer of the Government of India in Toronto, Canada, and moved on to be the Press Attaché and Public Officer for the Indian High Commission for four years in London and Ottawa. In 1951, he joined the All India Radio as a journalist. Between 1954 and 1956 he worked in Department of Mass Communication of the UNESCO at Paris. From 1956 he turned to editorial services. He founded and edited &quot;Yojana&quot;, an Indian government journal in 1951–1953; &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;, a newsweekly;&quot;The National Herald&quot;. He was also appointed as editor of Hindustan Times on Indira Gandhi&#x27;s personal recommendation.

During his tenure, &quot;The Illustrated Weekly&quot; became India&#x27;s pre-eminent newsweekly, with its circulation raising from 65,000 to 400,000. After working for nine years in the weekly, on 25 July 1978, a week before he was to retire, the management asked Singh to leave &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. A new editor was installed the same day. After Singh&#x27;s departure, the weekly suffered a huge drop in readership. In 2016 Khushwant Singh enters Limca Book of Records as a tribute.

== Politics ==
From 1980 to 1986, Singh was a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1974 for service to his country. In 1984, he returned the award in protest against the siege of the Golden Temple by the Indian Army. In 2007, the Indian government awarded Khushwant Singh the Padma Vibhushan.

As a public figure, Khushwant Singh was accused of favouring the ruling Congress party, especially during the reign of Indira Gandhi. When Indira Gandhi announced nation-wide-emergency, he openly supported it and was derisively called an &#x27;establishment liberal&#x27;.

Singh&#x27;s faith in the Indian political system was shaken by the anti-Sikh riots that followed Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, in which major Congress politicians are alleged to be involved; but he remained resolutely positive on the promise of Indian democracy and worked via Citizen&#x27;s Justice Committee floated by H. S. Phoolka who is a senior advocate of Delhi High Court.

Singh was a votary of greater diplomatic relations with Israel at a time when India did not want to displease Arab nations where thousands of Indians found employment. He visited Israel in the 1970s and was impressed by its progress.

==Personal life==

Khushwant Singh was married to Kanwal Malik. Malik was his childhood friend who had moved to London earlier. They met again when he studied law at King&#x27;s College London, and soon got married. They were married in Delhi, with Chetan Anand and Iqbal Singh as the only invitees. Muhammad Ali Jinnah also attended the formal service. They had a son, named Rahul Singh, and a daughter, named Mala. His wife predeceased him in 2001. Actress Amrita Singh is the daughter of his brother Daljit Singh&#x27;s son – Shavinder Singh and Rukhsana Sultana. He stayed in &quot;Sujan Singh Park&quot;, near Khan Market New Delhi, Delhi&#x27;s first apartment complex, built by his father in 1945, and named after his grandfather.
=== Religious belief ===

Singh was a self-proclaimed agnostic, as the title of his 2011 book &quot;Agnostic Khushwant: There is no God&quot; explicitly revealed. He was particularly against organised religion. He was evidently inclined towards atheism, as he said, &quot;One can be a saintly person without believing in God and a detestable villain believing in him. In my personalised religion, There Is No God!&quot; He also once said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in rebirth or in reincarnation, in the day of judgement or in heaven or hell. I accept the finality of death.&quot; His last book &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ridiculous&quot; was published in October 2013, following which he retired from writing. The book was his continued critique of religion and especially its practice in India, including the critique of the clergy and priests. It earned a lot of acclaim in India. Khushwant Singh had once controversially claimed that Sikhism was a &quot;warrior branch of Hinduism&quot;.

===Death===
Singh died of natural causes on 20 March 2014 at his Delhi residence, at the age of 99. The President, Vice-President and Prime Minister of India all issued messages honouring Singh. He was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in Delhi at 4 in the afternoon of the same day. During his lifetime, Khushwant Singh was keen on burial because he believed that with a burial we give back to the earth what we have taken. He had requested the management of the Baháʼí Faith if he could be buried in their cemetery. After initial agreement, they had proposed some conditions which were unacceptable to Singh, and hence the idea was later abandoned. He was born in Hadali, Khushab District in the Punjab Province of modern Pakistan, in 1915. According to his wishes, some of his ashes were brought and scattered in Hadali.

In 1943 he had already written his own obituary, included in his collection of short stories &quot;Posthumous.&quot; Under the headline &quot;Sardar Khushwant Singh Dead&quot;, the text reads:

He also prepared an epitaph for himself, which runs:
He was cremated and his ashes are buried in Hadali school, where a plaque is placed bearing the inscription:

<text>Artronix Incorporated began in 1970 and has roots in a project in a computer science class at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. The class designed, built and tested a 12-bit minicomputer, which later evolved to become the PC12 minicomputer. The new company entered the bio-medical computing market with a set of peripherals and software for use in Radiation Treatment Planning (see full article and abstract) and ultrasound scanning. Software for the PC12 was written in assembly language and FORTRAN; later software was written in MUMPS. The company was located in two buildings in the Hanley Industrial Park off South Hanley Road in Maplewood, Missouri.

The company later developed another product line of brain-scanning or computed tomography equipment based on the Lockheed SUE 16-bit minicomputer (see also Pluribus); later designs included an optional vector processor using AMD Am2900 bipolar bit-slices to speed tomographic reconstruction calculations. In contrast to earlier designs, the Artronix scanner used a fan-shaped beam with 128 detectors on a rotating gantry. The system would take 540 degrees of data (1½ rotations) to average out noise in the samples. The beam allowed 3mm slices, but several slices would routinely be mathematically combined into one image for display purposes. The first generation of scanners was a head scanner while a later generation was a torso (whole-body) scanner. The CAT-3 (computerized axial tomography) system was a success at first, but the technology surrendered ground to PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) systems. Artronix closed its doors in 1978. A video of the Artronix torso scanner operating without a shroud is available on YouTube at Commissie NVvRadiologie with narration in Dutch.

Artronix was founded by Arne Roestel. Mr. Roestel went on to found Multidata Systems International. For his leadership of Artronix, Mr. Roestel was named as the Small Businessman of the Year for Missouri in 1976 by the Small Business Administration and was hosted at a luncheon by President Gerald Ford (source: Ford Library Museum).

<text>Headford () is a small town in County Galway, located 26 km north of Galway city in the west of Ireland. It is an angling centre for the eastern shore of Lough Corrib, and Greenfields, approximately 6.5 km west of the town, is its boating harbour. The town is situated next to the Black River (known also for its trout angling) which is the county boundary with Mayo. Located on the N84 national secondary road from Galway to Castlebar and the R333, and R334 regional roads, the town is a commuter town to Galway City.

The town is the centre of an area which contains a number of prehistoric burial cairns, Iron Age stone enclosures, early Norman and later castles, and several monastic sites. These include Ross Errilly Friary, located northwest of Headford, which is one of the best preserved monastic ruins of its period in Ireland.

According to 2022 census, there were 1,235 people living in Headford.

==History ==

In his 1837 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;, Samuel Lewis recorded a population of 1,441. He described the town in some detail:

This is a neat and clean town, having been much improved by its proprietor, R. J. Mansergh St. George, Esq.; it has a considerable trade, and commands fine views of Lough Corrib, and the mountains of Joyces&#x27; country and Mayo. It comprises 217 houses, is a chief constabulary police station, and has petty sessions on Mondays; here is also a dispensary. Bobbin lace, coarse linen, and flannel are made. The market is on Tuesday, and fairs are held on May 11th and Oct. 14th. Headford Castle is the residence of R. J. M. St. George, Esq.; it is a handsome modern building, erected on the ruins of the ancient castle; the extensive demesne, which is laid out with great taste, is entered from the town by a good gateway. Here is also Clydagh House, the seat of G. Staunton Lynch, Esq.

The St. George&#x27;s family ownership of the town is explored in &quot;Headford, County Galway, 1775-1901&quot; by Gerardine Candon ().

The tradition of lacemaking in Headford has been covered in exhibitions and public artworks, and in the Irish National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Lace, in a style known as Torchon, is reproduced by modern lacemakers. A public art project, the &quot;Lace Matrix&quot;, created a sculpture of iron and lace to represent the local lace tradition.

==Education==
Headford has a small library with two book clubs - one for children from 8 to 13 years and one for adults.

Headford has one secondary school, Presentation College Headford, which had approximately 780 pupils as of late 2019.

The town itself has two primary schools: Headford Girls National School and St Brendan&#x27;s Boys National School (which is attached to the girls&#x27; school and takes boys from third to sixth class).

There are three primary schools in the surrounding areas, Scoil Naomh Fursa in Claran, Cloughanover National School and Clydagh National School.

==Sports==
Headford is home to a number of sporting clubs and groups, including Corrib Rugby Football Club and Moyne Villa Football Club.

Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) clubs in the area include Headford GAA club and St Fursey&#x27;s Ladies GAA.

There is also a badminton club, karate club and the Black River Game and Conservative Club.

==Politics==
The town is part of the Midlands–North-West constituency for European Parliament elections. It is part of the Galway East constituency for elections to Dáil Éireann, and is part of the Tuam electoral area for Galway County Council elections.

The local polling stations are in the area&#x27;s primary schools.

==Religion==

The Headford Parish has two churches, both of which are Catholic and were built by Fr. Peter Conway and dedicated to St. Mary. The church at Claran was built in 1859 and for many years was the home of the parish priest. The church in Headford was built in 1865 on lands donated by the landlord St. George. Father Ray Flaherty is parish priest of the Headford parish with Fr. Martin Newell (retired) administrating in Claran.

Killursa, a ruined medieval church dedicated to Saint Fursey, lies to the west of Headford, in the Ower townland.

The ruins of Ross Errilly Friary, a 14th or 15th century monastery, lie approximately northwest of the town, and appeared very briefly in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952).

==Twin towns==
Headford is twinned with:
* Le Faouët, Brittany, France.
* Morgan Hill, Santa Clara County, California, United States.

<text>Interstate 630 (I-630) in Arkansas is an east–west connector within Little Rock. It is also known as the Wilbur D. Mills Freeway and starts at I-430 and Shackleford Road as a continuation of Chenal Parkway, traveling east into downtown Little Rock to I-30.

==Route description==
The highway connects burgeoning West Little Rock to the downtown core. It feeds into I-430, a north–south route which serves western Little Rock.

==History==
The project was first conceived in the 1930s and was first planned by the Pulaski County Planning Board in their 1941 report. After having many higher powers deny their plans, construction was started by the city of Little Rock in the 1960s as the East–West Expressway or 8th Street Expressway and was not originally an Interstate or an Arkansas state highway. In the 1970s, US Rep. Wilbur D. Mills was responsible for the route&#x27;s addition to the Interstate System by rounding down the mileage allocations of all other states, then adding the rounding differences to Arkansas&#x27;s total; this kept the total nationwide allocation within the original limit of .

After it was added to the Interstate System, Little Rock initially renamed it for Mills; however, when the Arkansas State Highway Department (AHTD) formally brought it into the state highway system as required by Arkansas law, they removed the name, as their policy at the time prohibited the naming of state highways after individuals. AHTD later changed its policy and readopted the Mills name early in the new millennium. As of autumn 2019, the highway is now named &quot;Gold Star Families Memorial Highway&quot;.

<doc id="1005858" wikidata="Q1456635" url="?curid=1005858" title="Treaty of Lodi">
<text>The Treaty of Lodi, or Peace of Lodi, was a peace agreement to put an end to the Wars in Lombardy between the Venetian Republic and the Duchy of Milan, signed in the city of Lodi on 9 April 1454.

The historical relevance of the treaty lies in having guaranteed the Italian Peninsula 40 years of stable peace, consequently favoring the artistic and literary flowering of the Renaissance.

== Political background ==

After the death of the Duke of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti in 1447, the Golden Ambrosian Republic was proclaimed in Milan. The rulers decided to entrust the defense of the newborn state to Francesco I Sforza. The latter, after three years, proclaimed himself duke of Milan. In fact, for some time Venice had not abandoned its ambitions to expand into Lombardy and thus forged an alliance with Alfonso V of Aragon, king of Naples, and the emperor Frederick III of Habsburg, against Francesco Sforza and his allies. But the fall of Constantinople endangered the safety of the Venetian possessions in the Aegean Sea, so the Serenissima decided to put an end to its wars in the peninsula.

== The treaty ==
Venice and Milan concluded the final peace on April 9, 1454 at the residence of Francesco Sforza in Lodi. The Venetian signatories were Simone da Camerino and Paolo Barbo. The treaty was ratified by the most powerful Italian states, first of all Florentine Republic, which had sided with Milan thanks to the long-standing relationship between Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and Francesco Sforza.

After the treaty, Northern Italy was practically divided between the two states, despite the fact that some other powers persisted: the House of Savoy, the Republic of Genoa, the House of Gonzaga and the House of Este. It also established the succession of Francesco Sforza to the Duchy of Milan, the movement of the frontier between the aforementioned states on the Adda river, the affixing of border signs along the entire demarcation line and the beginning of the Italic League. The lands of Asola, Lonato and Peschiera came under the dominion of the Venetian Republic, disappointing the expectations of the Gonzagas, who had always aimed for these places.

== Historical significance of the treaty ==
The importance of the Treaty of Lodi consists in having given the peninsula a new political-institutional structure which - by limiting the particular ambitions of the various states - ensured a balance of power for 40 years and the development of the Renaissance.

Some scholars have argued that the treaty provided a proto-Westphalian model of an inter-city-state system (as opposed to an inter-&quot;nation-state&quot; system) following a century of warfare in Northern Italy. The Treaty functioned to temporarily institutionalize a regional balance of power in which outright warfare gave way to diplomacy. 

Lorenzo the Magnificent - in the second part of the fifteenth century - became the guarantor of this political equilibrium, implementing his famous &quot;equilibrium policy&quot;.

<text>Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is a class of expendable launch systems operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). GSLV has been used in fifteen launches since 2001.

== History ==
The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) project was initiated in 1990 with the objective of acquiring an Indian launch capability for geosynchronous satellites.

GSLV uses major components that are already proven in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launch vehicles in the form of the S125/S139 solid rocket booster and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine. Due to the thrust required for injecting the satellite in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) the third stage was to be powered by a LOX/LH2 Cryogenic engine which at that time India did not possess or have the technological expertise to build. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories&#x27; 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.

The first development flight of the GSLV (Mk I configuration) was launched on 18 April 2001 was a failure as the payload failed to reach the intended orbit parameters. The launcher was declared operational after the second development flight successfully launched the GSAT-2 satellite. During the initial years from the initial launch to 2014 the launcher had a checkered history with only 2 successful launches out of 7, resulting in the rocket gaining the nickname &quot;naughty boy&quot;.

=== Cryogenic engine controversy ===
The third stage was to be procured from Russian company Glavkosmos, including transfer of technology and design details of the engine based on an agreement signed in 1991. Russia backed out of the deal after United States objected to the deal as in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in May 1992. As a result, ISRO initiated the Cryogenic Upper Stage Project in April 1994 and began developing its own cryogenic engine. A new agreement was signed with Russia for 7 KVD-1 cryogenic stages and 1 ground mock-up stage with no technology transfer, instead of 5 cryogenic stages along with the technology and design as per the earlier agreement. These engines were used for the initial flights and were named GSLV Mk I.

== Vehicle description ==
The tall GSLV, with a lift-off mass of , is a three-stage vehicle with solid, liquid and cryogenic stages respectively. The payload fairing, which is long and in diameter, protects the vehicle electronics and the spacecraft during its ascent through the atmosphere. It is discarded when the vehicle reaches an altitude of about .

GSLV employs S-band telemetry and C-band transponders for enabling vehicle performance monitoring, tracking, range safety / flight safety and preliminary orbit determination. The Redundant Strap Down Inertial Navigation System/Inertial Guidance System of GSLV housed in its equipment bay guides the vehicle from lift-off to spacecraft injection. The digital auto-pilot and closed loop guidance scheme ensure the required altitude maneuver and guide injection of the spacecraft to the specified orbit.

The GSLV can place approximately into an easterly low Earth orbit (LEO) or (for the Mk II version) into an 18° geostationary transfer orbit.

=== Liquid boosters ===
The first GSLV flight, GSLV-D1 used the L40 stage. Subsequent flights of the GSLV used high pressure engines in the strap-on boosters called the L40H. The GSLV uses four L40H liquid strap-on boosters derived from the L37.5 second stage, which are loaded with 42.6 tons of hypergolic propellants (UDMH and N2O4). The propellants are stored in tandem in two independent tanks diameter. The engine is pump-fed and generates of thrust, with a burn time of 150 seconds.

=== First stage ===
GSLV-D1 used the S125 stage which contained of solid propellant and had a burn time of 100 seconds. All subsequent launches have used enhanced propellant loaded S139 stage. The S139 stage is 2.8 m in diameter and has a nominal burn time of 100 seconds.

=== Second stage ===
The GS2 stage is powered by the Vikas engine. It has a diameter of .

=== Third stage ===
The third stage of the GSLV Mark II is propelled by the Indian CE-7.5 cryogenic rocket engine while the older defunct Mark I is propelled using a Russian made KVD-1. It uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) The Indian cryogenic engine was built at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. The engine has a default thrust of but is capable of a maximum thrust of . In GSLV-F14 mission, a new white coloured C15 stage was introduced which has more environmental-friendly manufacturing processes, better insulation properties and the use of lightweight materials.
== Variants ==
GSLV rockets using the Russian Cryogenic Stage (CS) are designated as the GSLV Mark I while versions using the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) are designated the GSLV Mark II. All GSLV launches have been conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.

=== GSLV Mark I ===
The first developmental flight of GSLV Mark I had a 129 tonne (S125) first stage and was capable of launching around 1500 kg into geostationary transfer orbit. The second developmental flight replaced the S125 stage with S139. It used the same solid motor with 138 tonne propellant loading. The chamber pressure in all liquid engines were enhanced, enabling a higher propellant mass and burn time. These improvements allowed GSLV to carry an additional 300 kg of payload. The fourth operational flight of GSLV Mark I, GSLV-F06, had a longer third stage called the C15 with 15 tonne propellant loading and also employed a diameter payload fairing.

=== GSLV Mark II ===
This variant uses an Indian cryogenic engine, the CE-7.5, and is capable of launching 2500 kg into geostationary transfer orbit. Previous GSLV vehicles (GSLV Mark I) have used Russian cryogenic engines.

For launches from 2018, a 6% increased thrust version of the Vikas engine was developed. It was demonstrated on 29 March 2018 in the GSAT-6A launch second stage. It was used for the four Vikas engines first stage boosters on future missions.

A 4m diameter Ogive payload fairing was developed and deployed for the first time in the EOS-03 launch on 12 August 2021, although this launch was a failure due to technical anomalies with the Cryogenic Upper Stage. This will allow GSLV vehicles to accommodate larger payloads.

As of October 2024, ISRO has stopped selling GSLV Mk II Rockets. Eight known launches are planned with NVS Missions, IDRSS Missions, NISAR Mission, etc.

=== RLV-OREX ===
The Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration program, is a prototype spaceplane concept created by ISRO. For the Orbital return Flight experiment, a modified version of the GSLV Mk. II launcher, with the upper Cryogenic Stage replaced with the PS-4 stage from the PSLV is currently in development, as the RLV won&#x27;t need all the excess energy produced by the CUS .

<text>Sarah Victoria Higginson (born December 6, 1969) is a Canadian actress known professionally as Torri Higginson. She is best known for her roles in the &quot;TekWar&quot; movies and series, and for portraying Elizabeth Weir in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (2004–2008), Jordan Hampton in &quot;NCIS&quot; (2007–2009), and Commander Delaney Truffault in &quot;Dark Matter&quot; (2015–2017). She is also a theatre actress and has appeared in &quot;Three Tall Women&quot;, &quot;Weldon Rising&quot;, and &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot;.

==Early life==
Higginson was born in Burlington, Ontario and studied to become an actor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, United Kingdom.

==Career==
In 1995, two years prior to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; premiere, Higginson starred in the movie Jungleground with three other actors from the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise: Peter Williams (Apophis), JR Bourne (Martouf), and Lexa Doig (Dr. Lam). Higginson took over the role of Elizabeth Weir from Jessica Steen in a guest spot on the season eight opener of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. She was then carried over as the leader of the Atlantis expedition on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and continued playing that role until the end of the show&#x27;s third season, afterwards being reduced from a main cast member to a recurring role in the fourth season. She did not reprise the role for the show&#x27;s fifth season.

In 2015, Higginson was cast in the CBC Television drama series &quot;This Life&quot; as Natalie Lawson, a lifestyle columnist and single mother who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. The series ran for two seasons, and was ultimately cancelled on January 24, 2017. In 2016, she portrayed Dr. Kessler on the KindaTV web series &quot;Inhuman Condition&quot;.

In February 2021, it was announced that Higginson, who had a recurring role on the CTV medical series &quot;Transplant&quot;, was upgraded to a regular cast member for season 2 after the rights for the show were acquired by NBC.

<doc id="1005868" wikidata="Q13391536" url="?curid=1005868" title="Tachymeter (watch)">
<text>A tachymeter (pronounced ) is a scale sometimes inscribed around the rim of an analog watch with a chronograph. It can be used to conveniently compute the frequency in inverse-hours of an event of a known second-defined period, such as speed (distance over hours) based on travel time (distance over speed), or measure distance based on speed. The spacings between the marks on the tachymeter dial are therefore proportional to , where &quot;t&quot; is the elapsed time.

The function performed by a tachymeter is independent of the unit of distance (e.g. statute miles, nautical miles, kilometres, metres etc.) as long as the same unit of length is used for all calculations. It can also be used to measure the frequency of any regular event in occurrences per hour, such as the units output by an industrial process. A tachymeter is simply a means of converting &quot;elapsed time&quot; (in seconds per unit) to &quot;rate&quot; (in units per hour).

==Measuring speed ==
To use a tachymeter-equipped watch for measuring speed, the chronograph is started at a starting marker of a known distance. At the next marker, the point on the scale adjacent to the second hand indicates the speed (in distance between markers per hour) of travel between the two. The typical tachymeter scale on a watch converts between the number of seconds it takes for an event to happen and the number of times that event will occur in one hour. The formula used to create this type of tachymeter scale is

:formula_1

where T is the tachymeter scale value; t is the time in seconds that it takes for the event to occur; and 3600 is the number of seconds in an hour.
As a sample calculation, if it takes 35 seconds to travel one mile, then the average speed is 103 miles/hour. On the watch, 35 seconds gives scale value 103. Similarly, if one kilometre takes 35 seconds then the average speed would be 103 km/hour.

Note that the tachymeter scale only calculates the average speed.
As a second example, if it takes 20 seconds to travel one unit of distance, then the average speed on the watch used for the purpose of the picture only is 180 units of distance per hour (examine the picture of the watch which is here to simplify the idea, actual tachymeters may vary slightly).

For events that happen either very quickly or slowly, one can adjust the sixty-second tachymeter scale commonly found on watches. Smaller fractional units can be used for slower objects, but the same X/hour function remains constant. The scale on a watch is only valid for things that happen in 60 seconds or fewer, and the scale is also difficult to resolve for events that take fewer than 10 seconds or so to occur. As an example, if it takes 100 seconds to eat an apple, cutting that number in half allows one to say that it takes 50 seconds to eat half an apple. Using the tachymeter scale one can calculate that 72 half apples (36 whole apples) could be eaten in one hour. Some watches, not common, have &quot;wraparound&quot; or &quot;scroll&quot; scales, which extend the readings to lower speeds, typically 45 units.

==Measuring distance==
A tachymeter-equipped watch can be used to measure distance by timing the travel over the distance while the speed is held constant. The tachymeter scale is rotated to align with the second hand at the start of the length to be measured. When the second hand reaches the point on the scale where the speed indicated equals the speed of the vehicle, one unit of distance (miles if speed is miles per hour, kilometres if kilometres per hour, etc.) has been covered. For example, if you travel at a constant 80 mph (or at 80 km/h), then the distance travelled while the second hand sweeps to &quot;80&quot; (45 seconds) will be exactly 1 mile (or 1 kilometre at 80 km/h).

==Rotating scale==
Some tachymeter scales are on a rotating, indexed bezel. This allows two additional modes of use: The tachymeter bezel can be aligned with a free running second hand, and, more subtly, can be used to find the average speed over longer times/distances. Set the rotary bezel index to the position of the minute hand, note the current mileage/distance. Glance at the position of the minute hand on the tachymeter scale 60 units of distance later, and &quot;average&quot; speed will be indicated. A little mental math allows interim averages, easiest at 1/4 (15 unit) and other integer values. Alternatively, instead of using minute hand, align index bezel to the second hand and observe passing one unit of distance when position of the second hand will then indicate average speed.

<text>James Lee Jamerson (January 29, 1936 – August 2, 1983) was an American bassist. He was the uncredited bassist on most of the Motown Records hits in the 1960s and early 1970s (Motown did not list session musician credits on their releases until 1971), and is now regarded as one of the greatest and most influential bass players in modern music history. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. As a session musician he played on twenty-three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one hits, as well as fifty-six R&amp;B number-one hits.

In its special issue &quot;The 100 Greatest Bass Players&quot; in 2017, &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine ranked Jamerson number one and called him the most important and influential bass guitarist. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Jamerson number one in its list of the 50 greatest bassists of all time.

==Early life==
A native of Edisto Island, South Carolina, he was born to James Jamerson Sr. and Elizabeth Bacon. He was raised in part by his grandmother who played piano, and his aunt who sang in church choir. As a child he was a competent piano player and performed in public. He briefly played the trombone. As a teenager he was a reserved person, and passionate about music. He listened to gospel, blues and jazz music on the radio.

==Motown==
Jamerson moved with his mother to Detroit in 1954. He attended Northwestern High School; there he started on the upright bass. He began playing in Detroit area blues and jazz clubs and was influenced by jazz bassists Ray Brown, Paul Chambers and Percy Heath. He was offered a scholarship to study music at Wayne State University, and he declined. After graduating from high school, he continued performing in Detroit clubs. He joined blues singer Washboard Willie&#x27;s band and later toured with Jackie Wilson. His increasingly solid reputation started providing him opportunities for sessions at various local recording studios. Starting in 1959, he found steady work at Berry Gordy&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. studio, home of the Motown record label. He played bass on the Smokey Robinson single &quot;Way Over There&quot; (1959), John Lee Hooker album &quot;Burnin&quot;&#x27; (1962) and the Reflections&#x27; &quot;(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1964). There he became a member of a core of studio musicians who informally called themselves the Funk Brothers. This close-knit group of musicians performed on the vast majority of Motown recordings during most of the 1960s. Jamerson&#x27;s earliest sessions were performed on double bass but, in the early 1960s, he switched to playing an electric Fender Precision Bass for the most part.

Like Jamerson, most of the Funk Brothers were jazz musicians who had been recruited by Gordy. For many years, they maintained a schedule of recording during the day at Motown&#x27;s small basement &quot;Studio A&quot; (which they nicknamed &quot;the Snakepit&quot;), then playing gigs in jazz clubs at night. They also occasionally toured the U.S. with Motown artists. For most of their career, however, the Funk Brothers went uncredited on Motown singles and albums, and their pay was considerably less than that received by the main artists or the label, hence their occasional freelance work elsewhere. Eventually, Jamerson was put on retainer for $1,000 a week (US$ in dollars), which afforded him and his expanding family a comfortable lifestyle.

Jamerson&#x27;s discography at Motown reads as a catalog of soul hits of the 1960s and early 1970s. His work includes hits such as, among hundreds of others, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes, &quot;My Girl&quot; by the Temptations, &quot;Shotgun&quot; by Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars, &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; and &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot; by Stevie Wonder, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; by the Miracles, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; by Martha and the Vandellas, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips and later by Marvin Gaye, and most of the album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; by Marvin Gaye, &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;Bernadette&quot; by the Four Tops. He occasionally recorded for other labels, such as &quot;Boom Boom&quot; by John Lee Hooker in 1962 and &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; by Jackie Wilson in 1967. Motown released 537 singles in 1960s and over 200 albums. According to fellow Funk Brothers in the 2002 documentary &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;, Gaye was desperate to have Jamerson play on &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, and went to several bars to find the bassist. When he did, he brought Jamerson to the studio, but Jamerson was too intoxicated to stay upright, so James played the classic line while lying flat on his back. He stopped touring in 1964 and began to do studio work on a full-time basis. 

Jamerson is reported to have played on nearly every Motown recording between 1963 and 1968, which includes over 60 top-fifteen pop singles. He performed on 23 number-one hits on the pop charts, a record narrowly surpassed only by Paul McCartney of the Beatles, who cites Jamerson as his biggest influence. Jamerson also performed on 56 number-one hits on the R&amp;B charts.

==Style and influence==

Jamerson is noted for expanding the musical style and role of bass playing in popular music of the time, which, (in 1950s and &#x27;60s R&amp;B, rock and roll, and country), largely consisted of root notes, fifths and simple, repetitive patterns. By contrast, many of Jamerson&#x27;s basslines relied heavily on chromatic runs, syncopation, ghost notes and inversions, with frequent use of open strings. His nimble bass playing was considered an integral part of the &quot;Motown Sound&quot;. He created melodic lines that were nonetheless locked to the drum groove.

Jamerson&#x27;s transition from upright to electric bass was at a time when electric bass was a relatively new instrument, and its use and style of play was not well established. Jamerson&#x27;s background as a jazz musician and upright bassist informed his playing style, and over time his technique and improvisational approach became more nuanced. By mid-1960s, his style became an indispensable part of the Motown sound and in turn impacted popular music. Early examples of Jamerson&#x27;s impact are &quot;Rescue Me&quot; by Fontella Bass and &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; by the Beatles.

In a 1983 interview with &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, Jamerson said Motown&#x27;s songwriting-production team &quot;would give me the chord sheet, but they couldn&#x27;t write for me. When they did, it didn&#x27;t sound right. (...) When they gave me that chord sheet, I&#x27;d look at it, but then start doing what I felt and what I thought would fit. (...) I&#x27;d hear the melody line from the lyrics and I&#x27;d build the bass line around that.&quot;

Bassists who have noted Jamerson&#x27;s contribution or been influenced by him include Rocco Prestia, Anthony Jackson, Pino Palladino, Paul McCartney, Bob Babbitt, Nathan Watts, Will Lee, Geddy Lee, Chuck Rainey, Marcus Miller, Mike Mills, Phil Chen, John Entwistle, Michael League, Mike Watt, Sting, John Paul Jones, Bernard Odum, Victor Wooten, Robert DeLeo, Glenn Hughes, Tommy Shannon, Suzi Quatro, Ron Asheton, Tony Sales, Peter Cetera, Robert Kool Bell, Bootsy Collins, Flea, Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Michael Henderson, Jack Bruce, John Patitucci, Jason Newsted, Rick Danko, Garry Tallent, Alan Gorrie, Jerry Jemmott, Andy Fraser, Brian Wilson and others.

==Post-Motown career==
Shortly after Motown moved their headquarters to Los Angeles in 1972, Jamerson moved there himself and found occasional studio work, but his relationship with Motown officially ended in 1973. He went on to perform on such 1970s hits as &quot;Neither One of Us&quot; by Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips (1973), &quot;Boogie Down&quot; (Eddie Kendricks, 1974), &quot;Then Came You&quot; (Dionne Warwick &amp; the Spinners, 1974), &quot;Boogie Fever&quot; (The Sylvers, 1976), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Star&quot; (Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., 1976), and &quot;Heaven Must Have Sent You&quot; (Bonnie Pointer, 1979). He also played on recordings by Robert Palmer (&quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, 1975), Dennis Coffey (&quot;Instant Coffey&quot;, 1974), Wah Wah Watson (&quot;Elementary&quot;, 1976), Al Wilson (1977), Dennis Wilson (&quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;, 1977), Eloise Laws (1977), Smokey Robinson (1978), Ben E. King (1978), Hubert Laws (1979), Tavares (1980), Joe Sample/David T. Walker (&quot;Swing Street Cafe&quot;, 1981), and Bloodstone (1982). However, in Los Angeles, Jamerson was not working with a steady group of musicians, and he was not as free to improvise. He felt out of place and over time his increased dependence on alcohol affected his work. As other musicians went on to use high-tech amplifiers, round-wound strings, and simpler, more repetitive bass lines incorporating new techniques like slapping, Jamerson&#x27;s style fell out of favor with local producers as he was reluctant to try new things. By the 1980s he was unable to get any serious gigs working as a session musician.

==Personal life and death==
Jamerson married Annie Wells shortly before graduating from high school. They had four children. His son, James Jamerson Jr. (1957–2016), was a professional session bassist and a member of the disco band Chanson. He had two other sons, Joey and Derek, and a daughter, Dorene (Penny).

Long troubled by alcoholism, Jamerson died of complications from cirrhosis, heart failure and pneumonia on August 2, 1983, in Los Angeles. He is interred at Detroit&#x27;s historic Woodlawn Cemetery.

==Recognition==
Motown&#x27;s founder Berry Gordy called Jamerson an &quot;incredible improviser&quot; and said &quot;I, like some of the other producers, would not do a session unless at least two of the Funk Brothers were present – namely, [drummer] Benny Benjamin and James Jamerson.&quot; However, Jamerson, along with the other Funk Brothers, received little formal recognition for his lifetime contributions. His work was uncredited until later in his career, and he remained largely anonymous, even to bassists who emulated his style. The first time he was credited on a major Motown release was in 1971 for his performance on Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. He was noted as &quot;the incomparable James Jamerson&quot; on the record&#x27;s sleeve.

Jamerson was the subject of a book by Allan Slutsky in 1989 titled &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;. The book includes a biography of Jamerson, transcriptions of his bass lines, two CDs in which 25 bassists such as Pino Palladino, John Entwistle, Chuck Rainey, and Geddy Lee speak about Jamerson and play the transcriptions. His story was featured in the subsequent 2002 documentary film of the same title. Jamerson&#x27;s work has continued to be the subject of various publications.

Jamerson was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, among the first-ever group of &quot;sidemen&quot; to be inducted. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004, and he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2007 both as a member of the Funk Brothers. In 2009 he was inducted into the Fender Hall of Fame by fellow Motown session bassist and friend, Bob Babbitt. He received the &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. He received the Samson, Hartke and Zoom International Bassist Award in 2012. He was awarded a bust at the Hollywood Guitar Center&#x27;s Rock Walk, and in 2013 the Funk Brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2015 songwriter and bassist Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys named Jamerson as his favorite bassist.

Jamerson has received several accolades in his home state of South Carolina. These include a two-day tribute hosted by the Charleston Jazz Initiative and the College of Charleston&#x27;s Avery Research Center (2003), the Gullah/GeeChee Anointed Spirit Award (2008), the Independent Tone Award for lifetime achievement (2016), the Dr. Martin Luther King Dream Keeper Award (2018), induction to the Lowcountry Music Hall of Fame (2018), induction to the Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame (2018). Also, the South Carolina Senate, the House of Representatives and the town of Edisto Island have passed resolutions in recognition of his contributions.

==Jamerson&#x27;s equipment==
Jamerson started on a school-owned upright bass. After graduating from high school, he bought a German upright bass which he later used on such Motown hits as &quot;My Guy&quot; by Mary Wells and &quot;Heat Wave&quot; by Martha and the Vandellas. This instrument is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 1960 to 1961 he transitioned to electric bass. Jamerson played mainly the Fender Precision Bass, but is known to have briefly used a Fender Bass V and a Hagström eight-string later in his career. He continued to use the upright bass occasionally, as in 1964&#x27;s &quot;My Guy&quot;.

His first electric bass was a refinished 1957 Precision, nicknamed &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. The bass was previously owned by his fellow bass player Horace &quot;Chili&quot; Ruth. The instrument was soon stolen, leading him to replace it with an early sixties sunburst Precision, although this was stolen too.

He then acquired a stock 1962 Fender Precision Bass, which would become his primary instrument for most of his career. It was nicknamed &quot;The Funk Machine&quot; by his fellow musicians. It had a three-tone sunburst finish, a tortoiseshell pickguard, rosewood fretboard and chrome pickup and bridge covers (the latter containing a piece of foam used to dampen sustain and some overtones). On the heel of the instrument, he carved the word &quot;FUNK&quot; in blue ink. He typically set its volume and tone knobs on full. This instrument was also stolen, just days before Jamerson&#x27;s death in 1983, and never recovered.

Jamerson used La Bella heavy-gauge (.052–.110) flatwound strings which were never replaced, unless a string broke. He did not particularly take care of the instrument, as he stated: &quot;The dirt keeps the funk&quot;. The neck may have eventually warped, as many claimed it was impossible to play. While this made it more difficult to fret, Jamerson believed it improved the quality of the tone. In the mid-1970s, a producer attempted to modernize Jamerson&#x27;s sound by asking the bassist to switch to brighter-sounding roundwound bass strings, but Jamerson politely declined.

One aspect of Jamerson&#x27;s upright playing that carried over to the electric bass guitar was the fact that he generally used only his right index finger to pluck the strings while resting his third and fourth fingers on the chrome pickup cover. Jamerson&#x27;s index finger even earned its own nickname: &quot;The Hook&quot;. Another aspect of Jamerson&#x27;s upright playing that carried over was his use of open strings, a technique long used by jazz bass players, to pivot around the fretboard which served to give his lines a fluid feeling. He played with a relaxed and light touch.

Jamerson&#x27;s amplifier of choice at club performances was an Ampeg B-15; in larger venues, he used a blue Kustom with twin 15-inch speakers. On both, the bass knob was typically turned up full and the treble turned halfway up. On most of his studio recordings, his bass was plugged directly into the custom-made mixing console together with the guitars from Eddie Willis, Robert White and Joe Messina. He adjusted the console so that his sound was slightly overdriven and had a mild tube compression.

In 2017, it was reported that Jamerson gave a 1961 Fender Precision bass to bassist Billy Hayes in 1967 or 1968. This instrument is in the Musicians Hall of Fame. In 1977, Jamerson was photographed with a 1965–1968 Precision bass (a line of instruments which had a transition logo). There is speculation that in mid to late-1960s Jamerson&#x27;s then-primary instrument was parted with, and that he acquired and replaced it with a 1966 model.

<doc id="1005874" wikidata="Q211364" url="?curid=1005874" title="Principle">
<text>A principle may relate to a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of beliefs or behavior or a chain of reasoning. They provide a guide for behavior or evaluation. A principle can make values explicit, so they are expressed in the form of rules and standards. Principles unpack the values underlying them more concretely so that the values can be more easily operationalized in policy statements and actions. 

In law, higher order, overarching principles establish rules to be followed, modified by sentencing guidelines relating to context and proportionality. In science and nature, a principle may define the essential characteristics of the system, or reflect the system&#x27;s designed purpose. The effective operation would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored. A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM&#x27;s 360/370 &quot;Principles of Operation&quot;. It is important to differentiate an operational principle, including reference to &#x27;first principles&#x27; from higher order &#x27;guiding&#x27; or &#x27;exemplary&#x27; principles, such as equality, justice and sustainability. Higher-order, &#x27;superordinate&#x27; principles (Super-Ps) provide a basis for resolving differences and building agreement/alignment.

Examples of principles are, entropy in a number of fields, least action in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: doctrines or assumptions forming normative rules of conduct, separation of church and state in statecraft, the central dogma of molecular biology, in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being &quot;unprincipled&quot;, is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only &quot;in principle&quot; but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society. To &quot;act on principle&quot; is to act in accordance with one&#x27;s moral ideals. Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of socialization. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained. Exemplary principles include First, do no harm, the Golden Rule and the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;.

===As a juridic law===

It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle conditioning of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the territorial principle, homestead principle, and precautionary principle.

===As scientific law===
Archimedes principle, relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a law in science. Another early one developed by Malthus is the &quot;population principle&quot;, now called the Malthusian principle. Freud also wrote on principles, especially the reality principle necessary to keep the id and pleasure principle in check. Biologists use the principle of priority and principle of Binominal nomenclature for precision in naming species. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in cosmology which observes the mediocrity principle, the anthropic principle, the principle of relativity and the cosmological principle. Other well-known principles include the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and the pigeonhole principle and superposition principle in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===

The principle states that every event has a rational explanation. The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity &quot;x&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;x&quot; exists.
:For every event &quot;e&quot;, if &quot;e&quot; occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;e&quot; occurs.
:For every proposition &quot;p&quot;, if &quot;p&quot; is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;p&quot; is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that &quot;the Earth is round&quot;, corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
According to Aristotle, &quot;It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.&quot; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and does not rain.

===Principle of excluded middle===

The principle of the excluding third or &quot;principium tertium exclusum&quot; is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by Leibniz as: either &quot;A&quot; is &quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;B&quot;. It is read the following way: either &quot;P&quot; is true, or its denial ¬&quot;P&quot; is.
It is also known as &quot;tertium non datur&quot; (&#x27;A third (thing) is not&#x27;). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, non-contradiction and sufficient reason).

<doc id="1005876" wikidata="Q369065" url="?curid=1005876" title="Knights of Ramune">
<text>Knights of Ramune, known in Japan as , is a Japanese original video animation series that follows the adventures of Cacao and Parfait, holy virgins, in their search and rescue mission of the 4th Warrior Ramunes, given to them by the apparent head of their religious order, Master Follower. They are joined in these adventures by Lemon, a twelve-year-old girl, and PQ, a hand-sized blob with a face that is an expert on spiritual topics. The OAV is known as VS Knight Ramune &amp; 40 Fresh in Japan, and is a sequel to &quot;VS Knight Ramune &amp; 40 Fire&quot;, an anime television series; it was released in the U.S. by Software Sculptors and Central Park Media.

== Characters ==
* Cacao - A full-fledged holy virgin, she has strong magical powers. The dark-skinned girl explains that this magic works best when the body is unconstricted, and is thus naked at various points throughout the show.
* Parfait - Unlike Cacao, Parfait is still in training as holy virgin. Beyond the third episode of the OAV, she pilots an experimental mecha naked, as the cockpit is filled with water as a shock absorber.
* PQ (alternately spelled Piqu) - A hand-sized spiritual advisor, PQ often says things that embarrass Parfait, and endures various forms of physical abuse throughout the show, such as being thrown, stretched, and stepped on.
* Lemon - A twelve-year-old girl, Lemon joins Parfait and Cacao after they rescue her and a large group of children. Her name is an obvious pun, as &quot;Lemon&quot; is a slang term for explicit anime and manga.

* Ramunes IV - Upon being sent by magic to the Giga Genos, a large spaceship, Parfait and Cacao find Ramunes IV, who is cruelly sadistic. He also attempted to rape Cacao.

== Storyline ==
Parfait, Cacao, and PQ are sent by their religious order to find the Fourth Warrior Ramunes. They arrive on the Giga Genos, and are immediately surprised to find it in battle with the defensive forces of a planet, which are subsequently destroyed. The Giga Genos then orbitally bombards the major cities of the planet below. Parfait and Cacao find a large group of children who are being held captive. The two holy virgins defeat the guards, release the children using escape pods, and sabotage the ship.

Some more guards find them, and they are pursued until they run into Ramunes IV. He explains that the entire galaxy must be united under his rule to prevent an upcoming disaster. Shocked by his cruel nature, especially in comparison to the Ramunes III they knew, they continue running and fall into an experimental mech during a fight, where they find Lemon and are then thrown into space and fall to the planet below, protected by Cacao&#x27;s holy magic.

Reminded of her duty to serve Ramunes, Cacao meets him at a lake on the planet surface. Ramunes tells her that he is aware of her feeling of amorousness toward the third warrior, and, by extension, himself. Enraged, Electone later attacks Cacao, while Parfait attempts to rescue her from Ramunes, but fails when Electone, acting on Ramunes&#x27; orders, retrieves Cacao from the water.

Ramune&#x27;s followers begin excavation of the Dark Knight, allowing PQ, Lemon, and Parfait to sneak aboard the Giga Ginos and make another rescue attempt. While escaping, they find the injured Don Vodka, who explains that the man claiming to be Ramunes is a pretender, chosen as a young boy to act as a leader for the people until the real Ramunes was found, and that he now intends to activate the Dark Knight, which will cause the planet to be destroyed. Electone, shocked that Ramunes has left without her for the Dark Knight, enters, kills Don Vodka for suggesting that Ramunes is an impostor, and begins fighting the Holy Virgins; she is defeated. The Giga Genos falls to the planet below, and Parfait, Cacao, PQ, and Lemon exit in the experimental mech.

Electone emerges from the wreckage and enters the Dark Knight. The fake Ramunes activated it, causing the mech to reject him. Electone finds him and reminisces about how she has helped raise him and lived by his side as his assistant and lover; he notes with surprise that he has lived his whole life as the Warrior Ramunes and wonders how this could not be the truth as he dies from the Dark Knight&#x27;s attack. Electone reactivates the Dark Knight, causing it to spew out energy over the planet&#x27;s surface, but is killed when Cacao and Parfait attack and enter it with the help of Ramune&#x27;s former followers, who have recognized that they have been misled.

Parfait and Cacao enter the Dark Knight&#x27;s control room, but are unable to stop the destruction that it is unleashing. Lemon enters, and the Dark Knight acknowledges her as the true Warrior Ramunes. She orders the giant mech to stand down, thus saving the world.

After the credits of the sixth episode, we are treated to a trailer of &quot;Knights of Lemon&quot;, which supposedly would show Lemon&#x27;s further adventures, but no such product has been yet released.

<text>Interstate 530 (I-530) in Arkansas is a spur route of the Interstate highway system, traveling from Pine Bluff north-northwest to Little Rock at an interchange of I-30 and I-440. The highway also travels through the cities of Redfield and White Hall. In the future, I-530 will be extended south to I-69 west of Monticello. A short section near the future I-69 alignment has been signed as Highway 530.

==Route description==
The route begins at a high volume interchange with I-30/I-440/US 65/US 67/US 167 in southeast Little Rock. This intersection handles over 100,000 vehicles per day on average. I-530 runs south with US 65 and US 167 through marshland, entering Saline County briefly to split with US 167 south (exit 10). At exit 10, the junction can only accessed by southbound I-530. Northbound I-530 must take exit 9 then come back southbound to access exit 10. After returning to Pulaski County, I-530 has an exit at Hensley with Hensley Road (exit 15, which also connects to AR 365) before entering Jefferson County.

I-530 continues south, passing through forested land and clear cut areas, also running parallel to AR 365. I-530 intersects AR 46 (exit 20) in Redfield before entering White Hall. After an intersection with AR 256 (Holland Avenue, exit 32), the route runs south to serve as the eastern terminus for US 270 at exit 34. This exit also contains Highway 365 Spur (AR 365 Spur) eastbound to White Hall and Sheridan Street. Continuing south to Pine Bluff, I-530 serves as a beltway around the city. I-530 skirts the city to the southwest, including exits for AR 190 (West 19th Street, exit 37), US 79/U.S. Highway 79 Business (US 79B, South Camden Road, exit 39), and US 63/AR 463 (South Olive Street, exit 43).

The Interstate ends at a very large junction with US 63/US 65/US 65B/US 79/US 425/AR 190, after which the roadway continues south as US 65/US 425 toward Dumas.

This Interstate Highway is unusual in that its exit number increase south rather than north. However, the standard for spurs is to increase from the beginning at the parent.

===I-530 State Scenic Byway===
I-530 is designated as one of ten Arkansas Scenic Byways for from AR 256 northwest of White Hall to US 65 in southern Pine Bluff. The route passes over Bayou Bartholomew and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The southern portion was formerly a wetland preserve, but now the land is being developed.

==History==

The current route was formerly designated as US 65. Today, I-530 and US 65 run concurrently as a four-lane freeway spur. The route formally gained the I-530 designation after a full Interstate-grade bypass of Pine Bluff (known locally as the Wiley Branton Highway) replaced an expressway section of US 65 through Pine Bluff that contains at-grade intersections. This segment (known locally as the Martha Mitchell Expressway) was redesignated US 65B; US 65 was rerouted to the bypass before gaining the I-530 codesignation.

==Exit list==









==Arkansas Highway 530==

A planned extension of the route pushes the Interstate south to US 278 in Wilmar. The first segment of the extension from US 278 north to Highway 35 opened as a two-lane expressway designated Arkansas Highway 530 (AR 530) on June 6, 2006. This extension is intended to connect to the proposed southern extension of I-69; US 278 at Wilmar also provides four-lane access to the future I-530 from the larger cities of Warren and Monticello, thus allowing both to champion its completion. Though sufficient right-of-way was provided and grading done for interchanges at both ends as well as two additional lanes, this segment presently has stop signs at both ends and an intersection with Bradley County Road 96 (CR 96)/Barkada Road.

The second segment of the extension opened in September 2013. It connects the I-530 interchange in Pine Bluff with Highway 11 in Lincoln County and is in length. Currently, the segment is two lanes until further funding is available.

The remaining segments between Highway 35 and Pine Bluff will also be built as a two-lane expressway, similar to the existing Highway 35–US 278 segment and Pine Bluff intersection to Highway 114 segment. Initially, the only full interchange will be with the present I-530 at Pine Bluff; grade crossings will be built at other planned interchanges, but the stretches between grade crossings will be true two-lane freeways with grade separations and service roads where needed. The route includes sufficient right-of-way to build interchanges and two additional lanes later; the Pine Bluff interchange will be a full freeway-to-freeway facility designed for the future four-lane freeway. On August 18, 2015, the next segment—Highway 114 to Highway 11—was opened to traffic. The segment from AR 11 to AR 35 is not yet built. Eventually, the completed route will extend 88 miles from Little Rock to I-69 near Monticello.

<text>Rachel Zawadi Luttrell (born 19 January 1971) is a Tanzanian-born Canadian actress best known for her role as Teyla Emmagan in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (2004–2009).

== Early life ==
Luttrell was born 19 January 1971, in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, the daughter of Veronica Makihio Shenkunde Luttrell of the Washambala tribe of the Usambara Mountains, and Dr. William Leon Luttrell from Bossier City, Louisiana. She is one of four daughters. Her family emigrated to Canada when she was five years old, and she was raised in Toronto. Her family has several musical roots; her father, a former member of the critically acclaimed Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, trained Luttrell&#x27;s soprano voice. She studied ballet at the Russian Academy of Classical Ballet School and also studied piano at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto.

== Career ==
Luttrell made her professional debuts in Canada&#x27;s premier production of &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; in Toronto, and as &quot;The Enchantress&quot; in the Canadian production of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. She would go on to appear in many other stage productions, such as &quot;Once On This Island&quot;, &quot;Goblin Market&quot;, and the premier performance of Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Lynn Nottage&#x27;s &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. 

Following a move to Los Angeles, Luttrell became frustrated with some of the minor roles she was offered to her at the time, and considered giving up on her acting career to enroll at the UCLA to study architecture. She ventured to the UK instead and studied at the British American Drama Association on a midsummer course at Balliol College, Oxford.

In 2004, Luttrell was cast in a main role as Athosian warrior-leader Teyla Emmagan on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. She remained in this role for 99 episodes until the end of the series in 2009.

She also appeared in the Canadian movie &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;, which was directed by her &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; co-star David Hewlett.

In 2011 Luttrell ventured into jazz music, releasing her first album &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;, produced by Gerrit Kinkel and featuring artists like double bass player Jennifer Leitham, Graham Dechter, and Konrad Paszkudzki, and drummer Jeff Hamilton.

== Personal life ==
Luttrell married Loyd Bateman, a former stunt performer in 2007; they have two children together, her son Caden (born 2007) and daughter Ridley (born 2012). Luttrell has two younger sisters, Erica Luttrell, who is also an actress, and Amanda Luttrell Garrigus, who is an on-air personality for fashion and entertainment.

<doc id="1005883" wikidata="Q1256780" url="?curid=1005883" title="Revolving door">
<text>A revolving door typically consists of three or four doors that hang on a central shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a cylindrical enclosure. To use a revolving door, a person enters the enclosure between two of the doors and then moves continuously to the desired exit while keeping pace with the doors.

Revolving doors were designed to relieve the immense pressure caused by air rushing through high-rise buildings (referred to as stack effect pressure) while at the same time allowing large numbers of people to pass in and out. They are also energy efficient; they act as an airlock to prevent drafts, decreasing the loss of heating or cooling for the building as compared to a standard door.

== Construction ==

Around the central shaft of the revolving door, there are usually three or four panels called &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;leaves&quot;. Large diameter revolving doors can accommodate pushchairs and wheeled luggage racks - such large capacity doors are sometimes H-shaped to split the circle into only two (hence larger) parts.

Some revolving door displays incorporate a small glass enclosure, permitting small objects such as sculpture, fashion mannequins, or plants to be displayed to pedestrians passing through. Such enclosures can either be mounted at the central pivot, or attached to the revolving door wings.

The wings of revolving doors usually incorporate glass, to allow people to see and anticipate each other while passing through the door. Manual revolving doors rotate with pushbars, causing all wings to rotate. Revolving doors typically have a &quot;speed control&quot; (governor) to prevent people from spinning the doors too fast.

Automatic revolving doors are powered above/below the central shaft, or along the perimeter. Automatic revolving doors have safety sensors, but there has been at least one fatality recorded.

Skyscraper design requires a means of draft block, such as revolving doors, to prevent the chimney effect of the tall structure from sucking in air at high speed at the base and ejecting it through vents in the roof while the building is being heated, or sucking in air through the vents and ejecting it through the doors while being cooled, both effects due to convection. Modern revolving doors permit the individual doors of the assembly to be unlocked from the central shaft to permit free flowing traffic in both directions. This feature, called &quot;breakout&quot; or &quot;break away&quot;, is typically used only during emergencies, or to admit oversize objects. The most effective method for this is the &quot;bookfold&quot; design, which allows all three or four wings to be broken away together. Normally, the revolving door is always closed so that wind and drafts cannot blow into the building, to efficiently minimize heating and air conditioning loads.

In right-hand traffic countries, revolving doors typically revolve counter-clockwise (as seen from above), allowing people to enter and exit only on the right side of the door. In left-hand traffic countries such as Australia and New Zealand, revolving doors revolve clockwise, but door rotations are mixed in Britain. Direction of rotation is often enforced by the door governor mechanism, or by the orientation of the door seal brush (weatherstrips).

==Security==
Revolving doors can also be used as security devices to restrict entry to a single person at a time if the spacing between the doors is small enough. This is in contrast to a normal door which allows a second person to easily &quot;tailgate&quot; behind an authorized person. Extreme security can require a particular type of bullet-resistant glass.

Sometimes a revolving door is designed for one-way traffic. An example is the now-common usage in airports to prevent a person from bypassing airport security checkpoints by entering the exit. Such doors are designed with a brake that is activated by a sensor should someone enter from the incorrect side. The door also revolves backwards to permit that person to exit, while also notifying security of the attempt.
Turnstile exit-only doors are also often used in subways and other rapid transit facilities to prevent people from bypassing fare payment. They are similarly used at large sports stadiums, amusement parks, and other such venues, to allow pedestrians to exit freely, but not to enter without paying admission fees. These doors usually work mechanically, with the door panels constructed of horizontal bars which pass through a &quot;wall&quot; of interlacing (interdigitated) bars, allowing the door leaves to pass through, but blocking people from illegally entering through the exit.

== Emergency use ==
On November 28, 1942, the Cocoanut Grove, a popular nightclub in Boston, Massachusetts, went up in flames, killing 492 people. One of the main reasons cited for the large number of casualties was the single revolving door located at the entrance. As the mob of panicking patrons attempted to use the door as an escape it soon became jammed, trapping countless people between the door and the crowd pushing towards it. As a result, many people died from smoke inhalation, as they were not able to escape the burning nightclub.

In 1943, it became a Massachusetts state law requirement to flank a revolving door with an outward swinging hinged door or to make the revolving door collapsible (so it becomes a double partition collapsing at 180°), allowing people to pass on either side. American revolving doors are now collapsible. Some jurisdictions require them to be flanked by at least one hinged door either by common practice or required by law. For example, the Ontario Building Code 3.4.6.14. asserts that revolving doors needs to &quot;(a) be collapsible, (b) have hinged doors providing equivalent exiting capacity located adjacent to it&quot;.

== History ==


H. Bockhacker of Berlin was granted German patent DE18349 on December 22, 1881 for or , which used a rotating cylinder with a door which after entering, the user then turned around to the exiting direction.

Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia was granted US patent 387,571 on August 7, 1888, for a &quot;Storm-Door Structure&quot;. The patent drawings filed show a three-partition revolving door. The patent describes it as having &quot;three radiating and equidistant wings ... provided with weather-strips or equivalent means to insure [&quot;sic&quot;] a snug fit&quot;. The door &quot;possesses numerous advantages over a hinged-door structure ... it is perfectly noiseless ... effectually prevents the entrance of wind, snow, rain or dust ...&quot; &quot;Moreover, the door cannot be blown open by the wind ... there is no possibility of collision, and yet persons can pass both in and out at the same time.&quot; The patent further lists, &quot;the excluding of noises of the street&quot; as another advantage of the revolving door. It goes on to describe how a partition can be hinged so as to open to allow the passage of long objects through the revolving door. The patent itself does not use the term &quot;revolving door&quot;.

An urban legend, dating back to perhaps 2008, claims that the invention was motivated by his phobia of opening doors for others, especially women; according to Snopes, there is no evidence to support this.

In 1889, the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia awarded the John Scott Legacy Medal to Van Kannel for his contribution to society. In 1899, the world&#x27;s first wooden revolving door was installed at Rector&#x27;s, a restaurant on Times Square in Manhattan, located on Broadway between West 43rd and 44th Streets. In 2007 Theophilus Van Kannel was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for this invention.

== Research ==

Research into the air and energy exchanges associated with revolving door usage have been carried out on a few occasions. The earliest such study was carried out in 1936 by , who worked for the van Kannel revolving door company at the time. Simpson&#x27;s study was followed by a study by Schutrum et al. in 1961, and more recently a study by van Schijndel et al. in 2003. These studies focused on providing detailed measurements of the quantities of air and heat transferred inside the compartments of a door as it revolves. With the exception of the study by van Schijndel et al., which was purely theoretical, the measurements carried out for the other studies were used to provide design charts enabling engineers to estimate the quantity of air transferred by a door in function of the revolution rate and temperature contrast. However, none of these studies are referenced by existing design codes.

The aforementioned studies are specific to the type of door which they were acquired for, namely doors with four compartments. Although it appears that these dimensions were standard for four-compartment doors at the time, this is not the case nowadays. A more recent experimental study carried out at Imperial College London&#x27;s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, provided more insight into the flow physics by which air is transferred across a revolving door.

Airflows and energy losses through revolving doors also occur as a result of leakages past the seals of the door. Leakages are common to any type of opening in an otherwise closed space, but have been investigated in the context of revolving doors by Zmeureanu et al. and by Schutrum et al. before that. The first study concluded that to avoid significant leakages, the seals of the doors should be maintained and periodically replaced if needed. The second study produced design charts for estimating the leakage rate through a revolving door. Unlike the curves for estimating the transfer rate also published in this study, the curves for estimating the leakage rate are more generic. As such these design curves still form the basis of the target leakage rates for revolving doors recommended by the ASHRAE standard 90.1 in the US. On May 25, 2006, an MIT Study entitled &quot;Modifying Habits Towards Sustainability: A Study of Revolving Doors Usage on the MIT Campus&quot; was published. In it, B. A. Cullum, Olivia Lee, Sittha Sukkasi and Dan Wesolowski concluded, &quot;...substantial energy is saved when people use the revolving doors instead of swing doors – the smallest of habit changes contributes to energy conservation... Modification of one habit... indeed has the ability to eventually impact the environment on a global scale.&quot;

While preferred by building owners for energy conservation, revolving doors may be avoided by some people due to the perceived greater physical effort in using them.

<doc id="1005900" wikidata="Q154828" url="?curid=1005900" title="Berlin Zoo">
<text>The Berlin Zoological Garden (, ) is the oldest surviving and best-known zoo in Germany. Opened in 1844, it covers and is located in Berlin&#x27;s Tiergarten. With about 1,380 different species and over 20,200 animals, the zoo presents one of the most comprehensive collections of species in the world.

The zoo and its aquarium had more than 3.5 million visitors in 2017. It is the most-visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. Regular animal feedings are among its most famous attractions. Globally known animals like Knut, the polar bear, and , the giant panda have contributed to the zoo&#x27;s public image.

The zoo collaborates with many universities, research institutes, and other zoos around the world. It maintains and promotes European breeding programmes, helps safeguard several endangered species, and participates in several species reintroduction programs.

== History ==

Opened on 1 August 1844, the Zoologischer Garten Berlin was the second zoo in Germany after the short-lived &quot;Thiergarten&quot; in Hamburg-Horn. The aquarium opened in 1913. The first animals were donated by Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, from the menagerie at Pfaueninsel island and pheasantry of the Tiergarten. The nearby U-Bahn station was opened in 1882.

===Third Reich===
In 1938, the Berlin Zoo got rid of Jewish board members and forced Jewish shareholders to sell their stocks at a loss, before re-selling the stocks in an effort to Aryanize the institution. Starting in 1939, Jews were also prevented from visiting the zoo. Zoo director Lutz Heck was named chief of the Oberste Naturschütz Behörde im Reichsforstamt (highest nature preservation agency in the state department of forestry) by his friend Hermann Göring in the summer of 1938 and in this capacity he was the senior responsible person for the entire nature management.

===World War II===
During World War II, the zoo area was hit by Allied bombs for the first time on 8 September 1941. Most damage was done during the bombardments on 22 and 23 November 1943.

In less than 15 minutes, 30% of the zoo population was killed on the first day, and on the second day the aquarium building was completely destroyed by a direct hit. Of the eight elephants, only one survived, the bull Siam; two-year-old hippo bull Knautschke was saved from the gunfire in his animal house. Most damage was done during the Battle of Berlin: from 22 April 1945 onwards, the zoo was under constant artillery fire of the Red Army. Heavy fighting took place in the zoo area through 30 April, and safety measures forced the zoo keepers to kill some predators and other dangerous animals.

Next to the zoo stood the Zoo Tower, a huge flak tower that was one of the last remaining areas of Nazi German resistance against the Red Army, with its bunkers and anti-aircraft weapons defending against Allied air forces. At the entrance of the zoo, there was a small underground shelter for zoo visitors and keepers. During the battle, wounded German soldiers were taken care of here by female personnel and the wives of zookeepers. On 30 April, the zoo flak bunker surrendered.

A count on 31 May 1945 revealed only 91 of 3,715 animals had survived, including two lion cubs, two hyenas, Asian bull elephant Siam, hippo bull Knautschke, ten hamadryas baboons, a chimpanzee, and a black stork. After the battle, some animals had escaped, while some of the killed animals were subsequently eaten by Red Army soldiers.

Following the zoo&#x27;s destruction, it and the associated aquarium were reconstructed on modern principles so as to display the animals in as close to their natural environment as then feasible. The success in breeding animals, including some rare species, demonstrates the efficacy of these new methods.

===Postwar period===
The zoo is located in what became West Berlin, hence a second zoo—Tierpark Berlin]]—was built in the East.
There was virtually no public attention paid to the zoo&#x27;s Third Reich history until 2000, when Werner Cohn, whose father was a former shareholder, wrote to enquire about the fate of those shares. The zoo initially denied that Jewish shareholders were forced to sell their shares, but as a public scandal ensued, it ultimately acknowledged this. It commissioned a historian to identify these past shareholders and track down their descendants, according to a report by AFP.

== Zoo ==
The Berlin Zoo is the most visited zoo in Europe, with more than 3.3 million visitors per year from all over the world. It is open all year long and can be reached easily by public transportation. The Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station (also simply known as &quot;Zoo&quot;) is one of Berlin&#x27;s most important stations. Several modes of transport such as U-Bahn, S-Bahn and buses are interlinked here. 

Visitors can either enter the zoo through the exotically designed Elephant Gate beside the aquarium on Budapester Straße or through the Lion Gate on Hardenbergplatz. The original Elephant Gate, built in 1899, was destroyed in World War II. It was faithfully reconstructed to original plans in 1984. 

The zoo has always maintained an extensive and diverse collection. At the outbreak of World War II there were 4000 birds and mammals of 1400 species, while the aquarium held 8300 reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates of 750 species. In 2001, the combined collection numbered 14188 animals of 1517 species, similar to present. The number of larger animals displayed has gradually thinned as enclosures become increasingly designed to recreate natural habitat.

The zoo maintains studbooks for black and Indian rhinoceroses and gaurs. The populations of rare deer and pigs are part of several captive breeding projects. Berlin Zoo supports conservationists in other countries (for instance, in Madagascar) and as a partner of the , a species protection foundation.

The zoo houses four types of great ape: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos.

The carnivore house displays all big cats and many rare small predators, such as ring-tailed mongooses and narrow-striped mongooses from Madagascar. In the basement, visitors are invited to a view into the world of nocturnal animals.

The bird house presents a walk-through aviary and offers a broad variety of forms, including several regularly breeding species of hornbills and many parrots. Numerous big aviaries show waders, herons and many other species. The Berlin Zoo is one of the few zoos to exhibit tuatara (in the aquarium) and Luzon tarictic hornbills.

== Aquarium ==
The aquarium was built in 1913 as part of the Zoologischer Garten complex. In addition to fish and other aquatic life, it is home to most of the zoo&#x27;s reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.

== Animals ==

Polar bear Knut was born in captivity at the zoo on 5 December 2006. He and his twin brother or sister were directly rejected by their mother on the day of birth. He was subsequently raised by zookeeper Thomas Dörflein and became the center of a mass media phenomenon that spanned the globe, quickly spawning numerous toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. Zoo attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30%, making it the most profitable year in its 165-year history. Knut died on 19 March 2011 after collapsing in his exhibit.

Bao Bao (1978–2012) was one of the first two giant pandas in Germany and became – for a time – the oldest known panda in zoos. He was together with the female panda Tjen Tjen (who died in 1984) given to West Germany by China in 1980. Between 1991 and 1993 Bao Bao was loaned to London Zoo. In 1995, back in his Berlin home, another female named Yan Yan was sent on loan from China in an attempt to mate Bao Bao. In spite of several artificial insemination experiments there were no offspring. Yan Yan died in 2007. In summer 2017, giant pandas returned to Berlin, when Jiao Quing and Meng Meng arrived on breeding loan from China. In September 2019, Meng Meng gave birth to twin male panda cubs, Pit und Paule. On 22 August 2024, Meng Meng gave again birth to twin panda cubs, this time two females. 

Fatou the female gorilla was born on 13 April 1957. She came to the zoo at an estimated age of two. In 1974 she gave birth to the first gorilla to be raised in Berlin, Dufte. Since the death of Colo in January 2017, she is the oldest living gorilla in captivity of the world (now together with American gorilla Trudy).

==Incidents / Criticism==
In 2008, Claudia Hämmerling, a Green Party MP, accused the zoo director, Bernhard Blaszkiewitz (also the director of Tierpark Berlin), of selling hundreds of animals for slaughter, in some cases to breeders in China for potency-boosting drugs. The same year, Blaszkiewitz admitted to breaking the necks of several feral domestic housecat kittens found at the zoo. 

In 2009, a woman was mauled by polar bears after jumping into their exhibit. She was rushed to the hospital and survived.

In 2023, employees from the zoo&#x27;s education department made serious allegations of exploitation and disrespect. They also criticised the fact that quality in the area of education was no longer a priority, although this is one of the main tasks of a scientifically working zoo. These accusations highlighted problems within the organisation and led to a wave of terminations by the zoo and resignations from dissatisfied employees. As a result, the original team was reduced to around a third of its previous size. These staffing shortages forced the management to limit the offers of guided tours.

<doc id="1005901" wikidata="Q313514" url="?curid=1005901" title="Joe Flanigan">
<text>Joe Flanigan (born January 5, 1967) is an American writer and actor best known for his portrayal of the character Major/Lt. Colonel John Sheppard in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.

==Early life==
Flanigan was born Joseph Dunnigan III in Los Angeles. He has said that his mother, Nancy, left his father soon after he was born and that his surname was changed to Flanigan after he was adopted by his stepfather, business executive John Flanigan. When he was six years old, his family moved to a small ranch near Reno, Nevada.

From the age of 14, Flanigan attended a boarding school in Ojai, California, where he appeared in the school production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. He later earned a history degree at the University of Colorado where he appeared in the play &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. On the advice of a friend, he took acting classes to overcome his shyness but did not plan to pursue a career in acting. As part of the Junior Year Abroad program, Flanigan spent a year studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he learned French.

==Career==
After graduation, he pursued a writing career. He worked on Capitol Hill on President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s advance team. and then briefly for several New York City publications, including &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; and &quot;Interview&quot; magazine. On the advice of some of his friends, he studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse, was coached by Gerald Gordon, and then moved back to Los Angeles in 1994 to pursue an acting career.

Flanigan had guest roles in numerous television series including &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;First Monday&quot;, and &quot;Sisters&quot;, until he got his breakthrough with his role on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; as Lt. Colonel John Sheppard. He lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where the series was filmed during the week, and flew to Los Angeles during the weekends where his wife and children resided. He additionally wrote for the series and created the stories for the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; second season episode &quot;Epiphany&quot; and the fourth season episode &quot;Outcast&quot;.

In September 2007, SciFi.com&#x27;s SciFi Wire service reported that, &quot;Talent agency UTA filed suit on Sept. 24 against Stargate Atlantis star Joe Flanigan in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming that the actor owes $99,225 in commissions, according to The Hollywood Reporter; Flanigan&#x27;s manager, John Carrabino, told the trade paper about the lawsuit: &#x27;I had no idea they did this. This is the first time I&#x27;m hearing about this.&#x27;&quot; UTA filed a similar lawsuit against actor Wesley Snipes, who was equally surprised. This suit was settled in December 2008.

Flanigan appears in Brooks Institute photographer John A. Russo&#x27;s book &quot;About Face&quot;. Part of the proceeds are to be donated to Smile Train.

In 2019, Flanigan joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; as recurring character Dr. Neil Byrne.

==In contemporary culture==

Flanigan is featured in the contemporary public artwork, &quot;Metascifi&quot; (2015) by artist Martin Firrell. &quot;Metascifi&quot; presents social commentary and philosophical truths about living well, derived from observations of popular American science fiction television series. The project features performers and characters from &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Farscape&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;.

As the &#x27;meta&#x27; element of the title suggests, the artwork invites Flanigan to comment on the wider social and narrative significance of his &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; character John Sheppard. Most notably, he speaks about the sexual attraction of the archetypal action hero, suggesting it is the impression of the hero&#x27;s agency in the world that underpins people&#x27;s attraction to characters of John Sheppard&#x27;s nature.

==Personal life==
Flanigan married Katherine Kousi, an actress and painter, in 1996. They have three sons. In early 2014, it was announced they had separated.

Flanigan took two prizes in the Waterkeepers&#x27; Alliance downhill skiing competition at Lake Louise in January 2006, an event fellow Stargate lead Richard Dean Anderson has attended as well. He currently resides in Malibu, California. 
On November 10, 2018, the Malibu home he was renting from a local family was lost in the Woolsey Fire.

<doc id="1005909" wikidata="Q2525726" url="?curid=1005909" title="Bill Tytla">
<text>Vladimir Peter &quot;Bill&quot; Tytla (October 25, 1904 - December 30, 1968) was a Ukrainian-American animator known for his work in Walt Disney Animation Studios, Paramount&#x27;s Famous Studios, and Terrytoons. In his Disney career, Tytla is particularly noted for the animation in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; (&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria&quot; Segments) and &quot;Dumbo&quot;. He was inducted as a Disney Legend in 1998.

He was also known as the creator of Little Audrey for Paramount Pictures.

==Early years==
Vladimir Peter Tytla was born on October 25, 1904, in Yonkers, New York. His Ukrainian immigrant parents reportedly recognized talent in their son and encouraged it. In 1914, when Tytla was 9, he visited Manhattan to attend &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;, an animated vaudeville act by Winsor McCay. He never forgot it, and some say it changed his life forever.

Tytla attended the New York Evening School of Industrial Design while still in high school. But eventually high school lost out to his interest in art and he quit. In 1920, at age 16, Tytla was working for the Paramount animation studio in New York. His assignment was providing lettering for title cards. He was nicknamed &quot;Tytla the Titler.&quot;

His first animation experiences were on &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; short films at the Bronx studio of Raoul Barré and the &quot;Joy and Bloom Phable&quot; at the Greenwich Village studio of John Terry, later creator of the aviation comic strip Scorchy Smith. His brother Paul Terry, founder of Terrytoons, soon hired Tytla to work on his Aesop&#x27;s Fables.

Within three years he was earning a very good salary as an animator and supporting his family. The simplistic nature of cartoons at the time did not challenge Tytla who dreamed of becoming a fine artist. He took up his studies again at the Art Students League of New York and studied under Boardman Robinson.

In 1929, he sailed for Europe with some of his school friends to study painting in Paris. There he not only studied painting, but sculpture with Charles Despiau. To this has been attributed the weight and three-dimensionality of his work. In Europe he was able to see first hand the masterpieces he had only read about. True to his nature of never wanting to be second best, Tytla came to the conclusion that he could never top these masters and destroyed most of his work.

==Back in America==
Tytla returned to the United States with the attitude that he could become a great master of animation by incorporating his rich knowledge of art. Now animated shorts had sound which in turn brought a new enthusiasm and a need for talented animators. Paul Terry offered Bill a job right away. There he met animator Art Babbitt, who became his close friend and roommate. Art eventually left to work for Walt Disney because of the challenging work and good working conditions. For two years Art tried to entice Bill to come out to Hollywood, but Bill did not want to leave his family and a well-paying job during the Great Depression. Finally in 1934 Tytla flew to Hollywood. He was very impressed and accepted the job even at a lower salary than he was being paid at Terrytoons.

During his &quot;probationary&quot; year in 1935 Tytla worked on three shorts:

*&quot;The Cookie Carnival&quot;, a Silly Symphonies short, first released on May 25, 1935.
*&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot;, a cartoon featuring firefighters Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck attempting to rescue Clarabelle Cow from a burning boarding house. First released on August 3, 1935.
*&quot;Cock o&#x27; the Walk&quot;, a Silly Symphonies short, first released on November 30, 1935.

Tytla in &quot;The Cookie Carnival&quot; was responsible for animating the gingerbread boy and girl as well as the rivalry between the angel-food and devil&#x27;s food cakes. He animated the broadly comic Clarabelle Cow in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot;. In &quot;Cock o&#x27; the Walk&quot;, Tytla animated his first &quot;heavy,&quot; a bully rooster dancing the Carioca. Grim Natwick, creator of Betty Boop, remarked, &quot;Bill hovered over his drawing board like a giant vulture protecting a nest filled with golden eggs, he was an intense worker—eager, nervous, absorbed... Key drawings were whittled out with impassioned pencil thrusts that tore holes in the animation paper.&quot;

His work did not go unnoticed by Walt Disney who soon came to realize what he had in Tytla. Consequently, both his responsibilities and his wages increased dramatically. Tytla and Babbitt quickly became two of Disney&#x27;s top-salaried artists, and again shared a residence—this time a Tuxedo Terrace house complete with a maid. He continued to send money home and purchased for his family 150 acre (607,000 m2) of farmland in East Lyme, Connecticut. Babbitt started after hours &quot;Action Analysis&quot; classes and brought in Don Graham to teach. Tytla was an eager participator in these classes (later to become officially sanctioned by Disney) which have been credited with some of the phenomenal leaps in the quality of animation during this period.

Tytla was one of the first animators assigned to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Fred Moore and Tytla were responsible for much of the design of the film and the definition of the personalities of the seven dwarfs. One of Tytla&#x27;s famous scenes from the film (as described by John Canemaker) is where woman-hating Grumpy is kissed by Snow White. As he brusquely walks away, an internal warmth generated by the kiss gradually slows him, bringing a soft smile and sigh to his lips, revealing his true feelings of love. Grumpy&#x27;s inner feelings are portrayed solely through pantomime—in his telling facial expressions, his body language, and the timing of his reactions.

==Marriage==
One evening of 1936 in the art classes of Don Graham, a vibrant and beautiful 22-year-old actress and fashion model from Seattle named Adrienne le Clerc posed for the animators, including Tytla. She shared his volcanic temperament, but admitted &quot;My glass was half-filled with enthusiasm, his often half-empty with self-doubts. We were, however, definitely yin and yang&quot;. Their thirty-year marriage began on April 21, 1938.

Clearly, she was a great inspiration and support for her husband although she complained that to get her husband&#x27;s attention when he was intently working on his animation, she had to stand in the doorway naked.

==Continued Disney career== 
&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was eventually completed and premiered and released on December 21, 1937. Tytla was next assigned to animate Stromboli, an explosive puppeteer and kidnapper in &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. &quot;Bill was powerful, muscular, high-strung and sensitive, with a tremendous ego,&quot; wrote Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in their book &quot;The Disney Villain&quot;. &quot;Everything was &#x27;feelings&#x27; with Bill. Whatever he animated had the inner feelings of his characters expressed through very strong acting. He did not just get inside Stromboli, he was Stromboli and he lived that part.&quot; Animator T. Hee saw Tytla so wrapped up in his work, that he quietly scurried out of the room.

&quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; was a 1938 short featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Tytla animated the giant who was as dumb as he was huge. The character &quot;became the model for all giants throughout the industry from gags to personality,&quot; according to Johnston and Thomas. The short was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film of 1939. But it lost to &quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot;, another Disney short, directed by Dick Rickard, animated by Milt Kahl and Ward Kimball.

Early in 1938, Tytla animated Yen Sid, the old magician in &quot;&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, which would eventually become a segment in &quot;Fantasia&quot;. However the character from &quot;Fantasia&quot; which Tytla is better known for is Chernabog, his own version of Crnobog the Black God, from the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;/&quot;Ave Maria&quot;&quot; sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had a pretty good idea of what he wanted to do and did not like Bela&#x27;s interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.

Not one to want to be typecast as an animator who only worked the strongest characters, Tytla requested as his next assignment &quot;Dumbo&quot;, the baby elephant ridiculed and rejected because of his big ears. This time his reference was his own infant son, Peter. The intent was to do something nontheatrical and sincere, to try to put the personality of a human child into that of an elephant so that it rings true. His son, Peter Tytla, has grown up to become a collage artist focusing on images made from photographs of junk cars.

==The strike==
While &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was hugely successful the following films had a hard time making money due to the war in Europe cutting of nearly 50% of their revenue. This led to staff layoff and broken promises with regard to job security, raises and bonuses.

While the top animators like Tytla and Babbitt were highly paid, they were all too aware of the low wages being paid to assistants and Film production people. Babbitt even went as far as paying his assistant out of his own pocket. But in early 1941, Babbitt was fired for union activities. The day after Babbitt led over 300 Disney studio employees in a strike, demanding union representation. To Disney&#x27;s surprise and dismay, Tytla joined the strike line. &quot;I was for the company union, and I went on strike because my friends were on strike,&quot; said Tytla. &quot;I was sympathetic with their views, but I never wanted to do anything against Walt.&quot; The strike lasted over two months and was so divisive that it profoundly altered the course of American character animation. As the strike ended, America entered World War II and the Golden age was effectively over.

Tytla returned to the studio, but &quot;there was too much tension and electricity in the air,&quot; according to Adrianne Tytla. With Vladimir, &quot;everything was instinctive and intuitive, and now the vibes were all wrong.&quot; Due to the economics of the studio at the time, assignments were less challenging. In &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; Tytla animated Pedro (a baby airplane) and Jose Carioca (a Brazilian parrot). His small and final portrayals at Disney were a witch and a Nazi teacher in the short &quot;Education for Death&quot; and the climactic battle between a giant octopus and an American eagle in the feature &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;. Tytla&#x27;s perception that he was unwelcome at the studio, less challenging work, his wife&#x27;s three-year-long illness with tuberculosis, fear of Japanese attack, and a desire to live on his Connecticut farm eventually led him to the decision to leave the studio. He resigned from the Disney studio on February 24, 1943, an action he regretted for the remainder of his life.

== Work at Terrytoons and Famous Studios==
After leaving the Disney studio Tytla returned to Terrytoons for a short while. There he was assigned as a film director for the short &quot;The Sultan&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1944). Tytla soon left Terrytoons but would continue to act as a director for the rest of his animation career.

His next employer was Famous Studios, owned by Paramount Pictures. His directorial efforts there include several shorts:

*Starring Little Lulu.
**&quot;Snap Happy&quot; (June 22, 1945).
**&quot;Bored of Education&quot; (March 1, 1946).

**&quot;Hector&#x27;s Hectic Life&quot; (November 19, 1948).
**&quot;Campus Capers featuring Herman&quot; (July 1, 1949)

His own daughter Tammy reportedly provided inspiration for the Little Lulu and Little Audrey shorts. She would later pursue a career as an artist and photographer, known as Tamara Schacher-Tytla.

== Work at Tempo Productions ==
Tytla left Famous Studios during the early 1950s to work for Tempo Productions. Tempo was founded in 1946 as a partnership between David Hilberman and Zack Schwartz. They were both former Disney colleagues of Tytla. David had notably served as an art director for &quot;Bambi&quot; and Zack for &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. They were among the founders of the United Productions of America but later sold their shares to their partner Stephen Bosustow.

At first the two intended to produce educational films but soon found there was only a limited market for them. However Jack Zander, head of the animation department of Transfilm Inc., which produced television commercials, approached them with an offer to produce animated advertisements for his company. They were at first assigned to advertise Camel cigarettes. Later their assignments included Standard Brands, Plymouth automobile, National Dairy Association, Tide and Clark Gum Company. Zack Schwartz had left the company in 1948/1949 but assignments continued. David Hilberman decided to expand the staff. The expansion included hiring Tytla as advertisement director.

The squared-off stylized designs reportedly frustrated Tytla. But he produced some good work there including some stop motion animation. His animated advertisements though are perhaps the least well-remembered part of his career. When the revival of interest in classical animation started in the 1980s, they were long unavailable to audiences, presumably lost. A reason for this was that Tempo proved short-lived, blacklisted during the Red Scare of the early 1950s.

Tytla, however took time to visit his former colleagues at Disney in 1954. Unlike Babbitt he was welcome to do so and even had his picture taken with his old boss Walt. In a letter to Marc Davis written in December 1954 Tytla said &quot;What a helluva swell time I had, It did me a world of good&quot;.

== Later years ==
His next sources of employment were animated series. He is credited as director for episodes of four different series:
*&quot;Popeye&quot; (September 10, 1956 –September 28, 1963).
*&quot;Deputy Dawg&quot; (September 5, 1959 – 1972).
* &quot;Matty&#x27;s Funday Funnies&quot; (featuring Beany and Cecil by Bob Clampett, October 11, 1959 – 1962).
* &quot;The New Casper Cartoon Show&quot; (1963–1969).

He also took time to create one last short for Terrytoons, &quot;First Flight Up&quot; (1962). His last work of animation on a film was for Warner Bros. Cartoons on &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot;, a comedy feature film mixing live action and animation, directed by Arthur Lubin and starring Don Knotts as a fish. However, during this time Tytla became ill and a lot of the actual animation was completed by animation director Robert McKimson, Hawley Pratt and Gerry Chiniquy. All three of them are better known for their Looney Tunes work. Tytla had also been working on the idea for an animated movie called &quot;Mousthusula, the 2000 Year Old Mouse&quot;, but couldn&#x27;t find anyone being interested.

Following this Tytla suffered many small strokes which left him blind in his left eye. On August 13, 1967, the opening night of the Montreal Expo&#x27;s World Exhibition of Animation Cinema, featured a screening of &quot;Dumbo&quot; as part of an &quot;Hommage Aux Pionniers&quot;. Tytla was invited, but worried if anyone would remember him. When the film finished, they announced the presence of &quot;The Great Animator.&quot; When the spotlight finally found him, the audience erupted in &quot;a huge outpouring of love. It may have been one of the great moments of his life,&quot; recalled animation historian John Culhane.

In a letter dated August 27, 1968, W.H. Anderson, then-Vice President of Walt Disney Productions, rejected Tytla&#x27;s offer to do &quot;trial animation&quot;, saying, &quot;We really have only enough animation for our present staff.&quot; And as late as October 11, 1968, less than three months before Tytla&#x27;s death, Disney director Wolfgang Reitherman responded to story material Tytla submitted explaining &quot;...I&#x27;m sorry to say that your story ideas don&#x27;t fit into our present program.. We have not forgotten that you are anxious to animate here at the studio, but ... So far, we can just barely keep our present crew of animators busy ... rest assured you have many friends here at the studio who are pulling for you.&quot;

After briefly working at Hanna-Barbera, and directing The Lone Ranger cartoon for Format Films, Vladimir Tytla died on his farm on December 30, 1968, aged 64. He was an atheist.

<text>Kennedy Mall is a shopping mall located in Dubuque, Iowa. It is owned by the Cafaro Company. The mall&#x27;s anchor stores are Edward Jones, Shoe Carnival, Planet Fitness, Vertical Jump Park, JCPenney, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Ulta Beauty, and Books-A-Million.

=== Anchors ===
* Best Buy
* Books-A-Million ()
* Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods
* JCPenney ()
* Planet Fitness
* Shoe Carnival
* Ulta Beauty
* Vertical Jump Park

==History==

=== 20th century ===
In 1964, Montgomery Ward announced that it would move its store in Dubuque, which was located in the downtown area, out to the west end. In February 1966, rezoning of the land on which the mall was built was approved. William M. Cafaro and Associates (now Cafaro Company) of Youngstown, Ohio developed the site. The mall was completed in 1968.

In 1968, Younkers was opened as the Kennedy Mall&#x27;s first store. This was followed by Montgomery Ward in May 1969, and Roshek&#x27;s in the fall of 1970. The mall was formally opened on April 15, 1970, with F. W. Woolworth Company operating as a junior anchor. At the time, it had sixty stores, which made it Iowa&#x27;s largest enclosed mall. Soon afterward, a tornado had damaged the Dubuque area, including the mall.

In the 1980s, JCPenney, Younkers, Sears, and Armstrong&#x27;s would move into the Kennedy Mall. A number of renovations were made to the mall in 1989. This included opening up a food court at the northeast corner of the mall and a number of cosmetic improvements to the mall. Also, a space for Sears was carved out of the Armstrong Department store.

Originally, there was a General Cinema movie theater with a single 795-seat auditorium located within the mall. In 1972, it was remodeled into a two-screen theater with about 300 seats in each auditorium. In the 1980s, General Cinema built a new six-screen theater named Kennedy Mall Cinema 6 in the parking lot just west of the mall to replace the theater inside the mall.

=== 21st century ===
On January 21, 2014, it was announced that Sears would be closing in late April. Vertical Jump Park opened in 2016. Mindframe Theaters closed down January 1, 2017 and was replaced with Michigan-based Phoenix Theatres. In 2018, the Younkers closed, affecting ninety employees.

In early 2020, Kennedy Mall partnered with Carnegie-Stout Public Library to open the Reading Corner, a community reading space inside the mall. The space closed during COVID-19 pandemic and was later displaced by a retail store, but was reopened in February 2024. In February 2023, it was announced that Books-A-Million would be moving into half of the former Younkers store. A HomeGoods took over the book store and a few other empty store fronts inside the mall. In June 2024, the mall requested zoning modifications to allow for businesses to be built in the southwestern parking lot.

<doc id="1005919" wikidata="Q731947" url="?curid=1005919" title="Fongafale">
<text>Fongafale (also spelled Fogale or Fagafale) is the largest and most populated of Funafuti&#x27;s islets in Tuvalu. It is a long narrow sliver of land, 12 kilometres long and between 10 and 400 metres wide, with the South Pacific Ocean and reef on the east and the protected lagoon on the west. The north part is the Tengako peninsula, and Funafuti International Airport runs from northeast to southwest on the widest part of the island, with the village and administrative centre of Vaiaku on the lagoon side. 

On Fongafale, the Funafuti Kaupule is responsible for approval of the construction of houses or extensions to existing buildings on private land, and the Lands Management Committee is the responsible authority in relation to lands leased by government.

In 1972, Funafuti was in the path of Cyclone Bebe. Cyclone Bebe knocked down 90% of the houses and trees on Fongafale. The storm surge created a wall of coral rubble along the ocean side of Fongafale and Funafala that was about long, and about to thick at the bottom.

==Villages on Fongafale==
Fogafale islet is the location of the main village settlements of Lofeagai, Teone, Fakai Fou, Senala, Alapi, Vaiaku and Kavatoetoe, from the northern to the southern point of the islet respectively which appear as one contiguous urban area.

Vaiaku is the most important neighbourhood; it includes Funafuti Lagoon Hotel, some shops, a fuel pump station, the general post office, and the National Bank of Tuvalu, the nation&#x27;s only commercial bank. The villages have a surface area of more than 0.65 square kilometres and approximately 4,000 inhabitants.

==Parliament of Tuvalu and government buildings==
The Parliament of Tuvalu or &quot;Palamene o Tuvalu&quot; and the house of the Governor General of Tuvalu are located on Fongafale. Buildings include the offices of the government ministries and the government agencies, such as the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, the Tuvalu Meteorological Service, the National Bank of Tuvalu, the offices of the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, and the Tuvalu National Library and Archives. The Tuvalu Media Department, which operates radio services as &quot;Radio Tuvalu&quot;, is also located on Fongafale.

==Other buildingg==

The police service has its headquarters and the jail on Fongafale. The High Court of Tuvalu is also located on Fongafale. Princess Margaret Hospital, the only hospital in Tuvalu, is located on Fongafale. Other significant buildings located on Fongafale are the Rt Hon Sir Dr Tomasi Puapua Convention Center, &quot;Tausoa&quot; &quot;Maneapa&quot; (community hall), &quot;Fetu Ao Lima&quot; (Morning Star Church) of the Church of Tuvalu and the Teone Church of the Roman Catholic Mission sui iuris of Funafuti.

==Transportation==

===Air===
Tuvalu&#x27;s only airport, Funafuti International Airport, is located here. All connections are to Suva, Fiji via Fiji Airways.

===Land===
There are four taxis, and motorbikes are available for hire.

===Water===
Access to the Funafuti Conservation Area is by boat. The Conservation Area is across the lagoon from the main island of Fongafale.

There are port facilities on Fongafale. Two passenger/cargo ships, &quot;Nivaga II&quot; and &quot;Manu Folau&quot;, provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks, and also travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti 3 to 4 times a year.

==Aquifer salinization of Fongafale==
The investigation of groundwater dynamics of Fongafale Islet, Funafuti, show that tidal forcing results in salt water contamination of the surficial aquifer during spring tides. The degree of aquifer salinization depends on the specific topographic characteristics and the hydrologic controls in the sub-surface of the atoll. About half of Fongafale islet is reclaimed swamp that contains porous, highly permeable coral blocks that allow the tidal forcing of salt water.

During World War II the occupying Japanese conducted extensive swamp reclamation to create an air field. It has been adapted as the Funafuti International Airport. As a consequence of the specific topographic characteristics of Fongafale, unlike other atoll islands of a similar size, Fongafale does not have a thick freshwater lens. The narrow fresh water and brackish water sheets in the sub-surface of Fongafale islet results in the taro swamps and the fresh groundwater resources of the islet being highly vulnerable to salinization resulting from the rising sea level.

A survey of the pits that have previously been used to grow Swamp taro (&quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot;), (known in Tuvalu as &quot;Pulaka&quot;) established that the pits were either too saline or very marginal for swamp taro production, even though a more salt-tolerant species of taro (&quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot;) is grown on Fongafale.

==Over-extraction of groundwater and pollution==
In addition to the increased risk of salinization by the sea-level rise, the freshwater lens is at risk from over extraction to serve the large population that now occupies Fongafale islet. The effects of the increased extraction can be exacerbated by a decrease of the rainfall recharge rate associated with climate change. Water pollution is a chronic problem, with domestic wastewater identified as the primary pollution source. Approximately 92% of households on Fongafale islet have access to septic tanks and pit toilets. However, these sanitary facilities are not built per the design specifications, or they are not suitable for the geophysical characteristics, which results in seepage into the fresh water lens and run-off into coastal waters.

A project involving the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) is constructing composting toilets and improving the treatment of sewage sludge from septic tanks on Fongafale in order to reduce the leakage from septic tanks into groundwater, and the ocean and lagoon.

In November 2013 the World Bank announced US$6 million in funding to improve the operational safety of the Funafuti International Airport and associated infrastructure. An 800,000-litre water cistern will be constructed to improve storage of drinking water.

==Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project==
When the airfield, which is now Funafuti International Airport, was constructed during World War II, the coral base of the atoll was withdrawn to use as fill to create the runway. The resulting borrow pits adversely affected the fresh-water aquifer. In the low areas of Funafuti, the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide. 

Since 1994 a project has been in development to assess the environmental impact of transporting sand from the lagoon to fill all the borrow pits and low-lying areas on Fongafale. In 2013 a feasibility study was carried out and in 2014 the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project was approved. It will result in all 10 borrow pits being filled, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond.

The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project. The project was carried out in 2015, with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and ultimately improve water and living conditions on the island. This project increase the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent.

==Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project==
Tuvalu has received funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to develop the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP) which has the overall objective of reducing the vulnerability of Tuvalu to the impacts of coastal hazards associated with climate change. The TCAP is a plan to construct hard and soft coastal protection infrastructure to reduce inundation and coastal erosion on the islands of Nanumaga, Nanumea and Funafuti. The implementation of the TCAP on Funafuti is proposed to be a land reclamation project on Fongafale, which will start from the northern boundary of the Queen Elizabeth Park (QEP) reclamation area and extend to the northern Tausoa Beach Groyne and the development of the Catalina Ramp Harbour.

In December 2022, work on the Funafuti reclamation project commenced. The project is to dredge sand from the lagoon, to construct a platform that is meters long and meters wide, giving a total area of approximately 7.8 ha. (19.27 acres), which is designed to remain above sea level rise and the reach of storm waves beyond the year 2100.

<text>John Malcolm McCardell Jr. (born June 17, 1949) is an American historian and academic administrator. He served as the President of Middlebury College from 1992 to 2004 and as the Vice-Chancellor and President of from 2010 to 2020. 

As of 2023, he is a history professor at Sewanee.

==Early life==
McCardell was born on June 17, 1949, in Maryland. He graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1971. He earned a PhD in History from Harvard University in 1976. For his dissertation, &quot;The Idea of a Southern Nation&quot;, he was awarded the 1977 Allan Nevins Prize by the Society of American Historians.

==Academic career==
McCardell joined the History department at Middlebury College in 1976 and was professor there until 2010. He served as the president of the college from 1992 to 2004. An anonymous donor of $50 million in the spring of 2004 asked that Middlebury&#x27;s science center, Bicentennial Hall, be renamed John M. McCardell Jr. Bicentennial Hall. 

McCardell served as Vice-Chancellor of from 2010 until June 17, 2020. As of 2023, he continues as a professor of history at the University.

===Lowering the drinking age===
McCardell is the founder and director of Choose Responsibility, an organization dedicated to exploring and advocating the lowering of the legal drinking age to 18 and issuing drinking learner permits to adults age 18, 19, and 20 in an effort to promote responsible consumption. He authored an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004 saying, &quot;the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law&quot;. He later spearheaded the creation of the Amethyst Initiative, a statement of over 120 college presidents across the United States calling for reconsideration of drinking age laws.

==Personal life==
McCardell has a wife, Bonnie Greenwald, and two sons.

<doc id="1005935" wikidata="Q805397" url="?curid=1005935" title="Ballycastle, County Mayo">
<text>Ballycastle () is a village in County Mayo, Ireland, situated northwest from Ballina, near Mayo&#x27;s north coast. It lies on the edge of the Mayo Gaeltacht.

Ballycastle is situated on the coast of north County Mayo, with its northern boundary exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. To the west of the town are the Stags of Broadhaven, to the east lies Killala Bay while to the south are the towns of Ballina and Crossmolina.

==History==

The Céide Fields, approximately 7 km north of Ballycastle, was where the first settlers began to farm the slopes of the Behy/Glenurla hillside, over 5000 years ago. 

The parish of Ballycastle is a combination of the two ancient parishes of Kilbride and Doonfeeney. The name Ballycastle was in use as early as 1470 and was referred to as a parish in the Catholic directory of 1836.

==Notable people==

Notable people from Ballycastle include the Gaelic footballer Tommy Langan who won two All-Ireland Senior Football Championships for Mayo and was named on the Football Team of the Millennium.

==Transport==
Ballycastle lies at the junction of the R314 and R315 regional roads. Bus Éireann route 445 serves Ballycastle on weekdays to Ballina via Killala.

==Events==
Ballycastle is host to Healyfest, a music event which takes place in a pub in the village on each August Bank Holiday.

<text>In mathematics, a fundamental theorem is a theorem which is considered to be central and conceptually important for some topic. For example, the fundamental theorem of calculus gives the relationship between differential calculus and integral calculus. The names are mostly traditional, so that for example the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is basic to what would now be called number theory. Some of these are classification theorems of objects which are mainly dealt with in the field. For instance, the fundamental theorem of curves describes classification of regular curves in space up to translation and rotation.

Likewise, the mathematical literature sometimes refers to the fundamental lemma of a field. The term lemma is conventionally used to denote a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result, rather than as a useful statement in-and-of itself.

<doc id="1005941" wikidata="Q7799337" url="?curid=1005941" title="Thurlow Weed">
<text>Edward Thurlow Weed (November 15, 1797 – November 22, 1882) was a printer, New York newspaper publisher, and Whig and Republican politician. He was the principal political advisor to prominent New York politician William H. Seward and was instrumental in the presidential nominations of William Henry Harrison (1840), Zachary Taylor (1848), and John C. Frémont (1856).

Born in Cairo, New York, Weed apprenticed as a printer under William Williams and served with him in the War of 1812 before winning election to the New York State Assembly. He met Seward in the assembly, and they formed a close political alliance that lasted for several decades. Weed and Seward became leaders of the New York Anti-Masonic Party, and Weed established the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot; as the party&#x27;s main newspaper. Weed supported the American System of Henry Clay and helped establish the Whig Party in the 1830s. He helped Seward win election as Governor of New York and supported the successful presidential candidacies of Harrison and Taylor.

Weed led New York&#x27;s Whigs for much of the 1830s and 1840s but abandoned the party following the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. He helped organize the Republican Party and supported Frémont&#x27;s nomination at the 1856 Republican National Convention. He led the effort to nominate Seward at the 1860 Republican National Convention, but the convention nominated Abraham Lincoln. After the Civil War, Weed and Seward allied with President Andrew Johnson and supported Johnson&#x27;s approach to Reconstruction. Weed retired from public life in 1867 and died in 1882.

==Early life==
Weed was born on November 15, 1797, in the hamlet of Acra, part of the town of Cairo in Greene County, New York. His father, Joel Weed (1773-1819) and mother Mary (Ellis) Weed (1771-1841) were Connecticut natives who moved to New York to farm, and Weed was the eldest of five siblings, three brothers and two sisters. Neither of his sisters reached adulthood. His brother Orrin was apprenticed to a New York City shipbuilder, Henry Eckford, and died in 1823 during a yellow fever epidemic. His brother Osborn moved to Tennessee, where he was a successful merchant and hotelier before he died in 1851. Weed was christened Edward Thurlow Weed, named for a presumed family connection to Edward Thurlow, England&#x27;s Lord Chancellor. As a boy, Weed dropped his first name; as an adult, he attempted to document the family connection during a visit to England, but was unsuccessful.

Weed&#x27;s father later moved the family to the village of Catskill where he operated a business hauling freight by wagon from the Hudson River docks. Joel Weed&#x27;s business suffered reverses because of his ill health, the sickness of his horses, accidents, and occasional non-payment by his customers, so his family struggled financially. Joel Weed was eventually sentenced to debtors&#x27; prison, but friends and customers signed bonds on his behalf. These guarantees permitted him to take advantage of the &quot;freedom of the prison&quot;, which allowed debtors to travel within permitted limits to earn money to satisfy their obligations, and to spend Sundays with their families. Thurlow Weed received about a year of formal education in Catskill before beginning to work so he could help support his family. At age eight, he was hired to operate a blacksmith&#x27;s bellows for six cents a day. He later worked as an errand boy at a Catskill tavern and hotel, then at a print shop, after which he spent much of his youth working as a cabin boy on boats that traveled the Hudson River.

In 1808, Joel Weed&#x27;s family moved to Cincinnatus, New York, where he worked as a woodcutter, maple syrup maker, and farm laborer with Thurlow&#x27;s assistance. While living in Cincinnatus, Weed attended a local school for a brief period before the family moved again, this time to Onondaga. In both Cincinnatus and Onondaga, Weed worked to improve on his formal education by diligent self-study, sometimes walking several miles to visit neighbors who would allow him to borrow books. In Onondaga, Joel Weed earned a living by cutting wood for a potash maker, again with his son&#x27;s aid. Thurlow Weed later worked at an Onondaga iron forge, where his task was to temper the sand used in casting and molding. During a period when the forge was not in operation, Weed obtained a position as a groomsman and gardener for the Onondaga County Clerk, which included his room and board, as well as the promise of additional schooling. For several months, Weed was able to attend a private academy run by the Reverend Caleb Alexander. When the forge resumed operations, Weed returned to his position there.

==Start of career==
===Printer===
Weed learned in 1810 that Thomas Chittenden Fay intended to start a newspaper in Onondaga, the &quot;Lynx&quot;. Having decided on a career in printing and publishing, Weed and his father convinced Fay to take Weed on as a second apprentice. His first tasks included cutting wood and stoking fires, as well as preparing the sheepskins used in making ink balls. Weed soon began to take on additional responsibilities, including building and maintaining files of newspapers with which the &quot;Lynx&quot; exchanged stories, which enabled Fay to develop a network of affiliated newspapers. In 1812, Fay left the newspaper after a dispute with his creditors; Weed printed a handful of issues to publish advertisements that had already been paid for, after which the &quot;Lynx&quot; became defunct. He then moved to Scipio, where he worked briefly on another newspaper, the &quot;Tocsin&quot;, before it too went out of business. Weed then returned to the forge in Onondaga, the owner of which had received a contract to produce round shot iron cannonballs for use by U.S. forces during the War of 1812. After earning enough money to resume searching for work as a printer, Weed traveled to Utica, where he was employed in the printing shop of Seward &amp; Williams.

===Military service===
In February 1813, Weed was working for and residing in the home of William Williams in Utica, New York. During the War of 1812, he joined a volunteer militia company that Williams commanded as a captain, which responded to threat of a British invasion from Canada, and briefly served near Sackets Harbor. The alarm soon passed, and Weed returned to Utica, where he began work on the &quot;Columbian Gazette&quot;, a newspaper published by Thomas Walker. When the militia again called for recruits to respond to the threat of an invasion from Canada, Weed obtained Walker&#x27;s permission to go, and joined a company in the regiment commanded by Elijah H. Metcalf, which performed duty in and around Sackets Harbor.

When the second alarm passed in October 1813, Weed returned to Utica. He soon left for Albany, where he was employed at Webster &amp; Skinner, book publishers and publishers of the &quot;Albany Gazette&quot;. When his work in Albany ended, Weed lived briefly in Herkimer, then moved to Cooperstown, where he continued to work as a printer. After several months in Cooperstown, he returned to Herkimer to take charge of his former employer&#x27;s business while the owner traveled to Connecticut to attend a political convention.

In October 1814, Weed again joined the militia and was appointed quartermaster sergeant of the 40th Regiment of the New York State Militia under quartermaster officer George Petrie. Weed&#x27;s regiment performed duty in Sackets Harbor, and twice successfully paraded to dissuade British commanders on Lake Ontario from landing troops. In January 1815, Weed&#x27;s regiment was mustered out of the service and he returned to Utica.

===Arrest and trial===
While residing in Cooperstown in July 1814, Weed was one of five men arrested the day after a Sunday evening Methodist religious service and accused of harassing several women who had departed the village by wagon after leaving the church. Newspaper publisher Israel W. Clark posted a bond to secure Weed&#x27;s release, while attorney Ambrose L. Jordan volunteered to act as his counsel. Unbeknownst to Weed, Catherine Ostrander, the daughter of the owners of the Cooperstown rooming house where Weed had been staying, had arranged for his bail and legal representation.

The trial was postponed several times because of events surrounding the war, and took place in early 1815. District attorney Charles P. Kirkland decided to try Weed first, separately from the other defendants. Three of the girls who had been in the wagon denied seeing Weed after the church service. The fourth was Catherine Ostrander, who testified that after leaving the church, she had walked through the village with Weed until they reached the road that led to her home, where she boarded the wagon, after which she had not seen Weed again that night. Jordan opted not to call any witnesses, while Kirkland apologized for not having investigated the story of the initial complainant more fully and offered to dismiss the case. The judge told Jordan he would dismiss the case unless Weed preferred that the jury decide. Wanting his innocence on the record, Weed opted for a jury verdict, and the jurors immediately acquitted him, not even rising from their seats to leave the courtroom for deliberations. The charges against the other defendants were soon dismissed. Weed included the details of his arrest and trial in his autobiography because his political opponents had previously attempted to use it against him. (Weed and Ostrander married in 1818.)

==Continued printing career==

After Weed&#x27;s trial, he again enlisted in the militia, but when news of the passage of the Treaty of Ghent that ended the War of 1812 made its way to central New York, Weed&#x27;s militia company was disbanded. He then traveled to Albany, where he obtained employment running the printing presses for the &quot;Albany Register&quot;, which was published by Henry C. Southwick and edited by his brother Solomon Southwick. In 1816, Weed moved to the &quot;Albany Argus&quot;, published by Jesse Buel, whose lucrative appointment as state printer required him to publish state reports, legislative manuals, and legal notices. The additional responsibility Buel delegated to Weed enabled Weed to more than double his salary, and also kindled an interest in politics, since Weed had to set type for or proofread state documents. Weed began attending sessions of the state legislature, and was an early supporter of DeWitt Clinton.

In early 1817, Weed took advantage of a lull in state printing to travel to New York City, where he obtained employment with the Winkle and Wiley book publishing firm. He then moved to a position with the &quot;Political Register&quot;, which was published by William Cobbett after Cobbett fled England to avoid prosecution for sedition. After leaving Cobbett, Weed worked for several other publishers in New York City, including Jonathan Seymour, James Harper, and William A. Mercien. During his hours away from work, Weed attended the theater frequently and continued to observe political meetings.

In mid-1817, Israel W. Clark, a Cooperstown newspaper editor, purchased the &quot;Albany Register&quot; from Henry C. Southwick and offered Weed the job of press foreman, so Weed returned to Albany. In addition to running the presses, Weed began to try his hand at composing editorials on the political topics of the day; under Clark&#x27;s tutelage, he worked to improve his grammar, spelling, and writing style. Over time, he became adept at composing editorials and articles as he set them in type, rather than first preparing a manuscript, which gave him a competitive advantage by enabling him to publish them more quickly than could rival editors.

In 1818, a group of pro-DeWitt Clinton Democratic-Republican political figures purchased the Norwich newspaper and publishing business of John F. Hubbard. This group, which included James Birdsall and Obadiah German, then sold the works to Weed, who moved to Norwich to publish the &quot;Agriculturist&quot;. Hubbard was later convinced to start a rival paper opposed to Clinton, the &quot;Norwich Journal&quot;. While living in Norwich, Weed also received a state appointment as commissioner to acknowledge the transfer of deeds and other sale documents, and the two to three dollars in fees he received each month enabled him to continue the &quot;Agriculturist&quot; during the earliest days of its existence.

Weed recognized in 1820 that Norwich was not able to support two newspapers, and that the anti-DeWitt Clinton faction of New York&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party was in the ascendancy, so he sold his publishing works that December and returned to Albany. Weed found employment at the &quot;Albany Argus&quot; working on documents produced as part of the state printing contract, but when the state printers, Leake &amp; Cantine, discovered that Weed was a Clinton supporter, they discharged him. He then accepted a job with Solomon Southwick as a subscription salesman for Southwick&#x27;s publications, the &quot;Ploughboy&quot; and the &quot;Christian Visitant&quot;. Weed traveled throughout central and western New York on Southwick&#x27;s behalf in the spring of 1821, but found few new readers willing to sign up to receive Southwick&#x27;s papers. Discovering that the Federalist-leaning &quot;Manlius Times&quot; had gone out of business years previously and its printing press was idle, in June Weed purchased the equipment on credit and began publication of the &quot;Onondaga Republican&quot;.

While living in Manlius, Weed established a close friendship with Addison Gardiner. Gardiner moved to Rochester after attaining admission to the bar in 1822, and suggested to Weed that his prospects might be better there than in Manlius. Weed decided to relocate again, and closed down the &quot;Republican&quot;. Upon arriving in Rochester, he obtained employment with Everard Peck, the editor of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, the city&#x27;s pro-DeWitt Clinton newspaper, who decided to publish a long-delayed book as a way to provide Weed with temporary employment. Immediately impressed with Weed&#x27;s talents, Peck hired him to run the day-to-day operations of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;. In addition to managing the paper during the day, Weed composed its editorial content at night, and soon established the Telegraph as an important pro-Clinton outlet in central and western New York.

In 1843, Weed, his son James, and John D. Parsons co-founded Albany&#x27;s Weed, Parsons &amp; Company, which became a successful book publisher.

In 1824, Weed was a strong backer of the presidential bid of John Quincy Adams; the &quot;Rochester Telegraph&quot; announced its support in early 1823, and carried his name on the masthead throughout 1823 and 1824. Appointed by Rochester&#x27;s business leaders as their agent for obtaining a charter for a Rochester-based bank, Weed attended all three sessions of the legislature in 1824, and succeeded in obtaining approval for the Bank of Rochester. Nominated by Monroe County&#x27;s Adams supporters, Weed was a candidate for the New York State Assembly. He won his race by a significant margin and represented Monroe County in 1825&#x27;s 48th New York State Legislature. While serving in the Assembly, he befriended William H. Seward, whose legal and political careers were just beginning.

In 1825, Weed bought the &quot;Rochester&quot; &quot;Telegraph&quot;. During 1827, he became involved in the controversy surrounding the disappearance of William Morgan, a former Mason who had threatened to publish a book revealing the secrets of Masonic rituals and degree ceremonies. Weed recognized an opportunity to harness sentiment against the Masons and use it to oppose the policies of Democrat Andrew Jackson at the national level, and the Albany Regency of Martin Van Buren at the state level. He was an organizer of the Anti-Masonic Party, and used the pages of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; to keep Morgan&#x27;s disappearance in the news. Morgan was presumed to have been carried away by Masons and drowned in the Niagara River. When a body washed ashore in September 1827, many Upstate New York residents assumed it was Morgan&#x27;s. Though it was positively identified as Canadian Timothy Munro (or Munroe) by his wife, many Anti-Masons persisted in believing it was Morgan&#x27;s. Weed was alleged to have said the body was a &quot;good enough Morgan&quot; to stoke the controversy until after the upcoming election, a remark Weed denied making. Though the party&#x27;s 1828 candidate for governor of New York, Solomon Southwick, was defeated, Weed and other organizers succeeded in making it the main opposition to the Democratic Party, and experienced electoral success in several northern states, including Vermont and Pennsylvania.

In 1828, Masons succeeded in forcing Weed out of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;. In 1829, he was again elected to the Assembly from Monroe County, this time as an Anti-Mason. He served a one-year term in 1830, which included the sessions of the 53rd New York State Legislature. He also started the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot;. The &quot;Evening Journal&quot; became the largest Anti-Masonic newspaper; Weed was editor, chief reporter, proofreader, and political expert.

In 1832, Weed supported Adams&#x27;s ally Henry Clay, who ran for president as the candidate of the National Republican Party. He was a strong advocate of Clay&#x27;s &quot;American System&quot; for economic development, including a national bank, &quot;internal improvements&quot; such as roads and railroads, and a protective tariff.

By 1834, the Adams-Clay organization that had been the National Republicans was forming into the Whig Party. Most Anti-Masons joined the Whigs, regarding the new party as the best alternative to Jackson and Van Buren, and enabling Weed to assume a leadership role in a larger and more orthodox political organization. His &quot;Evening Journal&quot; became the main Whig newspaper, and by the 1840s it had the largest circulation of any political newspaper in the United States.

Weed and other Whigs worked to blame Van Buren and the Democratic Party for the Panic of 1837. In 1838, he was one of William H. Seward&#x27;s main supporters in Seward&#x27;s successful campaign for governor, and was largely credited with Seward&#x27;s victory. Weed was also a main supporter of William Henry Harrison&#x27;s successful presidential bid in 1840, in which Harrison defeated Van Buren to become the first Whig president.

In the 1830s and 1840s, Weed became active in the abolitionist movement. When former slave Stephen Myers of Albany began creation of a transportation network and system of safe houses for escaping slaves, Weed was among the prominent individuals to whom he turned for financing. In addition, Weed and his wife made their own home available to fleeing slaves as part of the Underground Railroad.

==Political organizer==
Weed was generally seen as the &quot;boss&quot; of New York&#x27;s Whig Party, using the same tactics as the Regency—patronage and political favors—to attract supporters and keep order in the ranks, efforts he was able to reinforce through the &quot;Evening Journal&quot;. Under Weed&#x27;s leadership, the Whigs became the dominant force in state politics for several years, and Weed was arguably the most powerful politician in New York.

As a practical politician, Weed was a pragmatist, rather than an idealist, always taking care to avoid controversial issues and positions that would decrease Whig support on election day. One exception was the issue of slavery, a subject on which Weed made public statements in opposition while trying to avoid the most radical language of those seen as uncompromising abolitionists.

Harrison died in April 1841, only a month after taking office, and was succeeded by John Tyler, a former Democrat, who disappointed Weed by abandoning Whig policies. Weed backed Clay in 1844, but his frustration continued when Clay was narrowly defeated. Following the Mexican–American War, Zachary Taylor emerged as a likely Whig candidate for president, and Weed supported his successful effort. But Taylor, like Harrison, died in office.

Weed played a leading role in the passage of New York&#x27;s Consolidation Act, which created the New York Central Railroad, at the time the largest corporation in the United States. Weed&#x27;s role was noteworthy in that he worked for approval of the Consolidation Act largely as a favor to his friend Erastus Corning, one of the financial backers of the project, though Corning was a Democrat and opposed to Weed politically.

Weed used his political influence to effect improvements and reforms in New York City. In 1847, he was largely responsible for the designation of Castle Garden as the main depot for arriving immigrants and the passage of laws to protect them as they entered the United States. His efforts in the mid-1850s led to the creation of the New York Harbor Commission, a state panel that sought to improve commerce by recommending enhancements to New York City&#x27;s waterways. When construction of Central Park commenced in 1855, Weed played a major role in the selection of the first park commission. As movements for prison reform and reform of charitable services provided by government grew in the mid-19th Century, Weed was largely responsible for the appointment of a non-partisan Board of Charities and Correction for New York City. Weed also influenced efforts to reform the New York City Police Department, including creation of the Board of Police Commissioners.

==1852 campaign==
In 1852, the leading Whig candidates for president were incumbent Millard Fillmore, Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and General Winfield Scott. Fillmore, a former Weed protégé, had succeeded to the presidency after the death of Zachary Taylor and rejected Weed&#x27;s influence. As a result, Weed refused to support him for election to a full term and instead backed Scott. Seward, long a Fillmore rival, also decided to back Scott. Weed concluded during the campaign that support for the unpopular Compromise of 1850 meant the Whig Party was on the verge of disintegrating and destined to lose, so he ensured he would not be blamed by taking an extended trip to Europe, visiting England, France, and Germany among other places. He remained abroad for over a year—well after the November 1852 election, which was won by Democrat Franklin Pierce.

==Republican Party leader==
===Founder===
When Weed returned to the United States, the Whig Party had splintered over the Kansas–Nebraska Act, with southern Whigs leaving the party to join the Democrats, and northern Whigs including Seward, forming the Republican Party as an anti-slavery party and the main opposition to the Democrats. Weed joined the Republicans, and the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; became a leading Republican newspaper. Weed supported Seward&#x27;s re-election to the Senate in 1854, and the Republican presidential nomination of John C. Frémont in 1856. Frémont narrowly lost the 1856 election to Democrat James Buchanan.

===1860 election===
Buchanan&#x27;s failed administration and the fracturing of the Democrats over the slavery issue made likely a Republican victory in 1860. Weed worked for Seward&#x27;s nomination at the 1860 Republican National Convention, which appeared to most observers to be a foregone conclusion. But Seward&#x27;s strong anti-slavery views and reputation as a Whig political boss offended many former Democrats in the still new Republican party. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s managers exploited these vulnerabilities to obtain Lincoln&#x27;s nomination. Though disappointed, Weed and Seward both supported Lincoln in the general election. Lincoln won the election handily, defeating John C. Breckinridge, John Bell, and Stephen A. Douglas.

===Civil War===
After Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration, Seward became Secretary of State. Weed became an unofficial envoy and political advisor, with both Seward and Weed providing critical support to Lincoln and the Union during the American Civil War.

In 1861, Weed traveled to Paris with Winfield Scott, where they aided American consul John Bigelow in defusing the Trent Affair, a diplomatic incident with Britain. Later that year, Weed visited Europe with Archbishop John Hughes, and they worked to influence government and public opinion in England and France in favor of the Union.

In December 1862, Lincoln asked Weed to convey a message to Governor Horatio Seymour of New York, a &quot;Peace Democrat&quot;, promising to make way for Seymour&#x27;s succession to the presidency if Seymour would persuade other Peace Democrats to support restoration of the Union. Weed delivered the message, but Seymour took the path of most other Peace Democrats, supporting the Union but remaining critical of what they viewed as the excesses of Lincoln&#x27;s administration.

In February 1863, Weed undertook a special mission for Lincoln when Lincoln asked him to secretly raise $15,000 (about $390,000 in 2020) for an unspecified purpose. Weed was in New York City when he received a telegram asking him to be in Washington the following morning. When they met the next day, Lincoln explained that there was urgent need for the money and that it could not be taken from any available government appropriations. Weed raised the cash, but Lincoln never explained why he needed it or how it was used.

Weed was critical of Lincoln&#x27;s decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, regarding it as too radical and controversial and unsuccessfully arguing for a system of gradual emancipation. In early 1863, he retired as editor of the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; because he disagreed with the Radical Republican view on prosecuting the war and post-war Reconstruction, but as a loyal Republican did not want to make this disagreement public. Weed publicly announced his retirement from the printing and publishing business on January 27, 1863. In the ensuing days his &quot;valedictory address&quot; was printed in full in several newspapers.

Federal patronage in New York caused Lincoln difficulty as Weed and his opponents vied for control of government appointments. In 1864, Lincoln appeased Weed by blocking Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase&#x27;s choice for a new assistant secretary in charge of the New York sub-treasury, which led to Chase&#x27;s resignation. Lincoln then ensured he would have Weed&#x27;s support in the 1864 election by dismissing Hiram Barney, a Radical Republican, as Collector of the Port of New York, and replacing him with Simeon Draper, a Weed ally.

After Lincoln&#x27;s death and the end of the war, Weed and Seward allied with President Andrew Johnson against the Radical Republicans. Both endorsed Johnson&#x27;s more conservative approach to Reconstruction and Seward continued as Secretary of State under Johnson.

==Retirement==

In 1867 Weed retired from public life and moved from Albany to New York City. He briefly owned and edited a newspaper, the &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot;, and remained peripherally engaged in politics, but did not exert the same level of influence that he had had in the past. Weed offered public support to the presidential administration of Ulysses S. Grant. He also engaged in a public feud with Mary Todd Lincoln, who criticized him for opposing efforts to provide her federal financial aid after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination.

During his later years, Weed wrote frequent letters to authors who sought information on New York&#x27;s history, especially details on the growth of towns where Weed had lived as a young man. He also resumed work on an autobiography which he had begun in the 1840s, and which was published by his daughter Harriet in 1883. Weed&#x27;s grandson Thurlow Weed Barnes also published a biography, 1884&#x27;s &quot;Life of Thurlow Weed&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Weed became ill in his final months and suffered from blindness and vertigo. He died in New York City on November 22, 1882. His funeral took place at Manhattan&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church. Pallbearers included James Watson Webb, Hamilton Fish, Frederick W. Seward, John McKeon, and James Bowen. Attendees included James G. Blaine, William M. Evarts, Edwin D. Morgan, Edwards Pierrepont, Hamilton Fish II, Frederick A. Conkling, and many other current and former office holders and newspaper publishers. Weed was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.

==Family==
On April 26, 1818, Weed married Catherine Ostrander (1798-1858) of Cooperstown. They had agreed to marry in 1814, but acceded to the wishes of her parents that they wait until they were older and Weed was more established in his profession. Their children included: James Birdsall (1820-1851), who worked with his father in the publishing business; Harriet Ann (1819-1893), who never married and acted as her father&#x27;s secretary; Emily (1827-1889), the wife of William Barnes Sr.; and Maria (1823-1896), who married Ogden M. Alden.

Weed&#x27;s grandson William Barnes Jr. owned and published the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot;. He was also a longtime leader of New York&#x27;s Republican Party. Weed&#x27;s granddaughter Catharine Weed Barnes was a well-known photographer.

In addition to authoring &quot;Life of Thurlow Weed&quot;, grandson Thurlow Weed Barnes (1853-1918) was a publishing executive at Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. He also pursued business interests in China as operator of the railroad between Hankou and ports in the province of Shandong.

<doc id="1005946" wikidata="Q407560" url="?curid=1005946" title="Squalene">
<text>Squalene is an organic compound. It is a triterpene with the formula C30H50. It is a colourless oil, although impure samples appear yellow. It was originally obtained from shark liver oil (hence its name, as &quot;Squalus&quot; is a genus of sharks). An estimated 12% of bodily squalene in humans is found in sebum. Squalene has a role in topical skin lubrication and protection.

Most plants, fungi, and animals produce squalene as biochemical precursor in sterol biosynthesis, including cholesterol and steroid hormones in the human body. It is also an intermediate in the biosynthesis of hopanoids in many bacteria.

Squalene is an important ingredient in some vaccine adjuvants: The Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline adjuvants are called MF59 and AS03, respectively.

==Role in triterpenoid synthesis==
Squalene is a biochemical precursor to both steroids and hopanoids. For sterols, the squalene conversion begins with oxidation (via squalene monooxygenase) of one of its terminal double bonds, resulting in 2,3-oxidosqualene. It then undergoes an enzyme-catalysed cyclisation to produce lanosterol, which can be elaborated into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol in a multistep process by the removal of three methyl groups, the reduction of one double bond by NADPH and the migration of the other double bond. In many plants, this is then converted into stigmasterol, while in many fungi, it is the precursor to ergosterol.
The biosynthetic pathway is found in many bacteria, and most eukaryotes, though has not been found in Archaea.

==Production==
===Biosynthesis===
Squalene is biosynthesised by coupling two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. The condensation requires NADPH and the enzyme squalene synthase.


===Industry===

Synthetic squalene is prepared commercially from geranylacetone.

===Shark conservation ===
In 2020, conservationists raised concerns about the potential slaughter of sharks to obtain squalene for a COVID-19 vaccine.

Environmental and other concerns over shark hunting have motivated its extraction from other sources. Biosynthetic processes use genetically engineered yeast or bacteria.

==Uses==
===As an adjuvant in vaccines===

Immunologic adjuvants are substances, administered in conjunction with a vaccine, that stimulate the immune system and increase the response to the vaccine. Squalene is not itself an adjuvant, but it has been used in conjunction with surfactants in certain adjuvant formulations.

An adjuvant using squalene is Seqirus&#x27; proprietary MF59, which is added to influenza vaccines to help stimulate the human body&#x27;s immune response through production of CD4 memory cells. It is the first oil-in-water influenza vaccine adjuvant to be commercialised in combination with a seasonal influenza virus vaccine. It was developed in the 1990s by researchers at Ciba-Geigy and Chiron; both companies were subsequently acquired by Novartis. The Influenza vaccine business of Novartis was later acquired by CSL Bering and created the company Seqirus. It is present in the form of an emulsion and is added to make the vaccine more immunogenic. However, the mechanism of action remains unknown. MF59 is capable of switching on a number of genes that partially overlap with those activated by other adjuvants. How these changes are triggered is unclear; to date, no receptors responding to MF59 have been identified. One possibility is that MF59 affects the cell behaviour by changing the lipid metabolism, namely by inducing accumulation of neutral lipids within the target cells. An influenza vaccine called FLUAD which used MF59 as an adjuvant was approved for use in the US in people 65 years of age and older, beginning with the 2016–2017 flu season.

A 2009 meta-analysis assessed data from 64 clinical trials of influenza vaccines with the squalene-containing adjuvant MF59 and compared them to the effects of vaccines with no adjuvant. The analysis reported that the adjuvated vaccines were associated with slightly lower risks of chronic diseases, but that neither type of vaccines altered the rate of autoimmune diseases; the authors concluded that their data &quot;supports the good safety profile associated with MF59-adjuvated influenza vaccines and suggests there may be a clinical benefit over non-MF59-containing vaccines&quot;.

==Safety==
Toxicology studies indicate that in the concentrations used in cosmetics, squalene has low acute toxicity, and is not a significant contact allergen or irritant.

The World Health Organization and the US Department of Defense have both published extensive reports that emphasise that squalene is naturally occurring, even in oils of human fingerprints. The WHO goes further to explain that squalene has been present in over 22 million flu vaccines given to patients in Europe since 1997 without significant vaccine-related adverse events.

===Controversies===
Attempts to link squalene to Gulf War syndrome have been debunked.

<doc id="1005947" wikidata="Q353640" url="?curid=1005947" title="David Hewlett">
<text>David Ian Hewlett (born 18 April 1968) is an English-Canadian actor, writer and director, known for his role as Dr. Rodney McKay in the &quot;Stargate&quot; science-fiction franchise. He first gained fame for his roles as Grant Jansky in the Canadian TV series &quot;Traders&quot; (1996–2000) and as David Worth in the Canadian psychological horror film &quot;Cube&quot; (1997). He appeared in the horror film &quot;Pin&quot; (1988) and the science-fiction films &quot;Scanners II: The New Order&quot; (1991) and &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2011).

== Early life ==
Hewlett was born in Redhill, England, and moved with his family to Canada at the age of four. Hewlett received his first computer in his mid-teens and became a self-described &quot;computer nerd&quot;. While attending high school in Toronto, he launched his acting career, starring in student films by Vincenzo Natali. He dropped out of high school in his senior year to pursue careers in acting and computing, at the beginning of his acting career in 1984 at the age of sixteen.

Before his acting career took off, Hewlett ran Darkyl Media, a web site design firm, and also founded Fusefilm.com, a now defunct internet community for filmmakers.

== Career ==
Hewlett has appeared in many low-budget horror films, such as &quot;The Darkside&quot; and the minor cult favourites &quot;Scanners II: The New Order&quot; and &quot;Pin&quot;. He also guest starred in several television series. In 1996, he landed one of his better-known roles, as Grant Jansky on &quot;Traders&quot;. In 1997, Hewlett worked with Natali again, starring in his critically acclaimed thriller &quot;Cube&quot; as Worth the architect. The low budget Canadian film was commercially successful.
Hewlett, an avid science fiction fan, has been quoted saying that &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a sci-fi program made in his native Britain, is what first sparked his love for the genre, and that he made science fiction with his friends when he was younger in Britain, on his 8 millimetre camera. Hewlett had his early dreams of working in science fiction made into a reality, when he first had a four-episode guest role on the Canadian/American sci-fi series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, as the Stargate expert Rodney McKay, which eventually grew into his starring role on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.

In 2007, Hewlett appeared as a guest star in the first episode of the TV series &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, a show produced by and starring &quot;Stargate&quot; actress Amanda Tapping. He played Larry Tolson, a patient suffering from a form of psychosis who is shot and wounded before being taken into police custody as a murder suspect.

In 2006, he wrote and directed &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; starring himself, his sister Kate Hewlett, his dog Mars, and his &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; costars Paul McGillion, Christopher Judge and Rachel Luttrell. On 23 July 2006, Hewlett created a YouTube channel named Fanatical.

In 2014, Hewlett directed the supernatural horror-science fiction film &quot;Debug&quot; with Jason Momoa, who starred alongside Hewlett in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Jeananne Goossen and Adrian Holmes played the lead roles in the film.

In 2015, Hewlett appeared in the Syfy TV series &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, which is based on the comic book of the same name. He played a recurring role as Tabor Calchek, a merchant who also serves as the team&#x27;s handler. Hewlett continues his interest in filmmaking.

In 2017, he made &quot;HEWLOGRAM,&quot; a sci-fi comedy short showcasing the filmmaking and special effects tools of Red Giant.

<text>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is the central bank of Pakistan. Its Constitution, as originally laid down in the State Bank of Pakistan Order 1948, remained basically unchanged until 1 January 1974, when the bank was nationalised and the scope of its functions was considerably enlarged. The State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956, with subsequent amendments, forms the basis of its operations today. The headquarters are located in the financial capital of the country in Karachi. The bank has a fully owned subsidiary with the name SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP-BSC), the operational arm of the Central Bank with Branch Office in 16 cities across Pakistan, including the capital Islamabad and the four provincial capitals Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta. The State Bank of Pakistan has other fully owned subsidiaries as well: National Institute of Banking and Finance, the training arm of the bank providing training to Commercial Banks, the Deposit Protection Corporation, and ownership of the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation.

== History ==

Before independence on 14 August 1947, during the British colonial era, the Reserve Bank of India was the central bank for the then undivided subcontinent. On 30 December 1948 the British Government&#x27;s commission distributed the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s reserves between Pakistan and India—30 percent (750 M gold) for Pakistan and 70 percent for India.

The losses incurred in the transition to independence, the small amount taken from Pakistan&#x27;s share (a total of 230 million). In May 1948 Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Founder of Pakistan) took steps to establish the State Bank of Pakistan immediately. These were implemented in June 1948, and the State Bank of Pakistan commenced operation on 1 July 1948.

Under the State Bank of Pakistan Order 1948, the State Bank of Pakistan was charged with the duty to &quot;regulate the issue of bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in Pakistan and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage&quot;.

Initially, a large percent of the State Bank was funded by industrial families, who Quaid-e-Azam promoted. They would allot a percentage of their annual profit towards the functioning of the bank. Most notably, the Valika Family would allocate the largest share amongst these families, who also possessed good ties with the Quaid, since September 1947 when the Quaid laid the foundations of the first textile mill of Pakistan, Valika Textile Mills.

A large section of the State Bank&#x27;s duties was widened when the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 was introduced. It required the state bank to &quot;regulate the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and to foster its growth in the best national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilisation of the country&#x27;s productive resources&quot;. In February 1994, the State Bank was given full autonomy, during the financial sector reforms.

On 21 January 1997, this autonomy was further strengthened when the government issued three Amendment Ordinances (which were approved by the Parliament in May 1997). Those included were the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956, Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and Banks Nationalisation Act, 1974. These changes gave full and exclusive authority to the State Bank to regulate the banking sector, to conduct an independent monetary policy and to set a limit on government borrowings from the State Bank of Pakistan. The amendments to the Banks Nationalisation Act brought the end of the Pakistan Banking Council (an institution established to look after the affairs of NCBs) and allowed the jobs of the council to be appointed to the Chief Executives, Boards of the Nationalised Commercial Banks (NCBs) and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). The State Bank had a role in their appointment and removal. The amendments also increased the autonomy and accountability of the chief executives, the Boards of Directors of banks and DFIs.

The State Bank of Pakistan also performs both the traditional and developmental functions to achieve macroeconomic goals. The traditional functions may be classified into two groups:
1) The primary functions including an issue of notes, regulation and supervision of the financial system, bankers&#x27; bank, lender of the last resort, banker to Government, and conduct of monetary policy.
2) The secondary functions including the agency function like management of public debt, management of foreign exchange, etc., and other functions like advising the government on policy matters and maintaining close relationships with international financial institutions.

The non-traditional or promotional functions, performed by the State Bank include the development of a financial framework, institutionalisation of savings and investment, provision of training facilities to bankers, and provision of credit to priority sectors. The State Bank also has been playing an active part in the process of Islamisation of the banking system.

The Bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico. In 2019, the SBP launched the National Payment Systems Strategy to lay out a framework for Pakistan to foster a modern digital payments infrastructure.

== Regulation of liquidity ==

The State Bank of Pakistan has also been entrusted with the responsibility to carry out monetary and credit policy in accordance with Government targets for growth and inflation with the recommendations of the Monetary and Fiscal Policies Co-ordination Board without trying to effect the macroeconomic policy objectives.

The state bank also regulates the volume and the direction of flow of credit to different uses and sectors, the state bank makes use of both direct and indirect instruments of monetary management. During the 1980s, Pakistan embarked upon a program of financial sector reforms, which lead to a number of fundamental changes. Due to these changes the conduct of monetary management which brought about changes to the administrative controls and quantitative restrictions to market based monetary management. A reserve money management programme has been developed, for intermediate target of M2, that would be achieved by observing the desired path of reserve money – the operating target.

State Bank of Pakistan has changed the format and designs of many bank notes which are currently in circulation in Pakistan. These steps were taken to overcome the problems of fraudulent activities.

== Banking ==

<doc id="1005971" wikidata="Q1848899" url="?curid=1005971" title="Spiral valve">
<text>A spiral valve or scroll valve is the corkscrew-shaped lower portion of the intestine of some sharks, Acipenseriformes (sturgeon and paddlefish), rays, skates, bichirs, Lepisosteiformes (gars), and lungfishes. A modification of the ileum, the spiral valve is internally twisted or coiled to increase the surface area of the intestine which increases nutrient absorption.

== Description ==

The intestines of a shark are much shorter than those of mammals. Sharks have compensated for this problem by having a spiral valve, or a scroll valve, inside the intestine to increase the absorbent surface of the intestine. By keeping digestible material in the ileum for an extended period maximum nutrient absorption is ensured. For this reason, many sharks and related fish feed very infrequently. The food passes into the comparatively short colon of the shark almost fully digested, and then out the cloaca and vent.

A consequence of the spiral valve constricting the lumen of the ileum is that sharks cannot pass large hard objects (such as bones) through their lower intestine. Such objects instead remain in the stomach until sufficiently broken down for passing through the valve region, or are regurgitated. Consequently, shark stomachs often contain items of interest that enable one to determine what the animals feed on, as well as non-food items ingested during a feeding frenzy.

Sharks also possess a rectal gland that removes excess salt.

==Overview==
The earliest recorded reference to Childwall was in the Domesday Book of 1086: &quot;Four Radmans held Childwall as four Manors. There is half a hide. It was worth eight shillings. There was a priest, having half a carucate of land in frank almoign.&quot; Childwall was known as &quot;Cildeuuelle&quot; in the Domesday Book, meaning &quot;a stream where youngsters meet&quot; from the Old English words &quot;cild&quot; and &quot;wella&quot;. Historically, the name has been recorded as &quot;Childewalle&quot; (1212 and 1332), &quot;Chaldewall&quot; (1238), &quot;Childwall&quot; (1261), &quot;Childewelle&quot; (1291), &quot;Chaldewal&quot; (1305), and &quot;Childewall&quot; (1354).

Childwall was traditionally part of the West Derby Hundred. It was an urban district from the Local Government Act 1894 until Liverpool county borough annexed it on 9 November 1913. In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 144. On 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. The suburb&#x27;s All Saints&#x27; Church is the oldest church in Liverpool. Though Childwall still maintains a large Jewish community, this has been in gradual decline since the 1980s, with some of the former Jewish community now living in the nearby suburbs of Allerton and Gateacre.

Childwall has a large roundabout called the Childwall Fiveways, which is one of the busiest in Liverpool. Since the year 2000, the area immediately surrounding the Fiveways has gradually developed into an area for bars and restaurants. Childwall&#x27;s pubs include the Childwall Abbey Hotel, the Halfway House, and the Childwall Fiveways Hotel. Housing in Childwall is almost entirely detached or semi-detached, and there are very few terraced houses.

The television production company Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, is headquartered on a patch of private land in Childwall Woods. The company&#x27;s most notable productions are &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, &quot;Brookside&quot;, &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, &quot;Geordie Shore&quot;, and &quot;The Only Way Is Essex&quot;. The first three are filmed in Childwall, while the last two are respectively filmed in Newcastle and Brentwood.

<text>Various methods of transporting children have been used in different cultures and times. These methods include baby carriages (prams in British English), infant car seats, portable bassinets (carrycots), strollers (pushchairs), slings, backpacks, baskets and bicycle carriers.

The large, heavy prams (short for perambulator), which had become popular during the Victorian era, were replaced by lighter designs during the latter half of the 1900s.

==Baskets, slings and backpacks==
Infant carrying likely emerged early in human evolution as the emergence of bipedalism would have necessitated some means of carrying babies who could no longer cling to their mothers and/or simply sit on top of their mother&#x27;s back. On-the-body carriers are designed in various forms such as baby sling, backpack carriers, and soft front or hip carriers, with varying materials and degrees of rigidity, decoration, support and confinement of the child. Slings, soft front carriers, and &quot;baby carriages&quot; are typically used for infants who lack the ability to sit or to hold their head up. Frame backpack carriers (a modification of the frame backpack), hip carriers, slings, &quot;mei tai&quot;s and a variety of other soft carriers are used for older children.


Images of children being carried in slings can be seen in Egyptian artwork dating back to the time of the Pharaohs, and have been used in many indigenous cultures. One of the earliest European artworks showing baby wearing is a fresco by Giotto painted in around 1306 AD, which depicts Mary carrying Jesus in a sling. Baby wearing in a sling was well known in Europe in medieval times, but was mainly seen as a practice of marginalised groups such as beggars and Romani people. A cradleboard is a Native American baby carrier used to keep babies secure and comfortable and at the same time allowing the mothers freedom to work and travel. The cradleboards were attached to the mother&#x27;s back straps from the shoulder or the head. For travel, cradleboards could be hung on a saddle or travois. Ethnographic tradition indicates that it was common practice to cradleboard newborn children until they were able to walk, although many mothers continued to swaddle their children well past the first birthday. Bound and wrapped on a cradleboard, a baby can feel safe and secure. Soft materials such as lichens, moss and shredded bark were used for cushioning and diapers. Cradleboards were either cut from flat pieces of wood or woven from flexible twigs like willow and hazel, and cushioned with soft, absorbent materials. The design of most cradleboards is a flat surface with the child wrapped tightly to it. It is usually only able to move its head.

On-the-body baby carrying started being known in western countries in the 1960s, with the advent of the structured soft pack in the mid-1960s. Around the same time, the frame backpack quickly became a popular way to carry older babies and toddlers. In the early 1970s, the wrap was reintroduced in Germany. The two ringed sling was invented by Rayner and Fonda Garner in 1981 and popularized by Dr William Sears starting in around 1985. In the early 1990s, the modern pouch carrier was created in Hawaii. While the Chinese &quot;mei tai&quot; has been around in one form or another for centuries, it did not become popular in the west until it was modernized with padding and other adjustments. It first became popular and well known in mid-2003.

Portable cradles, including cradleboards, baskets, and bassinets, have been used by many cultures to carry young infants.

==Wheeled transport methods==

Wheeled devices are generally divided into prams, used for newborn babies in which the infant normally lies down facing the pusher, and the strollers, which are used for the small child up to about three years old in a sitting position facing forward.

===History===
William Kent developed an early stroller in 1733. In 1733, the Duke of Devonshire asked Kent to build a means of transport that would carry his children. Kent obliged by constructing a shell shaped basket on wheels that the children could sit in. This was richly decorated and meant to be pulled by a goat or small pony. Benjamin Potter Crandall sold baby carriages in the US in the 1830s which have been described as the &quot;first baby carriages manufactured in the US&quot;. Another early development was F.A. Whitney Carriage Company. His son, Jesse Armour Crandall was issued a number of patents for improvements and additions to the standard models. These included adding a brake to carriages, a model which folded, designs for parasols and an umbrella hanger. By 1840, the baby carriage became extremely popular. Queen Victoria bought three carriages from Hitchings Baby Store.

The carriages of those days were built of wood or wicker and held together by expensive brass joints. These sometimes became heavily ornamented works of art. Models were also named after royalty: Princess and Duchess being popular names, as well as Balmoral and Windsor.

In June 1889, an African American man named William H. Richardson patented his idea of the first reversible stroller. The bassinet was designed so it could face out or in towards the parent. He also made structural changes to the carriage. Until then the axle did not allow each wheel to move separately. Richardson&#x27;s design allowed this, which increased maneuverability of the carriages. As the 1920s began, prams were now available to all families and were becoming safer, with larger wheels, brakes, deeper prams, and lower, sturdier frames.

In 1965, Owen Maclaren, an aeronautical engineer, worked on complaints his daughter made about travelling from England to America with her heavy pram. Using his knowledge of aeroplanes, Maclaren designed a stroller with an aluminium frame and created the first true umbrella stroller. He then went on to found Maclaren, which manufactured and sold his new design. The design took off and soon &quot;strollers&quot; were easier to transport and used everywhere.

In the 1970s, however, the trend was more towards a more basic version, not fully sprung, and with a detachable body known as a &quot;carrycot&quot;. Now, prams are very rarely used, being large and expensive when compared with &quot;buggies&quot; (see below). One of the longer lived and better known brands in the UK is Silver Cross, first manufactured in Hunslet, Leeds, in 1877, and later Guiseley from 1936 until 2002 when the factory closed. Silver Cross was then bought by the toy company David Halsall and Sons who relocated the head office to Skipton and expanded into a range of new, modern baby products including pushchairs and &quot;travel systems&quot;. They continue to sell the traditional Silver Cross coach prams which are manufactured at a factory in Bingley in Yorkshire.

Since the 1980s, the stroller industry has developed with new features, safer construction and more accessories.

===Prams===
Larger and heavier prams, or perambulators, had been used since their introduction in the Victorian era; prams were also used for infants, often sitting up. The term carrycot became more common in the UK after the introduction of lighter units with detachable baby carriers in the 1970s.

As they developed through the years suspension was added, making the ride smoother for both the baby and the person pushing it.

The word &quot;pram&quot; is etymologically a shortening of its now less common synonym &quot;perambulator&quot;.

===Strollers===

&quot;Strollers&quot; or &quot;pushchairs/buggies&quot; (British English) are used for small children up to about three years old in a sitting position facing forward.

&quot;Pushchair&quot; was the popularly used term in the UK between its invention and the early 1980s, when a more compact design known as a &quot;buggy&quot; became the trend, popularised by the conveniently collapsible aluminium-framed Maclaren buggy designed and patented by the British aeronautical designer Owen Maclaren in 1965. &quot;Buggy&quot; is the usual term in the UK (sometimes &quot;pushchair&quot;); in American English, buggy usually refers to a four-wheeled vehicle known as a quad or quad bike in the UK. &quot;Stroller&quot; is the usual term in the USA. Newer versions can be configured to carry a baby lying down like a low pram and then be reconfigured to carry the child in the forward-facing position.

A variety of twin pushchairs are manufactured, some designed for babies of a similar age (such as twins) and some for those with a small age gap. Triple pushchairs are a fairly recent addition, due to the number of multiple births being on the increase. Safety guidelines for standard pushchairs apply. Most triple buggies have a weight limit of 50 kg and recommended use for children up to the age of four years.

A travel system is typically a set consisting of a chassis with a detachable baby seat and/or carrycot. Thus a travel system can be switched between a pushchair and a pram. Another benefit of a travel system is that the detached chassis (generally an umbrella closing chassis) when folded will usually be smaller than other types, to transport it in a car trunk or boot. Also, the baby seat will snap into a base meant to stay in an automobile, becoming a car seat. This allows undisturbed movement of the baby into or out of a car and a reduced chance of waking a sleeping baby.

Another modern design showcases a stroller that includes the possibility for the lower body to be elongated, thereby transforming the stroller into a kick scooter. Steering occurs by leaning towards either side. Depending on the model, it can be equipped with a foot- and/or handbrake. Speeds up to can be reached. The first stroller of this kind was the so-called &quot;Roller Buggy&quot;, developed by industrial designer Valentin Vodev in 2005. In 2012 the manufacturer Quinny became interested in the concept and teamed up with a Belgian studio to design another model.

The modern infant car seat is a relative latecomer. It is used to carry a child within a car. Such car seats are required by law in many countries to safely transport young children.

In contemporary culture, with four-figure systems or sleek jogging strollers common in some circles, strollers often serve as not only an infant transport device but also a highly visible symbol of everything from class to parenting philosophy.

==Others==


Bicycles can be fitted with a bicycle trailer or a children&#x27;s bicycle seat to carry small children. An older child can ride his own bike, or ride a one-wheel trailer bike with an integrated seat and handle bars.

A &quot;travel system&quot; includes a car seat base, an infant car seat, and a baby stroller. The car seat base is installed in a car. The infant car seat snaps into the car seat base when traveling with a baby. From the car, the infant car seat can be hand carried and snapped onto the stroller.

<text>The .22 CB Cap (Conical Bullet Cap), also known as the 6mm Flobert, is a more powerful version of the .22 BB Cap rimfire metallic cartridge, which was invented by Louis-Nicolas Flobert in 1845. The .22 BB Cap and .22 CB Cap are interchangeable and are relatively quiet, low velocity cartridges, designed for indoor target shooting.

==History==
Designed to be a cross between the .22 BB and .22 Short, and first catalogued in around 1888 (though probably first made before that), it &quot;managed to combine about all the disadvantages...[of both] into one generally useless cartridge&quot;, being no more accurate than either while being noisier than the .22 BB Cap, and penetrating much deeper, requiring a backstop as strong as for the .22 Short, thereby negating the CB Cap&#x27;s advantages for shooting indoors. American ammunition manufacturers dropped the .22 CB Cap in the 1940s. 

In Europe, the .22 BB Cap and .22 CB Cap are both called &quot;6mm Flobert&quot; and are considered the same cartridge. In Europe, the cartridge is still used in cheap rifles meant for short-range pest control. Although RWS in Germany, Eley-Kynoch in Britain, and Alcan stopped making the 6mm Flobert in the 1970s, it is still manufactured and sold in some European countries. For example, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Flobert guns fall within the same weapon category as air rifles, which are usually unaffected by gun laws. 6mm Flobert ammunition is also used in antique firearms chambered for the .22 Short and the .22 Long, as most modern ammunition has much higher pressure than the old black powder cartridges these guns were chambered for.

==Description==
The .22 CB Cap has a very small propellant charge (usually no gunpowder, just the primer), resulting in a low muzzle velocities of between 350 and 853 feet per second (107 and 260 m/s). Due to their low power, classic CB rounds used in indoor target practice can be trapped by many pellet gun traps since some modern pellet guns exceed the velocity of the CB round (however, this depends on the limits designed in the individual pellet trap). In longer rifle barrels the CB has a &quot;very&quot; quiet, seemingly non-existent report due to the lack of residual pressure at the muzzle (see Internal ballistics). The CB loses velocity fast in longer barrels, due to the lack of anything other than the primer as a propellant.

===Modern rounds===
The original .22 CB Cap has the same tiny case as the .22 BB Cap and the two cartridges are interchangeable. There are now .22 rounds sold as .22 CB Short and .22 CB Long which come in the standard .22 Rimfire cartridge case sizes to allow the rounds to be used in standard magazine-fed firearms which would likely jam with the tiny BB or CB cases. The CCI .22 CB Short and .22 CB Long use the same 29-grain bullet as the regular .22 Short and .22 Long. The CCI CB rounds have muzzle velocities of 720 feet per second (ft/s) for an impact energy of 33 foot/pounds (ft-lb). The standard .22 Short and .22 Long fire the same bullet weight at 1,045 ft/s for 70 ft-lb. The CB rounds are relatively quiet for short range target practice, control of small pests, or use in older .22 guns that might not be safe with modern high pressure rounds. For trapping these CB Short and CB Long rounds in indoor target practice, a standard .22 bullet trap is needed. Other modern CB type rounds, such as the .22 Aguila Colibri and .22 Aguila Super Colibri, have bullets in the same weight range as the original CB Cap with velocities in the 300 ft/s to 500 ft/s range using the Long case. The CCI CB Short cartridge contains a half grain of a fine propellant.

<text>Hejji is a short-lived 1935 comic strip, an early work and the only comic strip by prominent children&#x27;s author Dr. Seuss (pseudonym of Theodor Geisel). &quot;Hejji&quot; was produced by Geisel during the Great Depression, two years before the publication of his first book.

Distributed by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate, &quot;Hejji&quot; began publication on April 7, 1935, as a Sunday strip. A comic strip with an unusually brief publication period, it was canceled after only three months; the final comic was published on June 23, 1935.

==Characters and story==
The title character was a traveler who, in the first strip, entered the strange land of Baako, which had whales swimming in water-filled volcano craters, a flower broadcasting music and twin goats sharing a single beard. Hejji inadvertently plucks the sacred Trumpet Flower and is promptly arrested. He is taken to the palace of the Mighty One, who has Hejji thrown to the Seven Deadly Wombats. After Hejji escapes, the Mighty One apologizes and gives him a guided tour of Baako. They encounter various creatures and eventually arrive at the mysterious castle of the Evil One.

==Recycling characters==
Characters and situations from &quot;Hejji&quot; reappeared in later Dr. Seuss work. For example, the two goats with the single beard reappeared in the musical fantasy film &quot;The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T&quot;, scripted by Geisel.

<text>Mr. Zog&#x27;s Sex Wax is a brand of surfwax manufactured for use on surfboards that is produced in Carpinteria, California. This wax is rubbed on the top surface or &quot;deck&quot; of a surfboard to allow traction and grip for the surfer.

Mr. Zog&#x27;s Sex Wax was first produced by Frederick Charles Herzog, III (also known as &quot;Mr. Zog&quot;) and chemist Nate Skinner in 1972. Hank Pitcher designed their original logo.

Due to the product name, promotional materials such as bumper stickers and t-shirts became extremely popular, even among those who had never ridden a surfboard. Their slogans, such as &quot;The best for your stick&quot;, included innuendos of non-surfing uses. The materials confirmed their counterculture status by being banned from schools and amusement parks.

Different wax formulations are sold under the names: &quot;Quick Humps&quot;, &quot;Really Tacky&quot;, and &quot;Navel Wax&quot;.

== Market expansion == 

A snowboard wax is sold by Mr. Zog&#x27;s, which is applied to the bottom of a snowboard to reduce friction between the snowboard and the snow. One variety is melted and applied to the bottom of the snowboard, another variety is rubbed on as a cold wax.

Mr. Zog&#x27;s Sex Wax is also sold to ice hockey players. The wax is applied by rubbing it on over the tape on the blade of the stick. This does two things: it flattens the tape to allow a smoother shot, and it also makes the blade of the stick stickier, which helps hockey players control the puck for stick-handling, passing, and shooting purposes. Also the wax acts as a surfactant, also called surface-active agent, to aid moisture dispersion from the blade during ice hockey sessions. In addition, some goaltenders rub the wax on the shaft of the stick to help them hold the stick when it is struck by hard shots, some of which exceed 100 MPH.

Sex Wax for drummers is marketed and distributed by Big Bang Distribution company.

== Product placement ==
The product has been used in a number of media productions:
* &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;. The protagonists locate a murderer by determining that he used pineapple Sex Wax on a credit card that was in turn used to break into his victim&#x27;s home. 
* &quot;Point Break&quot;: The protagonists determine that some bank robbers are surfers because a small amount of Sex Wax is found at the scene of the crime.
* &quot;NCIS&quot;: Featured in the episode &quot;Bikini Wax&quot;.

* &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;: The protagonist played by &quot;Joseph Gordon-Levitt&quot; wears a Mr Zogs Sex Wax logo singlet during the film.

<text>Yixuan (16 October 1840 – 1 January 1891), formally known as [[Prince Chun (醇)|Prince Chun]], was an imperial prince of the House of Aisin-Gioro and a statesman of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in China. He was the father of the Guangxu Emperor (his second son), and the paternal grandfather of Puyi (the Last Emperor) through his fifth son Zaifeng.

==Family background==
Yixuan was born in the Aisin-Gioro clan as the seventh son of the Daoguang Emperor. His mother was Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangshun of the Uya (烏雅氏) clan. Four months after his birth, Lady Uya, a who was recently promoted to &quot;Noble Lady Lin&quot; (琳貴人), was further elevated to the status of &quot;Imperial Concubine Lin&quot; (琳嬪), a rare distinction. Lady Uya&#x27;s rapid rise through the ranks continued, and she was promoted to &quot;Consort Lin&quot; (琳妃) and &quot;Noble Consort Lin&quot; (琳貴妃) in 1842 and 1847 respectively. The Tongzhi Emperor granted her the posthumous title &quot;Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangshun&quot; (莊順皇貴妃).

In February 1850, after the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s death, Yixuan&#x27;s fourth brother, Yizhu, ascended the throne and became historically known as the Xianfeng Emperor. The Xianfeng Emperor made Yixuan a &quot;junwang&quot; (second-rank prince) under the title &quot;Prince Chun of the Second Rank&quot; (醇郡王). Yixuan kept a low profile in politics throughout the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s 11-year reign.

In 1860, by the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s decree, Yixuan married Wanzhen of the Yehe Nara clan, who was the younger sister of Empress Dowager Cixi, who at that time was one of the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s consorts. The marriage forged a close bond between Yixuan and Empress Dowager Cixi. The Xianfeng Emperor died in August 1861, leaving the throne to his five-year-old son, Zaichun, who would reign as the Tongzhi Emperor. On the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s death, a power struggle emerged over the regency for the emperor, with one faction led by Sushun, and princes Duanhua and Zaiyuan, and another faction led by Yixuan&#x27;s sixth brother, Prince Gong, as well as the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s empress, honoured with the title of Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, and Noble Consort Yi, the mother of the new emperor, honored with the title of Empress Dowager Cixi. In November 1861, Yixuan sided with Prince Gong and the two dowager empresses and launched the Xinyou Coup to seize the regency from Sushun and his faction. Yixuan personally led imperial forces to arrest Sushun and bring him back to Beijing, where he was executed.

As a consequence of the Xinyou Coup, Yixuan found himself elevated to the highest ranks in the imperial court. In the 14-year reign of the Tongzhi Emperor from 1861 to 1875, he had a dual career in the military and civil services. In 1872, he was promoted from &quot;junwang&quot; (second-rank prince) to a &quot;qinwang&quot; (first-rank prince), hence he became known as &quot;Prince Chun of the First Rank&quot; (醇親王). In 1874, he was dismissed from office by the Tongzhi Emperor, along with Prince Gong, and several others, due to his involvement in a reprimand of the emperor for his poor conduct, only to be reinstated, along with the others, thanks to the intervention of the dowager empresses.

==During the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s reign==
In January 1875, the Tongzhi Emperor died without an heir, so Empress Dowager Cixi chose Yixuan&#x27;s second son, Zaitian, to be the new emperor. Zaitian was adopted into the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s lineage; this meant that he was nominally no longer Yixuan&#x27;s son. As the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s &quot;son&quot;, Zaitian was installed on the throne and became historically known as the Guangxu Emperor. This choice brought advantages to Cixi: Zaitian was her nephew (Zaitian&#x27;s mother, Wanzhen, was Cixi&#x27;s younger sister); Zaitian&#x27;s father, Yixuan, had been a loyal supporter of Cixi; Zaitian was still young so Cixi could continue ruling as regent. As for Yixuan himself, however, Cixi&#x27;s choice was a catastrophe for him. When he heard that his son had been chosen to be the new emperor, he reportedly hit himself and wept bitterly before sinking into unconsciousness.

In the last centuries of imperial China, it was very unusual for an emperor&#x27;s father to be still alive while the emperor was reigning. The only prior example in the Qing dynasty was that of the situation between 1796 and 1799, when the Qianlong Emperor abdicated in favour of his 15th son, the Jiaqing Emperor, and became a &quot;taishang huang&quot; (retired emperor). Since filial piety is a highly revered value in Chinese culture, it meant that Yixuan, the biological father of the reigning emperor, would be endowed with the highest honours and privileges. However, Yixuan perceived himself to be in an extremely dangerous and uncomfortable position, given the prickly nature of Empress Dowager Cixi and her obsessional paranoia of any potential threat to her status.

The first decision that Yixuan made, after his son became the emperor, was to resign from all his official positions. He tried to keep a low profile but could not avoid being showered with honours and privileges, which he tried to decline as much as possible. Soon after his son became the emperor, Yixuan was awarded the &quot;iron-cap&quot; privilege, which meant that he could pass on his Prince Chun title to his descendants without the title being downgraded one grade per generation.

In 1876, Yixuan wrote a memorial to the Guangxu Emperor, condemning in advance anyone who would propose to grant him a special position in the hierarchy on the grounds that he was the emperor&#x27;s biological father. Following resignation from his military and civil posts, he was entrusted with the education of the young emperor, to which he consented. In the following years, with the disgrace of his sixth brother Yixin (Prince Gong), Yixuan unwillingly became the second most powerful figure in the imperial court after Empress Dowager Cixi. The empress dowager even ordered all court officials to discuss matters with Yixuan before making decisions.

Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s co-regent, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, died suddenly in 1881 and was rumoured to have been poisoned by Cixi. This made Yixuan even more cautious and eager to please Cixi in all possible ways. When the Guangxu Emperor reached adulthood in early 1887 and was ready to take over the reins of power from Empress Dowager Cixi, Yixuan formally requested Cixi to prolong her regency.

In 1885, Empress Dowager Cixi appointed Yixuan as &quot;Controller of the Admiralty&quot;, putting him in charge of supervising the building of a new imperial navy. Yixuan was sent on an inspection tour to the naval shipyards on the coast of China.

Before her adopted son, Emperor Guangxu, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan&#x27;s victories over China has often been falsely rumored to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy&#x27;s defeat by embezzling funds from the navy in order to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, extensive research by Chinese historians revealed that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy&#x27;s decline. In actuality, China&#x27;s defeat was caused by Emperor Guangxu&#x27;s lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on.

Yixuan died on 1 January 1891, shortly before the enlargement works on the Summer Palace were completed. His fifth son, Zaifeng, inherited his title &quot;Prince Chun of the First Rank&quot;. Yixuan was granted a posthumous name &quot;xian&quot; (賢), so his full posthumous title became &quot;Prince Chunxian of the First Rank&quot; (醇賢親王).

==Prince Chun Tomb==

Yixuan was interred in a tomb of princely status, now popularly known as the &quot;Seventh Prince&#x27;s Grave&quot; (七王墳), located 35 km/22 miles northwest of Beijing. According to Puyi&#x27;s autobiography, a ginkgo tree grew on the tomb of Yixuan, and became very tall and imposing. This fact was reported to Empress Dowager Cixi and greatly alarmed her. In the Chinese language, the first character of the word &quot;ginkgo tree&quot; is &quot;bai&quot; (白), while the first character of the word &quot;emperor&quot; is &quot;huang&quot; (皇), which combines the character &quot;bai&quot; with the character &quot;wang&quot; (王 – meaning &quot;prince&quot;, 親王). A ginkgo (白) growing on the tomb of Yixuan (王) was interpreted as a sign that a new emperor (皇) would emerge in the house of Yixuan. This was unacceptable for the very superstitious Cixi, as obsessed as ever with thwarting any challenge to her power, and so she promptly had the tree felled. The tomb of Yixuan was restored by the People&#x27;s Republic of China after 1949 and is now one of the tourist attractions around Beijing.

The tomb and surrounding area appears in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; as the home and training grounds of the legendary Shaolin monk Pai Mei.

==Prince Chun Mansion==
A former residence of Yixuan, now known as the Prince Chun Mansion, is located near Shichahai, Beijing.

<doc id="1005999" wikidata="Q919088" url="?curid=1005999" title="1974 British Commonwealth Games">
<text>The 1974 British [[Commonwealth Games]] () were held in Christchurch, New Zealand, from 24 January to 2 February 1974. The bid vote was held in Edinburgh at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games. The event was officially named &quot;the friendly games&quot;. There were 1,276 competitors and 372 officials, according to the official history, and public attendance was excellent. The main venue was the QEII Park, purpose-built for this event. The Athletics Stadium and fully covered Olympic standard pool, diving tank, and practice pools were all on the one site. The theme song was &quot;Join Together&quot;, sung by Steve Allen. The event was held after the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin for wheelchair athletes.

==Host selection==
== Preparation ==

=== Security ===
The event was the first large international athletic event after the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The Athletes Village, the Student accommodation of the University of Canterbury, was temporarily fenced in and guarded for the duration of the games. Only official vehicles and persons were allowed into sensitive areas around the venues.

=== Logo ===
The logo was the second (after Edinburgh) to be protected and trademarked, and set a design benchmark which was echoed in the logos of the next five games. The logo was designed by Wellington designer Colin Simons as the result of a design competition, and posters were designed by Bret de Thier.

In recent years the logo has been regarded as one of New Zealand&#x27;s iconic symbols, being reproduced on clothing and elsewhere.

== Venues ==
* Queen Elizabeth II Park – ceremonies, athletics, diving, swimming
* Cowles Stadium – badminton
* Woolston Working Men&#x27;s Club – bowls
* Canterbury Court – boxing
* Denton Park – track cycling
* Christchurch Town Hall – weightlifting, wrestling
* McLeans Island – shooting (smallbore)
* West Melton – shooting (largebore)
* Yaldhurst – shooting (trap)
* Cashmere/Beckenham/Huntsbury – road cycling
* University of Canterbury – athlete&#x27;s village

==Opening ceremony==

The opening ceremony was held in the mid afternoon, with Prince Philip as the attending royal. A fanfare announced the guard of honour by the New Zealand Defence Forces, inspected by Prince Philip. This was followed by the raising of flags of the past, present, and future hosts. God Save the Queen was sung. The field was then invaded by 2500 school children in red, white and blue rain slicks all forming in the centre to create the NZ74 symbol. The official promotional song, &#x27;Join Together&#x27;, composed especially for the games by Steve Allen, was performed by a mass choir, as well as &#x27;What the world needs now is love&#x27;. A Māori concert group then performed action songs and a haka, before the teams march past. The athletes then took the oath and Sylvia Potts, the runner who fell mere meters from a gold medal finish in the 1970 Games, entered the stadium with the Queen&#x27;s Baton. It was presented to Prince Philip who read the message from the Queen declaring the 1974 Christchurch 10th British Commonwealth Games open. The Commonwealth flag was then marched in and hauled up with a 21-gun salute.

==Broadcasting==
The Games were also an important milestone in New Zealand television, marking the introduction of colour television. However, due to the NZBC&#x27;s limited colour facilities, only athletics, swimming, and boxing could be broadcast in colour.

Meanwhile, paralleling the television coverage, the National Film Unit produced Games &#x27;74, a feature-length documentary of the Christchurch games (and the many events) in full colour. This has since been restored and is available on DVD.

== Legacy ==

=== Economic aspects ===

Christchurch was (and still is) the smallest city to host the modern televised Commonwealth Games. This was the first games that tried using the &quot;Olympic&quot; look with a standard colour scheme for facilities, passes, flags, stationery, and above all uniforms (which wearers only borrowed, but could buy outright as a memento thus helping keep costs down).

Its striking NZ74 design logo is now a well used (sometimes illegally) symbol of New Zealand as a nation and Christchurch as a city. It is still copyright owned by Christchurch City Council but is allowed for free use unless for commercial gain. Badges, lapels, stationery and postcards are still in re-manufactured circulation.

This was also the first time that a city had asked the Games Federation to allow commercial advertising. This was voted down as the Federation feared that advertising by big corporations would remove focus away from the amateur ethos of the Games. As no commercial hoardings were allowed, Christchurch got around this with the use of &quot;sponsorship&quot;, one example being General Motors providing a lease fleet of Holden HQ Kingswood sedans that would be sold off after the games. The cars are now sought after by private and museum collectors and have depreciated little in value.
Air New Zealand allowed large NZ74 symbols to be placed on the fuselage sides of the airline&#x27;s brand new McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, giving free advertising around the world. This in itself set a trend since with airlines vying to be &quot;official airline&quot; of a particular event.

Although the Games themselves were a success, making a then sizable profit of $500,000, the &quot;sponsorship&quot; was nowhere near enough. The City of Christchurch was left with a financial facilities management debt (QEII Park) of what would be in today&#x27;s (2016) amount of NZ$120 million. This deterred the city from hosting major events until 1990 when the government stepped in with lotteries funding to clear the remaining debt. By then, Auckland&#x27;s 1990 games had been fully commercialized.

Queen Elizabeth II Park
The most visible facility left behind by the 1974 Commonwealth Games was the purpose-built stadium and swimming complex. For a few years after, the stadium was a popular destination for sports and leisure patrons who were well indulged in first class facilities. However the costs of maintaining the complex grew over time and soon other additions included hydro-slides and fun park outside on the large grassed area that was once the race course. Christchurch City Council, the owner of the complex continued to develop the ground and for five years from 1990, allowed the Canterbury Greyhound Club to run a track on the inner oval. The main swimming pool was adapted so it could be decked over for Basketball and Netball. Football and Rugby League returned to the stadium in 1995 on a more permanent basis and a minor refurbishment of the track saw athletics events become a main summer event again. Early plans for a hosting of the 2022 Commonwealth Games were in hand when the September 2010 earthquake of around 7.1 hit near Christchurch and damaged the facility. Assessors immediately reported that the damage was repairable and could be covered by insurance. The swimming pools were drained to await repair when the more devastating 22 February 2011 earthquake struck Christchurch, damaging the entire facility, already weakened, beyond economic repair. After laying abandoned for three years, the stadium was demolished and by 2016 the ground stabilized in preparation of more economical facilities and a connecting high school.

Future 2026/2030 Bids proposals
As a rebuilding legacy, there have been calls for Christchurch to bid for the new style Commonwealth Games that allow a core central city to host a more nationwide event. This has been seen as a more economical format for smaller cities, and countries to host what had become an expensive event for a singular city to host.

=== Precedents set ===
While the opening ceremony was a regimented and very formal affair, the late afternoon closing ceremony was anything but. 
This set a precedent for other closing ceremonies since then. With the formalities out of the way, the handing over of the flag to representatives of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the athletes broke ranks and ran amok, much to the delight of the packed stadium and the Queen herself. A flypast of the then Red Checkers RNZAF display team brought the ceremony to a close as the Queen and Prince Philip did a lap of honour around the stadium and departed.

The youngest competitor at the games was New Zealander Rebecca Perrott, 12; swimming for Fiji at the games, as her father was Registrar at the University of the South Pacific.

<doc id="1006006" wikidata="Q962872" url="?curid=1006006" title="Apomorphy and synapomorphy">
<text>In phylogenetics, an apomorphy (or derived trait) is a novel character or character state that has evolved from its ancestral form (or plesiomorphy). A synapomorphy is an apomorphy shared by two or more taxa and is therefore hypothesized to have evolved in their most recent common ancestor. In cladistics, synapomorphy implies homology.

Examples of apomorphy are the presence of erect gait, fur, the evolution of three middle ear bones, and mammary glands in mammals but not in other vertebrate animals such as amphibians or reptiles, which have retained their ancestral traits of a sprawling gait and lack of fur. Thus, these derived traits are also synapomorphies of mammals in general as they are not shared by other vertebrate animals.

== Etymology ==
The word —coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig—is derived from the Ancient Greek words (&quot;sún&quot;), meaning &quot;with, together&quot;; (&quot;apó&quot;), meaning &quot;away from&quot;; and (&quot;morphḗ&quot;), meaning &quot;shape, form&quot;.

== Examples ==
Lampreys and sharks share some features, like a nervous system, that are not synapomorphic because they are also shared by invertebrates. In contrast, the presence of jaws and paired appendages in both sharks and dogs, but not in lampreys or close invertebrate relatives, identifies these traits as synapomorphies. This supports the hypothesis that dogs and sharks are more closely related to each other than to lampreys.

== Clade analysis ==
The concept of synapomorphy depends on a given clade in the tree of life. Cladograms are diagrams that depict evolutionary relationships within groups of taxa. These illustrations are accurate predictive device in modern genetics. They are usually depicted in either tree or ladder form. Synapomorphies then create evidence for historical relationships and their associated hierarchical structure. Evolutionarily, a synapomorphy is the marker for the most recent common ancestor of the monophyletic group consisting of a set of taxa in a cladogram. What counts as a synapomorphy for one clade may well be a primitive character or plesiomorphy at a less inclusive or nested clade. For example, the presence of mammary glands is a synapomorphy for mammals in relation to tetrapods but is a symplesiomorphy for mammals in relation to one another—rodents and primates, for example. So the concept can be understood as well in terms of &quot;a character newer than&quot; (autapomorphy) and &quot;a character older than&quot; (plesiomorphy) the apomorphy: mammary glands are evolutionarily newer than vertebral column, so mammary glands are an autapomorphy if vertebral column is an apomorphy, but if mammary glands are the apomorphy being considered then vertebral column is a plesiomorphy.

== Relations to other terms ==
These phylogenetic terms are used to describe different patterns of ancestral and derived character or trait states as stated in the above diagram in association with apomorphies and synapomorphies.
* Symplesiomorphy – an ancestral trait shared by two or more taxa.
** Plesiomorphy – a symplesiomorphy discussed in reference to a more derived state.
** Pseudoplesiomorphy – a trait that cannot be identified as either a plesiomorphy or an apomorphy that is a reversal.
* Reversal – a loss of derived trait present in ancestor and the reestablishment of a plesiomorphic trait.
* Convergence – independent evolution of a similar trait in two or more taxa.
* Apomorphy – a derived trait. Apomorphy shared by two or more taxa and inherited from a common ancestor is synapomorphy. Apomorphy unique to a given taxon is autapomorphy.
** Synapomorphy/homology – a derived trait that is found in some or all terminal groups of a clade, and inherited from a common ancestor, for which it was an autapomorphy (i.e., not present in &quot;its&quot; immediate ancestor).
** &quot;Underlying synapomorphy&quot; – a synapomorphy that has been lost again in many members of the clade. If lost in all but one, it can be hard to distinguish from an autapomorphy.
** Autapomorphy – a distinctive derived trait that is unique to a given taxon or group.
* Homoplasy in biological systematics is when a trait has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages during evolution. This convergent evolution leads to species independently sharing a trait that is different from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor.
** Parallel homoplasy – derived trait present in two groups or species without a common ancestor due to convergent evolution.
** Reverse homoplasy – trait present in an ancestor but not in direct descendants that reappears in later descendants.
* Hemiplasy is the case where a character that appears homoplastic given the species tree actually has a single origin on the associated gene tree. Hemiplasy reflects gene tree-species tree discordance due to the multispecies coalescent.

<text>The 1978 [[Commonwealth Games]] were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, from 3 to 12 August, two years after the 1976 Summer Olympics was held in Montreal, Quebec. They were boycotted by Nigeria, in protest at New Zealand&#x27;s sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda, in protest at alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin. The Bid Election was held at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

This was the first Commonwealth Games where a computerized system was used to handle ticket sales. This was the first Commonwealth Games to be named &quot;Commonwealth Games&quot;, having dropped &quot;British&quot;. The Games were opened by Queen Elizabeth II for the first time since becoming Queen in 1952.

<text>Pyotr Yakovlevich Shevyryov (; June 23 [July 5], 1863 – May 8 [May 20], 1887) was a Russian revolutionary, member of Narodnaya Volya.

In 1883, Shevyrev enrolled in the University of Kharkiv and later transferred to St.Petersburg University. In the winter of 1885—1886, he organized an illegal club called &quot;Student Union&quot; (Союз землячеств, or Soyuz zemlyachestv). In the late 1886, Shevyrev and Aleksandr Ulyanov created the &quot;Terrorist Faction&quot; of Narodnaya Volya, which would be responsible for devising the attempted assassination of Alexander III on March 1, 1887. In February 1887, Shevyrev left for the Crimea due to his tuberculosis. 

Shevyrev was arrested in Yalta on March 7. On April 19, at St. Petersburg, he was sentenced to death by hanging during the Pervomartovtsi trial. He was executed at the fortress of Shlisselburg some two weeks later.

<text>The 1982 Commonwealth Games were held in Brisbane, Australia, from 30 September to 9 October 1982. The Opening Ceremony was held at the QEII Stadium (named after Elizabeth II), in the Brisbane suburb of Nathan. The QEII Stadium was also the athletics and archery events venue. Other events were held at the purpose-built Sleeman Sports Complex in Chandler.

The Chairman of the 1982 Commonwealth Games was Sir Edward Williams. The 1982 Commonwealth Games Logo was designed by Hugh Edwards. The symbol is derived from the form of a bounding kangaroo. The three bands, forming stylized A&#x27;s (for Australia), and is in colours which are common to flags of many Commonwealth countries.

The mascot for the games was also designed by Hugh Edwards and is a caricature of a kangaroo was named≈≈≈≈ Matilda. A mechanical kangaroo travelled around the stadium and winked at the crowd.

The event was officially opened by The Duke of Edinburgh and closed by Elizabeth II.

==Host selection==
Bidding for the XII Commonwealth Games was held in Montreal, Canada, at the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics. Lagos, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, and Birmingham were the bidding cities. On 14 July 1976, it was announced that Brisbane had won the rights to stage the Games after the other candidate cities withdrew bids. Sixteen years after the Brisbane Games, Kuala Lumpur hosted the 1998 Commonwealth Games, while Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

Brisbane was awarded the Games by default after being the only candidate city left at the bid election after Birmingham reversed its decision to submit an application. Nigeria&#x27;s boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal made Lagos&#x27; bid lobbying impractical. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal were plagued with cost overruns, and bidding on a sports festival anywhere in the world was not good politically.

==Participating teams==

Forty-six Commonwealth nations and territories took part in the 1982 Commonwealth Games. A total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials participated in the event. The Griffith University student dormitories in the adjoining Nathan Campus were used as athletes&#x27; villages.


==Sports==
Sports contested during the 1982 Commonwealth Games included athletics, archery, badminton, lawn bowls, boxing, cycling, shooting, swimming, diving, weightlifting and wrestling.

Table tennis and Australian rules football were demonstration sports, with the latter being demonstrated at a 6 October rematch at the Gabba of that year&#x27;s VFL Grand Final, which took place just 11 days before at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Richmond won the demonstration rematch with a score of 28.16 (184) to Carlton&#x27;s 26.10 (166).

==Ceremonies==
===Opening ceremony===
The ceremony at the QEII Stadium was held on a fine but extremely windy day. The wind was so strong that skydivers who were going to descend into the stadium were cancelled. Instead they made an entrance at the closing ceremony.

===Closing ceremony===

Elizabeth II closed the Games during a colourful ceremony, which included parachute jumpers (who had originally been also intended as part of the Opening Ceremony display) jumping and landing in a special target area within the stadium and red, white and blue balloons. Matilda the Kangaroo also winked at the Queen. Following the closing of the Games, the Queen and the Duke left the stand to be driven from the stadium. However, nobody wanted the Games to end and the Australian team formed a &#x27;guard of honour&#x27; and ran beside and behind the car in which Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were travelling, as it circled the stadium several times before finally leaving. Team members from other countries also joined in running after the royal car.

== Highlights ==

===Day 1 (1 October)===
The first event of the Games was Road Trial in cycling. England won the Gold Medal in the event, and Australia won the Silver Medal—coming second to England by only six seconds.

Other sports which were contested on the first day of competition included swimming and diving, weightlifting, shooting and bowls.

===Day 2 (2 October)===
Sports contested included swimming, diving, weightlifting, shooting, cycling, bowls and archery.

The day was marred by both Australia and Canada being disqualified in the 4 × 100 metres relay in swimming, both problems occurring during change-overs. The medals awarded for this race went to England, Scotland and New Zealand.

===Day 4 (4 October)===
Sports contested included swimming, diving, cycling, athletics, archery, hammer throwing and shooting.

The day was marred when Canada was again disqualified, this time in the 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay. Canada protested against the winners, Australia, as well as against their own disqualification.

== Aboriginal movement protests ==
The Brisbane Commonwealth Games were also noted by large-scale protests by the Aboriginal rights movement in Australia, which brought to the centre of international media attention the lack of Indigenous land rights in Australia, poor living condition and suppression of personal and political rights in Queensland in particular, and in Australia as a whole. One of the targets of the protests was Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Aborigines Act 1971&quot;, which restricted and controlled the lives of Aboriginal people in Queensland.

There were large marches on 26 September (2,000 people), 20 September (1000), and a sit-in of 104 people on 4 October. Also on that day, around 20 spectators held Aboriginal flags in the stadium during the entire program. On 7 October, about 500 people attended another protest, and 400 police arrested 260 people, including then Governor-General&#x27;s daughter, Ann Stephen. The protests were all peaceful, but police came out in force and blocked roads, making arrests under Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Traffic Act&quot;.

Activists taking part in the protests included Gary Foley and Bob Weatherall (both leaders of the protest); Billy Craigie; Lyall Munro Jnr; Ross Watson; Wayne Wharton; and Selwyn Johnson and his family. Selwyn&#x27;s brother Hedley Johnson was a musician, of the Brisbane group Mop and the Dropouts. Their song, &quot;Brisbane Blacks&quot;, written by Mop Conlon, became a kind of anthem for the protests.

Bob Weatherall, a Kamilaroi elder, is a lifelong activist, a researcher in Aboriginal history, and musical collaborator with Brisbane band Halfway

The protests, which were followed by large-scale arrests, are a significant event in the history of the Australian Aboriginal rights movement. When the Commonwealth Games returned to Australia in 2018 at the Gold Coast, it drew a series of peaceful protests.

The classic Australian film &quot;Guniwaya Ngigu (We Fight)&quot; documents the Aboriginal protest movement during the Commonwealth Games, and was directed by Madeline McGrady and Tracey Moffatt, and produced by Maureen Watson, Tiga Bayles and Madeline McGrady.

== Legacy ==
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the 1982 Commonwealth Games were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Defining Moment&quot;. Brisbane also bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics but lost to Barcelona. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on 9 December 2019 that the state will make an official bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics and Paralympics featuring venues across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. In 2021, the city won the bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.

==Medals by country==
This is the full table of the medal count of the 1982 Commonwealth Games. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC.

<text>The 1986 Commonwealth Games were held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 24 July and 2 August 1986. This was the second Commonwealth Games to be held in Edinburgh. This event served as a qualifying event for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul for the events that was contested at the Olympic Games. Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries (largely African, Asian and Caribbean states) boycotted the event because of the Thatcher government&#x27;s policy of keeping Britain&#x27;s sporting links with apartheid South Africa.

The Games were commemorated on the UK’s first-ever £2 circulating coin, which showed a Scottish thistle upon the St. Andrew’s saltire design on the reverse side of the coin.

==Organisation ==

Unlike the 1970 Games in Edinburgh, which were popular and successful, the 1986 Games are ill-famed for the wide political boycott connected with them and the resulting financial mismanagement.

==Controversies ==

In addition to the boycott, further controversy arose when it was revealed that through this much-reduced participation and the resultant decline in anticipated broadcasting and sponsorship revenues, the Organising Committee was facing a big financial black hole. The boycott ended any prospect of securing emergency government assistance. Businessman Robert Maxwell stepped in to offer funding, taking over as chairman; but although he promised to invest £2m, his contribution was just £250,000. On a budget of £14m, the Games opened with a deficit of £3m, which later grew to £4.3m, and instead of putting enough money into the event to save it, the new chairman of the Games asked creditors to forgo half the payment due to them to keep the event out of liquidation. The debt was finally paid off in 1989, with the city of Edinburgh losing approximately £500,000.

Several athletes were excluded because they breached the amateurism rules, most notably lawn bowlers Phil Skoglund from New Zealand and Willie Wood from Scotland, both of whom have competed in subsequent Games.

==Participating teams==

Due to the boycott only 27 teams from across the Commonwealth were represented at the 1986 Games.

==Boycott==

Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries (largely African, Asian and Caribbean states) boycotted the event because of the Thatcher government&#x27;s policy of keeping Britain&#x27;s sporting links with apartheid South Africa in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country and the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest turnout since Auckland 1950. Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes had appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.

==Opening ceremony==

The theme of the opening ceremony celebrated the &quot;Spirit of Youth&quot; and included 6500 Scottish schoolchildren taking part in a series of large Mass Games-style Gymnastics routines. The theme song &quot;Spirit of Youth&quot; was written by Gerard Kenny. The ceremony began on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle from which hundreds of schoolchildren ran down the Royal Mile, through Holyrood Park to Meadowbank Stadium.

<doc id="1006030" wikidata="Q7851372" url="?curid=1006030" title="Tuebrook">
<text>Tuebrook (or Tue Brook; locally ) is an area in the north-east of Liverpool, England. At the 2001 census the population was 14,490.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name may be Tew Brook, a tributary of the Alt. The brook itself is now almost entirely piped or culverted, with the last exposed section at the back of a disused cinema.

==Description==
Tuebrook includes Newsham Park, the Victorian, Grade I listed building St John&#x27;s Church, Tuebrook Market and Tuebrook Police Station, which is now closed to the public although still in use by Merseyside Police. It is part of the Parliamentary Constituency of Liverpool West Derby. A unique characteristic of the main shopping street is that all shops are on one side of the street only. This is largely due to extensive demolition during upgrading of the main road.

Tuebrook has two secondary schools nearby: West Derby School located on Mill Bank and St Francis of Assisi in Newsham Park.

==Government==
For representation to the House of Commons, the area is within the Liverpool West Derby Parliamentary constituency.

==Transport==
There are regular buses (numbers 12, 13, 15, 18, 62, 68 and variants thereof) providing services to the city centre, as well as to Aigburth, Bootle, Croxteth, Huyton and Old Swan and Stockbridge village.

The area is bisected by the A5049 West Derby Road, an east/west arterial route out of Liverpool city centre. Tuebrook also has a railway line which carries freight from Tuebrook sidings near Edge Hill to the Port of Liverpool in the north. The bridge, carrying the Canada Dock Branch over West Derby Road, used to accommodate Tue Brook railway station until 1948.

The Merseytram System (Line 1) was scheduled to run through Tuebrook prior to the abandonment of the project when funding from the Government was denied.

Tue Brook railway station used to serve the area, however the line was closed from passenger traffic in 1948. The line itself (Canada Dock Branch) is still a busy goods route. It was announced in December 2019 that Liverpool City Council had commissioned a feasibility study to consider reopening the Canada Dock Branch to passenger traffic.

<doc id="1006035" wikidata="Q14654" url="?curid=1006035" title="Unix time">
<text>Unix time is a date and time representation widely used in computing. It measures time by the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch. For example, at midnight on 1 January 2010, Unix time was 1262304000.

Unix time originated as the system time of Unix operating systems. It has come to be widely used in other computer operating systems, file systems, programming languages, and databases. In modern computing, values are sometimes stored with higher granularity, such as microseconds or nanoseconds.

== Definition ==
Unix time is currently defined as the number of non-leap seconds which have passed since 00:00:00UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970, which is referred to as the &quot;Unix epoch&quot;. Unix time is typically encoded as a signed integer.

The Unix time is exactly midnight UTC on 1 January 1970, with Unix time incrementing by 1 for every non-leap second after this. For example, 00:00:00UTC on 1 January 1971 is represented in Unix time as . Negative values, on systems that support them, indicate times before the Unix epoch, with the value decreasing by 1 for every non-leap second before the epoch. For example, 00:00:00UTC on 1 January 1969 is represented in Unix time as . Every day in Unix time consists of exactly seconds.

Unix time is sometimes referred to as &quot;Epoch time&quot;. This can be misleading since Unix time is not the only time system based on an epoch and the Unix epoch is not the only epoch used by other time systems.

=== Leap seconds ===
Unix time differs from both Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and International Atomic Time (TAI) in its handling of leap seconds. UTC includes leap seconds that adjust for the discrepancy between precise time, as measured by atomic clocks, and solar time, relating to the position of the earth in relation to the sun. International Atomic Time (TAI), in which every day is precisely seconds long, ignores solar time and gradually loses synchronization with the Earth&#x27;s rotation at a rate of roughly one second per year. In Unix time, every day contains exactly seconds. Each leap second uses the timestamp of a second that immediately precedes or follows it. 

On a normal UTC day, which has a duration of seconds, the Unix time number changes in a continuous manner across midnight. For example, at the end of the day used in the examples above, the time representations progress as follows:

When a leap second occurs, the UTC day is not exactly seconds long and the Unix time number (which always increases by exactly each day) experiences a discontinuity. Leap seconds may be positive or negative. No negative leap second has ever been declared, but if one were to be, then at the end of a day with a negative leap second, the Unix time number would jump up by 1 to the start of the next day. During a positive leap second at the end of a day, which occurs about every year and a half on average, the Unix time number increases continuously into the next day during the leap second and then at the end of the leap second jumps back by 1 (returning to the start of the next day). For example, this is what happened on strictly conforming POSIX.1 systems at the end of 1998:

Unix time numbers are repeated in the second immediately following a positive leap second. The Unix time number is thus ambiguous: it can refer either to start of the leap second (2016-12-31 23:59:60) or the end of it, one second later (2017-01-01 00:00:00). In the theoretical case when a negative leap second occurs, no ambiguity is caused, but instead there is a range of Unix time numbers that do not refer to any point in UTC time at all.

A Unix clock is often implemented with a different type of positive leap second handling associated with the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This yields a system that does not conform to the POSIX standard. See the section below concerning NTP for details.

When dealing with periods that do not encompass a UTC leap second, the difference between two Unix time numbers is equal to the duration in seconds of the period between the corresponding points in time. This is a common computational technique. However, where leap seconds occur, such calculations give the wrong answer. In applications where this level of accuracy is required, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds when dealing with Unix times, and it is often preferable to use a different time encoding that does not suffer from this problem.

A Unix time number is easily converted back into a UTC time by taking the quotient and modulus of the Unix time number, modulo . The quotient is the number of days since the epoch, and the modulus is the number of seconds since midnight UTC on that day. If given a Unix time number that is ambiguous due to a positive leap second, this algorithm interprets it as the time just after midnight. It never generates a time that is during a leap second. If given a Unix time number that is invalid due to a negative leap second, it generates an equally invalid UTC time. If these conditions are significant, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to detect them.

==== Non-synchronous Network Time Protocol-based variant ====
Commonly a Mills-style Unix clock is implemented with leap second handling not synchronous with the change of the Unix time number. The time number initially decreases where a leap should have occurred, and then it leaps to the correct time 1 second after the leap. This makes implementation easier, and is described by Mills&#x27; paper. This is what happens across a positive leap second:

This can be decoded properly by paying attention to the leap second state variable, which unambiguously indicates whether the leap has been performed yet. The state variable change is synchronous with the leap.

A similar situation arises with a negative leap second, where the second that is skipped is slightly too late. Very briefly the system shows a nominally impossible time number, but this can be detected by the TIME_DEL state and corrected.

In this type of system the Unix time number violates POSIX around both types of leap second. Collecting the leap second state variable along with the time number allows for unambiguous decoding, so the correct POSIX time number can be generated if desired, or the full UTC time can be stored in a more suitable format.

The decoding logic required to cope with this style of Unix clock would also correctly decode a hypothetical POSIX-conforming clock using the same interface. This would be achieved by indicating the TIME_INS state during the entirety of an inserted leap second, then indicating TIME_WAIT during the entirety of the following second while repeating the seconds count. This requires synchronous leap second handling. This is probably the best way to express UTC time in Unix clock form, via a Unix interface, when the underlying clock is fundamentally untroubled by leap seconds.

==== Variant that counts leap seconds ====
Another, much rarer, non-conforming variant of Unix time keeping involves incrementing the value for all seconds, including leap seconds; some Linux systems are configured this way. Time kept in this fashion is sometimes referred to as &quot;TAI&quot; (although timestamps can be converted to UTC if the value corresponds to a time when the difference between TAI and UTC is known), as opposed to &quot;UTC&quot; (although not all UTC time values have a unique reference in systems that do not count leap seconds).

Because TAI has no leap seconds, and every TAI day is exactly 86400 seconds long, this encoding is actually a pure linear count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:10TAI. This makes time interval arithmetic much easier. Time values from these systems do not suffer the ambiguity that strictly conforming POSIX systems or NTP-driven systems have.

In these systems it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to correctly convert between UTC and the pseudo-Unix-time representation. This resembles the manner in which time zone tables must be consulted to convert to and from civil time; the IANA time zone database includes leap second information, and the sample code available from the same source uses that information to convert between TAI-based timestamps and local time. Conversion also runs into definitional problems prior to the 1972 commencement of the current form of UTC (see section UTC basis below).

This system, despite its superficial resemblance, is not Unix time. It encodes times with values that differ by several seconds from the POSIX time values. A version of this system, in which the epoch was 1970-01-01T00:00:00TAI rather than 1970-01-01T00:00:10TAI, was proposed for inclusion in ISO C&#x27;s , but only the UTC part was accepted in 2011. A does, however, exist in C++20.

=== Representing the number ===
A Unix time number can be represented in any form capable of representing numbers. In some applications the number is simply represented textually as a string of decimal digits, raising only trivial additional problems. However, certain binary representations of Unix times are particularly significant.

The Unix codice_1 data type that represents a point in time is, on many platforms, a signed integer, traditionally of 32bits (but see below), directly encoding the Unix time number as described in the preceding section. A signed 32-bit value covers about 68 years before and after the 1970-01-01 epoch. The minimum representable date is Friday 1901-12-13, and the maximum representable date is Tuesday 2038-01-19. One second after 2038-01-19T03:14:07Z this representation will overflow in what is known as the year 2038 problem.

In some newer operating systems, codice_2 has been widened to 64 bits. This expands the times representable to about in both directions, which is over twenty times the present age of the universe.

There was originally some controversy over whether the Unix codice_2 should be signed or unsigned. If unsigned, its range in the future would be doubled, postponing the 32-bit overflow (by 68 years). However, it would then be incapable of representing times prior to the epoch. The consensus is for codice_2 to be signed, and this is the usual practice. The software development platform for version 6 of the QNX operating system has an unsigned 32-bit codice_2, though older releases used a signed type.

The POSIX and Open Group Unix specifications include the C standard library, which includes the time types and functions defined in the codice_6 header file. The ISO C standard states that codice_2 must be an arithmetic type, but does not mandate any specific type or encoding for it. POSIX requires codice_2 to be an integer type, but does not mandate that it be signed or unsigned.

Unix has no tradition of directly representing non-integer Unix time numbers as binary fractions. Instead, times with sub-second precision are represented using composite data types that consist of two integers, the first being a codice_2 (the integral part of the Unix time), and the second being the fractional part of the time number in millionths (in codice_10) or billionths (in codice_11). These structures provide a decimal-based fixed-point data format, which is useful for some applications, and trivial to convert for others.

=== UTC basis ===
The present form of UTC, with leap seconds, is defined only starting from 1 January 1972. Prior to that, since 1 January 1961 there was an older form of UTC in which not only were there occasional time steps, which were by non-integer numbers of seconds, but also the UTC second was slightly longer than the SI second, and periodically changed to continuously approximate the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Prior to 1961 there was no UTC, and prior to 1958 there was no widespread atomic timekeeping; in these eras, some approximation of GMT (based directly on the Earth&#x27;s rotation) was used instead of an atomic timescale.

The precise definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC is only uncontroversial when applied to the present form of UTC. The Unix epoch predating the start of this form of UTC does not affect its use in this era: the number of days from 1 January 1970 (the Unix epoch) to 1 January 1972 (the start of UTC) is not in question, and the number of days is all that is significant to Unix time.

The meaning of Unix time values below (i.e., prior to 1 January 1972) is not precisely defined. The basis of such Unix times is best understood to be an unspecified approximation of UTC. Computers of that era rarely had clocks set sufficiently accurately to provide meaningful sub-second timestamps in any case. Unix time is not a suitable way to represent times prior to 1972 in applications requiring sub-second precision; such applications must, at least, define which form of UT or GMT they use.

, the possibility of ending the use of leap seconds in civil time is being considered. A likely means to execute this change is to define a new time scale, called &quot;International Time&quot;, that initially matches UTC but thereafter has no leap seconds, thus remaining at a constant offset from TAI. If this happens, it is likely that Unix time will be prospectively defined in terms of this new time scale, instead of UTC. Uncertainty about whether this will occur makes prospective Unix time no less predictable than it already is: if UTC were simply to have no further leap seconds the result would be the same.

== History ==

The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit integer incrementing at a rate of 60 Hz, which was the rate of the system clock on the hardware of the early Unix systems. Timestamps stored this way could only represent a range of a little over two and a quarter years. The epoch being counted from was changed with Unix releases to prevent overflow, with midnight on 1 January 1971 and 1 January 1972 both being used as epochs during Unix&#x27;s early development. Early definitions of Unix time also lacked timezones.

The current epoch of 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC was selected arbitrarily by Unix engineers because it was considered a convenient date to work with. The precision was changed to count in seconds in order to avoid short-term overflow.

When POSIX.1 was written, the question arose of how to precisely define codice_2 in the face of leap seconds. The POSIX committee considered whether Unix time should remain, as intended, a linear count of seconds since the epoch, at the expense of complexity in conversions with civil time or a representation of civil time, at the expense of inconsistency around leap seconds. Computer clocks of the era were not sufficiently precisely set to form a precedent one way or the other.

The POSIX committee was swayed by arguments against complexity in the library functions, and firmly defined the Unix time in a simple manner in terms of the elements of UTC time. This definition was so simple that it did not even encompass the entire leap year rule of the Gregorian calendar, and would make 2100 a leap year.

The 2001 edition of POSIX.1 rectified the faulty leap year rule in the definition of Unix time, but retained the essential definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC rather than a linear time scale. Since the mid-1990s, computer clocks have been routinely set with sufficient precision for this to matter, and they have most commonly been set using the UTC-based definition of Unix time. This has resulted in considerable complexity in Unix implementations, and in the Network Time Protocol, to execute steps in the Unix time number whenever leap seconds occur.

== Usage ==
Unix time is widely adopted in computing beyond its original application as the system time for Unix. Unix time is available in almost all system programming APIs, including those provided by both Unix-based and non-Unix operating systems. Almost all modern programming languages provide APIs for working with Unix time or converting them to another data structure. Unix time is also used as a mechanism for storing timestamps in a number of file systems, file formats, and databases.

The C standard library uses Unix time for all date and time functions, and Unix time is sometimes referred to as time_t, the name of the data type used for timestamps in C and C++. C&#x27;s Unix time functions are defined as the system time API in the POSIX specification. The C standard library is used extensively in all modern desktop operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Unix-like systems such as macOS and Linux, where it is a standard programming interface.

iOS provides a Swift API which defaults to using an epoch of 1 January 2001 but can also be used with Unix timestamps. Android uses Unix time alongside a timezone for its system time API.

Windows does not use Unix time for storing time internally but does use it in system APIs, which are provided in C++ and implement the C standard library specification. Unix time is used in the PE format for Windows executables.

Unix time is typically available in major programming languages and is widely used in desktop, mobile, and web application programming. Java provides an Instant object which holds a Unix timestamp in both seconds and nanoseconds. Python provides a time library which uses Unix time. JavaScript provides a Date library which provides and stores timestamps in milliseconds since the Unix epoch and is implemented in all modern desktop and mobile web browsers as well as in JavaScript server environments like Node.js.

Filesystems designed for use with Unix-based operating systems tend to use Unix time. APFS, the file system used by default across all Apple devices, and ext4, which is widely used on Linux and Android devices, both use Unix time in nanoseconds for file timestamps. Several archive file formats can store timestamps in Unix time, including RAR and tar. Unix time is also commonly used to store timestamps in databases, including in MySQL and PostgreSQL.

== Limitations ==
Unix time was designed to encode calendar dates and times in a compact manner intended for use by computers internally. It is not intended to be easily read by humans or to store timezone-dependent values. It is also limited by default to representing time in seconds, making it unsuited for use when a more precise measurement of time is needed, such as when measuring the execution time of programs. 

=== Range of representable times ===


Unix time by design does not require a specific size for the storage, but most common implementations of Unix time use a signed integer with the same size as the word size of the underlying hardware. As the majority of modern computers are 32-bit or 64-bit, and a large number of programs are still written in 32-bit compatibility mode, this means that many programs using Unix time are using signed 32-bit integer fields. The maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer is , and the minimum value is , making it impossible to represent dates before 13 December 1901 (at 20:45:52 UTC) or after 19 January 2038 (at 03:14:07 UTC). The early cutoff can have an impact on databases that are storing historical information; in some databases where 32-bit Unix time is used for timestamps, it may be necessary to store time in a different form of field, such as a string, to represent dates before 1901. The late cutoff is known as the Year 2038 problem and has the potential to cause issues as the date approaches, as dates beyond the 2038 cutoff would wrap back around to the start of the representable range in 1901.

Date range cutoffs are not an issue with 64-bit representations of Unix time, as the effective range of dates representable with Unix time stored in a signed 64-bit integer is over 584 billion years, or 292 billion years in either direction of the 1970 epoch.

== Alternatives ==
Unix time is not the only standard for time that counts away from an epoch. On Windows, the codice_13 type stores time as a count of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 0:00 GMT on 1 January 1601. Windows epoch time is used to store timestamps for files and in protocols such as the Active Directory Time Service and Server Message Block.

The Network Time Protocol used to coordinate time between computers uses an epoch of 1 January 1900, counted in an unsigned 32-bit integer for seconds and another unsigned 32-bit integer for fractional seconds, which rolls over every 2 seconds (about once every 136 years).

Many applications and programming languages provide methods for storing time with an explicit timezone. There are also a number of time format standards which exist to be readable by both humans and computers, such as ISO 8601.

== Notable events in Unix time ==

Unix enthusiasts have a history of holding &quot;time_t parties&quot; (pronounced &quot;time tea parties&quot;) to celebrate significant values of the Unix time number. These are directly analogous to the new year celebrations that occur at the change of year in many calendars. As the use of Unix time has spread, so has the practice of celebrating its milestones. Usually it is time values that are round numbers in decimal that are celebrated, following the Unix convention of viewing codice_2 values in decimal. Among some groups round binary numbers are also celebrated, such as +230 which occurred at 13:37:04 UTC on Saturday, 10 January 2004.

The events that these celebrate are typically described as &quot;&quot;N&quot; seconds since the Unix epoch&quot;, but this is inaccurate; as discussed above, due to the handling of leap seconds in Unix time the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch is slightly greater than the Unix time number for times later than the epoch.

* At 18:36:57 UTC on Wednesday, 17 October 1973, the first appearance of the date in ISO 8601 format within the digits of Unix time (119731017) took place.
* At 01:46:40 UTC on Sunday, 9 September 2001, the Unix billennium (Unix time number ) was celebrated. The name &quot;billennium&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;billion&quot; and &quot;millennium&quot;. Some programs which stored timestamps using a text representation encountered sorting errors, as in a text sort, times after the turnover starting with a &quot;1&quot; digit erroneously sorted before earlier times starting with a &quot;9&quot; digit. Affected programs included the popular Usenet reader KNode and e-mail client KMail, part of the KDE desktop environment. Such bugs were generally cosmetic in nature and quickly fixed once problems became apparent. The problem also affected many &quot;Filtrix&quot; document-format filters provided with Linux versions of WordPerfect; a patch was created by the user community to solve this problem, since Corel no longer sold or supported that version of the program.
* At 23:31:30 UTC on Friday, 13 February 2009, the decimal representation of Unix time reached seconds. Google celebrated this with a Google Doodle. Parties and other celebrations were held around the world, among various technical subcultures, to celebrate the th second.

== In popular culture ==
Vernor Vinge&#x27;s novel &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot; describes a spacefaring trading civilization thousands of years in the future that still uses the Unix epoch. The &quot;programmer-archaeologist&quot; responsible for finding and maintaining usable code in mature computer systems first believes that the epoch refers to the time when man first walked on the Moon, but then realizes that it is &quot;the 0-second of one of humankind&#x27;s first computer operating systems&quot;.

<doc id="1006037" wikidata="Q5010697" url="?curid=1006037" title="Woolton">
<text>Woolton (; ) is a suburb of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England. It is an area located southeast of the city and bordered by Allerton, Gateacre, Halewood, and Hunt&#x27;s Cross. At the 2011 Census, the population was 12,921.

==Overview==
Originally a standalone village, Woolton was incorporated into Liverpool in 1913. The area was referred to as &quot;Uluentune&quot; in the Domesday Book, with the name translating as &quot;farm of Wulfa&quot;. Shortly after the Domesday survey, which was completed in 1086, Woolton became part of the Barony of Halton and Widnes. In 1189, a charge was granted by John, Constable of Chester, to the order of Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, a religious order who protected the routes for Christians on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Knights held land in Woolton for over 350 years, until it was confiscated from them in 1559 by Queen Elizabeth I. The manorial rights to Woolton passed from Queen Elizabeth to James I, who sold them to William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Woolton then passed to Isaac Green, then his daughter, then her son Bamber Gascoyne of Childwall (MP for Liverpool 1780–1796 and an ancestor of longtime &quot;University Challenge&quot; host Bamber Gascoigne), and is now owned by the Marquess of Salisbury.

Housing is primarily detached and semi-detached, although some terraces survive in Woolton Village (the centre of the suburb). Pubs in the area include The Cobden, The Elephant, The Grapes, The Victoria, and The White Horse, with more within walking distance. Other notable buildings include the Victorian public swimming baths and the public library, which was converted from a Methodist chapel but closed in 2012 as part of Liverpool City Council&#x27;s cost-cutting measures. Woolton has a number of churches, including St Mary&#x27;s (Catholic), St Peter&#x27;s (Anglican), and St James&#x27;s (Methodist). The Catholic schools St Francis Xavier&#x27;s and St Julie&#x27;s are also located in Woolton.

Hunts Cross Station is the nearest railway station on the southern boundary of Woolton, with local services on the southern route of the Manchester to Liverpool line between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Oxford Road, and also Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern Line to Liverpool Central and Southport. Liverpool South Parkway, one and a half miles to the west of Woolton, serves the same lines in addition to Crewe and Birmingham stopping services. Bus services provide connections with Liverpool John Lennon Airport, the city centre, neighbouring districts and the broader Liverpool area. Gateacre (for Woolton) also served passengers from 1879 until its closure in 1972.

All three elected councillors for the Woolton ward (Malcolm Kelly, Kris Brown, and Barbara Mace) are Liberal Democrats.

==Beatles landmarks==
Numerous sites of interest associated with the Beatles can be found in Woolton, most notably John Lennon&#x27;s childhood home at 251 Menlove Avenue and the children&#x27;s care home Strawberry Field, both of which are just one street away from each other. It is also generally believed that Lennon first met Paul McCartney during a fête at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Woolton on 6 July 1957. The churchyard additionally houses the graves of Eleanor Rigby and Lennon&#x27;s uncle, George Toogood Smith, with whom he lived at 251 Menlove Avenue for much of his childhood.

<doc id="1006061" wikidata="Q181930" url="?curid=1006061" title="Nigeria national football team">
<text>The Nigeria national football team represents Nigeria in Men&#x27;s international football. Governed by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), they are three-time Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) winners, with their most recent title in 2013. In February 2024, the Nigerian national football team was ranked 28th in the FIFA rankings. The team has qualified for six of the last eight FIFA World Cups, missing only the 2006 and 2022 editions. They have reached the round of 16 on three occasions. Their first World Cup appearance was in the 1994 edition. The team is a member of FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
After playing other colonies in unofficial games since the 1930s, Nigeria played its first official game in October 1949, while still a British colony. The team played warm-up games in England against various amateur teams including: Bromley, Dulwich Hamlet, Bishop Auckland, and South Liverpool. Nigeria&#x27;s match against Marine A.F.C. at Rossett Park drew 6,000 spectators, a record for the small ground.

===1963–1980===

Nigeria first appeared in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1963, when they were drawn in a group with Sudan, and the then United Arab Republic. They did not advance to the next stage.

The team&#x27;s first major success was a gold medal in the 2nd All-Africa games in 1973 led by captain, Victor Oduah. The team went on to achieve 3rd-place finishes in the 1976 and 1978 African Cup of Nations to follow. In 1980, with players such as Segun Odegbami and Best Ogedegbe, the team, led by Christian Chukwu, won the African Cup for the first time in Lagos.

Nigeria Olympic Men&#x27;s football team won the football event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, beating Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in the process. They were runners-up in the same event at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, losing to Argentina in a rematch of the 1996 Final of the event.

In 1984, 1988 and 2000, Nigeria reached the Cup of Nations final, losing to Cameroon. Three of the five African titles won by Cameroon have been won by defeating Nigeria. Missing out to Cameroon on many occasions has created an intense rivalry between both nations. Three notable occasions; narrowly losing out in the 1988 African Cup of Nations, qualifiers for the 1990 World Cup, and the controversial final of the 2000 African Cup of Nations where a kick taken by Victor Ikpeba during the penalty shoot-out was adjudged not to have crossed the goal-line by the referee.

The team withdrew from two African Cup of Nations between 1963 and 1974, due to political instability and in 1996. In 1976, they came back to the Cup of Nations with third-place finishes in both the 1976 and 1978 Africa Cup of Nations.

===1980–1990===
Nigeria hosted the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations and also won their first Cup of Nations&#x27; Title that year in Lagos. Ghana came out as runners-up three times and had one group stage elimination, between 1982 and 1990. They also failed to qualify for the 1986 Africa Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt.

===1992–2006===
Nigeria appeared again in the African Cup of Nations in 1992 and 1994, they finished third in 1992 and won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations, which was the second time they won the tournament. 
 
Nigeria finally reached the World Cup for the first time in 1994 after years of struggling to get there. They were managed by Clemens Westerhof. Nigeria topped their group which included Argentina, Bulgaria, and Greece. Nigeria defeated Bulgaria 3–0, lost to Argentina 1–2, and reached the second round after a 2–0 victory over Greece. In the second round, Nigeria played Italy and took the lead with a goal from Emmanuel Amunike in the 25th minute. Nigeria was within two minutes of qualifying for the quarter-finals, when Roberto Baggio scored to take the game to extra time. He also scored the eventual winning goal. The game ended 2–1 in favour of the Italians. In 1996 the team withdrew from that year&#x27;s African Cup of Nations under pressure from the country&#x27;s military dictator Sani Abacha due to the criticism received from the tournament hosts South Africa and especially its president Nelson Mandela, for the execution of Ogoni activist Ken Saro-Wiwa. Nigeria was subsequently banned from entering the 1998 African Cup of Nations.

In 1998, Nigeria returned to the World Cup alongside Cameroon, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. Optimism was high due to its manager Bora Milutinović and the return of most 1994 squad members. In the final tournament Nigeria were drawn into group D with Spain, Bulgaria, Paraguay. Nigeria scored a major upset by defeating Spain 3–2 after coming back twice from being 1–0 and 2–1 down. The Eagles qualified for the second round with a win against Bulgaria and a loss to Paraguay. The team&#x27;s hopes of surpassing its 1994 performance were shattered after a 1–4 loss to Denmark. This is currently the only World Cup that Nigeria qualified for without playing Argentina in the tournament finals.

In 2000 they returned to the Cup of Nations and were the runner-up and subsequently finished in third place at the 2002, 2004 and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations.

===2002 and 2006 World Cups===
The 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan saw Nigeria again qualify with optimism. With a new squad and distinctive pastel green kits, the Super Eagles were expected to build on its strong performances in the 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations. Nigeria was drawn into group F with powerhouses Sweden, Argentina, and England. The first game against Argentina started with a strong defense that kept the first half scoreless. In the 61st minute, Gabriel Batistuta breached the Nigerian defense to put Argentina in the lead 1–0, and Argentina would go on to win the game. Nigeria&#x27;s second game against Sweden saw them take the lead but later lose 2–1. Nigeria then drew 0–0 with England and bowed out in the first round.

Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup after finishing level on points in the qualification group with Angola, but having an inferior record in the matches between the sides.

===2008–2017===

In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, Nigeria ended their campaign in the quarter finals after losing to Ghana. They qualified for 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, hosted by Angola, but were eliminated by Ghana in the semi-finals. They failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations after ending the qualifiers with a 2–2 draw against Guinea with goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Victor Obinna.

Nigeria came back in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations hosted in South Africa; after playing through the tournament with an unbeaten run, they defeated Burkina Faso in the finals to lift the Cup for the third time. However, they did not qualify for either of the next two tournaments.

===2010 World Cup===

On 14 November 2009, Nigeria qualified for the 2010 World Cup after defeating Kenya by 3–2 in Nairobi.

Nigeria lost its opening match against Argentina 1–0 at Ellis Park Stadium following a controversial Gabriel Heinze header in the 6th minute. In its second game Nigeria led early on by a goal from Kalu Uche. A red card against Sani Kaita gave Greece the advantage. Greece scored the equaliser late in the first half and Nigeria conceded the second goal in the second half and lost the game 2–1. In their last group stage match against South Korea, Nigeria took an early lead in the 12th minute off of a great finish by Kalu Uche after a low cross from Chidi Odiah.
However, goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Chu-Young gave South Korea a 2–1 lead, which looked to be enough for South Korea to advance into the round of 16. However, Nigeria got a chance in the 66th minute, on the end of a pass from Ayila Yussuf that was fed through the South Korean defense was none other than Yakubu, once the pass found Yakubu&#x27;s foot about four yards away from the empty goal, Yakubu pushed the ball wide of the left post to leave South Korea still ahead 2–1. Three minutes later, Yakubu was able to calmly finish a penalty to knot the score at two apiece, but Nigeria was unable to score again and the match ended in a 2–2 draw. With this result, Nigeria was eliminated from the 2010 World Cup with just one point, while South Korea advanced into the round of 16 with four points. On 30 June 2010, following the team&#x27;s early exit and poor showing, the then President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan suspended the national football team from international competition for two years. This suspension put the team at risk of being banned from international football by FIFA for reasons of political interference.

On 5 July 2010, the Nigerian government rescinded its ban of the national football team from FIFA/CAF football competitions, but the sanction of suspension was applied by FIFA some three months after. On 4 October 2010, Nigeria was indefinitely banned from international football due to government interference following the 2010 World Cup. Four days later, however, the ban was &quot;provisionally lifted&quot; until 26 October, the day after the officially unrecognised players&#x27; union – National Association of Nigerian Footballers (NANF) dropped its court case against the NFF.

===2014 World Cup===

Nigeria&#x27;s campaign in the 2014 FIFA World Cup opened with a disappointing 0–0 draw against Iran. Four days later the team played their second game against Bosnia and Herzegovina. A controversial 29th-minute Peter Odemwingie goal gave Nigeria their first World Cup match win since 1998. They faced Argentina another four days later: a 3rd minute Lionel Messi goal for the opposition was followed almost instantly with an equalizer by Ahmed Musa. Messi gave Argentina the lead back just before half-time. In the second half, Musa leveled the game out again, Lionel Messi was substituted and handed over his captaincy to Marcos Rojo only for Rojo to put Argentina 3–2 ahead minutes later.

Nigeria lost the match, but still qualified for the round of 16. In the Round of 16, Nigeria faced France, an 18th-minute stabbed shot from Emmanuel Emenike saw the ball in the net, past the French goal-keeper but the goal was ruled off-side by the linesman. Nigeria held them off until the 79th minute when a cross and a Paul Pogba header gifted France the lead. An accidental own goal by Super Eagles Captain Joseph Yobo in injury time put the result beyond any doubt: Nigeria was out. This is the third time Nigeria is eliminated in the round of 16 and they were not still able to enter the Quarter-finals in the FIFA World Cup.

===2018 World Cup===
On 24 June 2016, The Confederation of African Football released the draw for the 3rd round of the World Cup qualifiers which saw Nigeria grouped in what was described as a &quot;group of death&quot;; alongside Zambia, Algeria, and Cameroon. Nigeria started their group stage matches with a 2–1 win over Zambia in Ndola and defeated Algeria 3–1 in their second match at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium. They went on to beat Cameroon 5–1 home and away in a back to back contest.

The Super Eagles of Nigeria became the first African team to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup after beating Zambia 1–0 in Uyo. On 3 June 2018, coach Gernot Rohr unveiled a 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Nigeria lost their first match of the tournament 0–2 to Croatia in Kaliningrad, before they won 2–0 in the second match against a brave Iceland, with Ahmed Musa scoring both goals. Nigeria had a huge chance to qualify to the next round as Argentina was demolished 3–0 by Croatia. Despite this advantage, they lost 2–1 in their last group stage match against Argentina, with one goal by Victor Moses. For this defeat, and followed with Iceland&#x27;s defeat to Croatia, Nigeria missed the opportunity to advance to the round of 16 and got eliminated from the tournament.

===2019 Africa Cup of Nations===
The Super Eagles started their campaign at the 2019 AFCON by defeating Burundi 1–0 in group B opening match. They went on to defeat Guinea and lost 2–0 to Madagascar in their final group stage match. The round of 16 saw the national football team of Nigeria defeating Cameroon 3–2 with goals coming from Jude Ighalo and Iwobi, they later went on to confront South Africa in the quarter-finals of the tournament. An 89th-minute header from Troost-Ekong gave Nigeria the lead over South Africa and the match ended 2–1 in favour of Nigeria. Nigeria faced Algeria in the semi-finals and were knocked out of the tournament after a 95th-minute free kick from Riyad Mahrez gave Algeria the lead. The Super Eagles later faced Tunisia in a third place match which they won 1–0 with the only goal coming from Ighalo which made him the top scorer of the tournament.

===2021 Africa Cup of Nations===
On 18 July 2019, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) released the draw for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. The Super Eagles were grouped in group L alongside Lesotho, Benin, and Sierra Leone. Nigeria started out by defeating Benin 2–1 at Uyo in their first group match and later went on to beat Lesotho 4–2 in an away match. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CAF postponed all AFCON qualifiers indefinitely. Subsequently, on 30 June 2020, CAF rescheduled the 2021 African Cup of Nations to 2022, to take place from 9 January to 6 February 2022. The qualifiers resumed on 9 November 2020.

The 2021 AFCON started on 9 January 2022, and Nigeria was the only team in the tournament to win all three group stage matches after defeating Egypt 1–0, Sudan 3–1, and Guinea-Bissau 2–0. However, Nigeria lost 1–0 in the round of 16 to Tunisia on 23 January.

=== 2022 World Cup ===
Nigeria failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 16 years, losing to Ghana on the away goals rule after drawing 0–0 in Ghana and 1–1 in Nigeria.

===2023 Africa Cup of Nations===
The Super Eagles started their campaign at the 2023 AFCON by drawing 1–1 to Equatorial Guinea in their opening group A match. They went on to defeat hosts Ivory Coast 1–0 and defeated Guinea Bissau in the same scoreline. The round of 16 saw the national football team of Nigeria defeating Cameroon 2–0 with a brace from Ademola Lookman, they later went on to defeat Angola in the quarter-finals of the tournament thanks to a first half strike from Lookman. Nigeria faced South Africa in the semi-finals. Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho scored to give Nigeria a 4–2 penalty shootout victory over South Africa. The match finished 1–1 after extra time. In the final, Super Eagles finished as runners-up, losing 2–1 to hosts Ivory Coast.

==Team image==
===Kits and crest===
The Nigeria national team has traditionally used a mostly-solid green on green primary set with white numbering, lettering, and highlights; coupled with all-white reversed secondary kits, all emblematic of the colours of the Nigerian flag. The shade of green has varied over the years. An olive drab-tinged, forest green was frequently favoured during the 1980s to the early 1990s, and jade has appeared in each of those decades as well; even harlequin has been used. Over the last decade, the team has appeared to settle on the more standard office green which most closely resembles the shade used on the flag. Nigeria&#x27;s first national teams used a solid scarlet top over white shorts and socks until the country adopted its current colours after its independence.

On 23 April 2015, Nike was announced to be the supplier of Nigeria&#x27;s kits after Adidas ended their kit contract with the NFF. Before that, Nike supplied Nigeria&#x27;s kit between 1994 and 2003.

====Kit suppliers====


====Kit deals====

Nigeria&#x27;s national team image has undergone much evolution throughout its history. Prior to independence, they were called the Red Devils due to their red topped kits. The name was changed to the Green Eagles after independence in reference to the Nigerian state flag as well as the eagle which adorns the country&#x27;s coat of arms. There had been deliberations for a while heading to the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations, where they were still called the Green Eagles, but at a reception after the tournament, the team&#x27;s name was officially changed to the &quot;Super Eagles&quot;. Today, only the senior men&#x27;s national team uses the nickname. The women&#x27;s national team is called the &quot;Super Falcons&quot;, and Nigeria&#x27;s underage male teams are nicknamed the &quot;Flying Eagles&quot; &amp; the &quot;Golden Eaglets&quot;.

===Media coverage===
The Nigerian football federation currently has an active deal with the parent company of AIT and Ray Power Radio. Internationally, Nigeria&#x27;s qualifiers and African Cup matches are regularly broadcast abroad by the multi-platform international sports network, beIN Sports and South African broadcaster SuperSport. Nigeria&#x27;s international friendlies are regularly scheduled in the UK through independent organisers are marketed to the country&#x27;s large population of Nigerian expatriates.

===Supporters===

Though the club is most notable at Nigeria&#x27;s home matches wearing green-themed embroidered outfits specific to the club along with wigs, hats and large sunglasses while dancing, singing, playing drums and trumpets, as well as carrying pom poms, culturally significant objects, inflatable beachballs, and waving flags; they have also shown a presence travelling abroad to support Nigeria in away matches. However, the club&#x27;s efforts at improving the atmosphere at Nigeria&#x27;s home and away matches are beset by funding issues, corruption and infighting. The club&#x27;s current head, Rafiu Ladipo, has drawn criticism from its membership and is under pressure to defer the leadership to one of his deputies.

A regular sight at Nigerian home matches is also their brass and percussion band, whose rendition of well-known Highlife songs provides Nigerian home matches with a unique feel. In Nigeria, these performers are occasionally conspicuous with their military uniforms or they may be members of the Football Supporters Club. A popular chant among supporters from all over the country, after a goal scored, is &quot;Oshe Baba!&quot;, which means &quot;Thank you father!&quot; in Yoruba.

==Rivalries==

===Ghana===

Many important matches have been played against various nations who have been occasional rivals. Of these nations, Ghana is widely considered Nigeria&#x27;s primary rival as the two sides have met one another more than any other opponent, as well as being two of the most successful national teams in Africa. Nigeria has enjoyed periods of success. The most notable of these periods are the early contests during the 1950s, and matches that took place in the early 2000s.FIFA lists the first official match between the two as a World Cup qualifier match in 1960. However both national teams had already engaged in competitive matches dating back to 1950. The national teams of these two West African countries were formed during the time in which both remained protectorates of the British Empire. At that time the modern-day nation of Ghana was known as the Gold Coast. Nigeria, prior to adopting the national colours of green and white, wore scarlet tops over white shorts and were known as the &quot;Red Devils&quot;. The two sides played for several rivalry and tournament cups during this period in which full international competition was barred to them. The encounter between these two teams is commonly known as the Jollof Derby.

===Cameroon===
Nigeria&#x27;s neighbours to the east, Cameroon, have also played Nigeria a number of times over the years. The teams have met three times in the final of the African Cup of Nations with Cameroon winning each time. Both carry histories of continental success and World Cup representation that is nearly unrivaled on the African continent.

Their rivalry began in 1960 and since then, Nigeria has proved to be a more dominating team, but in all three AFCON Final matches in 1984, 1988 and 2000, Cameroon prevailed over Nigeria.

Nigeria has qualified for six FIFA World Cup finals, advancing from the group stage three times (1994, 1998 and 2014), getting knocked out in the round of 16 all three times, while Cameroon has qualified eight times, advancing from the group stage only once (1990) though they made it to the quarter-finals in that edition.

===Other African nations===
There is also a number of competitive matches with Algeria dating back to the 1970s. The two sides met twice in the African Cup of Nations finals, with each nation splitting the win totals. It was a 1–1 draw in Algeria on 8 October 1993 that enabled Nigeria to claim its first World Cup berth in the 1994 edition of the tournament. Nigeria since then had an undefeated streak against Algeria, until the semi-finals of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations when Algeria prevailed over Nigeria.

Nigeria&#x27;s western neighbour, Benin, has played competitive matches with the team since the period of European colonisation when they were known as Dahomey. But with only two wins and two draws to Benin&#x27;s credit against Nigeria&#x27;s fourteen wins, and with the sides having only met six times since 1980, Benin remains a lightly regarded opponent.

===Argentina===

In five of its first six World Cup appearances, Nigeria was drawn in the group stage with three-time champion Argentina and is regarded by many fans as having fairly acquitted themselves against the footballing giant. The fixture is the most common in the competition&#x27;s history involving an African nation. All five matches have been won by Argentina, but all were by a one-goal margin (2–1 in 1994, 1–0 in 2002, 1–0 in 2010, 3–2 in 2014 and 2–1 in 2018) and have been tightly contested. To date, Nigeria has recorded two wins against Argentina&#x27;s six, with the victories occurring during friendly matches. Nigeria came close to defeating Argentina in their first meeting, during which they held a lead for some minutes of the match. This was followed by a Confederations Cup match in 1995 which saw Nigeria hold the South Americans to a 0–0 draw. Below full international level, their Olympic teams also faced off in the gold medal match in 1996 (3–2 to Nigeria), and 2008 (1–0 to Argentina). The final of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship was also played between them; both Argentina goals in their 2–1 win were scored by Lionel Messi, who would go on to find the net for the senior team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cup fixtures.

The match-up holds some importance to many Nigerian football fans who regard the challenge as an important measuring stick for the development of Nigerian football. Argentine fans for their part, typically do not regard Nigeria as a rival. Although it means less to Argentine fans, matches against Nigeria are always seen as needing to be played with caution.

==Home stadium==

The Moshood Abiola National Stadium (formerly known as National Stadium, Abuja) serves as the official home stadium of the Super Eagles. Several international matches are played in other stadiums across the country. However, since the construction of Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, most of the Super Eagles&#x27; important home matches have been played there.

<text>Fazakerley is a suburb of north Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is part of the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 16,786.

==Description==
Fazakerley is in north Liverpool; neighbouring districts include Croxteth, Gillmoss, Aintree and Kirkby. It includes Fazakerley railway station, Altcourse Prison and Aintree University Hospital.

==History==
Fazakerley takes its name from Anglo-Saxon root words—all descriptive words pertaining to land; &quot;*Fæs-æcer-lēah&quot;. This can be broken down to &quot;fæs&quot; (border or fringe), &quot;æcer&quot; (field) and &quot;lēah&quot;, meaning a wood or clearing.

In 1321, Fazakerley was described as follows: &quot;the country is extremely flat and treeless, with nothing to recommend it to the passer-by, for it seems to be a district of straight lines, devoid of any beauty&quot;. It had an area of and was separated from Walton by a brook, and from West Derby partly by Sugar Brook up to Stone bridge.

Fazakerley was formerly a township in the parish of Walton-on-the-Hill, in 1866 Fazakerley became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1921 the parish had a population of 6055.

Fazakerley was once home to a Royal Ordnance Factories plant (ROF Fazakerley), which manufactured weapons such as the Lee–Enfield rifle, Sten and Sterling submachine guns both during and after World War II.

==In television==
1983 Yorkshire Television drama &quot;One Summer&quot; was partially set in Fazakerley.

<text>Vasili Stepanovich Osipanov (&quot;Осипанов, Василий Степанович&quot; in Russian) (2.21(3.5).1861, Tomsk — 5.8(20).1887) was a Russian revolutionary and a member of Narodnaya Volya.

In 1881—1886, Osipanov was a student at the University of Kazan, where he joined the revolutionary movement. He later transferred to St.Petersburg University. In 1886, Osipanov joined the &quot;Terrorist Faction&quot; of Narodnaya Volya and, together with Aleksandr Ulyanov and others, took part in preparing the assassination of Alexander III. He was placed in charge of the bombthrowers.

Osipanov was arrested on March 1, 1887 and later executed in the Shlisselburg Fortress.

<text>The .44 Remington Magnum, also known as .44 Magnum or 10.9x33mmR (as it is known in unofficial metric designation), is a rimmed, large-bore cartridge originally designed for revolvers and quickly adopted for carbines and rifles. Despite the &quot;.44&quot; designation, guns chambered for the .44 Magnum round, its parent case, the .44 Special, and the .44 Special&#x27;s parent case, the .44 Russian all use diameter bullets. The .44 Magnum is based on the .44 Special case but lengthened and loaded to higher pressures for greater velocity and energy.

Famously called &quot;the most powerful handgun [cartridge] in the world&quot; by Clint Eastwood in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, the .44 Magnum has since been eclipsed in power by the .45 Winchester Magnum, .454 Casull, .460 S&amp;W Magnum, .475 Wildey Magnum, .480 Ruger, .50 Action Express, .500 S&amp;W Magnum, and the .500 Bushwhacker; nevertheless, due in part to its more manageable recoil, it has remained one of the most popular commercial large-bore magnum cartridges.

==Origin==
The .44 Magnum cartridge was the result of years of tuned handloading of the .44 Special. In the early 20th century, experimenters loaded the .44 Special and other large-bore handgun cartridges with heavy bullets and higher than normal powder charges to achieve superior ballistics and better hunting performance. One of these hand-loaders was Elmer Keith, a prominent writer and outdoorsman of the 20th century.

Keith settled on the .44 Special cartridge as the basis for his experimentation, rather than the larger .45 Colt. At the time, the selection of .44 caliber projectiles for hand-loaders was more varied, and the .44 Special&#x27;s brass was thicker and stronger than the dated .45 Colt case. Also, the .44 Special case was smaller in diameter than the .45 Colt case. In revolvers of the same cylinder size, this meant that the .44 caliber revolvers had thicker, and thus stronger, cylinder walls than the .45. This allowed higher pressures to be used with less risk of a cylinder failure.

Keith and his associates successfully lobbied Smith &amp; Wesson and Remington to produce a commercial version of this new high-pressure loading, along with revolvers chambered for it. Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s first .44 Magnum revolver, the precursor to the Model 29, was built on December 15, 1955, and the gun was announced to the public on January 19, 1956 for a price of US$140 (roughly $ today). Julian Hatcher (technical editor of &quot;American Rifleman&quot;) and Keith received two of the first production models. Hatcher&#x27;s review of the new Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and the .44 Magnum cartridge appeared in the March 1956 issue of the magazine. Smith &amp; Wesson produced 3,100 of these revolvers in 1956.

By the summer of 1956, Sturm, Ruger became aware of this project and began work on a single action Blackhawk revolver for the new .44 Magnum cartridge. There is a popular rumor that a Ruger employee found a cartridge case marked &quot;.44 Remington Magnum&quot; and took it to Bill Ruger, while another says a Remington employee provided Ruger with early samples of the ammunition. Ruger began shipping their new revolver in late November 1956.

The .44 Magnum case is slightly longer than the .44 Special case. This alteration was not primarily intended to increase the propellant capacity of the cartridge, but rather to prevent the far higher pressure round from being chambered in older, weaker .44 Special firearms and potentially causing injury or death to shooters.

The .44 Magnum was an immediate commercial success. The direct descendants of the S&amp;W Model 29 and the .44 Magnum Ruger Blackhawks are still in production, and have been joined by numerous other makes and models of .44 Magnum revolvers and even a handful of semi-automatic models, the first being produced in the 1960s. The film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, prominently featuring the S&amp;W M29 shooting .44 Special ammo, contributed to that model&#x27;s popularity.

Ruger introduced its first long gun, a semi-automatic carbine called the Ruger Model 44 chambered for .44 Magnum, in 1959. Marlin followed soon after with the lever action Model 1894 in .44 Magnum. Having a carbine and a handgun chambered in the same caliber is an old tradition; the .44-40 Winchester was introduced by Winchester in a lever action in 1873, and Colt followed in 1878 with a revolver in the same caliber. The .38-40 Winchester and .32-20 Winchester were also available in both carbines and revolvers, allowing the shooter to use one type of ammunition for both firearms.

Although improved modern alloys and manufacturing techniques have allowed even stronger cylinders to be made, leading to larger and more powerful cartridges such as the .454 Casull and .480 Ruger in revolvers the same size as a .44 Magnum, the .44 Magnum is still considered an exceptional weapon. In 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the .44 Magnum, Ruger introduced a special 50th anniversary Blackhawk revolver, in the &quot;Flattop&quot; style.

==Technical specifications==

The .44 Magnum fires a large, heavy bullet at a high velocity for a handgun. In its full-powered form, it produces so much recoil and muzzle blast that it is generally considered to be unsuitable for use as a police weapon. Rapid fire is difficult and strenuous on the user&#x27;s hands, especially for shooters of smaller build.

Although marketed as a .44 caliber, the .44 Magnum and its parent .44 Special are actually .429-.430 caliber. The .44 designation is a carryover from the early measurements of heeled bullets used in the late 19th century. In those times, bullet diameter typically matched the external dimension of its respective cartridge, not the interior of the round. After the .44 Russian was developed, the forefather of the .44 Special and thus the .44 Magnum, the measurement of bullet caliber was taken from inside of the cartridge, resulting in .429 caliber.

Some gun styles are more comfortable to use when shooting this caliber. Many shooters find the rounded grip shape of the single action better for handling heavy recoil than the grip shape of double-action revolvers, which have a shoulder on top of the grip. Many shooters consider the ideal type of grip for heavy recoiling guns to be the longer &quot;Bisley&quot; style single action grip, and it can be found on single actions from Ruger (models marked &quot;Bisley&quot;) and Freedom Arms, as well as many custom makers.

===Dual-purpose use===

The concept of a dual-purpose handgun/rifle cartridge has been popular since the Old West, with cartridges like the .44-40 Winchester, whose &quot;high-speed&quot; rifle loadings were precursors to magnum loads. Other dual-use rounds were the .32-20 Winchester and the .38-40 Winchester.

Some past dual-purpose cartridges, like the .44-40 Winchester, gave their manufacturers trouble when people loaded the &quot;high-speed&quot; versions designed for rifles into handguns. Since the .44 Magnum was designed from the start as a revolver cartridge, there are no such issues, and SAAMI-compliant ammunition fires from any handguns or rifles chambered for the .44 Magnum.

For a handgun cartridge, the bolt thrust is considerable at C.I.P. conform maximum loads and an important factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it.

As a rifle or carbine cartridge, the .44 Magnum is sufficiently powerful for medium-sized game, yet fits easily into a compact, lightweight package. In 1961, Ruger introduced their .44 carbine, the first .44 Magnum carbine. The lever-action Marlin Model 1894, and many other firearms are currently available in this caliber. With significantly longer barrels than revolvers and no cylinder gap (except in revolving rifles), carbines will generate a significantly higher velocity than a revolver loaded with the same ammunition. Tests with various ammunition in the Ruger Deerfield yielded a velocity of over with a bullet, comparable to the muzzle velocity out of a revolver. Loads using slow-burning powders maximize performance in both short and long barrels, with one published load generating from a revolver, and from a carbine with a bullet.

===Suitable game===
The .44 Magnum is well suited to kill animals up to elk size. With precise shot placement and deep-penetrating cartridges, it has even been used to kill the largest of game, including Cape Buffalo. Publisher Robert E. Petersen killed a record-setting polar bear with a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum. It has even been used to kill elephants with success.

In addition to beating the ballistics of the old .44-40 rifle loads, long considered a top deer cartridge, the heavy, flat-point bullets typically used in the .44 Magnum have an additional advantage. Tests performed where bullets are shot through light cover, intended to represent twigs and brush, have shown that the high-velocity, lightweight, thin-jacketed, pointed bullets used by most hunting cartridges today are easily deflected by contact with the brush. The ideal bullets for penetrating brush with minimal deflection are heavy, flat-point bullets at moderate velocities.

===Range===

The accuracy of the .44 Magnum is very good, with models from Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, and Ruger producing bullet groups of at , with most ammunition. The limiting factor of the .44 Magnum cartridge is not terminal ballistics. When fired from a revolver, a typically loaded .44 Magnum bullet will have more impact energy at than a .44 Special has at the muzzle, when fired from the same weapon. When loaded with a heavy, non-expanding bullet, the .44 Magnum will easily shoot through large game such as elk and even bison.

The limiting factor is the bullet&#x27;s trajectory: the best hunting bullets are heavy, so they are relatively slow. This means the projectile&#x27;s trajectory will drop significantly at ranges beyond ; there will be virtually zero significant drop at , so the gun&#x27;s aimed &quot;line of sight&quot; can meet the &quot;bullet&#x27;s trajectory&quot; at the same point. When drop-out at is about , the drop-out at is more than ; with a zero drop-out, the drop-out at will still measure more than . Experts limit hunting ranges to when shooting .44 Magnum cartridges, less if practical accuracy requires it.

==In popular culture==

The .44 Magnum remained mildly popular among shooters for many years after its introduction, but did not come to the attention of the general public until 1971 when it was prominently featured in the American feature film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; starring Clint Eastwood. In one of the classic lines in cinema, title character &quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan describes his Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 as &quot;the most powerful handgun in the world&quot;. Although the more powerful .454 Casull wildcat cartridge was announced in 1959, the .44 Magnum was the most powerful production cartridge until the 1980s when the first production .454 Casull revolver was produced. The .44 Magnum was also bought and used by the character Travis Bickle in the 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; during his assault on a brothel. The &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann also features a song titled &quot;The .44 Magnum is a Monster&quot;.

Demand for the Model 29 increased so much that they were selling for up to three times the suggested retail price. When the Model 29 could not be obtained, customers sought other handguns chambered in this caliber, such as the Ruger Redhawk.
