<text>Enghien-les-Bains () is a commune in the department of Val-d&#x27;Oise, France. It is located in the northern suburbs of Paris, from the centre of Paris.

Enghien-les-Bains is famous as a spa resort and a well-to-do suburb of Paris, developed in the nineteenth century around the scenic lake of Enghien. A casino, the only one in the vicinity of Paris, is located on the shores of the lake. 

==Name==
The suffix &quot;les Bains&quot; (literally &quot;the Baths&quot;) was added to the name when the &quot;commune&quot; was incorporated in 1850, to distinguish this place from the Belgian city of Enghien, near Mons, and to acknowledge the thermal baths for which Enghien-les-Bains is famous.

The name Enghien itself does refer to the Belgian city, which was a fief of the princes of Condé, a cadet branch of the French royal family, who inherited the duchy of Montmorency in 1633. In 1689 they were allowed by King Louis XIV to rename the duchy of Montmorency to be the &quot;duchy of Enghien&quot;, in order to revive the title, &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot;, which they had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, who had not legally registered the title.

The village of Montmorency (now a city) continued to be known as &quot;Montmorency&quot;, despite the official name change, but the name &quot;Enghien&quot; clung to the nearby lake and marshland that would later become the &quot;commune&quot; of Enghien-les-Bains.

==History==
Before the French Revolution, what is now Enghien-les-Bains was a lake and a marshland under the jurisdiction of Montmorency.

In 1766, a priest at the oratory of Montmorency discovered a warm sulphur spring near the lake of Enghien, and the area began to develop as a spa resort.

At the creation of the &quot;communes&quot; in 1790, during the French Revolution, the area of Enghien was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of Montmorency and divided between several communes.

In the nineteenth century, the development of Enghien led to its incorporation as a commune. The commune, which was named Enghien-les-Bains, was created on 7 August 1850 by detaching a part of the territory of Deuil-la-Barre and merging it with a part of the territory of Saint-Gratien, a part of the territory of Soisy-sous-Montmorency, and a part of the territory of Épinay-sur-Seine.

<text>Vendel is a village at Tierp Municipality in Uppland, Sweden.
The village overlooks Vendelsjön, a long inland stretch of water near the Vendel river which has its confluence with the river Fyris. Vendel was the site of an ancient royal estate, part of &quot;Uppsala öd&quot;, a network of royal estates meant to provide income for the medieval Swedish kings. A large number of archaeological finds have been found here, which have given their name to the Vendel Period.

Vendel Church (&quot;Vendels kyrka&quot;) was probably begun to be built in Romanesque style during the latter half of the 13th century. Around 1450, the church was vaulted with brick vaults. The church is most noted for its murals by Johannes Iwan who worked in Uppland during the 15th century. 
==Archaeological research==

In 1881 to 1883, several excavations by Swedish archaeologist Hjalmar Stolpe (1841–1905) revealed 14 graves in and just beyond the south-east corner of the churchyard. Several of the burials were contained in boats up to 9 m long, and they were richly furnished with arrangements of weapons (including fine swords), helmets, cauldrons and chains, beads, shields, tools etc.

The helmets from Graves 1, 12 and 14 bear close comparison to the helmet from the early 7th century ship-burial at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, England, with die-stamped plaques depicting scenes of warriors. The shield from Grave 12 at Vendel is also very comparable to the Sutton Hoo shield, and has a stamped metal strip mount which is actually die-linked to an equivalent piece at Sutton Hoo. The Vendel boats were identified by the presence of many ship-rivets, and accompanied by many animal sacrifices (mainly horses) within the burials. A later grave (Grave 3) contained an important set of bridle-mounts for a horse. These graves date between the later 6th to 8th centuries.

At Husby near Vendel there is a large mound which local tradition calls &quot;Ottarshögen&quot; from &quot;Ottar&quot; also known as Ohthere and &quot;hög&quot;, meaning mound or barrow. Ohthere is associated with the person of that same name in the epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;. An excavation in 1917 revealed the remains of a powerful man who was buried at the beginning of the 6th century, the time of Ohthere. Other graves of similar date, associated with Ohthere&#x27;s family, are at Old Uppsala.

Vendel has given its name to a period (the Vendel Age) in the Scandinavian Iron Age, and to the corresponding Vendel style in art. It has often been suggested that the Germanic Vandals, or at least their kings or rulers, were connected to the site. In this it is coupled with the name of a companion site at Valsgärde in the same region. The close comparisons with the 27-metre ship burial at Sutton Hoo show a direct connection between the armourers producing work found at the two sites, a connection central to the understanding of both. The Sutton Hoo burial is often associated with King Rædwald of East Anglia, (ruled c 599-624), who in his later reign (c 616-624) was most powerful among the rulers of the English kingdoms.

<text>NEWSru.com was a Russian independent online news site based in Moscow that was generally critical of the Russian government. Launched by Russian internet pioneer Anton Nossik in 2000, it closed in 2021 after experiencing difficulties attracting advertisers due to the site&#x27;s editorial positions.

==History==

NEWSru launched by Russian internet pioneer Anton Nossik on August, 28, 2000, with the domain name ntu.ru Yelena Bereznitskaya-Bruni replaced the initial Editor in Chief Igor Barchugov in 2001.

In 2002, the state-run OAO Gazprom Media took over NTV, and NEWSru remained part of the media empire of former NTV owner and oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky. The takeover was seen as a turning point in media freedom in post-Soviet Russia.

In 2009, Russian journalist Maria Yulikova described NEWSru as one of the leading independent news sources in Russia.

The site primarily operated as a news aggregator.

In May 2021, the site announced it would close for &quot;economic reasons&quot; due to a difficulty with attracting advertisers because the site did not follow the editorial line of pro-Kremlin state media. Editor-in-Chief Yelena Bereznitskaya said &quot;In the current situation, we realized that we won’t find funding in the near future for what we love and know how to do — objective news.&quot; The site&#x27;s staff planned to continue to focus on newsru.co.il, its Russian-language Israeli offshoot.

== Headquarters and team ==
NEWSru was based in Moscow, but its editorial team and location were kept secret. The network had two foreign editions: a website in Israel started in December 2005 (newsru.co.il), and a Ukrainian edition based in Kyiv, which was discontinued in March 2017.

Chief editor Olga Leni admitted that the Ukrainian publication had been subsidized for the entire 10 years of its existence, and the site had never been self-supporting. Other former employees agreed that the site was closed due to a pro-Ukrainian pronouncement on the conflict in Donbas.

<text>Eskom Hld SOC Ltd or Eskom is a South African electricity public utility. Eskom was established in 1923 as the Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM) (). Eskom represents South Africa in the Southern African Power Pool. The utility is the largest producer of electricity in Africa, and was among the top utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and sales. It is the largest of South Africa&#x27;s state owned enterprises. Eskom operates a number of notable power stations, including Matimba Power Station and Medupi Power Station in Lephalale, Kusile Power Station in Witbank, Kendal Power Station, and Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in the Western Cape Province, the only nuclear power plant in Africa.

The company is divided into Generation, Transmission and Distribution divisions, and together Eskom generates approximately 95% of electricity used in South Africa, amounting to ~45% used in Africa, and emits 42% of South Africa&#x27;s total greenhouse gas emissions. By releasing 1.6 million tons of sulphur dioxide into the air in 2019, Eskom is also the largest emitter of sulphur dioxide in the power industry in the world. Eskom has periodically implemented rolling blackouts since January 2008, a practice ascribed to basic dereliction of duty by former president Thabo Mbeki. Implementation of new generating capacity during this period was fraught with delays and cost overruns which brought the utility to the brink of bankruptcy. In 2019, it was announced that Eskom was to be split up into three distinct nationally owned entities due to huge debts and poor reliability of supply.

At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, a deal was announced for developed countries to fund South Africa&#x27;s transition from coal power to renewable energy. However, employment in the mining sector threatens this transition.

== History ==

Prior to the establishment of Eskom, the provision of electricity was dominated by municipalities and private companies. The city of Kimberley was one of the first users of public electricity when it installed electric streetlights in 1882 to reduce crime at night. This was followed by Cape Town in 1895 with the construction of the Graaff Electric Lighting Works to power 775 street lights.

Eskom was founded by the Electricity Act of 1922 which allowed the South African Electricity Control Board to appoint Hendrik Johannes van der Bijl as chairman. The company changed its name by combining the two acronyms in its previous name (ESCOM and ESKOM) in 1987 to become known as Eskom.

The Electricity Act stated that Eskom could only sell electricity at cost and was exempted from tax with the firm initially raising capital through the issuing of debentures, later issuing state-guaranteed loans instead. The coal-fired Congella Power Station in Durban and Salt River Power Station in Cape Town were the first power stations built by Eskom, both completed in mid-1928.

One of Eskom&#x27;s first power plants was a coal-fired 128 MW station in Witbank, completed in 1935 to provide power to the mining industry. The plant was built and run in partnership with the privately owned Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company, which owned a number of other power plants across the country. Thanks to state support, Eskom was able to buy out the Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company in 1948 for £14.5 million (roughly equivalent to £2.55 billion in 2017). Following World War 2, South Africa experienced power shortages that led to Eskom negotiating power saving agreements with the mining industry in June 1948.

=== First expansion period: 1960-1994 ===

From 1960 to 1990 Eskom increased its installed power production capacity from 4,000 MW to 40,000 MW so as to keep up with rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 70s. During the same period, Eskom established a nationwide 400 kV power network. During this period the company built a number of large standardised coal-fired power plants that could produce power at very low cost due to the large economies of scale. These plants were known colloquially as &quot;six-packs&quot; for the 6 large generator units they were designed to accommodate.

In 1974 the company was instructed to start work on Koeberg nuclear power station to both provide power to Cape Town and help facilitate the South African government&#x27;s nuclear program.

In 1981 Eskom was involved in one of its first large financial scandals when its Assistant Chief Accountant was caught embezzling R8 million from the company (equivalent to roughly R164.37 million in 2018).

During the 1970s the company controversially sought to increase electrical tariffs to help pay for its large expansion plans. Due to its financial situation, the government appointed Dr. W.J. de Villiers to chair a commission that recommended a number of financial and organisational changes for the company to adopt. This led to the company abandoning its no-profit objective and to raise funds by taking out international loans. The number of Eskom employees was also reduced from 66,000 to 60,000 in the late-1980s.

=== Post-1994 election period: 1994-2007 ===
Following democratic elections in 1994 and the start of the Mandela government the company changed focus to electrification of previously neglected residential homes and to provide low cost electricity for economic growth. Following the passing of the 1998 Eskom Amendment Act government&#x27;s powers to influence company policy and investment decisions were greatly expanded. Due to the South African government&#x27;s attempted privatisation of Eskom in the late 1990s during the administration of President Thabo Mbeki, Eskom requests for budget to build new stations were denied. After leaving the presidency, Mbeki would later state in December 2007 that this was an error, resulting in adverse affects for the South African economy.
=== Load shedding and second expansion: 2007-present ===

In February 2006, Eskom announced &quot;load shedding&quot; in the Western Cape province, due to issues experienced by Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant this continued until June 2006. In January 2008, Eskom controversially introduced load shedding nationally (rolling blackouts) based on a rotating schedule, in periods where short supply threatened the integrity of the grid. Demand-side management has focused on encouraging consumers to conserve power during peak periods in order to reduce the incidence of load shedding. Following the national power shortage in 2007, Eskom embarked on an aggressive electricity production expansion programme during the administration of President Jacob Zuma. The Zuma administration decided to focus expansion efforts on building additional large scale six-pack coal-fired power plants.

In 2016, Eskom stated it intended to pursue a nuclear solution to the country&#x27;s energy shortage. According to projections from late 2016, the use of nuclear power would provide over 1000GW of power by 2050. In preparation, the company launched a training program for 100 technicians, engineers and artisans that would certify them as nuclear operators. In January 2018, Eskom&#x27;s acting chief financial officer stated that the company could not afford a new build, following a 34% drop in interim profits due to declining sales and increasing financing costs. The government stated it would proceed with the plan but more slowly.

In 2017, Eskom was the focus of a major corruption scandal involving the Gupta family and the administration of then President Jacob Zuma.

The National Energy Regulator of South Africa denied an application by Eskom to increase electricity tariffs by a future 19.9% for the financial year 2018/19. The regulator instead granted a 5.2% increase and gave a list of reasons for the refusal to grant higher tariffs that the South African newspaper Business Day stated painted &quot;a picture of inefficiency, inaccurate forecasting and cost overruns&quot; at the power utility. Part of the refusal was the finding that Eskom had 6,000 more employees than needed, costing the company R3.8 billion annually.

In February 2019, shortly after the announcement by government that the company would be broken up, Eskom initiated another round of emergency load shedding. Eskom stated that the 2019 load shedding was initiated due to breakdowns at power stations as well as the depletion of water and diesel resources. Other reasons cited included legacy issues from state capture corruption, coal availability, and that new power plants such as Medupi and Kusile were not yet operational. Corruption during the Zuma administration had been noted as a major factor in the cost overruns and long delays in completing Medupi and Kusile power plants that had a knock-on effect leading to the 2019 power shortages. The power shortage and related troubles at Eskom was blamed as a significant contributing factor to a 3.2% decline in GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019, prompting fears of a recession in 2019. In December 2019, President Ramaphosa, deputy president David Mabuza and Ministers Gwede Mantashe and Pravin Gordhan met with Eskom&#x27;s board and management to discuss about the energy crises. The president attributed the recent blackouts partly to sabotage at the Tutuka Power Station in Mpumalanga which had caused a loss of 2000 megawatts of electricity, and announced measures to bring an end to load-shedding. Mantashe and Gordhan were tasked with presenting ways to increase electricity capacity to the cabinet, which would include self-generation. Amid the crisis, Jabu Mabuza resigned from his post as chairperson of Eskom&#x27;s board in January 2020. Between March and July 2020 the power supply was stable due to reduced demand during the COVID-19 lockdown, but on 12 July a new round of level 2 load shedding began due to the breakdown of generating units. During the winter of 2023, the country experienced Stage 6 blackouts, shaving a projected 2% off the country&#x27;s GDP. During the worst period, power cuts lasted 12 hours a day. The company faces theft of materials for resale, sabotage to force repairs to be made at corruptly inflated prices, and assassination attempts which may be motivated by the attempt to replace coal with renewable sources.

===Logos===
Eskom&#x27;s logo has been an integral symbol of the company since its founding. For a brief period in 1986 Eskom had no logo when it was moving away from the company&#x27;s original logo of stylised letters spelling &quot;ESC&quot; within a circle to the more contemporary version with a blue shield with a stylised lightning bolt in its centre. The 1987 logo was replaced in 2002 with its current logo that replaced the shield with a circle but otherwise kept the logo as it was.

== Restructuring efforts ==
In December 1998, a white paper prepared by the Department of Minerals and Energy recommended that the government restructure Eskom into separate generation and transmission businesses. Although the report predicted that this action would improve power supply and reliability, it was never enacted.

In February 2019, these plans were resurrected during the State of the Nation address. President Ramaphosa announced that the government would be splitting Eskom up into three new state-owned entities focusing on generation, transmission and distribution. This was done so as to better manage the serious operational and financial problems facing the company. By the time of the speech Eskom had a total debt burden of R419 billion (US$30.8 billion) and was entering a death spiral whereby there was not enough revenue to make debt repayments.

In a February 2019 briefing, the Department of Public Enterprises stated that Eskom was &quot;technically insolvent&quot; and would not be able to operate past the next three months if it did not receive additional loans. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni then announced in his 2019 budget speech that government would be providing a R69 billion rand (US$5 billion) bail-out to Eskom over a three-year period so as to stabilise the company&#x27;s serious financial situation.

=== Transmission ===

As result of the restructuring, a transmission entity called the National Transmission Company of South Africa (NTCSA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eskom, would be given its own board, by 31 March 2020 in which the transmission legal entity would be responsible for hearing legislative amendments in accordance to government law. This new transmission entity would involve up to 6,000 people that are responsible of setting up thousands of kilometres of &quot;wires&quot; and transmission lines that would ensure electricity from the power stations to where power is needed. As part of the Transmission Development Plan (TDP) for 2020–2029 Eskom has plans to increase its transmission infrastructure by approximately 4,800 km of extra high voltage transmission lines, and over 35,000 MVA of transformer capacity over the next 10 years. This new outline of reconstructing Eskom comes from new regulatory guidelines from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) to publish an annual TDP report. 

In July 2023, NERSA approved for the National Transmission Company of South Africa to operate a transmission system in South Africa. In September 2023, NERSA approved the remaining trading and import/export licences.

=== COSATU response ===
In response to feared job losses resulting from the breakup the trade union COSATU organised a national strike and called for a moratorium on retrenchments in the private and public sectors. This caused to the apparent abandonment of the government&#x27;s company breakup and restructuring plans. In July 2019 the outgoing Eskom CEO announced that Eskom had entered a &quot;death spiral&quot; and highlighted the need for the company to restructure. Following the appointment of André de Ruyter as Eskom CEO trade unions National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity stated that they would fight any government restructuring efforts that might result in job losses.

In December 2019 COSATU suggested that money be used from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to reduce Eskom&#x27;s debt from around R450 billion to more manageable levels. In return COSTATU proposed a number of conditions that included keeping workers employed. The trade union Solidarity was strongly apposed to the COSATU proposal arguing that it put the pensions of public employees at risk. The country&#x27;s second biggest trade union, the Federation of Unions of South Africa, was also skeptical of COSATU&#x27;s proposed plan.

===Job losses===
Between 2020 and 2021, two thousand employees lost their jobs at the power utility. 6000 more jobs are reportedly at risk in order for the company to continue operating.

==Installed capacity==
===Subscribers===

Eskom – the only electricity utility in the country – has 16,789,974 subscribers in South Africa, comprising about one-third of the population.

=== Fossil-fuelled power stations ===
=== Renewable and nuclear power stations ===

===Future projects===
Eskom has a number of planned infrastructure projects to further expand electrical production.
* Tubatse Pumped Storage Scheme – 1500MWe
* Wind 500 – 550MWe
* Tasakoolo Wind farm 200 – 200Mwe

=== Investment in renewables ===
As of October 2019 Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd issued a tender to introduce 20 three-phase KW inverters and mountains structures. These structures are planned to distribute power to four power plants, and would introduce Eskom into the solar energy market. The African Investment Forum has announced that it has raised over $40.1 billion in investment into developing new infrastructure, related to renewable energies. This is aimed to help distance itself from Eskom coal power plants, and to focus more on wind and solar developments. The African investment forum is backed up by corporate organizations and lenders, private donors, and the African Development Bank.

These new inverters would be align with South Africa&#x27;s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).

==== South Africa&#x27;s integrated resource plan ====
The IRP supports a diverse energy mix with policy aimed to help aim to meet the need of South Africa&#x27;s energy goals. The Integrated Resource Plan supports electrical infrastructure developments with an aim focused on renewable energy sources. These new investments are directed towards more high efficiency, low emission standards with an emphasis on solar technologies in which 6,000 MW of new Solar PV capabilities and 14,400 MW of new wind power technologies. With renewable energies, the IRP plans to increase its investment in hydro-electric power.

==== Investment in renewables, hydro, wind, solar ====
With failing power plants and coal not working as a viable solution, progress towards a greener future is in sight for South Africa. In agreement to the Paris Agreement, South Africa needs to reduce its carbon emission and cut-back from being dependent on Coal. There is new US$11 Billion Green-Energy Initiative aimed at the development of solar and wind. This new initiative would allow loans to Eskom and below commercial rates on conditions that it would accelerate its closure of power plants and to start building renewable energy structures. This plan takes the steps in moving away from coal, and investing in alternative methods that better suit their needs for the future.

=== Other infrastructure ===
In 2002, Eskom was issued a network operator licence. It embarked on a $100 million project installing fibre optic cables on 10 000 kilometres of its existing power lines for the purpose of real-time monitoring of the electrical network; 80% consists of all-dielectric lashed cabling and 10% All-dielectric self-supporting cabling. It currently has the sixth most ASN prefixes of all registered network operator licensees.

== Corporate affairs ==
In 2011 eight out of ten Eskom board members were controversially sacked by the Zuma administration. From 2015 to 2017 the Zuma administration appointed Ben Ngubane as chairperson of the board. Brian Molefe was appointed by Zuma as Eskom CEO from April 2015 to November 2016. Molefe and Ngubane&#x27;s tenure was controversial for their involvement with the Gupta family and for allegedly allowing the company to become a vehicle for state capture. Ngubane also controversially attempted to blacklist newspapers perceived as unfriendly to Eskom. During parliament&#x27;s state capture inquiry in 2017 former Eskom chairperson Zola Tsotsi (2012–2015) testified that Gupta family member Tony Gupta made threats against Tsotsi allegedly stating that Tsotsi will lose his job as he was not &#x27;helping&#x27; the Guptas. In December 2016, Matshela Koko, former head of generation for Eskom, was named as acting CEO. He resigned in 2018 after being implicated in awarding contracts to a company linked to his stepdaughter. Koko, along with his wife and stepdaughter, were arrested in October 2022. In early 2018, following the establishment of the Ramaphosa government, multiple members of the Eskom board and executive team were replaced by government due to allegations of corruption and mismanagement.

Phakamani Hadebe was made acting CEO and director of Eskom in May 2018 as part of President Ramaphosa&#x27;s replacement of the company&#x27;s executive team. A year into his term as CEO Hadebe resigned citing poor health and the difficult circumstances of the job. His resignation sparked a debate amongst political parties over the difficult state of managing the financially strained state owned company as well as the lack of political cover he was given to deal with labour unions and tackle corruption.

Six months after Hadebe&#x27;s departure, former Nampak Chief Executive André de Ruyter was appointed CEO of Eskom. De Ruyter&#x27;s appointment was criticised by the EFF and factions within the ANC who instead wanted a black CEO appointed to the position. De Ruyter resigned in December 2022 after repeated attacks on him by Gwede Mantashe, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy partly due to de Ruyter&#x27;s advocacy for replacing coal with renewables as an energy source. News24 reported that he was not given the support needed to succeed in the position. Shortly after the announcement that de Ruyter would be leaving Eskom it was reported that he survived a poisoning attempt after he unknowingly drank a cup of coffee at his office that was laced with cyanide.

=== Financials ===

In 2018 and 2019 Eskom&#x27;s negative financial situation became serious as costs started exceeding income and the company started experiencing trouble raising money. For 72 hours between 26 March and 29 March 2019 it was reported that Eskom had run out of funds thereby threatening to negatively impact the broader South African economy. The situation was alleviated once Eskom secured a R3 billion commercial loan which was paid back on 2 April after the Reserve Bank disbursed R5 billion to Eskom through an emergency provision. In July 2019 Eskom announced a loss of R20.7 billion due to the cost of servicing high levels of debt, the increased cost of primary energy and unpaid municipal debts.

==== Debt ====
In late 2016, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Global Ratings downgraded Eskom&#x27;s credit rating further into subinvestment grade cutting its long-term credit rating to BB – two levels below the investment threshold. By 2017 increasing levels of debt and corruption scandals affecting the company has led investment bank Goldman Sachs to declare Eskom as being the &quot;biggest risk to South Africa’s economy.&quot; The company had R413 billion in debt and planned to raise an additional R340 billion (US$26 billion) by 2022 thereby representing eight percent of South Africa&#x27;s GDP. R218.2 billion of the company&#x27;s debt consist of government guarantees. Exacerbating the company&#x27;s financial situation was a recorded R3 billion worth of irregular expenditures in 2017.

On 28 March 2018 Moody&#x27;s Investors Service downgraded Eskom&#x27;s credit rating to B2 from B1 stating that it was concerned with &quot;the lack of any tangible financial support for the company in the February state budget&quot;.

On 24 November 2020, Moody&#x27;s further downgraded Eskom&#x27;s long-term credit rating to Caa1. This places Eskom&#x27;s credit within the &quot;speculative grade&quot; of investment, with a &quot;very high credit risk&quot;.

Due to the company&#x27;s large size and important role as the region&#x27;s primary energy producer President Ramaphosa stated that Eskom was &quot;too big to fail&quot; as the reason why government had to continue to fund it despite its serious financial situation.

In February 2023, with debt sitting at R423 billion, the South African government announced that, subject to approval from existing debt holders, it would be providing support worth R254 billion, including interest payments for the following three years and three capital payments of R78-billion in 2023/24, R66 billion in 2024/25 and R40-billion in 2025/26, with the intention to reduce Eskom&#x27;s overall debt to R300 billion.

===== Chinese debt =====
In July 2018 it was announced that Eskom had taken out a R33 billion loan from the Chinese government owned China Development Bank. The loan conditions were controversially not made public with accusations that it was an example of debt-trap diplomacy by China. During the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state corruption a senior Eskom executive stated that an additional R25 billion loan from the China-based company Huarong Energy Africa was improperly and controversially taken out by Eskom. After the loan had been issued Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza stated to the Zondo Commission that Eskom would not be repaying the Huarong loan due to irregularities and corruption involved in the issuing of the loan.

== Controversies ==

=== Municipal debts ===
A number of South African municipalities are in significant arrears in paying Eskom for electricity supplied to them. The large amount owed to Eskom has caused significant controversy given the state utilities financial difficulties and repeated periods of load-shedding. By January 2020 South African municipalities owed Eskom a total of roughly R43 billion (equivalent to US$2.88 billion). This had increased to R49.1 billion by July 2022.

==== Soweto ====
The single largest South African municipality to owe Eskom for unpaid electricity is the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in which Soweto owes R13 billion to R16.4 billion in 2019. In response, Eskom initiated a process of cutting off electricity to debtors in the city, which resulted in violent public protests. The city has a history of non-payment dating back to the 1980s when non-payment was used as a form of non-violent protest against apartheid era policies. This is thought to have cultivated a culture of non-payment.

=== Zimbabwe Power Exports ===
300MW of power are exported to Zimbabwe in a deal valued at US$2 million a month.
At the end of November 2019 it was revealed that Zimbabwe owed $22 million in debt to Eskom (about 11 months in areas). Despite statements that Eskom continues to supply Zimbabwe during scheduled blackouts, electricity is only supplied if Eskom does not need it.

=== Power shortage: 2007 - ongoing ===

In the later months of 2007, South Africa started experiencing widespread rolling blackouts as supply fell behind demand, threatening to destabilise the national grid. With a reserve margin estimated at 8% or below, such &quot;load shedding&quot; is implemented whenever generating units are taken offline for maintenance, repairs or re-fuelling (in the case of nuclear units). From February 2008 to November 2014 blackouts were temporarily halted due to reduced demand and maintenance stabilization. This drop in demand was caused by many of the country&#x27;s mines shutting down or slowing to help alleviate the burden.

Load shedding was reintroduced in early November 2014. The Majuba power plant lost its capacity to generate power after a collapse of one of its coal storage silos on 1 November 2014. The Majuba power plant delivered approximately 10% of the country&#x27;s entire capacity and the collapse halted the delivery of coal to the plant. A second silo developed a major crack on 20 November causing the shut down of the plant again, this after temporary measures were instituted to deliver coal to the plant.

In 2016, Eskom said that unplanned outages had been reduced. In May 2016, former president Jacob Zuma said assurances had been given to him by Eskom management.

In June 2018, there was Stage 1 load shedding along with a strike over wages.

In February 2019, a new round of load shedding began due to the failure of coal burning boilers at some power stations due to poor quality coal. This resulted in long running periods of level 4 load shedding across the country in mid-March 2019, including night-time load shedding and promised to report back. The situation at Eskom and resulting energy crisis became a political issue during the 2019 South African general elections.

==== Sabotage ====
In December 2019, load shedding reached a new high as Eskom introduced stage 6 load shedding for the first time. Cyril Ramaphosa faced criticism as his departure for Egypt was announced shortly after the move to stage 6. He returned early to address the problem, meeting on 11 December with the Eskom board. Ramaphosa then announced that there had been an element of sabotage involved, leading to the loss of 2000MW capacity. Ramaphosa faced criticism on social media, with many blaming incompetence rather than sabotage.

On 19 November 2021, Eskom announced that an initial forensic investigation found evidence that recent damage to a coal conveyor at Lethabo was the result of deliberate sabotage. Steel supports had been severed, causing a power supply pylon to collapse. In a media briefing, de Ruyter commented that the matter had been referred to the Hawks for further investigation. In May 2022 the Minister for Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, reported to Parliament that additional incidents of cables being cut intentionally by saboteurs, rising theft at its power plants, and corruption around the supply of fuel oil, had greatly worsened the energy crisis and Eskom&#x27;s ability to resolve it.

=== Corruption ===

==== 2017 corruption scandal ====

Eskom was forced to suspend its chief financial officer Anoj Singh in July 2017 when the Development Bank of South Africa threatened to recall a R15 billion loan if no action was taken against Eskom officials (including Singh) who were involved in corruption allegations involving the Gupta family. In September 2017, Minister for Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, instructed Eskom to take legal action against firms and individuals involved; ranging from Gupta family-owned consultancy firm Trillian Capital Partners Ltd. and consultancy firm McKinsey to Anoj Singh and acting chief executive Matshela Koko.

A report compiled by Eskom and G9 Forensic found that the two consulting firms including Gupta owned Trillian made R1.6 billion (US$120 million) in fees with an additional R7.8 billion made from future contracts. An investigation done by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism found that the Gupta family had received contracts worth R11.7 billion from Eskom to supply coal between 2014 and 2017. With pressure for Eskom to sign the first coal supply contracts with Gupta-owned entities being applied on the state-owned firm by then President Jacob Zuma. In 2019 South African Special Investigating Unit launched an investigation into corruption related to the construction of the Medupi and Kusile power stations as a cause of repeated construction delays and project cost increases; this led to the investigation of 11 contractors for allegedly stealing R139 billion (US$9.13 billion) from the projects. In 2019, two senior Eskom managers and two business people were charged with fraud and corruption related to the construction of the Kusile power station.

In January 2020 South African Minister for Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, stated that cost overruns and corruption during the construction of Medupi and Kusile power stations was an important reason for the dramatic increase in Eskom electricity prices.

==== 2019 Deloitte consulting lawsuit ====
In October 2019, Eskom&#x27;s chairman Jabu Mabuza filed a court affidavit at the Johannesburg High Court to recover R207 million in consulting fees from the consulting firm Deloitte. The affidavit alleged that Eskom executives had improperly awarded two consulting contracts to the consulting firm Deloitte. According to Eskom, in one contract awarded to Deloitte, Deloitte proposed a fee of R88.8-million while the competing bids from other firms were for R14.6-million and R13.3-million. In the other contract, Deloitte&#x27;s bid was R79.1-million, while the other bids were for R16-million and R9.1-million.

In March 2020, Deloitte agreed to pay back R150 million of the R207 million sought by Eskom. However, in a joint statement, it denied being part of any corruption, and that they acknowledged that there were technical irregularities in the process of awarding the contracts.

In April 2020, Deloitte told AmaBhungane that the managing director for Deloitte Africa&#x27;s advisory division Thiru Pillay and the lead consultant on the Eskom contract Shamal Sivasanker had resigned effective 31 March 2020 for their roles in the Eskom event.

In November 2021, Eskom announced that it had appointed Deloitte as its next external auditor, as its contract with Grant Thornton was expiring at the end of that month.

==== 2023 de Ruyter interview ====

In late February 2023 then Eskom CEO André de Ruyter gave a controversial interview with E.tv during which he stated that Eskom was losing roughly R1 billion (US$53.9 million) a month due to theft and corruption. De Ruyter attributed this to the presence within Eskom of four criminal syndicates and went on to state that a senior - although unnamed - ANC MP was involved and that government did not have the political will to resolve the situation. This resulted in de Ruyter&#x27;s immediate resignation on 22 February 2023 from his position as CEO amidst criticism from the ANC. The Daily Maverick quoted an intelligence report that named the four criminal syndicates within Eskom as &quot;the Presidential Cartel, the Mesh-Kings Cartel, the Legendaries Cartel and the Chief Cartel.&quot;

=== Price increases ===
Eskom took out a number of loans to construct the additional capacity and significantly increased electrical tariffs by an average of 22% a year between 2007 and 2015 to in an attempt to offset costs. In 2019 Eskom controversially applied to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) to increase tariffs by an additional 45% over the proceeding three years arguing that it needs the increase in revenue to avoid a debt induced death spiral. Eskom was controversially granted a 13.8% increase by NERSA in March 2019. The South African civil society Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) stated that by 2019 Eskom&#x27;s electrical tariffs had increased by 500% over the previous 11 years. Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity stated that the increased tariffs will exacerbate urban poverty negating increases to South Africa&#x27;s basic income grant.

Eskom have again applied to NERSA for an urgent 17% increase in tariffs for 2019/2020 in an attempt to make up a R27.323 billion shortfall, Eskom is citing lower returns due to lower sales volumes as main reason for needing this price hike. The lower sales volumes is directly related to load shedding and Eskom&#x27;s failure to maintain capacity. The price hike application is open for public participation until 20 January 2020. In NERSA has opposed an Eskom application to receive an additional R69 billion government bailout whilst Eskom is challenging NERSA&#x27;s denial of an additional price increase for 2020/21 of 16% instead of the 8.1% price increase already approved by NERSA. During court proceedings with NERSA Eskom stated that this finances might collapse triggering a debt crisis for the South African government that has guaranteed Eskom&#x27;s debt. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has stated that corruption and cost overruns during the construction of Medupi and Kusile power stations has resulted in a fourfold increase in electricity prices.

An additional increase of 20.5% was approved by NERSA and announced by Eskom to take effect from 1 April 2022. This price raise was criticized by the mayor of Cape Town, Geordin Hill-Lewis as damaging to the economy and requested that it not be implemented. Eskom has a proposal before the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to hike electricity prices by a rumoured 44% for the 2024/2025 financial year The state-owned enterprise has applied for total revenues of R446bn for the 2026 financial year, R495bn for the 2027 financial year and R537bn for the 2028 financial year.

<text>:&quot; This page is about a sandstone in northern England. For the census-designated place in Arizona see Rough Rock, Arizona&quot;

The Rough Rock is a widespread unit of coarse sandstone which is a prominent landscape-forming feature in the Peak District and Pennines of northern England. It is assigned by geologists to the Yeadonian sub-stage of the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous period.

It is the most extensive of all of the sandstones of the Millstone Grit Group occurring throughout the Peak District, South and West Pennines and extending northwards into the central and northern Pennines.

It originated as a sheet of deltaic deposits spread across most of the Pennine Basin associated with major rivers flowing from the north and northeast.

<doc id="998156" wikidata="Q643546" url="?curid=998156" title="Haze">
<text>Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates suspended in air obscure visibility and the clarity of the sky. The World Meteorological Organization manual of codes includes a classification of particulates causing horizontal obscuration into categories of fog, ice fog, steam fog, mist, haze, smoke, volcanic ash, dust, sand, and snow. Sources for particles that cause haze include farming (stubble burning, ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, windy weather, volcanic activity and wildfires.
Seen from afar (e.g. an approaching airplane) and depending on the direction of view with respect to the Sun, haze may appear brownish or bluish, while mist tends to be bluish grey instead. Whereas haze often is considered a phenomenon occurring in dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon in saturated, humid air. However, haze particles may act as condensation nuclei that leads to the subsequent vapor condensation and formation of mist droplets; such forms of haze are known as &quot;wet haze&quot;.

In meteorological literature, the word &quot;haze&quot; is generally used to denote visibility-reducing aerosols of the wet type suspended in the atmosphere. Such aerosols commonly arise from complex chemical reactions that occur as sulfur dioxide gases emitted during combustion are converted into small droplets of sulfuric acid when exposed. The reactions are enhanced in the presence of sunlight, high relative humidity, and an absence of air flow (wind). A small component of wet-haze aerosols appear to be derived from compounds released by trees when burning, such as terpenes. For all these reasons, wet haze tends to be primarily a warm-season phenomenon. Large areas of haze covering many thousands of kilometers may be produced under extensive favorable conditions each summer.

==Air pollution==
Haze often occurs when suspended dust and smoke particles accumulate in relatively dry air. When weather conditions block the dispersal of smoke and other pollutants they concentrate and form a usually low-hanging shroud that impairs visibility and may become a respiratory health threat if excessively inhaled. Industrial pollution can result in dense haze, which is known as smog.

Since 1991, haze has been a particularly acute problem in Southeast Asia. The main source of the haze has been smoke from fires occurring in Sumatra and Borneo which dispersed over a wide area. In response to the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, the ASEAN countries agreed on a Regional Haze Action Plan (1997) as an attempt to reduce haze. In 2002, all ASEAN countries signed the Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, but the pollution is still a problem there today. Under the agreement, the ASEAN secretariat hosts a co-ordination and support unit. During the 2013 Southeast Asian haze, Singapore experienced a record high pollution level, with the 3-hour Pollutant Standards Index reaching a record high of 401.

In the United States, the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) program was developed as a collaborative effort between the US EPA and the National Park Service in order to establish the chemical composition of haze in National Parks and establish air pollution control measures in order to restore the visibility of the air to pre-industrial levels. Additionally, the Clean Air Act requires that any current visibility problems be addressed and remedied, and future visibility problems be prevented, in 156 Class I Federal areas located throughout the United States. A full list of these areas is available on EPA&#x27;s website.

In addition to the severe health issues caused by haze from air pollution, dust storm particles, and bush fire smoke, reduction in irradiance is the most dominant impact of these sources of haze and a growing issue for photovoltaic production as the solar industry grows. Smog also lowers agricultural yield and it has been proposed that pollution controls could increase agricultural production in China. These effects are negative for both sides of agrivoltaics (the combination of photovoltaic electricity production and food from agriculture).

=== International disputes ===

==== Transboundary haze ====

Haze is no longer just a confined as a domestic problem. It has become one of the causes of international disputes among neighboring countries. Haze can migrate to adjacent countries in the path of wind and thereby pollutes other countries as well, even if haze does not first manifest there. One of the most recent problems occur in Southeast Asia which largely affects the nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In 2013, due to forest fires in Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas became shrouded in a pall of noxious fumes dispersed from Indonesia, that brings a smell of ash and coal for more than a week, in the country&#x27;s worst environmental crisis since 1997.

The main sources of the haze are Indonesia&#x27;s Sumatra Island, Indonesian areas of Borneo, and Riau, where farmers, plantation owners and miners have set hundreds of fires in the forests to clear land during dry weather. Winds blew most of the particulates and fumes across the narrow Strait of Malacca to Malaysia, although parts of Indonesia in the path are also affected. The 2015 Southeast Asian haze was another major crisis of air quality, although there were occasions such as the 2006 and 2019 haze which were less impactful than the three major Southeast Asian haze of 1997, 2013 and 2015.

==Obscuration==
Haze causes issues in the area of terrestrial photography and imaging, where the penetration of large amounts of dense atmosphere may be necessary to image distant subjects. This results in the visual effect of a loss of contrast in the subject, due to the effect of light scattering and reflection through the haze particles. For these reasons, sunrise and sunset colors and possibly the sun itself appear subdued on hazy days, and stars may be obscured by haze at night. In some cases, attenuation by haze is so great that, toward sunset, the sun disappears altogether before even reaching the horizon.

Haze can be defined as an aerial form of the Tyndall effect therefore unlike other atmospheric effects such as cloud, mist and fog, haze is spectrally selective in accordance to the electromagnetic spectrum: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more, and longer (red/infrared) wavelengths are scattered less. For this reason, many super-telephoto lenses often incorporate yellow light filters or coatings to enhance image contrast. Infrared (IR) imaging may also be used to penetrate haze over long distances, with a combination of IR-pass optical filters and IR-sensitive detectors at the intended destination.

<text>Valsgärde or Vallsgärde is a farm on the Fyris river, about three kilometres north of Gamla Uppsala, the ancient centre of the Swedish kings and of the pagan faith in Sweden. The present farm dates from the 16th century. The farm&#x27;s notability derives from the presence of a burial site from the Swedish Vendel Age (part of the Iron Age (c. 550–793) and the Viking Age); it was used for more than 300 years. The first ship burial is from the 6th century and the last graves are from the 11th century.

==Excavation==

The site was found and excavated by archaeologists in the 1920s, and before this similar graves had only been found at Vendel, which gave its name to this period of the Scandinavian Iron Age. The graves are princely, and are almost identical to ones found in England, at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia dated probably to 610–635. There are several theories about the identities of those buried, ranging from the Ynglings (Scylfings) to powerful warriors within the Leidang system, or local strongmen who had enriched themselves through trade due to the area&#x27;s strategic position between the fjord of Mälaren and the important region of Tiundaland. There are so many rich graves that it is likely that most of them were royalty.

<text>The Lado Enclave (; ) was a leased territory administered by the Congo Free State and later by the Belgian Congo that existed from 1894 until 1910, situated on the west bank of the Upper Nile in what is now South Sudan and northwest Uganda. Its capital was the town of Lado.

==History==
Traditionally the home of the Lugbara, Kakwa, Bari, and Moru peoples, the area became part of the Ottoman-Egyptian province of Equatoria, and was first visited by Europeans in 1841/42, becoming an ivory and slave trading centre. Lado, as part of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, came under the control of the Khedivate of Egypt and in 1869 Sir Samuel Baker created an administration in the area, based in Gondokoro, suppressed the slave trade and opened up the area to commerce.

Charles George Gordon succeeded Baker as Governor of Equatoria in 1874 and noting the unhealthy climate of Gondokoro, moved the administrative centre downstream to a spot he called Lado, laying the town out in the pattern of an Indian cantonment, with short, wide and straight streets, and shady trees. Gordon made the development of primary industry in Lado a priority, with the start of commercial farming of cotton, sesame and durra and the introduction of livestock farming. Although Gordon stationed over three hundred soldiers throughout the region his efforts to consolidate Egyptian control over the area were unsuccessful and when he resigned as governor in 1876, only Lado and the few garrison settlements along the Nile could be considered administered.

Emin Pasha was appointed as governor to replace Gordon and began to build up the region&#x27;s defences and developed Lado into a modern town, founding a mosque, Koranic school and a hospital, so by 1881 Lado boasted a population of over 5000 tokuls (round mud huts common to the region).

Russian explorer Wilhelm Junker arrived in the Lado area in 1884, fleeing the Mahdist uprising in the Sudan, and made it his base for his further explorations of the region. Junker wrote complimentarily of Lado town, in particular its brick buildings and neat streets.

During the Mahdist rule of the region, Lado was allowed to fall into disuse but Rejaf was made into a penal settlement.

==Congo Free State rule==

British desire for a Cape to Cairo railway led them to negotiate with the Congo Free State to exchange the area that became known as the Lado Enclave for a narrow strip of territory in eastern Congo between Lakes Albert and Tanganyika. These negotiations resulted in the 1894 British-Congolese Treaty, signed on 12 May, under which the British leased all of the Nile basin south of the 10° north latitude to King Leopold II of the Belgians, sovereign of the Congo Free State, for the period of his lifetime. This area, called the Lado Enclave, linked the Congo with the navigable Nile.

The treaty also dictated that the whole of the Bahr-el-Ghazal (with the exception of the Lado Enclave) be ceded to the Congo State during the lifetime of King Leopold &quot;and his successors&quot;. The British knew that the Congo Free State would be unable to occupy Lado &quot;for some time&quot;.

French concern about Leopold&#x27;s aspirations in Africa led to the 1894 Franco-Congolese Treaty, signed on 14 August, in which Leopold was forced to renounce all right to occupy north of the 5° 30&quot; north latitude in exchange for French acceptance of Leopold&#x27;s ownership of Lado. However, it was not until 1896 that Leopold had the resources to assemble an expedition to the enclave; &quot;an expedition which was without doubt the greatest that nineteenth century Africa had ever seen&quot;, under Baron Dhanis. The official plan was to occupy the enclave, but the ultimate aim was to use Lado as a springboard to capturing Khartoum to the north and control a strip of Africa from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Dhanis&#x27; expedition mutinied in 1897.

Later in 1897, troops of the Congo Free State under Louis Napoléon Chaltin attempted to physically take control of the enclave. Chaltin&#x27;s forces reached the Nile at the town of Bedden in the enclave in February 1897 and defeated the Mahdists in the Battle of Rejaf. This consolidated Léopold&#x27;s claim to the Upper Nile, but although he had instructed Chaltin to continue on towards Khartoum, Chaltin did not have the forces to do so, and instead chose to heavily fortify Lado (which had ceased to exist under the Mahdists), Rejaf, Kiro, Loka, and Yei, and occupied Dufile.

By 1899, the British Government was claiming that the Congo State had not fulfilled its obligations of the Anglo-Congolese Treaty and therefore had no right to claim the Bahr-el-Ghazal. At the same time the convention was signed, the Congo State forces had occupied Rejaf, and by a tacit understanding, the State was permitted to remain in occupation of the Lado Enclave. &quot;The Bahr-el-Ghazal has never ceased to be British, and any extension of the sphere of influence of the Congo State beyond the limits of the Lado Enclave, without the express sanction of the British Government is a wholly unjustifiable, and indeed, filibustering proceeding.&quot;

In 1899, Leopold wanted to annul the Franco-Congolese Treaty, allowing him to gain more territory but the British opposed it, claiming that &quot;serious consequences&quot; would occur if Leopold attempted to expand the enclave&#x27;s borders.

In January 1900, some bored officials who had decided to explore the swamps beyond the Lado border were found by a British patrol. British officials believed this to be an official sortie and considered sending a military expedition to the enclave.

Kiro had been the location of the British residence in the region but following the move to Congo Free State rule, a post (also called Kiro) was established a few kilometres north of the Lado Enclave&#x27;s Kiro on the west bank of the Nile. However, in April 1901 it was discovered that this post lay within the enclave&#x27;s territory and a new British post was created across the river at Mongalla. The British were quick to populate and arm Mongalla, with a British Inspector, police officer, two companies of the Sudanese battalion under a British officer and a gunboat stationed there.

In 1905, the strategic importance of the Lado Enclave became clear enough for the British to consider offering Leopold a small part of the Bahr-el-Ghazal in exchange for the enclave. As part of this offer, the British agreed to remove their troops from the area while Leopold considered the offer. However, instead of considering, Leopold immediately ordered his troops to occupy the now vacant military posts, which was seen as a &quot;futile and disastrous outbreak of Leopold&#x27;s lust for short-term advantages. Its inevitable result was a sharp British order to Congolese forces to retreat southwards, followed by the closing of the Nile to Congolese transport.&quot;

In May 1906 the British cancelled the lease of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, although Leopold refused to evacuate the region until the promised railway between the Lado Enclave and the Congo frontier was built.

The Lado Enclave was important to the Congo Free State as it included Rejaf, which was the terminus for boats on the Nile, as the rapids there proved a barrier to further travel. Rejaf was the seat of the commander, the only European colonial official within the enclave, who were in place from 1897 to June 1910. Efforts were made to properly defend Lado against any possible incursion by another colonial power, with twelve heavy Krupp fort guns installed in November 1906.

However, there continued to be uncertainty in the enclave with the knowledge that the enclave would revert to British rule upon Leopold&#x27;s death. As a result, the Congo Free State was unable to create an effective government, leading to civil unrest within the enclave.

There were also rumours of gold deposits in Lado which led to great interest in the region in the early years of the twentieth century.

==Geography==

The enclave had an area of about , a population of about 250,000 and had its capital at the town of Lado which is near to the modern-day city of Juba. Under the 1894 Anglo-Congolese Treaty, the enclave&#x27;s territory was dictated as &quot;bounded by a line starting from a point situated on the west shore of Lake Albert, immediately to the south of Mahagi, to the nearest point of the frontier defined in paragraph (a) of the preceding Article. Thence it shall follow the watershed between the Congo and the Nile up to the 25th meridian east of Greenwich, and that meridian up to its intersection by the 10th parallel north, whence it shall run along that parallel directly to a point to be determined to the north of Fashoda. Thence it shall follow the thalweg of the Nile southward to Lake Albert, and the western shore of Lake Albert to the point above indicated south of Mahagi.&quot;

A landlocked territory, it was bordered on the north by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan province of Bahr-el-Ghazal and on the east by the Nile. The shifting sandbanks of the Nile led to islands on the border of the enclave and the Sudan regularly created or destroyed and made navigability difficult.

Described variously as &quot;a small muddy triangle along the Nile, ... a chain of desolate mudforts&quot; and &quot;shaped like a leg of mutton&quot;.

Lado was the largest town in the enclave, while Yei, a fortified military station on the Yei River, was considered the second most important town. The northernmost post was Kiro, on the west bank of the Nile nineteen kilometres above the British post at Mongalla, while Dufile, Ismailia and Wadelai were other settlements. English traveler Edward Fothergill visited the Sudan around 1901, basing himself at Mongalla between Lado to the south and Kiro to the north, but on the east shore of the river. By his account &quot;Kiro, the most northern station of the Congo on the Nile, is very pretty and clean. Lado, the second station, is prettier still&quot;. However, he said that although the buildings were well made, they were too closely crowded together.

While a large percentage of its population were Indigenous inhabitants, many Bari left the enclave, escaping Congo Free State rule, and settled on the eastern (Sudanese) shore of the Nile.

The enclave was an area of seismological activity, particularly around Rejaf (which means &quot;earthquake&quot; in Arabic). A fault line runs as a notable escarpment west of Rejaf south to Lake Albert, and while no major tremors occurred during the existence of the Lado Enclave, there was a noticeable earthquake in the region, centered on Rejaf, on 21 May 1914, which destroyed or damaged most of the buildings in the town.

===Fauna and flora===
The enclave was well known for its enormous herds of elephants which drew big-game hunters from around the world. Starting about six weeks after Leopold&#x27;s death in December 1909, from the years 1910 to 1912, hunters arrived in great numbers and shot thousands of elephants before Sudanese officials were able to take control of the area. One of the most prolific was the Scottish adventurer W. D. M. Bell.

Hippopotami were described as having been &quot;extremely numerous and particularly obtrusive&quot; in the enclave but their presence had dropped to almost zero during the enclave&#x27;s existence.

In 1912, renowned naturalist Dr Edgar Alexander Mearns travelled through the enclave as part of his expedition through eastern Africa searching for new fauna, and reported a new subspecies of Temminck&#x27;s courser within the enclave.

Tsetse flies were common in the enclave and African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness), the medical condition that can occur as a result of a tsetse fly bite, led to a number of fatal cases recorded in the enclave.

Malaria was the most common disease in the region, with about 80 per cent of the sickness in the neighboring Bahr El Ghazal due to malaria. Those suffering from malaria also faced Blackwater fever, whereby red blood cells burst in the bloodstream, releasing hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels and into the urine, frequently leading to kidney failure.

Captain Harry Ranken, who would later be awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in World War I, was posted to the enclave in 1911 and 1914 as a member of the Sudan Sleeping Sickness Commission, where he was based in Yei and researched methods of treatment for sleeping sickness and yaws. He was due to return to the enclave in 1915 to complete his research but died from shrapnel wounds in France while serving on the front line.

===Weather===

The seasons in the Lado Enclave were similar to neighboring regions of East Africa, whereby there were two seasons, with the dry season occurring from December to February and the wet season from March to November, although daily rain storms usually did not occur until June.

The temperature was comparatively cool, and the temperature was said to &quot;very seldom rise&quot; to .

==Economy==

The economy of the Lado Enclave was based on ivory and rubber. As a small region, the enclave&#x27;s trading ability was small, although a lively trading community of &quot;Egyptians, Copts and Greeks&quot; was recorded. Cotton, alcohol and utensils were the most popular items traded into the enclave.

Neither the Congo Free State nor the Sudanese introduced money taxation, preferring instead to collect grain and livestock as taxation.

==Incorporation into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan==

On 10 June 1910, following Leopold&#x27;s death, the district officially became a province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, with British Army veteran Captain Chauncey Hugh Stigand appointed administrator. In 1912 the southern half of the Lado Enclave was ceded to Uganda, then a British protectorate. However, in reality, following Leopold&#x27;s death and the subsequent withdrawal of Belgian colonial troops, British authorities neglected to administer the area, leaving the enclave to become a &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;. Ivory hunters moved in and shot almost all of an estimated herd of 2000 elephants resident in the enclave, netting the hunters large profits.

In 1912 Captain Harry Kelly of the British Royal Engineers was sent to the region to adjust the Sudan-Uganda border, with the plan to grant Uganda a southern part of the enclave, which Uganda could more easily administer, and in return to transfer part of northern Uganda to the Sudan, thereby placing all navigable parts of the Nile under Sudanese control. This was achieved on 1 January 1914 when Sudan formally exchanged part of the enclave for a stretch of the Upper Nile. The area of the Lado Enclave integrated into Uganda was renamed West Nile, best known as the ancestral home of Idi Amin.

Later Gondokoro, Kiro, Lado and Rejaf were abandoned by the Sudanese government, and no longer appear on modern maps.

==The Lado Enclave in popular culture==

Although the Lado Enclave was a small, remote area in central Africa, it captured the imagination of world leaders and authors, becoming a byword for an exotic region, and was used as a setting for their stories.

Winston Churchill travelled through the enclave, declaring it &quot;present(ed) splendid and alluring panoramas&quot;.

Lord Kitchener travelled to Lado for hunting, and shot a large white rhinoceros considered a &quot;splendid trophy&quot;, with the horn being &quot;some twenty seven inches long&quot; and the rhinoceros standing six feet tall.

Additionally, the Lado Enclave was also a popular attraction for the wealthy classes, with reports stating that &quot;still more exhilarating was to be taken to the Lado Enclave, East Africa&#x27;s equivalent to the badlands&quot;.

The enclave was the site of &quot;the last big elephant hunt on the continent&quot;, as dozens of hunters from around the world converged on the enclave over the years 1907 to 1909, killing several thousand elephants. The publicity from this hunt and the resulting public outrage led to the beginnings of the conservation movement.

In his novel &quot;Elephant Song&quot;, Wilbur Smith refers to the slaughter of elephants in the Lado Enclave following the withdrawal of the Belgian colonial service in 1910, Ernest Hemingway, in his novel &quot;True at First Light&quot;, references the enclave as a wild place while the 1936 story &quot;The Curse of Simba&quot;, refers to the enclave as the possible locale of the legendary Elephants&#x27; graveyard.

<text>Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America&#x27;s Race to the Moon is a 1994 book written by Mercury Seven astronaut Alan Shepard, with NBC News correspondent Jay Barbree and Associated Press space writer Howard Benedict. Astronaut Donald K. &quot;Deke&quot; Slayton is also listed as an author, although he died before the project was completed and was an author in name only; astronaut Neil Armstrong wrote the introduction.

==Miniseries==
The book was turned into a four part television documentary miniseries that aired on TBS in the United States in 1994. The miniseries was narrated by Barry Corbin (as Slayton) and featured interviews with several American astronauts as well as a few Russian cosmonauts. Slayton died before the miniseries completed production in 1993 and the miniseries is dedicated to his memory.

<text>Alfred Day Hershey (December 4, 1908 – May 22, 1997) was an American Nobel Prize–winning bacteriologist and geneticist.

== Early years ==
Hershey was born in Owosso, Michigan to Robert Day and Alma Wilbur Hershey. He earned a B.S. in chemistry in 1930, and Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1934 from Michigan State University. Shortly after, Hershey accepted a faculty position at Washington University in St. Louis, serving as an instructor of bacteriology and immunology from 1934 to 1950.

== Bacteriophage research ==
At Washington University, Hershey worked closely with department head Jacques Bronfenbrenner to investigate bacteriophages, or phages—viruses that infect and replicate inside bacteria. Hershey&#x27;s work on the factors impacting the virus&#x27; ability to infect its targets brought him to the attention of fellow phage researchers Max Delbrück and Salvador Luria.

=== The Phage Group ===
In 1943, Delbrück invited Hershey to Vanderbilt University to discuss his phage research. Together, with Luria, they would form the core of an informal network of researchers called &quot;the Phage group&quot;. Three years later, Hershey and Delbrück would independently discover that different strains of bacteriophage can both exchange genetic material when infecting the same bacterial cell. This process results in hybrid phages containing genetic material from both sources, which Hershey referred to as &quot;genetic recombination&quot;.

Hershey left Washington University in 1950 for the Department of Genetics of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, a predecessor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Two years later, he and Martha Chase would conduct the famous Hershey–Chase, or &quot;Waring Blender&quot; experiment. Their work confirmed that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material of life.

== Later years and death ==
In 1962, Hershey was named director of the Department of Genetics, a position he held until his retirement in 1970. He would live on the grounds of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) for the rest of his life.

Hershey&#x27;s work with bacteriophage would earn him a share of the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Delbrück and Luria, &quot;for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses.&quot;

Although officially retired from scientific research, Hershey would continue to pursue new projects. In 1971, he edited &quot;The Bacteriophage λ&quot;, an extensive volume on the subject, published by CSHL Press that same year. In 1981, Hershey became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

Hershey died from congestive heart failure on May 22, 1997 at his home in Laurel Hollow, New York. He was 88 years old. At the time, he was survived by his wife Harriet Davidson (1918–2000) and their only child, Peter Manning Hershey (1956–1999).

Following his death, Frank Stahl, a member of The Phage Group, wrote: &quot;The Phage Church, as we were sometimes called (see Phage group), was led by the Trinity of Delbrück, Luria, and Hershey. Delbrück&#x27;s status as founder and his &quot;ex cathedra&quot; manner made him the pope, of course, and Luria was the hard-working, socially sensitive priest-confessor. And Al (Hershey) was the saint.&quot;

<doc id="998187" wikidata="Q2887710" url="?curid=998187" title="The Dover Boys at Pimento University">
<text>The Dover Boys at Pimento University; or, The Rivals of Roquefort Hall (also known as The Dover Boys) is a 1942 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on September 19, 1942. The cartoon is a parody of the Rover Boys, a popular juvenile fiction book series of the early 20th century.

It is one of the first cartoons to make extensive use of limited animation, as well as other techniques that would only be more broadly popularized in the 1950s. Animation historian Michael Barrier writes: &quot;Is &quot;The Dover Boys&quot; the first &#x27;modern&#x27; cartoon? …Chuck Jones stylized the animation in this cartoon in a way that anticipated what several consciously modern studios like UPA would be doing a decade later.&quot;

In 1994, the cartoon was voted No. 49 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

==Plot==
The scene opens upon Pimento University (&quot;good old &quot;), and the school anthem is sung in a 1910s barbershop style. The narrator then introduces the three Dover brothers: athletic oldest brother Tom, thin middle child Dick, and portly, curly-haired youngest brother Larry. &quot;A gay outing at the park has been planned by the merry trio, and they are off to fetch &#x27;their&#x27; fiancée, dainty Dora Standpipe, at Miss Cheddar&#x27;s Female Academy, close by.&quot;

The Dover Boys are watched by the nefarious Dan Backslide. &quot;The former sneak of Roquefort Hall&quot;, his feelings for Dora are summed up in his comment, &quot;How I love her! … (father&#x27;s money!)&quot; Backslide then steals a conveniently placed, unoccupied runabout, which he uses to kidnap an oblivious Dora while she and the Dover Boys are playing hide-and-seek, spiriting her away to a remote mountain lodge. However, Backslide soon discovers that, despite appearances, Dora is anything but dainty; she proceeds to administer a sound thrashing to the villain, all the while acting the damsel in distress—crying for help and pounding on the door (with the locks on her side) and on Backslide—until he is himself crying out for help from Tom, Dick, and Larry.

&quot;An alert young scout&quot; witnesses Dora&#x27;s captivity, and sends a distress signal via semaphore, which reaches the Dover Boys via telegram. The Dover Boys race to the scene, and punch the barely conscious Backslide. Just as the boys prepare to punch Backslide again, he collapses to the floor, and accidentally punch each other unconscious at the same time, falling on top of Backslide in a stack. Dora is then escorted away by an odd grey-bearded man in a nineteenth-century bathing suit and sailor&#x27;s cap who was a running gag throughout the cartoon, appearing periodically to interrupt the story by shuffling across the screen to the tune of Ed Haley&#x27;s &quot;While Strolling Through the Park One Day&quot;. He and Dora proceed to shuffle off into the sunset as the cartoon concludes with a silent film-era iris out.

==Production==

According to Jones, Schlesinger and the Warner Bros. studio executives were less than pleased when they screened &quot;The Dover Boys&quot; because of the extensive use of limited animation and drybrush smears, and the executives went through the process of attempting to fire him despite the fact that the studio wanted him to abandon his Disney-like animation. A replacement for Jones could not be easily found due to labor shortages stemming from World War II, so he was kept aboard. The short is one of the earliest examples of limited animation being used, and was &quot;wholly unlike the animation of contemporary films&quot;.

From time to time throughout the cartoon, the Boys lapse into various renditions of their &quot;alma mater&quot;, bearing resemblance to &quot;The Rose of No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; and George Cooper and Henry Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Genevieve&quot;: &quot;Pimento U, Oh sweet P.U., thy fragrant odor scents the air&quot; etc.

The entire cartoon is filled with puns on the Rover Boys series: the occurrences of the names Pimento, Cheddar, and Roquefort reflect the Rover Boys&#x27; old school of Colby Hall; Tom, Dick and Larry borrow their names from Tom, Sam and Dick Rover (as well as the generic names Tom, Dick and Harry), Dora Standpipe is named after Tom Rover&#x27;s fiancée Dora Stanhope, and Dan Backslide is named after Rover Boys villain Dan Baxter.

Although voice credits from Warner Bros. cartoons are not easy to find beyond Mel Blanc (who, using more or less his normal voice, portrays Dan Backslide and the telegram delivery boy), it is assumed that John McLeish voiced the part of the narrator (he performed a similar role as the stately, unctuous narrator on several Goofy shorts for the Disney studio). The voice of Tom Dover was performed by long-time Termite Terrace writer Tedd Pierce, who also provided the story. Vocal harmonies were provided by &quot;The Sportsmen Quartet&quot;, from Jack Benny&#x27;s radio program. Dora was voiced by Marjorie Tarlton. Dan Backslide&#x27;s character design was a caricature of Jones&#x27; animator Ken Harris. McLeish also narrated the cartoon &quot;The Rocky Road to Ruin&quot; of the Color Rhapsody series from Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems, adding to the similarity between it and &quot;The Dover Boys&quot;.

The cartoon&#x27;s district limited animation style would be adopted as something of a house style by the studio UPA; animators who worked on this short, including Robert Cannon and Rudy Larriva, would later work at UPA.

==Legacy==
The characters Tom, Dick, and Larry later made cameo appearances (voiced respectively by Jon Bauman, Jeff Bennett and Rob Paulsen) on the 1990s Fox and WB network series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, alongside Slappy Squirrel in &quot;Frontier Slappy&quot;, while singing discrediting lyrics about Daniel Boone (voiced by Jim Cummings) until they get fired by him, the Warners in &quot;Magic Time&quot;, and in &quot;Wakko&#x27;s Wish&quot;. A short clip of this cartoon is featured in the opening credits of &quot;Less Than Hero&quot;, an episode of another Fox TV show, &quot;Futurama&quot;. They also appeared cheering in the stands late in the 1996 animation/live-action movie &quot;Space Jam&quot;. A segment of the cartoon is featured briefly in an episode of &quot;Agent Carter&quot; where it is used as part of a subliminal messaging tool of the Black Widow program.

With the advent of the Internet, the short gained newfound attention from younger generations, in part because it is one of the few Warner Bros. shorts from that era that fell into the public domain, although it has seen releases from MGM/UA Home Video and Warner Home Video.

In 2018, to mark the short&#x27;s 76th anniversary, a collaborative effort of over 90 independent animators recreated the short scene for scene with each animator drawing in their own style. The reanimated collaboration, titled &quot;The Dover Boys Reanimated Collab!&quot;, was curated by animator Josh &quot;Zeurel&quot; Palmer and was released on August 27, 2018, on YouTube, receiving nearly three million views.

<text>The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is one of the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It was established in order to increase economic activity in Asia and the Far East, as well as to foster economic relations between the region and other areas of the world.

The commission is composed of 53 Member States and nine Associate members, mostly from the Asia and Pacific regions. In addition to countries in Asia and the Pacific, the commission&#x27;s members includes France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The region covered by the commission is home to 4.1 billion people, or two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population, making ESCAP the most comprehensive of the United Nations&#x27; five regional commissions.

== History ==
The commission was first established by the Economic and Social Council on 28 March 1947 as the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) to assist in post-war economic reconstruction. Its main mandate was to &quot;initiate and participate in measures for facilitating concerted action for the economic reconstruction and development of Asia and the Far East.&quot;

On 1 August 1974, the commission was renamed to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) by the Economic and Social Council to reflect both the economic and social aspects of the Commission&#x27;s work, as well as geographic location of its members.

== Member states ==
There are a total of 53 full ESCAP member states and nine associate members, four of the member states are not geographically located in Asia or Oceania.

=== Full member states ===
The following countries are the full member states of the commission:

<text>Willy Lauwers, also known as &#x27;Rupske&#x27; Lauwers, (16 April 1936 – 12 April 1959) was a professional cyclist. He was born in Hemiksem, Belgium.

Lauwers owned his nickname to the way he moved on his bicycle like a caterpillar (&quot;rups&quot; in Dutch), rocking and wriggling. In addition, thanks to his agility on the bike, he managed to maneuver through the smallest gaps in the peloton. As the son of former cyclist Stan Lauwers, he was born to become a cyclist. In 1957, at the age of 21, he won the Six Days of Antwerp together with Reginald Arnold and Ferdinando Terruzzi. In the same year he was also the best in Leuven, Oudenaarde, Moerbeke and in Sint-Jansteen, the Netherlands. He seemed to have a great career, both on the track and on the road.

He died from serious injuries suffered following a fall at the Tirador velodrome in Palma de Majorca, during a race behind motors. Lauwers, while proceeding at a speed of over 70 km per hour, suddenly lost his balance and fell on the track and was subsequently hit by the motorbike of the rider Gomila who was following him a short distance away. The unfortunate cyclist was rushed to hospital and died shortly afterwards. More than 10,000 people attended his funeral in Hemiksem.

Since 2002, the G&quot;rote Prijs Rupske Lauwers&quot;, a cycle race in Hemiksem is organized to honor him. A memorial plaque was inaugurated there in 2022, in a street named &quot;Rupske Lauwerslaan&quot;.

<doc id="998226" wikidata="Q7134183" url="?curid=998226" title="Paradise, New Zealand">
<text>Paradise is a rural locality in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. It lies on the eastern side of the Dart River / Te Awa Whakatipu at the head of Lake Wakatipu, close to the settlement of Glenorchy.

The surrounding area is used for sheep and cattle farming. The locality has also been used as a setting in films and television.

==Art, entertainment, and media==
===Films===
*The locality was used during filming of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, wherein it represented Parth Galen and parts of Lothlórien, specifically the area which the Fellowship first enters. 
*It was also used in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy, for scenes of the exterior of Beorn&#x27;s house.

===Television===
*The locality was used as the setting for much of the BBC miniseries &quot;Top of the Lake,&quot; although filming of the latter took place in the nearby town of Glenorchy.

==Origin of the name==
A.W. Reed recorded that the locality was first known as Paradise Flat, and that a popular (but not universally accepted) view attributes the name to an abundance of paradise shelducks. Another contention, supported by Alfred Duncan&#x27;s article, &quot;Paradise and the Maori&quot; in the &quot;Lake Wakatip Mail&quot;, in 1860, suggests that the area was named because of its beauty.

<doc id="998227" wikidata="Q1355485" url="?curid=998227" title="United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia">
<text>The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA; ) is one of five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The role of the Commission is to promote economic and social development of Western Asia through regional and subregional cooperation and integration.

The Commission is composed of 21 member states, all from the regions of North Africa and the Middle East.

The Commission works closely with the divisions of the Headquarters in New York and United Nations specialized agencies, as well as with international and regional organizations. The League of Arab States, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are among its regional partners.

== History ==
The Commission was first established by the Economic and Social Council on 9 August 1973 as the United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia (ECWA). The Commission was the successor to the United Nations Economic and Social Office in Beirut (UNESOB), which was absorbed into the framework of ECWA. Its main mandate was to &quot;initiate and participate in measures for facilitating concerted action for the economic reconstruction and development of Western Asia.&quot;

On 26 July 1985, in recognition of the social component of its work, the Commission was renamed to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) by the Economic and Social Council.

== Member States ==

The following are all member States of the Commission:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Syria
* 


== Locations ==
The Commission&#x27;s headquarters have been located in the Central District of Beirut, Lebanon, since 1997. Prior to this, the headquarters moved between multiple cites. The first headquarters of the Commission were located in Beirut from 1974 to 1982. They then moved to Baghdad, Iraq, from 1982 to 1991. Finally, they were located in Amman, Jordan, from 1991 to 1997 before moving back to Beirut.

== Executive Secretaries ==
The following is a list of the Executive Secretaries of the Commission since its foundation:

== Funding ==
The budget of Commission comes mainly from contributions from the United Nations, but also from donations from governments, regional funds, private foundations and international development agencies. In 2017, the total budget of the Commission was US$27.4 million. Additionally, since 2014, the Commission has received $7.1 million in voluntary contributions to help implement national and regional activities.

The Commission has four main budgets: the regular budget, the regular programme of technical cooperation (RPTC), the development account and the extrabudgetary projects account.

=== Regular budget ===
The regular budget line item is voted on by the United Nations General Assembly on a biennial basis and provides the Commission with resources fulfil its mandate as laid out in the Strategic Framework. In 2017, the regular budget was $19.9 million.

=== Regular programme of technical cooperation (RPTC) ===
The regular programme of technical cooperation line item works to support member states in formulating sustainable socioeconomic development policies. In 2017, the regular programme of technical cooperation budget was $2.3 million.

=== Development account ===
The development account line item helps fund capacity building projects at national, subregional, regional and interregional levels. In 2017, the development account budget was $1.9 million.

=== Extrabudgetary projects ===
The extra budgetary projects line item supports economic and social development under the seven subprograms of the Commission: Economic Development and Integration, Gender and Women Issues, Governance and Conflict Issues, Natural Resources, Social Development, Statistics and Technology for Development. In 2017, extra budgetary projects budget was $3.2 million.

== Israel-Palestine report controversy ==
On 15 March 2017, UNESCWA released a report accusing Israel (not a UNESCWA member state) of being an &quot;apartheid regime&quot; due to Israel&#x27;s relations with Palestinians both inside and outside Israel. The report was officially withdrawn and removed from UN websites after criticism from the Secretary-General who said it had been issued by ESCWA without approval.

The document was co-authored by Richard Falk, professor of International Law and Practice Emeritus at Princeton University and a former UN human rights investigator for the Palestinian territories, and Virginia Tilley, professor of Political Science at Southern Illinois University. It criticised Israel&#x27;s law of return for Jews. Falk and Tilley wrote: &quot;Israel defends its rejection of the Palestinians&#x27; return in frankly racist language: alleging that Palestinians constitute a &#x27;demographic threat&#x27; and that their return would alter the demographic character of Israel to the point of eliminating it as a Jewish state&quot;.

Rima Khalaf, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCWA, had said it was the first to accuse Israel of being a racist state which had established an apartheid system. The report itself said it had established on the &quot;basis of scholarly inquiry and overwhelming evidence, that Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid&quot;. Israel has condemned the report. &quot;We expected of course that Israel and its allies would put huge pressure on the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that he would disavow the report, and that they would ask him to withdraw it,&quot; Khalaf said to AFP.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres distanced himself from the report and the document was removed from UN website on Friday, 17 March 2017. The report&#x27;s Executive Summary was also deleted from the United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL).

On 17 March, Khalaf submitted her letter of resignation to Guterres. Following the strong response from Israel, she wrote: &quot;It is only normal for criminals to pressure and attack those who advocate the cause of their victims.&quot; She continued to stand by the report.

== Women in the Judiciary ==
In 2019, ESCWA reported regarding the situation of women in the judiciary system, in which only three countries had not appointed female judges yet, including Oman, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. Other countries which already had female judges were: Iraq (1959), Morocco (1961), Algeria (1962), Sudan (1965 or 1976), Lebanon and Tunisia (1966), Yemen (1971), Syria (1975), Palestine (1982), Libya (1991), Jordan (1996), Egypt (2003), Bahrain (2006), the United Arab Emirates (2008), Qatar (2010), Mauritania (2013), and Kuwait (2020). In June 2021, Egypt announced that female judges would take seats in Public Prosecution and State Council in October that year.

<text>NTV (Cyrillic: НТВ) is a Russian free-to-air television channel that was launched as a subsidiary of Vladimir Gusinsky&#x27;s company . Since 14 April 2001 Gazprom Media controls the network. NTV has no official meaning according to Igor Malashenko, the author of the name and co-founder of the company, but in the 1990s unofficial transcripts of the acronym include &quot;New&quot; (&quot;Novoje&quot;), &quot;Independent&quot; (&quot;Nezavisimoje&quot;), &quot;Non-governmental&quot; (&quot;Negosudarstvennoje&quot;), &quot;Our&quot; (&quot;Nashe&quot;).

== History ==
===Gusinsky era (1993-2001)===
Gusinsky founded NTV broadcasting in October 1993 on channel 4. It moved to channel 5 in January 1994. He attracted talented journalists and news anchors of the time such as Tatiana Mitkova, Leonid Parfyonov, Mikhail Osokin, Yevgeniy Kiselyov, Vladimir A. Kara-Murza, Victor Shenderovich and others. The channel set high professional standards in Russian television, broadcasting live coverage and sharp analysis of current events. Starting before the dissolution of Soviet Union as Fourth Programme, the channel broadcast a daily news programme &quot;Segodnya&quot; and a weekly news-commentary programme &quot;Itogi&quot; which was jointly supported by the United States magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot; (at the time, a subsidiary of The Washington Post Company, now Graham Holdings Company). In the early 1990s, , a multibillion-dollar advertising agency, obtained exclusive advertising rights on NTV.

It commented favorably on President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1996.

By 1999 NTV had achieved an audience of 102 million, covering about 70% of Russia&#x27;s territory, and was available in other former Soviet republics.

During parliamentary elections in 1999 and presidential elections in 2000, NTV was critical of the Second Chechen War, Vladimir Putin and the political party Unity backed by him. In the puppet show &quot;Kukly&quot; (&#x27;Puppets&#x27;) in the beginning of February 2000, the puppet of Putin acted as Little Zaches in a story based on E.T.A. Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Little Zaches Called Cinnabar&quot;, in which blindness causes villagers to mistake an evil gnome for a beautiful youth. This provoked a fierce reaction from Putin&#x27;s supporters. On 8 February the newspaper &quot;Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti&quot; published a letter signed by the Rector of St. Petersburg State University Lyudmila Verbitskaya, the Dean of its Law Department Nikolay Kropachyov and some of Putin&#x27;s other presidential campaign assistants that urged the prosecution of the authors of the show for what they considered a criminal offence.

==== Talk show with people of Ryazan and FSB members ====
On 24 March 2000, two days before the presidential elections, NTV featured the Ryazan apartment bombing of fall 1999 in the talk show &quot;Independent Investigation&quot;. The interviews of the residents of the Ryazan apartment building, along with FSB public relations director Alexander Zdanovich and Ryazan branch head Alexander Sergeyev was filmed a few days earlier. On 26 March, Boris Nemtsov voiced his concern over the possible shut-down of NTV for airing the talk.

Seven months later, NTV general manager Igor Malashenko said at the JFK School of Government that the Information Minister Mikhail Lesin had warned him on several occasions. Malashenko&#x27;s recollection of Lesin&#x27;s warning was that by airing the talk show NTV had &quot;crossed a line&quot; and that the NTV managers were &quot;outlaws&quot; in the eyes of the Kremlin.

According to Alexander Goldfarb, Malashenko told him that Valentin Yumashev had brought a warning from the Kremlin, one day before the airing of the show, promising in no uncertain terms that the NTV managers &quot;should consider themselves finished&quot; if they went ahead with the broadcast.

=== Eviction of management (2000-2001) ===

On 11 May 2000, tax police, backed by officers from the general prosecutor&#x27;s office and the FSB, stormed the Moscow headquarters of NTV and Media-Most and searched the premises for 12 hours. Critics considered this move politically motivated, as NTV voiced opposition to Putin since his presidential electoral campaign. Putin denied any involvement.

Viktor Shenderovich claimed that an unnamed top government official requested NTV to exclude the puppet of Putin from &quot;Kukly&quot;. Accordingly, in the following episode of the show, called &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;, the puppet of Putin was replaced with a cloud covering the top of a mountain and a burning bush.

The program &quot;Itogi&quot; went on investigating corruption in the Russian government and the autumn 1999 blasts in Russia.

On 13 June 2000, Gusinsky was detained as a suspect in the General Prosecutor Office&#x27;s criminal investigation of fraud between his Media-Most holding, Russkoye Video – 11th Channel Ltd. and the federal enterprise Russkoye Video. At the time, Media-Most was involved in a dispute over the loan received from Gazprom. On the third day, however, he was released under the written undertaking not to leave the country.

On 15 July, the puppet of Putin acted in the &quot;Kukly&quot; show as Girolamo Savonarola.

On 19 July, investigators of the office of the Prosecutor General of Russia came to Gusinsky&#x27;s home, distrained and arrested his property.

In a surprisingly informal deal, the charges against Gusinsky were lifted after he signed an agreement with Mikhail Lesin, Minister of Media, on 20 July. Under the &quot;shares for freedom&quot; transaction or Protocol No.6 (&quot;Протокол N.6. Доля свободы&quot;) agreement, Gusinsky would discharge his debts by selling Media-Most to Gazprom-Media, which had held a 30% share of NTV since 1996, for the price imposed by the latter, and was given a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted. After leaving the country, Gusinsky claimed he was pressured to sign the agreement by the prospect of the criminal investigation. Media-Most refused to comply with the agreement.

Tax authorities brought a suit against Media-Most aiming to wind it up.

On 26 January 2001, Gazprom announced that it had acquired a controlling stake of 46% in NTV. The voting rights of a 19% stake held by Media-Most was frozen by a court decision.

Putin met with leading NTV journalists on 29 January, but the meeting changed nothing. The parties reasserted their positions; Putin denied any involvement and said that he could not interfere with the prosecutors and courts.

Around that time American media mogul Ted Turner (owner and founder of the Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary of Time Warner) appeared to be going to buy Gusinsky&#x27;s share, but this has never happened.

On 3 April, Gazprom Media headed by Alfred Kokh by violating the procedure conducted a shareholders&#x27; meeting which removed Kiselyov from the NTV Director General position.

===Gazprom era (2001-present)===

On 14 April 2001, Gazprom took over NTV by force and brought in its own management team. Its director-general Yevgeniy Kiselyov was replaced by Boris Jordan. Many leading journalists, including Yevgeniy Kiselyov, Svetlana Sorokina, Viktor Shenderovich, Vladimir A. Kara-Murza, Dmitry Dibrov, left the company. Leonid Parfyonov and Tatyana Mitkova remained. Kiselyov&#x27;s &quot;Itogi&quot; program was closed down, replaced by Parfyonov&#x27;s &quot;Namedni&quot;.

Citizens concerned by the threat to the freedom of speech in Russia argued that the financial pressure was inspired by the Vladimir Putin&#x27;s government, which was often subject to NTV&#x27;s criticism. Some tens of thousands of Russians rallied to the call of dissident NTV journalists in order to support the old NTV staff in April 2001. Within the next couple of years, two independent TV channels which absorbed the former NTV journalists, TV-6 and TVS, were also shut down.

In January 2003, Boris Jordan was ousted as director general and replaced by Nikolay Senkevich, son of TV-presenter Yuri Senkevich from Channel One. A few days earlier he was also discharged from Media-Most director-general position, where he had replaced Alfred Kokh in October 2001. As insiders claimed, Jordan was sacked because NTV had carried a live translation of the culmination of the Moscow theater siege in October 2002 and had been too critical of the way authorities handled it.

Since then, entertaining talk-shows have become more prominent on NTV, rather than political programmes. However, unlike other leading TV channels in Russia, NTV went on reporting on-the-fly about some opposition activities and government failures, including the conflagrating fire of the Moscow Manege on the day of the Russian presidential elections on 14 March 2004, and the assassination of the pro-Russian President of Chechnya Akhmad Kadyrov on Victory Day 9 May 2004.

On 1 June 2004, Leonid Parfyonov, one of the last leading journalists from the old NTV staff who remained, and who was still critical of the government, was ousted from the channel, and his weekly news commentary programme &quot;Namedni&quot; was taken off the air. Its last announced episode never aired. Shortly before this, Parfyonov had been forbidden to present an interview with Malika Yandarbieva, widow of Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. Zelimkhan Yandarbiev had been assassinated in exile in Qatar earlier that year. Parfyonov had shared this decision with the public on 31 May.

On 5 July 2004, Senkevich was replaced by Vladimir Kulistikov (b. 1952) as director general of NTV. Tamara Gavrilova, formerly a fellow student with Vladimir Putin at Leningrad State University, was appointed deputy director general.

Soon the political programmes &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; hosted by Savik Shuster (Shuster works in Ukraine since 2005), &quot;Personal Contribution&quot; hosted by Aleksandr Gerasimov, and &quot;Red Arrow&quot; were closed down.
From 2006 to 2009, NTV ran weekly news commentary programme &quot;Sunday Night&quot; in a talk-show format and political talk-show &quot;On The Stand&quot;, both hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, as well as weekly news commentary programme &quot;Real Politics&quot; hosted on Saturdays from 2005 to 2008 by political analyst and key Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky.

NTV began to be broadcast in widescreen in April 2013, hosted its own coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and joined the long list of Russian TV networks broadcasting in HD on 9 February 2015.

==== Controversy over Ukraine ====
In August 2014, NTV aired a documentary titled &quot;13 Friends of the Junta&quot;, which described critics of Russia&#x27;s policies in Ukraine as &quot;traitors&quot; and supporters of &quot;fascists&quot;. &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; reported that footage of Andrey Makarevich&#x27;s concert in Sviatohirsk &quot;was merged with images of the fighting that he supposedly endorsed. The program never mentions that the concert was for the benefit of Ukraine&#x27;s internally displaced children.&quot; In 2015, NTV fired a journalist who criticized Vladimir Putin and his policy towards Ukraine.

Another program &quot;Anatomy of a protest&quot; was also presenting most of the anti-government protesters in former USSR countries as &quot;Western puppets&quot; or CIA inspired agents. The producers of the program, Pyotr Drogovoz and Liliya Parfyonova, were also accused of frequently receiving wiretap information from FSB which allowed them to pay surprise visits with camera on various opposition meetings.

Shortly after the Crocus City Hall attack, for which the Islamic State – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility, NTV broadcast a doctored video using audio deepfaking, purporting to show Oleksiy Danilov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, confirming Ukrainian involvement in the attack, supposedly saying, &quot;It&#x27;s fun in Moscow today, I think it&#x27;s very fun. I would like to believe that we will arrange such fun for them more often.&quot; The deepfake was created by patching together previous news streams of the Ukrainian 1+1 channel.

====Sanctions over Ukraine====
In 2022, the Denis Diderot Committee, a European group of academic researchers and professionals called for sanctions against NTV Plus for having cancelled various international news channels from its line-up.

On 8 May 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury placed sanctions on NTV Broadcasting Company pursuant to for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Russia.

== Visual identity ==
The logo design has remained relatively the same since April 1994, with the НТВ typograph and a ball below the &quot;T&quot;.

=== Logo history ===
Its first logo in 1993 featured a simple НТВ typograph, but this was replaced with another logo on 11 April 1994, featuring the НТВ typograph with a ball. This would be the template for the succeeding 5 logos. During August 1994, the logo featured a white outline, though still retaining the НТВ typograph, and the ball has a gradient. However, in September 1994, this was replaced with a black-and-white striped outlined logo, with the ball touching the letters.

Over time, the ball would become larger, but since 2001, the ball is smaller. The 1997 logo featured an entirely black and thicker outline, and the ball has a glass feel. In 2001, a similar logo was launched, but with a blue outline and a smaller ball. On 4 June 2007, a new logo was launched, featuring the 2001 logo, but entirely white (except the ball) inside a green box. Logos similar to the current logo, with a larger typograph, are used in idents and promos. In 2010, a variant of the 2007 logo was introduced, but without the green box. It is commonly used as the on-screen bug, changing between it and the green box logo.

The colorful &quot;NTV&quot; logo as well as the iconic green sphere were designed by Simon Levin, the Russian designer, and became a symbol for the new graphic language of television design in Russia.

=== On-screen bug ===
When it first launched on 10 October 1993, the logo was in the lower right corner. However, on 1 December that same year, the logo moved to the lower left.

<text>&quot;Tessie&quot; is both the longtime anthem of Major League Baseball (MLB)&#x27;s Boston Red Sox and a 2004 song by the punk rock group Dropkick Murphys. The original &quot;Tessie&quot; was from the 1902 Broadway musical &quot;The Silver Slipper&quot;. The newer song, written in 2004, recounts how the singing of the original &quot;Tessie&quot; by the Royal Rooters fan club helped the Boston Americans win the first World Series in . The name &quot;Tessie&quot; itself is a diminutive form used with several names, including Esther, Tess, and Theresa/Teresa.

==Broadway and Royal Rooters version==
The original version of &quot;Tessie (You Are the Only, Only, Only)&quot; was written by Will R. Anderson and was featured in the Broadway musical &quot;The Silver Slipper&quot;, which ran for 160 performances between October 27, 1902 and March 14, 1903. The song was about a woman singing to her beloved parakeet &quot;Tessie&quot;.

While a popular tune, the song gained greater fame when it was adopted as a rallying cry by the Royal Rooters, a collection of loyal fans led by Michael T. McGreevy, informally known as &quot;Nuf Ced&quot; McGreevy, owner of the 3rd Base saloon. McGreevy earned his nickname &quot;Nuf Ced&quot; due to the way he kept peace in his bar: when he grew frustrated with arguments over the Boston Americans (who would later be renamed the Red Sox) and the Boston Braves (who would later move to Milwaukee and, eventually, Atlanta), he would pound his hand on the bar and declare &quot;&#x27;Nuff [enough] said!&quot;. Boston mayor John &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, grandfather of President John F. Kennedy, was a member of the Royal Rooters.

After the first four games of the 1903 World Series, Boston was down 1-3 to the Pittsburgh Pirates. (It was a best-of-nine series; five wins were needed to win the series.) The Royal Rooters began rallying their team with every song they could think of; ultimately &quot;Tessie&quot; helped win the day. There are stories that the Royal Rooters actually traveled to Pittsburgh and hired a band to play &quot;Tessie&quot; to annoy the Pirates on their home field. Pittsburgh outfielder Tommy Leach credited at least part of Boston&#x27;s win to &quot;that damn &#x27;Tessie&#x27; song.&quot; He continued: &quot;It was a real hum-dinger of a song, but it sort of got on your nerves after a while.&quot;

Boston won Game 5 and went on to win Games 6, 7, and 8 to win the Series. The Boston fans remembered &quot;Tessie&quot; fondly through the years; Burt Mustin, who decades later became a prolific &quot;old man&quot; character actor in movies and television, was still regaling audiences with &quot;Tessie&quot; stories while in his nineties.

The chorus to the original &quot;Tessie&quot; goes:
:&quot;Tessie, you make me feel so badly.&quot;
:&quot;Why don&#x27;t you turn around?&quot;
:&quot;Tessie, you know I love you madly.&quot;
:&quot;Babe, my heart weighs about a pound.&quot;
:&quot;Don&#x27;t blame me if I ever doubt you,&quot;
:&quot;You know I wouldn&#x27;t live without you.&quot;
:&quot;Tessie, you are the only, only, only.&quot;

The fans began inventing their own lyrics to taunt the Pittsburgh players, such as:
:&quot;Honus, why do you hit so badly?&quot;
:&quot;Take a back seat and sit down&quot;
:&quot;Honus, at bat you look so sadly.&quot;
:&quot;Hey, why don&#x27;t you get out of town?&quot;
etc.

The Rooters stopped singing in 1918. The Red Sox won the World Series in 1918 but then endured an 86-year drought before winning again in 2004, the same year a re-release of &quot;Tessie&quot; was issued by the Dropkick Murphys.

In the 2000s a group of Red Sox fans recreated the track with those lyrics and an additional two stanzas in addition to finishing the Wagner stanza.

:&quot;Honus, why do you hit so badly?&quot;
:&quot;Take a back seat and sit down&quot;
:&quot;Honus, at bat you look so sadly.&quot;
:&quot;Hey, why don&#x27;t you get out of town?&quot;
:&quot;Go find another team to hit for&quot;
:&quot;Pittsburgh is just the pits and therefore&quot;
:&quot;Honus, you are a phony phony phony&quot;

They also wrote a stanza on Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez:

:&quot;A-Rod you&#x27;re overpaid overrated&quot;
:&quot;Why do we hate you so&quot;
:&quot;Your contract should be terminated&quot;
:&quot;Because you don&#x27;t deserve to be making all that dough (300 Million)&quot;
:&quot;You almost got away with cheatin&quot;&#x27;
:&quot;But the Red Sox weren&#x27;t the team to be beatin&quot;&#x27;
:&quot;A-Rod you are a hanky panky Yankee.&quot;

Yankee captain Derek Jeter also got a stanza.

==Dropkick Murphys version==

In 2004, the Boston-area celtic punk group Dropkick Murphys recorded a cover of &quot;Tessie&quot;, released on an EP of the same name. In the music video, Tessie the &quot;broom girl,&quot; was played by Colleen Reilly. The Dropkicks said it was their intent to &quot;bring back the spirit of the Rooters and to put the Red Sox back on top.&quot; The goal of the Dropkicks was realized when later that year the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. The song is also featured as the bonus track on their June 2005 release &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Code&quot; with a lead-in from the WEEI broadcast of the final play in the 2004 World Series: &quot;Swing and a ground ball, stabbed by Foulke. He has it. He underhands to first. And the Boston Red Sox are the World Champions. For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox have won baseball&#x27;s world championship. Can you believe it?&quot; -Joe Castiglione

The second &quot;Tessie&quot; — which featured backing vocals from Red Sox players Johnny Damon, Bronson Arroyo, and Lenny DiNardo, Red Sox Vice President of Public Affairs Dr. Charles Steinberg; and &quot;Boston Herald&quot; sportswriter Jeff Horrigan (who co-wrote the new lyrics with the Dropkick Murphys) — has become a theme song for the Red Sox and tells the story of the Royal Rooters singing the original &quot;Tessie&quot;.

The song is featured in the soundtrack to the 2005 movie, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, and is the song used in the closing credits to the VHS and DVD review of the 2004 World Series, a video that was produced by Major League Baseball Productions. The video game MVP Baseball 2005 features the song.

In addition to &quot;Tessie&quot;, the EP includes &quot;Fields of Athenry&quot;, &quot;Nut Rocker&quot; (an instrumental rock version of the Boston Bruins theme song), &quot;The Burden&quot; as performed live on WBCN, &quot;Tessie (Old Timey Baseball Version)&quot; in which the song is accompanied primarily by a ballpark organ, as well as a music video for &quot;Tessie.&quot; Proceeds from the sale of the EP went to benefit the Red Sox Foundation. (&quot;Nut Rocker&quot; inspired &quot;Nutty&quot; by The Ventures, which was long associated with the Boston Bruins hockey team, as it was the theme song for Bruins telecasts on WSBK-TV.)

&quot;Tessie&quot; is the second of three songs played after every Red Sox win at Fenway Park, the first being &quot;Dirty Water&quot; by The Standells. The third is &quot;Joy to the World&quot; by Three Dog Night.

Trot Nixon used &quot;Tessie&quot; as his at-bat intro music when he played for the Red Sox.

&quot;Tessie&quot; was played at the end of regulation, prior to the start of overtime during the National Hockey League&#x27;s 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park.

A synthesized version of &quot;Tessie&quot; is used by Red Sox ticketing, as the signal a customer has been selected from the team&#x27;s virtual waiting room to purchase tickets during busy periods.

The Dropkick Murphys tell this version of the story in the liner notes of their album &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Code&quot;:

==Inspiration for Red Sox mascots==

In the winter of 2015–16, it was stated that the as-yet &quot;unknown&quot; young sister of the popular Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster, aptly named Tessie, was going to join her famous &quot;older brother&quot; at Red Sox games starting in the 2016 MLB season.

<doc id="998239" wikidata="Q6746358" url="?curid=998239" title="Man in the Air">
<text>Man in the Air is the sixth album by jazz vocalist Kurt Elling, recorded and released in 2003 by Blue Note Records.

==Musicians and music==
As for all the previous albums Elling is accompanied by a piano trio led by his musical partner Laurence Hobgood, bassist Rob Amster and with Frank Parker Jr. a new drummer again. Paul Wertico, formerly behind the drum set, is only heard on the first track. The &quot;sonic idea&quot; for the album was to add vibraphonist Stefon Harris who appears now on several tracks and is named on the album cover. Furthermore soprano saxophonists Jim Gailloreto and Brad Wheeler perform as guest musicians. On some tracks Elling uses overdubs of his voice.

Seven of the twelve tracks are adaptations of originally instrumental compositions to which Elling wrote lyrics to, most prominently John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Resolution&quot; from his epic cycle &quot;A Love Supreme.&quot; Besides &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;A Secret I&quot;, i.e. Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Alone and I&quot; from his debut &quot;Takin&#x27; Off,&quot; the entry track &quot;Minuano&quot; written by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays (from Metheny&#x27;s &quot;Still Life (Talking)&quot;) formed the basic material for &quot;Man in the Air,&quot; initially should have been the opener for &quot;This Time It&#x27;s Love,&quot; but the label convinced the musicians that it did not fit the album&#x27;s character, it was &quot;too futurist for this side&quot; as Elling put it in hindsight.

The other compositions Elling and Hobgood adapted were by Joe Zawinul (&quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, i.e. &quot;A Remark You Made&quot; from &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;), Courtney Pine (&quot;Higher Vibe&quot; from &quot;Underground&quot;) and Bobby Watson (&quot;Hidden Jewel&quot; from &quot;Jewel&quot;). The last track of the album, &quot;All Is Quiet&quot;, a duo by Elling and Hobgood, is a composition by Bob Mintzer, who already recorded the song together with Elling in 1998 on The Yellowjackets album &quot;Club Nocturne&quot; and in 2002 with the Bob Mintzer Big Band (&quot;Live at MCG with Special Guest Kurt Elling).&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;This is perhaps &quot;the&quot; jazz vocal album of the last decade. Almost ten years on from his debut, Elling delivers a bold and accomplished performance, marked by highly original choice of material and some devastating playing from his regular band&quot;, write Richard Cook and Brian Morton in their &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz.&quot; &quot;Elling&#x27;s scat and his delivery of a ballad are now so confident that he is able to take on material like John Coltrane&#x27;s &#x27;Resolution&#x27; and bring to it a genuine philosophical understanding as well as a musically coherent performance.&quot; In 2006 they concluded: &quot;This is a remarkable record, as accessible as it is challenging.&quot; In their definitive &quot;Penguin Jazz Guide&quot; from 2010 they did not change any of the review but went even further closing: &quot;It is so good, it&#x27;s almost sinful.&quot;

Thom Jurek of AllMusic is equally eloquent in his praise and stresses too Elling&#x27;s mature interpretation of &quot;Resolution&quot; while also recognizing &quot;a new way&quot; for listeners to access the composer John Coltrane. And like Cook and Morton he sees the importance of Laurence Hobgood: &quot;Hobgood is a criminally under-recognized pianist. His sense of harmonic architecture and melodic invention are among the most innovative of the current grown-up generation of jazz players, and his allowance for space and nuance acts as a perfect foil for Elling&#x27;s rigorous restructuring of intervals and cadences.&quot;

Howard Reich of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the album as one of the year&#x27;s very best, writing that &quot;the luster of Elling’s vocals, the nimbleness of his scat technique, the plaintive quality of his lyrics and the ingenuity of his vocalese reaffirm Elling’s position as the pre-eminent male vocalist of the under-40 generation.&quot;

&quot;Man in the Air&quot; received a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, the sixth successive nomination in that category since Elling&#x27;s debut and seventh nomination in total.

<text>Fijnaart is a town in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is located in the municipality of Moerdijk, about 8 km west of the town of Zevenbergen.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1380 as &quot;die fiinre&quot;. The etymology is unclear. The area around Fijnaart was &quot;diked&quot; around 1380, but lost in the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1421. A new dike was built in the 16th century. Fijnaart developed in the mid-16th century. The Voorstraat was the wide main street and was placed at right angles from the dike. The church was built at the end of the Voorstraat.

The Dutch Reformed church is a T-shaped building. The tower was added in 1875. The Catholic Jacobuskerk dates from 1925. It was destroyed by war in October 1944 and rebuilt in 1953.

Fort Sabina Henrica was built in 1811 by the French after the English tried to invade Walcheren in 1809. It was part of two opposing forts, and named Duquesne after Abraham Duquesne. In 1813, after the French defeat, it was renamed Fort Prins Frederik. In 1913, it received its current name. The fort was enlarged and modified between 1880 and 1883. In 1924, it was decommissioned because it had become obsolete. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was used as an ammunition depot. It was bought by the municipality in 1977.

Fijnaart was home to 570 people in 1840. The village used to part of the municipality of Fijnaart en Heijningen. In 1996, it was merged into Moerdijk.

== Notable people ==
* O&#x27;G3NE, the sisters Lisa, Amy and Shelley Vol, who won &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot; and represented Netherlands at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 with &quot;Lights And Shadows&quot;.
* Frans Bauer, singer/songwriter of folk music

<doc id="998245" wikidata="Q1303872" url="?curid=998245" title="Lake Dunstan">
<text>Lake Dunstan is a man-made lake and reservoir in the Otago Region of the South Island of New Zealand.

The lake was formed on the Clutha River as a result of the construction of the Clyde Dam, filling in four controlled stages beginning in April 1992 and completed the next year. Parts of the town of Cromwell were relocated to a new area above the new lake. Between the town of Cromwell and the Clyde Dam the lake passes through what is called the Cromwell Gorge.

Lake Dunstan provides irrigation for nearby stone fruit orchards and vineyards, and is a major recreational asset, with facilities for boating, waterskiing, fishing, parapenting, and rowing.

The dam and lake became well known in New Zealand due to media coverage of the geological problems during its construction. While the dam was being built at least one landslide occurred at Cairnmuir, a series of bluffs overlooking the gorge where the dam was built. All parties involved denied responsibility for not finding the problem.

Because of the expense of stabilising the gorge walls and the changing economic climate, this was also the last of the Third National Government&#x27;s Think Big projects.

==Protests==

There was vocal protest against the project from the local community, with calls for the planning and project to cease. Environmentalists, scientists, lawyers, recreational river users, families that had lived here for generations, and others that had recently moved to the area protested, none seemingly more poignantly than the artists.

There was a perception that the power from the dam was intended for an aluminium smelter near Dunedin. Prominent figures including Ralph Hotere, Andrew Drummond, Chris Cree Brown and Chris Booth did significant and powerful work that related to the smelter issue, gaining publicity and acclaim with exhibitions and appropriate comment in various art magazines. Other artists worked on the dam issue: Robin Morrison created a sensitive series of portraits on the residents affected by the flooding; Marilynn Webb a compelling series of prints called &quot;Good Bye- Clutha Blue&quot; in 1983; Bruce Foster a series of Ciba-chrome prints investigating the pre-construction lines painted on the land, and Lloyd Godman a significant series of large photo-mural prints, toned with gold from the Clutha River, entitled “The Last River&#x27;s Song”. During the filling of the dam to form Lake Dunstan in 1992–93, Godman also completed a series of performance works entitled &quot;Lake Fill&quot;, which involved using an underwater camera to take a series of photographs of a selected vista up the river showing its gradual obliteration due to the rising lake level.

<doc id="998255" wikidata="Q2445824" url="?curid=998255" title="Dharmaguptaka">
<text>The Dharmaguptaka (Sanskrit: धर्मगुप्तक; ; ) are one of the eighteen or twenty early Buddhist schools, depending on the source. They are said to have originated from another sect, the Mahīśāsakas. The Dharmaguptakas had a prominent role in early Central Asian and Chinese Buddhism, and their Prātimokṣa (monastic rules for bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs) are still in effect in East Asian countries to this day, including China, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan as well as the Philippines. They are one of three surviving Vinaya lineages, along with that of the Theravāda and the Mūlasarvāstivāda.

==Etymology==
&quot;Guptaka&quot; means &quot;preserver&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot; &quot;law, justice, morality&quot;, and, most likely, the set of laws of Northern Buddhism.

==Doctrinal development==

===Overview===
The Dharmaguptakas regarded the path of a śrāvaka (&quot;śrāvakayāna&quot;) and the path of a bodhisattva (&quot;bodhisattvayāna&quot;) to be separate. A translation and commentary on the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; reads:

According to the &quot;Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra&quot;, the Dharmaguptakas held that the Four Noble Truths are to be observed simultaneously.

Vasubandhu states that the Dharmaguptakas held, in agreement with Theravada and against Sarvāstivāda, that realization of the four noble truths happens all at once (&quot;ekābhisamaya&quot;).

The Dharmaguptaka are known to have rejected the authority of the Sarvāstivāda prātimokṣa rules on the grounds that the original teachings of the Buddha had been lost.

===Twelve aṅgas===
The Dharmaguptaka used a twelvefold division of the Buddhist teachings, which has been found in their &quot;Dīrgha Āgama&quot;, their &quot;Vinaya&quot;, and in some Mahāyāna sūtras. These twelve divisions are: &quot;sūtra&quot;, &quot;geya&quot;, &quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;, &quot;gāthā&quot;, &quot;udāna&quot;, &quot;nidāna&quot;, &quot;jātaka&quot;, &quot;itivṛttaka&quot;, &quot;vaipulya&quot;, &quot;adbhūtadharma&quot;, &quot;avadāna&quot;, and &quot;upadeśa&quot;.

==Appearance and language==

===Robes===
Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which described the color of monastic robes (Skt. &quot;kāṣāya&quot;) utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called &quot;Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi&quot; (). Another text translated at a later date, the &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;, contains a very similar passage with nearly the same information. However, the colors for Dharmaguptaka and Sarvāstivāda are reversed. In the earlier source, the Sarvāstivāda are described as wearing deep red robes, while the Dharmaguptaka are described as wearing black robes. The corresponding passage found in the later &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;, in contrast, portrays the Sarvāstivāda as wearing black robes and the Dharmaguptaka as wearing deep red robes.

During the Tang dynasty, Chinese Buddhist monastics typically wore grayish-black robes and were even colloquially referred to as &quot;Zīyī&quot; (), &quot;those of the black robes.&quot; However, the Song dynasty monk Zanning (919–1001 CE) writes that during the earlier Han-Wei period, the Chinese monks typically wore red robes.

According to the Dharmaguptaka vinaya, the robes of monastics should be sewn out of no more than 18 pieces of cloth, and the cloth should be fairly heavy and coarse.

===Language===
A consensus has grown in scholarship which sees the first wave of Buddhist missionary work as associated with the Gāndhārī language and the Kharoṣṭhī script and tentatively with the Dharmaguptaka sect. However, there is evidence that other sects and traditions of Buddhism also used Gāndhārī, and further evidence that the Dharmaguptaka sect also used Sanskrit at times:
Starting in the first century of the Common Era, there was a large trend toward a type of Gāndhārī which was heavily Sanskritized.

==History==

===In Northwest India===

The Gandharan Buddhist texts, the earliest Buddhist texts ever discovered, are apparently dedicated to the teachers of the Dharmaguptaka school. They tend to confirm a flourishing of the Dharmaguptaka school in northwestern India around the 1st century CE, with Gāndhārī as the canonical language, and this would explain the subsequent influence of the Dharmaguptakas in Central Asia and then northeastern Asia. According to Buddhist scholar A. K. Warder, the Dharmaguptaka originated in Aparānta.

According to one scholar, the evidence afforded by the Gandharan Buddhist texts &quot;suggest[s] that the Dharmaguptaka sect achieved early success under their Indo-Scythian supporters in Gandhāra, but that the sect subsequently declined with the rise of the Kuṣāṇa Empire (ca. mid-first to third century A.D.), which gave its patronage to the Sarvāstivāda sect.&quot;

===In Central Asia===
Available evidence indicates that the first Buddhist missions to Khotan were carried out by the Dharmaguptaka sect:

A number of scholars have identified three distinct major phases of missionary activities seen in the history of Buddhism in Central Asia, which are associated with the following sects, chronologically:
# Dharmagupta
# Sarvāstivāda
# Mūlasarvāstivāda

In the 7th century CE, Xuanzang and Yijing both recorded that the Dharmaguptakas were located in Oḍḍiyāna and Central Asia, but not in the Indian subcontinent. Yijing grouped the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and Kāśyapīya together as sub-sects of the Sarvāstivāda, and stated that these three were not prevalent in the &quot;five parts of India,&quot; but were located in the some parts of Oḍḍiyāna, Khotan, and Kucha.

===In East Asia===
The Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as Iran, Central Asia, and China, and they had great success in doing so. Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka vinaya and ordination lineage for bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs. According to A. K. Warder, in some ways the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present in those East Asian countries. Warder further writes:

During the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian Buddhist sects recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the Dharmaguptakas, Mahīśāsakas, Kāśyapīyas, Sarvāstivādins, and the Mahāsāṃghikas.

Between 250 and 255 CE, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was established in China when Indian monks were invited to help with ordination in China. No full Vinaya had been translated at this time, and only two texts were available: the Dharmaguptaka Karmavācanā for ordination, and the Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa for regulating the life of monks. After the translation of full Vinayas, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was followed by most monks, but temples often regulated monastic life with other Vinaya texts, such as those of the Mahāsāṃghika, the Mahīśāsaka, or the Sarvāstivāda.

In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang&#x27;an), and that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangtze area and further south. In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao An (654–717). In the early 8th century, Dao An gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and an imperial edict was issued that the sangha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka vinaya for ordination.

==Texts==

===Gandhāran Buddhist texts===
The Gandhāran Buddhist texts (the oldest extant Buddhist manuscripts) are attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect by Richard Salomon, the leading scholar in the field, and the British Library scrolls &quot;represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in Nagarāhāra Afghanistan.&quot;

Among the Dharmaguptaka Gandhāran Buddhist texts in the Schøyen Collection, is a fragment in the Kharoṣṭhī script referencing the Six Pāramitās, a central practice for bodhisattvas in Mahāyāna doctrine.

===Vinaya translation===
In the early 5th century CE, Dharmaguptaka Vinaya was translated into Chinese by the Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas (佛陀耶舍) of Kashmir. For this translation, Buddhayaśas recited the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya entirely from memory, rather than reading it from a written manuscript. After its translation, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya became the predominant vinaya in Chinese Buddhist monasticism. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, or monastic rules, are still followed today in China, Vietnam and Korea, and its lineage for the ordination of monks and nuns has survived uninterrupted to this day. The name of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in the East Asian tradition is the &quot;Vinaya in Four Parts&quot; (), and the equivalent Sanskrit title would be &quot;Caturvargika Vinaya&quot;. Ordination under the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya only relates to monastic vows and lineage (&quot;Vinaya&quot;), and does not conflict with the actual Buddhist teachings that one follows (&quot;Dharma&quot;).

===Āgama collections===
The &quot;Dīrgha Āgama&quot; (&quot;Long Discourses,&quot; 長阿含經 &quot;Cháng Āhán Jīng&quot;) (T. 1) corresponds to the &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot; of the Theravada school. A complete version of the &quot;Dīrgha Āgama&quot; of the Dharmaguptaka sect was translated by Buddhayaśas and Zhu Fonian (竺佛念) in the Later Qin dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sūtras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot;.

The &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; (&quot;Incremental Discourses,&quot; 增壹阿含經 &quot;Zēngyī Āhán Jīng&quot;) (T. 125) corresponds to the &quot;Anguttara Nikāya&quot; of the Theravāda school. It was translated into Chinese by Dharmanandi in 384 CE, and edited by Gautama Saṃghadeva in 398 CE. Some have proposed that the original text for this translation came from the Sarvāstivādins or the Mahāsāṃghikas. However, according to A.K. Warder, the &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; references 250 prātimokṣa rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the Mahāsāṃghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; is that of the Dharmaguptakas.

===Abhidharma===
The &quot;Śāriputra Abhidharma Śāstra&quot; (舍利弗阿毘曇論 &quot;Shèlìfú Āpítán Lùn&quot;) (T. 1548) is a complete abhidharma text that is thought to come from the Dharmaguptaka sect. The only complete edition of this text is in Chinese. Sanskrit fragments have been found in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and are now part of the Schøyen Collection (MS 2375/08). These manuscripts are thought to have been part of a monastery library of the Mahāsāṃghika Lokottaravāda sect.

===Additional piṭakas===
The Dharmaguptaka &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; is said to have contained two extra sections that were not included by some other schools. These included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a Mantra Piṭaka ( &quot;Zhòu Zàng&quot;), also sometimes called a Dhāraṇī Piṭaka. According to the fifth-century Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas, the translator of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the &quot;Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka&quot; ( &quot;Dàchéng Sānzàng&quot;).

===&quot;Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra&quot;===

The Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive of all classical biographies of the Buddha, and is entitled &quot;Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra&quot;. Various Chinese translations of this text date from between the 3rd and 6th century CE.

==Relationship to Mahāyāna==
===Kushan era===
It is unknown when some members of the Dharmaguptaka school began to accept the Mahāyāna sūtras, but the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot; records that Kaniṣka (127–151 CE) of the Kuṣāṇa Empire presided over the establishment of Prajñāpāramitā doctrines in the northwest of India. Tāranātha wrote that in this region, 500 bodhisattvas attended the council at Jālandhra monastery during the time of Kaniṣka, suggesting some institutional strength for Mahāyāna in the northwest during this period. Edward Conze goes further to say that Prajñāpāramitā had great success in the northwest during the Kuṣāṇa period, and may have been the &quot;fortress and hearth&quot; of early Mahāyāna, but not its origin, which he associates with the Mahāsāṃghika branch.

===&quot;Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra&quot;===
Jan Nattier writes that available textual evidence suggests that the Mahāyāna &quot;Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra&quot; circulated in Dharmaguptaka communities during its early history, but a later translation shows evidence that the text later circulated amongst the Sarvāstivādins as well. The &quot;Ugraparipṛcchā&quot; also mentions a fourfold division of the Buddhist canon which includes a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, and the Dharmaguptaka are known to have had such a collection in their canon. Nattier further describes the type of community depicted in the &quot;Ugraparipṛcchā:&quot;

===&quot;Ratnarāśivyākaraṇa Sūtra&quot;===
The Mahāyāna &quot;Ratnarāśivyākaraṇa Sūtra&quot;, which is part of the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra&quot;, is believed by some scholars to have a Dharmaguptaka origin or background, due to its specific regulations regarding giving to the Buddha and giving to the Saṃgha.

===Prajñāpāramitā sūtras===
According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (25,000 lines) and the &quot;Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (100,000 lines) have a connection with the Dharmaguptaka sect, while the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (8000 lines) does not. Instead, Guang Xing assesses the view of the Buddha given in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (8000 lines) as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.

===Buddhayaśas===
The translator Buddhayaśas was a Dharmaguptaka monk who was known to be a Mahāyānist, and he is recorded as having learned both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna treatises. He translated the &quot;Dharmaguptaka Vinaya&quot;, the &quot;Dīrgha Āgama&quot;, and Mahāyāna texts including the &quot;Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra&quot; (虛空藏菩薩經 &quot;Xūkōngzàng Púsà Jīng&quot;). The preface written by Buddhayaśas for his translation of the &quot;Dharmaguptaka Vinaya&quot; states that the Dharmaguptakas had assimilated the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka.

===Buddhist canon===
The Dharmaguptakas were said to have had two extra sections in their canon:

# Bodhisattva Piṭaka
# Mantra Piṭaka or Dhāraṇī Piṭaka

In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot;, Asaṅga refers to the collection which contains the Āgamas as the &quot;Śrāvakapiṭaka&quot;, and associates it with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka&quot;, which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.

===Paramārtha===
Paramārtha, a 6th-century CE Indian monk from Ujjain, unequivocally associates the Dharmaguptaka school with the Mahāyāna, and portrays the Dharmaguptakas as being perhaps the closest to a straightforward Mahāyāna sect.

<doc id="998257" wikidata="Q7210362" url="?curid=998257" title="Political party committee">
<text>In the United States, a political party committee is an organization, officially affiliated with a political party and registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which raises and spends money for political campaigning. Political party committees are distinct from political action committees, which are formally independent of political parties and subject to different rules.

Though their own internal rules differ, the two major political parties (Democrats and Republicans) have essentially parallel sets of committees; third parties have more varied organizational structures.

==National committees==
The Democratic National Committee (DNC), Reform Party National Committee, Green National Committee, Libertarian National Committee, and Republican National Committee (RNC) are the official central organizations for their respective parties. They have the greatest role in presidential election years when they are responsible for planning the nominating convention. 

The DNC and RNC were founded in 1848 and 1854, respectively. For much of their histories, the committees consisted of federated state organizations that came together every four years to organize a convention and support a national ticket, but did very little business outside of presidential years. The two committees did not have permanent staff or headquarters in Washington, DC until the early 1900s; Republicans opened their first headquarters in 1918, and Democrats followed in 1929. Beginning in the late 1970s, national party committees, including congressional committees, massively expanded their financial resources, hired larger staffs, and became more active in campaigns. 

Party committees spend heavily in support of their party&#x27;s nominees. Spending by national party committees includes contributions directly to candidate campaigns, expenditures coordinated with nominated candidate campaigns, independent expenditures, and transfers to state or local party committees. National party expenditures may directly support a federal candidate, but may also fund general party building activities, like a voter registration drive that would help all candidates on a party&#x27;s ticket in that area.
===Hill committee===
The two major parties also have two national Hill committees, controlled by their caucus leadership in each house of Congress, which work specifically to elect members of their own party to the United States Congress. &quot;Hill&quot; refers to Capitol Hill, where the seat of Congress, the Capitol, is located. The four major committees are part of the Democratic and Republican parties and each work to help members of their party get elected to their respective chamber, the House of Representatives or the Senate.

The four major committees are the:
* Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC; commonly pronounced &quot;D-triple-C&quot;)
* National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC)
* Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)
* National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC)

Two third parties have Hill committees as well: The Libertarian National Congressional Committee (LNCC) for the Libertarian Party and the Green Senatorial Campaign Committee (GSCC) for the Green Party of the United States.

==== Purpose ====
The goal of these committees is to maximize the number of seats under their party&#x27;s control in a given chamber and to support incumbent members of their caucuses. To advance those goals, the committees spend the bulk of their resources on the closest, most competitive campaigns that are most likely to flip in party control. Researcher Paul Herrnson called these competitive districts &quot;opportunity races.&quot; In addition to opportunity, committees factor campaign and candidate quality, incumbency, and regional goals when weighing spending decisions.

Each committee works to recruit, assist, and support candidates of their own party, for their own chamber, in targeted races around the country. The committees contribute directly to candidates&#x27; campaigns, while also providing campaign-related services that require specialized skills or expertise, like research or targeting. Committees additionally make independent expenditures in support of candidates.

Party committees act as hubs of information, sharing information, strategies, and tactics between connected organizations and allies. For example, party committees may share information about candidates in targeted elections in order to encourage members of the existing caucuses and allied organizations to endorse or donate to their campaign.

Hill committee chairs of the major parties are historically incumbents of each body. As of 2023, the chairs of the DCCC and DSCC are appointed by the party leader, while the chairs of the NRCC and NRSC are voted on by their conference. Typically, they are proven fundraisers with national political ambitions. The committees are run on a day-to-day basis by a professional staff with campaign experience.

=== Fundraising ===
Party committees raise funds at the national level from donors whose focus is on Congress as a whole, rather than individual campaigns. Raising large contributions from national donors for their respective party committees is a major responsibility of party leadership. 

The majority of funds for party committees is raised from individual donors. The individual contribution limit to a single national party committee is indexed to inflation and increases in odd-numbered years. As of 2023, the individual contribution limit was $41,300 per calendar year. 

Party committees additionally raise money from small donors, usually defined as individuals contributing of less than $200, the point at which the FEC requires a donors full name to be listed on fundraising reports. PACs, representing interest groups, industries, or businesses, also provide a major source of funds for party committees.

Additionally, the Hill committees rely on &quot;dues&quot; paid by existing members of each party&#x27;s caucuses. Candidates can make unlimited transfers from personal campaign committees to party organizations, as well as a maximum contribution from any leadership PAC account. In the 2006 election cycle, contributions from members of Congress campaign committees and leadership PACs accounted for 8% of receipts collected by Republican party committees and 11% of receipts by Democratic party committees.

==State and local committees==
Prior to the 1950s, many state and local party committees were a source of patronage jobs, but civil service reforms led to the decline of those systems. During the 1970s and 1980s, state party committees shifted toward professionalized operations mirroring national party committees, concentrating on fundraising and campaign services. 

State party organizations typically have both federal and non-federal accounts, and money can be transferred between the two under certain circumstances. (A third and more complicated category of money, Levin funds, has been created by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.) As of 2023, the federal limit for individual contributions to a state and related local party committees is $10,000 per year. Though the amount an individual can give to both the national and state party organizations are limited, there are no limits to how much state parties can transfer to their partner national parties. Campaign finance watchdogs have criticized transfers between state and national party committees for creating loopholes to avoid contribution limits.

In many states, legislative campaign committees or assembly campaign committees are operated by political parties in order to raise funds and campaign for the election of party members to the state legislatures. Similar to federal party committees, these organizations recruit candidates and pool resources, staff, and expertise in order to run more effective campaigns. These are federated under such national organizations as the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (formed in 1994) and Republican State Leadership Committee (formed in 2002).

<doc id="998258" wikidata="Q2398496" url="?curid=998258" title="Amish Paradise">
<text>&quot;Amish Paradise&quot; is a 1996 single by satirist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. It is a parody of the hip hop song &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; by Coolio featuring L.V. (which itself is a reworking of the Stevie Wonder song &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;). Featured on the album &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;, it turns the original &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, in which the narrator laments his dangerous way of life, on its head by presenting an Amish man praising his relatively plain and uncomplicated existence.

==Track listing==
# &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; – 3:20
# &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot; – 3:46
# &quot;The Night Santa Went Crazy&quot; (extra gory version) – 3:59
# &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; (instrumental) – 3:25

==Coolio&#x27;s response==
Yankovic sought permission from Coolio before making &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;, offering a percentage of the revenues. Yankovic was given rights to use the song by the record company (non-exclusive rights holders) and producer Doug Rasheed, but not by Coolio himself, who declined when presented with Weird Al&#x27;s offer and subsequently decried the release.

Yankovic later stated on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio, which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show suggests that Yankovic and Coolio had made amends. Coolio stated in a 2014 interview that the decision to refuse the parody at the time was &quot;stupid&quot; and he wished that someone on his management had stopped him, and then considered the final parody to be &quot;funny&quot;.

During an interview with Sean Evans on &quot;Hot Ones&quot; in 2016, Coolio further expressed regret for how he initially responded to &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;. &quot;In hindsight, it was stupid of me to say something about [Yankovic] doing a parody of &#x27;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, he did Michael Jackson, he did Prince. You know, people who were definitely more talented than I am. I think Prince did say something... but he wasn&#x27;t very vocal about it like I was. And it just made me look dumb... It was one of the dumb things I did. And I&#x27;m willing to admit I did something stupid.&quot;

==Music video==
Yankovic directed the music video for &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; himself, as he has done for many of his music videos since 1986. The music video for &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; closely mirrors the &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; music video, although several concepts are parodied. The video also features Florence Henderson as the Michelle Pfeiffer character from &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; in the original video. Yankovic said in 2022 that recording the Buster Keaton gag with the falling house frame was the scariest stunt he had ever done.

== Personnel ==
According to the liner notes of The Essential &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic:

* &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic – lead &amp; background vocals, choir vocals
* Steve Jay – bass guitar, synth bass, choir vocals
* Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz – drum programming
* Rubén Valtierra – synthesizers
* Lisa Popeil – choir vocals
* Jim West – choir vocals

==Chart performance==
==Rerecording==
In 2022, for the film &quot;&quot;, Yankovic rerecorded the track, as well as four others. In the film, Yankovic&#x27;s fictional father reveals that he was raised Amish, and Yankovic finds a lyric sheet written by his father called &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; and decides to perform the song.

<text>Los Gringos Locos (intended to mean &quot;The Crazy Americans&quot; in English) were a lucha libre stable in Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA). The stable was originally a tag team consisting of Eddie Guerrero and Art Barr.

==Gimmick==
&quot;Los Gringos Locos&quot; was intended to be the Mexican version of the Four Horsemen alliance in American promotion World Championship Wrestling. Because Barr was American and Guerrero was Mexican-American, they were able to draw heat from Mexican crowds as they acted more and more American. The team wore red, white, and blue wrestling attire.

==History==

===La Pareja del Terror===
The stable began as the tag team &quot;La Pareja del Terror&quot; (The Pair of Terror) made up of Eddy Guerrero and the &quot;Love Machine&quot; Art Barr.

At first the two men did not get along behind the scenes, but they decided to team up for business reasons. Guerrero, however, was teaming with El Hijo del Santo at the time. Guerrero&#x27;s brother Mando came up with the idea of Guerrero turning on Santo and aligning himself with Barr as villains. Barr and Guerrero met with AAA&#x27;s owner Antonio Peña, who gave them the green light on the storyline. The duo was originally known as the American Machine and then &quot;La Pareja del Terror&quot;, but their name was changed to &quot;Los Gringos Locos&quot; after the announcers said &quot;Those gringos are loco,&quot; in regards to the team. &quot;Los Gringos&quot; feuded primarily with El Hijo del Santo and Octagón. On November 5, 1993, Santo and Octagón defeated them to become the inaugural IWC/AAA World Tag Team Champions. Barr and Guerrero, however, defeated them for the championship in July. Meanwhile, as they continued to team together, Guerrero and Barr began to become good friends.

===Becoming a stable===
As &quot;Los Gringos Locos&quot; became more popular in Mexico, AAA&#x27;s owner Antonio Peña and top star Konnan decided to turn the team into an alliance of several wrestlers. Backstage, both Guerrero and Barr were against the idea of expanding the team, but agreed to it if they could have a say in who was allowed to join the stable. Konnan was the first to join the team, and at the suggestion of Guerrero and Barr, Black Cat was the second. The stable continued to grow to include Madonna&#x27;s Boyfriend (Louie Spicolli), Chicano Power, El Misterioso and King Lion. 

The team continued to feud with El Hijo del Santo and Octagón, but the rivalry ended in a Hair vs. Mask match at the first lucha pay-per-view in America, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, which they lost. Barr convinced Antonio Peña that he be included in the match, which was originally supposed to be Guerrero against Santo. Barr and Guerrero both received $7,500 for their part in the match.

In the United States, Paul Heyman, the promoter of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), began negotiating with Barr and Guerrero in hopes of bringing the team into his promotion. At the time, rumors circulated that Heyman planned to have Barr and Guerrero feud with The Public Enemy. The duo were looking to work outside of Mexico as the Peso had been devalued, which had caused a dramatic decrease in their pay. On November 23, 1994, Art Barr died from a drug-related heart attack. After his death, the team was forced to vacate the IWC/AAA World Tag Team Championship. The group eventually disbanded not long after. Guerrero took a brief hiatus from wrestling through the rest of 1994 until April 1995 where he appeared in ECW as a singles wrestler, defeating 2 Cold Scorpio to win the ECW TV Title in his debut match for the promotion. Guerrero also started using the Frog Splash in tribute to Art Barr. Guerrero would then go on and have worldwide success in WCW and WWE until his death in 2005.

In addition to Barr&#x27;s death in 1994 and Guerrero&#x27;s death in 2005, Louie Spicolli (1971-1998), King Lion (1968-2002) and Black Cat (1954-2006) have all died. Leaving Konnan as the only surviving member of Los Gringos Locos.

<text>Kamperveen is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Kampen, about 5 km south of the city.

Kamperveen was a separate municipality until 1937, when it became a part of IJsselmuiden.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 1236 as &quot;in Veno prope Campen&quot;, meaning &quot;the bog of Kampen&quot;, and was originally a peat colony.

Kamperveen is a confusing village, because it is a merger of the hamlets De Heuvels, De Roskam, De Zande, Hogeweg, Posthoorn and Zuideinde, therefore, it does not have a clear centre. There are directional signs to Kamperveen, however each hamlet is marked with its own name.

== Notable people ==
* Jan Terlouw (born 1931), politician and author

<doc id="998264" wikidata="Q1826225" url="?curid=998264" title="Lindis Pass">
<text>Lindis Pass () (elevation 971 m) is located in the South Island of New Zealand. A carpark at the top of the pass provides access to a viewpoint and two short trails to other viewing spots.

Lindis Pass lies between the towns of Cromwell (78 km, 55 minutes drive) in Central Otago and Omarama (32 km, 21 minutes drive) in North Otago, on the main inland route to the Waitaki Basin in the Otago Region.

The pass lies between the valleys of the Lindis and Ahuriri Rivers.
State Highway 8 transverses the pass on its route from the Waitaki Basin to Central Otago. The pass is the highest point on the South Island&#x27;s state highway network, and the second highest point on the New Zealand state highway network, after the Desert Road (SH 1) in the Central North Island. Despite this, it is not considered one of the alpine passes as it located in the dry interior of the South Island. Summers are typically hot and dry while heavy snow and frequent ice are common in winter. The Lindis had a web camera installed in 2018 to help ensure traffic controllers and maintenance crews can monitor the highway as well as informing travellers so they are prepared for road conditions. Vehicle crashes on the Lindis Pass have occurred regularly. There is no cell phone coverage on the Lindis Pass. The New Zealand Transport Agency has upgraded aspects of state highway 8 over Lindis Pass by installing new wire-rope safety barriers, improving signage and installing electronic speed warnings in 2013.

Lindis Pass is surrounded on all sides by grassland which comprises snow tussocks. Buttercups (&quot;ranunculus haastii&quot;) are very common on Longslip Mountain (1494 metres). The New Zealand falcon/kārearea, New Zealand pipit/pihoihoi and spotted skink can be seen in the Lindis Pass. The lower altitude beech forests and shrublands provide habitat for fantail/pīwakawaka, grey warbler/riroriro and rifleman/tītitipounamu.

<text>Lewis Pass is the northernmost of the three main mountain passes through the Southern Alps in the South Island of New Zealand. With an elevation of 907 metres, it is slightly lower than Arthur&#x27;s Pass and higher than Haast Pass.

The pass is the saddle between the valleys of the Maruia River to the northwest in the West Coast Region and the Lewis River to the southeast in north Canterbury. The small spa of Maruia Springs is close to the saddle, on the West Coast side.

Lewis Pass is named after Henry Lewis who, together with Christopher Maling, was the first European to discover the pass, in April 1860 while working as a surveyor of the Nelson Provincial Survey Department. Before this time the pass was used by the Ngāi Tahu Māori of Canterbury to transport pounamu (greenstone) from the west coast.

State Highway 7 traverses the pass. The road officially opened on Saturday 30 October 1937. It had a regular bus route over it until Intercity&#x27;s service was replaced by a seasonal shuttle.

The highway passes through extensive unmodified native beech forest. The area around the pass is protected as a national reserve, the Lewis Pass National Scenic Reserve, which was gazetted in 1981. There are a number of tramping routes in the Lewis Pass area, including the St James Walkway. The short Alpine Nature Walk loop walk around an alpine wetland and tarn is accessed from a carpark near the saddle.

<doc id="998297" wikidata="Q1797737" url="?curid=998297" title="L and M-class destroyer">
<text>The L and M class was a class of sixteen destroyers which served in the British Royal Navy during World War II. The ships of the class were launched between 1939 and 1942.

The L class (also known as the &quot;Laforeys&quot;) were approved under the 1937 Naval Estimates. Four of these ships (&quot;Lance&quot;, &quot;Lively&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot; and &quot;Larne&quot;) were built with armament instead of 4.7 inch. Six of the eight were war losses, with the surviving pair being broken up in 1948.

The M Class were built under the 1939 Naval Estimates. They served in the Home Fleet until 1944 and then went to the Mediterranean. Three were wartime losses; of the five survivors, the &quot;Musketeer&quot; was broken up in 1955 and the other four sold to Turkey in 1958.

==Design details==
The armament of the class was subject of considerable debate, as the proponents of heavier anti-aircraft armaments for such vessels were at last beginning to be listened to by the Admiralty. This came mainly as a result of the lessons learned during the Spanish Civil War – &quot;i.e&quot;., military aircraft were now sufficiently advanced to pose a major threat to land and sea targets.

The ships of the L and M class had single funnels, like the previous J class, a tripod foremast and a short mainmast just aft of amidships. One feature of note was the bridge design. From the to the , all Royal Navy destroyers shared a distinctive wedge-shaped face to the bridge, incorporating a bulletproof wheelhouse, raised for the helmsman to see over the guns. The increased height of the new gunhouses of the L class meant that the wheelhouse was raised further and the sloped roof of the wheelhouse (to direct the airflow over the compass platform) was almost flat. This feature was unique to the Ls and Ms.

The class comprised a leader and seven destroyers. Each ship was to mount six guns and eight torpedo tubes. Close range armament had still to be decided, with the expected time of delivery being a crucial factor. They were the first British destroyers to have their guns in fully enclosed mountings. They also continued the practice (first introduced in the Js) of making the leader almost indistinguishable from the rest of the class, having only more extensive cabin accommodation and better radio (wireless telegraph, W/T) equipment.

=== Main armament ===
The ships were to have six QF Mark XI guns in Mark XX twin mountings in &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, and &#x27;X&#x27; positions. The &#x27;X&#x27; mount gave an estimated arc of fire of 320 degrees at low elevations and 360 degrees at elevations above around 20 degrees. The Mark XI gun was a big improvement on the previous version in that it threw a shell (compared to the shell in the preceding J class). The Mark XX mount was fully enclosed and supposedly weatherproof; in service, crews found otherwise. It also allowed the guns to be elevated independently. The Mark XX was not technically a turret, as the ammunition feed system was distinct from the weapon mounting, and did not train with the revolving mass. This meant that ammunition supply when the guns were at the limit of training was somewhat difficult. This also meant that the ammunition hoists had to be located between the guns just as in the USN 5&quot; guns. The axes of the guns were very widely spaced, a feature instantly obvious with the Mark XX mounting.

The Mark XX mounting permitted an increased elevation to 50 degrees (compared to 40 for previous marks) but this still limited the engagement time against enemy aircraft, although medium calibre guns posed little threat to dive bombers prior to the use of radar proximity fuzed ammunition. The Imperial Japanese Navy had already introduced a 5-inch (127 mm) gun with 70-degree elevation into service which had very poor performance as an anti-aircraft weapon, while the United States Navy&#x27;s 5&quot;/38 cal Mark 32 mount could elevate to 85 degrees. The 4.5-inch (114 mm) guns fitted to were already in service and capable of elevations of 80 degrees, although the mountings were not suitable for a destroyer-sized ship. Coupled with the lack of powered elevation, the Mark XX mounting was compromised in its chosen anti-aircraft role, although it compared favourably with similar Axis weapons.

Another development regarding the main armament was the adoption of a combined high-angle/low-angle director tower, the HA/LA Mk.IV (TP). This was never entirely satisfactory in the HA mode, and was at least a ton overweight. It was later reworked, somewhat unsuccessfully again, as the Mk.I &quot;K tower&quot; of the Z class. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer. Despite its problems, the L and M class&#x27; director tower and its Type 285 radar provided better high-angle fire control than any similar Axis destroyer, the vast majority of which did not have any high-angle fire control system, much less a specialised AA fire control radar.

As originally ordered, the class had no close-range armament as the various departments could not agree on what to fit. Arguments raged as to the effectiveness of mounting one or two four-barrelled 2-pounder &quot;pom poms&quot;, one pom-pom and one of the multiple machine guns then in development, one pom-pom and the traditional 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Vickers machine gun. The argument was exacerbated by the manufacturing schedules (a second pom-pom per ship would not be available until 1942), the poor performance of the development models of the 0.661 and a number of younger officers (led by Lord Louis Mountbatten) dissatisfied with anti-aircraft weaponry. Eventually, development of the 0.661 was dropped as it clearly would not be available quickly enough and this simplified the arguments somewhat.

The outbreak of war focused minds. Apart from the AA armament issue concerns started to be raised about progress generally. By February 1940 the two factors led to a proposal to change the design of four of the &#x27;L&#x27;s and fit a main armament of 4-inch (102 mm) Mark XVI* guns in Mark XIX High Angle/Low Angle (HA/LA) twin mounts as used as secondary armament in the s already in service and main armament in the of sloops under construction. Associated changes were provision of two quadruple 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns. All ships of this class except &quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;Laforey&quot; carried a four-barrel 2-pounder pom-pom.

The lessons of the Norwegian campaign and the Battle of Dunkirk drove home the need for this change and it was agreed in July 1940 that there were also to be four of the twin mounts instead of the originally proposed three. The fourth was to be at the forward end of the after superstructure which cut down on the fire arcs of both mounts but ensured the fourth would still be available for use in heavy weather. Not all senior officers were in favour and some said that it would mean the ships could not fight their foreign equivalents. Experience in the Mediterranean, especially that of Force K which contained two of the 4-inch (102 mm) &#x27;L&#x27;s, showed that the loss of gun power against surface targets was balanced against a higher rate of fire.

Review of AA armament continued and in October a decision was taken to remove the after bank of torpedo tubes and fit a 4-inch (102 mm) HA gun instead and that is how the gunned ships eventually went to sea, although some surviving ships, including &quot;Matchless&quot; and &quot;Marne&quot;, had the after tubes replaced later in the war.

==Proposed conversion==
In the early 1950s, it was proposed to convert the five remaining ships of the M class, together with seven War Emergency Programme destroyers to Type 62 Air Direction Frigates. The conversion would have involved replacement of the ships&#x27; armament and sensors. The initial proposal would have armed the ships with a twin 4-inch gun mount, a twin 40 mm Bofors gun and a Squid anti-submarine mortar. Type 982 and 983 air direction radars would be fitted, as would Type 162 and 166 sonars. In March 1952, the programme was reduced, as the War Emergency Destroyers were too small to accommodate the heavy radars. Later that year, it was decided to substitute a US twin 3&quot;/50 caliber gun mount for the 4-inch guns. The project was finally abandoned in May 1954, partly owing to the condition of the ships and poor shock-resistance.

==Ships==

===L class===
The L class (also known as the &quot;Laforey&quot;s) were approved under the 1937 Naval Estimates. Four of these ships (&quot;Lance&quot;, &quot;Lively&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot; and &quot;Larne&quot;) were built with armament. Six of the eight were war losses, with the surviving pair being broken up in 1948.

===M class===

The M Class were built under the 1939 Naval Estimates. They served in the Home Fleet until 1944 and then went to the Mediterranean. Three were wartime losses; of the five survivors, the &quot;Musketeer&quot; was broken up in 1955 and the other four sold to Turkey in 1958.

<text>Manapouri is a small town in Southland / Fiordland, in the southwest corner of the South Island, in New Zealand. The township is the westernmost municipality in New Zealand. Located at the edge of the Fiordland National Park, on the eastern shore of Lake Manapouri, close to its outflow into the Waiau River, tourist boat services are based in the town.

Manapouri township is a 20-minute drive from Te Anau via The town is the gateway to both Doubtful Sound and Dusky Sound and the starting point for many local walking tracks. It is a popular tourist destination, particularly during the summer months. 

== History ==
At the intersection of State Highway 95 and Hillside Road is a monument to the Save Manapouri campaign which marks the first mass environmental movement in New Zealand history.

The Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station is located on the West Arm of Lake Manapouri, with most of the electricity generated serving the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter Workers at the power plant are ferried by boat from Manapouri, as there is no road access to the power station. Manapouri was declared the &quot;highest consumer of water&quot; in New Zealand in 2010 because of the power station, which consumes 41 percent of the fresh water consumed by the entire country. In 2002, the Government rejected an application of a business, Southland Water 2000, to bottle 40,000 cubic metres of water in 20 hours, twelve times a year, before the water from the power station is released into Doubtful Sound.

==Demographics==
Manapouri is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers , and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the larger Mararoa statistical area.
Manapouri had a population of 222 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 21 people (10.4%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 72 people (−24.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 102 households, comprising 117 males and 108 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.08 males per female. The median age was 56.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 21 people (9.5%) aged under 15 years, 30 (13.5%) aged 15 to 29, 111 (50.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 63 (28.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 94.6% European/Pākehā, 9.5% Māori, 1.4% Asian, and 4.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 54.1% had no religion, 41.9% were Christian and 2.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 30 (14.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 51 (25.4%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $30,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. 15 people (7.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 108 (53.7%) people were employed full-time, and 36 (17.9%) were part-time.

== Facilities and attractions ==
Commercial services include a petrol station/garage, art gallery, cafes, shops, two restaurant and bars as well as overnight hotel, motel and motor camp accommodations. The small Te Anau Airport is situated north of the township and serves both Te Anau and Manapouri.

There are several tourist boat excursions based in Manapouri to service the Fiordland Sounds to fishing charters and boat hire. Excursions originating at Pearl Harbour at the southern end of Manapouri township take tourists across Lake Manapouri to view the underground hydroelectric facility, or continue on by bus over Wilmot Pass to boat tours of Doubtful Sound, adding up to a full day trip.
=== Walkways and cycleways ===
Day walks are the Circle Track, the Hope Arm Track, the Shallow Bay portion of the Kepler Track and the Frazers Beach Reserve walkways.

A natural monument, in the form of Monument Hill, lies across the lake from the township. This sharply pointed landmark beneath the Hunter Mountains to the west on Manapouri township is a prized destination for adventurous trampers.

The Lake2Lake Trail is a cycle trail that starts at Te Anau and follows the Waiau River to Lake Manapouri. The trail is 28.5 kilometres long.
=== Kayaking ===
The eastern end of Lake Manapouri is open for kayak exploration, with 20 islands and many coves, beaches, lagoons, waterfalls, huts, portages and channels with in a day&#x27;s return paddled from Manapouri township.

===&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; filming locations===
Manapouri was a site of filming for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. During a late snowstorm one November, Manapouri Hall was used to film the scene in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; in which Frodo, Samwise and Gollum attempt to enter the black gates of Mordor. According to Jackson, the townspeople only asked for a small fee for the film crew to use the hall but the production gifted a large sum for the refurbishment of the hall and in acknowledgement of the town&#x27;s generosity. The crew was not allowed to use large granite boulders located in the forest near Lake Manapouri and instead created artificial rocks, two of which were gifted to the townspeople. Other locations near the town were used for filming, including the Kepler Mire (for panning, aerial shots of the Dead Marshes and other swamps), Waiau River (for various shots of the River Anduin) and Norwest Lakes (for the iconic shot of the fellowship traversing mountain peaks). It is also rumoured that locations in the Fiordland National Park were used in &quot;The Ring of Power&quot; season one, as a film crew were spotted near Manapouri.

=== Wee Bookshop ===
Manapouri is home to the Wee Bookshop, made famous through the memoir of Ruth Shaw&#x27;s. The bookshops were built in 2020 and originally sold titles about the local region and conservation. It now consists of three tiny bookshops - one for adults, a smaller one for children, and now one for the blokes.

==Climate==
Manapouri has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification with mild summers and cool to cold winters. In a typical winter season, snowfalls and snow on the ground are likely on a handful of occasions.

<doc id="998327" wikidata="Q3308814" url="?curid=998327" title="Alan Freeman">
<text>Alan Leslie Freeman MBE (6 July 1927 – 27 November 2006), nicknamed &quot;Fluff&quot;, was an Australian-born British disc jockey and radio personality in the United Kingdom for 40 years, best known for presenting &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; from 1961 to 2000.

== Early life ==
Born and educated in Melbourne, Australia, Freeman worked as an assistant paymaster/accountant for one of Australia&#x27;s largest timber companies after leaving school. He wanted to be an opera singer, but decided his voice was not strong enough.

==Career==

=== Radio and television ===
Freeman was invited to audition as a radio announcer in 1952, and began work for 7LA in Tasmania, known as the teenagers&#x27; station. Freeman&#x27;s duties included continuity announcer, presenter of musical programmes incorporating opera, ballet and classical music, DJ for the top 100, news reader, quizmaster and commercials reader.

After moving to radio station 3KZ in Melbourne, he took a nine-month trip around the world in 1957, with the promise to return to Melbourne by January 1958. He arrived in London, and on deciding to stay wrote numerous letters of delay, and later apology, to his former employer.

Freeman began his British career as a summer relief disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg and continued to present late evening programmes on the station until the early 1970s.

In 1960 he moved to the BBC Light Programme as presenter of the &quot;Records Around Five&quot; show, introduced by his signature tune, &quot;At the Sign of the Swingin&#x27; Cymbal&quot;, written by Brian Fahey. A more upbeat version performed by Brass Incorporated was introduced in April 1970. In September 1961, he introduced &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; as part of Saturday evening show &quot;Trad Tavern&quot;. &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; became a permanent show in its own right; Freeman presented it until 24 September 1972, continuing with his &#x27;Swingin&#x27; Cymbal&#x27; signature tune.

During this time he was one of the original team of presenters of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, a regular member of the &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; panel, and had a brief stint as compère of the lunchtime pop music show &quot;Go Man Go&quot; on the Light Programme in 1963. In 1961 and 1962, he presented the British version of the hit American quiz &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot; on BBC TV. He presented a music magazine-style television show for the BBC in 1968, &quot;All Systems Freeman&quot;, which aired for several weeks on Friday evening, but despite good reviews did not return for a second series.

Freeman recorded a dance single, &quot;Madison Time&quot;, with the Talmy Stone Band in 1962. Released by Decca Records, F11523, it was reportedly one of the label&#x27;s worst-ever sellers.

In April 1972, he joined the daily presenters on Radio 1, taking over the 3–5 pm show from Terry Wogan. Freeman used &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot; by Quincy Jones as his theme until 1 June 1973. During this time he spotlighted youth clubs and young people, and became Vice-President of the London Association of Youth Clubs. During the 1970s he also presented the Radio 1 series &quot;Quiz Kid&quot; on Sunday evenings, recorded at youth clubs and boys&#x27; clubs all over the country, while on Saturday afternoons he presented a programme simply titled Alan Freeman, although retrospectively it is mainly referred to as The Rock Show. It featured an eclectic mix of music, although it is mainly remembered for pioneering heavy and progressive rock. It also featured a rundown of the current album chart. The show ran from 30 June 1973 to 26 August 1978.

He presented the original version of &quot;The Story of Pop&quot; as a 26-part Radio 1 series in 1973–74. From 1975 to 1977, Freeman presented the Radio 2 musical game show &quot;Free Spin&quot;. In addition he lent his name to several rock and classical compilation albums, the best-known being &quot;By Invitation Only&quot; (1976), a collection of material sourced from artists on the Atlantic label.

Freeman left the BBC to work for Capital Radio from 1979 to 1989, presenting the Top 40 of the 1970s on 31 December 1979 under the revived Pick of the Pops name. He again revived &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; from 13 March 1982 (now called &quot;Pick of the Pops Take Two&quot;, combining the current NME Top 15 with an earlier chart) and &quot;The Rock Show&quot; previous to that on 7 January 1980. He returned to the BBC and Radio 1 on 15 January 1989 to revive &quot;The Rock Show&quot; and &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;. This run of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; ended on 27 December 1992 but he continued to host &quot;The Rock Show&quot; until 23 October 1993, when he, with other long-serving DJs, left the station as it was revamped by controller Matthew Bannister.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1987 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios. In 1990, he appeared as a celebrity guest on the television series &quot;You Bet!&quot;, made by London Weekend Television and hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth.

In December 1993, for four weeks he presented the &quot;Alternative Chart Show&quot; Top 30 as part of a trial one-off Restricted Service Licence (RSL) broadcast by XFM in London. Throughout 1994 he presented a revised and expanded version of the Radio 1 series &quot;The Story of Pop&quot;, broadcast in 52-hour-long episodes. He then hosted &quot;Pick of the Pops Take Three&quot; on Capital Gold from April 1994 until January 1997. In 1996 and 1997 he also hosted &quot;The Friday Rock Show&quot; on Virgin Radio, and he hosted a number of one-off shows on Classic FM from December 1993 to December 1996.

In 1998 he was awarded the MBE for services to broadcasting.

He returned to the BBC on Radio 2, taking &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; back to its home, from 1997 until 2000. A lifetime love of classical music and particularly opera was developed in the show &quot;Their Greatest Bits&quot;, which resulted in another compilation CD on the BBC label. Throughout his career, he was known especially for his jingles, which integrated short bursts of classical music and hard rock segued together, as well as his catchphrases, which included &quot;Hi there, pop pickers!&quot; at the start of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;; &quot;Greetings, music lovers!&quot; when introducing his classical and rock shows; &quot;All right? Right, stay bright!&quot; when signing off, and &quot;Not &#x27;arf!&quot; frequently uttered during his shows.

In April 2000, after arthritis in his hands had started to make it too difficult for him to operate studio equipment, he handed &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; over to Dale Winton.

New editions of Their Greatest Bits continued to be recorded by Freeman until 2001.

=== Acting ===
Freeman acted in the horror film &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965) and the rock musical &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986), and played himself or a similar character in films such as &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; (1962), &quot;Just for Fun&quot; (1963) and &quot;Sebastian&quot; (1968). He also played God (albeit a God who sat at a mixing desk and said &quot;Alright?&quot;) in two episodes of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; in 1984. Freeman also appeared in TV advertisements for Brentford Nylons and for Omo &quot;with exclusive WM7 for perfect whiteness.&quot;

He appeared in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; at the Adeline Genee Theatre in East Grinstead in June 1968, starring alongside Shirley Anne Field, Sally Anne Howe and Conrad Phillips.

=== Recognition ===
Freeman&#x27;s style has been parodied, and he was the model for comedian Harry Enfield&#x27;s character Dave Nice, although he contributed to the satire himself in good grace by appearing on Enfield&#x27;s show. (Enfield praised Freeman in Simon Garfield&#x27;s book on Radio 1, &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite&quot;, by categorising him along with John Peel as &quot;DJs who loved music&quot; as opposed to &quot;DJs who loved the sound of their own voices, like Dave Lee Travis&quot;).

For all Freeman&#x27;s supposed clichés and archetypes in his broadcasting style, he has been regarded as original by fellow broadcasters. When he appeared on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, Peel said: &quot;Fluff is the greatest out-and-out disc jockey of them all&quot;.

After Freeman&#x27;s death Robin Gibb wrote a tribute, &quot;Alan Freeman Days&quot;. Recorded in August 2007, the song was included on Gibb&#x27;s first posthumous album &quot;50 St. Catherine&#x27;s Drive&quot; in 2014.

Black Sabbath dedicated the instrumental track &quot;Fluff&quot; on &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; (composed by Tony Iommi) to Freeman, since he was one of the few radio personalities in Great Britain to play the group&#x27;s music on-air.

In an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Great Lives&quot; broadcast in January 2024, Freeman was the choice of Simon Mayo.

==Honours==
He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1998. In May 2000, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement award at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. He was initiated into the Grand Order of Water Rats in 1976, and ten years later was elected &quot;King Rat&quot;. He also served as Vice-President of the London Union of Youth Clubs.

==Personal life==
In March 1994, Freeman revealed on breakfast television that he had become celibate in 1981, but had previously been bisexual. He was described by Graham Chapman as being &quot;keen on motor bikes and leather and men&quot;.

From the early 1990s, Freeman suffered from arthritis and asthma (from a 60-a-day smoking habit) and used a Zimmer frame. He lived at Brinsworth House, a retirement home for actors and performers run by the Entertainment Artistes&#x27; Benevolent Fund in Twickenham, from 2000 until his death.

==Death==
He died on 27 November 2006 in Brinsworth House, aged 79, after a short illness. His funeral took place at South West Middlesex Crematorium on 7 December 2006, and was attended by singer Kenny Lynch, his producer Phil Swern and DJs including Dave Lee Travis, Ed Stewart, Dave Cash, Paul McKenna, Nicky Campbell, Paul Gambaccini and his Radio One Top 40 successors Wes Butters, Simon Bates and Richard Skinner.

<text>Francesco Filelfo (; 25 July 1398 – 31 July 1481) was an Italian Renaissance humanist and author of the philosophic dialogue &quot;On Exile&quot;.

==Biography==

Filelfo was born at Tolentino, in the March of Ancona. He is believed to be a third cousin of Leonardo da Vinci. At the time of his birth, Petrarch and the students of Florence had already begun to exalt the recovery of classic texts and culture. They had created an eager appetite for the antique, had rediscovered many important Roman authors, and had freed Latin scholarship to some extent from the restrictions of earlier periods. Filelfo was destined to carry on their work in the field of Latin literature and as an agent in the still unaccomplished recovery of Greek culture.

===In Venice===
His earliest studies in grammar, rhetoric and the Latin language were conducted at Padua under the Humanist educator Gasparino Barzizza. During these studies, Filelfo acquired so great a reputation for learning that in 1417, when he was eighteen, he was invited to teach eloquence and moral philosophy at Venice. According to the custom of that age in Italy, it became his duty to explain the language, and to illustrate the beauties of the principal Latin authors, with Cicero and Virgil considered the chief masters of moral science and of elegant diction.

He was admitted to the society of the first scholars and the most eminent nobles. In 1419 he received an appointment from the state, which enabled him to reside as notary and chancellor to the Baile of the Venetians in Constantinople. This appointment was an honour for Filelfo as a man of trust and general ability, and gave him the opportunity of acquiring the most coveted of all possessions at that moment — a scholar&#x27;s knowledge of the Greek language. Immediately after his arrival in Constantinople at the end of 1420, Filelfo placed himself under the tuition of John Chrysoloras, whose name was already well known in Italy as that of his uncle Manuel Chrysoloras, the first Greek to profess the literature of his ancestors in Florence.

He assumed his charge of chancellor for the bailo Benedetto Emo (summer 1421 to summer 1423), with diplomatic missions. In late 1421, he accompanied Emo during an embassy to the Ottoman Sultan Murad II, who was the candidate supported by Venice for the succession of the late Sultan Mehmed I. In contrast, the Byzantines supported the candidacy of the pretender Mustafa. This would have been difficult for the pupil of John Chrysoloras. The final victory of Murad II resulted in the siege of Constantinople in spring 1422. It was during the great assault of 22 August 1422 that his professor, mortally ill, dictated to him his will. Nominated executor of this will with the widow of the dead, Manfredina Doria, he was also designated tutor of Chrysoloras&#x27; girls. After the completion of his term as chancellor in July 1423, he entered the service of the emperor John VIII Palaeologus who sent him immediately to Sigismond, King of Hungary. Before his departure, his marriage with Theodora, the daughter of John Chrysoloras, and Manfredina Doria, was decided, and was concluded when he returned from Hungary after sixteenth months of absence (end October 1424). With a new teacher, Chrysococes, he acquired a thorough knowledge of Greek and formed a large collection of Greek manuscripts. In 1427, he accepted an invitation from the Venetian Republic, and set sail for Italy, intending to resume his professorial career. From this time forward until the date of his death, Filelfo&#x27;s biography consists of a record of the various towns in which he lectured, the masters whom he served, the books he wrote, the authors he illustrated, the friendships he contracted, and the wars he waged with rival scholars. He was a man of vast physical energy, of inexhaustible mental activity, of quick passions and violent appetites; vain, restless, greedy of gold and pleasure and fame; unable to stay quiet in one place, and perpetually engaged in quarrels with his peers.

===In Tuscany===
When Filelfo arrived at Venice with his family in 1427, he found the city had almost been emptied by the plague. He therefore moved to Bologna; but the city was too much disturbed with political dissensions to attend to him; so Filelfo crossed the Apennines and settled in Florence. During the week he lectured to large audiences of young and old on the principal Greek and Latin authors, and on Sundays he explained Dante to the people in the Duomo.

In addition to these labours of the chair, he found time to translate portions of Aristotle, Plutarch, Xenophon and Lysias from the Greek. Nor was he dead to the claims of society. At first, he seems to have lived with the Florentine scholars on tolerably good terms; but he was so arrogant that Cosimo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s friends were not long able to put up with him. Filelfo hereupon broke out into open and violent animosity; and when Cosimo was exiled by the Albizzi party in 1433, he urged the &quot;signoria&quot; of Florence to pronounce upon him the sentence of death. On the return of Cosimo to Florence, Filelfo&#x27;s position in that city was no longer tenable. His life, he asserted, had been already once attempted by a cut-throat in the pay of the Medici; and now he readily accepted an invitation from the state of Siena. In Siena, however, he was not destined to remain more than four years. His fame as a professor had grown great in Italy, and he daily received tempting offers from princes and republics. The most alluring of these, made him by the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, he decided to accept; and in 1440 he was received with honour by his new master in the capital of Lombardy.

===In Lombardy===

Filelfo&#x27;s life at Milan curiously illustrates the multifarious importance of the scholars of that age in Italy. It was his duty to celebrate his princely patrons in panegyrics and epics, to abuse their enemies in libels and invectives, to salute them with encomiastic odes on their birthdays, and to compose poems on their favorite themes. For their courtiers he wrote epithalamial and funeral orations; ambassadors and visitors from foreign states he greeted with the rhetorical lucubrations then so much in vogue. The students of the university he taught in daily lectures, passing in review the weightiest and lightest authors of antiquity, and pouring forth a flood of miscellaneous erudition.

Not satisfied with these outlets for his mental energy, Filelfo went on translating from the Greek, and prosecuted a paper warfare with his enemies in Florence. He wrote, moreover, political pamphlets on the great events of Italian history; and when Constantinople was taken by the Turks, he procured the liberation of his wife&#x27;s mother, Manfredina Doria, by a message addressed in his own name to the &quot;sultan&quot;. In addition to a fixed stipend of some 700 golden florins yearly, he was continually in receipt of special payments for the orations and poems he produced; so that, had he been a man of frugal habits or of moderate economy, he might have amassed a considerable fortune. As it was, he spent his money as fast as he received it, living in a style of splendour and self-indulgence. In consequence of this prodigality, he was always poor. His letters and his poems abound in demands for money from patrons, some of them couched in language of the lowest adulation, and others savouring of literary brigandage.

During the second year of his Milanese residence Filelfo lost his first wife, the Greek Theodora. He soon married again; and this time he chose for his bride a young lady of good Lombard family, called Orsina Osnaga. When she died he took in wedlock for the third time a woman of Lombard birth, Laura Magiolini.

On the death of Visconti in 1447, Filelfo, after a short hesitation, transferred his allegiance to Francesco Sforza, husband of Bianca, Visconti&#x27;s only child, who would become Duke of Milan in 1450. In order to curry favor with this &quot;parvenu&quot;, he began his ponderous epic, the &quot;Sforziad&quot;, of which 12,800 lines were written, but which was never published. Some years after the deaths of Francesco and Bianca (1466 and 1468, respectively), Filelfo turned his thoughts towards Rome. He was now an old man of seventy-seven years, honored with the friendship of princes, recognised as the most distinguished of Italian humanists, courted by pontiffs, and decorated with the laurel wreath and the order of knighthood by kings.

Crossing the Apennines and passing through Florence, he reached Rome in the second week of 1475. Pope Sixtus IV now ruled in the Vatican, and Filelfo had received an invitation to occupy the chair of rhetoric with good emoluments. At first he was pleased with the city and court of Rome; but his satisfaction turned to discontent, and he gave vent to his ill-humour in a venomous satire on the pope&#x27;s treasurer, Milliardo Cicala. Sixtus himself soon fell under the ban of his displeasure; and when a year had passed he left Rome never to return. Filelfo reached Milan to find that his wife had died of the plague in his absence, and was already buried.

===Return to Tuscany===
For some time past he had been desirous of displaying his abilities and adding to his fame in Florence. Years had healed the breach between him and the Medici family; and on the occasion of the Pazzi conspiracy against the life of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, he had sent violent letters of abuse to his papal patron Sixtus, denouncing his participation in a plot so dangerous to the security of Italy. Lorenzo now invited him to profess Greek at Florence, and so Filelfo went there in 1481. Two weeks after his arrival he succumbed to dysentery, and was buried at the age of eighty-three in the Church of the Annunziata.

A complete edition of Filelfo&#x27;s Greek letters (based on the &quot;Codex Trevulzianus&quot;) was published for the first time, with French translation, notes and commentaries, by Emile Legrand in 1892 at Paris (C. xii. of &quot;Publications de l&#x27;école des lang. orient.&quot;).

<text>Clive Ali Chimmo Branson (1907 – 25 February 1944) was an English artist and poet, and an active communist in the 1930s. A number of his paintings are in the Tate Gallery. His wife was Noreen Branson (16 May 1910 – 25 October 2003). Their daughter is the artist Rosa Branson (born 1933).

== Life ==

He was an active recruiter for the International Brigade, and himself fought in the Spanish Civil War from January 1938, being captured at Calaceite on 31 March 1938. As a prisoner of war at the Nationalist camp of San Pedro de Cardeña, he painted and sketched the camp and many of its inmates, at the request of the authorities; some of this work survives in the Marx Memorial Library in London.

He married Noreen Browne in 1931. Their daughter Rosa Branson was born in 1933. He died in action in Burma on 25 February 1944, where he was serving as a Sergeant in the British Army, as part of the 54th Training Regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps.

Branson was killed commanding an M3 Lee tank of B Squadron, 25th Dragoons. He was hit a glancing but fatal blow on the back of the head by a Japanese anti-tank shell near Point 315 at the end of the Battle of the Admin Box. Branson was a popular man in the unit and his crew &quot;were inconsolable&quot;. His friend, the composer Bernard Stevens, dedicated his 1945 &quot;Symphony of Liberation&quot; to the memory of Branson.

<text>Filippo Maria Visconti (3 September 1392 – 13 August 1447) was the duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. Reports stated that he was &quot;paranoid&quot;, but &quot;shrewd as a ruler.&quot; He went to war in the 1420s with Romagna, Florence, and Venice in the Wars in Lombardy but was eventually forced to surrender under Pope Martin V. He would return to war again, where another peace agreement was required to stop the war. He married twice and his second wife was Marie, whom he married in 1448. Marie was the daughter of his ally Amadeus VIII. When he died, Fillippo was the last of the Visconti male line and was succeeded by Francesco Sforza, husband to his natural daughter Bianca Maria Visconti, birth by his mistress Agnese del Maino. 

==Biography==
In 1402, when Filippo Maria was ten years old, his father died from plague, and his brother, 14-year-old Gian Maria, became the new Duke of Milan. Their mother Caterina worked for her son. 

Gian Maria, however, was through the interference of people close to him. He therefore came to regard Caterina as threat to his power. On 18 August 1404, he had their mother imprisoned at Monza, where she died on 17 October 1404, the death was rumored to be caused by poison. 

Filippo Maria Visconti became ruler of Pavia in 1402, succeeding his assassinated brother Gian Maria Visconti as Duke of Milan in 1412. 

After the assassination of Gian Maria (16 May 1412) and her brother Condottiero Faucino Cane, Filippo Maria occupied himself to Condottiero&#x27;s widow Beatrice Cane. In doing so, he acquired control over Condottiero&#x27;s wealth and his armies urging him to gain control over Milan. 

Filippo Maria was the brother of the deceased Gian Maria, the legal heir, as the son of Gian Galeazzo, who had usurped the lordship of Milan by overthrowing and murdering his uncle and father-in-law Bernabo Visconti, known as the maternal grandfather of Filippo Maria. Therefore, his succession to the lordship of Milan was opposed by other people, like his uncle Estorre Visconti and his cousin Giancarlo Visconti, who wa an illegitimate son and legitimate grandson of Bernabo Visconti. 

They had support by the Milanese people themselves, just after the death of Gian Maria. They would hold the title until the 16 June of that same year, when Filippo Maria managed to retake the city.

That same year, he confiscated several properties belonging to the Scotti family, including the Agazzano Castle. From Filippo&#x27;s marriage to Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda, Countess of Biandrate and the widow of Facino Cane—the condottiere who had power between the factions of Filippo&#x27;s elder brother and his mother, and Caterina Visconti, the regent—Filippo Maria received half a million florins; but when Beatrice was interested in the affairs of state, he accused her of adultery and had her beheaded at the castle of Binasco in 1418.

Despite reports of self-hate, he was purportedly a good politician, and by employing &quot;condottieri&quot; to Carmagnola, Piccinino—where his troops were stationed at the Battle of Anghiari, in 1440— and with Francesco Sforza, he managed to recover the Lombard portion of his father&#x27;s duchy.

Upon the death of Giorgio Ordelaffi, lord of Forlì, he took advantage of his guardianship of the boy heir, Tebaldo Ordelaffi, to attempt conquests in Romagna (1423), starting a war with Florence. Venice, urged on by Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola, decided to intervene on the side of Florence (1425) and the war spread to Lombardy. In March 1426 Carmagnola fomented riots in Brescia, which he had conquered for Visconti just five years previously. After a long campaign, Venice conquered Brescia, extending its mainland possessions to the western shores of Lake Garda. Filippo Maria unsuccessfully sought imperial aid but was constrained to accept the peace proposed by Pope Martin V, favouring Venice and Carmagnola. The terms were grudgingly accepted in Milan and by the emperor; but hostilities were resumed at the first pretext by Filippo Maria, leading to the defeat of Maclodio (12 October 1427), followed by a more lasting peace signed at Ferrara with the mediation of Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, Marquis of Ferrara.

The following year the duke married his second wife, Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan, daughter of Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy, who was an ally. With Visconti&#x27;s support, Amadeus reigned as antipope Felix V from November 1439 to April 1449.

He invited the famous scholar Gasparino Barzizza to establish a school in Milan. Barzizza would also serve as his court orator.

He died in 1447. He was the last of the Visconti family&#x27;s in direct male line, and was succeeded in the duchy, after the short-lived Ambrosian republic, by Francesco Sforza (1401–1466). In 1441, Francesco married Filippo Maria&#x27;s only heir, his natural daughter Bianca Maria (1425–1468) by his mistress Agnese del Maino (1401–1465).

<text>The Muskrat River is a river in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada that flows into the Ottawa River at the city of Pembroke.

==Course==
The river begins at Edmunds Lake, one of the Champlain Trail Lakes and near the community of Garden of Eden, and heads northwest through other Champlain Trail lakes to reach the largest, Jeffrys Lake. It continues northwest, loops under Ontario Highway 17, and takes in the right tributary Buttermilk Creek just before reaching Muskrat Lake at the community of Cobden. There, the left tributary Snake River joins. The river exits the lake near the community of Meath Hill, and continues northwest, looping west and east again under Ontario Highway 17 while taking the left tributary Mud Creek at Mud Lake, and then takes in the left tributary Indian River before reaching its mouth at the Ottawa River at Pembroke.

==Economy==
The river once provided hydroelectric power for Pembroke.

==Ecology==
In the fall, thousands of swallows gather at the mouth of this river before continuing their migration south.

<doc id="998342" wikidata="Q2501404" url="?curid=998342" title="Motorola MC14500B">
<text>The MC14500B Industrial Control Unit (ICU) is a CMOS one-bit microprocessor designed by Motorola for simple control applications in 1977. 

== Overview ==
MC14500B (ICU) is well-suited to the implementation of ladder logic, and thus could be used to replace relay systems and programmable logic controllers, also intended for serial data manipulation. The processor supports 16 commands, operating at a frequency of 1 MHz. The MC14500B unit does not include a program counter (PC); instead, a clock signal drives a separate PC chip; therefore the size of supported memory is dependent on the implementation of that chip. It was still in production in 1995.

The ICU architecture is similar to that of the DEC PDP-14 computer.

== Developers ==
The ICU was conceived by Vern Gregory in the mid-1970s while working as an engineer in a marketing / applications group of Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector in Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Brian Dellande originated circuit and sub-routine designs, and co-wrote the manual; Ray DiSilvestro was the bench technician; Terry Malarkey provided management support.

In the CMOS Logic Division in Austin, Texas, USA (where it was made) Phil Smith was the chip designer; Mike Hadley provided product applications support.

== Derivatives ==
A form of the design served as an embedded controller in a custom automotive chip made for Nippon Denso by Motorola—Japan. 

I.P.R.S. Băneasa manufactured a clone of the MC14500B with the designation βP14500 in IIL technology (rather than the original CMOS).

== Notable uses ==
One of the computers known to be based on this processor is the educational WDR 1-bit computer (512 bits of RAM, LED, I/O, keyboard).

A modern take, in retro style, of a computer based on this processor is the PLC14500-Nano. It is certified as Open Source Hardware PL000011 so anyone can learn from its design and can freely build it.

<doc id="998344" wikidata="Q1755035" url="?curid=998344" title="Shotover River">
<text>The Shotover River () is located in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. The name correctly suggests that this long river is fast flowing, with numerous rapids.
The river flows generally south from the Southern Alps on its journey running through the Skippers Canyon, draining the area between the Richardson Mountains and the Harris Mountains, before flowing into the Kawarau River east of Queenstown.

The Edith Cavell bridge crosses the river at Arthurs Point.

==Tourist operations==

Gold mining featured in its early history and it was one of the richest gold-bearing rivers in the world. Beginning in 1862 when gold was first discovered on the river at Arthurs Point, the river has been panned, cradled, sluiced and dredged. Today small-time gold seekers still work the river and two of its tributaries, Moke and Moonlight Creeks, for gold. It is now a popular river for tourism.

The river is used for commercial white water rafting trips and jet boating rides which operate out of the nearby tourist resort of Queenstown. There is also a canyon swing site on the river a short distance upriver from Arthurs Point. Three jet boat operators have rights to use the river, as do two rafting companies. Much of the land that surrounds the Shotover River, upstream from Arthurs Point, is now foreign-owned by Robert Lange, the former husband of singer Shania Twain.

==Naming==
The river was named Shotover by the first European, William Gilbert Rees to settle on the shores of Lake Wakatipu in 1860. He named it after his business partner, George Gammie&#x27;s English estate, Shotover Park. The river had been previously called &quot;Tummel&quot; by two Scottish pioneers named Donald Angus Cameron and Angus Alphonse Macdonald who had passed through the area before Rees arrived. It was also referred to as the &quot;Overshot&quot; by the early goldminers, but it was the name &quot;Shotover&quot; that stuck,
The Māori name for the river is Kimi-ākau which means &quot;looking for the coast&quot; which is probably a reference to the area as a route to the West Coast in search of Pounamu.

== Old lower Shotover bridge ==

The old lower Shotover bridge was built in 1915 and replaced the previous bridge. It, in turn was replaced in 1975 by a new bridge and was used after then as a support for a pipeline. In 2004, the bridge was restored and now forms part of the Queenstown trail. The bridge is 172.5 metres long and built with tall concrete piers.

==Oxenbridge tunnel==
The &quot;Oxenbridge Tunnel&quot; at Arthurs Point is a tunnel that was part of a failed mining scheme by the Oxenbridge brothers, attempting to divert water from the river to recover gold from the riverbed. It was registered as a Category II Historic Place in 1985, and is used by rafters and kayakers.
There is a Department of Conservation track called the &quot;Oxenbridge Tunnel Track&quot; that goes from the Edith Cavell Bridge alongside the Shotover River to a place near the Oxenbridge Tunnel.

==Freezing==
In July 1991 and June 1992 the river froze from bank-to-bank, near Skippers Canyon, and car-tyre sized blocks of ice disrupted tourist activities in July 2007.

Also in 2012 large parts of the river froze after a series of cold days which also affected commercial operators.

<text>Niccolò Piccinino (1386 – 15 October 1444) was an Italian condottiero. He began his career in the mercenary company of Braccio da Montone, reaching the rank of commander of the company after Braccios death in 1424. He spent most of his career as a soldier of fortune in the service of The Duchy of Milan, fighting on their behalf in the Wars in Lombardy.

==Biography==
He was born in Perugia, the son of a butcher. Piccinino was introduced in the guild of Perugia&#x27;s butchers. He was later scornfully called &quot;son of a butcher&quot; by Pope Pius II. However, Piccinino&#x27;s family actually owned a house with a nearby butchery, and were part of the landed middle class, and, according to tradition, one of his uncles had been &quot;podestà&quot; of Milan.

He began his military career in the service of Braccio da Montone, who at that time was waging war against Perugia on his own account, and at the death of his chief, shortly followed by that of the latter&#x27;s son Oddo, Piccinino became leader of Braccio&#x27;s &quot;condotta&quot;. After serving for a short period under the Florentine Republic, he went over to Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan (1425), in whose service together with Niccolò Fortebraccio he fought in the Wars in Lombardy against the league of Pope Eugene IV, Venice and Florence. 

After an outstanding victory over the Venetians at the battle of Delebio (19 November 1432), he defeated the papal forces at Castel Bolognese (1434). When another papal army under Francesco Sforza defeated and killed Fortebraccio at Fiordimonte, Piccinino was left in sole command of the Visconti army, and in a series of campaigns against Sforza, he seized a number of cities in Romagna by treachery.

In 1438, during the war between Venice and Milan, Piccinino, fighting for Milan, tried to take the city of Brescia, but Scaramuccia da Forlì, fighting for Venice, intervened successfully to raise the siege. In 1439 Piccinino again fought in Lombardy with varying success against Sforza, who had now entered the Venetian service.

Piccinino then induced the duke of Milan to send him to Umbria, where he hoped, like so many other &quot;condottieri&quot;, to carve out a dominion for himself. He was defeated by Sforza at the Battle of Anghiari (1440), but although a number of his men were taken prisoner, they were liberated at once, as was usually done in wars waged by soldiers of fortune. Again the war shifted to Lombardy, and Piccinino, having defeated and surrounded Sforza at Martinengo, demanded of the Visconti the lordship of Piacenza as the price of Sforza&#x27;s capture.

The duke by way of reply concluded a truce with Sforza; but the latter, who, while professing to defend the Papal States, had established his own power in the Marche, aroused the fears of the pope and the king of Naples, as well as of the Visconti, who gave the command of their joint forces to Piccinino. Sforza was driven from the Marche but defeated Piccinino at Montelauro, and while the latter was preparing for a desperate effort against Sforza he was suddenly recalled to Milan, his army was beaten in his absence, and he died of grief and of his wounds in 1444.

Short of stature, lame and in weak health, he was brave to the point of foolhardiness, resourceful, and rarely overwhelmed by defeat. He was cruel and treacherous and had no aim beyond his own aggrandizement. Piccinino left two sons, Jacopo and Francesco, both condottieri.

<text>A Galileo thermometer (or Galilean thermometer) is a thermometer made of a sealed glass cylinder containing a clear liquid and several glass vessels of varying density. The individual floats rise or fall in proportion to their respective density and the density of the surrounding liquid as the temperature changes. It is named after Galileo Galilei because he discovered the principle on which this thermometer is based—that the density of a liquid changes in proportion to its temperature.

==History==
Although named after the 16th–17th-century physicist Galileo, the thermometer was not invented by him. (Galileo did invent a thermometer called Galileo&#x27;s air thermometer, more accurately called a thermoscope, in or before 1603.)

The instrument now known as a Galileo thermometer was invented by a group of academics and technicians known as the Accademia del Cimento of Florence, who included Galileo&#x27;s pupil, Torricelli and Torricelli&#x27;s pupil Viviani. Details of the thermometer were published in the &quot;Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell&#x27;Academia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscana e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia&quot; (1666), the academy&#x27;s main publication. The English translation of this work (1684) describes the device (&#x27;The Fifth Thermometer&#x27;) as &#x27;slow and lazy&#x27;, a description that is reflected in an alternative Italian name for the invention, the &quot;termometro lento&quot; (slow thermometer). The outer vessel was filled with &#x27;rectified spirits of wine&#x27; (a concentrated solution of ethanol in water); the weights of the glass bubbles were adjusted by grinding a small amount of glass from the sealed end; and a small air space was left at the top of the main vessel to allow &#x27;for the Liquor to rarefie&#x27; (i.e. expand).

The device now called the Galileo thermometer was revived in the modern era by the Natural History Museum, London, which started selling a version in the 1990s.

==Operation==
In the Galileo thermometer, the small glass bulbs are partly filled with different-colored liquids. The composition of these liquids is mainly water; some contain a tiny percent of alcohol, but that is not important for the functioning of the thermometer; they merely function as fixed weights, with their colors denoting given temperatures. Once the hand-blown bulbs have been sealed, their effective densities are adjusted using the metal tags hanging from beneath them. Any expansion due to the temperature change of the colored liquid and air gap inside the bulbs does not affect the operation of the thermometer, as these materials are sealed inside a glass bulb of approximately fixed size. The clear liquid in which the bulbs are submerged is not water, but some organic compounds (such as ethanol or kerosene) the density of which varies with temperature more than water does. Temperature changes affect the density of the &quot;outer&quot; clear liquid and this causes the bulbs to rise or sink accordingly.

As the temperature rises the bulbs will sink one by one according to their individual density as the clear holding fluid&#x27;s density gradually changes around them. Eventually all the bulbs may be at the base of the tube depending on the temperature of the surroundings and therefore that of the clear holding fluid. As the temperature falls the reverse happens with the bulbs, until they can all be at the top.

The metal tags on each bulb are stamped with a temperature. If a bulb is in the centre of the column, that gives a close approximation of the environment temperature outside the tube. If there are some at the top and some at the base but none in between the average of the lowest bulb at the top and the highest at the base provides that figure.

<doc id="998362" wikidata="Q735036" url="?curid=998362" title="Mohamed Hassanein Heikal">
<text>Mohamed Hassanein Heikal (‎; 23 September 1923 – 17 February 2016) was an Egyptian journalist. For 17 years (1957–1974), he was editor-in-chief of the Cairo newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; and was a commentator on Arab affairs for more than 50 years.

Heikal articulated the thoughts of President Gamal Abdel Nasser earlier in his career. He worked as a ghostwriter for the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and represented the ideology of pan-Arabism. Heikal was a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union. He was appointed minister of information in April 1970 but resigned from government in 1974 over differences with Anwar Sadat.

In September 2003, upon reaching the age of 80, Heikal wrote an article in the monthly magazine &quot;Weghat Nazar&quot; (where he had been writing for some time) that the time had come for an &quot;old warrior&quot; to put down his pen and take to the sidelines. Heikal stressed that his decision to stop writing did not mean he would disappear, but rather take to the sidelines to observe more thoroughly. In the article he also recounted a lot of the events that occurred during his life and formed his experience including his first mission as a reporter in the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, his friendship with Nasser and his relationship with Sadat. In addition he opened his financial records stating the salaries he had received in all his jobs and posts.

In a 2007 audience with British journalist Robert Fisk, Heikal spoke about the situation in Egypt and criticized Egyptian president Mubarak, saying that Mubarak lives in a &quot;world of fantasy&quot; in Sharm al Sheikh. These comments stirred an uproar within Egyptian society, both for and against Heikal. Heikal did not comment on this criticism except later on Al Jazeera, where he said that he stands by what he has said earlier, adding that Mubarak had not entered political life until very late, which means he lacks necessary experience.

==Biography==
Born in Cairo, Egypt, he counted Abdel Nasser among his grandparents. His family were wealthy wheat merchants in the Nile delta. Mohamed the eldest son in his family, which included three other sisters, was trained to manage the business. However he sought a valuable degree course education at the respected American University in Cairo. During the Second World War, the graduate Heikal commenced a career in journalism at the British controlled and funded &quot;Egyptian Gazette&quot;, which he edited from 1943. The newspaper&#x27;s contributors included English writers George Orwell and Lawrence Durrell. Throughout his career he was a literary critic of Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s military regimes, which he perceived as having departed from Nasser&#x27;s original nationalist dream.

But this attitude was most dramatic during wartime. He covered the First Arab-Israeli War on the establishment of the State of Israel. He was also present in Cairo when the Free Officers staged a military &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in 1952. During this period he immediately befriended with Gamal Abdel Nasser, a member of the group. Yet his journalism with &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; as its editor put the regimes under the microscope, gaining a reputation for investigative reporting, and sound authoritative statements. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dubbed him &quot;the voice of Egypt...window on a secretive regime&quot;. Heikal frequently travelled cross-desert borders between countries in the Middle East eagerly reporting on the conflicts. Heikal was an unashamed Pro-Arabist during the post-war era when Nasser dreamed of a Pan-Arab republic across the whole region. Between 1957 and 1974 he was the author of a well-regarded Friday column &quot;Bi-Saraha&quot; which spoke frankly about Nasser&#x27;s policies at home and abroad, whilst also being critical. He became a member of the Arab Socialist Union Party, briefly acting as foreign minister under Nasser. But his mood changed with the Colonel&#x27;s successors, whose lurch to the right shook Cairo&#x27;s post-colonial establishment.

In April 1970 Heikal was appointed minister of information, replacing Mohamed Fayek in the post. After decades of tension and conflict, Sadat&#x27;s decision in the 1970s was momentous: recognition of the Israeli right to occupy Jerusalem, and to the border with Sinai terminating with Port Eilat. The Egyptians and the Israelis agreed to these terms yearning for peace at almost any price. Sadat, a moderate himself, prepared to meet the implacable Cold War enemy for a negotiated settlement. Heikal was among the old Nasserite Cairo elites that opposed any suggestion of a diplomatic &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the hated enemy. In 1974 he was removed from post by Sadat&#x27;s office and jailed for treasonous activity. Sadat&#x27;s assassination was a setback for Arab-Israeli relations, and ushered a period of retrenched reaction to threats posed by military situations to the stability of Egypt, events explored in Heikal&#x27;s book &quot;Autumn of Fury&quot; (1982). President Mubarak was more conscious of security, policing and law and order, imposing crackdowns on protests. Abroad Egypt, he continued Sadat&#x27;s realignment with the West, and particularly American global capitalism that funded the permanence of the Israeli State, Mubarak&#x27;s new political realism prompted Heikal&#x27;s move to a fundamentalist opposition to what he interpreted as a return to colonial &quot;status quo ante&quot;. Joining Al-Jazeera Television in Qatar, Heikal was able to comment on the Gulf War and then ensuing conflicts from a purely Islamic perspective. In 1996 he published an influential publication &quot;Secret Channels&quot; in which he told the chronological story leading up to the culmination of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993 orchestrated by the West to bring an end to decades of war in Palestine. By the end of his period at Al-Jazeera, he attacked Mubarak in his book &quot;Mubarak and His Time&quot; calling him &quot;inept and corrupt&quot;. Nonetheless, the advent of a new extremist dawn with the Muslim Brotherhood forced Heikal to awake to the perils of chaos. The compromise position of a US-educated president and more social freedoms in Egypt made Sisi more acceptable to Heikal&#x27;s nationalistic views. Heikal suffered from kidney disease in his final years, and died aged 92 from renal failure.

==Al Jazeera Lecture Series==

Heikal&#x27;s lecture series on Al Jazeera furnished him with a greater platform in the Arab world, broadcasting every Thursday evening. Here he generally discussed information he acquired during his years as a journalist, historian, and a player in the political arena in Egypt&#x27;s modern history. His lectures gave an overview of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of modern Arab nationalist governments. He also lectured on the rise of the American Empire and the decline of the previous superpowers. His lectures ranged from general overviews to intricate details of scenes he witnessed. In addition he discussed the events leading to the deterioration of Nasser&#x27;s relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the failed assassination attempt.

<text>Richard Kingsmill is an Australian radio announcer and music journalist. He worked for ABC radio station triple j from 1988 until his redundancy in December 2023, and was the station&#x27;s longest-serving presenter. From 2017 he was group music director of triple j, triple j Unearthed, Double J, ABC Country, and ABC Local Radio.

==Early life and education==
Richard Kingsmill studied mass communications at Macquarie University in the early 1980s. After working at community radio stations in Lismore, Kingsmill moved to Sydney to find a job, and did some training at educational radio station 2SER while studying at university. 2SER was run jointly by Macquarie University and the University of Technology Sydney.

==Career==
While at 2SER in 1988, Kingsmill made a four-part series on the Australian music industry called &quot;Money, Not Harmony&quot;.

His career at the ABC started in 1988 as a producer for triple j. He presented on-air for the first time in 1990.

He introduced and hosted the shows &quot;The J Files&quot; (8 years) and the &quot;Australian Music Show&quot; (10 years), and was co-founder of triple j Unearthed in 1995, a fact of which he is very proud, in particular &quot;being able to uncover the likes of Missy Higgins, Grinspoon, G Flip, and Genesis Owusu&quot;.

Kingsmill began hosting triple j&#x27;s new releases show on Sunday evenings, named for the current year, in 1996. This show continues as of 2023 as one of the highest-rating shows.

In 1998, Kingsmill hosted an Australian music-themed program on &quot;Rage&quot;, for Australian Music Week. In 2009, he presented the triple j Hottest 100 of All Time on &quot;Rage&quot; with Zan Rowe.

In 2003, Kingsmill was promoted to the position of music director after the retirement of Arnold Frolows, who had been in the position since the inception of Double Jay (as triple j was then known) in 1975.

From 2004 until 2019, he curated the annual &quot;One Night Stand&quot; live concerts in remote or regional towns.

In 2009, Kingsmill was the initiator and curator of &quot;Before Too Long: Triple J&#x27;s Tribute to Paul Kelly&quot;. The show ran over two nights at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne in November, with various artists performing tracks by Paul Kelly. The concert was recorded for a 3× CD and a 2x DVD of the same name released in February 2010.

In 2011, Kingsmill created &quot;Straight To You: triple j’s Tribute To Nick Cave&quot;.

In January 2012, he took a break for six months to travel overseas, with Nick Findlay stepping in as acting music director.

In 2015, Kingsmill selected the artists for the live concert &quot;Beat The Drum: Celebrating 40 Years of triple j&quot; The soundtrack once again took out an ARIA.

In 2016, he started &quot;The Funhouse&quot; on Double J, which in 2023 celebrated its 350th show and is one of the station&#x27;s most loved programs.

Over the years, he hosted hundreds of interviews with well-known musicians, including David Bowie, Radiohead, Björk, Nick Cave, Daft Punk, Flume, Gotye, Lana Del Rey, and Kendrick Lamar. In 1998, a remarkable interview with Tori Amos went to air live on the J Files.

In 2017, Kingsmill became group music director, coordinating the team of music directors for four stations on the ABC national network: triple j, triple j Unearthed, Double J and ABC Local Radio. He also oversaw music content at ABC Country, and in 2023 another station, triple j&#x27;s Hottest, was added.

In December 2023, he announced his departure from the ABC, having been made redundant as part of a restructuring of the triple j network. During his time at triple j, Kingsmill managed to double the amount of airtime given to Australian artists, from 30 percent to 60 percent. The station&#x27;s audience increased from 980,000 in 2006 to 3 million in 2022.

==Recognition and awards==
*2010: &quot;Before Too Long: Triple J&#x27;s Tribute to Paul Kelly&quot;, winner, Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album in the ARIA Awards
* 2011: &quot;Straight To You: triple j’s Tribute To Nick Cave&quot;, winner, Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album in the ARIA Awards
*May 2012: Voted International Music Director of the year at the Worldwide Radio Summit in Los Angeles
*2014: sections of Kingsmill&#x27;s 1999 radio interview with the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith were used in the 2014 documentary of Elliot&#x27;s life, &quot;Heaven Adores You&quot;
*2015: 2015 ARIA Award, Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album, for &quot;Beat The Drum: Celebrating 40 Years of triple j&quot;
*2015: Named no. 1 in the &quot;Australian Music Industry Directory&quot;&#x27;s list, &quot;Power 50&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
Kingsmill was triple j&#x27;s longest-serving presenter. Ben Eltham wrote in a 2015 article in &quot;Meanjin&quot; that Kingsmill&#x27;s musical preferences (mainly in hip hop, indie rock, and pop music) influenced what was played on triple j, and that he has shaped its identity. Eltham later (2023) wrote of him as a &quot;kingmaker&quot;, who had the power to make a musician&#x27;s career, and artists ignored by him resented this. Eltham commented that this type of power has now passed to platforms such as Spotify and TikTok rather than individuals, playlists are determined by AI, and major labels dominate the industry.

The longevity and present format of the TV program &quot;Rage&quot; was inspired by Kingsmill&#x27;s radio show in which he hosted artists who would talk about music that they liked. An ABC staff member took this idea to management in 1998, after &quot;Rage&quot; had been running without any presenter for three years.

Kingsmill appeared in the 1998 Radiohead documentary &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;.

In 2019, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia published excerpts of Kingsmill&#x27;s 2SER radio series, &quot;Money, Not Harmony&quot;. Archivist Liz Guiffre wrote: &quot;Kingsmill would go on to become an extremely important part of the industry he so carefully documented here&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kingsmill&#x27;s older brother, Mark Kingsmill, was the drummer in the Australian rock band Hoodoo Gurus.

<doc id="998372" wikidata="Q1440968" url="?curid=998372" title="Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola">
<text>Francesco Bussone, often called Count of Carmagnola (c. 1382 – 5 May 1432), was an Italian condottiero.
== Life ==
Bussone was born at Carmagnola, near Turin, in a humble peasant family. He began his military career when twelve years old under Facino Cane, a condottiero then in the service of the Marquess of Montferrat and later Gian Galeazzo Visconti, duke of Milan.

On the death of Cane, the duchy was divided among his captains; but Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s son and heir, Filippo Maria, determined to reconquer it by force of arms. Facino Cane being dead, Visconti applied to Carmagnola, then in his thirtieth year, and gave him command of the army. Carmagnola&#x27;s success was astonishingly rapid: he subdued Bergamo, Brescia, Parma, Genoa, and other cities. Soon the whole duchy was brought once more under Visconti&#x27;s sway. But Filippo Maria, although he rewarded Carmagnola generously, feared that he might become a danger to himself, and instead of giving him further military commands made him governor of Genoa.

Carmagnola felt greatly aggrieved, and failing to obtain a personal interview with the duke, threw up his commission and offered his services to the Venetians (1425). He was well received in Venice, for the republic was beginning to fear the ambitions of the Visconti, and the new doge, Francesco Foscari, was anxious to join the Florentines and go to war with Milan. Carmagnola himself represented the duke&#x27;s forces as much less numerous than they were supposed to be, and said that the moment was an opportune one to attack him. These arguments, combined with the doge&#x27;s warlike temper, prevailed; Carmagnola was made captain-general of St. Mark in 1426, and war was declared.

But while the republic was desirous of rapid and conclusive operations, it was to the interest of Carmagnola, as indeed to all other soldiers of fortune, to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations, and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently, the campaign dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved.
Carmagnola&#x27;s most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time, Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians. The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand. But the Venetians were dangerous masters to trifle with, and when they, at last, lost all patience, the Council of Ten determined to bring him to justice.

Summoned to Venice to discuss future operations on 29 March 1432, he came without suspicion. On his arrival at the ducal palace, he was seized, imprisoned and brought to trial for treason against the republic. Although the doge befriended him he was condemned to death and beheaded on 5 May. A man of ability, his great mistake was that he failed to see that he could not do with a solvent and strong government what he could with bankrupt tyrants without military resources, and that the astute Visconti meant to ruin him for his abandonment.

In 1416, Carmagnola ordered for military reasons the destruction of the Trezzo Bridge, the largest single-arch bridge in the medieval world. His daughter Luchina was married to the condottiero Luigi dal Verme. He met with Giovanni Fontana.

== Culture ==
Alessandro Manzoni made Francesco Bussone the subject of a poetical drama, &quot;Il Conte di Carmagnola&quot; (1820).

An opera &quot;Le Comte de Carmagnola&quot; with a book by Eugène Scribe and music by Ambroise Thomas was produced at the Paris Opéra on 19 April 1841. A soprano showpiece from the opera has been recorded by Elizabeth Vidal on Talent DOM 2910 77.

Carmagnola is a character in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s &quot;Bellarion&quot;, though he is portrayed as swaggering and self-important, and becomes a minor antagonist.

A sculpted porphyry head widely thought to represent Justinian, on the exterior facade of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, has been nicknamed &quot;Carmagnola&quot; following Bussone&#x27;s beheading.

<doc id="998386" wikidata="Q1772745" url="?curid=998386" title="Monte Plata Province">
<text>Monte Plata () is an eastern province of the Dominican Republic, and also the name of its capital city. It was split from San Cristóbal in 1992.

The province is bordered to the north by the Sánchez Ramírez, Duarte and Samaná provinces, to the east by the Hato Mayor and San Pedro de Macorís provinces, to the south the province of Santo Domingo, and to the west by the provinces of San Cristóbal and Monseñor Nouel.

==History==
The territory that the province of Monte Plata occupies today, was part of the Taino chiefdom of Higüey or Icayagua. The establishment of the population that today lives in the northern enclaves of the city of Santo Domingo and that bear the names Monte Plata and Bayaguana are a consequence of the so-called devastations of Ozorio (1605-1606), the Spanish authorities, in 1603 decided by means of a Royal Decree to depopulate the northwest area of the island in order to eliminate the smuggling of cattle, hides and other products that was being produced by that part of the island.

The populations with their belongings from the cities of Monte Cristi, Puerto Plata, Bayajá and Yaguana were transferred to the southeast of the island where two new cities named Monte Plata and Bayaguana were founded, the names of these cities are the result of the fusion of Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata, and Bayajá and Yaguana.

On May 7, 1842, a strong earthquake shook the city of Monte Plata. One day before the proclamation of Dominican independence in 1844, General Matías Moreno announced independence in Monte Plata, while summoning the troops under his command to march towards the city of Santo Domingo.

Monte Plata was also the scene of the Battle of Bermejo, on September 30, 1863. In it the Spanish troops faced against Dominican nationalist. The Spanish left Monte Plata on March 7, 1864; the restorative forces immediately occupied the square. The next day President Salcedo established his headquarters in Monte Plata. On that same date, he appointed Benigno Filomeno Rojas as general in chief of the eastern armies, replacing General Luperón. President Salcedo remained in Monte Plata for 6 days, until March 13.

On April 23, 1868 Buenaventura Báez was proclaimed President of the Republic in Monte Plata. At the end of 1879 the combat of Porquero or Arroyo Porquero between liberals, represented by Ulises Heureaux, and conservatives, loyal to President Cesáreo Guillermo, took place in Monte Plata. It was an action of the utmost importance since, with the triumph of Heureaux, the political dominance of the Cibao over the south was established.

Starting in 1930, the urban aspect of Monte Plata was outlined with the construction of the square, the church, the market and the park, thanks to the management of the priest Emiliano Camarena. Inhabitants of the surrounding sections came to the city on the first Friday of each month to exchange their products.

==Geography==

Monte Plata has an area of 2,615.29 square kilometers, Guanuma is Part of Monte Plata and home of the monkeys, ranking in 5th place in terms of surface area with 5.4% of the national territory. In the western part of the province is the Sierra de Yamasá mountain range. Part of the Los Haitises National Park, with its scenic landscapes, is also located in the northeast of the province. The main rivers in the province are the Ozama and the Yabacao. Other rivers are Comate, Yamasá, Mijo, Sabita and Guanuma.

==Culture==

Patron Festivities The patron saint festivities of Monte Plata are celebrated from January 11 to 22 of each year, in honor of La Virgen de la Altagracia. This festival comes from the middle of the 18th century; previously they were celebrated in honor of San Antonio de Padua, on June 13.

The Bayaguana patrons are the most popular and crowded of the Monte Plata province festivals. The patron saint festivities of San Juan Bautista de Bayaguana are celebrated from June 14 to 23 of each year. To culminate, on June 24 with the celebration of the day of San Juan Bautista, patron of the town.

Regarding livestock, the vaccine is important, both milk and meat are produced in this province.

Despite the fact that the province has outstanding waterfalls, rivers and a strategic location, Monte Plata has not yet been able to develop its eco-tourism potential, only having an economic activity in this area near the Los Haitises National Park and the Bayaguana municipality.

<doc id="998388" wikidata="Q287934" url="?curid=998388" title="Spinello Aretino">
<text>Spinello Aretino (c. 1350 – c. 1410) was an Italian painter from Arezzo, who was active in Tuscany at the end of the 14th and the first decade of the 15th century. His style influenced the development of late 14th- and early 15th-century painting in Tuscany.

==Life==
Spinello Aretino was the son of a Florentine named Luca. His family was active in the goldsmith trade and had taken refuge in Arezzo in 1310 when the rest of the Ghibelline party was exiled from Florence. His actual name was Spinello Di Luca Spinelli, but he was called &#x27;Aretino&#x27; which means &#x27;from Arezzo&#x27;.

In the past it was believed that Spinello was a pupil of Jacopo del Casentino, a follower of Giotto. However, this is no longer accepted by art historians. Spinello&#x27;s style was a sort of link between the school of Giotto and that of Siena. In the early part of his life he worked in Florence as an assistant to his master Jacopo while painting frescoes in the church of the Carmine and in Santa Maria Novella. Between 1360 and 1384 he was occupied in painting many frescoes in and near Arezzo, almost all of which have now perished.

After the sack of Arezzo in 1384 Spinello returned to Florence, and in 1387–1388 with some assistants covered the walls and vault of the sacristy of San Miniato of Florence with a series of frescoes, the chief of which represent scenes from the life of Saint Benedict. These still exist, though in a sadly restored condition; they are very Giotto-like in composition, but have some of the Siena decorative brilliance of color.
In 1391-1392 Spinello was painting six frescoes, which still remain on the south wall of the Pisan Campo Santo, representing miracles of St. Potitus and St. Ephesus. For these he received 270 gold florins. Among his later works the chief are the very fine series of frescoes painted in 1407–1408 on the walls and vault of a chapel in the municipal buildings of Siena; these also have suffered much from repainting, but still are the finest of Spinello&#x27;s existing frescoes. Frescoes in Sala di Balia of the Palazzo Pubblico represent the war of Frederick Barbarossa against the Pope Alexander III. Spinello died in Arezzo about 1410. 

==Work==
Spinello&#x27;s frescoes are all strong and highly decorative works, drawn with much spirit, and are very superior in style to his panel pictures, many of which appear to be mere bottega productions. The academy of Florence possesses a panel of the Madonna and Saints, which is chiefly interesting for its signature &quot;Hoc opus pinxit Spinellus Luce Aritio D.I.A.&quot; (1391). The easel pictures which are to be found in the various galleries of Europe give little or no notion of Spinello&#x27;s power as a painter. One of the highlights of his late career is a cycle of frescos on the life of Pope Alexander III made for the Sala di Balia of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena.There is an important painting by Spinello Aretino in the Cleveland Museum of Art,&quot;Virgin and Christ Child With Angels&quot;.
There is also an important painting by Spinello Aretino in the Chicago Art Institute,&quot;Saint Francis Before The Pope&quot;.There are also paintings by Spinello Aretino in the Hermitage Art Museum in Saint Petersburg,Russia(&quot;Saint Benedict&quot;)(&quot;Saint Pontianus&quot;).There is also a Late Medieval Italian Painting by Spinello Aretino in the RISD Art Museum in Providence,Rhode Island(&quot;Saint Anthony Abbott Enthroned&quot;).

<doc id="998389" wikidata="Q1352533" url="?curid=998389" title="Pedernales Province">
<text>Pedernales (; ) is the southernmost province of the Dominican Republic, including the offshore island of Isla Beata. It was split from Barahona in 1957. Of its 2,074.53 km2, 1,374 km2 belongs to the Jaragua National Park. A third of its population is of Haitian origin, the highest ratio within the country.

The capital of the province, Pedernales, was originally called Juan López, who was a Spanish inhabitant who had settled in the area around the 19th century.

The province was called Pedernales after the river located on the border with Haiti, in which flint is abundant. The indigenous people of the Dominican Republic, the Taíno, used them to make sharp tools, such as axes and arrowheads.

==Geography==
The province of Pedernales is located in the southwest of the Dominican Republic, sharing its borders with the neighboring Haiti. It is located 330 km (kilometers) from Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital. It is part of the region called Enriquillo, and it is the seventh largest province in the country, with 2,042.40 km2 (square kilometers). It borders the province of Independencia to the north, and the province of Barahona to the east.

Pedernales is located in a geomorphological region known as Procurrente de Barahona. The area of Pedernales has some of the most arid lands in the country. It is formed by successive marine terraces. The lowest part of these is on the edge of the coast, less than 100 m s. n. m. (meters above sea level). As one moves away from the sea, the elevations grow to 400 m. Upon entering the north, the ground continues to rise up to the Sierra de Bahoruco. Mount Vincent, with an elevation of about 2046 m, is the highest point of the province.

The territory of Pedernales has several adjacent lands, such as Isla Beata, Isla Los Frailes, Alto Velo Island, and Cayo Piedra Negra making it a strategic place for fishermen. Historically it was considered important, as it served as an orientation for Spanish and French ships during the colonial era that wanted to reach the Western expanse of the island. In addition, its natural conditions allow the nesting of seabirds and other endemic species.

==History==

The Taíno arrived in Hispaniola around the 8th century A.D. They lived from agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering fruits.

At that time, the island was divided into 5 chiefdoms or regions. The Province of Pedernales occupies the territory of what was previously the chiefdom of Jaragua. When the Spanish arrived, Cacique Bohechío was the head of this chiefdom. The inhabitants of this land were characterized by their rebellion, since they were against the oppression that the Spanish subjected them. During the sixteenth century, this land was a refuge for the chief Enriquillo, a Taíno prince, as he was rebelling.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus discovered Beata Island, and considered it a strategic point for ships, due to its geographical location. This attracted several people who later settled on the shores of the island. The Spanish also kept cattle on the island for the new maritime expeditions.
When Hispaniola was divided into a French and a Spanish colony, the Pedernales River was set as a border limit. From 1844, until the signing of the territorial division treaty (1929-1936), there were several incidents and border conflicts in the Enriquillo and Pedernales region. In 1867, the island of Alto Velo was granted to a North American company. Salt extraction was also started in the Beata lagoons.

The settlement of Pedernales began in 1927, during the government of Horacio Vásquez. It was included in the border colonization plan, which aimed to integrate the area with the rest of the country.

Its first administrator was Socrates Nolasco, appointed on April 13, 1927, by Rafael Espaillat, Minister of Agriculture and Immigration (a descendant of Ulises Francisco Espaillat). He was in charge of coordinating the construction of the first town of Pedernales. Pedernales was created on December 16, 1957.

==Economy and population==

The main activity in the province is currently agriculture, producing coffee and beef cattle. Fishing is also an important activity, being one of the provinces with the highest catch of fish and lobsters. Limestone mining in Cabo Rojo is also important.

The number of farms in the province amounts to a total of 1,128, which represents only 0.004% of the total number of farms in the country, though relatively arid Pedernales has some areas where the land can be very fertile, mainly based on irrigation canals. This has allowed the cultivation of products such as cotton, beans, peanuts, bananas, cassava, coffee, bananas, corn, tobacco, coconut, among others.

According to statistical data, Pedernales is the least densely populated province in the Dominican Republic. For 2010, the total population reached 31,587 people: 16,895 men and 14,692 women, with a density of 15.7 inhabitants / km2 (inhabitants per square kilometer). The predominant ethnic groups are 78% mulatto or mestizo, 13% black and 9% white.

Until 1927, before the Rafael Trujillo regime, the area was inhabited almost entirely by Haitians. Together with the founding of the province, the government imposed measures to raise the Dominican population, stop the Haitian migration, and integrate the province more into the rest of the country.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - M.D.) within them:
*Pedernales, head municipality of the province
**José Francisco Peña Gómez (M.D.)
*Oviedo
**Juancho (M.D.)

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

<text>Peravia () is a province in the southern region of the Dominican Republic. Located on the country&#x27;s Caribbean coast which it is in the south, it is divided in 13 units (three municipalities and 10 municipal districts), while Baní is the province&#x27;s capital. Clockwise, Peravia is bordered by other provinces starting with Azua to the west, San José de Ocoa to the north, and San Cristóbal to the east. Before January 1, 2002, it was included in what is the new province called San José de Ocoa, and published statistics and maps generally relate it to the old, larger, Peravia.

It is named after the Peravia Valley. Along the Azua Province, Peravia is characterized by its dry climate and its dunes that surround the coast. One popular attraction is the Salinas beach, which recently has grown to be a popular tourist destination with a developed town that has shops and hotels.

== Municipalities and municipal districts ==

The province as of June 20, 2006, is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

*Baní
**Catalina (D.M.)
**El Carretón (D.M.)
**El Limonal (D.M.)
**Paya (D.M.)
**Villa Fundación (D.M.)
*Matanzas
**Sabana Buey (D.M.)
**Villa Sombrero (D.M.)
*Nizao
**Pizarrete (D.M.)
**Santana (D.M.)

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

==Geography==
Peravia province has an area of 792.33 km2 (305.92 sq mi). It is located in the southern region, it borders the San José de Ocoa province to the north, to the east it borders San Cristóbal, to the west the province of Azua and to the south it has coasts on the Caribbean Sea. The most important rivers that cross the province are the Nizao, the Ocoa and the Baní.

The province is made up of two main regions, the Central Mountain Range and the Coastal Plain of the Caribbean. The Central Mountain Range, known in the region as the Sierra de Ocoa, extends to the north and west of the province, where the hills of La Barbacoa are located at 1,743 meters above sea level, Valdesia with 1,723 meters above sea level, Firme Rodríguez, Los Guayuyos and Los Naranjos, El Manaclar with 1,400 meters above sea level, where most of the repeaters of the country&#x27;s telephone companies are located and the surveillance radar of the south of the country.

La Barbacoa was declared a Scientific Reserve for the conservation of hydro-graphic basins and sources of streams and source aquifers such as the Rio Nizao. In the south of the province, in Las Calderas Bay, is the Los Corbanitos beach, Las Dunas, Salinas de Puerto Hermoso beach and the Las Caldera Naval Base of the Dominican Navy. About 80% of the Province is dominated by a dry forest, especially in its southern zone, in the north there are different types of humid forests.

==Economy==

The province has a diverse agricultural industry, producing vegetables (tomato, onion, etc.), fruit trees, coffee, onion, coconut, mango, lechoza, cashew, pigeon pea, rice and bananas. Beef farming of cattle and goats is also an important source of income, as well as fishing in the southern Caribbean coast.

Salt production in Las Salinas is produced on terraces through the evaporation of sea water, it is currently under the ownership of the Municipal Council of Baní. Currently a source of employment in the Province is the Punta Catalina Thermoelectric Power Plant.

<doc id="998409" wikidata="Q3052119" url="?curid=998409" title="Embryonic (album)">
<text>Embryonic is the 12th studio album by experimental rock band the Flaming Lips released on October 13, 2009, on Warner Bros. The band&#x27;s first double album, it was released to generally positive reviews and became their most successful album in the US, peaking at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Production==
News of the album first surfaced in an interview with Wayne Coyne, who stated that &quot;Somewhere along the way it occurred to me that we should do a double album... Just this idea that you can weave a couple of themes into there and you can sprawl a little bit.

Several other artists made contributions to various tracks on the album. German mathematician Dr. Thorsten Wörmann contributed to the track &quot;Gemini Syringes&quot;, psychedelic rock band MGMT contributed to the song &quot;Worm Mountain&quot;, and Karen O (lead singer of the alternative rock trio Yeah Yeah Yeahs) contributed to the songs &quot;I Can Be a Frog&quot; and &quot;Watching the Planets&quot;. Karen O&#x27;s contributions were recorded by Wayne Coyne over the phone.

==Background and promotion==
On August 13, 2009, the song &quot;See the Leaves&quot; was reviewed and streamed on Pitchfork.com On September 3, 2009, the album was previewed in its entirety on The Fly website, using Wayne Coyne&#x27;s own track-by-track guide.

On September 17, 2009, the band appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and announced that the album would stream in its entirety on Colbertnation.com until September 21, 2009.

&quot;Embryonic&quot; was streamed in full on the UK music site Clash Music on October 5, just over a week ahead of its release. It was selected as fourth best album of 2009 by Pitchfork Media.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Embryonic&quot; received acclaim from critics upon release, garnering an 81/100 score (indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;) on Metacritic based on 33 critics. &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;ten years after their last masterpiece, The Flaming Lips have finally produced another one,&quot; while &quot;Paste&quot; described the record as &quot;a wonderfully weird parade of sonic delights: an arresting consummation of the Lips&#x27; two-and-a-half decade career.&quot; Other critics praised the album but were also quick to note its dramatically different sound in comparison to previous releases. &quot;Mojo&quot; remarked that &quot;(&quot;Embryonic&quot;″s) themes may be familiar, but its fine, dazzlingly outlandish music is fresh and utterly fearless.&quot; Graeme Thomson in &quot;The Observer&quot; described the album as a &quot;fragmented, loose, indulgent, occasionally inspired, [and] considerably heavier than their last outing&quot;. Stuart Berman in Pitchfork called it a &quot; an unrelentingly paranoid, static-soaked acid-rock epic&quot; and praised the raw directness of the material. David Machese in Spin Magazine also noted the uncompromising sound and lyrical content, describing it as &quot;the band&#x27;s coldest, darkest, slipperiest, least organic work yet.

As of 2011, the album has sold 103,000 copies in the United States.

==Sound and influence==
The style of the tracks on &quot;Embryonic&quot; differs from the styles of previous albums, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; and &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;, and has been reported to be similar to the style of Joy Division, Miles Davis, and John Lennon.

Wayne Coyne says the new record solves their perpetual &quot;dilemma&quot; of what to include on each album, by dumping all their ideas on the follow-up to 2006&#x27;s &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;. Coyne had this to say about the double-LP decision to &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;Some of my favorite records – thinking Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; and even some of the longer things that The Clash have done – part of the reason I like them is that they&#x27;re not focused. They&#x27;re kind of like a free-for-all and go everywhere. It&#x27;s not necessarily because we&#x27;re prolific, I think we always stay in a sort of perpetual panic of like we never have more songs than we need and we always wonder if any of them are any good to begin with.&quot; Coyne notes that &quot;Embryonic&quot; is less polished than &quot;Mystics&quot; or 2002&#x27;s &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; and has a &quot;freak-out vibe&quot;. The frontman also notes the influence of Miles Davis&#x27;s group and slow-burn songs like John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;.

==Deluxe edition==
A deluxe version of the album was released on October 13, 2009.

The deluxe edition includes the original 18 tracks (on two discs) as well as a bonus DVD-Audio which features the album in full dynamic range at 24bit/96 kHz audio. A further variant sold exclusively through the band&#x27;s website is packaged in a &quot;fur pack&quot; with an extended booklet which features additional art, lyrics, and band photos. This web-only deluxe edition also comes with a 14-inch by 28-inch lithograph featuring the full album cover.

Until 12 January 2015, SR P1 closed down between 2.30 am and 5.30 am every day, with the &quot;Vågskvalpet&quot; looping tune and an encrypted talking newspaper broadcast for the vision impaired filling the off-air hours. SR P1 began 24-hour transmission on 13 January 2015.

==Programming==
P1, which subtitles itself &quot;The spoken channel&quot; (&quot;Den talade kanalen&quot;), is the principal radio channel in Sweden for news, community programmes, culture, radio drama, debate, science, philosophy, the expression of opinion and international issues. Many of the programmes on P1 are repeated at least once – at a different time of day – during each broadcast week: this is a typical feature of spoken-word channels of this type (compare BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom, Radio National in Australia, NHK Radio 1 in Japan, CBC Radio One in Canada).

==Broadcasting==
SR P1 can be heard in Sweden on FM and DAB, also worldwide via the internet. Part of the P1 schedule is also relayed by the Radio Sweden 1 satellite channel.

The name P1 was originally an abbreviation of &quot;Program 1&quot;. This is however no longer the case and the channel is now formally called just P1 (&quot;pe ett&quot; in Swedish).

<text>Puerto Plata (, &quot;Silver Port&quot;); () is a province in northern Dominican Republic. It is divided into 9 municipalities, 12 municipal districts and its capital is the resort city of the same name. Neighboring provinces clockwise: Monte Cristi to the southwest, Valverde and Santiago to the south and Espailat to the east, along with the Septentrional mountain range to the north (which separates it from Laguna Salada), and has a coastline with the Atlantic Ocean. The area has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction since the late 1990s mainly due to its fine beaches. 

Created from the Santiago Province in 1867 as a &quot;maritime district&quot;, it became a province in 1907, when maritime districts were suppressed by a new Dominican constitution.

==History==
In 1493, La Isabela was founded by Christopher Columbus, being the first European town in the Americas. For its part, Puerto Plata was founded by Nicolás de Ovando at the beginning of the Hispanic colonization, around 1502. One of the first inhabitants in the years 1509 of the &quot;Villa de Puerto de Plata&quot; was Gaspar Briceño, a native of Arévalo del Reino from Castilla y León, who arrived on the island as a servant of Juan de Berlanga, treasurer of the Mayor&#x27;s Office of the city of Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola. He held the position of &quot;field bailiff&quot; of the Villa de Santiago that belonged to the Villa de Concepción de la Vega and this corresponded to the Mayor&#x27;s Office of the City of Santo Domingo. His name appears in the &quot;Colón-Solís&quot; trial, where the encomendero of the Villa de Santiago, Francisco de Solís, murdered two naborías Indians. The field bailiff was in charge of capturing the Indians or blacks who escaped from the parcels. It was one of the cities devastated in 1606 and was not repopulated until after 1736. The advent of republican times favored the development of the city, which over time became the main port of Cibao, especially for exporting the regional tobacco.

By Resolution of the National Congress dated July 6, 1847, Puerto Plata was elevated from common to Maritime District. It became a province in the year 1850. In 1879 it was the seat of the government of Gregorio Luperón and served as the internal capital of the Republic.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; – D.M.) within them:

<doc id="998414" wikidata="Q549386" url="?curid=998414" title="Hermanas Mirabal Province">
<text>Hermanas Mirabal (; named after the Mirabal sisters) is a province of the Dominican Republic. It was split from Espaillat Province in 1952 and was originally called Salcedo, the name of its capital city; it is still referred to by this name sometimes.

The province is very fertile and its main agricultural product is plantain.

==Name==
The name change came on November 21, 2007. It commemorates the Mirabal sisters, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country by giving up a privileged life to fight against the powerful Dominican leader, Rafael Trujillo. The Mirabal sisters came from Salcedo and were buried there after they were murdered.

==History==
The colonization process throughout the 16th and 19th centuries and the introduction of the cultivation of coffee and cocoa established the main base of the provincial economy, which came to replace the logging operations and the cattle herd, mainly in the mountainous part.

In its beginning, the province was divided between different provinces. The current provincial capital city of Salcedo belonged to the Espaillat province, while the municipality of Tenares belonged to Duarte, and the municipal district of Villa Tapia belonged to the La Vega. Due to the political instability of the time and the predominance of caudillista interests there were conflicts in the relations between Salcedo and its surrounding provinces, and it was not until April 20, 1907, when the National Congress gave the definitive limits to Salcedo.

The population took a very active participation in the construction of its park, the streets, the church, highways and roads, electrification, as well as in the important railway. The construction of the railway line was of great importance, allowing inter-provincial communication, achieving a market insertion, both nationally and internationally.
Due to the progress achieved in the first half of this century, both in economic and cultural terms, allowed the creation of the Province on August 16, 1952, a Province that includes the Municipalities of Salcedo, Tenares, and the then Municipal District of Villa Tapia.

As can be seen, the Municipality of Salcedo had a preponderant role in the constitution of the Province, it was detached from the Espaillat province; Tenares was detached from the Duarte province and Villa Tapia from the La Vega province. The fact of the constitution in recent times of a province, from the detachment of three others, has generated problems of recognition and provincial integration that are still very much alive in the population.

On November 20, 2007, the anniversary of the murder of the Mirabal Sisters, the law giving the name of the Mirabal Sisters to the Province was promulgated.

==Economy==
The colonization process at the end of the last century and the introduction of the cultivation of coffee and cocoa established the main base of the provincial economy, which came to replace the logging operations and the cattle herd, mainly in the mountainous part.

The flat part retains for a long time its features of large estates exploited with livestock and bananas, features that are still evident today. It is around these crops that the province&#x27;s agro-export bourgeoisie is fostered, which at the same time assumes a role of supplier of inputs and goods to the peasant sector. Given the productive capacity of the soils of Salcedo, climatic and ecological conditions allow it to develop coffee and cocoa crops.

By the 1770s, the development of the production of sugar cane, coffee and cocoa became the support of the Dominican economy. The production of cocoa has a great tradition in the country, this together with the production of sugar were the main activities during the years of colonization, based on slave labor for the Spanish colonial market.

For the seventeenth century (1650), the mercantile production suffered a marked decrease, due, among other things, to the emigration of the colonizers to other Latin American countries, lack of slaves and the complete disappearance of these plantations due to the strong natural catastrophes . By this time, national production was reduced to about 650 thousand pounds per year.

Currently the province&#x27;s economy is essentially agricultural throughout the province, the main products being banana, cassava, cocoa and coffee. In the municipality of Tenares, agriculture continues to be the main economic item, followed by services, remittances, among others. This diversification of its production, as well as social stability have been important elements for Tenares to have emerged as the provincial economic capital from the mid-1980s to the present. According to official data, this municipality reports about 50% of the province&#x27;s total taxes and is the municipality with the largest presence of national and regional financial institutions.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distritos municipales&quot; - D.M.) within them:
*Salcedo
**Jamao Afuera (D.M.)
*Tenares 
**Blanco (D.M.)
*Villa Tapia

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of 2012. Urban populations are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot;, literally &quot;heads&quot;) of municipalities or of municipal districts; Rural populations are those living in the districts (&quot;secciones&quot;, literally &quot;sections&quot;) and neighborhoods (&quot;parajes&quot;, literally &quot;places&quot;) outside of them.

<doc id="998417" wikidata="Q1145487" url="?curid=998417" title="Samaná Province">
<text>Samaná () is a province of the Dominican Republic in the Samaná Peninsula located in the eastern region. Its capital is Santa Bárbara de Samaná, usually known as Samaná. 

The province is on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean in the northeastern part of the Dominican Republic. It is known for the mountains of which it is almost entirely formed. Samaná has numerous beaches.

Samaná was originally larger covering the area of what is now the María Trinidad Sánchez province, before being divided during the Trujillo era.

Samaná was also once known as the Samana Bay Company of Santo Domingo.

==Geography==
The Samaná province is occupied by the Sierra de Samaná mountain range, which reaches many of the coastal areas. The highest mountain in this range (and in the province) is located in the eastern portion and is called La Meseta. Samaná has a tropical rainforest climate, with an annual average temperature of 25.9 degrees Celsius. Annual precipitation in the Sierra de Samaná is greater than 2,000 millimeters. There are numerous rivers and streams throughout the province, including the final part of the Yuna River, which flows into the western end of the Samaná Bay.
==History==
Europeans landed and colonized Samaná on January 12, 1493. The explorer Christopher Columbus arrived in the area during his first trip to the Americas. He described it as “the fairest land on the face of the earth” after landing in the white sands of Bay of Rincón. At that time, Samaná was occupied by the Ciguayo tribe and the first hostile encounter between Europeans and natives occurred. This is considered to be the first instance of violent opposition to the Spanish conquistadors in the Americas, as they were attacked with a barrage of spears and arrows from the native warriors.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Samaná was sparsely populated and isolated from the capital Santo Domingo. The area was still inhabited by some Natives as well as &quot;cimarrones&quot; (escaped slaves), and European settlers who were trying to colonize the region. Among the Europeans, those who most frequented the area were English, Dutch, and the French. From time to time, but not continuously, the Spanish colonial authorities made expeditions to fight the French who were trying to occupy the region.

In 1756, the city of Santa Bárbara de Samaná was officially established, with European families mostly from the Canary Islands of southern Spain, in a place called Carenero Grande. The town was organized as a Parish of the La Vega Party, within the territorial division that the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo had then. Decades later when the area became a French colony, through the Treaty of Basel, the French governor of Jean-Louis Ferrand tried to develop the Samaná region, installing French settlers escaping the slave revolts in Haiti, including the family of Théodore Chassériau. These settlers were dedicated to cutting precious woods for export and growing coffee.
The province is also home to what are known Samaná Americans, the descendants of free black Americans immigrated beginning in 1824. They took advantage of the pro-African immigration policy of then president Jean-Pierre Boyer when Samaná was under Haitian rule. This migration to Santa Bárbara, Samaná began with 34 African-American families. Their culture contrasted with the Hispanic culture of the country as they maintain many elements of 19th century African-American culture—such as their brand of English, food, games, community organizations, English names, manners, music and some recipes that have been preserved as a result of their isolation, which until the 20th century was accessible only by boat. Most are of the African Methodist Episcopal and Wesleyan faith brought to the island by their ancestors.

During the entire First Republic (1844–1861) era, Samaná became the El Seibo Province. The Constitution of 1865 created the Maritime District of Samaná, with a military government, which later became the Province of Samaná by the Constitution of 1907 that stopped recognizing the maritime districts as a territorial category.

The territory of Samaná was originally larger, although the entire peninsula has always belonged to it. When it was created it covered both sides of the Samaná Bay, but then in 1938 Sabana de la Mar became part of the El Seibo province. When the Julia Molina province (currently María Trinidad Sánchez) was created in 1958, most of its territory was taken from Samaná. The last reduction was made in 1959 when Trujillo del Yuna (current Agua Santa del Yuna) was segregated to pass it to the municipality of Villa Riva in the Duarte Province.

==Economy==

Fishing and agriculture have historically been the main source of income in Samana, and it is still the main coconut producer in the country. There is also some small mining activity in the more rugged areas of the province, producing marble. Lately tourism is becoming the main economic activity in the province due to its white sand beaches and clear waters. Samaná is one of the main tourist poles in the country. 

Samaná is also one of the breeding places of the humpback whale, during winter and early spring, humpback whale watching is increasingly becoming an important income-generating activity for the province. Thousands of humpback whales come to the coast off Samaná from January to March.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

*Sánchez
*Samaná
**Arroyo Barril (D.M.)
**El Limón (D.M.)
**Las Galeras (D.M.)
*Las Terrenas

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities with population figures as of an estimate on the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.
==Transportation==

A highway connecting the Samaná peninsula to Santo Domingo opened to the public in 2008. It more than halved the driving time from 4 hours to 1.5 hours as it is a straight , connecting from just east of Santo Domingo (near the SDQ airport) to just west of Sanchez. 

There is a significant tourist development evident throughout the Samaná peninsula, particularly that of large all-inclusive resorts, in anticipation of the increased tourism to follow the road&#x27;s completion. On 6 November 2006 the Samaná El Catey International Airport started operations. Samaná has three airports and one harbor.

<text>Aulus Caecina the son of Aulus Caecina, was a member of a prominent family of Etruscan origin in Ancient Rome, and an Ancient Roman writer.

He took the side of Pompey in the civil wars, and published a violent tirade against Caesar, for which he was banished. He recanted in a work called &quot;Querelae&quot;, and was pardoned in the mid 40s BCE by Caesar following the intercession of his friends, above all, Cicero, who had defended his father in 69 BCE with the speech &quot;Pro Caecina&quot;.

Caecina was regarded as an important authority on the Etruscan system of divination (&quot;Etrusca Disciplina&quot;), which he endeavoured to place on a scientific footing by harmonizing its theories with the doctrines of the Stoics.

Considerable fragments of his work (dealing with lightning) are to be found in Seneca (&quot;Naturales quaestiones&quot;, ii. 31–49). Caecina was on intimate terms with Cicero, who speaks of him as a gifted and eloquent man and was no doubt considerably indebted to him in his own treatise &quot;De Divinatione&quot;. Some of their correspondence is preserved in Cicero&#x27;s letters (&quot;Epistulae ad Familiares&quot; vi. 5–8; see also ix. and xiii. 66).

<text>Aulus Caecina Alienus ( 40 – 79) was a Roman general active during the Year of the Four Emperors.

==Biography==
Caecina was born in Vicetia (modern Vicenza) around 40 A.D. He was &quot;quaestor&quot; of Hispania Baetica (southern Iberia) in 68 A.D. On the death of Nero, he attached himself to Galba, who appointed him to the command of Legio IV Macedonica at Mogontiacum in Germania Superior (Upper Germany). In 68 A.D, as quaestor, his job was to control the public monies of the senatorial province of Baetica. Before the end of 68 AD, Galba was informed that Caecina had diverted funds into his own pocket. After a trial, Galba convicted him for misappropriation of funds. 

Having been prosecuted for embezzling public money, Caecina went over to Vitellius, who sent him across the Swiss plateau with troops from Germania Superior. During this campaign, as recorded by Tacitus, he pillaged Aquae Helveticae after engagements between the Legio XXI Rapax and the Helvetii, and later defeated the Helvetii under Claudius Severus at Bözberg. Vitellius then sent him with a large army into Italy. Caecina crossed the Alps through the Great St. Bernard Pass, but was defeated near Cremona by Suetonius Paulinus, the chief general of Otho. Subsequently, in conjunction with Fabius Valens, Caecina defeated Otho at the decisive First Battle of Bedriacum.

The incapacity of Vitellius tempted Vespasian to take up arms against him. Caecina, who had been entrusted with the repression of the revolt, turned traitor, and tried to persuade his army to go over to Vespasian, but was thrown into chains by the soldiers. After the overthrow of Vitellius, he was released, and taken into favor by the new emperor. In 79 A.D he was implicated, along with Eprius Marcellus, in a conspiracy against Vespasian, and was executed in Rome by order of Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus. It was said that Caecina was planning to overthrow the Flavians by inciting the troops. Titus had discovered a speech written in Caecina’s own hand that he intended to read to the soldiers to execute his plan.

Tacitus described Caecina as a man of handsome presence and boundless ambition, a gifted orator and a great favourite with the soldiers.

<text>Arnold Drakenborch (1 January 168416 January 1748) was a Dutch classical scholar.

==Early life==
Drakenborch was born at Utrecht. Having studied philology under Graevius and Burmann the elder, and law under Cornelius Van Eck, in 1716 he succeeded Burmann in his professorship (conjointly with CA Duker), which he continued to hold until his death. Although he obtained the degree of doctor of laws, and was intended for the legal profession, he decided to concentrate on philological studies.

==Career==
His edition of Livy (1738–1746, and subsequent editions) is the work on which his fame chiefly rests. The preface gives a particular account of all the literary men, who have at different periods commented on the works of Livy. The edition itself is based on that of Gronovius; but Drakenborch made many important alterations on the authority of manuscripts which it is probable Gronovius had never seen.

He also published &quot;Dissertatio de praefectis urbi&quot; (1704; reprinted at Frankfort in 1752 with a life of Drakenborch); &quot;Dissertatio de officio praefectorum praetorio&quot; (1707); and an edition of Silius Italicus (1717).

<text>The Kingdom of Hungary held a noble class of individuals, most of whom owned landed property, from the 11th century until the mid-20th century. Initially, a diverse body of people were described as noblemen, but from the late 12th century only high-ranking royal officials were regarded as noble. Most aristocrats claimed ancestry from chieftains of the period preceding the establishment of the kingdom around 1000; others were descended from western European knights who settled in Hungary. The lower-ranking castle warriors also held landed property and served in the royal army. From the 1170s, most privileged laymen called themselves royal servants to emphasize their direct connection to the monarchs. The Golden Bull of 1222 established their liberties, especially tax exemption and the limitation of military obligations. From the 1220s, royal servants were associated with the nobility and the highest-ranking officials were known as barons of the realm. Only those who owned allodslands free of obligationswere regarded as true noblemen, but other privileged groups of landowners, known as conditional nobles, also existed.

In the 1280s, Simon of Kéza was the first to claim that noblemen held authority in the kingdom. The counties developed into institutions of noble autonomy, and the nobles&#x27; delegates attended the Diets (parliaments). The wealthiest barons built stone castles allowing them to control vast territories, but royal authority was restored in the early 14th century. In 1351, King Louis I introduced an entail system and enacted the principle of &quot;one and the selfsame liberty&quot; of all noblemen, but legal distinctions between true noblemen and conditional nobles prevailed. The most powerful nobles employed lesser noblemen as their (retainers) but this private link did not sever the &#x27; direct subjection to the monarch. According to customary law, only males inherited noble estates, but under the Hungarian royal prerogative of prefection the kings could promote &quot;a daughter to a son&quot;, allowing her to inherit her father&#x27;s lands. Noblewomen who had married a commoner could also claim their inheritancethe daughters&#x27; quarter (that is one-quarter of their father&#x27;s possessions)in land.

Although the &quot;Tripartitum&quot;a frequently cited compilation of customary law published in 1514reinforced the idea that all noblemen were equal, the monarchs granted hereditary titles (mainly baron and count) to powerful aristocrats, and the poorest nobles lost their tax exemption from the mid-16th century. In the early modern period, because of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, Hungary was divided into three parts: Royal Hungary, Transylvania and Ottoman Hungary. The princes of Transylvania supported the noblemen&#x27;s fight against the Habsburg dynasty in Royal Hungary, but prevented the Transylvanian noblemen from challenging their own authority. Ennoblement of whole groups of people was not unusual in the 17th century. Examples include the 10,000 who received nobility as a group in 1605. After the Diet was divided into two chambers in Royal Hungary in 1608, noblemen with a hereditary title had a seat in the upper house, other nobles sent delegates to the lower house.

After the Ottomans&#x27; defeat in the Great Turkish War in the late 17th century, Transylvania and Ottoman Hungary were integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. The Habsburgs confirmed the nobles&#x27; privileges several times, but their attempts to strengthen royal authority regularly brought them into conflicts with the nobility, who represented nearly five percent of the population. Reformist noblemen demanded the abolition of noble privileges from the 1790s, but their program was enacted only during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Most noblemen lost their estates after the emancipation of their serfs, but the aristocrats preserved their distinguished social status. State administration employed thousands of impoverished noblemen in Austria-Hungary. Prominent (mainly Jewish) bankers and industrialists were awarded with nobility, but their social status remained inferior to traditional aristocrats. Noble titles were abolished only in 1947, months after Hungary was proclaimed a republic.

==Origins==

The Magyars (or Hungarians) lived in the Pontic steppes when they first appear in written sources from the mid-9th century. Muslim merchants described them as wealthy nomadic warriors, but they also noticed the Magyars had extensive arable lands. The Magyars crossed the Carpathian Mountains after the Pechenegs invaded their lands in 894 or 895. They settled in the lowlands along the Middle Danube, annihilated Moravia and defeated the Bavarians in the 900s. According to some scholarly theories, at least three Hungarian noble clans were descended from Moravian aristocrats who survived the Magyar conquest. Historians who are convinced that the Vlachs (or Romanians) were already present in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century propose that the Vlach (or chieftains) also endured. Neither of these hypotheses are universally accepted.

Around 950, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus () wrote that the Hungarians were organized into &quot;tribes&quot;, and each had its own &quot;prince&quot;. The tribal leaders most probably bore the title &quot;úr&quot; (now &quot;lord&quot;), as it is suggested by Hungarian terms deriving from this word, such as &quot;ország&quot; (now &quot;realm&quot;) and &quot;uralkodni&quot; (&quot;to rule&quot;). The Emperor noted the Magyars spoke both Hungarian and &quot;the tongue of the Chazars&quot; (a powerful steppe people), showing that at least their leaders were bilingual.

The Magyars lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic life but archaeological research shows that most settlements consisted of small pit-houses and log cabins in the 10th century. Tents in use are only mentioned in 12th-century literary sources. No archeological finds evidence fortresses in the Carpathian Basin in the 10th century, but fortresses were also rare in Western Europe during the same period. A larger log cabinmeasuring which was built on a foundation of stones in Borsod was tentatively identified as the local leader&#x27;s household.

More than a 1,000 graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads and bones of horses show that mounted warriors formed a significant group in the 10th century. The highest-ranking Hungarians were buried either in large cemeteries (where hundreds of their men were buried without weapons around their leader&#x27;s burial place), or in small cemeteries with 25–30 graves. The wealthy warriors&#x27; burial sites yielded richly decorated horse harness, and sabretaches ornamented with precious metal plaques. Rich women&#x27;s graves contained their braid ornaments and rings made of silver or gold and decorated with precious stones. The most widespread decorative motifs which can be regarded as tribal totemsthe griffin, wolf and hindwere rarely applied in Hungarian heraldry in the following centuries. Defeats during the Hungarian invasions of Europe and clashes with the paramount rulers from the Árpád dynasty had decimated the leading families by the end of the 10th century. The , a chronicle written around 1200, claimed that dozens of noble kindred flourishing in the late 12th century had been descended from tribal leaders, but most modern scholars do not regard this list as a reliable source.

==Middle Ages==

===Development===

Stephen I (), who was crowned the first king of Hungary in 1000 or 1001, defeated the last resisting tribal chieftains. Earthen forts were built throughout the kingdom and most of them developed into centers of royal administration. About 30 administrative units, known as counties, were established before 1040; more than 40 new counties were organized during the next centuries. Each county was headed by a royal official, the . The royal court provided further career opportunities. As the historian Martyn Rady noted, the &quot;royal household was the greatest provider of largesse in the kingdom&quot; where the royal family owned more than two thirds of all lands. The palatinethe head of the royal householdwas the highest-ranking royal official.

The kings from the Árpád dynasty appointed their officials from among the members of about 110 aristocratic clans. These aristocrats were descended either from native (that is, Magyar, Kabar, Pecheneg or Slavic) chiefs, or from foreign knights who had migrated to the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. The foreign knights had been trained in the Western European art of war, which contributed to the development of heavy cavalry in Hungary. Their descendants were labelled as newcomers for centuries, but intermarriage between natives and newcomers was not rare, which enabled their integration in two or three generations. The monarchs pursued an expansionist policy from the late 11th century. Ladislaus I () seized Slavoniathe plains between the river Drava and the Dinaric Alpsin the 1090s. His successor, Coloman (), was crowned king of Croatia in 1102. Both realms retained their own customs, and Hungarians rarely received land grants in Croatia. According to customary law, Croatians could not be obliged to cross the river Drava to fight in the royal army at their own expense.

The earliest royal decrees authorized landowners to dispose freely of their private estates, but customary law prescribed that inherited lands could only be transferred with the consent of the owner&#x27;s kinsmen who could potentially inherit them. From the early 12th century, only family lands traceable back to a grant made by Stephen I could be inherited by the deceased owner&#x27;s distant relatives; other estates escheated to the Crown if their owner did not have offspring or brothers. Aristocratic families held their inherited domains in common for generations before the 13th century. Thereafter the division of inherited property became the standard practice. Even families descended from wealthy clans could become impoverished through the regular divisions of their estates.

Medieval documents mention the basic unit of estate organization as or . A was a piece of land (either a whole village or part of it) with well-marked borders. Archaeologist Mária Wolf identifies the small motte forts, built on artificial mounds and protected by a ditch and a palisade that appeared in the 12th century, as the centers of private estates. Most wealthy landowners&#x27; domains consisted of scattered , in several villages. Due to the scarcity of documentary evidence, the size of the private estates cannot be determined. The descendants of Otto Győr, the of Somogy County remained wealthy landowners even after he donated 360 households to the newly established Zselicszentjakab Abbey in 1061. The establishment of monasteries by wealthy individuals was common. Such proprietary monasteries served as burial places for their founders and the founders&#x27; descendants, who were regarded as the co-owners, or from the 13th century, co-patrons, of the monastery. Serfs cultivated part of the , but other plots were hired out in return for in-kind taxes.

The term &quot;noble&quot; was rarely used and poorly defined before the 13th century: it could refer to a courtier, a landowner with judicial powers, or even to a common warrior. The existence of a diverse group of warriors, who were subjected to the monarch, royal officials or prelates is well documented. The castle warriors, who were exempt from taxation, held hereditary landed property around the royal castles. Lightly armored horsemen, known as (or archers), and armed castle folk, mentioned as (or guards), defended the borderlands.

===Golden Bulls===

Official documents from the end of the 12th century only mentioned court dignitaries and as noblemen. This group had adopted most elements of chivalric culture. They regularly named their children after Paris of Troy, Hector, Tristan, Lancelot and other heroes of Western European chivalric romances. The first tournaments were held around the same time.

The regular alienation of royal estates is well-documented from the 1170s. The monarchs granted immunities, exempting the grantee&#x27;s estates from the jurisdiction of the , or even renouncing royal revenues that had been collected there. Béla III () was the first Hungarian monarch to give away a whole county to a nobleman: he granted Modrus in Croatia to Bartholomew of Krk in 1193, stipulating that the grantee was to equip warriors for the royal army. Béla&#x27;s son, Andrew II (), decided to &quot;alter the conditions&quot; of his realm and &quot;distribute castles, counties, lands and other revenues&quot; to his officials, as he narrated in a document in 1217. Instead of granting the estates in fief, with an obligation to render future services, he gave them as allods, in reward for the grantee&#x27;s previous acts. The great officers who were the principal beneficiaries of his grants were mentioned as barons of the realm from the late 1210s.

Donations of such a large scale accelerated the development of a wealthy group of landowners, most descending from a high-ranking kindred. Some wealthy landowners could afford to build stone castles. Closely related aristocrats were distinguished from other lineages through a reference to their (actual or presumed) common ancestor with the words (&quot;from the kindred&quot;). Families descending from the same kindred adopted similar insignia. The author of the fabricated genealogies for them and emphasized that they could never be excluded from &quot;the honor of the realm&quot;, that is from state administration.

The new owners of the transferred royal estates wanted to subjugate the freemen, castle warriors and other privileged groups of people living in or around their domains. The threatened groups wanted to achieve confirmation of their status as royal servants, emphasizing that they were only to serve the king. Béla III issued the first extant royal charter about the grant of this rank to a castle warrior. Andrew II&#x27;s Golden Bull of 1222 enacted royal servants&#x27; privileges. They were exempt from taxation; they were to fight in the royal army without proper compensation only if enemy forces invaded the kingdom; only the monarch or the palatine could judge their cases. According to the Golden Bull, only royal servants who died without a son could freely will their estates, but even in this case, their daughters were entitled to the daughters&#x27; quarter. The final article of the Golden Bull authorized the bishops, barons and other nobles to resist the monarch if he ignored its provisions. Most provisions of the Golden Bull were first confirmed in 1231.

The clear definition of the royal servants&#x27; liberties distinguished them from all other privileged groups, whose military obligations remained theoretically unlimited. From the 1220s, the royal servants were regularly called noblemen and started to develop their own corporate institutions at the county level. In 1232, the royal servants of Zala County asked Andrew II to authorize them &quot;to judge and do justice&quot;, stating that the county had slipped into anarchy. The king granted their request and Bartholomew, Bishop of Veszprém, sued one Ban Oguz for properties before their community.

The first Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241 proved the importance of well-fortified locations and heavily armored cavalry. In the following decades, Béla IV of Hungary () gave away large parcels of the royal demesne, expecting that the new owners would build stone castles there. Béla&#x27;s burdensome castle-building program was unpopular, but achieved his aim: almost 70 castles were built or reconstructed during his reign. More than half of the new or reconstructed castles were in noblemen&#x27;s domains. Most new castles were erected on rocky peaks, mainly along the western and northern borderlands. The spread of stone castles profoundly changed the structure of landholding, because castles could not be maintained without proper income. Lands and villages were legally attached to each castle, and castles were thereafter always transferred and inherited along with these &quot;appurtenances&quot;.

The royal servants were legally identified as nobles in 1267. That year &quot;the nobles of all Hungary, called royal servants&quot; persuaded Béla IV and his son, Stephen V (), to hold an assembly and confirm their collective privileges. Other groups of land-holding warriors could also be called nobles, but they were always distinguished from the true noblemen. They held their estates conditionally, as they were required to provide well-defined services to another lord, hence their groups are now collectively known as conditional nobles. The noble Vlach who had landed property in the Banate of Severin were obliged to fight in the army of the ban (or royal governor). Most warriors known as the &quot;noble sons of servants&quot; were descended from freemen or liberated serfs who received estates from Béla IV in Upper Hungary on the condition that they were to equip jointly a fixed number of knights. The nobles of the Church formed the armed retinue of the wealthiest prelates. The nobles of Turopolje in Slavonia were required to provide food and fodder to high-ranking royal officials. Two privileged groups, the Székelys and Saxons firmly protected their communal liberties, which prevented their leaders from exercising noble privileges in the Székely and Saxon territories in Transylvania. Székelys and Saxons could only enjoy the liberties of noblemen if they held estates outside the lands of the two privileged communities.

Most noble families failed to adopt a strategy to avoid the division of their inherited estates into dwarf-holdings through generations. Daughters could only demand the cash equivalent of the quarter of their father&#x27;s estates, but younger sons rarely remained unmarried. Impoverished noblemen had little chance to receive land grants from the kings, because they were unable to participate in the monarchs&#x27; military campaigns, but commoners who bravely fought in the royal army were regularly ennobled.

===Self-government and oligarchs===

The historian Erik Fügedi noted that &quot;castle bred castle&quot; in the second half of the 13th century: if a landowner erected a fortress, his neighbors would also build one to defend their own estates. Between 1271 and 1320, noblemen or prelates built at least 155 new fortresses. In comparison, only about a dozen castles were erected on the royal demesne. Most castles consisted of a tower, surrounded by a fortified courtyard, but the tower could also be built into the walls. Noblemen who could not erect fortresses were occasionally forced to abandon their inherited estates or seek the protection of more powerful lords, even through renouncing their liberties.

The lords of the castles had to hire a professional staff for the defence of the castle and the management of its appurtenances. They primarily employed nobles who held nearby estates, which gave rise to the development of a new institution, known as . A was a nobleman who entered into the service of a wealthier landowner in exchange for a fixed salary or a portion of revenue, or rarely for the ownership or usufruct (right to enjoyment) of a piece of land. Unlike a conditional noble, a remained an independent landholder, only subject to the monarch.

From the 1270s, the monarchs&#x27; coronation oath included a promise to respect the noblemen&#x27;s liberties. The counties gradually transformed into an institution of the noblemen&#x27;s local autonomy. Noblemen regularly discussed local matters at the counties&#x27; general assemblies. The (the counties&#x27; law courts) became important elements in the administration of justice. They were headed by the or their deputies, but they consisted of four (in Slavonia and Transylvania, two) elected local noblemen, known as judges of the nobles.

Hungary fell into a state of anarchy because of the minority of Ladislaus IV () in the early 1270s. To restore public order, the prelates convoked the barons and the delegates of the noblemen and the nomadic Cumans who had settled in Hungary to a general assembly near Pest in 1277. This first Diet (or parliament) declared the fifteen-year-old monarch to be of age in an attempt to put en end to the anarchy. In the early 1280s, Simon of Kéza associated the Hungarian nation with the nobility in his &quot;Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;, emphasizing that the community of noblemen held real authority.

The barons took advantage of the weakening of royal authority and seized large, contiguous territories. The monarchs could not appoint and dismiss their officials at will anymore. The most powerful baronsknown as oligarchs in modern historiographyappropriated royal prerogatives, combining private lordship with their administrative powers. When Andrew III (), the last male member of the Árpád dynasty, died in 1301, about a dozen lords held sway over most parts of the kingdom.

===Age of the Angevins===

Ladislaus IV&#x27;s great-nephew, Charles I (), who was a scion of the Capetian House of Anjou, restored royal power in the 1310s and 1320s. He seized the oligarchs&#x27; castles mainly by force, which again secured the preponderance of the royal demesne. He refuted the Golden Bull in 1318 and claimed that noblemen had to fight in his army at their own expense. He ignored customary law and regularly &quot;promoted a daughter to a son&quot;, granting her the right to inherit her father&#x27;s estates. The King reorganized the royal household, appointing pages and knights to form his permanent retinue. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first chivalric order in Europe. Charles I was the first Hungarian monarch to grant coats of arms (or rather crests) to his subjects. He based royal administration on honors (or office fiefs), distributing most counties and royal castles among his highest-ranking officials. These &quot;baronies&quot;, as the historian Matteo Villani (d. 1363) recorded it in about 1350, were &quot;neither hereditary nor lifelong&quot;, but Charles rarely dismissed his most trusted barons. Each baron was required to hold his own (or armed retinue), distinguished by his own banner.

In 1351, Charles&#x27;s son and successor, Louis I () confirmed all provisions of the Golden Bull, save the one that authorized childless noblemen to freely will their estates. Instead, he introduced an entail system, prescribing that childless noblemen&#x27;s landed property &quot;should descend to their brothers, cousins and kinsmen&quot;. This new concept of also protected the Crown&#x27;s interests: only kin within the third degree could inherit a nobleman&#x27;s property and noblemen who had only more distant relatives could not dispose of their property without the king&#x27;s consent. Louis I emphasized all noblemen enjoyed &quot;one and the selfsame liberty&quot; in his realms and secured all privileges that nobles owned in Hungary proper to their Slavonian and Transylvanian peers. He rewarded dozens of Vlach with true nobility for military merits. The vast majority of the Upper Hungarian &quot;noble sons of servants&quot; achieved the status of true noblemen without a formal royal act, because the memory of their conditional landholding fell into oblivion. Most of them preferred Slavic names even in the 14th century, showing that they spoke the local Slavic vernacular. Other groups of conditional nobles remained distinguished from true noblemen. They developed their own institutions of self-government, known as seats or districts. Louis decreed that only Catholic noblemen and could hold landed property in the district of Karánsebes (now Caransebeș in Romania) in 1366, but Eastern Orthodox landowners were not forced to convert to Catholicism in other territories of the kingdom. Even the Catholic bishop of Várad (now Oradea in Romania) authorized his Vlach (leaders) to employ Orthodox priests. The king granted the Transylvanian district of Fogaras (around present-day Făgăraș in Romania) to Vladislav I of Wallachia () in fief in 1366. In his new duchy, Vladislav donated estates to Wallachian ; their legal status was similar to the position of the in other regions of Hungary.

Royal charters customarily identified noblemen and landowners from the second half of the 14th century. A man who lived in his own house on his own estates was described as living &quot;in the way of nobles&quot;, in contrast with those who did not own landed property and lived &quot;in the way of peasants&quot;. A verdict of 1346 declared that a noble woman who was given in marriage to a commoner should receive her inheritance &quot;in the form of an estate in order to preserve the nobility of the descendants born of the ignoble marriage&quot;. According to the local customs of certain counties, her husband was also regarded as a noblemana noble by his wife.

The peasants&#x27; legal position had been standardized in almost the entire kingdom by the 1350s. The free peasant tenants were to pay seigneurial taxes, but were rarely obliged to provide labour service. In 1351, the king ordered that the nintha tax payable to the landownerswas to be collected from all tenants, thus preventing landowners from offering lower taxes to persuade tenants to move from other lords&#x27; lands to their estates. In 1328, all landowners were authorized to administer justice on their estates &quot;in all cases except cases of theft, robbery, assault or arson&quot; which remained under the jurisdiction of the . The kings started to grant noblemen the right to execute or mutilate criminals who were captured in their estates. The most influential noblemen&#x27;s estates were also exempted of the jurisdiction of the counties&#x27; law courts.

===Emerging estates===


Royal power quickly declined after Louis I died in 1382. His son-in-law, Sigismund of Luxembourg (), entered into a formal league with the aristocrats who had elected him king in early 1387. Initially, when his position was weak, he gave away more than half of the 150 royal castles to his supporters, although this abated when he strengthened his authority in the early 15th century. His favorites were foreigners, but old Hungarian families also took advantage of his magnanimity. The wealthiest noblemen, known as magnates, built comfortable castles in the countryside which became important centers of social life. These fortified manor houses always contained a hall for representative purposes and a private chapel. Sigismund regularly invited the magnates to the royal council, even if they did not hold higher offices. He founded a new chivalric order, the Order of the Dragon, in 1408 to reward his most loyal supporters.

The expansion of the Ottoman Empire reached the southern frontiers in the 1390s. A large anti-Ottoman crusade ended with a catastrophic defeat near Nicopolis in 1396. Next year, Sigismund held a Diet in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) to strengthen the defence system. He confirmed the Golden Bull, but without the two provisions that limited the noblemen&#x27;s military obligations and established their right to resist the monarchs. The Diet obliged all landowners to equip one archer for every 20 peasant plots on their domains to serve in the royal army. Sigismund granted large estates in Hungary to neighboring Orthodox rulers to secure their alliance. They established Basilite monasteries on their estates.

Sigismund&#x27;s son-in-law, Albert of Habsburg (), was elected king in early 1438, but only after he promised always to make important decisions with the consent of the royal council. After he died in 1439, a civil war broke out between the partisans of his son, Ladislaus the Posthumous (), and the supporters of the child king&#x27;s rival, Vladislaus III of Poland (). Ladislaus the Posthumous was crowned without election with the Holy Crown of Hungary, but the Diet proclaimed the coronation invalid, stating that &quot;the crowning of kings is always dependent on the will of the kingdom&#x27;s inhabitants, in whose consent both the effectiveness and the force of the crown reside&quot;. Vladislaus died fighting the Ottomans during the Crusade of Varna in 1444 and the Diet elected seven captains in chief to administer the kingdom. The talented military commander, John Hunyadi (d. 1456), was elected the sole regent in 1446.

The Diet developed from a consultative body into an important institution of law making in the 1440s. The magnates were always invited to attend it in person. Lesser noblemen were also entitled to attend the Diet, but in most cases they were represented by delegates, who were almost always the magnates&#x27; .

===Birth of titled nobility and the &quot;Tripartitum&quot;===

Hunyadi was the first noble to receive a hereditary title from a Hungarian king, when Ladislaus the Posthumous granted him the Saxon district of Bistritz (now Bistrița in Romania) with the title perpetual count in 1453. Hunyadi&#x27;s son, Matthias Corvinus (), who was elected king in 1458, rewarded further noblemen with the same title. Fügedi states that 16 December 1487 was the &quot;birthday of the estate of magnates in Hungary&quot;, because an armistice signed on this day listed 23 Hungarian &quot;natural barons&quot;, contrasting them with the high officers of state, who were mentioned as &quot;barons of office&quot;. Corvinus&#x27; successor, Vladislaus II (), and Vladislaus&#x27; son, Louis II (), formally began to reward important persons of their government with the hereditary title of baron.

Differences in the nobles&#x27; wealth increased in the second half of the 15th century. About 30 families owned more than a quarter of the territory of the kingdom when Corvinus died in 1490. A further tenth of all lands in the kingdom was in the possession of about 55 wealthy noble families. Other nobles held almost one third of the lands, but this group included 12–13,000 peasant-nobles who owned a single plot (or a part of it) and had no tenants. The Diets regularly compelled the peasant-nobles to pay tax on their plots. Average magnates held about 50 villages, but the regular division of inherited landed property could lead to the impoverishment of aristocratic families. Strategies applied to avoid thisfamily planning and celibacyled to the extinction of most aristocratic families after a few generations.

The Diet ordered the compilation of customary law in 1498. The jurist István Werbőczy (d. 1541) completed the task, presenting a law-book at the Diet in 1514. His &quot;Tripartitum&quot;&quot;The Customary Law of the Renowned Kingdom of Hungary in Three Parts&quot;was never enacted, but it was consulted at the law courts for centuries. It summarized the noblemen&#x27;s fundamental privileges in four points: noblemen were only subject to the monarch&#x27;s authority and could only be arrested in a due legal process; furthermore, they were exempt from all taxes and were entitled to resist the king if he attempted to interfere with their privileges. Werbőczy also implied that Hungary was actually a republic of nobles headed by a monarch, stating that all noblemen &quot;are members of the Holy Crown&quot; of Hungary. Quite anachronistically, he emphasized the idea of all noblemen&#x27;s legal equality, but he had to admit that the high officers of the realm, whom he mentioned as &quot;true barons&quot;, were legally distinguished from other nobles. He also mentioned the existence of a distinct group, who were barons &quot;in name only&quot;, but without specifying their peculiar status.

The &quot;Tripartitum&quot; regarded the kindred as the basic unit of nobility. A noble father exercised almost autocratic authority over his sons, because he could imprison them or offer them as a hostage for himself. His authority ended only if he divided his estates with his sons, but the division could rarely be enforced. The &quot;betrayal of fraternal blood&quot; (that is, a kinsman&#x27;s &quot;deceitful, sly, and fraudulent ... disinheritance&quot;) was a serious crime, which was punished by loss of honor and the confiscation of all property. Although the &quot;Tripartitum&quot; did not explicitly mention it, a nobleman&#x27;s wife was also subject to his authority. She received her dower from her husband at the consummation of their marriage. If her husband died, she inherited his best coach-horses and clothes.

Demand for foodstuffs grew rapidly in Western Europe in the 1490s. The landowners wanted to take advantage of the growing prices. They demanded labour service from their peasant tenants and started to collect the seigneurial taxes in kind. The Diets passed decrees that restricted the peasants&#x27; right to free movement and increased their burdens. The peasants&#x27; grievances unexpectedly culminated in a rebellion in May 1514. The rebels captured manor houses and murdered dozens of noblemen, especially on the Great Hungarian Plain. The voivode of Transylvania, John Zápolya, annihilated their main army at Temesvár on 15 July. György Dózsa and other leaders of the peasant war were tortured and executed, but most rebels received a pardon. The Diet punished the peasantry as a group, condemning them to perpetual servitude and depriving them of the right of free movement. The Diet also enacted the serfs&#x27; obligation to provide one day&#x27;s labour service for their lords each week.

==Early modern and modern times==

===Tripartite Hungary===
The Ottomans annihilated the royal army at the Battle of Mohács. Louis II died fleeing from the battlefield and two claimants, John Zápolya () and Ferdinand of Habsburg (), were elected kings. Ferdinand tried to reunite Hungary after Zápolya died in 1540, but the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent (), intervened and captured Buda in 1541. The sultan allowed Zápolya&#x27;s widow, Isabella Jagiellon (d. 1559), to rule the lands east of the river Tisza on behalf of her infant son, John Sigismund (), in return for a yearly tribute. His decision divided Hungary into three parts: the Ottomans occupied the central territories; John Sigismund&#x27;s eastern Hungarian Kingdom developed into the autonomous Principality of Transylvania; and the Habsburg monarchs preserved the northern and western territories (or Royal Hungary).

Most noblemen fled from the central regions to the unoccupied territories. Peasants who lived along the borders paid taxes both to the Ottomans and their former lords. Commoners were regularly recruited to serve in the royal army or in the magnates&#x27; retinues to replace the noblemen who had perished during fights. The irregular foot-soldiersmainly runaway serfs and dispossessed noblemenbecame important elements of the defence forces. Stephen Bocskai, Prince of Transylvania (), settled 10,000 in seven villages and exempted them from taxation in 1605, which was the &quot;largest collective ennoblement&quot; in the history of Hungary.

In addition to the Székely and Saxon leaders, the noblemen formed one of the three nations (or Estates of the realm) in Transylvania, but they could rarely challenge the princes&#x27; authority. In Royal Hungary, the magnates successfully protected the noble privileges, because their vast domains were almost completely exempt from royal officials&#x27; authority. Their manors were fortified in the &quot;Hungarian manner&quot; (with walls made of earth and timber) in the 1540s. Noblemen in Royal Hungary could also count on the support of the Transylvanian princes against the Habsburg monarchs. Intermarriages among Austrian, Czech and Hungarian aristocrats gave rise to the development of a &quot;supranational aristocracy&quot; in the Habsburg monarchy. Foreign aristocrats regularly received Hungarian citizenship, and Hungarian noblemen were often naturalized in the Habsburgs&#x27; other realms. The Habsburg kings rewarded the most powerful magnates with hereditary titles such as baron from the 1530s.

The aristocrats supported the spread of the Reformation. Most noblemen adhered to Lutheranism in the western regions of Royal Hungary, but Calvinism was the dominant religion in Transylvania and other regions. John Sigismund promoted Unitarian views, but most Unitarian noblemen perished in battles in the early 1600s. The Habsburgs remained staunch supporters of the Catholic Counter-Reformation and the most prominent aristocratic families converted to Catholicism in Royal Hungary in the 1630s. The Calvinist princes of Transylvania supported their co-religionists. Gabriel Bethlen granted nobility to all Calvinist pastors.

The kings and the Transylvanian princes regularly ennobled commoners, but often without granting landed property to them. Jurisprudence maintained that only those who owned land cultivated by serfs could be regarded as fully fledged noblemen. Armalistsnoblemen who held a charter of ennoblement, but not a single plot of landand peasant-nobles continued to pay taxes, for which they were collectively known as taxed nobility. Nobility could be purchased from the kings who were often in need of funds. Landowners also benefitted from the ennoblement of their serfs, because they could demand a fee for their consent.

The Diet was officially divided into two chambers in Royal Hungary in 1608. All adult male members of the titled noble families had a seat in the Upper House. The lesser noblemen elected two or three delegates at the general assemblies of the counties to represent them in the Lower House. The Croatian and Slavonian magnates also had seats at the Upper House, and the (or Diet) of Croatia and Slavonia sent delegates to the Lower House.

===Liberation and war of independence===


Forces from the Holy Roman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ottomans at Vienna in 1683. The Ottomans were expelled from Buda in 1686. Michael I Apafi, the prince of Transylvania (), acknowledged the suzerainty of Emperor Leopold I, who was also king of Hungary (), in 1687. Grateful for the liberation of Buda, the Diet abolished the noblemen&#x27;s right to resist the monarch for the defense of their liberties. In 1688, the Diet authorized the aristocrats to establish a special trust, known as , with royal consent to prevent the distribution of their landed wealth among their descendants. In accordance with the traditional concept of , inherited estates could not be subject to the trust. Estates in were always held by one person, but he was responsible for the proper boarding of his relatives.

The liberation of central Hungary continued, and the Ottomans were forced to acknowledge the loss of the territory in 1699. Leopold set up a special committee to distribute the lands in the reconquered territories. The descendants of the noblemen who had held estates there before the Ottoman conquest were required to provide documentary evidence to substantiate their claims to the ancestral lands. Even if they could present documents, they were to pay a feea tenth of the value of the claimed propertyas compensation for the costs of the liberation war. Few noblemen could meet the criteria and more than half of the recovered lands were distributed among foreigners. They were naturalized, but most of them never visited Hungary.

The Habsburg administration doubled the amount of the taxes to be collected in Hungary and demanded almost one third of the taxes (1.25 million florins) from the clergy and the nobility. The palatine, Prince Paul Esterházy (d. 1713), convinced the monarch to reduce the noblemen&#x27;s tax burden to 0.25 million florins, but the difference was to be paid by the peasantry. Leopold did not trust the Hungarians, because a group of magnates had conspired against him in the 1670s. Mercenaries replaced the Hungarian garrisons, and they frequently plundered the countryside. The monarch also supported Cardinal Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch&#x27;s attempts to restrict the Protestants&#x27; rights. Tens of thousands of Catholic Germans and Orthodox Serbs were settled in the reconquered territories.

The outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1715) provided an opportunity for the discontented Hungarians to rise against Leopold. They regarded one of the wealthiest aristocrats, Prince Francis II Rákóczi (d. 1735), as their leader. Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence lasted from 1703 to 1711. Although the rebels were forced to yield, the Treaty of Szatmár granted a general amnesty for them and the new Habsburg monarch, Charles III (), promised to respect the privileges of the Estates of the realm.

===Cooperation and absolutism===

Charles III again confirmed the privileges of the Estates of the &quot;Kingdom of Hungary, and the Parts, Kingdoms and Provinces thereto annexed&quot; in 1723 in return for the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction which established his daughters&#x27; right to succeed him. Montesquieu, who visited Hungary in 1728, regarded the relationship between the king and the Diet as a good example of the separation of powers. The magnates almost monopolized the highest offices, but both the Hungarian Court Chancellerythe supreme body of royal administrationand the Lieutenancy Councilthe most important administrative officealso employed lesser noblemen. In practice, Protestants were excluded from public offices after a royal decree, the , obliged all candidates to take an oath on the Virgin Mary.

The Peace of Szatmár and the Pragmatic Sanction maintained that the Hungarian nation consisted of the privileged groups, independent of their ethnicity, but the first debates along ethnic lines occurred in the early 18th century. The jurist Mihály Bencsik claimed that the burghers of Trencsén (now Trenčín in Slovakia) should not send delegates to the Diet because their ancestors had been forced to yield to the conquering Magyars in the 890s. A priest, Ján B. Magin, wrote a response, arguing that ethnic Slovaks and Hungarians enjoyed the same rights. In Transylvania, a bishop of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Baron Inocențiu Micu-Klein (d. 1768), tried to speak &quot;on behalf of the whole Romanian nation in Transylvania&quot; at the Diet in 1737 but he could not finish the speech because other delegates stated that he could refer only to the Romanians or to the Romanian people for the Romanian Nation did not exist. Five years later, he unsuccessfully demanded the recognition of the Romanians as the fourth Nation on ethnic grounds.

Maria Theresa () succeeded Charles III in 1740, which gave rise to the War of the Austrian Succession. The noble delegates offered their &quot;lives and blood&quot; for their new &quot;king&quot; and the declaration of the general levy of the nobility was crucial at the beginning of the war. Grateful for their support, Maria Theresa strengthened the links between the Hungarian nobility and the monarch. She established the Theresian Academy and the Royal Hungarian Bodyguard for young Hungarian noblemen. Both institutions enabled the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. Freemasonry became popular, especially among the magnates, but masonic lodges were also open to untitled noblemen and professionals.

Cultural differences between the magnates and lesser noblemen grew. The magnates adopted the lifestyle of the imperial aristocracy, moving between their summer palaces in Vienna and their newly built splendid residences in Hungary. Prince Miklós Esterházy (d. 1790) employed the celebrated composer Joseph Haydn. Count János Fekete (d. 1803), a fierce protector of noble privileges, bombarded the French philosopher Voltaire with letters and dilettante poems. Count Miklós Pálffy (d. 1773) proposed to tax the nobles to finance a standing army. Most noblemen were unwilling to renounce their privileges. Lesser noblemen also insisted on their traditional way of life and lived in simple houses, made of timber or packed clay.

Maria Theresa did not hold Diets after 1764. She regulated the relationship of landowners and their serfs in a royal decree in 1767. Her son and successor, Joseph II (), mocked as the &quot;king in hat&quot;, was never crowned, because he wanted to avoid the coronation oath. He introduced reforms which clearly contradicted local customs. He replaced the counties with districts and appointed royal officials to administer them. He also abolished serfdom, securing all peasants the right to free movement after the revolt of Romanian serfs in Transylvania. He ordered the first census in Hungary in 1784. According to its records, the nobility made up about 4.5 percent of the male population in the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (with 155,519 noblemen in Hungary proper, and 42,098 noblemen in Transylvania, Croatia and Slavonia). The nobles&#x27; proportion was significantly higher (six–sixteen percent) in the northeastern and eastern counties, and less (three percent) in Croatia and Slavonia. Poor noblemen, who were mocked as &quot;nobles of the seven plum trees&quot; or &quot;sandal-wearing nobles&quot;, made up almost 90 percent of the nobility. Previous investigations of nobility show that more than half of the noble families received their rank after 1550.

===National awakening===

The few reformist noblemen greeted the news of the French Revolution with enthusiasm. (d. 1795) translated the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; into Latin, and (d. 1795) published its Hungarian translation. To appease the Hungarian nobility, Joseph II revoked almost all his reforms on his deathbed in 1790. His successor, Leopold II (), convoked the Diet and confirmed the liberties of the Estates of the realm, emphasizing Hungary was a &quot;free and independent&quot; realm, governed by its own laws. News about the Jacobin terror in France strengthened royal power. Hajnóczy and other radical (or &quot;Jacobin&quot;) noblemen, who had discussed the possibility of the abolition of all privileges in secret societies, were captured and executed or imprisoned in 1795. The Diets voted in favor of the taxes and the recruits that Leopold&#x27;s successor, Francis (), demanded between 1792 and 1811.

The last general levy of the nobility was declared in 1809, but Napoleon easily defeated the noble troops near Győr. Agricultural bloom encouraged the landowners to borrow money and to buy new estates or to establish mills during the war, but most of them went bankrupt after peace was restored in 1814. The concept of prevented both the creditors from collecting their money and the debtors from selling their estates. Radical nobles played a crucial role in the reform movements of the early 19th century. Gergely Berzeviczy (d. 1822) attributed the backwardness of the local economy to the peasants&#x27; serfdom already around 1800. Ferenc Kazinczy (d. 1831) and János Batsányi (d. 1845) initiated language reform, fearing the disappearance of the Hungarian language. The poet Sándor Petőfi (d. 1849), who was a commoner, ridiculed the conservative noblemen in his poem &quot;The Magyar Noble&quot;, contrasting their anachronistic pride and their idle way of life.

From the 1820s, a new generation of reformist noblemen dominated political life. Count István Széchenyi (d. 1860) demanded the abolition of the serfs&#x27; labour service and the entail system, stating that, &quot;We, well-to-do landowners are the main obstacles to the progress and greater development of our fatherland&quot;. He established clubs in Pressburg and Pest and promoted horse racing, because he wanted to encourage the regular meetings of magnates, lesser noblemen and burghers. Széchenyi&#x27;s friend, Baron Miklós Wesselényi (d. 1850), demanded the creation of a constitutional monarchy and the protection of civil rights. A lesser nobleman, Lajos Kossuth (d. 1894), became the leader of the most radical politicians in the 1840s. He declared that the Diets and the counties were the privileged groups&#x27; institutions, and that only a wider social movement could secure the development of Hungary.

Since the end of the Age of Enlightenment, nationality was more and more associated with the vernacular. Predictions by the German Romantic philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (d. 1803) about the inevitable assimilation of small peoples to a large linguistic group fanned the flames of linguistic nationalism. Although ethnic Hungarians made up only about 38 percent of the population, the official use of the Hungarian language spread from the late 18th century. Kossuth declared that all who wanted to enjoy the liberties of the nation should learn Hungarian. In contrast, the Slovak Ľudovít Štúr (d. 1856) stated that the Hungarian nation consisted of many nationalities and their loyalty could be strengthened by the official use of their languages. Count Janko Drašković (d. 1856) recommended that Croatian should replace Latin as the official language in Croatia and Slavonia.

===Revolution and neo-absolutism===


News of the Revolutions of 1848 reached Pest on 15 March 1848. Young intellectuals proclaimed a radical program, known as the Twelve Points, demanding equal civil rights to all citizens. Count Lajos Batthyány (d. 1849) was appointed the first prime minister of Hungary. The Diet quickly enacted the majority of the Twelve Points, and Ferdinand V () sanctioned them in April.

The April Laws abolished the nobles&#x27; tax-exemption and the , but the magnates&#x27; 31 remained intact. Although the peasant tenants received the ownership of their plots, a compensation was promised to the landowners. Adult men who owned more than of arable lands or urban estates with a value of at least 300 florinsabout one quarter of the adult male populationwere granted the right to vote in the parliamentary elections. The noblemen&#x27;s exclusive franchise in county elections was confirmed, otherwise ethnic minorities could have easily dominated the general assemblies in many counties. Noblemen made up about one quarter of the members of the new parliament, which assembled after the general elections on 5 July.

The Slovak delegates demanded autonomy for all ethnic minorities at their assembly in May. Similar demands were adopted at the Romanian delegates&#x27; meeting. Ferdinand V&#x27;s advisors persuaded the ban (or governor) of Croatia, Baron Josip Jelačić (d. 1859), to invade Hungary proper in September. A new war of independence broke out and the Hungarian parliament dethroned the Habsburg dynasty on 14 April 1849. Nicholas I of Russia () intervened on the legitimist side and Russian troops overpowered the Hungarian army, forcing it to surrender on 13 August.

Hungary, Croatia (and Slavonia) and Transylvania were incorporated as separate realms in the Austrian Empire. The advisors of the young emperor, Franz Joseph (), declared that Hungary had lost its historic rights and the conservative Hungarian aristocrats could not persuade him to restore the old constitution. Noblemen who had remained loyal to the Habsburgs were appointed to high offices, but most new officials came from other provinces of the empire. The vast majority of noblemen opted for a passive resistance: they did not hold offices in state administration and tacitly obstructed the implementation of imperial decrees. An untitled nobleman from Zala County, Ferenc Deák (d. 1876), became their leader around 1854. They tried to preserve an air of superiority, but their vast majority was assimilated to the local peasantry or petty bourgeoisie during the following decades. In contrast to them, the magnates, who retained about one quarter of all lands, could easily raise funds from the developing banking sector to modernize their estates.

===Austria-Hungary===
Deák and his followers knew the great powers did not support the disintegration of the Austrian Empire. Austria&#x27;s defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 accelerated the rapprochement between the king and the Deák Party, which led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Hungary proper and Transylvania were united and the autonomy of Hungary was restored within the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Next year, the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement restored the union of Hungary proper and Croatia, but secured the competence of the Croatian in internal affairs, education and justice.

The Compromise strengthened the position of the traditional political elite. Only about six percent of the population could vote in the general elections. More than half of the prime ministers and one third of the ministers were appointed from among the magnates from 1867 to 1918. Landowners made up the majority of the members of parliament. Half of the seats in municipal assemblies were preserved for the greatest taxpayers. Noblemen also dominated the state administration, because tens of thousands of impoverished nobles took jobs at the ministries, or at the state-owned railways and post offices. They were ardent supporters of Magyarization, denying the use of minority languages. An emigrant aristocrat Baroness Emma Orczy (d. 1947) wrote her novels in English in the United Kingdom. She had left Hungary with her parents when farm workers fearing of losing their job set the Orczy manor on fire at Abádszalók in 1868. Her first novel featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;the first character who could be called a superhero&quot; (Stan Lee)was published in 1905.

Only nobleman who owned an estate of at least were regarded as prosperous, but the number of estates of that size quickly decreased. The magnates took advantage of lesser noblemen&#x27;s bankruptcies and bought new estates during the same period. New were created which enabled the magnates to preserve the entailment of their landed wealth. Aristocrats were regularly appointed to the boards of directors of banks and companies.

Jews were the prime movers of the development of the financial and industrial sectors. Jewish businessmen owned more than half of the companies and more than four-fifths of the banks in 1910. They also bought landed property and had acquired almost one-fifth of the estates of between by 1913. The most prominent Jewish burghers were awarded with nobility and there were 26 aristocratic families and 320 noble families of Jewish origin in 1918. Many of them converted to Christianity, but other nobles did not regard them as their peers.

===Revolutions and counter-revolution===
The First World War brought about the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. The Aster Revolutiona movement of the left-liberal Party of Independence, the Social Democratic Party and the Radical Citizens&#x27; Partypersuaded Charles IV (), to appoint the radical Count Mihály Károlyi (d. 1955), prime minister on 31 October. After the Lower House dissolved itself, Hungary was proclaimed a republic on 16 November. The Hungarian National Council adopted a land reform setting the maximum size of the estates at and ordering the distribution of any excess among the local peasantry. Károlyi, whose inherited domains had been mortgaged to banks, was the first to implement the reform.

The Allied Powers authorized Romania to occupy new territories and ordered the withdrawal of the Royal Hungarian Army almost as far as the Tisza on 26 February 1919. Károlyi resigned and the Hungarian Communist Party leader Béla Kun (d. 1938) announced the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic on 21 March. All estates of over and all private companies employing more than 20 workers were nationalized. The Bolsheviks could not stop the Romanian invasion and their leaders fled from Hungary on 1 August. After a short-lived temporary government, the industrialist István Friedrich (d. 1951) formed a coalition government with the support of the Allied Powers on 6 August. The Bolsheviks&#x27; nationalization program was abolished. The Hungarian Social Democratic Party boycotted the general elections in early 1920. The new one-chamber Diet of Hungary restored the Hungarian monarchy, but without restoring the Habsburgs. Instead, a Calvinist nobleman, Miklós Horthy (d. 1957), was elected regent on 1 March 1920. Hungary had to acknowledge the loss of more than two thirds of its territory and more than 60 percent of its population (including one third of the ethnic Hungarians) in the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June.

Horthy was never crowned king, and therefore could not grant nobility, but he established a new order of merit, the Order of Gallantry. Its members received the hereditary title of (&quot;brave&quot;). They were also granted parcels of land, which renewed the &quot;medieval link between land tenure and service to the crown&quot; (Bryan Cartledge). Two Transylvanian aristocrats, Counts Pál Teleki (d. 1941) and István Bethlen (d. 1946), were the most influential politicians in the interwar period. The events of 1918–19 convinced them that only a &quot;conservative democracy&quot;, dominated by the landed nobility, could secure stability. Most ministers and the majority of the members of the parliament were nobles. A conservative agrarian reformlimited to 8.5 percent of all arable landswas introduced, but almost one third of the lands remained in the possession of about 400 magnate families. The two-chamber parliament was restored in 1926, with an Upper House dominated by the aristocrats, prelates and high-ranking officials.

Antisemitism was a leading ideology in the 1920s and 1930s. A law limited the admission of Jewish students in the universities. Count Fidél Pálffy (d. 1946) was one of the leading figures of the national socialist movements, but most aristocrats disdained the radicalism of &quot;petty officers and housekeepers&quot;. Hungary participated in the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and joined the war against the Soviet Union after the bombing of Kassa in late June. Fearing the defection of Hungary from the war, Nazi Germany occupied the country in Operation Margarethe on 19 March 1944. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and tens of thousands of Romani were transferred to Nazi concentration camps with the local authorities&#x27; assistance. The wealthiest business magnates of Jewish origin were forced to renounce their companies and banks to redeem their own and their relatives&#x27; lives.

===The fall of the Hungarian nobility===


The Soviet Red Army reached the Hungarian borders and took possession of the Great Hungarian Plain by 6 December 1944. Delegates from the region&#x27;s towns and villages established the Provisional National Assembly in Debrecen, which elected a new government on 22 December. Three prominent Anti-Nazi aristocrats had a seat in the assembly. The Provisional National Government soon promised land reform, along with the abolishment of all &quot;anti-democratic&quot; laws. The last German Wehrmacht troops left Hungary on 4 April 1945.

Imre Nagy (d. 1958), the Communist Minister of Agriculture, announced land reform on 17 March 1945. All domains of more than were confiscated and the owners of smaller estates could retain a maximum of land. The land reform, as Cartledge noted, destroyed the nobility and eliminated the &quot;elements of feudalism, which had persisted for longer in Hungary than anywhere else in Europe&quot;. Similar land reforms were introduced in Romania and Czechoslovakia. In both countries, ethnic Hungarian aristocrats were sentenced to death or prison as alleged war criminals. Hungarian aristocrats could retain their estates only in Burgenland (in Austria) after 1945.

Soviet military authorities controlled the general elections and the formation of a coalition government in late 1945. The new parliament declared the Second Hungarian Republic on 1 February 1946. An opinion poll showed that more than 75 percent of men and 66 percent of women were opposed to the use of noble titles in 1946. The parliament adopted an act that abolished all noble ranks and related styles, also banning their use. The new act came into force on 14 February 1947.

==Unofficial nobility==


The Communists took full control of the government between 1947 and 1949, and Hungary was proclaimed a &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; on 20 August 1949. The aristocrats were declared as &quot;class enemies&quot;, and most of them interned to &quot;social camps&quot;actually, forced labour campsto work in the fields in the Great Hungarian Plain. Mass internal deportations occurred in 1950 and 1951. Almost all aristocrats were interned from Budapest to under-populated villages in eastern Hungary, primarily in Hortobágy region within two months in May–July 1951. Figures of a final report shows that 9 dukes, 163 counts, 121 barons and 8 knighted noblemen – altogether 301 aristocrats – and their families were deported from the capital during this period. The deportees were prohibited to leave the boundary of their assigned village and were under constant police surveillance. They were deprived of their belongings, properties and civil rights – they were prohibited to take part in elections. Most of them could work as manual workers in agriculture at state farms on a limited basis, but their deprivation was constant.

Some leftist aristocrats tried to cooperate with the new regime but the Communist leaders did not trust them. As a consequence of the Khrushchev Thaw, those who had been interned were allowed to leave the labour camps, but their former homes were not restored to them. Although Communist historians did their utmost to prove the aristocrats&#x27; preeminent role during the failed anti-Communist Hungarian revolution of 1956, few aristocrats took an active part. Many aristocrats left the country following the suppression of the 1956 revolt. During the 1960s and 1970s, people of aristocratic descent were mainly employed as blue-collar workers, and their children needed a special permit for studying at universities until 1962. Although official discrimination was abolished, former aristocrats were rarely appointed to higher positions. Péter Esterházy (d. 2016) became a celebrated writer during the last decades of the Communist regime.

The Communist one-party system collapsed in the late 1980s, and Hungary was proclaimed a republic in 1989. The first prime minister of the democratic era, József Antall (d. 1993) offered positions in state administration to aristocrats who returned to Hungary, but the aristocracy did not regain its former position. The restitution of former property was an important political issue in most new democracies in the early 1990s. In Hungary, in kind restitution was excluded because many pieces of formerly confiscated property had already been privatized during the last years of the Communist regime. Instead, monetary compensation was made available to the original owners and their descendants but its amount was limited to about US$70,000. In contrast, in kind restitution was the preferred method of restitution in Czechoslovakia, and the original owners could also claim in kind restitution in Romania and Poland. Hungarian aristocrats regained part of their former properties in Romania, and at least one Hungarian noble family also seized property in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia during the restitution process.

The Hungarian act banning the use of noble ranks and styles has not been abolished, and the Constitutional Court of Hungary declared, in 2009 and 2010, that the ban was fully in line with the revised Hungarian Constitution of 1949. In December 2010, two members of the rightist Jobbik Group submitted a draft for the abolition of the ban but they withdrew it in two weeks. On the initiative of the former aristocrat János Nyáry, a private club, the Association of Hungarian Noble Families, was established for people of noble descent in Budapest in 1994. The association became a member of the European Commission of the Nobility in 2007.

<text>John Rudolphus Booth (April 5, 1827 - December 8, 1925) was a Canadian lumber tycoon and railroad baron. He controlled logging rights for large tracts of forest land in central Ontario, and built the Canada Atlantic Railway (from Georgian Bay via Ottawa to Vermont) to extract his logs and to export lumber and grain to the United States and Europe. In 1892, his lumber complex was the largest operation of its kind in the world.

He arrived in Bytown (later renamed Ottawa) at the same time as many other future lumber entrepreneurs such as Henry Bronson, W.G. Perley, John Harris and E.B. Eddy. Even so, by 1890 Booth had overtaken them all to become the largest lumber producer in the world. It was said that at one point the timberlands under his control occupied an area larger than France.

He was familiar with all aspects of his industry, and one observer noted:

==Early life==
J. R. Booth was born on a farm at Lowes near Waterloo (Shefford County) in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, Lower Canada. His parents, John Booth (Ireland, 1802 - Quebec, 1877) and Eleanor Helen Booth (&quot;née&quot; Rowley) (Ireland, 1804 - Quebec, 1834) were Irish immigrants, had a number of children (variously reported as 5, 6 and 8); his paternal grandparents were John Booth and Elizabeth Hill; his patrilineal great-grandfather, Robert Booth who married Eleanor Taylor, was the son of Peter Booth, whose father, James Booth, a Freeman of Dublin, was fourth son of the Rev. Humphrey Booth and wife Letitia Jones. He was related to the Booth Baronets.

John Booth left the family farm at the age of 21 and got a job as a carpenter with the Central Vermont Railroad.
In Kingsey Township, Lower Canada, on January 7, 1853, he married Rosalinda Cooke (Philipsburg, Monteregie Region, Quebec, March 12, 1829 - Ottawa, Ontario, March 24, 1886, buried in Beechwood Cemetery, Ottawa, Ottawa Municipality, Ontario), daughter of Thomas Cooke (1790 - Abbott&#x27;s Corner, Monteregie Region, Quebec, July 15, 1873) and wife Eliza Armstrong (Ireland, July 1808 - Saint-Armand, Monteregie Region, Quebec, March 29, 1871, buried in Abbott&#x27;s Corner Cemetery, Monteregie Region, Quebec), and maternal granddaughter of Robert Armstrong Sr. (Whalton, Northumberland, August 30, 1777 - Franklin, Franklin County, Vermont, January 30, 1850, buried in Abbott&#x27;s Corner Cemetery, Monteregie Region, Quebec) and wife Ann Lattimore Booth (Rennington, Northumberland, April 8, 1786 - Franklin, Franklin County, Vermont, October 21, 1849, buried in Abbott&#x27;s Corner Cemetery, Monteregie Region, Quebec), and moved to the Ottawa River valley. He was involved in the construction of a paper mill in Sherbrooke, and a sawmill in Hull. Upon completion of the latter, its owner, Andrew Leamy hired him to manage the mill for a year. He then ventured out on his own, opening a shingle mill in Hull in a mill that he rented from Alonzo Wright, but within months it was destroyed by fire. He established his own lumber company and won the contract to supply wood for the Parliament buildings at the new Canadian capital of Ottawa, selected by Queen Victoria in 1858. In winning the contract, he underbid more established firms by hiring unemployed longshoremen from Montreal.

== Building a lumber and railway empire ==


===Lumber===

Booth harvested timber from the upper Ottawa River and its tributaries, driving them down the river to his mills, and is known to have started logging in the Amable du Fond River and Lake Nosbonsing area in the late 1860s, arriving at Depot Creek in 1870. Booth expanded his timber limits into the Lake Nipissing watershed in 1881. In order to reach his Ottawa mills, Booth constructed the Nosbonsing &amp; Nipissing Railway (length ) in 1884 to carry sawlogs over the portage from Lake Nipissing to the headwaters of the Mattawa. It was subsequently incorporated as a separate company by Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1886.

Booth&#x27;s vision and boldness were qualities that made him a success. In 1867, he purchased, for $40,000, the timber rights of John Egan&#x27;s of pine on the Madawaska River in what is now Algonquin Park. Five years later, he refused an offer of more than $1 million to sell those rights.

During the latter half of the 19th Century, he amassed timber rights approaching in Central and Northern Ontario which he would harvest for his mills. He often went to his Algonquin timber limits in his own private railway car, working beside his men during the day and on business affairs most of the night, seldom sleeping for more than a few hours. He was always on the lookout for opportunities to reduce costs, and in 1894 he began investing in tugboats in order to accelerate the delivery of log booms to the Chaudière mill.

In 1891, Booth installed 13 band saws at his Ottawa mill, which was said to be more than anywhere else in the world. The next year, that mill produced 140 million board feet (about ) of lumber. It required the supply of 2 million logs annually in order to run at capacity, and some of his timber limits were so remote that it took up to two years for logs to reach the mill. Booth was so dominant in the industry that he assumed the role of price leader, where all competitors met the prices he set for his product. His leading status would continue until 1919, when William Cameron Edwards and others would achieve greater outputs.

Half of the mills&#x27; output was shipped to England; the rest to the United States and throughout Canada. White pine from Booth&#x27;s lumber yards was used to build the decks on the ocean liners of the Cunard Line, including the &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;. In 1905, he constructed a new plant and entered the pulp and paper business, thus being able to use softwood that he had been previously forced to sell. He expanded into the United States through the establishment of docks and a distribution centre at Rouses Point, New York, a planing mill and box factory at Burlington, Vermont, and a sales office in Boston.

The mills&#x27; output was so large that its Fraserfield lumber yard and railyard, acquired in 1870, extended along Bronson Avenue as far south as Carling Avenue, backing onto The Glebe.

The Chaudière Island mills were so extensive that Booth issued tokens for use there, which were in circulation from 1893 until the 1940s.

Fire was a constant threat to his mills, and they burnt down in 1893, 1886, 1900 and 1903. In 1900 alone, 100 million feet of lumber was lost to fire, and Booth also lost his home located at Wellington and Preston Street. The extent of the fire led to a controversial proposal to restrict the amount of lumber being held in the yards, but intensive lobbying by Booth and other lumbermen effectively killed that measure as well as a later one in 1903. Much of Booth&#x27;s personal and business records were lost in these fires. It was also of concern within the timber limits as well, and Booth once said, &quot;If fires are kept out of the forests, there will be more pine in this country 100 years from now than there was fifty years ago, and we shall have lots of timber for the generation to come.&quot;

Booth established a hydroelectric generating station at Chaudière Falls in 1909 in order to power his sawmill and planing mill, after fifty years of using penstocks distributed around his property to directly feed the water turbines that powered his machinery. The construction of the station resulted in the water level of the Ottawa River being raised by , which meant the end of log rafting there.

===Railways===
====Formation of Canada Atlantic====
Booth&#x27;s sawmill operations could never run at full capacity because the output could not be carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. Because of these transportation problems in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant in the development of Canada&#x27;s railway system when he purchased the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M&amp;OJ) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C&amp;PL) in 1879, amalgamating them to form the Canada Atlantic Railway. The M&amp;OJ had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau Landing on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River. The C&amp;PL had received a charter to build a bridge across the St. Lawrence River to Valleyfield, Quebec and then operate a railway across southwestern Quebec to the United States border. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed, and Booth worked to complete the entire route by 1882. The Coteau bridge was completed in 1890, thus eliminating the necessity of transshipping cargo by barge. The CAR formed a subsidiary, the Vermont and Province Line Railroad, which would build a line to Swanton, Vermont on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain in 1897, thus connecting Ottawa to the United States via the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway.

====Expansion to Georgian Bay====
In 1888, Booth chartered the Ottawa, Arnprior and Renfrew Railway to build a line from Ottawa to Renfrew, as well as the Ottawa and Parry Sound Railway to do the same from Parry Sound to Renfrew. In 1891, the two lines (together with the Parry Sound Colonization Railway in 1893) were amalgamated into the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&amp;PS), which ran from Georgian Bay through southern Algonquin Park to Ottawa.

When the PSCR was taken over by Booth, the original intention was to have its terminus at Parry Sound. However, the high prices demanded by local landowners prompted him to choose a location on nearby Parry Island, which would become Depot Harbour. When completed, Depot Harbour became one of the most prominent ports on the Great Lakes, rivalling Collingwood, Midland and Owen Sound. It was the shortest route for shipping grain to the Atlantic, with trains arriving and departing every twenty minutes.

All three lines met &quot;end to end&quot;. The M&amp;OJ met the OA&amp;PS on Booth&#x27;s sawmill property in Ottawa while the C&amp;PL met the M&amp;OJ in Coteau, using several hundred feet of trackage rights of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). In 1899, the OA&amp;PS amalgamated with the CAR. As a result, Booth ruled the largest railway empire built in North America by any one man.

It was said that the first phase of the CAR&#x27;s construction was undertaken without any government assistance, which was unusual at the time. Booth himself was concerned with building the railways as well as marketing the service to build and maintain tonnage on the new lines. He was open to cooperation with other railways in eastern and western Canada, as well as to sale or amalgamation with a larger railway system, and was contemplating such a sale by 1901. Whether it was because Booth at age 74 was tired, or because he realized that competition from other transcontinental lines would soon cause serious problems for the CAR, he did everything possible in the early years of the 20th century to make every aspect of the railway profitable, and therefore attractive to potential buyers.

Booth also operated grain elevators at Depot Harbour, Coteau, Duluth and Milwaukee, and steamships on the Great Lakes, and formed the Canada Atlantic Transit Company, which operated five large lake freighters on the Upper Great Lakes.

====Sale to Grand Trunk====
Prompted by the federal government, the Grand Trunk Railway began negotiating with Booth to acquire the Canada Atlantic as part of the Grand Trunk&#x27;s efforts to expand into northern Ontario and eventually into Western Canada. In August 1904 the GTR agreed to purchase the Canada Atlantic system, including the Great Lakes steamship fleet and the line in Vermont which connected with its Central Vermont Railway subsidiary. The agreed-upon price for the entire system as well as the Depot Harbour and Ottawa terminals was $16,000,000. The Grand Trunk took over all operations of the CAR on 1 October 1905, but the actual purchase was ratified by Parliament only in 1914. Booth was subsequently one of the GTR&#x27;s directors until its nationalization as part of the Canadian National Railways in 1923.

===Other interests===

At the creation of the Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses in 1890 in Ottawa, he was a member of the Provisional Committee. Later in 1892, he became Life Governor of that same Institute by paying at least the amount of $500.
Booth was a significant investor in the Canada Cement Company formed by Max Aitken, which is now part of Lafarge. He was also a director of Foster-Cobalt Mining which took part in the Cobalt silver rush, whose origin took place on one of Booth&#x27;s timber limits.

Together with M.J. O&#x27;Brien, he also invested in The Dominion Nickel-Copper Company (owner of the Murray Mine) in order to create a potential competitor to International Nickel. It was subsequently sold to Frederick Stark Pearson, William Mackenzie and Donald Mann and became the British America Nickel Corporation, in which Booth was a director. In 1921, Booth was induced to vote in favour of a bondholders&#x27; reorganization scheme through the promised issue of $2,000,000 of British American stock. The reorganization was later held by the Ontario courts as not binding on the minority bondholders, and the ruling was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in a decision that has influenced corporate jurisprudence throughout the British Commonwealth. After Inco drove British American into bankruptcy in 1924 by aggressively cutting the price of nickel, it later acquired British American&#x27;s assets.

===Later years===
J. R. Booth continued to run his business empire well into his nineties. Only in 1921 did he convert it from a sole proprietorship into a corporation (known as J.R. Booth Limited). He died in 1925 at the age of 98 after being ill for several months and was survived by his sons Jackson, John Frederick, daughter Helen Gertrude Fleck and several grandchildren and great grandchildren.

In 1943, J.R. Booth Limited, with the exception of its lumber division, was sold to George Weston Limited to become part of the E. B. Eddy Company. The lumber mill was later sold to E. B. Eddy in 1946.
==Other influences==
Booth&#x27;s impact was significant on Ottawa:

:* The right of way used by the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway within Ottawa is now used as the Queensway.
:* Booth Street in Ottawa (which connects to Hull, Quebec via the Chaudière Bridge), together with rue Booth in Gatineau, Quebec and chemin Booth in Kingsmere, Quebec, were named in his honour.
:* J.R. Booth leased a property on Lac Deschênes to the Britannia Bay Boating Club. Designed by Edgar Lewis Horwood, the clubhouse was opened in 1896.
:* J.R. Booth donated the land on the southwest corner of Richmond Road and Britannia Road for the Britannia Heights Methodist Church, which had been meeting in homes since 1869. The Britannia Heights Methodist Church formed in 1873.
:* The acreage he acquired for pasturing the horses for his mills would later become the Dominion Experimental Farm.
:* Booth also had a summer home in Kingsmere, Quebec, on the north shore of Kingsmere Lake.

In Algonquin Provincial Park, Booth Lake is named after him. However, most other traces of Booth&#x27;s interests in the Park (including a summer retreat at the Barclay Estate on Rock Lake) were razed by the Province of Ontario as their leases on crown land ran out.

Two geographic townships have been named after him. In Quebec, Booth Township was surveyed and established in 1908. It is located east of Kipawa, and is part of the unorganized territory of Les Lacs-du-Témiscamingue in the Témiscamingue Regional County Municipality. In Ontario, Booth Township was surveyed and established in 1962. It is located immediately north of Nipigon in Thunder Bay District.

In 1892, Booth rented a cottage at Saranac Lake, New York, where his daughter would cure for several years. Booth brought a pair of skis with him, thus introducing the sport of skiing to the area.

One of Booth&#x27;s descendants noted in 2016 that the manner in which his predecessor had gathered his wealth was exceptional in comparison to &quot;really old-school wealthy families&quot; in Canada, &quot;as most of them came from the booze business, which was illegal. So they didn’t pay taxes; it was all cash. So what J.R. did was that much more impressive.&quot;

==Death, descendants and legacy==
Booth died in Ottawa on December 8, 1925. On his passing, Michael Grattan O&#x27;Leary of the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; noted that what people should remember about him was that he was:

Also at that time, William Lyon Mackenzie King observed:

Booth&#x27;s fortune was a subject of much speculative commentary during the latter years of his life, with estimates ranging up to $100 million. At his death his estate was officially valued at almost $7.7 million; the property was later re-evaluated upwards to $23 million. Although succession duties of $4.28 million were paid in 1927, in 1937 Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn subsequently claimed more and had the Legislative Assembly of Ontario pass the necessary legislation to overcome the legal obstacles. J.R&#x27;s heirs eventually paid another $3 million in 1939.

His son John Frederick Booth, who lived in Canada, married and had a daughter Lois Frances Booth (born Ottawa, Ontario, 2 August 1897; died Copenhagen, 26 February 1941), who was married in Ottawa, Ontario, on 11 February 1924 to Count Erik of Rosenborg, whom she divorced in 1937; they had two children. At the time of the marriage, it was rumoured that Booth contributed half of her $4-million dowry. J.R. issued a formal denial. She later remarried Thorkild Juelsberg, without issue.

<text>Johann Christian Gottlieb Ernesti (1756 in Arnstadt, Thuringia – 5 June 1802 in Kahnsdorf, near Leipzig), was German classical scholar.

From 1774 to 1777 he studied philosophy, philology and theology at the University of Leipzig, where he was a student of his uncle, Johann August Ernesti. In 1782, he was made an associate professor of philosophy at Leipzig; and following the death of his cousin August Wilhelm Ernesti in 1801, was professor of rhetoric for five months. At the university he gave lectures on exegesis of the New Testament and on Greek and Roman writers.

His principal works were:
*Editions of Aesop&#x27;s &quot;Fabulae&quot; (1781).
*Edition of the &quot;Glossae sacrue&quot; of Hesychius (1785).
*Editions of &quot;Suda&quot; and &quot;Favorinus&quot; (1786).
*Edition of Silius Italicus&#x27; &quot;Punica&quot; (1791–1792).
*&quot;Lexicon Technologiae Graecorum rhetoricae&quot; (1795).
*&quot;Lexicon technologiae Latinorum rhetoricae&quot; (1797).
*Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Geist und Kunst&quot; (1799–1802).

# Arrondissement of Strasbourg, (prefecture of the Bas-Rhin department: Strasbourg) with 33 communes. The population of the arrondissement was 514,651 in 2021.

==History==

In 1800 the arrondissements of Strasbourg, Barr, Saverne and Wissembourg were established. In 1806 Sélestat replaced Barr as subprefecture. In 1871 the department was ceded to Germany. In 1919 the department of Bas-Rhin was restored, with the arrondissements of Strasbourg-Ville, Strasbourg-Campagne, Erstein, Haguenau, Molsheim, Saverne, Sélestat and Wissembourg. In 1974 the arrondissements of Erstein and Sélestat were merged into the new arrondissement of Sélestat-Erstein. 

The borders of the arrondissements of Bas-Rhin were modified in January 2015:
* all 56 communes of the former arrondissement of Haguenau to the new arrondissement of Haguenau-Wissembourg
* two communes from the arrondissement of Saverne to the new arrondissement of Haguenau-Wissembourg
* seven communes from the arrondissement of Saverne to the arrondissement of Molsheim
* 18 communes of the former arrondissement of Strasbourg-Campagne to the new arrondissement of Haguenau-Wissembourg
* one commune of the former arrondissement of Strasbourg-Campagne to the arrondissement of Molsheim
* 53 communes of the former arrondissement of Strasbourg-Campagne to the arrondissement of Saverne
* 32 communes of the former arrondissement of Strasbourg-Campagne to the new arrondissement of Strasbourg
* the only commune of the former arrondissement of Strasbourg-Ville to the new arrondissement of Strasbourg
* all 68 communes of the former arrondissement of Wissembourg to the new arrondissement of Haguenau-Wissembourg

<doc id="998446" wikidata="Q1340153" url="?curid=998446" title="Frobenius method">
<text>In mathematics, the method of Frobenius, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, is a way to find an infinite series solution for a linear second-order ordinary differential equation of the form
formula_1
with formula_2 and formula_3.

in the vicinity of the regular singular point formula_4. 

One can divide by formula_5 to obtain a differential equation of the form
formula_6
which will not be solvable with regular power series methods if either or is not analytic at . The Frobenius method enables one to create a power series solution to such a differential equation, provided that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) are themselves analytic at 0 or, being analytic elsewhere, both their limits at 0 exist (and are finite).

== History: Frobenius&#x27; actual contributions ==
Frobenius&#x27; contribution was not so much in all the possible &quot;forms&quot; of the series solutions involved (see below). These forms had all been established earlier, by Fuchs. The &quot;indicial polynomial&quot; (see below) and its role had also been established by Fuchs. 

A first contribution by Frobenius to the theory was to show that - as regards a first, linearly independent solution, which then has the form of an analytical power series multiplied by an arbitrary power &quot;r&quot; of the independent variable (see below) - the coefficients of the generalized power series obey a &quot;recurrence relation&quot;, so that they can always be straightforwardly calculated. 

A second contribution by Frobenius was to show that, in cases in which the roots of the indicial equation differ by an integer, the general &quot;form&quot; of the second linearly independent solution (see below) can be obtained by a procedure which is based on differentiation with respect to the parameter &quot;r&quot;, mentioned above.

A large part of Frobenius&#x27; 1873 publication was devoted to proofs of convergence of all the series involved in the solutions, as well as establishing the radii of convergence of these series.

== Explanation of Frobenius Method: first, linearly independent solution ==

The method of Frobenius is to seek a power series solution of the form
formula_7

Differentiating:
formula_8
formula_9

Substituting the above differentiation into our original ODE:
formula_10

The expression
formula_11
is known as the &quot;indicial polynomial&quot;, which is quadratic in &quot;r&quot;. The general definition of the &quot;indicial polynomial&quot; is the coefficient of the lowest power of &quot;z&quot; in the infinite series. In this case it happens to be that this is the &quot;r&quot;th coefficient but, it is possible for the lowest possible exponent to be &quot;r&quot; − 2, &quot;r&quot; − 1 or, something else depending on the given differential equation. This detail is important to keep in mind. In the process of synchronizing all the series of the differential equation to start at the same index value (which in the above expression is &quot;k&quot; = 1), one can end up with complicated expressions. However, in solving for the indicial roots attention is focused only on the coefficient of the lowest power of &quot;z&quot;.

Using this, the general expression of the coefficient of is
formula_12

These coefficients must be zero, since they should be solutions of the differential equation, so

formula_13

The series solution with above,
formula_14
satisfies
formula_15

If we choose one of the roots to the indicial polynomial for &quot;r&quot; in , we gain a solution to the differential equation. If the difference between the roots is not an integer, we get another, linearly independent solution in the other root.

== Example ==
Let us solve 
formula_16

Divide throughout by &quot;z&quot;2 to give
formula_17
which has the requisite singularity at &quot;z&quot; = 0.

Use the series solution
formula_18

Now, substituting
formula_19

From we get a double root of 1. Using this root, we set the coefficient of to be zero (for it to be a solution), which gives us:
formula_20
hence we have the recurrence relation:
formula_21

Given some initial conditions, we can either solve the recurrence entirely or obtain a solution in power series form.

Since the ratio of coefficients formula_22 is a rational function, the power series can be written as a generalized hypergeometric series.

==&quot;The exceptional cases&quot;: roots separated by an integer==
The previous example involved an indicial polynomial with a repeated root, which gives only one solution to the given differential equation. In general, the Frobenius method gives two independent solutions provided that the indicial equation&#x27;s roots are not separated by an integer (including zero).

If the root is repeated or the roots differ by an integer, then the second solution can be found using:
formula_23
where formula_24 is the first solution (based on the larger root in the case of unequal roots), formula_25 is the smaller root, and the constant and the coefficients formula_26 are to be determined. Once formula_27 is chosen (for example by setting it to 1) then and the formula_26 are determined up to but not including formula_29, which can be set arbitrarily. This then determines the rest of the formula_30 In some cases the constant must be zero. 

Example: consider the following differential equation (Kummer&#x27;s equation with and ):
formula_31
The roots of the indicial equation are −1 and 0. Two independent solutions are formula_32 and formula_33 so we see that the logarithm does not appear in any solution. The solution formula_34 has a power series starting with the power zero. In a power series starting with formula_35 the recurrence relation places no restriction on the coefficient for the term formula_36 which can be set arbitrarily. If it is set to zero then with this differential equation all the other coefficients will be zero and we obtain the solution .

=== Tandem recurrence relations for series coefficients in the exceptional cases ===
In cases in which roots of the indicial polynomial differ by an integer (including zero), the coefficients of all series involved in second linearly independent solutions can be calculated straightforwardly from &quot;tandem recurrence relations&quot;. These tandem relations can be constructed by further developing Frobenius&#x27; original invention of differentiating with respect to the parameter &quot;r&quot;, and using this approach to actually calculate the series coefficients in all cases.

<text>Giovanni Conversini, also known as Giovanni di Conversino or John of Ravenna (Buda, 1343 – Muggia, 27 September 1408), was an Italian educator, whose students included Vittorino da Feltre and Guarino da Verona. He is one of two individuals of that name in Petrarch&#x27;s letters.

A son of Conversanus, he was first heard of on November 17, 1368 as appointed to the professorship of rhetoric at Florence, where he had for some time held the post of notary at the courts of justice. About 1370, he entered the service of the ducal house of Padua, the Carraras, in which he continued at least until 1404, although the whole of that period was not spent in Padua. Between 1375 and 1379, he was a schoolmaster at Belluno, but was dismissed as &quot;too good for his post&quot; and &quot;not adapted for teaching boys&quot;. On March 22, 1382, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at Padua.

During the struggle between the Carraresi and Visconti families, he spent five years at Udine, from 1387 to 1392. Between 1395 and 1404, he was chancellor of Francis of Carrara, and is heard of for the last time in 1406 as living at Venice. His history of the Carraras, a tasteless production in barbarous Latin, says little for his literary capacity; but as a teacher he enjoyed a great reputation, amongst his pupils being Vittorino da Feltre and Guarino da Verona.

<doc id="998456" wikidata="Q139863" url="?curid=998456" title="Chloralkali process">
<text>The chloralkali process (also chlor-alkali and chlor [[Alkali#Alkali salts|alkali]]) is an industrial process for the electrolysis of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions. It is the technology used to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which are commodity chemicals required by industry. Thirty five million tons of chlorine were prepared by this process in 1987. In 2022, this had increased to about 97 million tonnes. The chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced in this process are widely used in the chemical industry.

Usually the process is conducted on a brine (an aqueous solution of concentrated NaCl), in which case sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrogen, and chlorine result. When using calcium chloride or potassium chloride, the products contain calcium or potassium instead of sodium. Related processes are known that use molten NaCl to give chlorine and sodium metal or condensed hydrogen chloride to give hydrogen and chlorine.

The process has a high energy consumption, for example around of electricity per tonne of sodium hydroxide produced. Because the process yields equivalent amounts of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (two moles of sodium hydroxide per mole of chlorine), it is necessary to find a use for these products in the same proportion. For every mole of chlorine produced, one mole of hydrogen is produced. Much of this hydrogen is used to produce hydrochloric acid, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, or is burned for power and/or steam production.

== History ==
The chloralkali process has been in use since the 19th century and is a primary industry in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. It has become the principal source of chlorine during the 20th century. The diaphragm cell process and the mercury cell process have been used for over 100 years but are environmentally unfriendly through their use of asbestos and mercury, respectively. The membrane cell process, which was only developed in the past 60 years, is a superior method with its improved energy efficiency and lack of harmful chemicals.

Although the first formation of chlorine by the electrolysis of brine was attributed to chemist William Cruikshank in 1800, it was 90 years later that the electrolytic method was used successfully on a commercial scale. Industrial scale production began in 1892. In 1833, Faraday formulated the laws that governed the electrolysis of aqueous solutions, and patents were issued to Cook and Watt in 1851 and to Stanley in 1853 for the electrolytic production of chlorine from brine.

==Process systems==
Three production methods are in use. While the mercury cell method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, the use of several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed.

===Membrane cell===
The most common chloralkali process involves the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (a brine) in a membrane cell. A membrane, such as Nafion, Flemion or Aciplex, is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions.

Saturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell. Due to the higher concentration of chloride ions in the brine, the chloride ions are oxidised at the anode, losing electrons to become chlorine gas (A in figure):
:2Cl− → + 2e−

At the cathode, positive hydrogen ions pulled from water molecules are reduced by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing hydroxide ions into the solution (C in figure):
:2 + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−

The ion-permeable ion-exchange membrane at the center of the cell allows only the sodium ions (Na+) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce caustic soda (NaOH) (B in figure): 

Na+ + OH− → NaOH

The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus:
:2NaCl + 2 → + + 2NaOH

===Diaphragm cell===
In the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of asbestos fibers. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the membrane cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.

===Mercury cell===

In the mercury-cell process, also known as the Castner–Kellner process, the &quot;outer&quot; electrolytic cells each contain an anode immersed in brine, which floats on a layer of mercury. The &quot;inner&quot; cells each contain a cathode in a sodium hydroxide solution, floating on the same mercury layer. The walls dividing the cells have gaps below the surface of the mercury layer. This allows mercury to flow between cells, while preventing the aqueous solutions from doing so. 

In the &quot;outer&quot; cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode, producing chlorine gas which bubbles out of the cell. The mercury layer acts as the cathode, here sodium ions in the brine are reduced and form an amalgam with the mercury. Once in the amalgam, sodium atoms are free to move to the &quot;inner&quot; cell.

In the &quot;inner&quot; cell, the mercury layer now acts as the anode. Sodium atoms in the amalgam are oxidized and enter aqueous solution. Meanwhile at the cathode, water is split into hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions.

Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about the high toxicity of mercury and mercury poisoning from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) and Japan (see Minamata disease).

==Unpartitioned cell==
The initial overall reaction produces hydroxide and also hydrogen and chlorine gases:

:2 NaCl + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2 + Cl2

Without a membrane, the OH− ions produced at the cathode are free to diffuse throughout the electrolyte. As the electrolyte becomes more basic due to the production of OH−, less Cl2 emerges from the solution as it begins to disproportionate to form chloride and hypochlorite ions at the anode:

:Cl2 + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O

The more opportunity the Cl2 has to interact with NaOH in the solution, the less Cl2 emerges at the surface of the solution and the faster the production of hypochlorite progresses. This depends on factors such as solution temperature, the amount of time the Cl2 molecule is in contact with the solution, and concentration of NaOH.

Likewise, as hypochlorite increases in concentration, chlorates are produced from them:

: 3 NaClO → NaClO3 + 2 NaCl

This reaction is accelerated at temperatures above about 60 °C. Other reactions occur, such as the self-ionization of water and the decomposition of hypochlorite at the cathode, the rate of the latter depends on factors such as diffusion and the surface area of the cathode in contact with the electrolyte.

If current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will dissolve in unpartitioned cells.

If producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% sodium or potassium chromate to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.

==Electrodes==

Due to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from materials such as platinum metal, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday&#x27;s time), or platinized titanium. A mixed metal oxide clad titanium anode (also called a dimensionally stable anode) is the industrial standard today. Historically, platinum, magnetite, lead dioxide, manganese dioxide, and ferrosilicon (13–15% silicon) have also been used as anodes. Platinum alloyed with iridium is more resistant to corrosion from chlorine than pure platinum. Unclad titanium cannot be used as an anode because it anodizes, forming a non-conductive oxide and passivates. Graphite will slowly disintegrate due to internal electrolytic gas production from the porous nature of the material and carbon dioxide forming due to carbon oxidation, causing fine particles of graphite to be suspended in the electrolyte that can be removed by filtration. The cathode (where hydroxide forms) can be made from unalloyed titanium, graphite, or a more easily oxidized metal such as stainless steel or nickel.

==Manufacturer associations==
The interests of chloralkali product manufacturers are represented at regional, national and international levels by associations such as Euro Chlor and The World Chlorine Council.

<text>Hisar also known as Hissar is the administrative headquarters of Hisar district in the state of Haryana in northwestern India. It is located to the west of New Delhi, India&#x27;s capital, and has been identified as a counter-magnet city for the National Capital Region to develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi. 

The city was ruled by several major powers, including the Mauryans in the third century BC, the Tughlaqs in the 14th century, the Mughals in the 16th century, and the British in the 19th century. After India achieved independence, it was unified with the state of Punjab. When the Punjab was divided in 1966, Hisar became part of Haryana.

The current name was given in 1354 AD, as &quot;Hisar-e-Firoza&quot; by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. The Ghaggar and Drishadvati Rivers once flowed through the city, but they have now changed their course. Hisar has a continental climate, with very hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most commonly spoken languages are Hindi, Haryanvi, and Bagri.

==History==
===Early history===
Archeological excavations at nearby locations of Rakhigarhi (7000 BCE), Siswal (4000 BCE), and Lohari Ragho suggest the presence of human habitation from pre-Harappan period. Later, Aryan people settled around Drsadvati River. The Jain literature Uttaradhayana Sutra ((599/540 - 527/468 BCE) mentions a town Isukara in the Kuru (c. 1200 – c. 900 BCE) country which is believed to be the earlier name of Hisar. The kingdom of Hisar, with its capital at Agroha, possibly assisted Chandragupta Maurya (reign: 321–297 BCE) in his war against the Greeks. The kingdom was then included in the Mauryan Empire, as evidenced by the discovery of Ashokan pillars in the vicinity of the city. The city later came under the Kushan Empire (127 - 375 CE) and the Gupta Empire (250 - 550 CE). The area was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni during his campaigns. In the 12th century, the Chauhan king Prithviraj Chauhan made Hansi, located in the present day Hisar district, his capital and built a fort. It remained a strategic place for Chauhan Empire until Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated in the Second Battle of Tarain by the invading Ghurid ruler Muhammad Ghori.

===Tughlaq era===
Hisar was founded in 1354 AD, as &#x27;Hisar-e-Firoza&#x27; by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. He built a walled fort with four gates, the Delhi Gate and Mori Gate to the east, the Nagori Gate to the south, and the Talaqi Gate to the west. The construction of the fort started in 1354 AD and was completed in 1356 AD. In the middle of the fort stood the Firoz Shah Palace. Apart from its several underground apartments, the complex had different buildings such as Baradari, Lat ki Masjid, Diwan-e-Aam, and Shahi Darwaza. Near the palace was the Gujri Mahal built by the emperor for his wife name Gujri. The city was named as Hisar-e-Firoza, which means Fort of Firoz in Persian. Timur invaded the city in 1398 AD and his soldiers set fire to the fort.

The city later came under the rule of Sayyid dynasty and Lodi dynasty before Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the first battle of Panipat.

=== Mughal era ===
When Babur invaded India in 1524–1526, Hisar was part of Ibrahim Lodi&#x27;s empire. In the battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur sent prince Humayun, who succeeded in defeating the army of Ibrahim Lodi. Babur handed over the city of Hisar to Humayun as a reward for his success on his first military expedition. In 1540, Hisar came under the control of Sher Shah Suri when he defeated Humayun but Humayun took it back in 1555 and assigned it to Akbar. During Akbar&#x27;s reign (1556–1605), Hisar once again became a place of considerable importance. The city remained under the rule of Mughals until 1760.

===British era===
Hisar was occupied by George Thomas, an Irish adventurer, in 1798. The arrangement continued until 1801 when Thomas was driven out by the Sikh-Maratha-French confederacy. The region came under the rule of British East India Company in 1803 and remained a part until the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when Muhammad Azim and Rao Tula Ram conquered it away for a short period. The company sent forces under General Van Cortlandt, who defeated Azim and Tula Ram on 16 November 1857. Between 1803 and 1879, the British constructed a 4,000-km-long Great Hedge of India, for levying the customs duty on salt and sugar, that ran through Hisar and Hansi. Hisar became a municipality in 1867.

For their participation in First War of Independence, the Chaudharys and Lambardars of villages involved in the rebellion were deprived of their land and property. This included 368 people from Hisar and Gurugram who were either hanged or transported for life. The city remained as a major centre of the Indian independence movement from the rebellion of 1857 until the independence, as many national leaders visited the city during the movement such as Lala Lajpat Rai in 1886, Subhas Chandra Bose in 1938, and Jawaharlal Nehru in 1946.

===After independence===
After independence, the city became a part of Punjab and later Haryana in 1966.

==Geography==
Hisar is located at in western Haryana. It has an average elevation of above sea level. The region is part of the alluvial Ghaggar-Yamuna plain and its southern and western portions mark a gradual transition to the desert. The Ghaggar and the Drishadvati rivers once flowed through the city. According to tectonic map, the district lies on Delhi-Lahore Ridge which is bounded by thrusts and no earthquake of any significance has originated in the zone in the past. Only one instance has been recorded of a famine occurring in the city in 1837–38.

==Climate==
Hisar has a semi-arid climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. The main characteristics of climate in Hisar are dryness, extremes of temperature, and scanty rainfall. The maximum daytime temperature during the summer varies between . During winter, its ranges between 1.5 °C and 4 °C. Maximum temperature recorded is in May 2024, whereas the minimum temperature recorded is in January 1929. Annual average maximum and minimum temperature is and , respectively. Relative humidity varies from 5 to 100%.

Hisar is located on the outer margins of the south-west monsoon region. The average annual rainfall is around , most of which occurs during July and August. The annual highest rainfall of was recorded in 1976 and the lowest of in 2000. Dew is observed in December and January. Hot winds, locally known as &quot;loo&quot;, are strong and frequent from May to July. Occasionally, dust storms are experienced during summer and hail storms during February to April. Fog prevails generally in December and January. Thunderstorms also occur during the post-monsoon season and summer.

==Civic administration==
Hisar became a municipality in 1867. It was made the headquarters of the Hisar district in 1832. The Municipal Corporation of Hisar, consisting of 20 wards, is headed by a mayor. Law and order in the city are maintained by Haryana Police, which is headed by Superintendent of Police. The city also serves as headquarters of the Hisar Range of Haryana Police which covers Sirsa, Jind, Bhiwani, and Hisar and is headed by Inspector General of Police. District court was set up at Hisar in 1832 and was upgraded as a Sessions Division in 1915. It is headed by Chief Judicial Magistrate. The district court has a bar association which was founded in 1870.

Hisar elects its member to the legislative assembly for Hisar (Vidhan Sabha constituency) and a member to the parliament for Hisar Lok Sabha constituency. It serves as the headquarters of 33rd Battalion of Border Security Force and 3rd Battalion of Haryana Armed Police. The 33rd Armoured Division of Indian Army is stationed at Hisar and is a part of I Corps. In 1996, Brigade of the Guards arrived here for conversion to mechanized profile and the unit is now a fully mechanized battalion.

==Economy==
The city has a large steel industry and is known as the &#x27;City of Steel&#x27;. As of June 2012, Hisar is India&#x27;s largest manufacturer of galvanized iron. Textile and automobile industry is also a major contributor to the economy of the city. It also has a large number of livestock farms with the Central Livestock Farm, established in 1809 being one of the Asia&#x27;s largest cattle farms. The Jindal Group headed by Savitri Jindal is the world&#x27;s largest producer of stainless steel strips for razor blades and India&#x27;s largest producer of coin blanks. The city has been identified as a counter-magnet city for the National Capital Region to attract migrants and develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census of India, Hisar has a population of 301,249 and is currently the 141st-most populated city in India. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%, with 844 females per thousand males. Hisar has an average literacy rate of 81.04%, higher than the national average: male literacy is 86.13% and female literacy is 75.00%. In Hisar, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age and the child sex ratio is 860 girls per thousand boys. Although Hisar city has population of 301,249, its urban population is 306,893, of which 166,623 are males and 140,270 are females. The decadal growth rate was 27.06%. Historically, Hisar had an estimated population of 7,000 people in 1843. 

=== Religion ===
Over 97% of the city&#x27;s population are followers of Hinduism. The remaining 3% are followers of Sikhism, Jainism, Islam, and Christianity. The city had a major Muslim population before Indian Independence in 1947, following which most Muslims migrated to Pakistan during the Partition of India. It was also a major centre of learning for Digambara Jains and was once the seat of Bhattaraka, head of Digambara Jain institutions.

==Culture==

Most of the popular Indian festivals are celebrated in the city including Diwali, Dussehra, Ram Navami, Janamashtami, Shivratri, Lohri, Gugga Navami, Holi, Basant Panchami, Teej and Makar Sankranti. The festivals of Jains, Christians, Sikhs and Muslims are also celebrated. Sweets are popular, with Hansi ka Peda being the most popular amongst them. Ghoomar is the primary folk dance performed by people during festivals and other occasions and Saang is the folk-theatre of the region. Classical Indian vocalist Jasraj and poet Vishnu Prabhakar belong to Hisar.

===Architecture===
Signs of pre-Harappan settlements have been found at Siswal and Lohari Ragho in Hisar district. One of the four pre-Harappan phases has been named Sothi-Siswal period (3200–2600 BC) on this site. Harappa settlements can be found as well in Rakhigarhi. The site covers 2180 hectares, making it the largest Harappan site known in India and the second-biggest overall after Mohenjodaro. All the sites are maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. Agroha is another place of historical importance. It is situated about 24 km from the city and was once the capital of king Agrasena, who is believed to have lived during the last stages of Dvapara Yuga in the Mahabharat era. Remains of his capital have been excavated, known as Agroha Mound or locally as &quot;Ther&quot;, and belong to around 3000 BC. The city was also a major centre during the Mauryan period as Buddhist and Jain temples have also been revealed in the excavations.

Firoz Shah Palace Complex is another prominent historical site located inside the city. It was built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1354. Asigarh Fort, a centrally protected monument, was built in 1304–1305. Historical places from the British era include St. Thomas Church and Jahaj Kothi Museum, a Jain temple converted to a museum.

==Places of interest==
Balsamand, Siswal, Banawali, Kanwari, and Rakhigarhi are some of the sites of Indus Valley civilisation of now lost ancient Drishadvati river flowing through Hisar, Drishadvati river was a tributary of ancient Sarasvati River which still flows as remnant Ghaggar-Hakra River. Historic Agroha Mound and Agroha Dham is a prominent religious place located on the outskirts of the city about 22 km away on Fatehabad-Sirsa-Bhatinda road. A local deity Banbhori is worshipped by local people. Delhi Sultanate era Firoz Shah Palace Complex and Pranpir Badshah tomb are located in the city.

<text>The Police Dependants&#x27; Trust is a body which looks after the interest and welfare of the families of British police officers who have died or been incapacitated as a result of injury while on duty.

It was set up in 1966 from financial donations which flooded in after three officers in London were shot dead in cold blood by three men whose car they had stopped for a routine inspection (Massacre of Braybrook Street). The initial contributor was holiday camp owner Billy Butlin, who anonymously donated £100,000. Public donations soon swelled the fund to one million pounds.

The three killers were all given life sentences. One of them died behind bars in 1981, while another was released on licence after 25 years, he died, murdered, eight years later. Harry Roberts was released on licence in November 2014, after serving 48 years.

<text>Camooweal is an outback town and locality in the City of Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. The locality is on the Queensland border with the Northern Territory. In the , the locality of Camooweal had a population of 236 people.

== Geography ==
The locality of Camooweal is in north-western in the Gulf Region bounded by the west by the Northern Territory. The town of Camooweal is located in the south-west corner of the locality. The town is north-west of the city of Mount Isa and east of the Northern Territory border.

The Georgina River enters the locality from the west (Northern Territory), passes to the immediate west of the town and then exits to south of the locality (Barkly). Lake Francis () and Lake Canellan () are both on the Georgina River and lie to the south-east of the town. Lake Mary () is another lake on the river north-west of town.

The locality is a drainage divide running from the north-west to the south-east of the locality. The watercourses in the north and east of the locality are tributaries of the Nicholson River which flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north. Gulf drainage Whereas the watercourses in the south and west of the locality are tributaries of the Georgina River which is part of the Lake Eyre drainage basin.

Camooweal has the following mountains:

* Dog Tooth () 
* Quality Knobs () 

The Camooweal Caves National Park () is a protected area in the south-west of the locality to the south-east of the town. Crater of Caves is an area () within the park. Cavern is another area with caves but outside of the national park ().

Apart from the national park, the predominant land use in the locality is grazing on native vegetation.

== History ==
The area was originally inhabited by the Indjilandji Indigenous Australians.

William Landsborough in 1861 named the Barkly Tablelands after the Governor of Victoria, His Excellency, Sir Henry Barkly. He also named Lake Francis after his niece Frances Landsborough. The first European to attempt to colonise the area was George Sutherland, who took up the Rocklands lease in 1865. Sutherland arrived at Lake Mary on the Georgina River with 8,000 sheep, which caused the Aboriginal people, who were sleeping at time, to run. Sutherland was attacked by them on several occasions in the following months. When fellow colonists William Lyne and Henry Steiglitz arrived on the river, Sutherland &quot;deemed it fully time to make a raid and drive them [the Aboriginal people] back.&quot; One of the group fired a shot, hitting a group of boomerangs which scared the Aboriginal people into fleeing. Stock losses to the local dingos and wedge-tailed eagles; lack of water and isolation soon forced him to abandon his lease. The Englishmen Benjamin Crosthwaite and William Tetley, who were marginally more successful, took up the lease again in 1876.

The origin of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain. One theory is that it take its name from surveyor George Telford Weale, who surveyed the area using camels in the early 1880s. Another theory is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;strong wind&quot;.

The initial town was gazetted in 1884 to be built on a plot by Lake Francis. A year later the present site was re-gazetted. The Rocklands Post Office was removed and Camooweal Post Office opened on 27 April 1885. A police station opened in 1886.

Camooweal Provisional School opened on 5 June 1893. On 1 Jan 1909 it became Camooweal State School.

The town bore was drilled in 1897.

On 2 January 1931, a Qantas Air Ambulance from the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia flown by E.G. Donaldson rescued a man in Camooweal and delivered him to Brisbane.

The road through Camooweal to the Northern Territory (now the Barkly Highway) was the inland defence route for World War II. This road was built by army engineers and carried over 1000 vehicles a day and there are numerous historical sites marked along the road.

The town had electricity from 1952.

St Therese&#x27;s Catholic Church was officially opened on 30 April 1961 by Hugh Edward Ryan, Bishop of Townsville.

The Camooweal Caves National Park was gazetted on 16 December 1994.

Given the economic importance of transport on the Barkly Highway (the only sealed road between Queensland and the Northern Territory), a longstanding problem was the flooding of the Georgina River at Camooweal. During floods, the Barkly Highway bridge over the Georgina River was often unusable for many days, with road trains and other heavy vehicles having to wait weeks before it was safe to cross. To alleviate these problems, the new Georgina River Bridge was officially opened on 20 December 2002 by Senator Ron Boswell and Steve Breadhauer, Minister for Transport in the Queensland Government. It replaced the previous bridge which was approximately south and was both higher and longer so traffic on the highway could continue to cross during floods. The bridge is long and is accompanied by a highway deviation west from Camooweal. The bridge uses an unusual arch design to avoid placing pylons into the river bed which is culturally significant to the local Dugalunji people, who call the new bridge &quot;Ilaga Thuwani&quot; meaning &quot;The Camping Ground of the Rainbow Serpent&quot;.

In 2005 the Mount Isa City Council erected a war memorial outside the community hall (former shire hall of the Shire of Barkly Tableland).

<text>William Adams (c. 15851661) was a 17th-century London haberdasher born in Newport, Shropshire who, in 1656, founded Adams&#x27; Grammar School, now called [[Haberdashers&#x27; Adams]] School. Since his death in 1661, the school has been governed by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers.

In addition to the school, William Adams founded William Adams’ Eleemosynary Charity which built the almshouse cottages on the high street in Newport, on either side of the original school gates and on property surrounded by the school.

Tables representing the Will of William Adams hang in the &#x27;Big School&#x27; building of Haberdashers&#x27; Adams Grammar School, and the copying of these texts (known as Bill&#x27;s Will) was a common punishment for minor misdemeanours up until the end of the twentieth century.

<text>Flavius Caper was a Roman grammarian of Latin who flourished during the 2nd century AD.

Caper devoted special attention to the early Latin writers, and is highly spoken of by Priscian. Caper was the author of two works: &quot;De Lingua Latina&quot; and &quot;De Dubiis Generibus&quot;. These works in their original form are lost; but two short treatises entitled &quot;De Orthographia&quot; (by Agroecius) and &quot;De Verbis Dubiis&quot; have come down to us under his name, probably excerpts from the original works, with later additions by an unknown writer.

See F. Osann, &quot;De Flavio Capro&quot; (1849), and review by W Christ in &quot;Philologus&quot;, xviii.165–170 (1862), where several editions of other important grammarians are noticed; G. Keil, &quot;De Flavio Grammatico&quot;, in &quot;Dissertationes Halenses&quot;, x (1889); text in H. Keil&#x27;s &quot;Grammatici Latini&quot;, vii.

<text>Daniel Mark Nestor ( ; ; born Danijel Nestorović, September 4, 1972) is a Canadian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s doubles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 108 weeks (fifth-most of all time). Nestor won 95 ATP Tour-level doubles titles, including twelve majors (eight in men&#x27;s doubles and four in mixed doubles), an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and four Tour Finals. Nestor was the first man to complete the Big Titles sweep in doubles (winning every major and Masters event, the Tour Finals, and an Olympic gold medal over the course of a career), an achievement only matched by the Bryan brothers. He was part of the ATP Doubles Team of the Year in 2002 and 2004 (with Mark Knowles), and 2008 (with Nenad Zimonjić).

Nestor is widely considered one of the foremost doubles players in history, due to his longevity and continued success at the top of the game. , he is 10th for the most ATP Tour titles in Open Era history, and has the third-highest tally for doubles titles. In January 2016, Nestor became the first doubles player in ATP history to win 1000 matches. He was continuously ranked in the top 100 in doubles from April 1994 to April 2018, a total of 1134 consecutive weeks. Nestor retired at the end of the 2018 season, ending a 27-year career.

==Tennis career==
Nestor won his first doubles title in Bogotá, Colombia with Mark Knowles in 1994. They defeated French Open champions Luke and Murphy Jensen in the final.

He was a member of the Canadian Davis Cup team from 1992 to 2018. He first came to prominence in the public eye that year by defeating then world number one Stefan Edberg in a hard-fought singles match in Vancouver. He was part of the squad who made history for Canada in 2013 as they were the first Canadian team in the Open Era to reach the World Group semifinals.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Nestor and partner Sébastien Lareau won a gold medal, the first medal in tennis for Canada. The duo won four more titles together during their career, which was highlighted by an ATP Masters 1000 win in Canada. After the Olympics, Nestor won one title with Kevin Ullyett in November 2000 and two with Sandon Stolle in 2001.

On July 5, 2006, he participated in the second-longest match in Wimbledon history, lasting 6 hours and 9 minutes.

Nestor won three Grand Slam doubles titles together with longtime partner Mark Knowles of the Bahamas. The tandem won the 2002 Australian Open, the 2004 US Open and the 2007 French Open. He and Knowles also reached the final of the 1995 Australian Open, the 1998 French Open and US Open, the 2002 French Open and Wimbledon and the 2003 Australian Open.

In mixed doubles, he reached his first final at the 2003 US Open with Lina Krasnoroutskaya. He made it to the 2006 Australian Open and 2006 French Open finals, as well as winning the mixed doubles event at the 2007 Australian Open with partner Elena Likhovtseva.

2007 was a year of change for Nestor. He and long-time doubles partner Knowles announced that they were parting ways after the 2007 US Open (the two won 40 titles together, including 3 Grand Slams, 1 ATP year-end finals, and 15 ATP Masters 1000 titles), as Nestor began a new partnership with Nenad Zimonjić. Nestor and Zimonjić had actually won an ATP World Tour 250 Series event together back in 2001. They won the first title of their official partnership at the 2007 St. Petersburg Open, then advanced to the 2007 Paris Masters final as the second seeds, where they lost to No. 1 doubles team Bob and Mike Bryan. Nestor and Knowles partnered once more at the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup after having qualified for the year-end event as the top seed. Their finals win over Simon Aspelin and Julian Knowle earned them their first Tennis Masters Cup title at the year-end doubles tournament, and was a fitting end for one of the most successful doubles teams to ever play the game.

Nestor had chosen to partner with Zimonjić because he felt as though the game had transformed into a more powerful and physical version of doubles. The New York Times reported that &quot;on the tour, it&#x27;s known that they (Nestor and Zimonjić) joined up, after years in the top 5 with other partners, specifically to usurp the Bryans.&quot; In 2008 (their first full season), Nestor and Zimonjić won the first major title of their partnership at the Hamburg Masters. They reached the final of the French Open a week later. Nestor and Zimonjić then captured the 2008 Wimbledon title, winning over Jonas Björkman and Kevin Ullyett. This was Nestor&#x27;s first Wimbledon title, and in doing so, he completed a Career Grand/Golden Slam. The pair also captured the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup that year.

In 2009, the pair won Wimbledon again and eight additional titles, five of which were Masters 1000 events – personal bests for both in terms of numbers of Masters 1000 and overall titles won in a single year. In 2010, Nestor and Zimonjić won the French Open and were runners-up at the Australian Open. In October 2010, the duo announced that they would split up at the end of the 2010 season. However, they too, finished their partnership on a high note by winning the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Between 2008 and 2010, the duo won 21 ATP titles and reached 9 more finals. The pair won 27 titles together, which includes 3 Grand Slams, 2 ATP year-end finals, and 10 ATP Masters 1000 titles.

Nestor paired up with Max Mirnyi from 2011 to 2012. In his first tournament with Max Mirnyi in Brisbane, he won his 783rd career doubles match, overtaking Todd Woodbridge for the all-time match wins record. Nestor and Mirnyi won the 2011 French Open and the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals in London. In the final of the ATP World Tour Finals, he played his 1,148th match, an all-time record. Nestor won one more Grand Slam title with Mirnyi when they captured their second straight French Open in 2012. Nestor won a total of eight titles during his partnership with Mirnyi, which includes the 2 Grand Slams, 1 ATP year-end finals, and 1 ATP Masters 1000 title in Shanghai. Nestor won his second mixed doubles title at the 2011 Australian Open with Katarina Srebotnik.

Starting in January 2013, Nestor decided to partner with Mahesh Bhupathi. He however changed to play with Robert Lindstedt later during that year. In July, he won the 2013 Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Kristina Mladenovic and they also reached the 2013 French Open mixed doubles finals together. Nestor won his 81st doubles title, the Winston-Salem Open, in August with new partner Leander Paes. He also became the first player in ATP history to score 900 career doubles wins. With only one doubles title in 2013, it was the first year since 1999 in which Nestor failed to win four or more men&#x27;s doubles titles, and the first year since 1995 in which Nestor failed to win two or more men&#x27;s doubles titles. During the difficult year, he dropped out of the top 5 ATP rankings in June for the first time in 6 years, and ended the year 25th overall, his lowest doubles ranking since June 2000.

At the first tournament of his season, the 2014 Brisbane International, Nestor partnered with Mariusz Fyrstenberg and won his 82nd doubles title. Frysenberg was the 8th partner of Nestor&#x27;s career with which he won a doubles title. However, at the end of 2013, he had decided to team with former partner Nenad Zimonjić for the 2014 season, and the next week at the 2014 Apia International Sydney, Zimonjić helped Nestor capture his second doubles title in as many weeks. Nestor captured his third Australian Open mixed doubles title, his second Grand Slam title with Mladenovic. He won his third doubles title of the season and 84th of his career at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, surpassing Todd Woodbridge for 3rd overall in ATP history. His first ATP Masters 1000 title since Shanghai in 2011 also brought his ATP ranking up to 7th overall, pushing him back in the top 10 for the first time in nearly a year. The next week, Nestor and Zimonjić won their second consecutive Masters 1000 title at the 2014 Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia, making 2014 the first year since 2009 that Nestor won multiple Masters 1000 titles. Despite a disappointing finish at the US Open, Nestor rose to number 3 overall and he and Zimonjic clinched a spot in the ATP Tour finals following the tournament.

In January 2015 at the Apia International Sydney, Nestor won his 86th doubles title, putting him in sole position of 11th overall for ATP titles in the Open era. This was Nestor&#x27;s first title with new partner Rohan Bopanna, his 9th different partner. The same month, Nestor reached the mixed doubles final with Kristina Mladenovic at the Australian Open. He won his second doubles title of the season at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February. In August at the Cincinnati Masters, Nestor won his third title of the season and his first with new partner Édouard Roger-Vasselin.

In January 2016, Nestor and Radek Štěpánek became the oldest team to reach a Grand Slam men&#x27;s doubles final at the Australian Open, losing in three sets to Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares. In June at the Aegon Open Nottingham, Nestor won his first title of the season with his 11th different partner Dominic Inglot, making it 23 consecutive years with at least one men&#x27;s doubles title. He won his second doubles title in July at the Citi Open with Roger-Vasselin. While partnering again with Roger-Vasselin at the European Open in October, Nestor won his third title of the season and 91st overall.

On June 20, 2018, Nestor announced that he would retire in September 2018 after 28 career years. At the age of 46, he played his last professional match on September 15 at the Davis Cup World Group play-offs home tie against the Netherlands in Toronto partnering Vasek Pospisil, losing 6–4, 3–6, 4–6, 4–6 to Matwé Middelkoop and Jean-Julien Rojer.

==Personal life==
Born Danijel Nestorović (), his Serbian parents moved to Canada short of his fourth birthday in 1976 and settled in Toronto, where he attended Elkhorn public school and then Earl Haig Secondary School for a special sports program known as APGA (Academic Program for Gifted Athletes).

In July 2005, Nestor married Nataša Gavrilović () his girlfriend of two years. They welcomed their first daughter, Tiana Alexis, on December 15, 2008, only two weeks after his doubles partner Zimonjić and his wife had twins. Their second daughter, Bianca Willow, was born on March 2, 2013. The couple now resides in the Bahamas with their two children.

Nestor was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada (CM) in November 2010. On June 28, 2011, it was announced that Nestor would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and was inducted on October 1 at Elgin Theatre in Toronto.
