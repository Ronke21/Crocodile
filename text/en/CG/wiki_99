<text>The Marshall Scholarship is a postgraduate scholarship for &quot;intellectually distinguished young Americans [and] their country&#x27;s future leaders&quot; to study at any university in the United Kingdom. It is considered among the most prestigious scholarships for U.S. citizens, and along with the Fulbright Scholarship, it is the only broadly available scholarship available to Americans to study at any university in the United Kingdom.

Created by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1953 as a living gift to the United States in recognition of the generosity of Secretary of State George C. Marshall and the Marshall Plan in the wake of World War II, the goal of the scholarship was to strengthen the Special Relationship between the two countries for &quot;the good of mankind in this turbulent world.&quot; The scholarships are awarded by the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission and are largely funded by the British government. The program was also the first major co-educational British graduate scholarship; one-third of the inaugural cohort in 1954 were women. With nearly 1,000 university-endorsed applicants in recent years—along with many more who apply but do not receive their university&#x27;s endorsement—the Marshall Scholarship ranks among the most selective graduate scholarships for Americans. Among university-endorsed applicants, the acceptance rate typically ranges from three to four percent, reaching as low as 3.2 percent in 2015 and 3.6 percent for the 2025 class.

There are over 1,900 Marshall Scholar alumni. Many of these alumni have achieved distinctions and hold prestigious careers. In the government, current alumni include two Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the director of the CIA, members of Congress and presidential cabinets, and state governors. Alumni are CEOs of companies such as LinkedIn and Dolby Labs, and managing editors of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and CNN. They are also deans of Yale Law School, Stanford Law School, the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard College; and presidents of Duke University, Wellesley College, the Cooper Union, and Caltech. They also include two Nobel Laureates, a winner of the Kluge Prize, six Pulitzer Prize–winning authors, fourteen MacArthur Genius Grant awardees, NASA&#x27;s youngest astronaut, two Oscar nominees, and one awardee of the Distinguished Flying Cross for service during the Iraq War.

==History==
=== Founding and motivation ===
Plans to establish Marshall Scholarships as a living memorial to United States Secretary of State George C. Marshall was announced by British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden on 31 July 1952, and were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the Marshall Aid Commemoration Act 1953.

While the authors of the proposal initially considered partnering with the Rhodes Scholarship and even considered using the same selection committees, this idea was eventually disregarded because its proponents strongly believed the scholarships should be available to women, and to married men under the age of 28; at the time, the Rhodes Scholarship was limited to single men under the age of 25. The creation of a separate scholarship was a cause of great concern to Lord Godfrey Elton, the head of the Rhodes Trust at the time, who worried that the ability to study at other universities would draw potential applicants. He urged the Foreign Office to create a &quot;reverse exchange&quot; for British students in the United States instead. The Rhodes Scholarship became open to women beginning in 1977 following the passage of the British Sex Discrimination Act in 1975.

In 1959, when Parliament doubled the number of scholars from 12 to 24, British politician Philip Noel-Baker argued that &quot;Marshall, more than perhaps any other man, destroyed isolation in the United States and built up the conception that only collective security through international institutions can save the world...I think the world has never seen an act of greater national generosity than Marshall aid and the other aid which the United States has given to other continents throughout the last 15 years.&quot; By 1960, six years after its establishment, the scholarship was &quot;on its way to becoming as well-known and respected as the fellow phrase, &quot;Rhodes [Scholarship],&quot; and both scholarships attracted roughly 500 to 600 applicants.

As part of the celebrations for the 50th Anniversary of the Marshall Scholarships in 2003, a Marshall Medal was awarded to distinguished Americans in recognition of their contributions to UK-US relations, including Stephen Breyer (1959 Marshall Scholar), Ray Dolby (1957 Marshall Scholar), Thomas L. Friedman (1975 Marshall Scholar) and Nannerl Keohane (1961 Marshall Scholar).

In the early years of the Marshall Scholarship, it was common for new scholars to travel together to the UK on an ocean liner, but now scholars are usually flown together to London from Washington, D.C. following a welcome program at the White House with top United Kingdom and United States government and diplomatic officials. 

=== Evolution ===
In 1954, the first year Marshall Scholarships were awarded, 700 students applied, 74 were interviewed, and 12 were ultimately selected (eight men and four women). Two came from Stanford, and the rest from Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Kentucky, Oberlin, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

In 1956, Claremont McKenna student Hugh Gallagher became the first wheelchair user to be selected as a Marshall Scholar, which he used to study at Oxford. He went on to draft the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, which required that buildings built with federal funds be made accessible to all and was enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This was a precursor to the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. &quot;Hugh&#x27;s most outstanding contribution to the quality of life of people with disabilities was to successfully place disability rights on Congress&#x27; agenda for the first time,&quot; former Senate majority leader Bob Dole wrote for an event honoring Gallagher in 1995.

In 1963, Boston University graduate student John Willis became the African American to be selected for a Marshall Scholarship, which he used to study at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Willis became a professor emeritus of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University.

The number of scholars increased to thirty in 1973, forty in 1991, and 44 between 2004 and 2007. In 2010, the commission decided to offer a limited number of one-year awards. In 2016, the Foreign Office announced that forty scholars had been selected, a 25 percent increase over the originally planned 32, with Foreign Office Minister Alok Sharma calling it a demonstration of how &quot;resolute Britain is in its commitment to the special relationship.&quot;

On 7 June 2023, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, from his office at 10 Downing Street, announced an expansion to the funding allotted for Marshall Scholarships, writing in a press release that &quot;the number of Marshall scholarships will increase by 25%, to 50 places a year.&quot; Accordingly, 51 students were selected as 2024 Marshall Scholars, the largest cohort in the scholarship&#x27;s 70-year history. However, only 36 students were selected the next year as 2025 Marshall Scholars.

== Objectives ==
In a letter to the first class of Marshall Scholars, George Marshall echoed his own words in initially presenting his ideas for European recovery by saying, &quot;A close accord between our two countries is essential to the good of mankind in this turbulent world of today, and that is not possible without an intimate understanding of each other. These scholarships point the way to the continuation and growth of the understanding which found its necessity in the terrible struggle of the war years.&quot;

The published objectives of the Marshall Scholarships are outlined as follows:
# &quot;To enable intellectually distinguished young Americans, their country&#x27;s future leaders, to study in the UK.&quot;
# &quot;To help scholars gain an understanding and appreciation of contemporary Britain.&quot;
# &quot;To contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science, technology, the humanities and social sciences, and the creative arts at Britain&#x27;s centres of academic excellence.&quot;
# &quot;To motivate scholars to act as ambassadors from the U.S. to the UK and vice versa throughout their lives thus strengthening British American understanding.&quot;
# &quot;To promote the personal and academic fulfillment of each scholar.&quot;

== Selection ==

=== Selection criteria ===
The first proposed 1953 arrangement of the Marshall Scholarship, a 10-page document presented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Parliament by Command of Her Majesty, instructed selectors to &quot;look for distinction of intellect and character as evidenced both by their scholastic attainment and by other activities and achievements.&quot; It specified:Preference will be given to candidates who combine high academic ability with the capacity to play an active part in the life of the United Kingdom university to which they go. A Marshall scholar, as the possessor of a keen intellect and a broad outlook, would be thought of as a person who would contribute to the aims General Marshall had in mind when, speaking at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the 5th of June, 1947 of economic assistance for Europe, he said, &quot;An essential part of any successful action on the part of the United States is an understanding on the part of the American people of the character of the problem and the remedies to be applied. Political passion and prejudice should have no part. With foresight and the willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibilities which history has clearly placed upon our country, the difficulties...can and will be overcome.&quot;Prospective applicants must first be endorsed by their universities to apply. The selection process is then coordinated through the eight major British embassy/consulate regions in the United States (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.). Selection committees in each region, consisting of former scholars and other distinguished individuals, receive university-endorsed applications (including personal statements and essays) which are used to select a short list of candidates for interviews. Each committee then interviews each of the regional finalists before making the final decisions on the year&#x27;s awards. In 2014, sixteen percent of university-endorsed applicants received an interview.

Although most of the responsibility for selecting the recipients is in the hands of the committees, a few formal guidelines have been outlined in the official selection criteria, most notably:

As future leaders, with a lasting understanding of British society, Marshall Scholars will strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments, and their institutions. Marshall Scholars are talented, independent, and wide-ranging in their interests, and their time as Scholars will enhance their intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programmes will contribute to their ultimate personal success. In appointing Scholars the selectors will look for a distinction of intellect and character as evidenced both by their scholastic attainments and by their other activities and achievements. Preference will be given to candidates who display the potential to make a significant contribution to their own society. Selectors will also look for strong motivation and seriousness of purpose, including the presentation of a specific and realistic academic programme.Between 900 and 1000 students are typically endorsed to apply for the Marshall Scholarship annually. In 2015 and 2016, 3.2 and 3.5 percent of university-endorsed applicants to the Marshall Scholarship were elected. In 2020, 1,000 students were endorsed, 160 interviewed, and 46 selected.

The Marshall selection committees place a strong emphasis on academic achievement and potential, and as such the application requires a minimum GPA of 3.7. Successful applicants, however, typically have much higher GPAs—more than half of applicants have perfect academic records. Winners from Harvard University have had average GPA of 3.92, and Stanford University recommends that applicants have a GPA of 3.8 or above.

Between 1954 and 2022, 256 of 2,179 scholars received their undergraduate degrees from Harvard University (12 percent), 138 from Princeton University, 125 from Yale University, 94 from Stanford University, and 83 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among public universities, the top producers are the United States Military Academy, with 47 scholars, followed by the United States Naval Academy (34 scholars) and the University of California, Berkeley (33 scholars). The following table includes those institutions that have produced 30 or more scholars since 1954.

=== Scholarship terms ===
Marshall Scholars may study any full-time postgraduate course offered by a UK university excluding pre-professional programs, whether a taught master&#x27;s program, a research degree, or a PhD. The scholarship&#x27;s basic tenure is two years. University and college fees are paid by the British government. In addition, scholars receive a quarterly maintenance stipend to cover accommodation and living expenses.

== Academic destinations ==
Nine institutions are traditionally the main destinations of selected Marshall Scholars: University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, London School of Economics, University College London, University of Edinburgh, King&#x27;s College London and Imperial College London. SOAS and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine have also sometimes been highly preferred.

In 2015, there were 69 Marshall Scholars in residence at British universities including those who were selected for the classes of 2012, 2013 and 2014. During this time, there were 27 scholars at the University of Oxford, seventeen at the University of London (including five each at the London School of Economics and King&#x27;s College London, and one at University College London), thirteen at the University of Cambridge, and four at Imperial College London. Of these scholars, 46 were studying arts and social sciences while 23 were studying science, engineering or mathematics.

==Comparison to other post-graduate scholarships==

In structure and selection criteria, the Scholarship is most similar to the American Rhodes Scholarship and the Fulbright Program. Like the Fulbright available for study in the United Kingdom, Marshall Scholars can study at any university in the UK. However, under the Fulbright, applicants compete in separate pools for 43 specified universities of varying selectivity, except for two awards tenable at any university.

The Marshall Scholarship is more flexible than the Rhodes Scholarship, in that Marshall Scholars can study at any British university, and can also attend a different university each year during a Scholar&#x27;s tenure. In addition, a limited number of one-year Marshall scholarships are available. Unlike Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars must be American citizens (in comparison, approximately eighty Rhodes Scholarships are given annually to citizens of over a dozen countries). In the process, the Marshall Scholarship is roughly as selective as the Rhodes and Mitchell Scholarships: the Marshall was awarded to 3.4 percent of university-endorsed applicants in 2014, compared to 3.7 percent for the Rhodes in 2014, and 3.2 percent for the Mitchell Scholarship in 2017. In 2025, the 3.66 percent of university-endorsed applicants received the Marshall, compared to 3.70 percent of university-endorsed applicants for the Rhodes. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is slightly more selective with 1.3% of applicants receiving an award. Also, because the selection processes of the scholarships discussed above differ, the likelihood that an applicant will be granted a final round interview is different for each scholarship. In 2014, 15.9 percent of university-endorsed applicants for the Marshall Scholarship received a finalist interview, compared to 24 percent of Rhodes applicants and 5.4 percent of Mitchell applicants.

While the selection committees continue to emphasize academic potential, over time &quot;the Marshall program has become more Rhodes-like, stating that it is seeking persons who also demonstrate leadership potential.&quot; In general, &quot;nearly all Rhodes Scholars are willing to admit that, by and large, the Marshalls are superior if one looks just at grade point averages and other signs of academic achievement,&quot; but this is a point of both &quot;admiration&quot; and &quot;disdain.&quot; Walter Isaacson, describing Rhodes Scholars as &quot;fairly intelligent, well-rounded, honest people who could be counted on to be upstanding citizens,&quot; has said that &quot;the real geniuses...were the Marshall Scholars,&quot; perhaps because of the expectation that Rhodes Scholars be &quot;all-rounders.&quot; In practice, the Marshall and Rhodes have engaged an &quot;informal rivalry,&quot; but in career trajectory after the completion of their fellowships, &quot;the line between [the fellowships] is not so evident,&quot; with scholars pursuing similar fields with similar success. In general, a higher percentage of Marshall Scholars &quot;go on to careers in academia and research, whereas Rhodes Scholars are more evenly scattered through the full range of professional occupations.&quot;

==Association of Marshall Scholars==
The Association of Marshall Scholars (AMS) was formed in 1988 as a charitable organization.

The organization has been led by several notable board and advisory members, including Kathleen Sullivan, Reid Hoffman, Nannerl Keohane, Peter Orszag, Harold Koh, Roger Tsien and Daniel Yergin.

The Association of Marshall Scholars releases an annual public opinion poll in partnership with Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. The poll measures the American public&#x27;s perceptions of the United Kingdom, highlighting major current issues (e.g. Brexit).

=== The Marshall Forum ===
Every year, the Association of Marshall Scholars hosts the Marshall Forum, a high-profile dialogue engaging top American and British leaders about key transatlantic issues, in a different city. During Forums that take place during anniversaries of the Scholarship or Marshall Plan, the Marshall Medal is typically awarded to distinguished individuals who have advanced British-American understanding. These have included Lisa Cook (1986 Marshall Scholar), Madeleine Albright, and Anne Applebaum (1986 Marshall Scholar).

In 2017 the Association of Marshall Scholars, in partnership with the German Marshall Fund and the British Embassy, Washington, hosted the Harvard Marshall Forum at Harvard University to mark the 70th anniversary of the Marshall Plan and focused on its legacy and impact today. The event featured 30 speakers including Madeleine Albright as well as Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer and Neil Gorsuch, both Marshall Scholars.

In 2018, the AMS partnered with the British Consulate General in San Francisco and the Bechtel International Center at Stanford University to host a Marshall Forum on Innovation. The Forum focused on the pipeline of scientific invention in fields such as biomedicine and genetics that are of particular interest to the United States and the United Kingdom. Distinguished speakers included Reid Hoffman, a Marshall Scholar, and David Reitze, Director of LIGO Laboratory. The forum highlighted societal challenges and opportunities raised by explosive innovations in these fields as they interact with advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science.

In 2019, the AMS hosted the Marshall Forum with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on peace and prosperity. The Forum featured 17 speakers including the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, the Director of U.S. National Security Agency General Paul Nakasone, former U.S. ambassadors Michael Froman, Carla Hills, and William J. Burns, and former British Ambassador to the United States Kim Darroch.

<text>Rullepølse (, &quot;rolled sausage&quot;) is a traditional Danish cold cut. A piece of pork belly – variants use beef flank or lamb – is flattened out and is spread with herbs and seasoning (salt, pepper, allspice), chopped onions, and in some variants, parsley. It is then rolled up and placed in a brine for a number of days, before being boiled, placed in a special press, cooled, and sliced thinly. It is often used on &quot;rugbrød&quot; to make the traditional Danish open-faced sandwich, &quot;smørrebrød&quot;, usually garnished with a thick slice of &quot;sky&quot; and rings of raw onion.

Similar items also exist in a Swedish version, &quot;rullsylta&quot;, and a Norwegian version, &quot;ribberull&quot;, which is made of a lamb shoulder – boned, flattened, sewn to form a long rectangle, rolled, pressed, and steamed.

<doc id="1006407" wikidata="Q3704799" url="?curid=1006407" title="Deidre Downs">
<text>Deidre Downs Gunn (born July 7, 1980) is an American physician and former beauty pageant titleholder. Downs was Miss Alabama 2004 and later was crowned Miss America 2005.

==Education==
After graduating from Pelham High School in 1998, Downs attended the University of Virginia on a volleyball scholarship. While at the University of Virginia, she was an Echols Scholar and a member of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society. After her freshman year of college at the University of Virginia, Downs chose to focus on her studies and aspiration to go to medical school and ultimately transferred to Samford University. Her transfer resulted in her losing her scholarship, so she began competing in local pageants to earn scholarship money. She graduated magna cum laude in 2002 from Samford University with a degree in history and a double-minor in biology and chemistry. She was also a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship in 2002.

After completing her stint as Miss America, she began medical school at the University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) in Birmingham. She received her Doctor of Medicine in 2010 and then completed her residency in obstetrics and gynecology at the UAB Medical Center in 2014. She continued her education at the UAB Medical Center and completed her fellowship in reproductive endocrinology and infertility in 2017.

==Pageantry==
===Early pageants===

Downs competed in her high school&#x27;s pageants and won her senior year.

After her first year of college at the University of Virginia, Downs chose to focus on her studies and aspiration to go to medical school and ultimately transferred to Samford University. This transfer resulted in her losing a volleyball scholarship, so she began competing in local pageants to earn scholarship money.

She first entered the Miss Alabama pageant scene in 2000 and was named third runner-up at the 2001 and 2002 pageants and first runner-up at Miss Alabama 2003 pageant.

===Miss Alabama 2004===
She was named Miss Leeds Area 2004, making her eligible to compete at the 2005 Miss Alabama pageant.

Downs won the competition in June 2004, when she received her crown from outgoing Miss Alabama titleholder, Catherine Crosby. This was her 5th time competing in the Miss Alabama pageant.

===Miss America 2005===

Downs was Alabama&#x27;s representative at the Miss America 2005 competition held in Atlantic City, New Jersey in September 2004. Her platform was &quot;Curing Childhood Cancer.&quot;

In the preliminary competition, Downs was announced as the sole winner of the Quality of Life Award. For the talent portion of the competition, she sang Linda Eder&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid This Must be Love.&quot;

After competing in casual wear, swimsuit, evening gown, and participating in a &quot;pop quiz&quot;, only two state titleholders remained, Downs and Miss Louisiana 2004, Jennifer Dupont. She then beat out Dupont after a head-to-head talent competition for the 2005 title and was crowned by Miss America 2004, Ericka Dunlap, on September 18, 2004. Along with the title of Miss America, Downs also won a $50,000 scholarship. Downs was the third Miss Alabama titleholder to win the Miss America title.

Downs later stated that she received nearly $110,000 in scholarship money during the five years she competed in the Miss Alabama and Miss America organizations. Downs is the only titleholder to reign for part of three calendar years. The pageant, traditionally held in September, was delayed four months to allow the Miss America Organization to secure a TV deal. Her successor, Jennifer Berry of Oklahoma, was crowned Miss America 2006 on January 21, 2006.
Downs Gunn later served as a judge for the final night of competition for the Miss America 2014 pageant in which Nina Davuluri was named Miss America.

==Personal life==
After Downs married her college sweetheart, Andrew Gunn, in March 2008, she changed her name to Deidre Downs Gunn. They had a son in 2010. The couple later divorced.

Downs remarried in 2018 in a private ceremony at the Birmingham Museum of Art in Birmingham, Alabama. Her wife, Abbott Jones, is an attorney and writer. Downs is the first former Miss America national titleholder to enter a same-sex marriage.

<doc id="1006411" wikidata="Q72781" url="?curid=1006411" title="Privacy International">
<text>Privacy International (PI) is a UK-based registered charity that defends and promotes the right to privacy across the world. First formed in 1990, registered as a non-profit company in 2002 and as a charity in 2012, PI is based in London. Its current executive director, since 2012, is Dr Gus Hosein.

==Formation, background and objectives==
During 1990, in response to increasing awareness about the globalization of surveillance, more than a hundred privacy experts and human rights organizations from forty countries took steps to form an international organization for the protection of privacy.

Members of the new body, including computer professionals, academics, lawyers, journalists, jurists, and activists, had a common interest in promoting an international understanding of the importance of privacy and data protection. Meetings of the group, which took the name Privacy International (PI), were held throughout that year in North America, Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific, and members agreed to work toward the establishment of new forms of privacy advocacy at the international level. The initiative was convened and personally funded by British privacy activist Simon Davies who served as director of the organization until June 2012.

At the time, privacy advocacy within the non-government sector was fragmented and regionalized, while at the regulatory level there was little communication between privacy officials outside the European Union. Awareness of privacy issues at the international level was generated primarily through academic publications and international news reports but privacy campaigning at an international level until that time had not been feasible.

While there had for some years existed an annual international meeting of privacy regulators, the formation of Privacy International was the first successful attempt to establish a global focus on this emerging area of human rights. PI evolved as an independent, non-government network with the primary role of advocacy and support, but largely failed in its first decade to become a major international player. Most of its early campaigns were focused on Southeast Asia.

From 2011, Privacy International began to formalize and condense its operations. It is now a UK-registered charity (number 1147471) with twenty full-time members of staff and an office in Central London. As part of restructuring, an informal advisory board was replaced in 2012 by a managing 9 member board of trustees, including investigative journalist Heather Brooke and technologist Jerry Fishenden. The restructuring also established three major program areas: contesting surveillance, challenging data exploitation, and building a global privacy movement.

Privacy International&#x27;s Articles of Association state that the charity&#x27;s objective is to promote the human right of privacy throughout the world, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent United Nations conventions and declarations; specifically:

* To raise awareness of, to conduct research about, and to provide educational materials regarding threats to personal privacy;
* To monitor and report on surveillance methods and tactics employed against individuals and groups;
* To work at national and international levels toward the provision of strong and effective privacy protections;
* To monitor the nature, effectiveness and extent of measures to protect privacy, and to seek ways through information technology to protect personal information;
* To seek ways through which information technology can be used in the protection of privacy.

Privacy International has been funded and supported by a variety of foundations, academic establishments, and non-government organizations, including the Adessium Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, the International Research Development Centre, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, the University of Toronto&#x27;s Canada Centre for Global Security Studies in the Munk School of Global Affairs, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, The Fund for Constitutional Government, the Stern Foundation, the Privacy Foundation, the German Marshall Fund, the University of New South Wales, the German Permanent Mission to the UN, the Oak Foundation, the Renewable Freedom Foundation, the Omidyar Network, the Roughley Charitable Trust, the Swedish International Development Agency, and the Street Foundation. It also receives a small amount of finance via contributions.

==Campaigns, networking and research==

Throughout the 1990s, Privacy International was active in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, where it liaised with local human rights organizations to raise awareness about the development of national surveillance systems. From 2001 to 2010, the organization shifted much of its focus to issues concerning the EU and the United States. From 2011 onward, activities expanded to include a more aggressive program of legal action and international advocacy, particularly in the global south.

Since the late 1990s, the organization&#x27;s campaigns, media activities and projects have focused on a wide spectrum of issues, including Internet privacy, international government cooperation, passenger name record transfers, data protection law, anti-terrorism developments, freedom of information, Internet censorship, identity systems, corporate governance, the appointment of privacy regulators, cross-border data flows, data retention, judicial process, government consultation procedures, information security, national security, cybercrime, and aspects of around a hundred technologies and technology applications ranging from video surveillance to DNA profiling.

The PI network has also been used by law reform and human rights organizations in more than forty countries to campaign on local privacy issues. In Thailand and the Philippines, for example, Privacy International worked with local human rights bodies to develop national campaigns against the establishment of government identity card systems. In Canada, New Zealand, the United States, Hungary, Australia, and the United Kingdom it has promoted privacy issues through national media and through public campaigns. In Central and Eastern Europe, PI has been active in promoting government accountability through Freedom of information legislation.

PI monitors the activities of international organizations, including the European Union, the Council of Europe, and United Nations agencies. It has conducted numerous studies and reports, and provides commentary and analysis of contemporary policy and technology issues.

The charity is relatively small, comprising twenty full-time staff and a number of volunteers and interns. However the core team is supported in its project work by a collaborative network of around a hundred organizations in the fields of civil liberties, academia, technology assessment and human rights. These include, or have included, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Australian Privacy Foundation, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (US), Statewatch (UK), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (US), European Digital Rights, Consumers International, the Foundation for Information Policy Research (UK), Liberty (UK), the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, the Moscow Human Rights Network, Amnesty International, Privacy Ukraine, Quintessenz (Austria), Human Rights Watch, Bits of Freedom (Netherlands), freedominfo.org, Index on Censorship, the Association for Progressive Communications, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign, Charter88 (UK), the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, and the Thai Civil Liberties Union.

# &quot;R (Privacy International) v Commissioner for HM Revenue and Customs&quot;, on whether HMRC is permitted or required to give third parties information about its decisions, in particular on their decisions whether to prosecute, in the context of export controls on malware sold to repressive regimes

===Investigations===
Privacy International has conducted investigations on Thailand, Syria, Egypt, Uganda, Colombia, Pakistan, and Central Asia.

===Research projects===
PI has published around forty major research reports. These include studies on Internet censorship, communications data retention, counter-terrorism policies in the EU and the US, SWIFT auditing processes, travel surveillance, secrecy provisions and protection of sources, Internet privacy, policy laundering, free expression and privacy, the US-VISIT program, identity cards and counter-terrorism, encryption, the global surveillance industry, the UK&#x27;s 2016 Investigatory Powers Bill, gender issues and the right to privacy, and medical privacy.

===PI called on Swiss government to withdraw export licenses for monitoring technology===
In 2013, Privacy International publicized the links between several Swiss-based companies and the export of surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes including Turkmenistan and Oman and called on the Swiss government to withdraw relevant export licenses. The Swiss government later withdrew all export licenses for internet monitoring technology as well as several for mobile phone monitoring technology that were awaiting approval.

===European Data Protection Law===
From 2012 to 2015, Privacy International lobbied for greater data protection laws in Europe during formation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While praising certain provisions including the expansion of people&#x27;s rights over personal data, Privacy International claims potential loop holes and vague language make the GDPR fall short of fully safeguarding against unique 21st century threats to data protection.

===The International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance ===
In 2013, Privacy International together with Access Now and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched the &quot;International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance&quot;. These principles can provide civil society groups, industry, States, and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws and practices are consistent with international human rights law.

===Big Brother Incorporated===
In 1995, PI published a report on the international trade in surveillance technology, entitled &quot;Big Brother Incorporated&quot; and focusing on the sale of technologies by companies in Western countries to repressive regimes intent on using them as tools of political control. However, governments and regulators did not intervene and regulate the surveillance industry, the value of which is now estimated at around $5 billion a year. Exports of surveillance technology to foreign regimes are still wholly at the discretion of the exporter.

PI therefore commenced a second investigation in June 2011. The project, also called Big Brother Incorporated, uses a blend of research and investigation, public campaigning, political engagement, and strategic litigation to bring to light the abuses of the surveillance industry and to campaign for proper government regulation, specifically export control regimes.

In December 2011, Privacy International released documents collected from a number of surveillance trade shows and conferences (most prominently the ISS World conference in Washington DC) in collaboration with WikiLeaks, BuggedPlanet, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;espresso&quot;, &quot;The Hindu&quot;, ARD, and . The &quot;Spy Files&quot; included brochures, catalogues, technical specifications, contracts, and price lists for the products of around 160 companies.

During 2012, there was growing international awareness of the problems inherent in the rise of the surveillance industry and increasing momentum towards stricter regulation of surveillance technology exports. In March 2012, the EU banned the export of monitoring equipment to the Iranian authorities. The following month, a European Parliament resolution calling for stricter oversight of companies selling equipment to countries such as Syria or China was passed overwhelmingly, with 580 votes for, 28 against, and 74 abstentions. In July 2012, the French Minister for the Digital Economy, Fleur Pellerin, announced her opposition to exports of surveillance technology to repressive regimes during a radio show hosted by &quot;Le Monde&quot; and public broadcaster France Culture. In September 2012, comments made by the German Foreign Minister at an Internet and Human Rights conference in Berlin were interpreted by the German media as a clear statement of intent to push for tighter controls of EU surveillance technology exports at a national and European level.

===The SWIFT affair===
In June 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published details of a private arrangement between Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and the United States Government that involved the mass covert disclosure to the US of customer financial data. SWIFT is a cooperative involving around 8,000 financial institutions. It handles the secure messaging process at the heart of the majority of financial transfers worldwide, amounting to around $2,000 trillion per year.

The following week PI filed simultaneous complaints with Data Protection and Privacy regulators in 38 countries concerning the secret disclosures of records. The complaints alleged that the transfers violated EU law.

The PI complaints sparked a series of regulatory and legal actions that have ultimately forced SWIFT to re-evaluate its practices. The organisation has now agreed to move its data operations to Switzerland where US authorities have no jurisdiction.

===The Big Brother Awards===
In 1998, Privacy International took the decision to start an international gong called the Big Brother Awards to be given to the most influential and persistent privacy invaders, as well as to people and organizations who have excelled in defending privacy. To date, 75 awards ceremonies have been held as annual events in 17 countries including Japan, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Australia. France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Denmark, the United States, Spain, Finland and the United Kingdom.

===The Stupid Security competition===
In January 2003, PI launched an international competition to discover the world&#x27;s &quot;most pointless, intrusive and self-serving security initiatives&quot;. The &quot;Stupid Security&quot; award highlighted measures which are pointless and illusory, and which cause unnecessary distress, annoyance and unintended danger to the public. The competition resulted in over five thousand nominations from around the world. The winners were announced at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in New York on 3 April that year.

===Google Street View===
In March 2009, following the addition of 25 UK cities to Google&#x27;s Street View service, Privacy International sent a formal complaint about the service to the UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). The complaint cited more than 200 reports from members of the public who were identifiable on images hosted by the service. Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the &quot;clear embarrassment and damage&quot; Street View had caused on many Britons. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given to the ICO that had enabled its UK launch and asked for the system to be &quot;switched off&quot; while an investigation was completed.

The ICO had given permission for the launch of the service in July 2008 based partly on Google&#x27;s assurances that it would blur faces and vehicle licence plates to protect privacy. In its complaint, PI said that Google&#x27;s claim that its face blurring system would result in a few misses was a &quot;gross underestimation&quot; and meant that the data used by Street View would fall under the UK&#x27;s Data Protection Act 1998, which requires that subjects give permission for the use of information concerning them. However, the ICO rejected PI&#x27;s complaint, noting that removing the service would be &quot;disproportionate to the relatively small risk of privacy detriment&quot; and that &quot;Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act and, in any case, it is not in the public interest to turn the digital clock back&quot;.

===NSA-GCHQ tribunal case===

In February 2015 PI and other claimants won a judgment from the UK Tribunal that the mass surveillance conducted by the GCHQ with data from the NSA was illegal up to December 2014, being in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and lacking the necessary legal framework, whereupon PI launched a campaign enabling anyone in the world to ascertain (eventually) if the GCHQ illegally had their data from the NSA.

==PI and public controversy==
Privacy International&#x27;s unconventional and sometimes aggressive approach to privacy advocacy has at times resulted in controversy and a questioning of its motives.

The most notable political controversy surrounding the organization was sparked in 2005 when British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Home Secretary Charles Clarke publicly accused PI&#x27;s director and founder Simon Davies of covertly using his academic affiliation with the London School of Economics (LSE) to undermine the government&#x27;s plans for a national identity card. The LSE Director Sir Howard Davies strongly rebutted this charge. The government&#x27;s intent was apparently to raise doubts about the accuracy of the report in several areas and in particular, the manner in which projected cost estimates had been calculated (based on figures developed by the independent IT analysis company, Kable), and what it called &quot;selective and misleading use of evidence regarding biometrics and a failure to include any natural scientists to inform the report despite the significant claims made about biometrics and the accuracy of biometric technologies&quot;. Rather than address the issues raised by the report, several government politicians and their biometric experts instead chose to criticize the accuracy of the report, questioning whether the involvement of leading PI campaigners and well known opponents of identity cards meant that it could be considered unbiased. The episode is notable for the nature of its overtly political attack on an academic report from a leading UK university and its personalization of criticisms of Simon Davies. Even MPs who supported identity cards recognized that the government had entered new territory by undermining independent academic work on issues of legitimate contemporary interest.

The government&#x27;s claims of bias were strenuously denied by Simon Davies and resulted in heated debate between Government and Opposition parties both in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The coverage led Davies to draw comparisons of the argument with former government scientific advisor David Kelly who took his life following an allegedly similar campaign.

In his 2006 autobiography, another former Home Secretary David Blunkett wrote &quot;I am really sorry that the London School of Economics have allowed him (Davies) to even hint that he has any connection with them&quot;. Davies has lectured at the LSE since 1997 and continues to do so both as Visiting Fellow and as co-director of the LSE&#x27;s Policy Engagement Network.

In June 2007 PI released an assessment of the privacy practices of selected online services.

Simon Davies drew criticism for his apparent enthusiasm for aspects of Phorm&#x27;s model of operation, stating that &quot;[PI] DOES NOT endorse Phorm, though we do applaud a number of developments in its process.&quot; PI as a group has not published any analysis or comment concerning Phorm products.

In March 2009, following PI&#x27;s criticism of Google Street View service, Davies sent an open letter to Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, accusing the company of briefing journalists against him, by claiming Davies was biased in favor of Microsoft. Google pointed to connections between Microsoft and data protection consultancy 80/20 Thinking, run by Davies, and said that Davies&#x27;s connections to Microsoft should be made clear in public, as the credibility of his criticisms was undermined by the fact that he acted as a consultant to companies who are direct rivals and critics of Google; a fact Davies rarely disclosed in press releases or comments. 80/20 Thinking ceased operations in 2009.

==Privacy index==
Since 1997, Privacy International, in cooperation with the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), has conducted annual surveys in order to assess how much privacy nations&#x27; populations have from both corporative and government surveillance. The last global report was in 2007. Currently PI publishes State of Privacy reports with its partners, researching the legal and political situation in each country, updated yearly. It also regularly submits country reports to the Universal Periodic Review and the Human Rights Council.

In January 2011, Privacy International, in cooperation with EPIC and the Center for Media and Communications Studies (CMCS) published the &quot;European Privacy and Human Rights 2010&quot; report, funded by the European Commission&#x27;s Special Programme &quot;Fundamental Rights and Citizenship&quot;, 2007–13. This was an investigation of the European landscape of national privacy and data protection laws and regulations, as well as other laws, jurisprudence, and recent factual developments with an impact on privacy. The study consisted of 33 targeted reports, an overview presenting a comparative legal and policy analysis of main privacy topics and a privacy ranking for all the countries surveyed.

<text>Clarence is a small town in Canterbury, in the South Island of New Zealand. It was named after King William IV of the United Kingdom, who prior to his accession was Duke of Clarence.

It lies on State Highway 1, about north of Kaikōura, near the mouth of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River.

== Surfing ==
Clarence has several surf breaks near the river mouth. Due to their difficulty, they are recommended for advanced to expert surfers.

== River rafting ==
River rafting trips on the Waiau Toa / Clarence River have been run commercially since 1998.

== 2016 Kaikōura earthquake ==
Clarence and the surrounding area was significantly affected by the M7.8 2016 Kaikōura earthquake and cut off for some months from the rest of the South Island. The area was briefly evacuated following a slip upstream on the Waiau Toa / Clarence which caused a build up of water, threatening flash flooding in the town.

<doc id="1006420" wikidata="Q1192110" url="?curid=1006420" title="C-pop">
<text>C-pop is an abbreviation for Chinese popular music (), a loosely defined musical genre by artists originating from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (the Greater China region). This also includes countries where Chinese languages are used by parts of the population, such as Singapore and Malaysia. C-pop is used as an umbrella term covering not only Chinese pop but also R&amp;B, ballads, Chinese rock, Chinese hip hop and Chinese ambient music, although Chinese rock diverged during the early 1990s. 

There are currently three main subgenres within C-pop: Cantopop, Mandopop and Hokkien pop. The gap between Cantopop and Mandopop has been narrowing in the new millennium. Hokkien pop, initially strongly influenced by Japanese enka, has been re-integrating into C-pop and narrowing its trend of development towards Mandopop. 

Chinese popular music in China was initially a vehicle for the Cultural Revolution and Maoist ideologies; however, during the country&#x27;s extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, it has lost much political significance; and now closely resembles the styles of Taiwanese Mandopop, Cantopop, K-pop and J-pop, from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan, respectively. 

== History ==

The term &quot;shidaiqu&quot; (meaning &quot;music of the era&quot; or &quot;popular music&quot;) is used to describe all different types of music sung in Mandarin and other Chinese dialects recorded in China from 1920 to 1952, then in Hong Kong until the 1960s. Shanghai was the main hub of the Chinese popular music recording industry, and an important name of the period is composer Li Jinhui. Buck Clayton is credited with bringing American jazz influence to China and the music gained popularity in hangout quarters of nightclubs and dancehalls of major cities in the 1920s. A number of privately run radio stations from the late 1920s to the 1950s played C-pop. Around 1927, Li Jinhui composed &quot;&quot;Drizzle&quot;, sung by his daughter Li Minghui (), and this song is generally regarded as the first Chinese pop song. It fuses jazz and Chinese folk music – the tune is in the style of a traditional pentatonic folk melody, but the instrumentation is similar to that of an American jazz orchestra. The Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe founded by him was known as the cradle of C-pop.

Around the time of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and the Chinese Civil War, pop music was seen as a leftist undisturbed distraction. After the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II C-pop has been marketed, produced and branded regionally. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. One of its first actions was to label the genre &quot;Yellow Music&quot; (the color is associated with pornography). The Shanghai pop music industry then took pop music to Hong Kong and in the 1970s developed Cantopop. The Kuomintang, relocated to Taiwan, discouraged the use of native Taiwanese Hokkien dialect from the 1950s to the late 1980s. As a result, mandopop became the dominant musical genre in Taiwan.

In 2000 EolAsia.com was founded as the first online C-pop music portal in Hong Kong. The company survived the dot-com bubble and offered online legal music downloads in February 2005, backed by EMI, Warner Music and Sony BMG. It primarily targets consumers in Hong Kong and Macau: some songs require Hong Kong Identity Cards to purchase.

In August 2008 Norman Cheung, father of HK singer Ronald Cheng, acquired the remaining portion of EMI Music Asia when EMI, which had entered China in the early 20th century, withdrew from the Chinese market. Typhoon music made the purchase for an estimated HK$100 million.

In February 2008 mainland China&#x27;s top search engine Baidu.com was sued by local industry groups for providing music listening, broadcasting and downloading without approval. Piracy continues to exist in China but Google have since announced a cooperation deal offering free listening and genuine music copies. Top100.cn was founded by basketball star Yao Ming, agent Zhang Mingji and music insider Chen Ge via a 20 million yuan investment. Google mp3 became available in March 2009. The future of C-pop in mainland China is slowly emerging. However, the Chinese government&#x27;s banning of the highly popular show &quot;Super Girl&quot; for one year in 2008 and 2012 still a very controversial for the mainland China market.

In the early years of modern mainland China, emphasis on collectivist and party values, would predominantly set the theme for the music that was produced. Chinese officially sanctioned music schools, teaching popular music usually involves praising China&#x27;s national culture through song lyrics that echo the official orientation of the PRC. The way in which popular music is taught in the school system relates to Chinese patriotic verses and traditional Chinese culture. The educational policy is heavily influenced by the government, and the &quot;... Chinese government still uses traditional Chinese culture and values to enhance its legitimacy and consolidate its authority&quot; (Ho, 2012, p1).

After the Cultural Revolution that isolated China from the rest of the world for more than a decade, the country opened up, especially under the leadership of premier Deng. Global economic development offered all sorts of opportunities for Chinese businessmen and the opening up of east coast regions to outside economic interests served to boost significantly cross-cultural exchange between China and other nations, including the United States. Globalization and China&#x27;s joining the World Trade Organization, with the implication of a move to make institutions within the country more compatible with those of the rest of the world, and the surge in international trade all contributed to bringing not only increased economic activity but also social exposure to foreign cultural standards. Although the new openness affected relations with a broad range of foreign countries, the United States was especially important as it was a major trading partner, and globalization has helped both nations to develop a healthy relationship for future growth.

The openness to trade and other exchanges with the United States, including the growing number of Chinese students seeking admission to educational establishments in the US, facilitated familiarity with American popular music. Although this was not the first exposure to foreign music for China, as there had been a growing awareness of the unique brand of western influenced popular music in Hong Kong, known as Cantopop, the influences of American rock, and African American rebellious hip hop and rap music were undoubtedly a lot more accepted by Chinese youth compared to their parent&#x27;s generation. Nowadays mainland singers like Hua Chenyu, one of the most influential young pop-rock singers in China today, sold out an Olympic sized stadium concert in two minutes and 58 seconds, demonstrating the homegrown pop music of China are at the stage of strong mass appeal. (Rupke &amp; Blank, 2009). The globalization of popular music impacted other East Asian countries, especially Korea and Japan, and this in turn has influenced developments in China, as &quot;pop-culture excursions between (the) three countries&quot; are deemed significant (Tricks, 2014, p. 4).

<text>Kent County, area 2,458 km2 (949 sq mi) is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

The county was created in 1792 and named by John Graves Simcoe in honour of the English County. The county is in an alluvial plain between Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie, watered by two navigable streams, the Thames River and the Sydenham River.

On January 1, 1998, the county, its townships, towns, and Chatham were amalgamated into the single-tier city of Chatham-Kent.

Also referred to earlier as Camden Township and Gore, and in the 1861 census as Camden &amp; Gore Township. Containing some of the best farmland in Ontario, the township was originally parcelled as a grid with Concessions 1 to 7 running north-westward, Lots 1 to 18 running north-eastward and Concession A along the road to Thamesville. The Gore of Camden is a rectangular section of land in the north and northwest area of the township. The Camden Gore contains Concessions 1 to 14 running eastward and Lots 1 to 10 running northward.

<text>Agunnaryd is a locality and a parish situated in Ljungby Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden with 220 inhabitants in 2010.

Agunnaryd is chiefly associated with the industrialist Ingvar Kamprad, who founded IKEA (the &quot;A&quot; of which stands for &quot;Agunnaryd&quot;). It has one school, a kindergarten, a small supermarket named &#x27;Matöppet&#x27;, and four football teams. The little village has its own newspaper/newsletter, Agunnaryds Allehanda, that is mailed to inhabitants once a month.

The nearby lake of Agunnarydsjön, located some 300 meters from the village church, is a haven for fishing and swimming. The lake is part of the Helge å river system, extending further down into the lake of Möckeln, south of Agunnaryd.

The village&#x27;s vicinity offers plenty of opportunities to experience Swedish nature, e.g. of forest, ideally suited for hiking. The bicycle-route Sverigeleden passes right through the village. Canoeing on Helge å is a popular activity among tourists. In Agunnaryd, there are &quot;lay-bys&quot; by the stream to be used by canoeists.

In 2014 Ingvar Kamprad donated 53 million SEK (~US$7million) to the parish, for them to use at their discretion.

<text>Atomic Betty (retitled Atomic Betty: Mission Earth for its third and final season) is an animated television series produced by Atomic Cartoons, Breakthrough Entertainment, and Tele Images Kids, along with the Marathon Group joining for the third season. Additional funding for production is provided by Teletoon in Canada, Phil Roman Entertainment (uncredited) in the U.S. and M6 (seasons 1–2) and Télétoon (season 3) in France.

In Canada, the show originally aired on Teletoon from August 29, 2004, to January 29, 2008, lasting for three years. In France, this series aired on M6 from 2004 until 2005 and then on Télétoon+ from 2006 until 2008. From the U.S., this series premiered on Cartoon Network on September 17, 2004, until January 1, 2006, and The Hub (now known as &quot;Discovery Family&quot;) from 2010 until October 14, 2011, along with its third and final season.

==Synopsis==
Betty Barrett is a typical girl living in Moose Jaw Heights (a fictional suburb of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan) who enjoys school, daydreaming about living in outer space, sci-fi movies, and singing in her band. Unknown to all of her friends and family, however, she is also a member of the Galactic Guardians, an elite team dedicated to interstellar crime-fighting and law enforcement. As &quot;Atomic Betty&quot;, assisted by her two allies, the alien pilot Sparky and a robot named X-5, she confronts the evil overlord Maximus I.Q. and his servant Minimus, as well as other intergalactic supervillains, criminals, terrorists, and gangsters. Despite being rather unassuming on Earth, Atomic Betty is a superstar throughout the galaxy and even has a crowd of people who consider her their role model.

In each episode, a crisis occurs somewhere in the galaxy, usually while Betty is spending time with her friends and family. Invariably, her bracelet starts beeping, and she runs off alone to save the galaxy in her superpowered Galactic Guardian battle suit, which allows her to use a wide variety of weapons and gadgets. Accompanied by her crew, Betty takes initiative to fight the villains before returning home and explaining her absence.

The show includes frequent references to other well-known works of pop culture, especially sci-fi, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and &quot;Transformers&quot;.

== Characters ==
=== Main characters ===
* Betty Barrett (voiced by Tajja Isen), is the main title protagonist of the series. On Earth, to most of her friends and family, she is a typical preteen girl who enjoys visiting her grandmother, daydreaming about living in outer space, singing in her band, goofing off, and hanging out with her friends. She is not afraid to speak her mind, either, and dislikes any form of bullying, snobbery, and injustice. However, when there is trouble in deep space, she captains her own star-cruiser as Atomic Betty, a famously powerful and beautiful female Galactic Guardian and defender of the cosmos. In space, she investigates crimes and fights evil. Betty is very athletic; she is skilled at hand-to-hand combat, kickboxing, and karate, but is also equipped with a wide variety of Galactic Guardian-issued bracelet, housing a communications device and remote controls for her spaceship and its teleporter, as well as an array of gadgets and weapons. Her bracelet not only enables her to transform into her superpowered Galactic Guardian battle suit, but also has a holographic disguise function, and grants her basic telekinetic abilities as well. Betty had been the only one to object to Galactic Guardian Headquarters moving to Earth and her hometown, having preferred another planet (or even an isolated location on Earth&#x27;s area). In &quot;Mission: Earth&quot;, she has become more commanding in her Galactic Guardian duties, due to the stresses involved with Galactic Guardian Headquarters having moved to her hometown, the increased involvement of her spaceship crew in her daily life, her blooming romance with Penelope&#x27;s older brother Chaz, and the fact that an increasing number of villains have targeted Earth and her school area. It is never revealed how and at what age Betty was recruited to join the Galactic Guardians. However, some episodes have shown Betty training with her martial arts master, Spindly Tam Kanushu when she was younger in the planet, Bane of Fragnog. Also, in the first season, Betty at first thought that she was the only human ever to be chosen to be a Galactic Guardian, until she discovered her grandmother Bea was one of the first Galactic Guardians, under the name Beatrixo. Betty has long red hair, usually worn in a ponytail, and emerald green eyes. In &quot;Mission: Earth&quot; onward, on Earth, her new usual outfit worn on her body consists of her yellow short-sleeve tee shirt with green highlights and a big green nuclear symbol on the center and her blue long-leg full-length slacks with light blue cuffs on the bottom, but the rest of her original usual outfit from the show itself can still be worn on her body. When on a mission for action, she wears her standard Galactic Guardian uniform, which consists of her white head-dress, pink dress, white gloves, pink bracelet, white belt with a nuclear symbol, and white thigh-high boots. She also always sports red lipstick while using her suit.
* Sparky (voiced by Rick Miller) is Betty&#x27;s alien lieutenant and pilot, with a large nose, green skin, and blue hair. Although he is sometimes reckless, and often more interested in eating, surfing, or girls than the mission he is on, he is nevertheless very loyal to Betty and endeavors to do his best at all times. Also, despite his immaturity that he expresses in his quarreling with a fellow crew member, X-5, he is shown throughout the early series to be a very skilled pilot and combatant. With Galactic Guardian headquarters moved to Moose Jaw Heights following the events of &quot;No Space Like Home&quot;, Sparky has an increased presence in Betty&#x27;s personal life; he is a classmate of Betty purported to hail from Saskatoon. However, with more situations taking place on Earth, he has rarely seen piloting a ship and is often distracted when Betty needs his assistance. In &quot;Girl Power&quot;, Sparky is accidentally transformed into a girl via a magic crystal during a battle with Pontifidora. Sparky reacts positively to the transformation and even befriends Betty&#x27;s new friend, Regeena (while in girl form). Sparky is later returned to normal after the crystal is destroyed. Upon returning to normal Sparky admits he didn&#x27;t mind being a girl and would have preferred to remain that way. Afterward Sparky manages to pass himself off to Regeena as his girl self&#x27;s brother.
* X-5 (voiced by Bruce Hunter), the third member of Betty&#x27;s crew, is a roughly rectangular, yellow, hovering robot. He tends to spout too much information at inopportune times and takes things exceptionally seriously, which usually grates on Sparky&#x27;s nerves. The two of them have a grudgingly respectful working relationship. Though it is implied that he is an outdated robot model, newer model robots have tended to be less reliable. In the third season, he also becomes an inventor, inventing new gadgets that are used by Betty on her missions. When he visits Betty&#x27;s home, he tries to &quot;improve&quot; upon the kitchen appliances in Betty&#x27;s house, believing them to be primitive.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Atomic Cartoons, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, wrote the scripts and produced the animation for the show using Adobe Flash. Tele Images Kids produced animation and voice direction for the French-language version of the show. Breakthrough Films &amp; Television, through its distribution subsidiary, handled worldwide distribution outside of Canada, except Spain and Portugal.

Three seasons of the show were produced, totaling 78 half-hour or 156 quarter-hour episodes, depending on the format shown in each market. There is also a one-hour Christmas special titled &quot;Atomic Betty: The No-L 9&quot;.

===Cancelled sequel===
In 2010, Atomic Cartoons announced a sequel series was planned for a production titled Atomic Betty Redux. The show would have featured the 17-year-old Atomic Betty, her teenage future self that was first introduced in the two-part finale &quot;The Future Is Now!&quot;.

It was slated to be released either in late 2013 or mid-2014 but entered development hell shortly after. In early 2019, a Reddit user emailed Atomic Cartoons regarding the show, and the response was that the planned series had been cancelled due to the animation studio&#x27;s desire to focus on their new projects.

==Telecast and home media==
&quot;Atomic Betty&quot; premiered on Teletoon in Canada on August 29, 2004. The series was formerly aired on Cartoon Network from September 17, 2004, until January 1, 2006, in the U.S. and The Hub (now known as &quot;Discovery Family&quot;) from October 10, 2010, until October 12, 2011. It first aired on CITV in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2004, the show continued to broadcast and then re-broadcast on CITV until it was effectively taken off schedule after 6–7 years sometime in 2011. Starz Kids and Family formerly picked up the series, but only for its first season because the last two were too expensive for the Starz brand to afford until it was later removed from its weekday morning lineup. Recently, Kartoon Channel, a web-based cartoon streaming channel, is now airing all three seasons of the show. It also aired repeats in Canada on Cartoon Network until 2015 and BBC Kids until the channel was closed in 2018.

Warner Home Video (sister company to the show&#x27;s American broadcaster Cartoon Network) released two DVD volumes of the show on October 18, 2005, in Region 1 and February 6, 2006, in Japan. Each release contained eight segment-episodes from the first season. In the other two volumes, &quot;Betty Powers Up!&quot; and &quot;Betty Blasts Off!&quot; were planned but cancelled.

== Reception ==
&quot;Atomic Betty&quot; received positive-to-mixed reviews from critics and audiences but has since gained a cult following.

Emily Ashby of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the show a rate of four stars out of five, saying that the show is &quot;equal opportunity exists&quot; and &quot;[it] ups the ante on its TV peers by including some worthwhile messages as well.&quot; She also said that of the show&#x27;s content is &quot;nothing worrisome for its intended kid audience, aside from some mild potty humor and a smattering of brief scuffles between Betty&#x27;s team and the bad guys. In the end, though, none of these minor blemishes tarnish the show&#x27;s greatest asset -- its respectable heroine.&quot; Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; says that &quot;TBA&quot;.

==Merchandise==

===Soundtrack===
Atomic Betty is the official soundtrack to the television series of the same name. It was released by Koch Records (now MNRK Music Group) on November 8, 2005, and contains some tracks performed by the title character of the show, Betty Barrett, voiced by actress/singer Tajja Isen. She wrote and recorded that album in 2004. As of 2017, the album is still available on iTunes and Amazon.

===Video games===

A video game based on the show developed by Big Blue Bubble was released for the Game Boy Advance in Europe on August 25, 2005, and in North America on October 25, 2005. A Java game for mobile phones, titled &quot;Atomic Betty - Part 1&quot;, was developed by GlobalFun and Breakthrough New Media and published in 2010.

===Dolls and action figures===
Hong Kong-based toy company Playmates Toys was chosen during the initial run of the &quot;Atomic Betty&quot; TV show in Canada to produce a coinciding toy line. The toy line included a variety of Betty Barrett character dolls (made of rubber, cloth, nylon and silicone), which featured both her iconic pink-and-white dress, and her normal outfit, along with a yellow sweater and green skirt. The dolls featured nylon hair that could be brushed and styled, similar to popular fashion dolls at the time, such as Mattel&#x27;s Barbie and Bratz. A &quot;Talking Betty Doll&quot; was released in 2004, which would say the character&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Atomic Betty, reporting for duty!&quot; when a button on its belly was pressed. The doll was powered by AAA batteries and featured the same nylon hair as the smaller versions of the doll had. Other toys by Playmates included small plastic figurines of major supporting characters, and a large plastic &quot;Transforming Star Cruiser&quot; that certain Betty dolls could fit into and ride in. Outside of Canada, UK-based toy company Character produced a line of Betty Barrett dolls for British audiences, releasing a television commercial on CITV to advertise the dolls in 2005. Character&#x27;s doll line was very similar to the Playmates doll line, but Character only made dolls of Betty, not any supporting characters. Accessories included a plastic playhouse, which was styled similarly to the house that Betty lived in on the series.

<text>Domenico Rosselli ( 1439 – 1498) was an Italian sculptor.

Details of Rosselli&#x27;s life are limited, but he seems to have trained in Florence. He is best known for his work on many of the friezes, sculpted doorways and decorative fireplaces in the Ducal Palace in Urbino, most particularly the angel fireplace, which depicts the Camino angels, in the Sala degli Angeli. Some authors have also identified him as the Master of the Marble Madonnas, although the assertion is by no means certain. After working in Bologna, Italy in the year 1460 and then in Pisa, two years later, Domenico moved to Florence, but he left the city for the Marche region twelve years later.</text><links>

<text>The Airbus A350 is a long-range, wide-body twin-engine airliner developed and produced by Airbus.

The initial A350 design proposed in 2004, in response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, would have been a development of the Airbus A330 with composite wings, advanced winglets, and new efficient engines.
Due to inadequate market support, Airbus switched in 2006 to a clean-sheet &quot;XWB&quot; (eXtra Wide Body) design, powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB high bypass turbofan engines. The prototype first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was obtained in September 2014, followed by certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) two months later.
The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft largely made of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers.
The fuselage is designed around a 3-3-3 nine-across economy cross-section, an increase from the eight-across A330/A340 2-4-2 configuration. It has a common type rating with the A330.

The airliner has two variants: the A350-900 typically carries 300 to 350 passengers over a 15,000 kilometre (8,100 nmi; 9,300 mi) range, and has a 283 tonne (617,300 lb) maximum takeoff weight (MTOW); the longer A350-1000 accommodates 350 to 410 passengers and has a maximum range of 16,500 km (8,900 nmi; ) and a 322 tonne (710,000 lb) MTOW.
On 15 January 2015, the first A350-900 entered service with Qatar Airways, followed by the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same launch operator.

, Singapore Airlines is the largest operator with 65 aircraft in its fleet, while Turkish Airlines is the largest customer with 110 aircraft on order.

A total of 1,363 A350 family aircraft have been ordered and 644 delivered, of which 643 aircraft are in service with 38 operators. The global A350 fleet has completed more than 1.58 million flights on more than 1,240 routes, transporting more than 400 million passengers with one hull loss in an airport-safety–related accident.

It succeeds the A340 and competes against Boeing&#x27;s large long-haul twinjets, the Boeing 777, its future successor, the 777X, and the 787.

==Development==

===Background and early designs===
Airbus initially rejected Boeing&#x27;s claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed. When airlines urged Airbus to provide a competitor, Airbus initially proposed the &quot;A330-200Lite&quot;, a derivative of the A330 featuring improved aerodynamics and engines similar to those on the 787. The company planned to announce this version at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow, but did not proceed.

On 16 September 2004, Airbus president and chief executive officer Noël Forgeard confirmed the consideration of a new project during a private meeting with prospective customers. Forgeard did not give a project name, and did not state whether it would be an entirely new design or a modification of an existing product. Airline dissatisfaction with this proposal motivated Airbus to commit €4 billion to a new airliner design.
On 10 December 2004, Airbus&#x27; shareholders, EADS and BAE Systems, approved the &quot;authorisation to offer&quot; for the A350, expecting a 2010 service entry.
Airbus then expected to win more than half of the 250-300-seat aircraft market, estimated at 3,100 aircraft overall over 20 years.
Based on the A330, the 245-seat A350-800 was to fly over a 8,600 nmi (15,900 km; ) range and the 285-seat A350-900 over a 13,900 km (7,500 nmi; ) range.
Fuel efficiency would improve by over 10% with a mostly carbon fibre reinforced polymer wing and initial General Electric GEnx-72A1 engines, before offering a choice of powerplant.
It had a common fuselage cross-section with the A330 and also a new horizontal stabiliser.

On 13 June 2005 at the Paris Air Show, Middle Eastern carrier Qatar Airways announced that they had placed an order for 60 A350s. In September 2006 the airline signed a memorandum of understanding with General Electric (GE) to launch the GEnx-1A-72 engine for the new airliner model. Emirates sought a more improved design and decided against ordering the initial version of the A350.

On 6 October 2005, the programme&#x27;s industrial launch was announced with an estimated development cost of around €3.5 billion. The A350 was initially planned to be a 250 to 300-seat twin-engine wide-body aircraft derived from the existing A330&#x27;s design. Under this plan, the A350 would have modified wings and new engines while sharing the A330&#x27;s fuselage cross-section. For this design, the fuselage was to consist primarily of aluminium-lithium rather than the carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) fuselage on the Boeing 787. The A350 would see entry in two versions: the A350-800 with a range with a typical passenger capacity of 253 in a three-class configuration, and the A350-900 with range and a 300-seat three-class configuration. The A350 was designed to be a direct competitor to the Boeing 787-9 and 777-200ER.

The original A350 design was publicly criticised by two of Airbus&#x27;s largest customers, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). On 28 March 2006, ILFC President Steven F. Udvar-Házy urged Airbus to pursue a clean-sheet design or risk losing market share to Boeing and branded Airbus&#x27;s strategy as &quot;a Band-aid reaction to the 787&quot;, a sentiment echoed by GECAS president Henry Hubschman. In April 2006, while reviewing bids for the Boeing 787 and A350, the CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chew Choon Seng, commented that &quot;having gone through the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, and cockpit, [Airbus] should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage.&quot;

Airbus responded that they were considering A350 improvements to satisfy customer demands. Airbus&#x27;s then-CEO Gustav Humbert stated, &quot;Our strategy isn&#x27;t driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises.&quot; As major airlines such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines selected the 787 over the A350, Humbert tasked an engineering team to produce new alternative designs. One such proposal, known internally as &quot;1d&quot;, formed the basis of the A350 redesign.

===Redesign and launch===
On 14 July 2006, during the Farnborough International Airshow, the redesigned aircraft was designated &quot;A350 XWB&quot; (Xtra-Wide-Body). Within four days, Singapore Airlines agreed to order 20 A350 XWBs with options for another 20 A350 XWBs.

The proposed A350 was a new design, including a wider fuselage cross-section, allowing seating arrangements ranging from an eight-across low-density premium economy layout to a ten-across high-density seating configuration for a maximum seating capacity of 440–475 depending on variant. The A330 and previous iterations of the A350 would only be able to accommodate a maximum of eight seats per row. The 787 is typically configured for nine seats per row. The 777 accommodates nine or ten seats per row, with more than half of recent 777s being configured in a ten-across layout that will come standard on the 777X. The A350 cabin is wider at the eye level of a seated passenger than the 787&#x27;s cabin, and narrower than the Boeing 777&#x27;s cabin (see the Wide-body aircraft comparison of cabin widths and seating). All A350 passenger models have a range of at least . The redesigned composite fuselage allows for higher cabin pressure and humidity, and lower maintenance costs.

On 1 December 2006, the Airbus board of directors approved the industrial launch of the A350-800, -900, and -1000 variants. The delayed launch decision was a result of delays to the Airbus A380 and discussions on how to fund development. EADS CEO Thomas Enders stated that the A350 programme was not a certainty, citing EADS/Airbus&#x27;s stretched resources. However, it was decided programme costs are to be borne mainly from cash-flow. First delivery for the A350-900 was scheduled for mid-2013, with the -800 and -1000 following on 12 and 24 months later, respectively. New technical details of the A350 XWB were revealed at a press conference in December 2006. Chief operating officer, John Leahy indicated existing A350 contracts were being re-negotiated due to price increases compared to the original A350s contracted. On 4 January 2007, Pegasus Aviation Finance Company placed the first firm order for the A350 XWB with an order for two aircraft.

The design change imposed a two-year delay into the original timetable and increased development costs from US$5.5 billion (€5.3 billion) to approximately US$10 billion (€9.7 billion). &quot;Reuters&quot; estimated the A350&#x27;s total development cost at US$15 billion (€12 billion or £10 billion). The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 was changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to the third quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight test schedule was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months. A350 programme chief Didier Evrard stressed that delays only affected the A350-900 while the -800 and -1000 schedules remained unchanged.
Airbus&#x27; 2019 earnings report indicated the A350 programme had broken even that year.

===Design phase===
Airbus suggested Boeing&#x27;s use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature carbon fibre panels only for the main fuselage skin. However, after facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 that it would also use carbon fibre for fuselage frames. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage, for dissipating lightning strikes. Airbus used a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.

In 2006, Airbus confirmed development of a full bleed air system on the A350, as opposed to the 787&#x27;s bleedless configuration. Rolls-Royce agreed with Airbus to supply a new variant of the Trent turbofan engine for the A350 XWB, named &quot;Trent XWB&quot;. In 2010, after low-speed wind tunnel tests, Airbus finalised the static thrust at sea level for all three proposed variants to the range.

GE stated it would not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 did not apply to the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt &amp; Whitney seemed to be unaligned with GE on this, having publicly stated that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, former Airbus CEO Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it could offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants.

In January 2008, French-based Thales Group won a US$2.9 billion (€2 billion) 20-year contract to supply avionics and navigation equipment for the A350 XWB, beating Honeywell and Rockwell Collins. US-based Rockwell Collins and Moog Inc. were chosen to supply the horizontal stabiliser actuator and primary flight control actuation, respectively. The flight management system incorporated several new safety features. Regarding cabin ergonomics and entertainment, in 2006 Airbus signed a firm contract with BMW for development of an interior concept for the original A350. On 4 February 2010, Airbus signed a contract with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to deliver in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) systems for the Airbus A350 XWB.

===Production===
In 2008, Airbus planned to start cabin furnishing early in parallel with final assembly to cut production time in half. The A350 XWB production programme sees extensive international collaboration and investments in new facilities: Airbus constructed 10 new factories in Western Europe and the US, with extensions carried out on three further sites.

Among the new buildings was a £570 million (US$760 million or €745 million) composite facility in Broughton, Wales, which would be responsible for the wings. In June 2009, the National Assembly for Wales announced provision of a £28 million grant to provide a training centre, production jobs and money toward the new production centre.

Airbus manufactured the first structural component in December 2009. Production of the first fuselage barrel began in late 2010 at its production plant in Illescas, Spain. Construction of the first A350-900 centre wingbox was set to start in August 2010. The new composite rudder plant in China opened in early 2011. The forward fuselage of the first A350 was delivered to the final assembly plant in Toulouse on 29 December 2011. Final assembly of the first A350 static test model was started on 5 April 2012. Final assembly of the first prototype A350 was completed in December 2012.

In 2018, the unit cost of the A350-900 was US$317.4 million and the A350-1000 was US$366.5 million.
The production rate was expected to rise from three aircraft per month in early 2015 to five at the end of 2015, and would ramp to ten aircraft per month by 2018. In 2015, 17 planes would be delivered and the initial dispatch reliability was 98%. Airbus announced plans to increase its production rate from 10 monthly in 2018 to 13 monthly from 2019 and six A330 are produced monthly.

Around 90 deliveries were expected for 2018, with 15% or ≈ units being A350-1000 variants. That year, 93 aircraft were delivered, three more than expected. In 2019, Airbus delivered 112 A350s (87 A350-900s and 25 A350-1000s) at a rate of 10 per month, and were going to keep the rate around nine to 10 per month, to reflect softer demand for widebodies, as the backlog reached 579 − or years of production at a constant rate.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the decrease of A350 production from 9.5 per month to six per month, since April 2020. After the pandemic a ramp-up is planned, aiming to reach a rate of 9 per month by the end of 2025. As the pre-pandemic rate of 10 monthly is aimed for by 2026, by April 2024 Airbus was planning a 12-monthly production rate by 2028 after securing 281 net orders in 2023.

===Testing and certification===
The first Trent engine test was made on 14 June 2010. The Trent XWB&#x27;s flight test programme began use on the A380 development aircraft in early 2011, ahead of engine certification in late 2011. On 2 June 2013, the Trent XWB engines were powered up on the A350 for the first time. Airbus confirmed that the flight test programme would last 12 months and use five test aircraft.

The A350&#x27;s maiden flight took place on 14 June 2013 from the Toulouse–Blagnac Airport. Airbus&#x27;s chief test pilot said, &quot;it just seemed really happy in the air...all the things we were testing had no major issues at all.&quot; It flew for four hours, reaching Mach 0.8 at 25,000 feet after retracting the landing gear and starting a 2,500 h flight test campaign. Costs for developing the aircraft were estimated at €11 billion (US$15 billion or £9.5 billion) in June 2013.

A350 XWB msn. 2 underwent two and a half weeks of climatic tests in the unique McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in May 2014, and was subjected to multiple climatic and humidity settings from to .

The A350 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 30 September 2014. On 15 October 2014, EASA approved the A350-900 for ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operations Performance Standards) 370, allowing it to fly more than six hours on one engine and making it the first airliner to be approved for &quot;ETOPS Beyond 180 minutes&quot; before entry into service. Later that month Airbus received regulatory approval for a Common Type Rating for pilot training between the A350 XWB and A330. On 12 November 2014, the A350 received certification from the FAA. On 1 August 2017, the EASA issued an airworthiness directive mandating operators to power cycle (reset) early A350-900s before 149 hours of continuous power-on time, reissued in July 2019.

===Entry into service===
In June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017. In July 2012, Airbus delayed the -900&#x27;s introduction by three months to the second half of 2014. The delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways took place on 22 December 2014. The first commercial flight was made on 15 January 2015 between Doha and Frankfurt.

The first A350-1000 was assembled in 2016 and had its first flight on 24 November 2016. The aircraft was then delivered on 20 February 2018 to Qatar Airways, which had also been the launch operator of the -900. and entered the commercial service with a flight from Doha to London on 24 February 2018.

===Shorter A350-800===
The -long A350-800 was designed to seat 276 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of with an MTOW of .

In January 2010, Airbus opted to develop the -800 as a shrink of the baseline -900 to simplify development and increase its payload by or its range by , but this led to a fuel burn penalty of &quot;a couple of percent&quot;, according to John Leahy. The previously planned optimisation to the structure and landing gear was not beneficial enough against better commonality and maximum takeoff weight increase by 11t from 248t. The −800&#x27;s fuselage is 10 frames shorter (six forward and four aft of wing) than the −900 aircraft. It was designed to supplement the Airbus A330-200 long-range twin. Airbus planned to decrease structural weight in the -800 as development continued, which should have been around airframe 20.

While its backlog reached 182 in mid-2008, it diminished since 2010 as customers switched to the larger -900. After launching the Airbus A330neo at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow, Airbus dropped the A350-800, with its CEO Fabrice Brégier saying &quot;I believe all of our customers will either convert to the A350-900 or the A330neo&quot;. He later confirmed at a September 2014 press conference that development of the A350-800 had been &quot;cancelled&quot;. There were 16 orders left for the -800 since Yemenia switched to the -900 and Hawaiian Airlines moved to the A330neo in December 2014: eight for Aeroflot and eight for Asiana Airlines, both also having orders for the -900. In January 2017, Aeroflot and Airbus announced the cancellation of its -800 order, leaving Asiana Airlines as the only customer for the variant. After the negotiation between Airbus and Asiana Airlines, Asiana converted orders of eight A350-800s and one A350-1000 to nine A350-900s.

===Longer A350-1000===
In 2011, Airbus redesigned the A350-1000 with higher weights and a more powerful engine variant to provide more range for trans-Pacific operations. This boosted its appeal to Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, who were committed to purchase 20 Boeing 777-9s, and to United Airlines, which was considering Boeing 777-300ERs to replace its 747-400s. Emirates was disappointed with the changes and cancelled its order for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, instead of changing the whole order to the larger variant.

Assembly of the first fuselage major components started in September 2015. In February 2016, final assembly started at the A350 Final Assembly Line in Toulouse. Three flight test aircraft were planned, with entry into service scheduled for mid-2017. The first aircraft completed its body join on 15 April 2016. Its maiden flight took place on 24 November 2016.

The A350-1000 flight test programme planned for 1,600 flight hours; 600 hours on the first aircraft, MSN59, for the flight envelope, systems and powerplant checks; 500 hours on MSN71 for cold and warm campaigns, landing gear checks and high-altitude tests; and 500 hours on MSN65 for route proving and ETOPS assessment, with an interior layout for cabin development and certification. In cruise at and 35,000 ft, its fuel flow at is per hour within a , hours early long test flight. Flight tests allowed raising the MTOW from , the increase giving more range. Airbus then completed functional and reliability testing.

Type Certification was awarded by EASA on 21 November 2017, along FAA certification. The first serial unit was on the final assembly line in early December. After its maiden flight on 7 December 2017, delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways slipped to early 2018. The delay was due to issues with the business class seat installation. It was delivered on 20 February 2018 and entered commercial service on Qatar Airways&#x27; Doha to London Heathrow route on 24 February 2018.

===Possible further stretch===
Airbus has explored the possibility of a further stretch offering 45 more seats. A potential stretch would remain within the exit limit of four door pairs, and a modest MTOW increase from 308 t to 319 t would need only 3% more thrust, within the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 capabilities, and would allow a range to compete with the 777-9&#x27;s capabilities. This variant was to be a replacement for the 747-400, tentatively called the A350-8000, -2000 or -1100.

At the June 2016 Airbus Innovation Days, chief commercial officer John Leahy was concerned about the size of a 400-seat market besides the Boeing 747-8 and the 777-9 and chief executive Fabrice Brégier feared such an aircraft could cannibalise demand for the -1000. The potential aeroplane was competing against a hypothetical 777-10X for Singapore Airlines. At the 2017 Paris Air Show, the concept was shelved for lacking market appeal and in January 2018 Brégier focused on enhancing the A350-900/1000 to capture potential before 2022/2023, when it would be possible to stretch the A350 with a new engine generation.

===Improvements===

==== Performance improvement package (PIP) 2017 ====
In October 2017, Airbus was testing extended sharklets as part of the upcoming performance improvement package (PIP), which could offer extra range and reduce fuel burn by 1.4–1.6%. The wing twist is being changed for the wider, optimised spanload pressure distribution, and will be used for the Singapore Airlines A350-900ULR in 2018 before spreading to other variants.
On 26 June 2018, Iberia was the first to receive the upgraded -900, with a MTOW version for an range with 325 passengers in three classes. This eventually became a standard package for all the A350-900 airframes starting from MSN 216.

==== Hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) ====
By April 2019, Airbus was testing a hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) on the leading edge of an A350 prototype vertical stabiliser, with passive suction similar to the boundary layer control on the Boeing 787-9 tail, but unlike the natural laminar flow BLADE, within the same EU Clean Sky programme.

==== New production standard (NPS) 2022 ====
On 30 September 2022, an improved new production standard (NPS) was announced, it will apply to A359/A35K airframes starting from MSN 579, which is an A350-900 airframe that was delivered to Iberia. The NPS includes a weight reduction and a MTOW increase, along with a wider interior cabin to offer 30 additional seats.
It offers the customers with a new weight variant WV020 for the 283t MTOW. The interior changes include moving the cockpit wall forward, moving the aft pressure bulkhead one frame further aft and resculpting the sidewalls to allow ten-across 17-inch seats. Also there are improvements to the aircraft’s take off performance by introducing software evolutions which regulate the slat and flap positions, and has also implemented a faster landing gear retraction cycle – conferring greater obstacle clearance and reduced aerodynamic drag. 

===New Engine Option===
By November 2018, Airbus was hiring in Toulouse and Madrid to develop a re-engined A350neo. Although its launch is not guaranteed, it would be delivered in the mid-2020s, after the A321XLR and a stretched A320neo &quot;plus&quot;, potentially competing with the Boeing New Midsize Airplane. Service entry would be determined by ultra-high bypass ratio engine developments pursued by Pratt &amp; Whitney, testing its Geared Turbofan upgrade; Safran Aircraft Engines, ground testing a demonstrator from 2021; and Rolls-Royce, targeting a 2025 Ultrafan service entry. The production target is a monthly rate of 20 A350neos, up from 10.

In November 2019, General Electric was offering an advanced GEnx-1 variant with a bleed air system and improvements from the GE9X, developed for the delayed Boeing 777X, to power a proposed A350neo from the mid-2020s. In 2021, Rolls Royce signed an exclusive deal to supply A350-900 engines until 2030, following previous similar commitments for the A350-1000.

==Design==

Airbus expected 10% lower airframe maintenance compared with the original A350 design and 14% lower empty seat weight than the Boeing 777. Design freeze for the A350-900 was achieved in December 2008.
The airframe is made out of 53% composites: CFRP for the empennage (vertical and horizontal tailplanes), the wing (centre and outer box; including covers, stringers, and spars), and fuselage (keel beam, rear fuselage, skin, and frame); 19% aluminium and aluminium–lithium alloy for ribs, floor beams, and gear bays; 14% titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6% steel; and 8% miscellaneous. The A350&#x27;s competitor, the Boeing 787, is 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel, and 5% other.

===Fuselage===
The A350 features a new composite fuselage with a constant width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume. The double-lobe (ovoid) fuselage cross-section has a maximum outer diameter of , compared to for the A330/A340. The cabin&#x27;s internal width is at armrest level compared to in the Boeing 787 and in the Boeing 777. It allows for an eight-across 2–4–2 arrangement in a premium economy layout, with the seats being wide between wide arm rests. Airbus states that the seat will be wider than a 787 seat in the equivalent configuration.

In the nine-across, 3–3–3 standard economy layout, the A350 seat will be wide, wider than a seat in the equivalent layout in the 787, and wider than a seat in the equivalent A330 layout. The current 777 and future derivatives have greater seat width than the A350 in a nine-across configuration. The 10-across seating on the A350 is similar to a 9-across configuration on the A330, with a seat width of . Overall, the A350 gives passengers more headroom, larger overhead storage space, and wider panoramic windows than current Airbus models.

The A350 nose section has a configuration derived from the A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original A350 XWB design. The new nose, made of aluminium, improves aerodynamics and enables overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing the width of the centre post. The upper shell radius of the nose section has been increased.

The Airbus A350 initially featured manual window shades. In 2020, Airbus announced that dimmable windows, similar to those on the Boeing 787, would be offered as an option. These windows are designed to darken or lighten more efficiently, providing greater control over light levels while maintaining an outside view. Starlux Airlines became the first carrier to receive A350s equipped with dimmable windows across all cabins, while Japan Airlines offers this feature exclusively in premium economy and higher-class cabins, retaining manual shades for economy passengers.

===Wing===
The A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the proposed variants. Its wingspan stays within the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code E 65 m limit as the A330/A340 and the Boeing 777. The A350&#x27;s wing has a 31.9° sweep angle for a Mach 0.85 cruise speed and has a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.89.

The -900 wing has an area of . This is between the wing of the current Boeing 777-200LR/300ER and the wing of the in-development Boeing 777X. However, Boeing and Airbus do not use the same measurement. The A350-1000 wing is () larger through a () extension to the inboard sections of the fixed trailing edge.

A new trailing-edge high-lift device has been adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap similar to that of the A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard &amp; outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard &amp; outboard flaps deflect differentially.

The manufacturer has extensively used computational fluid dynamics and also carried out more than 4,000 hours of low- and high-speed windtunnel testing to refine the aerodynamic design. The final configuration of wing and winglet was achieved for the &quot;Maturity Gate 5&quot; on 17 December 2008. The wingtip device curves upwards over the final . The wings are produced in the new £400 million (US$M), North Factory at Airbus Broughton, employing 650 workers, in a specialist facility constructed with £29M of support from the Welsh Government.

===Undercarriage===
Airbus adopted a new philosophy for the attachment of the A350&#x27;s main undercarriage as part of the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.

Airbus devised a three-pronged main undercarriage design philosophy encompassing both four- and six-wheel bogies to stay within pavement loading limits. The A350-900 has four-wheel bogies in a long bay. The higher weight variant, the A350-1000 uses a six-wheel bogie, with a undercarriage bay. French-based Messier-Dowty provides the main undercarriage for the -900 variant, with titanium forgings from Kobelco, and UTC Aerospace Systems supplies the -1000 variant. The nose gear is supplied by Liebherr Aerospace.

===Systems===

Honeywell supplies its HGT1700 auxiliary power unit with 10% greater power density than the TPE331 from which it is developed, and the air management system: the bleed air, environmental control, cabin pressure control and supplemental cooling systems. Airbus says that the new design provides a better cabin atmosphere with 20% humidity, a typical cabin altitude at or below and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation.

The ram air turbine, with a nominal power of 50 kilovolt-ampere, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and located in the lower surface of the fuselage. In light of the 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven nickel-cadmium technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems. In late 2015, A350 XWB msn. 24 was delivered with lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd&#x27;s 4–6 months.

Parker Hannifin supplies the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air to reduce the flammability of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, thermal control, isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than US$2 billion in revenues over the life of the programme.

===Cockpit and avionics===
The revised design of the A350 XWB&#x27;s glass cockpit dropped the A380-sized display and adopted liquid-crystal display screens. The new six-screen configuration includes two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one above the thrust levers) and a single (for each pilot) primary flight/navigation display, with an adjacent on-board information system screen driven by laptops running EFB software which are connected while stowed behind each pilot. Airbus says the cockpit design allows for future advances in navigation technology to be placed on the displays plus gives flexibility and capacity to upload new software and to combine data from multiple sources and sensors for flight management and aircraft systems control. An optional head-up display is also present in the cockpit.

Avionics are a further development of the integrated modular avionics (IMA) concept found on the A380. The A350&#x27;s IMA will manage up to 40 functions (versus 23 functions for the A380) such as undercarriage, fuel, pneumatics, cabin environmental systems, and fire detection. Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50% fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet standard, as employed in the A380, in place of the architecture used on the A330/A340.
===Engines===
In 2005, GE was the launch engine of the original A350, aiming for 2010 deliveries, while Rolls-Royce offered its Trent 1700.
For the updated A350 XWB, GE offered a GEnx-3A87 for the A350-800/900, but not a higher thrust version needed for the A350-1000, which competes with the longer range 777 powered exclusively with the GE90-115B.
In December 2006, Rolls-Royce was selected for the A350 XWB launch engine.

The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB features a diameter fan and the design is based on the advanced developments of the Airbus A380 Trent 900 and the Boeing 787 Trent 1000. It has four thrust levels to power the A350 variants: and for the regional variants of the A350-900 while the baseline A350-900 has the standard and for the A350-1000. The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module—it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new fan blade design—and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce&#x27;s research.

The Trent XWB may also benefit from the next-generation reduced acoustic mode scattering engine duct system (RAMSES), an acoustic quieting engine nacelle intake, and a carry-on design of the Airbus&#x27;s &quot;zero splice&quot; intake liner developed for the A380. A &quot;hot and high&quot; rating option for Middle Eastern customers Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways keep its thrust available at higher temperatures and altitudes.

Airbus aimed to certify the A350 with 350-minute ETOPS capability on entry into service; although Airbus achieved a 370-minute ETOPS rating on 15 October 2014, which covers 99.7% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. There are plans to extend this to 420 minutes in the future. Engine thrust-reversers and nacelles are supplied by US-based Collins Aerospace (formerly UTC Aerospace Systems).

==Operational history==
One year after introduction, the A350 fleet had accumulated 3,000 flight cycles and around 16,000 block hours. Average daily usage by first customers was 11.4 hours with flights averaging 5.2 hours, which are under the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities and reflect both short flights within the schedules of Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines, as well as flight-crew proficiency training that is typical of early use and is accomplished on short-haul flights. Finnair was operating the A350 at very high rates: 15 flight hours per day for Beijing, 18 hours for Shanghai, and more than 20 hours for Bangkok. This may have accelerated the retirement of the Airbus A340.

In service, problems occurred in three areas. The onboard maintenance, repair, overhaul network needed software improvements. Airbus issued service bulletins regarding onboard equipment and removed galley inserts (coffee makers, toaster ovens) because of leaks. Airbus had to address spurious overheating warnings in the bleed air system by retrofitting an original connector with a gold-plated connector. Airbus targeted a 98.5% dependability by the end of 2016 and to match the mature A330 reliability by early 2019.

By the end of May 2016, the A350 fleet had flown 55,200 hours over 9,400 cycles at a 97.8% operational reliability on three months. The longest operated sector was Qatar Airways&#x27; Adelaide–Doha at 13.8 hours for . 45% of flights were under , 16% over , and 39% in between. The average flight was 6.8 hours, with the longest average being 9.6 hours by TAM Airlines and the shortest being 2.1 hours by Cathay Pacific&#x27;s. It is able to seat from 253 seats for Singapore Airlines to 348 seats for TAM Airlines, with a 30 to 46 seat business class and a 211 to 318 seat economy class, often including a premium economy. A total of 49 A350s were delivered to customers in 2016. It was also planned that the monthly rate would grow to 10 by the end of 2018, which was eventually achieved in 2019 when Airbus delivered 112 aircraft over a period of 11 months.

In January 2017, two years after introduction, 62 aircraft were in service with 10 airlines. They had accumulated 25,000 flights over 154,000 hours with an average daily utilisation of 12.5 hours, and transported six million passengers with a 98.7% operational reliability. Zodiac Aerospace encountered production difficulties with business class seats in their Texas and California factories. After a year, Cathay Pacific experienced cosmetic quality issues and upgraded or replaced the seats for the earliest cabins.
In 2017, average test flights before delivery decreased to 4.1 from 12 in 2014, with an average delay down to 25 days from 68. Its reliability was 97.2% in 2015, 98.3% in 2016, and 98.8% in June 2017, just behind its 99% target for 2017.

In June 2017 after 30 months in commercial operation, 80 A350s were in service with 12 operators, the largest being Qatar Airways with 17 and 13 each at Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines (SIA). The fleet average block time (time between pushback and destination gate arrival) was 7.2 hours with 53% below , 16% over , and 31% in between. LATAM Airlines had the longest average sector at 10.7 hours, and Asiana had the shortest at 3.8 hours. Singapore Airlines operated the longest leg, Singapore to San Francisco , and the shortest leg, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur . Seating varied from 253 for Singapore Airlines to 389 for Air Caraïbes, with most between 280 and 320.

As of February 2018, 142 A350-900s had been delivered, and were in operation with a dispatch reliability of 99.3%. As of November 2019, 33 operators had received 331 aircraft from 959 orders, and 2.6 million hours have been flown.

On 30 September 2022, the 500th A350, an A350-900, was delivered to Iberia.
, the global A350 fleet of 620 aircraft had completed more than 1,589,000 flights on more than 1,240 routes, and had carried more than 400 million passengers since its entry into service; the fleet had 99.3% operational reliability in the last 3 months.

=== Qatar Airways paint dispute ===
In August 2021, as several A350s were sent in to be repainted in a scheme advertising the 2022 FIFA World Cup (played in Qatar), Qatar Airways discovered that their paint was unusually degraded. The airline grounded its A350s until the root cause could be determined, and would not accept new aircraft deliveries until the problem could be solved. The European civil aviation regulator, EASA, found that paint degradation did not affect the aircraft structure or introduce &quot;other risks&quot;. The Qatari civil aviation regulator was the only one that agreed with the airline that it was an airworthiness issue.

In November 2021, Reuters found that Finnair, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Lufthansa and Air France had also complained of paint damage as early as 2016. Singapore Airlines had not detected such problems with its fleet.

On 20 December 2021, Airbus received a formal legal claim in the English courts filed by Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways alleged that the surface flaws cause the risk of fuel tank ignition due to the degradation in lightning protection over the fuel tanks in the wings. Qatar Airways claimed it was owed per day in compensation for each grounded aircraft. Meanwhile, according to a Flight International editorial, Airbus&#x27;s decision to cancel Qatar&#x27;s outstanding orders indicated that it was certain of its case. The court hearing was originally scheduled for summer 2023.

Both Airbus and Qatar Airways agreed to settle the dispute on 1 February 2023. While the settlement was confidential, Flight International believed that Airbus achieved a more favourable outcome, opining that there was no major impact to Airbus&#x27;s finances, the A350&#x27;s reputation remained intact and Qatar&#x27;s A321neos would nevertheless be delivered.

==Variants==
The three main variants of the A350 were launched in 2006, with entry into service planned for 2013. At the 2011 Paris Air Show, Airbus postponed the entry into service of the A350-1000 by two years to mid-2017. In July 2012, the A350&#x27;s entry into service was delayed to the second half of 2014, before the -900 began service on 15 January 2015. In October 2012, the -800 was due to enter service in mid-2016, but its development was cancelled in September 2014 in favour of the reengined Airbus A330neo. The A350 is also offered as the ACJ350 corporate jet by Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), offering a range for 25 passengers for the -900 derivative.

===A350-900===
The A350-900 (ICAO code: A359) is the first A350 model; it has a MTOW of , typically seats 325 passengers, and has a range of . Airbus says that per seat, the Boeing 777-200ER should have a 16% heavier manufacturer&#x27;s empty weight, a 30% higher block fuel consumption, and 25% higher cash operating costs than the A350-900. The −900 is designed to compete with the Boeing 777-200LR and 787-10, while replacing the Airbus A340-500 and Boeing 777-200ER.

A proposed A350−900R extended-range variant was to feature the higher engine thrust, strengthened structure, and landing gear of the MTOW -1000 to give a further range.

Philippine Airlines (PAL) will replace its A340-300 with an A350-900HGW (&quot;high-gross weight&quot;) variant available from 2017. It will enable non-stop Manila-New York City flights without payload limitations in either direction, a flight. The PAL version will have a MTOW, and from 2020, the -900 will be proposed with the ULR&#x27;s MTOW, up from the for the original weight variant and the certified variants, with the large fuel capacity. This will enable an range with 325 seats in a three-class layout.

In early November 2017, Emirates committed to purchase 40 Boeing 787-10 aircraft before Airbus presented an updated A350-900 layout with the rear pressure bulkhead pushed back by . After Emirates&#x27; Tim Clark was shown a ten-across economy cabin and galley changes, he said the -900 is &quot;more marketable&quot; as a result.

The average lease rates of the first A350-900s produced in 2014 were $1.1 million per month, not including maintenance reserves amounting to $18 million after 10–12 years, and falling to $940,000 per month in 2018 while a new A350-900 is leased for $1.2 million per month and its interior can cost $12 million, 10% of the aircraft.
By 2018, a 2014 build was valued $108M falling to $74.5M by 2022 while a new build was valued for $148M, a 6+12year check cost $3M and an engine overhaul $4–6.5M.

====A350-900ULR====
Designated as weight variant 13 (WV013), the MTOW of the ultra-long range -900ULR has been increased to and its fuel capacity increased from within existing fuel tanks, enabling up to 19-hour flights with a range, the longest range of any airliner in service . The MTOW is increased by from the previously certified variant. Because of the A350-900&#x27;s fuel consumption of per hour, it needs an additional of fuel to fly 19 hours instead of the standard 15 hours: the increased MTOW and lower payloads will enable the larger fuel capacity. Non-stop flights could last more than 20 hours. The first −900ULR was rolled out without its engines in February 2018 for ground testing. Flight-tests after engine installation checked the larger fuel capacity and measured the performance improvements from the extended winglets. It made its first flight on 23 April 2018.

There are no addition structural changes fitted to the A350-900ULR, therefore it retains the same type certificate and model name as the baseline A350-941. The larger fuel capacity is enabled by integrating a modified fuel system to make use of the extra spaces in the centre wing box, no auxiliary fuel tanks are fitted. Also the front cargo hold is disabled due to operational limits but can be reactivated depending on customer needs.

Singapore Airlines, the launch customer and currently the only operator, uses its seven -900ULR aircraft on non-stop flights between Singapore and New York City and cities on the U.S. west coast. Singapore Airlines&#x27; seating is to range from 170 in largely business class seating up to over 250 in mixed seating. The planes can be reconfigured. They will have two seating classes. The airline received its first -900ULR on 23 September 2018, with 67 business class seats and 94 premium economy seats. On 12 October 2018, it landed the world&#x27;s then-longest flight at Newark Liberty International Airport from Singapore Changi after 17 hours and 52 minutes, covering for a orthodromic distance. It burned of fuel to cover the route in 17 h 22 min: an average of . As of 2022, the A350-900ULR is used on the longest flight in the world, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24 from Singapore to New York JFK.

At the 2015 Dubai Air Show, John Leahy noted the demand of the Persian Gulf airlines for this variant. In February 2018, Qatar Airways stated its preference for the larger -1000, having no need for the extra range of the -900ULR. Compared to the standard -900, the -900ULR additional value is likely around $2 million.

====ACJ350====
Airbus Corporate Jet version of the A350, the ACJ350, is derived from the A350-900ULR. As a result of the increased fuel capacity from the -900ULR, the ACJ350 has a maximum range of . The German Air Force is to be the first to receive the ACJ350, having ordered three aircraft which will replace its two A340-300s.

====A350-900 Regional====
After the Boeing 787-10 launch at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Airbus discussed with airlines a possible A350-900 Regional with a reduced MTOW of . Engine thrust would have been reduced to from the standard and the variant would have been optimised for routes up to with seating for up to 360 passengers in a single-class layout. The A350 Regional was expected to be ordered by Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines. Since 2013, there has been no further announcement about this variant.

Singapore Airlines selected an A350-900 version for medium-haul use, and Japan Airlines took delivery of a 369-seat A350-900 with a MTOW (WV018) for its domestic flight network. The A350 Type Certificate Data Sheet includes MTOWs of 210, 217, 235, 240, 250, 255, 260, 268, 272, 275, 277, 278, 280 and 283 t.

===A350-1000===
The A350-1000 (ICAO code: A35K) is the largest variant of the A350 family at just under in length. It seats 350–410 passengers in a typical three-class layout with a range of . With a 9-across configuration, it is designed to replace the A340-600 and compete with the Boeing 777-300ER and 777-8. Airbus estimates a 366-seat -1000 should have a lighter operating empty weight than a 398-seat 777-9, a 15% lower trip cost, a 7% lower seat cost, and a greater range. Compared to a Boeing 777-300ER with 360 seats, Airbus claims a 25% fuel burn per seat advantage for an A350-1000 with 369 seats. The extension seats 40 more passengers with 40% more premium area. The -1000 can match the 40 more seats of the 777-9 with a 10-across seating configuration but diminished comfort.

The A350-1000 has an 11-frame stretch over the −900 and a slightly larger wing than the −800/900 models with trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%. This will extend the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around , optimising flap lift performance as well as cruise performance. The main landing gear is a 6-wheel bogie instead of a 4-wheel bogie, put in a one frame longer bay. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine&#x27;s thrust is augmented to . These and other engineering upgrades are necessary so that the −1000 model maintains range.
It features an automatic emergency descent function to around and notifies air traffic control if the crew fails to respond to an alert, indicating possible incapacitation from depressurisation. The avionics software adaptation is activated by a push and pull button to avoid mistakes and could be retrofitted in the smaller -900. All performance targets have been met or exceeded, and it remains within its weight specification, unlike early −900s.

Its basic MTOW was increased to before offering a possible version. Its 316 t MTOW appeared on 29 May 2018 update of its type certificate data sheet. This raised its range from . A further MTOW increase by , to a total of is under study to be available from 2020 and could be a response to Qantas&#x27; Project Sunrise.

In November 2019, maximum accommodation increased to 480 seats from 440 through the installation of new &quot;Type-A+&quot; exits, with a dual-lane evacuation slide. On 17 December 2021, French Bee took delivery of the first A350-1000 in this 480-seat configuration, leased by Air Lease Corporation and to be operated by from Paris to Reunion Island, with 40 premium and 440 economy seats.

In October 2023, the variant&#x27;s MTOW was raised again to .

==== Qantas Project Sunrise ====

In December 2019, Qantas tentatively chose the A350-1000 to operate their Project Sunrise routes, before a final decision in March 2020 for up to 12 aircraft. Initial speculation suggested that the variant might be marketed as the A350-1000ULR. However, the -1000 is not expected to share the -900ULR&#x27;s larger fuel tanks and other fuel system modifications, and Airbus has stopped short of describing the largest MTOW variant as a ULR model, despite the range. After a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision was confirmed on 2 May 2022, when Qantas placed a formal order for 12 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft for Project Sunrise flights to originally start in 2025.

On 6 June 2024, Qantas International CEO Cam Wallace, confirmed at the 80th International Air Transport Authority (IATA) AGM in Dubai, that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had approved the design of the rear centre tank (RCT) that allowed the aircraft to fly the distances required, following a requested redesign. With Airbus integrating the tank into the A350-1000 for flight testing in early 2025 for delivery to the group in mid-2026. The aircraft will be configured with 238 seats in four classes, with Qantas publications and website using the ULR abbreviation, but Airbus is yet to confirm.

===A350F===
An A350-900 freighter was first mentioned in 2007, offering a similar capacity to the MD-11F with a range of 9,250 km (5,000 nmi; ), to be developed after the passenger version. In early 2020, Airbus was proposing an A350F before a potential launch. The proposed freighter would be slightly longer than the A350-900 and Airbus would need 50 orders to launch the $2–3 billion programme.
In July 2021, the Airbus board approved the freighter development. It is based on the -1000 version for a payload over 90 tonnes, and entry into service is targeted for 2025.

The A350F, also referred to by Airbus as the A350-1000F, would keep the 319-tonne MTOW previously announced for the passenger A350-1000 on a shortened fuselage, but the proposed design remains longer than the Boeing 777F with 10% larger freight volume at . With a main deck cargo door behind the wing and reinforced main deck aluminium floor beams, its payload is higher than the of the 777F, while its empty weight is lighter than the A350-1000, lighter than the 777F.
The 70.8 m (232 ft) long cargo variant should have a range at max payload.
At the November 2021 Dubai Air Show, US lessor Air Lease Corporation became the launch customer with an order for seven to be delivered around 2026, among other Airbus airliners. The launch operator of the A350F will be Singapore Airlines, who ordered 7 aircraft at the 2022 Singapore Airshow, with deliveries expected to begin in 2026. In February 2025, Airbus announced that entry-into-service would be delayed until 2027 due to supply chain issues, particularly with Spirit Aerosystems which supplies the central fuselage section.

==Operators==


There are 643 A350 aircraft in service with 38 operators and 60 customers . The five largest operators were Singapore Airlines (65), Qatar Airways (58), Cathay Pacific (48), Air France (35) and Delta Air Lines (35).

===Orders and deliveries===

== Accidents and incidents ==

The global fleet of A350s has been involved in one airport-safety related hull-loss accident . Although there were no fatalities onboard the A350, there were five fatalities onboard another aircraft on the ground.

* On 2 January 2024 Japan Airlines Flight 516, an A350-900 flying from New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido to Haneda Airport in Tokyo, collided after touchdown with a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 operated by the Japan Coast Guard. The A350 caught fire and was completely destroyed, though all 367 passengers and 12 crew members successfully evacuated from the aircraft via the emergency slides, with 17 injuries reported. Five of the six crew members aboard the Coast Guard aircraft were killed; the sole survivor was the captain, who suffered serious injuries. The Japan Coast Guard aircraft was delivering supplies as part of relief efforts following the Noto earthquake the previous day. Flight 516 had been cleared to land by Haneda ATC when it struck the coast guard plane.

<doc id="1006467" wikidata="Q49632" url="?curid=1006467" title="Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea">
<text>The Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK), also known as the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF) or the Fatherland Front, was a North Korean united front formed on 25 June 1949 and led by the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK). It was initially called the Fatherland United Democratic Front.

The front initially consisted of 72 parties and social organizations from both the North and the South; at the time of its dissolution, it had 24 members. The three legal political parties of North Korea—the WPK, the Korean Social Democratic Party, and the Chondoist Chongu Party—all participated in the front. The country&#x27;s four most important mass organizations—the Socialist Patriotic Youth League, Socialist Women&#x27;s Union of Korea, General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea—were member organizations. The Korean Children&#x27;s Union was also a member organization.

All candidates for an elected office in North Korea had to be a member of the front, and were nominated and approved at mass meetings held by the front. The WPK led the front and all other member organizations were subservient to it. The WPK was thus able to predetermine the composition of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly (SPA). The Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front is ostensibly the South Korean counterpart to the DFRK, but it operates from North Korea.

==History==

The National Democratic Front (), a South Korean leftist organization, was founded with the Communist Party of Korea as its leading organization on 15 February 1946. It was formed from 40 leftist parties and consisted of 398 communists led by Lyuh Woon-hyung, Pak Hon-yong, and Ho Hon. The North Korean National Democratic Front () was founded on 22 July 1946. It was formed from 13 parties and organizations and led by Kim Il Sung, Kim Tu-bong, and Choe Yong-gon. It included the North Korean Branch of the Communist Party and the New People’s Party of Korea, which were soon merged to form the Workers&#x27; Party of North Korea, as well as the Korean Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party. The North Korean National Democratic Front absorbed the South Korean National Democratic Front on 25 June 1949, after South Korea outlawed the latter, leading to the establishment of the Fatherland United Democratic Front.

In the 1950s, the front outlived its original role as a way for the Workers&#x27; Party to consolidate its power. It was therefore assigned a new role; to serve as body to interact with South Korean organizations and political parties. It consequently changed the English rendering name to the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK). According to North Korea expert Andrei Lankov, in this capacity, the DFRK &quot;handled relations with South Korea’s assorted progressive groups while also serving as a quasi-official voice of the North Korean government on matters related to the South&quot;.

In 2018, the DFRK was led by Pak Myong Chol. Presidium members during that time included Ri Kil Song and Kim Wan Su. On 23 March 2024, the Korean Central News Agency reported that the DFRK had officially dissolved its central committee, effectively dissolving the whole front. The move followed a speech by Kim Jong Un in which he stated that the North would give up its goal of peaceful reunification with the South and dissolve all organizations related to the goal. At the time of its dissolution, the Director of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the DFRK was Maeng Kyong Il. Members of the Presidium of the Central Committee included Pak Myong Chol and Kim Wan Su.

<doc id="1006468" wikidata="Q300501" url="?curid=1006468" title="A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)">
<text>A Night at the Opera is the seventh studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, released in 2002. It is named after the 1975 Queen album of the same name, which is itself named after the Marx brothers film of the same name.

This album continues a stylistic change from power metal into a more progressive sound, with multiple overlaid vocals, choirs, orchestral keys and guitar leads and less emphasis on powerful guitar riffs and heavy rhythms. As a result, drummer Thomen Stauch would leave the group, citing dissatisfaction with the direction the group was going in.

== Track listing ==


== Lyrical references ==
The album features the concepts and themes familiar to Blind Guardian fans, such as historical battles and religious references.

* &quot;Precious Jerusalem&quot; is based on the final days of Jesus of Nazareth and his temptation in the desert.
* &quot;Battlefield&quot; is based on &quot;Song of Hildebrandt&quot;, an old German tale of a father and son who find themselves in a duel to the death.
* &quot;Under the Ice&quot; has connections to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, focuses on Cassandra and what happened to her after the Trojan War, particularly from &quot;The Oresteia&quot;.
* &quot;Sadly Sings Destiny&quot; is based on the religious aspect of the Messiah in the Old Testament, and tells of the crucifixion of Jesus from the point of view of a character who reluctantly helps fulfil the prophecy, by doing such things as building the True Cross and weaving the Crown of Thorns.
* &quot;The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight&quot; is based on an episode from the story of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.
* &quot;Wait for an Answer&quot; allegorically concerns the Nazi propaganda machine.
* &quot;The Soulforged&quot; is based on the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; saga&#x27;s tales of the mage Raistlin Majere.
* &quot;Age of False Innocence&quot; is about Galileo Galilei.
* &quot;Punishment Divine&quot; is about Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s decline into insanity where he imagines himself being judged by a court of saints.
* &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot; is about Cassandra&#x27;s visions of the coming Trojan War. It was inspired by Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.
* &quot;Harvest of Sorrow&quot; is based on Tolkien&#x27;s tragic story of Túrin Turambar, which appears in the &quot;Silmarillion&quot;.

<text>Menai is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 29 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire.

==History==
Menai is named after Menai Bridge, a town on the Menai Strait in Wales.

The area now known as Menai was originally called Bangor in 1895 by the land&#x27;s owner, a farmer named Owen Jones, after his birthplace Bangor in Wales. To avoid confusion with Bangor in Tasmania, the Postmaster General&#x27;s Office changed the suburb name to Menai in 1910. Menai Bridge in Wales lies opposite Bangor on the Menai Strait. When Menai expanded, the eastern section became Bangor again.

The suburb has been affected by bushfires on several occasions, including the 1994 Eastern seaboard fires and 2017–18 Australian bushfire season.

==Population==
According to the of Population, there were 10,419 people in Menai.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.3% of the population. 
* 78.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 2.5%, China 1.4%, South Africa 1.2%, New Zealand 1.1% and North Macedonia 0.9%.
* 80.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 2.5%, Arabic 2.0%, Mandarin 1.8%, Macedonian 1.8% and Cantonese 1.1%.
* The most common responses for religion were Catholic 30.7%, No Religion 25.0%, Anglican 16.5% and Eastern Orthodox 7.4%.

==Housing==
Menai is a newer suburb, having been developed only since the early 1980s, and as such, nearly all the homes are new 4-bedders with dual bathrooms and double-garages and mostly owner occupied. In fact, the region has one of the highest rates of home ownership in Australia, at over 81%.

==Schools==
Menai&#x27;s schools include Menai Primary [K-6], Aquinas College [Catholic, 7-12] and Holy Family Primary School [Catholic, K-6]. Menai High School [7-12] is not in Menai, but just outside in Illawong.

==Sports and Recreation==
The Menai Hawks FC are the local representative football club competing in the Sutherland Shire Football Association.

<text>Helen Ricker Beebe (May 16, 1900 – July 31, 1984) was an American romance novelist who published under the name Elswyth Thane. 

==Early life and writing career==
Born in Burlington, Iowa, she was the daughter of a local teacher and high school principal. The family moved to New York City in 1918, and &quot;Helen Ricker&quot; changed her name to &quot;Elswyth Thane&quot;. She began working as a freelance writer in the 1920s, and became a newspaper writer and a Hollywood screenwriter. Her first novel, &quot;Riders of the Wind&quot;, was published in 1926. Her novel, &quot;The Tudor Wench&quot;, about Elizabeth I of England, was made into a play.

Thane is most famous for her &quot;Williamsburg&quot; series of historical fiction. The books cover several generations of two families from the American Revolutionary War up to World War II. In later books, the action moves from Williamsburg to New York City, Richmond, Virginia and England.

==Personal life==
On September 22, 1927, at 27 years old she married 50-year-old naturalist and explorer William Beebe; it was his second marriage. Beebe died in 1962, leaving half of his estate to his widow. She lived on the couple&#x27;s farm in Wilmington, Vermont. Her last work, &quot;Fighting Quaker: Nathaniel Greene&quot;, was published in 1972. When she died, she left her papers to the University of Iowa.

<text>Live Seeds is the first official live album by Australian post-punk band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The album was recorded live from 1992 to 1993 during various concerts throughout Europe and Australia in support of their 1992 studio album &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Frontman Nick Cave wanted to give the songs a raw feeling as originally intended before production problems occurred. &quot;Live Seeds&quot; includes a not previously studio-recorded track, &quot;Plain Gold Ring&quot;, which is a cover of a song performed by Nina Simone.

==Background==
&quot;Live Seeds&quot; was a live album recorded from 1992 to 1993 by Australian post-punk band, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds at various concerts throughout Europe and Australia. The band had formed in 1983 with a line-up including Nick Cave on lead vocals, Mick Harvey (initially on drums) on guitar, Blixa Bargeld on guitar and Barry Adamson on bass guitar. Soon after the release and subsequent tour for 1988&#x27;s &quot;Tender Prey&quot;, Cave began experimenting with piano-driven ballads, resulting in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Good Son&quot;. Seeped in sorrow and longing, the comparatively refined and understated album was well-received critically and commercially, yielding the singles &quot;The Weeping Song&quot; and &quot;The Ship Song&quot;.

In 1990, two Australian musicians joined, Martyn Casey (The Triffids) on bass guitar and Conway Savage on keyboards. Their next album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot;, marked a step back to harder rock, utilising producer David Briggs (Neil Young). The album&#x27;s tour is documented on &quot;Live Seeds&quot; and showcases the new group&#x27;s aggressive yet accomplished sound. The live album was produced by the band. Sound engineer and mixer Tony Cohen said that the lead vocals were overdubbed &#x27;live&#x27; in the studio in Melbourne before the album was mixed. He said, &quot;I let the tape roll and Nick sang from start to finish. To his credit, he didn&#x27;t stop. It was as though he was on stage. Mentally he was. He sang exactly like he would live. Except not as out of breath, or badly out of tune.&quot;

In mid-1993, Cave relocated to London where &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot;″s follow-up studio album, &quot;Let Love In&quot;, was recorded and released in 1994.

==Reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett review of &quot;Live Seeds&quot; noted that &quot;some fans consider many of the songs on [this album] to be superior to their studio equivalent – a testament to its overall quality&quot;. He felt that &quot;few cuts differ drastically from the more familiar album versions, but generally everything is crisper, at times much more brusque, perhaps exchanging texture for force&quot;.

<doc id="1006487" wikidata="Q161395" url="?curid=1006487" title="Party of Labour of Albania">
<text>The Party of Labour of Albania (PLA), also referred to as the Albanian Workers&#x27; Party (AWP), was the ruling and sole legal party of Albania during the communist period (1945–1991). It was founded on 8 November 1941 as the Communist Party of Albania (, PKSh) but changed its name in 1948 following a recommendation by Joseph Stalin. The party was dissolved on 13 June 1991 and succeeded by the Socialist Party of Albania and the new Communist Party of Albania. For most of its existence, the party was dominated by its First Secretary, Enver Hoxha, who was also the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985.

==Background==
In the 1920s, Albania was the only Balkan country without a communist party. The first Albanian communists emerged from the followers of Albanian clergyman and politician Fan S. Noli. Once in Moscow, they formed the National Revolutionary Committee and became affiliated to the Comintern. In August 1928, the first Albanian Communist Party was formed in the Soviet Union. The most prominent figure of the party was Ali Kelmendi who left Albania in 1936, to fight in the Spanish Civil War. He was later regarded as the leader of a small group of Albanian Communists in France. However, no unified organisation existed in Albania until 1941.

==History==
===World War II===
Following the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito under Comintern directives sent two Yugoslav delegates Miladin Popović and Dušan Mugoša to Albania. These two helped unite the Albanian communist groups in 1941. After intensive work, the Albanian Communist Party was formed on 8 November 1941 by a delegates from Shkodër with Enver Hoxha from the Korça branch as its leader. 

The PKSh was the dominant element of the National Liberation Movement (LNC), formed in 1942. The LNC drove out the German occupiers (who had taken over from the Italians in 1943) on 29 November 1944. From that day onward, Albania was a full-fledged Communist regime. In every other Eastern European country, the Communists were at least nominally part of a coalition government for a few years before seizing power at the helm of out-and-out Communist regimes. King Zog was barred from ever returning to Albania, though the monarchy was not formally abolished until January 1946.

In the elections for the Constituent Assembly held on 2 December 1945, voters were presented with a single list from the Democratic Front, organised and led by the PKSh. The Front received 93.7% of the vote.

===Hoxha era (1945–1985)===
In a meeting with Joseph Stalin in July 1947 Stalin suggested the party be renamed to the &quot;Party of Labour of Albania&quot; because peasants were a majority in the country. Hoxha accepted this suggestion. During the period from 1947 to 1953, relations between the Party of Labour of Albania and the Soviet Union were close, as Hoxha steered the party towards a firm Stalinist line. For their part, the Soviets gave significant technological and economical aid to Albania, and also stationed military forces on the Adriatic sea with Hoxha&#x27;s blessing.

However, following Stalin&#x27;s death, the party became the most rigidly anti-revisionist party in the Soviet Bloc. In 1961, Hoxha broke with Moscow over Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s supposed deviations from fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, though relations between Tirana and Moscow had begun to chill as early as 1955. During this time, pro-Moscow elements of the party were purged, including Liri Belishova and Koço Tashko. Having once again eliminated his rivals, Hoxha opted instead to align his party with the People&#x27;s Republic of China under Mao Zedong. In 1968, Albania formally withdrew from the Warsaw Pact. The party even went as far as to engineer an Albanian version of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution.

After Mao&#x27;s death, the PKSh felt increasing chagrin as Mao&#x27;s successors moved away from his legacy. In 1978, Hoxha declared that Albania would blaze its own trail to a socialist society.

Hoxha led the party and state more or less without resistance until his death in 1985.

===Post-Hoxha (1985–1991)===
Hoxha&#x27;s successor, Ramiz Alia, was forced to initiate gradual reforms in order to stop the country&#x27;s economic downspiral. However, in late 1989, various elements of society began to speak out against the restrictions still in place. The execution of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu led Alia to fear he would be next. In response, he allowed Albanians to travel abroad, ended the regime&#x27;s longstanding policy of state atheism, and slightly loosened government control of the economy. However, these measures only served to buy Alia more time. Finally, bowing to the inevitable, on 11 December 1990, Alia announced that the PPSh had abandoned power and legalised opposition parties. The PPSh won the Constitutional Assembly elections of 1991. However, by then it was no longer a Marxist-Leninist party, and was powerless to prevent the adoption of a new interim constitution that formally stripped it of its monopoly of power.

In 1991, the PPSh dissolved and refounded itself as the social-democratic Socialist Party of Albania, which is now one of the two major political parties in Albania. A group called &quot;Volunteers of Enver&quot;, led by Hysni Milloshi, laid claim to the identity of the PPSh as the Communist Party of Albania.

==Structure==
The ideology of the PPSh was an anti-revisionist variant of Marxism–Leninism known as Hoxhaism. The party organisation was built up following democratic centralist principles, with Hoxha as its First Secretary. Article 3 of Albania&#x27;s 1976 Constitution identified the Party as the &quot;leading political force of the state and of the society.&quot; To help carry out its ideological activities it had an associated mass organization known as the Democratic Front. Its daily publication was (Voice of the People) and its monthly theoretical journal was (Road of the Party).

The highest organ of the Party, according to the Party statutes, was the Party Congress, which met for a few days every five years. Delegates to the Congress were elected at conferences held at the regional, district, and city levels. The Congress examined and approved reports submitted by the Central Committee, discussed general Party policies, and elected the Central Committee. The latter was the next-highest level in the Party hierarchy and generally included all key officials in the government, as well as prominent members of the Sigurimi. The Central Committee directed Party activities between Party Congresses and met approximately three times a year.

As in the Soviet Union, the Central Committee elected a Politburo and a . The Politburo, which usually included key government ministers and Central Committee secretaries, was the main administrative and policy-making body and convened on a weekly basis. Generally, the Central Committee approved Politburo reports and policy decisions. The Secretariat was responsible for guiding the day-to-day affairs of the Party, in particular for organising the execution of Politburo decisions and for selecting Party and government cadres.

==External following==
The staunchly orthodox stand of the PPSh attracted many political groupings around the world, particularly among Maoists who were not content with the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s attitude in the late 1970s. A large number of parties declared themselves to be in the &quot;PPSh line&quot;, especially during the period 1978–1980. However, many of them abandoned this certain affiliation after the fall of the socialist government in Albania. Today, many of the political parties upholding the political line of the PPSh are grouped around the International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organisations.

The following parties were followers of the PPSh during the Cold War:
*Communist Party of Denmark/Marxist–Leninists
*Workers&#x27; Communist Party of France
*Communist Party of Germany/Marxists–Leninists
*Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist)
*Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist)
*Communist Movement M-L (Iceland)
*Communist Party of Ireland (Marxist–Leninist)
*Communist Party of Italy (Marxist–Leninist)
*Portuguese Communist Party (Reconstructed)
*Communist Party of Spain (Marxist–Leninist) (historical)
*Communist Party Marxists-Leninists (revolutionaries) (Sweden)
*Communist Party of Benin
*Voltaic Revolutionary Communist Party
*Union for People&#x27;s Democracy (Senegal)
*Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist)
*Marxist–Leninist Popular Action Movement (Nicaragua)
*Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago
*Communist Party of Brazil
*Peruvian Communist Party – Red Flag
*Revolutionary Vanguard (Communist Proletarian) (Peru)
*Communist Party of Suriname

<text>The Open Polar Sea was a conjectured ice-free body of water that was believed to encircle the North Pole. Although this theory was widely accepted and served as a basis for many exploratory expeditions aimed at reaching the North Pole by sea or discovering a navigable route between Europe and the Pacific via the North Pole, it was ultimately proven to be untrue.

However, global warming could open large areas of the Arctic Ocean by the end of the 21st century.

==History==
The theory that the North Pole region might be a practical sea route goes back to at least the 16th century, when it was suggested by English cartographer Robert Thorne (1492-1532). The explorers William Barents and Henry Hudson also believed in the Open Polar Sea. For a time, the theory was put aside because of the practical experience of navigators who encountered impenetrable ice as they went north.

However, the idea was revived again in the mid-19th century by theoretical geographers, such as Matthew F. Maury and August Petermann. At the time, interest in polar exploration was high because of the search for John Franklin&#x27;s missing expedition, and many would-be polar explorers took up the theory, including Elisha Kent Kane, Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes, and George Washington De Long.

It was believed that once a ship broke through the regions of thick ice that had stopped previous explorers, a temperate sea would be found beyond it.

==Support==
Although it is now known that the North Pole was covered with thick ice for much of the period, the Open Polar Sea was a popular theory in the 16th to the 19th centuries, and many arguments were made to justify its existence:

* Since sea ice was erroneously believed to form only near land, if there were no land near the North Pole, there would be no ice.
* Since there is perpetual sun during the Arctic summer, it would melt all the ice.
* Russian explorers had found large polynyas (areas of open water) north of Svalbard and so there were surely other areas of open water elsewhere.
* Maury, Petermann, and other scientists who studied ocean currents in the 19th century hypothesized that warm northward currents such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current must rise to the surface and result in an ice-free sea near the pole.
* Extrapolation of temperature readings taken in subpolar regions indicated that the region of greatest cold would be at about 80°N, instead of at the North Pole.
* Migration patterns of certain animals seemed to suggest that the polar region was a hospitable place for them to live.

==Disproof and re-emergence==

The Open Polar Sea was debunked gradually by the failure of the expeditions in the 1810s to the 1880s to navigate the polar sea. Reports of open water by earlier explorers, such as Elisha Kent Kane and Isaac Israel Hayes, fueled optimism in the theory in the 1850s and 1860s. Support faded when George W. De Long sailed into the Bering Strait in the hope of finding an open gateway to the North Pole and was met by a sea of ice. After a long drift, pack ice crushed the &quot;Jeannette&quot;, and her survivors returned home with first hand accounts of an ice-covered polar sea. Other explorers such as British explorer George Nares confirmed it.

When Fridtjof Nansen and Otto Sverdrup drifted through the polar ice pack in &quot;Fram&quot; in 1893 to 1895, the Open Polar Sea was a defunct theory.

Nevertheless, scientific studies of global warming in the 2000s project that by the end of the 21st century, the annual summer withdrawal of the polar ice cap could expose large areas of the Arctic Ocean as open water, and an ice-free Arctic is possible in the future because of Arctic shrinkage. Although the North Pole itself could potentially remain ice-covered in winter, a navigable seasonal sea passage from Europe to the Pacific could develop along the north coast of Asia.

<doc id="1006501" wikidata="Q190122" url="?curid=1006501" title="Promissory note">
<text>A promissory note, sometimes referred to as a note payable, is a legal instrument (more particularly, a financing instrument and a debt instrument), in which one party (the &quot;maker&quot; or &quot;issuer&quot;) promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of money to the other (the &quot;payee&quot;), subject to any terms and conditions specified within the document.

==Overview==
The terms of a note typically include the principal amount, the interest rate if any, the parties, the date, the terms of repayment (which could include interest) and the maturity date. Sometimes, provisions are included concerning the payee&#x27;s rights in the event of a default, which may include foreclosure of the maker&#x27;s assets. In foreclosures and contract breaches, promissory notes under CPLR 5001 allow creditors to recover prejudgement interest from the date interest is due until liability is established. For loans between individuals, writing and signing a promissory note are often instrumental for tax and record keeping. A promissory note alone is typically unsecured.

===Terminology===
The term note payable is commonly used in accounting (as distinguished from accounts payable) or commonly as just a &quot;note&quot;, it is internationally defined by the &quot;Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes&quot;, but regional variations exist. A banknote is frequently referred to as a promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. Mortgage notes are another prominent example.

Promissory note is said to be negotiable instrument when it contains an unconditional promise.

Demand promissory notes are notes that do not carry a specific maturity date, but are due on demand of the lender. Usually the lender will only give the borrower a few days&#x27; notice before the payment is due.

Promissory notes may be used in combination with security agreements. For example, a promissory note may be used in combination with a mortgage, in which case it is called a mortgage note.

====Loan contracts====
In common speech, other terms, such as &quot;loan&quot;, &quot;loan agreement&quot;, and &quot;loan contract&quot; may be used interchangeably with &quot;promissory note&quot;. The term &quot;loan contract&quot; is often used to describe a contract that is lengthy and detailed.

A promissory note is very similar to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a promissory note is generally less detailed and less rigid than a loan contract. For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not.

====Difference from IOU====
Promissory notes differ from IOUs in that they contain a specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails. IOUs only acknowledge that a debt exists.

===Negotiability===
Negotiable instruments are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable instruments are subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the application of the holder in due course rule. The negotiability of mortgage notes has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and &quot;baggage&quot; associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.

In the United States, the Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note is not required.

===Use as financial instruments===
Promissory notes are a common financial instrument in many jurisdictions, employed as commercial paper principally for the short time financing of companies. Often, the seller or provider of a service is not paid upfront by the buyer (usually, another company), but within a period of time, the length of which has been agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. The reasons for this may vary; historically, many companies used to balance their books and execute payments and debts at the end of each week or tax month; any product bought before that time would be paid only then. Depending on the jurisdiction, this deferred payment period can be regulated by law; in countries like France, Italy or Spain, it usually ranges between 30 and 90 days after the purchase.

When a company engages in many of such transactions, for instance by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, it is possible that the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short-term loan, or using any other such short-term financial arrangements to avoid insolvency. However, in jurisdictions where promissory notes are commonplace, the company (called the &quot;payee&quot; or &quot;lender&quot;) can ask one of its debtors (called the &quot;maker&quot;, &quot;borrower&quot; or &quot;payor&quot;) to &quot;accept&quot; a promissory note, whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the promissory note (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time. The lender can then take the promissory note to a financial institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the promissory note for cash; usually, the promissory note is cashed in for the amount established in the promissory note, less a small discount.

Once the promissory note reaches its &quot;maturity date&quot;, its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount &quot;promised&quot; in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the promissory note in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured promissory notes, the lender accepts the promissory note based solely on the maker&#x27;s ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured promissory note, the lender accepts the promissory note based on the maker&#x27;s ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.

===Use as private money===
Thus, promissory notes can work as a form of private money. In the past, particularly during the 19th century, their widespread and unregulated use was a source of great risk for banks and private financiers, who would often face the insolvency of both debtors, or simply be scammed by both.

==History==

Code of Hammurabi Law 100 stipulated repayment of a loan by a debtor to a creditor on a schedule with a maturity date specified in written contractual terms. Law 122 stipulated that a depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of the contract. Law 124 stipulated that a depositor with a notarized contract of bailment was entitled to redeem the entire value of their deposit, and Law 125 stipulated that a banker was liable for replacement of deposits stolen while in their possession.
In China during the Han dynasty promissory notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather. The Romans may have used promissory notes in 57 AD as a durable lightweight substance as evidence of a promise in that time has been found in London among the Bloomberg tablets.

Carthage was purported to have issued lightweight promissory notes on parchment or leather before 146 BC. In China during the Han dynasty promissory notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather. The Romans may have used promissory notes in 57 AD as a durable lightweight substance as evidence of a promise in that time has been found in London among the Bloomberg tablets.

Historically, promissory notes have acted as a form of privately issued currency. Flying cash or &quot;feiqian&quot; was a promissory note used during the Tang dynasty (618 – 907). Flying cash was regularly used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals. The Chinese concept of promissory notes was introduced by Marco Polo to Europe.

According to tradition, in 1325 a promissory note was signed in Milan. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver. Around 1150 the Knights Templar issued promissory notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.

Around 1348 in Görlitz, Germany, the Jewish creditor Adasse owned a promissory note for 71 marks. There is also evidence of promissory notes being issued in 1384 between Genoa and Barcelona, although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d&#x27;Entença, a merchant from Huesca (then part of the Crown of Aragon), amounting a total of 100 florins. In all these cases, the promissory notes were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi issued an early form of promissory note in Medina del Campo (Spain), against the city of Besançon in 1553. However, there exists notice of promissory notes being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.

In 2005, the Korean Ministry of Justice and a consortium of financial institutions announced the service of an electronic promissory note (eNote) service, after years of development, allowing entities to make promissory notes (notes payable) in business transactions digitally instead of on paper, for the first time in the world.

In the United States, eNotes were made possible as a result of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act in 2000 and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). An eNote must meet all the requirements to be a written promissory note.

===International law===
In 1930, under the League of Nations, a &quot;Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes&quot; was drafted and ratified by eighteen nations. Article 75 of the treaty stated that a promissory note shall contain:
* the term &quot;promissory note&quot; inserted in the body of the instrument and expressed in the language employed in drawing up the instrument
* an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money;
* a statement of the time of payment;
* a statement of the place where payment is to be made;
* the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be made;
* a statement of the date and of the place where the promissory note is issued;
* the signature of the person who issues the instrument (maker).

==Worldwide==
===England and Wales===
===United States===

In the United States, a promissory note that meets certain conditions is a negotiable instrument regulated by article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Negotiable promissory notes called mortgage notes are used extensively in combination with mortgages in the financing of real estate transactions. One prominent example is the Fannie Mae model standard form contract Multistate Fixed-Rate Note 3200, which is publicly available. Promissory notes, or commercial papers, are also issued to provide capital to businesses. However, promissory notes act as a source of finance to the company&#x27;s creditors.

The various State law enactments of the Uniform Commercial Code define what is and what is not a promissory note, in section 3-104(d):

Thus, a writing containing such a disclaimer removes such a writing from the definition of &quot;negotiable instrument&quot;, instead simply memorializing a contract.

<text>Stephen Bishop ( – 1857) was an American cave explorer and self-taught geologist known for being one of the first people to explore and map Mammoth Cave in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Mammoth Cave is regarded as the longest cave system in the world and Bishop&#x27;s map of the cave, hand-drawn from memory off-site in 1842, was included in a book published in 1844. It was regarded as the authoritative map of the cave system for over four decades. Bishop was enslaved and worked as a guide at Mammoth for approximately 19 years. He was freed by manumission the year before his death.

==Background==
Bishop was brought to Mammoth Cave in 1838 when he was 17 years old, by lawyer and enslaver Franklin Gorin, who had acquired ownership of Bishop as repayment for a debt stemming from the divorce of Bishop&#x27;s possible father, white farmer Lowry Bishop. Gorin had purchased Mammoth Cave from its previous owners in the spring of 1838 for $5000 (~$ in ). Gorin wrote as he reminisced after Bishop&#x27;s death:

I placed a guide in the cave – the &quot;celebrated&quot; and &quot;great&quot; Stephen, and he aided in making the discoveries. Stephen was a self-educated man; a fine genius, a great fund of wit &amp; humor, some little knowledge of Latin and Greek, and much knowledge of geology, but his great talent was a perfect knowledge of man.

==Mammoth Cave career==
Bishop explored and named large areas of the Mammoth Cave system. He discovered and named many features of the Cave – including River Styx, Great Relief Hall, Fat Man&#x27;s Misery, Tall Man&#x27;s Misery, and Lake Lethe. Numerous authors wrote about their Mammoth Cave tours with Bishop as their guide in books and magazines. Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, writing in The Knickerbocker, as &quot;Barnwell&quot; refers to Bishop as &quot;Stephen, the best guide to the cave&quot;. Roosevelt states that Bishop told the group that he, Bishop, had learned to read and write by seeing previous tourists &quot;...the gentlemen paint their names with the smoke of the torches on the walls, and then asking how they spelled them.&quot; Later, in 1854, Nathaniel Parker Willis, in &quot;A Health Trip to the Tropics&quot;, described Bishop as wearing &quot;a chocolate-colored slouch hat, a green jacket, and striped trousers&quot; as his working uniform.

Willis also described Bishop as &quot;better worth looking at than most celebrities...With more of the physiognomy of a Spaniard, with masses of black hair, curling slightly and gracefully, and his long mustache, giving quite an appearance. He is of middle size, but built for an athlete. With broad chest and shoulders, narrow hips and legs slightly bowed. Mammoth Cave is a wonder in which draws good society and Stephen shows that he is used to it.&quot; Bishop led tours through Mammoth that included such well-known 19th century figures as opera-singer Jenny Lind, essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, Yale professor Benjamin Silliman Jr., and the violin virtuoso Ole Bull. 

Before Bishop, the farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the feature known as &quot;The Bottomless Pit&quot;. Along with a guest named H.C. Stevenson, (who allegedly offered Bishop a &quot;fistful of money&quot; to explore the unknown parts of the Cave) Bishop journeyed to the edge of the Pit. Though later tales said it was a cedar sapling, more reliable sources state it was a tall ladder or series of ladders laid across the mouth of the Pit that enabled Bishop and his guest to venture across to the other side, opening up a whole new part of the cave. Bishop is also said to have discovered eyeless fish, probably specimens of &quot;Amblyopsis spelaea&quot; or the Northern cavefish.

==Bishop&#x27;s 1842 map of Mammoth Cave== 
In 1839, Dr. John Croghan of Louisville bought the Mammoth Cave Estate from its owner Franklin Gorin for $10,000 (). This sale included Bishop and several other enslaved people. Croghan briefly ran an ill-fated tuberculosis hospital in the cave, the vapors of which he believed would cure his patients. A widespread epidemic disease of the period, tuberculosis would ultimately claim the lives of both Bishop and Croghan.

In 1842, Bishop was sent to Croghan&#x27;s plantation, Locust Grove. He stayed there for two weeks, drawing a map of the Mammoth Cave system from memory. The map was published in 1844 by Morton and Griswold as a pull-out insert in Alexander Clark Bullitt&#x27;s &quot;Rambles in Mammoth Cave in the Year 1844 by a Visiter [sic]&quot; (Morton and Griswold, 1845.) Unusually for an enslaved person, Bishop was given full credit for his work. The Bishop map remained in use for over forty years. 

 Bishop&#x27;s map showed some of cave passages, half of which were discovered by him. While the map does not represent a modern accurate instrumental survey, he took some pains to indicate relative passage dimension and length. The topology, if not the scale and orientation, of the map is accurate, that is, the indications of junction layouts correspond to reality. Carol Ely, executive director of Croghan&#x27;s Locust Grove estate, said that the map was &quot;very accurate in terms of the topography and relationship of the various aspects of the cave’s many branches, less accurate in terms of exact distances.&quot; 

In September 1972 a group of explorers discovered a connection between the Flint Ridge Cave system to the northeast and Mammoth Cave itself. Later it was realized that the Mammoth Cave end of the connection was actually indicated as a passage lead on Bishop&#x27;s 1842 map, as a long thin line branching off from the eastern end of the Echo River complex. The construction in 1905 of a dam on the Green River had caused the passage to be flooded (and therefore inaccessibly hidden by murky water) most of the time after the dam&#x27;s completion, and the passage was rediscovered backwards, from its remote end, by the cavers entering the Flint Ridge Cave System. Although he never knew its significance, Bishop had actually shown the key to connecting two major components of the longest cave in the world, 130 years before the connection was made in 1972.

==Family==
During his time at Croghan&#x27;s estate in 1842 Bishop met Charlotte Brown, an enslaved domestic worker for Croghan&#x27;s family. They were married at Croghan&#x27;s Locust Grove plantation. Charlotte gave birth to their son Thomas Bishop about a year later. Bishop&#x27;s nephew Eddie followed in his uncle&#x27;s footsteps and became a guide at Mammoth Cave also.

==Freedom and death==
In 1852, Bishop guided author Willis to Echo River. On the trip, Willis learned that, despite knowing that he would be freed in five years, Bishop intended to buy his and his wife&#x27;s and son&#x27;s freedom and move to Liberia.

Bishop was freed in 1856, seven years after the death of his enslaver, in accordance with Croghan&#x27;s will. While there are several accounts of Bishop speaking of planning to move to Liberia, he never went. In July 1857 Bishop and his wife sold their plot of land near the cave but Bishop died sometime late that summer. 

Bishop was buried on the south hill above the cave in what became known as &quot;The Old Guides&#x27; Cemetery.&quot; After Stephen Bishop died, his widow Charlotte Brown Bishop married cave guide Nick Bransford, who served as a guide at Mammoth for over 50 years, until Bransford died in 1895. Harold Meloy, writing about Bishop in the book &quot;Cavers, Caves, &amp; Caving&quot; states that &quot;Pittsburgh millionaire James R. Mellon&quot; visited the cave for one week in November 1878, where he heard stories of Bishop and met Charlotte, who then managed the hotel dining room. She led him to Stephen&#x27;s gravesite, &quot;which had only a cedar tree to mark it.&quot; Mellon promised to have a headstone carved for Stephen&#x27;s grave. Three years later, Mellon arranged for a monument carver to prepare a second-hand tombstone, one that a Civil War soldier&#x27;s family had not paid for (hence the appearance of a sword and flag in the lunette). The stone mason chiseled off the original name and placed an inscription that read,
STEPHEN BISHOP, FIRST GUIDE &amp; EXPLORER OF THE MAMMOTH CAVE. DIED JUNE 15, 1859 IN HIS 37 YEAR.
The stone was shipped to the cave and installed on Bishop&#x27;s grave. Meloy states &quot;The error in the date of death [1859 vs. 1857] detracted nothing from the legend now reinforced by a permanent record in stone.&quot;

<text>There are nine bridges across the River Ouse and eighteen smaller bridges and passages across the narrower River Foss within the city of York, England.

==Bridges over the Ouse==

The earliest bridge, built by the Romans, linked Stonegate (the &quot;via praetoria&quot; of the Roman fortress) with Micklegate, crossing the river approximately where the Guildhall now is. Its replacement, Ouse Bridge, was a wooden bridge built about downstream by the Vikings. It has been rebuilt three times, most recently between 1810 and 1820. The Scarborough Railway Bridge of 1845 was the third to be built and was followed by two more road bridges, Lendal Bridge in 1863 and Skeldergate Bridge in 1882. The Millennium Bridge, a footbridge, was added in 2001. There are also Clifton Bridge in the northern suburbs of the city, two modern fly-overs carrying the outer ring road, and the former railway bridge at Naburn, which is now part of the York-Selby cycle path.

North to south, the bridges are:

===Clifton Bridge (1963)===

A temporary bridge over the River Ouse at Clifton was built by the British Army in 1961 on the site of an old ferry crossing to handle additional vehicle traffic caused by the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Kent at York Minster. A permanent bridge was opened officially on 28 October 1963. The bridge is built from 4,000 tons of concrete and 50 tons of reinforced steel.

===Scarborough Railway Bridge (1845)===
The second bridge across the Ouse was the Scarborough Bridge, built in 1845 to carry the railway line between York and Scarborough (now the Scarborough branch of the North TransPennine route). Originally it had two tracks with a pedestrian path in between them. In 1875, the track was raised 4 feet (1.2 m) and the footpath moved to the south side. This bridge had a £6 million renovation in 2015 with the main decks being completely replaced. The narrow footpath, with steps on either side was removed in 2019 and replaced with a much wider bridge suitable for pedestrians and cyclists. It has created a car-free route between the railway station and the city centre and users of National Cycle Network route 65 no longer have to carry their bikes across the bridge. The bridge reopened to the public on 18 April 2019 with work continuing on steps and sections of ramps.

===Lendal Bridge (1863)===

Lendal Bridge stands on the site of a former rope-ferry where the city walls break for the River Ouse. This was the ferry used by Florence Nightingale when she visited York &quot;en route&quot; to Castle Howard in 1852.

The bridge connects two medieval towers: Lendal Tower on the east bank and Barker Tower on the west bank. It was designed by civil engineer Thomas Page, who also designed London&#x27;s Westminster Bridge. It is made of cast iron, and has a single span of .

Page&#x27;s bridge was the second attempt to build a bridge on the site. The first, begun in 1860 by William Dredge, collapsed during construction, and five workmen were killed. Parts of the structure were later taken to Scarborough and used in the Valley Bridge there.

In 1861, permission was obtained from Parliament for a new bridge to be built, and the Corporation of York requested Thomas Page to design a replacement. His Gothic Revival bridge opened in 1863. Together with the attached tollhouses it is a Grade II listed building. In August 1892, champion diver Tommy Burns dived off the bridge, watched by several hundred spectators and afterwards &quot;gave an exhibition of ornamental swimming&quot;.

Lendal Bridge links Station Road with Museum Street and thus York railway station with York Minster, and is part of York&#x27;s Inner Ring Road. The Maltings pub, near the south end of the bridge, was formerly named the &quot;Lendal Bridge Hotel&quot;.

Lendal Bridge was used in &quot;Damon and Debbie&quot;, a 1987 spin-off of soap &quot;Brookside&quot; for the scenes where long-running character Damon Grant was murdered. The BBC Television series &#x27;Gunpowder&#x27; (2017) used Lendal Bridge as a location.

Motor traffic (except for buses) was restricted daily from 10.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Lendal Bridge during a six-month trial period from August 2013 to February 2014. The trial objectives were to establish whether a permanent restriction would reduce congestion in York city centre, improve the environment and improve the reliability of certain bus routes. The traffic ban was enforced with ANPR cameras. Air quality and bus route reliability increased during the trial but the public and business opinions on the trial were mixed and enforcement ruled invalid on a signage technicality so the bridge was re-opened to motor traffic after the trial.

===Ouse Bridge (1821)===
The original Roman bridge over the Ouse was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge built further downstream by the Vikings. In 1154, it collapsed under the weight of a crowd which had gathered to greet St William of York on his return from exile. It was replaced by a stone bridge in the second half of the 12th century. In 1367 the first public toilets in Yorkshire, and likely England, were opened on the bridge. Part of the bridge was swept away by floods in the winter of 1564–65. The repaired bridge of 1565 had a new central arch spanning 81 ft, and was described by Defoe as &quot;...near 70 foot [21 m] in diameter; it is, without exception, the greatest in England, some say it&#x27;s as large as the Rialto at Venice, though I think not.&quot; There was originally a number of buildings on the bridge, including a chapel, gaol, houses and shops; these were torn down between 1745 and 1793. This bridge was dismantled between 1810 and 1818 to make way for the New Ouse Bridge, designed by Peter Atkinson the younger, completed in 1821.

It is a Grade II listed building.

===Skeldergate Bridge (1881)===

Skeldergate Bridge links the York Castle area to Bishophill. Parliament passed the , after the city had determined that over 800 people were using the Skeldergate ferry crossing daily. It was designed in a Gothic Revival style by civil engineer George Gordon Page, and built between 1878 and 1881. The small arch at the east end had an opening portion, powered by machinery in the Motor House, which also served as a toll house and accommodation for the toll keeper and his family. The bridge opened to admit tall masted ships to the quays on either side of the river between Skeldergate and Ouse Bridges. The bridge was last opened in 1975, and the machinery has since been removed. Skeldergate Bridge was formally declared free of tolls on 1 April 1914. Together with the attached tollhouse, now a cafe, it is a Grade II listed building.

===Millennium Bridge (2001)===

The Millennium Bridge, built to a competition-winning design by Whitby Bird and Partners, was opened on 10 April 2001, having cost £4.2 million to build. It spans the River Ouse to the south of York, linking Hospital Fields Road and Maple Grove in Fulford with Butcher Terrace on the South Bank. The bridge carries a cycle path and a footpath, and is not open to vehicular traffic. It is a key link in the Sustrans National Cycle Routes 65/66 and is part of the orbital route for York completed in 2011. The bridge shortened the walk or cycle for students from houses in the South Bank to the University of York (they previously had to travel via Skeldergate Bridge).

The bridge also acts a meeting place for local people, as it has a waist height shelf spanning the whole structure which facilitates sitting and admiring the view. Increasingly it is used as a circular walk from the city centre taking in the New Walk on the east bank and Terry Avenue and Rowntree Park on the west bank. While riverside paths regularly flood several times a year the bridge is higher and rarely cut off by floodwaters. Signs on approaches from Fulford Road /Hospital Fields Road junction and Butcher Terrace/Bishopthorpe Road warn when it may be impassable without wellies.

At night the bridge is illuminated by banks of lights in different colours, so that the colour of illumination changes every few seconds.

Supplies for Fulford Barracks were brought in by river near this location, and the remains of a narrow gauge railway may be seen on the eastern bank of the river a few yards toward the city. There used to be a rope ferry at this location as well. There may have been a rope ferry at one time, but in the 20th century it was a sculled ferry (rowed by a single oar at the stern) right into the 1950s when the ferry boat became motorised. It was particularly used by the Terry&#x27;s workers (with their bikes), who lived on the Fulford side of the Ouse.

===Naburn Railway Bridge (1871)===

Outside the outer ring-road, the Naburn swing bridge, built in 1871, used to carry the York-Selby railway until it was diverted in 1983. The bridge now constitutes part of the York &amp; Selby cycle path, connecting the Trans Pennine trail to York. It is also known as the &quot;Fisherman Bridge&quot; due to a large metal sculpture of a fisherman with bike and dog, sitting on top which was added in 2000 as part of the York Council &quot;Creative Communities 2000&quot; scheme.
==Bridges over the Foss==

From north to south, to the confluence with the Ouse, these are:

Many of these are small pedestrian crossings or unobtrusive modern bridges carrying main roads. The following are more notable:

===Monk Bridge (1794)===
Monk Bridge is a single-arched ashlar bridge with a span of approximately . It carries traffic between central York and Heworth and was built in 1794 to designs by Peter Atkinson the elder. In 1924–6, the bridge was widened and the upper part rebuilt.

===Pedestrian bridge from Foss Island Road to Defra site (1931)===
This cast-iron pedestrian bridge from Foss Islands Road to what is now the Defra site at Peasholme Green was constructed in 1931 by the Monk Bridge Construction Company to improve communications between York&#x27;s power station and its cooling tower, both now demolished. It is locked and not in use.

===Hungate Bridge (2011)===
Opened in September 2011, Hungate bridge is a cable-stayed cycle and foot bridge that links Navigation Road and Palmer Street. It has an span with a single supporting mast on the north bank.

National Cycle Network Route 658 uses the bridge. It is also on the route of the Way of the Roses coast to coast route and is part of York&#x27;s network of traffic-free cycleways.

===Foss Bridge (1812)===
The Foss Bridge, a single Georgian gritstone arch with balusters, links the streets Fossgate and Walmgate. It is believed that the earliest bridge on this site was constructed during the Viking period. The present bridge, designed by Peter Atkinson the younger and erected in 1811–12, replaced a wooden bridge. The bridge was once the site of a fish market. It is a Grade II* listed building.

===Blue Bridge (1930)===
The Blue Bridge crosses the River Foss just above its confluence with the River Ouse. The original bridge on the site was built in 1738, the current one being constructed in 1929–30.

In the early 1730s a section of the eastern river bank of the Ouse was improved, at the expense of the city, to create an area lined with trees along which the citizens could promenade. It proved so popular that within a few years this New Walk was extended further south past the junction with the Foss by way of a wooden drawbridge. This new bridge was painted blue and the colour and name have endured though the bridge itself has been replaced several times, the first of these being in 1768 when a single-arch stone bridge was constructed. In 1792 the Foss Navigation Company built a wooden swing-bridge to enable boats to access the Foss and this type of bridge was used again when the bridge was rebuilt in 1834. In 1857–58 an iron opening-bridge was built along with two stone plinths upon which stood two Russian cannons. These had been captured at the Battle of Sebastopol in 1855 and became the Crimean War Memorial in York and as such were retained when the current bridge was built in 1929–30 only to be removed in 1941 when they were scrapped and melted down for the war effort. In 2020, the bridge was to be temporarily removed for refurbishments, with a scaffold bridge taking its place.

<text>Scottsdale Fashion Square is an upscale luxury shopping mall located in the downtown area of Scottsdale, Arizona, United States. It is the largest shopping mall in the state, with approximately of retail space, and is among the top 30 largest malls in the country. The mall features Macy&#x27;s, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Dillard&#x27;s, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, in addition to a 14-screen Harkins Theatres.

It has consistently been one of the most profitable malls in the United States, being ranked in 2016 as the second highest sales per square foot mall in the country, and as of 2016, it was ranked in the top 25 most visited malls in the country by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine. The mall is located on the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Camelback Road in Scottsdale, Arizona, and has been owned by Westcor, a subsidiary of Macerich, since 2002.

== History ==
During the 1930s and 1940s, the land which would become the Scottsdale Fashion Square was too far from the established Scottsdale and Phoenix business areas to be considered valuable. A Ryan-Evans drug store was the only retail establishment on the site. During the 1940s the 40-acre site was purchased by Harry Lenart. In the 1950s the land was used for a rodeo stadium before he began to plan for a small shopping center. In 1959, the center opened consisting of four stores in addition to the existing drug store: a grocery store, barber shop, liquor store, and camera store. In 1960 a steakhouse, built by Joe Hunt Sr. was added.

Scottsdale Fashion Square was originally built as a three-story open-air structure in 1961. The structure was designed by Edward L. Varney Associates, and built by Kitchell Contractors. It was anchored by two local Phoenix stores, department store Goldwater&#x27;s and supermarket AJ Bayless. At the time, the primary competitor was the Los Arcos Mall, a fully enclosed mall built in 1969, also located in Scottsdale. Its early financial success led to an expansion of the west-side of the mall in 1974, which nearly doubled the square-footage of the mall. This expansion also added an additional department store, Diamond&#x27;s, to the northern section of the mall.

In 1977, a competing mall, the fully enclosed Camelview Plaza, was built just west of Scottsdale Fashion Square, on the other side of North 70th Street. The competing mall was developed by Chicago business-man John F. Cuneo. Belli &amp; Belli also of Chicago were the architects of the new mall. Camelview Plaza boasted Los Angeles department store Bullock&#x27;s and Sakowitz. The shopping center also included a Harkins Camelview Theatre on an outparcel.

For several years, the two malls competed for shoppers and tenants. In 1982 after Westcor&#x27;s purchase of the mall, the owners agreed to connect the malls by building a two-story retail bridge across North 70th Street, replacing the shuttle service that ran between the two malls. In the process, the street separating the two malls was sunk below grade-level, widened to four lanes, and renamed North Goldwater Boulevard. The two malls were largely gutted and completely renovated. Dillard&#x27;s took over the former AJ Bayless and Diamond&#x27;s spaces to create a new department store, while Goldwater&#x27;s was expanded to . A ground-level food court, anchored by a 7-screen Harkins Theatres cinema, was also added. The redevelopment was completed in 1991, closely followed by the addition of Neiman Marcus (in the former Sakowitz) in 1992.

Goldwater&#x27;s became J. W. Robinson&#x27;s in 1989, only to be converted into Robinsons-May in 1993. Bullock&#x27;s closed its doors at Camelview Plaza in 1996, and remained vacant for several years. That same year, Westcor purchased Camelview Plaza and renamed the entire shopping plaza, Scottsdale Fashion Square. The new ownership brought major changes to the mall, the largest being the addition of a new wing anchored by Arizona&#x27;s first Nordstrom store and featuring many upscale retailers. At that time, Dillard&#x27;s took over the former Bullock&#x27;s store and expanded it to , making the Scottsdale store the largest in the company&#x27;s fleet. This expansion increased the mall&#x27;s square footage to and made it the 13th largest enclosed shopping mall in the country. The expansion was completed in 1998 and was designed by Callison Architects Inc. of Seattle the addition was built by the original contractor Kitchell.

Additions like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom were facilitated with aid from the city. For instance, the city gave the mall a $4 million tax rebate to attract Neiman Marcus and a 90 percent rebate on city sales tax generated at the waterfront for 25 years to bring in Nordstrom in the late 1990s.

Sears briefly occupied the former Dillard&#x27;s store, only to be replaced by Macy&#x27;s in 2002.

The merger between Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores brought the closure Robinsons-May in June 2006, leading the mall to demolish the former department store and build another new wing anchored by Barneys New York. The new wing, which also featured an H&amp;M store, opened in 2009. That same year, the first Microsoft Store opened elsewhere in the mall.

Another expansion was added in 2015: a two-level building with Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods on the lower level and a new 14-screen Harkins Theatres cinema on the top level. In early 2016, Barneys New York announced it would shutter its Scottsdale Fashion Square store. In late 2016 the mall&#x27;s owner, Macerich, announced plans of a new renovation, in excess of $100 million, which will include high-end residential units, a hotel, a new luxury entrance, hospitality areas and office space. Construction began in 2017, with the renovation completed in the fall of 2018. Apple relocated their store from Biltmore Fashion Park to build a new store at the Scottsdale Fashion Square location on September 29, 2018.

In 2019, Scottsdale Fashion Square transformed the former Barneys New York location into a co-working space operated by Industrious, a Manhattan-based company. The co-working space spans two stories and approximately 33,000 square feet at the mall&#x27;s east corner near Scottsdale and Camelback roads.

Later in 2021 a luxury fitness center, Life Time Fitness, announced they would be opening outside of the northwest luxury entrance. The 40,000-square-foot, three-level fitness center would be outside the mall&#x27;s so-called &quot;luxury wing,&quot; where Nobu, Tocaya Modern Mexican, Zinque, and other restaurants are located.

In early October 2022, Macerich reported they were going to be continuing the luxury renovations from 2018 throughout the exterior and interior of the southern Nordstrom wing. It would include &quot;two-story storefronts and exterior-facing retail buildings at the south entrance, and a porte cochere that will incorporate up to five destination restaurants&quot;, and a luxury valet service. Macerich also stated, &quot;Everything will come together to deliver a more cohesive and holistic luxury experience for guests and retailers throughout the property.&quot; This renovation started in late January 2023.

By 2023, since the government lockdown, Scottsdale Fashion Square had announced several new additions, including Hermès, Gucci Men&#x27;s Store, Versace, Warby Parker, Fabletics, Levi&#x27;s, Golden Goose, Casper, Capital One Café, Buck Mason, Psycho Bunny, and Lucid Studio.

In May 2023, Scottsdale Fashion Square announced the addition of Élephante, an upscale, experiential restaurant from the Wish You Were Here Group. This new location, spanning 12,000 square feet, marks the first expansion of Élephante outside Los Angeles. The restaurant will feature an indoor-outdoor space, a cocktail lounge, and a menu that includes wood-fired pizzas, fresh pastas, premium meats, and a wine selection of over 1,200 labels.

It was later announced that Macerich planned an opening of a boutique hotel for March 2024 under the name Caesar&#x27;s Republic Scottsdale. In addition new restaurants were announced to open soon including Catch Seafood for the main mall as well as Luna and Pronto, followed by Seven for the Caesars Republic Scottsdale hotel.

On February 29, 2024, Scottsdale Fashion Square held its grand opening ceremony to celebrate the launch of its new hotel the Caesar&#x27;s Republic Scottsdale. The 11-story, 265 room hotel is located on the north side where it officially opened to the public on March 6 of that same year.

=== Performance and economic impact ===
As of September 30, 2018 Scottsdale Fashion Square reported the sixth-highest sales per square foot among Macerich&#x27;s 54 properties, achieving $1,032 per square foot, according to SEC filings. The mall maintains a high occupancy rate of 92.6 percent and boasts annual sales exceeding $650 million.

In 2016, it contributed $13.1 million in sales tax revenue to the City of Scottsdale, accounting for approximately 7 percent of the city&#x27;s total sales tax revenue of $187.2 million for that year. Mayor Jim Lane highlighted the mutual benefits, stating, “We’ve always felt that Fashion Square’s success is the city’s success, and we also do believe that the city’s success also lends itself to Fashion Square’s success.”

=== Covid-19 ===
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted shopping malls across the country, including Scottsdale Fashion Square. According to Macerich executives, the overall occupancy rate for the company&#x27;s malls dropped to 91 percent, and traffic was at about 80 percent of the previous year&#x27;s levels. Sales were trending at 90 percent compared to the previous year. Macerich&#x27;s revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $185.8 million, down 19.6 percent from a year earlier. Despite these challenges, there were signs of improvement. By October 7, 2020, all of Macerich&#x27;s malls had reopened, and the company reported improvements in rent collections, reaching about 80 percent in the third quarter, up from 64 percent in the second quarter. Macerich also managed to secure agreements with most tenants to defer back rent payments to 2021. Those tenants that weren&#x27;t able to secure agreements filed lawsuits including The Disney Store, Gap, Banana Republic, and more.

In response Scottsdale Fashion Square issued new hygiene and safety protocols to combat the virus. Eventually they received the Bureau Veritas’ SafeGuard™ Hygiene Excellence and Safety Certification, recognizing its best-in-class hygiene and safety protocols. This certification, granted by a world-leading provider in testing, inspection, and certification, acknowledges that the 1.9-million-square-foot center has exceeded stringent requirements to minimize the onsite risk of virus spread. “The health and safety of our shoppers and employees is our first priority,” said Sutton, the center&#x27;s representative.

== Events and attractions ==

=== Caesar&#x27;s Republic Hotel ===
In March 2024, the new Caesars Republic Hotel opened adjacent to Scottsdale Fashion Square. This marks Caesars Entertainment&#x27;s first non-gaming property in the United States. The 11-story hotel features 265 guestrooms, 20,000 square feet of event space, two pools, and three restaurants.

=== Lunar New Year ===
Scottsdale Fashion Square frequently hosts a variety of cultural and community events. One notable event is the annual Lunar New Year celebration, organized in partnership with Phoenix Chinese Week. On January 27, 2024, Scottsdale Fashion Square and partners from Phoenix Chinese Week gathered to celebrate the Lunar New Year. The celebration, marking the Year of the Dragon, featured an enormous dragon dancing throughout the shopping center, symbolizing good luck and prosperity for the new year.

== Security and safety ==

===George Floyd protests===
In 2020, the mall was vandalized and looted after protesters violated curfew during the George Floyd protests. The police made twelve arrests including YouTube star and boxer Jake Paul, who claimed that he did not take part in the looting and was only recording it. Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly on June 4 for entering the mall illegally with the rioters. The first court date began on July 8. On August 5, 2020, the charges were dismissed without prejudice, with the Scottsdale Police Department saying it was &quot;in the best interest of the community&quot; and that a federal criminal investigation would be completed instead.

=== Incident involving off-duty police officer ===
On February 19, 2018, an off-duty police officer working security at Scottsdale Fashion Square shot and killed a man in the Brown Parking Garage. The incident occurred after the officer responded to reports of the man&#x27;s &quot;erratic behavior,&quot; which led employees to suspect him of shoplifting. According to the Scottsdale Police Department, the man raised a handgun when the officer identified himself and commanded the man to stop. The officer fired his service weapon, stopping the man. Despite attempts by police and fire crews to save his life, the man died at the scene. The suspect, who had a warrant for his arrest on drug violations, was found with several shoplifted items and a loaded semi-automatic handgun. The off-duty officer involved in the shooting, a 12-year veteran of the Scottsdale Police Department, was placed on paid administrative leave following the incident.

== Controversies ==

=== Municipal bond controversy ===
A parking garage adjacent to the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (aka the &quot;Nordstrom Garage&quot;) was constructed by Scottsdale Fashion Square Partners and leased to the City of Scottsdale in 1998 for 50 years for $31,375,000. In 2012 Scottsdale Mayor Jim Lane and the city council approved a prepayment of the lease, financed by issuance of municipal bonds. However, in 2015 the IRS notified the city that the issuance was being challenged for non-compliance with the federal tax code. One possible basis for such challenges is failure of the &quot;public purpose test&quot;.

=== Zoning changes ===
Macerich CEO Ken Greenberg acknowledged that the mall&#x27;s current dense downtown location would not have been chosen today for its development, preferring a location adjacent to a freeway with space to expand horizontally. This unconventional location led to the pursuit of zoning changes to build vertically instead. The most recent changes in 2017 faced resistance from local residents due to the mall&#x27;s request for increased building heights to develop hotel, office, and residential spaces. Macerich addressed some community concerns by increasing setback requirements, adding open spaces, and limiting building heights to 90 feet in certain areas.

=== Stores closing ===
Scottsdale Fashion Square has undergone significant transformations, including the introduction of new high-end stores and extensive construction projects. As of 2023, several long-time tenants, including Williams Sonoma, Crate &amp; Barrel, and Ann Taylor, have closed their stores due to the mall&#x27;s shift towards becoming a luxury center. ASU professor Hitendra Chaturvedu commented that this was a smart decision to take advantage of the growing affluence in the area. As a result of these strategic moves, the mall has faced criticism for not renewing leases of long-time tenants and prioritizing luxury retailers.

<doc id="1006532" wikidata="Q5204483" url="?curid=1006532" title="DCC plc">
<text>DCC plc is a leading Irish international sales, marketing and support services group. Headquartered in Dublin, the Group operates across three sectors: energy, healthcare and technology. DCC plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
The company was founded by Jim Flavin in 1976 as Development Capital Corporation Limited. Originally the company focused on providing venture capital to start ups, however in the mid-1980s it changed direction and became an industrial holding company, changing its name to DCC and floating on the Irish Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange in 1994.

The company was embroiled in a controversy over the issue of insider trading in Fyffes plc, the Irish fruit importing company in which a subsidiary of DCC, Lotus Green, held a stake which was sold in the year 2000. In 2002 Fyffes sued DCC over the sale of its stake in the company. The case was tried in the Irish High Court from December 2004 until July 2005, and on 21 December 2005 judgement was handed down. DCC was cleared of insider trading, although it was found to have been acting as a &quot;single entity&quot; with Lotus Green and Jim Flavin with regards to the sale of the shares. Fyffes appealed to the Supreme Court of Ireland and, in a judgement on 27 July 2007, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court&#x27;s verdict and ruled that the documents that had been in Flavin&#x27;s possession when DCC sold the shares had indeed been price sensitive. In April 2008, Fyffes settled its case against DCC for an amount of €37.6 million. As a result of this case, DCC and Flavin came under the examination of the Irish Director of Corporate Enforcement. In January 2010, The report of the High Court Inspector into the affairs of DCC plc was published. The Director of Corporate Enforcement concluded that no further action was warranted by his Office.

In 2011, DCC bought Maxol&#x27;s Home Heating company, Maxol Direct, which it re-branded as Emo. In 2012, DCC spent around €100 million acquiring LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) distribution businesses in the Netherlands, Britain, Sweden and Norway.

In August 2014, DCC announced that it reached an agreement with ExxonMobil to acquire the Esso Express petrol station network and the Esso Motorway concessions in France.

The company joined the FTSE 100 share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation in December 2015.

In February 2015, DCC completed the disposal of substantially all its Food &amp; Beverage subsidiaries. During the same year the company acquired Butagaz S.A.S., a French LPG business, from Shell for €464 million. The acquisition made DCC Europe&#x27;s third-largest LPG distributor.

In March 2016, the company agreed to acquire Alimentation Couche Tard&#x27;s commercial and aviation fuels business in Denmark for €40 million. The deal included a 139-site retail petrol station network and supply contracts with 66 dealers.

In April 2017, DCC announced it had agreed to sell its Environmental division to Exponent, a private equity firm, for £219 million. The company also announced the acquisition of Shell&#x27;s liquefied petroleum gas business in Hong Kong and Macau for £120 million, its first acquisition outside of Europe, and the retirement of its chief executive Tommy Breen.

In July 2017 Donal Murphy, previously Managing Director of DCC Energy, became Chief Executive.

In 2018, DCC Healthcare completed its first acquisition in the US Health and Beauty sector: Elite One Source Nutritional Services. In the same year DCC Technology purchased Stampede – also its first foray into North America.

In 2019 DCC purchased the retail fuel operations of Tesco Ireland, with these being converted to automated stations under &quot;Certa&quot; branding. This branding is a variant of the &quot;Certas&quot; name which is used for home heating oil in the UK and as the holding company for their Esso branded stations in Europe.

In 2021, DCC acquired Almo Corporation in Group&#x27;s largest acquisition to date. 

In 2022, DCC announced a new strategy for its energy businesses. The core of this strategy was to bring decarbonisation solutions for its 9.5 million DCC Energy customers. Various acquisitions were made in services and renewable energy – Protech, Sys EnR, PVO and Freedom Heat Pumps. 

In September 2022, DCC Healthcare significantly expanded in medical devices with its largest acquisition to date, Medi-Globe. 

In 2023, DCC Energy grew its share of services and renewables profit to 28% and made further acquisitions in the space – AEI, Hafod Renewable Energy and O&#x27;SiTOiT.

==Divisions==
The company is organised into three divisions: DCC Energy, DCC Healthcare and DCC Technology.

<doc id="1006535" wikidata="Q238060" url="?curid=1006535" title="49er (dinghy)">
<text>The 49er and 49er FX is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy. The two crew work on different roles with the helm making many tactical decisions, as well as steering, and the crew doing most of the sail control. Both of the crew are equipped with their own trapeze and sailing is done while cantilevered over the water to the fullest extent to balance against the sails.

The 49er was designed by Julian Bethwaite (the son of Frank Bethwaite) and developed by a consortium consisting of Bethwaites, Performance Sailcraft Japan, Peter Johnston, and Ovington boats. The boat has been an Olympic class since it was selected by the International Sailing Federation to be the men&#x27;s high performance double handed dinghy Sydney Summer Games of 2000. Its derivative featuring a re-designed rig, the 49er FX, was selected by World Sailing to be the women&#x27;s high performance double-hander at the Rio Summer Olympics of 2016.

==History==
The 49er&#x27;s name comes from its hull length of . It incorporates ideas developed in Julian Bethwaite&#x27;s 18ft Skiffs, notably the Prime Computer series of boats, which were double handers.

To handle a large and powerful sail area, the mast uses a square topped sail that causes the upper main to twist off and flatten, allowing a controllable sail with fast gust response and reducing the heeling moment. The use of solid wings, rather than tubes as on similar boats (RS800 etc.), makes it easier for the crew to run across the deck from gunwale to gunwale during maneuvers.

The 49er made its first Olympic appearance at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and has continued to grow in popularity ever since.

With a Portsmouth yardstick Handicap of 740 the 49er is the fastest two person one-design monohull dinghy.

In 2009 the boat received a new rig design, including a larger fully carbon mast (replacing the aluminum mast) and square top (roach) mainsail.

As a one design class, the 49er has two licensed suppliers, Mackay Boats in Oceania and Ovington in Europe.

===Hull===
The hull is made of Epoxy GRP and foam sandwich laminate with carbon fibre in high load areas. It includes two solid wings, also called racks, that clip into the side to increase righting moment of the trapezing crew. Its length was fixed at 4.99 metres because the ISAF brief for the high performance Olympic class dinghy called for a 5-metre boat, but Tokao Otani, a member of the development consortium, pointed out that there was a tariff in Japan for boats over 5 metres long. It has a fine entry to efficiently transition between the low speed displacement, and high speed planing modes. According to the International 49er class rules, the minimum hull weight including all permanent fittings can not be less than 94.0 kg.
===Spars===
Southern Spars, part of the North Technology Group, is the licensed supplier of the 49er mast. It is a three piece male-moulded assembly made from 100% standard modulus carbon. It is 7.0 metres tall and capable of supporting a combined crew weight up to 165 kg from its dual trapeze. The mast is braced by three sets of shrouds that connect to a fitting on the side of the boat. The crew is able to adjust them by tightening or loosening them, depending on the wind speed and sea states.

The boom is made from an aluminium alloy extrusion.

===Foils===
The rudder and daggerboard are made from a composite of epoxy, carbon and glass, covered by a hard gelcoat surface. The head of each class legal foil carries the embossed 49er logo and the ICA label.

===Sails===
The 49er carries three sails: a mainsail, jib, and spinnaker. The main and jib combined are 20 square metres, fully battened and made of reinforced Mylar (film polyester). The main was redesigned in 2007 from a full, curved roach plan to having a square on top in order to provide more sail area and to control more shape adjustment. The spinnaker is 38 square metres in a tri-radial asymmetric shape.

==Related boats==

The 49er FX was developed by Mackay Boats to be a women&#x27;s Olympic class. It consists of a 49er hull, wings, and foils, with a scaled down rig designed to suit the weight of an elite female crew.

The 29er is a smaller, single trapeze trainer to the 49er. It has become popular in North America, Europe and Australia as a fast youth boat. Recently the 29erXX, a twin trapeze version of the 29er, has been produced with a rig very similar to the 49er.

The 59er dinghy was put into production in Australia and the UK in 2002. It is a non-trapeze, sailing dinghy, rigged with an asymmetrical spinnaker. It is designed for a crew weight of .

<text>In traditional grammar and guide books, a linking verb is a verb that describes the subject by connecting it to a predicate adjective or predicate noun (collectively known as subject complements). 

Linking verbs include copulas such as the English verb &quot;be&quot; and its various forms, as well as verbs of perception such as &quot;look&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, or &quot;taste&quot; and some other verbs that describe the subject, such as &quot;seem&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, or &quot;remain&quot;. In addition to predicate adjectives and predicate nouns, English allows for predicate prepositional phrases as well: &quot;John is behind the cocktail cabinet&quot;.

The following sentences include linking verbs.
*Roses &quot;are&quot; red.
*The detective &quot;felt&quot; sick.
*The soup &quot;tasted&quot; weird.

<text>Certa Ireland (formerly Emo) is an Irish oil distribution brand that is based in Portlaoise, Republic of Ireland. The Certa Ireland brand is owned and operated by DCC Plc which also has operations in Northern Ireland where it maintains the Emo brand. The Certa brand was introduced in September 2022 out of the amalgamation of the former Irish brands, Jones Oil, Emo Oil, Campus Oil, CC Lubricants and Source Lubrication Solutions.

==Operations in the Republic of Ireland==
Certa Ireland operates out of several regional depots and petrol filling stations throughout the Republic of Ireland. Emo significantly expanded its operations in 1999, to include retail from filling stations with the purchase of the Burmah Fuels filling station network. Recently, Emo Oil had celebrated its 35th birthday.

DCC plc also own the nominally competing filling station franchise GreatGas, having bought it in 2009. However, there appears to be no plans to integrate this with Certa, as new GreatGas locations have continued to open - in particular at unmanned locations.

DCC plc also purchased the filling station operations of Tesco Ireland in 2020, These are now branded under Certa.

Certa Ireland supplies all grades of oil to several sectors including distributors, petrol stations, commercial enterprises and direct to home heating oil users. Their coverage currently includes Dublin and counties Limerick, Westmeath, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny and Laois. The company offers 24-hour delivery, co-operative and helpful drivers, aftercare services, online ordering, and the option to pay through An Post or any Post Point location (a service currently unique to Certa Ireland). The current managing director of Certa Ireland is Andrew Graham.

==Operations in Northern Ireland==
In Northern Ireland, Emo Oil is a high-profile brand name of DCC Energy Ltd, an energy company based in Belfast with several regional depots across Northern Ireland. The current managing director for Emo Oil in Northern Ireland is Donal Murphy.

In 2011, DCC Energy bought Maxol Direct, the home heating side of Maxol in Northern Ireland, which was then incorporated into Emo Oil by 2012.

Despite Emo rebranding to Certa, the Emo brand remains in Northern Ireland.

<doc id="1006592" wikidata="Q2375" url="?curid=1006592" title="Nome, Norway">
<text>Nome is a municipality in Telemark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Midt-Telemark and historically part of the Grenland region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ulefoss. Other villages include Bjervamoen, Ulefoss, Helgja, Flåbygd, and Svenseid.

The municipality is the 230th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Nome is the 150th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 6,559. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 1% over the previous 10-year period.

Nome is a large agricultural and forestry municipality. The agricultural area in Nome is approximately . Forest harvesting averaged annually in the five-year period 2017–2021. Just over half was spruce, the rest was pine.

==General information==
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. The municipality of Nome was established on 1 January 1964 when the two neighboring municipalities of Holla (population: 4,093) and Lunde (population: 3,080) were merged. (Most of Holla became part of Nome. The Valebø part of Holla located east of the lake Norsjø became part of Skien Municipality on that date.)

===Name===
The municipality is named after the Nomevatnet lake which is at the start of the river Eidselva. The meaning of the name is uncertain. It may be related to the first element in the name Numedal.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 10 March 1989. The official blazon is &quot;Per bend sinistre dancetty argent and azure&quot; (). This means the arms are divided with a diagonal line that is dancetty (in the shape of steps). The field (background) below the line has a tincture of blue. Above the line, the field has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The design is meant to represent the Telemark Canal and its locks to raise and lower boats. The canal was built in the 19th century and it runs through the municipality, connecting the lake Bandak to the North Sea. The arms were designed by Øyvind Larsen. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Nome. It is part of the Øvre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.


Romnes Church (&quot;Romnes kirke&quot;) is a Romanesque stone church that was built between 1150 and 1250. The church was constructed of stone joined with lime, while the corners consist of limestone. The apse and nave has a flat ceiling, while the choir has vaulted wood ceilings. The entrance portal to the west is of decorated stone. The church also had an entrance on the south wall in the choir. The pulpit and baroque altarpiece are from the 1700s. The square bell tower dates to the end of the 1800s. The church currently has curved red bricks on the roof. During the restoration in 1921, murals from the late Middle Ages were restored. Additional restoration was conducted between 1966 and 1967.

==Government==
Nome Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Telemark District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

<text>Hesya Mirovna (Meerovna) Helfman (; ; 1855 — ) was a Belarusian-Jewish revolutionary member of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;, who was implicated in the assassination of Alexander II of Russia. Escaping execution as she was pregnant at the time, she died in the aftermath of childbirth in prison.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Helfman was born into a religious Jewish family, in Mozyr, Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire. She received no schooling, and had a husband picked for her by her father while she was a teenager. She ran away from home in 1868, before the wedding could take place. She lived with a local Christian friend, then moved to Kyiv, where she worked as a seamstress and began training to be a midwife.

===Revolutionary activities===

In the early 1870s, Helfman was an active member of several revolutionary clubs in Kiev where she met, among others, Leo Deutsch and her future husband . Helfman was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment at the during the 1877 , and on 14 March 1879 was sent into exile to the province Novgorod.

She escaped a few months later and joined &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; in Saint Petersburg, probably following her husband who was a member of the organization&#x27;s executive committee. In 1881 Helfman was part of the &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; group that assassinated Alexander II, albeit not in a front-line position; she was assigned to run a conspiratorial flat, where she lived with another member of the group, Nikolai Sablin, as an unsuspicious apparent married couple. When the police raided their apartment, two days after the deadly attack on the tsar, Sablin shot himself while she was captured.

===Death===
During the Pervomartovtsy trial in March 1881, Helfman refused to admit her guilt, but was nonetheless sentenced to death by hanging for her alleged part in the assassination of the tsar. A few hours after being convicted, she made a statement that &quot;in view of the ... sentence I have received, I consider it my moral duty to declare that I am in the fourth month of pregnancy&quot;. Her husband Nikolay Kolodkevich had also been arrested in January 1881. According to contemporary law, execution of pregnant women was banned as the unborn child was considered innocent. Therefore, Helfman&#x27;s execution was officially postponed until forty days after childbirth, and in the meantime she would stay in the harsh Peter and Paul Fortress prison.

Three months later, thanks to the campaign against her execution by Socialists in Western Europe and in the foreign press, Helfman&#x27;s sentence was commuted to an indefinite period of katorga (forced labor). She was transferred back to the remand prison where she had been held before. On 5 July (NS), whilst still in the Peter and Paul Fortress and by permission of the Minister of the Interior, Count Ignatiev, she was granted an interview (which lasted almost an hour and a half) with a journalist from the newspaper &quot;Golos&quot; who was accompanied by her defence counsel at her trial, a lawyer named Goerke. During the course of this interview, she complained about the lack of &quot;proper medical and female attendance&quot;.

Helfman gave birth in detention in October 1881. Upon the request of the Department of Police, her childbirth was assisted by a gynaecologist who was also employed by the Imperial court, something unprecedented. She had a severe maternal complication, as her perineum was torn. It was rumoured that the gynaecologist had refused the prison doctor&#x27;s suggestion to sew the wound together; in any case, it never healed. She remained delirious during some of the postnatal period. By 24 November, she had developed peritonitis, which became acute on 17 January 1882. She nevertheless nursed her daughter from her birth in October until 25 January, when the baby was taken away from her, placed in an orphanage and registered as a child of unknown parents. According to the subsequent medical report, the peritonitis became general and caused fever on the same day. Six days later, Helfman died. Her child died of an unknown disease shortly thereafter. Tsarist authorities had rejected the request of Kolodkevich&#x27;s parents for the legal custody of the baby. Kolodkevich died in prison in 1884.

==Legacy==
The importance of Helfman&#x27;s role in the assassination was undetermined, and her Jewish origins stressed during the pogroms that followed the assassination. Another conspirator, Ignacy Hryniewiecki, was also rumoured to be Jewish, though there seems to have been no basis for this.

Revolutionary Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky dedicated a chapter of his &quot;Underground Russia&quot; (1883) to Helfman, the only one dedicated to a person he had not met personally. Writes Stepnyak:

<doc id="1006597" wikidata="Q587024" url="?curid=1006597" title="Nanorobotics">
<text>Nanoid robotics, or for short, nanorobotics or nanobotics, is an emerging technology field creating machines or robots, which are called nanorobots or simply nanobots, whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). More specifically, nanorobotics (as opposed to microrobotics) refers to the nanotechnology engineering discipline of designing and building nanorobots with devices ranging in size from 0.1 to 10 micrometres and constructed of nanoscale or molecular components. The terms &quot;nanobot&quot;, &quot;nanoid&quot;, &quot;nanite&quot;, &quot;nanomachine&quot; and &quot;nanomite&quot; have also been used to describe such devices currently under research and development.

Nanomachines are largely in the research and development phase, but some primitive molecular machines and nanomotors have been tested. An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, able to count specific molecules in the chemical sample. The first useful applications of nanomachines may be in nanomedicine. For example, biological machines could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells. Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals, and the measurement of their concentrations, in the environment. Rice University has demonstrated a single-molecule car developed by a chemical process and including Buckminsterfullerenes (buckyballs) for wheels. It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip.

Another definition is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution. Such devices are more related to microscopy or scanning probe microscopy, instead of the description of nanorobots as molecular machines. Using the microscopy definition, even a large apparatus such as an atomic force microscope can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this viewpoint, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.

==Nanorobotics theory==
According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a &quot;medical&quot; use for Feynman&#x27;s theoretical micro-machines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) &quot;swallow the surgeon&quot;. The idea was incorporated into Feynman&#x27;s case study 1959 essay &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.&quot;

Since nano-robots would be microscopic in size, it would probably be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks. These nano-robot swarms, both those unable to replicate (as in utility fog) and those able to replicate unconstrained in the natural environment (as in grey goo and synthetic biology), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the Borg nano-probes in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;The New Breed&quot;.

Some proponents of nano-robotics, in reaction to the grey goo scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nano-robots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, were it ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.

A detailed theoretical discussion of nanorobotics, including specific design issues such as sensing, power communication, navigation, manipulation, locomotion, and onboard computation, has been presented in the medical context of nanomedicine by Robert Freitas. Some of these discussions remain at the level of unbuildable generality and do not approach the level of detailed engineering.

==Legal and ethical implications==

===Open technology===
A document with a proposal on nanobiotech development using open design technology methods, as in open-source hardware and open-source software, has been addressed to the United Nations General Assembly. According to the document sent to the United Nations, in the same way that open source has in recent years accelerated the development of computer systems, a similar approach should benefit the society at large and accelerate nanorobotics development. The use of nanobiotechnology should be established as a human heritage for the coming generations, and developed as an open technology based on ethical practices for peaceful purposes. Open technology is stated as a fundamental key for such an aim.

===Nanorobot race===
In the same ways that technology research and development drove the space race and nuclear arms race, a race for nanorobots is occurring. There is plenty of ground allowing nanorobots to be included among the emerging technologies. Some of the reasons are that large corporations, such as General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Synopsys, Northrop Grumman and Siemens have been recently working in the development and research of nanorobots; surgeons are getting involved and starting to propose ways to apply nanorobots for common medical procedures; universities and research institutes were granted funds by government agencies exceeding $2 billion towards research developing nanodevices for medicine; bankers are also strategically investing with the intent to acquire beforehand rights and royalties on future nanorobots commercialisation. Some aspects of nanorobot litigation and related issues linked to monopoly have already arisen. A large number of patents have been granted recently on nanorobots, mostly by patent agents, companies specializing solely on building patent portfolios, and lawyers. After a long series of patents and eventually litigations, see for example the invention of radio, or the war of currents, emerging fields of technology tend to become a monopoly, which normally is dominated by large corporations.

==Approaches to manufacturing ==

Manufacturing nanomachines assembled from molecular components is a very challenging task. Because of the level of difficulty, many engineers and scientists continue working cooperatively across multidisciplinary approaches to achieve breakthroughs in this new area of development. Thus, it is quite understandable the importance of the following distinct techniques currently applied towards manufacturing nanorobots:

===Biochip===

The joint use of nanoelectronics, photolithography, and new biomaterials provides a possible approach to manufacturing nanorobots for common medical uses, such as surgical instrumentation, diagnosis, and drug delivery. This method for manufacturing on nanotechnology scale is in use in the electronics industry since 2008. So, practical nanorobots should be integrated as nanoelectronics devices, which will allow tele-operation and advanced capabilities for medical instrumentation.

===Nubots===
A &quot;nucleic acid robot&quot; (nubot) is an organic molecular machine at the nanoscale. DNA structure can provide means to assemble 2D and 3D nanomechanical devices. DNA based machines can be activated using small molecules, proteins and other molecules of DNA. Biological circuit gates based on DNA materials have been engineered as molecular machines to allow in-vitro drug delivery for targeted health problems. Such material based systems would work most closely to smart biomaterial drug system delivery, while not allowing precise in vivo teleoperation of such engineered prototypes.

===Surface-bound systems===
Several reports have demonstrated the attachment of synthetic molecular motors to surfaces. These primitive nanomachines have been shown to undergo machine-like motions when confined to the surface of a macroscopic material. The surface anchored motors could potentially be used to move and position nanoscale materials on a surface in the manner of a conveyor belt.

===Positional nanoassembly===
Nanofactory Collaboration, founded by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in 2000 and involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries, focuses on developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at developing positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and a diamondoid nanofactory that would have the capability of building diamondoid medical nanorobots.

===Biohybrids===
The emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Thiol-ene e-beams resist allow the direct writing of nanoscale features, followed by the functionalization of the natively reactive resist surface with biomolecules. Other approaches use a biodegradable material attached to magnetic particles that allow them to be guided around the body.

===Bacteria-based===
This approach proposes the use of biological microorganisms, like the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;. Thus the model uses a flagellum for propulsion purposes. Electromagnetic fields normally control the motion of this kind of biological integrated device. Chemists at the University of Nebraska have created a humidity gauge by fusing a bacterium to a silicon computer chip.

===Virus-based===
Retroviruses can be retrained to attach to cells and replace DNA. They go through a process called reverse transcription to deliver genetic packaging in a vector. Usually, these devices are Pol – Gag genes of the virus for the Capsid and Delivery system. This process is called retroviral gene therapy, having the ability to re-engineer cellular DNA by usage of viral vectors. This approach has appeared in the form of retroviral, adenoviral, and lentiviral gene delivery systems. These gene therapy vectors have been used in cats to send genes into the genetically modified organism (GMO), causing it to display the trait.

==Magnetic helical nanorobots==
Research has led to the creation of helical silica particles coated with magnetic materials that can be maneuvered using a rotating magnetic field. 

Such nanorobots are not dependent on chemical reactions to fuel the propulsion. A triaxial Helmholtz coil can provide directed rotating field in space. It was shown how such nanomotors can be used to measure viscosity of non-newtonian fluids at a resolution of a few microns. This technology promises creation of viscosity map inside cells and the extracellular milieu. Such nanorobots have been demonstrated to move in blood. Researchers have managed to controllably move such nanorobots inside cancer cells allowing them to trace out patterns inside a cell. Nanorobots moving through the tumor microenvironment have demonstrated the presence of sialic acid in the cancer-secreted extracellular matrix.

===Summary of helical nanorobots===

A magnetic helical nanorobot consists of at least two components - one being a helical body, and the other being a magnetic material. The helical body provides a structure to the nanorobot capable of translation along the helical axis. The magnetic material, on the other hand, allows the structure to rotate by following an externally applied rotating magnetic field. Not only do magnetic helical nanorobots take advantage of magnetic actuation, but they also take advantage of helical propulsion methods.

In short, magnetic helical nanorobots translate a rotational motion into translational movement through a fluid in low Reynolds number environments. These nanorobots have been inspired by naturally occurring microorganisms such as flagella, cilia, and Escheric coli (otherwise known as E. coli) which rotate in a helical wave. 

===Movement of magnetic helical nanorobots===

One approach to the wireless manipulation of helical swimmers is through externally applied gradient rotation magnetic field. This can be done through Helmholtz coil as the helical swimmers are actuated by a rotating magnetic field. All magnetized objects within an externally imposed magnetic field will have both forces and torques exerted on them. The helical swimmers can rotate due the magnetic field received by the magnetic head and the forces acting upon it. Once the whole structure feels the field then the helical shape of its body converts this rotational movement into a propulsive force. Magnetic forces (fm) are proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field (∇B) on the magnetized object, and act to move the object to local maxima. Also, magnetic torques (τ) are proportional to the magnetic field (B) and act to align the internal magnetization of an object (M) with the field. The equations that express the interactions are as follows where V is the volume of the magnetized object.

formula_1 (Equation 1)

formula_2 (Equation 2)

Equation one indicates that, increasing the volume of the magnetic material will increase the force experienced by the material proportionally. If the volume is doubled, the force will also double, assuming the magnetization (M) and the gradient of the magnetic field (∇B) remain constant. This would be the same for the torque of the magnetic material too since it is proportional to the volume.

This increase in magnetic dipoles enhances the overall magnetic response of the material to an external magnetic field, resulting in greater force and torque. Hence when the magnetic material gets bigger than the helical swimmer can move faster.

===Movement of a helical swimmer with square magnetic head===

To use the rotation magnetic field, a permanent magnet can be planted in the helical swimmer’s head, whose magnetization direction would be perpendicular to the swimmer body. When a rotating magnetic field is applied, the swimmer’s head experiences a magnetic torque, causing it to rotate. The helical shape converts this rotational movement into a propulsive force. As the swimmer’s head rotates, its helical tail generates a force against the surrounding fluid, propelling it forward. According to equation 2, the magnetic torque around the &quot;x&quot;-axis is zero 

formula_3

at the initial position. After the magnet manipulator turns 45°, the magnetic field near the head position of the square magnet turns at an angle around the &quot;x&quot;-axis, as shown in

the figure below. If the square magnet stays in its initial position, it will be subject to a magnetic torque around the &quot;x&quot;-axis 

formula_4

Thus, the helical swimmer will follow the magnetic field. If the magnet manipulator rotates one turn, the magnetic field near the head position of the swimmer projected on the plane &quot;yoz&quot; rotates a whole turn around the x-axis. This results in the helical shape to move, resulting in propulsion as follows: 

formula_5

This propulsion helps the helical structure to rotate with the angle of the force. As a result, the magnetic robot rotates around the &quot;x&quot;-axis by the action of the rotating magnetic field. 

===Example biomedical applications===

Due to its small scale and helical shape providing propulsion, helical swimmers can be used in some biomedical applications such as; targeted drug delivery and targeted cell delivery. In 2018, there was a proposed biocompatible and biodegradable chistosan-based helical micro/nanoswimmer loaded with doxorubicin (DOX), a common anticancer drug that was designed to deliver its payload to a desired location. Using 3.4 × 10–1 W/cm2 intensity UV light radiation, when the swimmer approached the target location, a dose of 60% of the total DOX was released within 5 minutes. However, it was seen that the dosage release rate slowed down after the initial 5 minutes that were reported. This was theorized to be caused by a decreasing diffusion rate of DOX molecules coming from the center of the swimmer. Another group’s spirulina-based helical micro/nanoswimmer also carrying DOX used a different method for controlled drug release. Once the swimmer had reached its destination, near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation was used to heat up the location to dissolve the swimmer into individual particles, releasing the drug in the process. Through multiple tests, it was found that weak acidic external environments led to an increase in the dosage release rate. 

Using magnetic helical micro/nanorobots for cell transport can also lead to opportunities in solving male infertility, repairing damaged tissue, and cell assembly. In 2015, a helical micro-/nanomotor with a holding ring on the head was used to successfully capture and transport sperm cells with motion deficiencies. The helix device would approach the sperm cell’s tail and confine it with the body of the micro-/nanomotor. It would then use the holding ring to loosely capture the head of the sperm cell to prevent escape. After reaching the target location, the sperm cell would be released into the membrane of the oocyte by reversing the rotation of the helix device. This strategy was considered to be an efficient strategy while also reducing risk of damage to the sperm cells.

===3D printing===
3D printing is the process by which a three-dimensional structure is built through the various processes of additive manufacturing. Nanoscale 3D printing involves many of the same process, incorporated at a much smaller scale. To print a structure in the 5-400 μm scale, the precision of the 3D printing machine needs to be improved greatly. A two-step process of 3D printing, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique. To be more precise at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches the details needed for the segments of nanorobots into each plate. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up.

This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process. Second, it has the potential to create functional segments of a nanorobot. The 3D printer uses a liquid resin, which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam. The focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by movable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer, just a few hundred nanometers wide. This fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand. This process takes place by using photoactive resins, which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure. This process is quick by nanoscale 3D printing standards. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. This approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3D object into a block of gel. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100 nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.

== Challenges in designing nanorobots ==
There are number of challenges and problems that should be addressed when designing and building nanoscale machines with movable parts. The most obvious one is the need of developing very fine tools and manipulation techniques capable of assembling individual nanostructures with high precision into operational device. Less evident challenge is related to peculiarities of adhesion and friction on nanoscale. It is impossible to take existing design of macroscopic device with movable parts and just reduce it to the nanoscale. Such approach will not work due to high surface energy of nanostructures, which means that all contacting parts will stick together following the energy minimization principle. The adhesion and static friction between parts can easily exceed the strength of materials, so the parts will break before they start to move relative to each other. This leads to the need to design movable structures with minimal contact area [].

In spite of the fast development of nanorobots, most of the nanorobots designed for drug delivery purposes, there is &quot;still a long way to go before their commercialization and clinical applications can be achieved.&quot;

==Potential uses==
===Nanomedicine===
Potential uses for nanorobotics in medicine include early diagnosis and targeted drug-delivery for cancer, biomedical instrumentation, surgery, pharmacokinetics, monitoring of diabetes, and health care.

In such plans, future medical nanotechnology is expected to employ nanorobots injected into the patient to perform work at a cellular level. Such nanorobots intended for use in medicine should be non-replicating, as replication would needlessly increase device complexity, reduce reliability, and interfere with the medical mission.

Nanotechnology provides a wide range of new technologies for developing customized means to optimize the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs. Today, harmful side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy are commonly a result of drug delivery methods that don&#x27;t pinpoint their intended target cells accurately. Researchers at Harvard and MIT, however, have been able to attach special RNA strands, measuring nearly 10 nm in diameter, to nanoparticles, filling them with a chemotherapy drug. These RNA strands are attracted to cancer cells. When the nanoparticle encounters a cancer cell, it adheres to it, and releases the drug into the cancer cell. This directed method of drug delivery has great potential for treating cancer patients while avoiding negative effects (commonly associated with improper drug delivery). The first demonstration of nanomotors operating in living organisms was carried out in 2014 at University of California, San Diego. MRI-guided nanocapsules are one potential precursor to nanorobots.

Another useful application of nanorobots is assisting in the repair of tissue cells alongside white blood cells. Recruiting inflammatory cells or white blood cells (which include neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and mast cells) to the affected area is the first response of tissues to injury. Because of their small size, nanorobots could attach themselves to the surface of recruited white cells, to squeeze their way out through the walls of blood vessels and arrive at the injury site, where they can assist in the tissue repair process. Certain substances could possibly be used to accelerate the recovery.

The science behind this mechanism is quite complex. Passage of cells across the blood endothelium, a process known as transmigration, is a mechanism involving engagement of cell surface receptors to adhesion molecules, active force exertion and dilation of the vessel walls and physical deformation of the migrating cells. By attaching themselves to migrating inflammatory cells, the robots can in effect &quot;hitch a ride&quot; across the blood vessels, bypassing the need for a complex transmigration mechanism of their own.

, in the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates nanotechnology on the basis of size.

Nanocomposite particles that are controlled remotely by an electromagnetic field was also developed. This series of nanorobots that are now enlisted in the Guinness World Records, can be used to interact with the biological cells. Scientists suggest that this technology can be used for the treatment of cancer.

Magnetic nanorobots have demonstrated capabilities to prevent and treat antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Application of nanomotor implants have been proposed to achieve thorough disinfection of the dentine.

===Cultural references===
The Nanites are characters on the TV show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. They&#x27;re self-replicating, bio-engineered organisms that work on the ship and reside in the SOL&#x27;s computer systems. They made their first appearance in Season 8.

Nanites are used in a number of episodes in the television series &quot;Travelers&quot;. They be programmed and injected into injured people to perform repairs, and first appear in season 1.

Nanites also feature in the 2016 expansion for the video game &quot;Destiny&quot; in which SIVA, a self-replicating nanotechnology is used as a weapon.

Nanites (referred to more often as nanomachines) are often referenced in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, being used to enhance and regulate abilities and body functions.

In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise TV shows nanites play an important plot device. Starting with &quot;Evolution&quot; in the third season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Borg Nanoprobes perform the function of maintaining the Borg cybernetic systems, as well as repairing damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed, as well as protecting them from many forms of disease.

Nanites play a role in the &quot;Deus Ex&quot; video game series, being the basis of the nano-augmentation technology which gives augmented people superhuman abilities.

Nanites are also mentioned in the Arc of a Scythe book series by Neal Shusterman and are used to heal all nonfatal injuries, regulate bodily functions, and considerably lessen pain.

Nanites are also an integral part of &quot;Stargate SG1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, where grey goo scenarios are portrayed.

Nanomachines are central to the plot of the &quot;Silo&quot; book series, in which they are used as a weapon of mass destruction propagated via the air, and enter undetected into the human body where, when receiving a signal, they kill the recipient. They are then used to wipe out the majority of the human race.

<text>Alan Leonard Hunt (7 February 1942 – 14 March 2007), known as Gareth Hunt, was a British television actor best remembered for playing footman Frederick Norton in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and Mike Gambit in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;.

==Early life==
Alan Leonard Hunt was born in Battersea, London, in 1942. His father was killed in the Second World War when he was two years old, and he was brought up by his mother, Doris, and his stepfather. At the age of 15, he joined the Merchant Navy. After six years, he jumped ship in New Zealand and worked in a car plant for a year before he was caught and served three months in a military prison. Hunt was then deported back to Britain, and while taking a BBC design course he held a variety of jobs, including stagehand, road digger, butcher&#x27;s assistant and door-to-door salesman. Having had an interest in acting since his early years, he subsequently trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. Following that, he did rep across the United Kingdom and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre in the early 1970s. Among the many stage productions he appeared in were &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

==Career==
Hunt began his television career in 1968, playing Private Kitson in one episode of the UK series &quot;Frontier&quot;. In 1972, he played a policeman in &quot;For the Love of Ada&quot;, the same year he appeared in &quot;A Family at War&quot; and &quot;The Organisation&quot;. In 1974, he had roles in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; and &quot;Bless This House&quot;, and the following year played Thomas Woolner in &quot;The Love School&quot;.

In 1974, Hunt appeared in the &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; episode &quot;Missing Believed Killed&quot; as Trooper Norton, batman to James Bellamy. The character was a minor one; however, his performance led producers John Hawkesworth and Alfred Shaughnessy to ask him to come back as a regular for the fifth series in 1975. Hunt continued playing Frederick Norton, who had by now become the footman, until the eleventh episode of the fifth series, &quot;Alberto&quot;.

In 1975, he made appearances in &quot;The Hanged Man&quot;, &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 1976, the year after leaving &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, Hunt starred alongside Joanna Lumley and Patrick Macnee in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers said Hunt was cast because of his part in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. He played secret agent Mike Gambit and starred in the show until its end after two series in December 1977. 

In 1979 he appeared in the films &quot;Licensed to Love and Kill&quot;, in which he portrayed secret agent Charles Bind, and &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot;. During the late 1970s and 1980s Hunt made appearances in &quot;Sunday Night Thriller&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot; and &quot;Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense&quot;. He appeared alongside Julia McKenzie in &quot;That Beryl Marston...!&quot; in 1981, and also in the films &quot;Funny Money&quot; (1983) and &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot; (1984) as well as the children&#x27;s film &quot;Gabrielle and the Doodleman&quot;. In 1988 he played many parts in the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; film &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.

Hunt starred in a series of television adverts for the instant coffee brand Nescafé in the 1980s, with a trademark move: to shake his closed hand then open it, to reveal coffee beans, and smell the aroma. He also starred in a Territorial Army recruitment film titled &quot;One of Us&quot;, set in the early 1980s. In it, he plays a Corporal Barrett; the story concerns a small anti-tank platoon from the 3rd Battalion (V) Royal Regiment of Wales going to Germany on exercises. The unit in question was located in the village of Pentre, Rhondda Fawr, South Wales. Like many other TA units it no longer exists.

From 1992 to 1993 Hunt had a leading role in the sitcom &quot;Side by Side&quot;.

Hunt continued to have minor roles in many television programmes in the 1990s and 2000s, with appearances in &quot;The New Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Harry and the Wrinklies&quot;, &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (as himself), &quot;New Tricks&quot;, &quot;Sooty &amp; Co.&quot;, &quot;Powers&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;. He appeared in the TV movie &quot;The Incredible Adventures of Marco Polo&quot; and the films &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; (1997), &quot;Parting Shots&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Riddle&quot; (2007), and in 2001 played Ritchie Stringer, a crime boss who was an unlikely suspect in the shooting of Phil Mitchell, in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. He had a main role in the short-lived soap opera &quot;Night and Day&quot; in 2001.

For a brief time he abandoned acting and started a project called Interactive Casting Universal, a computer system that presented actors&#x27; details and showreels.

Hunt suffered a heart attack in December 1999, and withdrew from a pantomime in Malvern. In July 2002, he collapsed while performing on stage in Bournemouth.

==Death==
Hunt died of pancreatic cancer, from which he had suffered for two years, on 14 March 2007 at the age of 65, at his home in Redhill, Surrey. He was married three times and had a son by each marriage. His last wife, Amanda, is the mother of his youngest son, Jason.

<text>The scuppernong is a large variety of muscadine (&quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot;), a species of grape native to the southern United States. It is usually a greenish or bronze color and is similar in appearance and texture to a white grape, but rounder and larger. 

First known as the &quot;big white grape&quot;, the grape is commonly known as the &quot;scuplin&quot; in some areas of the Deep South and also as the &quot;scufalum&quot;, &quot;scupanon&quot;, &quot;scupadine&quot;, &quot;scuppernine&quot;, &quot;scupnun&quot;, or &quot;scufadine&quot; in other parts of the South. The scuppernong is the state fruit of North Carolina.

==History==

The name comes from the Scuppernong River in North Carolina mainly along the coastal plain. It was first mentioned as a &quot;white grape&quot; in a written logbook by the Florentine explorer Giovanni de Verrazzano while exploring the Cape Fear River Valley in 1524. He wrote of &quot;...[m]any vines growing naturally there...&quot;. Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s explorers, the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, wrote in 1584 that North Carolina&#x27;s coast was &quot;...so full of grapes as the very beating and surge of the sea overflowed them...in all the world, the like abundance is not to be found.&quot; 

He may have been referring to Sargasso seaweed from coral reefs, which can be seen washed up on shore after a major storm off the North Carolina coast. The seaweed has berrylike gas-filled bladders looking much like grapes to keep the fronds afloat. 

However, in 1585, Governor Ralph Lane, when describing North Carolina to Raleigh, stated: &quot;We have discovered the main to be the goodliest soil under the cope of heaven, so abounding with sweet trees that bring rich and pleasant, grapes of such greatness, yet wild, as France, Spain, nor Italy hath no greater...&quot;.

The Scuppernong grape was first cultivated during the 17th century, particularly in Tyrell County, North Carolina. Isaac Alexander found it while hunting along the banks of a stream feeding into Scuppernong Lake in 1755; it is mentioned in the North Carolina official state toast. The name itself traces back to the Algonquian word &quot;ascopo&quot;, meaning &quot;sweet bay tree&quot;.

==Cultivation==

The fruit grows where temperatures seldom fall below . Injury or freeze can occur where winter temperatures drop below . Some cultivars, such as &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Carlos&quot;, and &quot;Sterling&quot; will survive north to Virginia and west to the Blue Ridge Mountains foothills. Nonetheless, Muscadines have a high tolerance to diseases and pests; more than 100 years of breeding has resulted in several bronze cultivars, such as &quot;Doreen&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot;, in addition to the aforementioned &quot;Carlos&quot; and &quot;Magnolia’&quot;. All are distinguishable from the Scuppernong variety by being perfect-flowered (male and female flower parts together). The Scuppernong possesses only female flowering parts.

==The &quot;Mother Vine&quot;==
Possibly the oldest cultivated grapevine in the world is the 400-year-old scuppernong &quot;Mother Vine&quot; growing on Roanoke Island, North Carolina.

== Use of scuppernong in the arts ==

=== In music ===
&quot;Scuppernong&quot; is a piece for piano in three movements by John Wesley Work III.

&quot;Broomstraw Philosophers and Scuppernong Wine&quot; is a song written by country artist, Larry Jon Wilson.

=== In literature ===
Scuppernongs are mentioned in chapters 4, 5, and 22 of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

Scuppernongs are also mentioned in Charles W. Chesnutt&#x27;s 1899 collection of short stories &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot;. 

They are also mentioned by the name &quot;scupadine&quot; in chapter 6 of &quot;Salvage the Bones&quot;.

&quot;In the Scuppernongs&quot; is the title of a chapter in &quot;Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone&quot;, the ninth book in the &quot;Outlander&quot; series by Diana Gabaldon.

In the movie &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, Rhoda Penmark talks about the &quot;Scuppernong arbor&quot; in the family&#x27;s yard. In William Faulkner&#x27;s novel Absalom, Absalom!, Thomas Sutpen, and Wash Jones drink whiskey and laugh together in the Scuppernong arbor on Sutpen&#x27;s estate.

Scuppernongs are mentioned in Chapter 25 of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Civil War novel &quot;Andersonville&quot;.

<text>A pinion is a round gear—usually the smaller of two meshed gears—used in several applications, including drivetrain and rack and pinion systems.

== Applications ==
=== Drivetrain ===
Drivetrains usually feature a gear known as the pinion, which may vary in different systems, including

* the typically smaller gear in a gear drive train (although in the first commercially successful steam locomotive—the &quot;Salamanca&quot;—the &quot;pinion&quot; was rather large). In many cases, such as remote controlled toys, the pinion is also the drive gear for a reduction in speed, since electric motors operate at higher speed and lower torque than desirable at the wheels. However the reverse is true in watches, where gear trains commence with a high-torque, low-speed spring and terminate in the fast-and-weak escapement.
* the smaller gear that drives in a 90-degree angle towards a crown gear in a differential drive.
* the small front sprocket on a chain driven motorcycle.
*the clutch bell gear when paired with a centrifugal clutch, in radio-controlled cars with an engine (e.g., nitro).

=== Rack and pinion ===
In rack and pinion systems, the pinion is the round gear that engages and moves along the linear rack.

<doc id="1006647" wikidata="Q482202" url="?curid=1006647" title="Adam Carson">
<text>Adam Alexander Carson (born February 5, 1975) is the drummer of the alternative rock band AFI. He and Davey Havok are the two original members left in the lineup. Carson also filled in as drummer for the psychobilly band Tiger Army. His drumming can be found on Tiger Army&#x27;s &quot;Early Years EP&quot; as well as their debut album &quot;Tiger Army&quot;. Carson was also a member of Influence 13 – a band formed by Nick 13, Jade Puget (who joined AFI in 1998), Geoff Kresge (who left AFI in 1996), and two other friends.

==Biography==
Adam Carson was raised in Ukiah, California, along with fellow AFI members Davey Havok and Jade Puget, and former members Geoff Kresge and Mark Stopholese. AFI has been described as a Bay Area band that is &quot;one of the top hardcore/post-punk acts in the San Francisco Bay Area.&quot; Carson acquired an interest in music as early as age three, by which time he had amassed a small collection of 45-rpm records. As a toddler, Carson would also drag pots and pans out of his kitchen and assemble them into a drum set. 

Carson&#x27;s aspirations to be a drummer in a band were realized when he was eight or nine years old. He recalls, &quot;I came home from the record store with Def Leppard&#x27;s Pyromania, as well as a poster of them performing live. I remember listening to the record and looking at the poster on my wall and thinking that being in a rock band must be the best thing ever.&quot;

Carson played in his school band when he was in the sixth and seventh grade. Regarding his experience, he said, &quot;I played the drums (surprise, surprise) and had hot pink drumsticks and thought I was totally rad. I thought because I owned a drum set and could play a rock beat that I knew everything there was to know. I got sent to the office a lot for messing around with the trombone players, and when we had substitutes I organized mass switching of instruments by the class. I think I ended up with a tuba at one point.&quot; However, he also believes his time in the band was misused, stating &quot;I kind of wish I had paid more attention because I can&#x27;t read music and know very little about scales and that type of thing. I quit band when the teacher called me a flake. I think he was pissed because I didn&#x27;t want to join marching band, and I was pissed because he turned me down for jazz band and they had a drum kit. Even though I was a screw-up, I think being in the school band was educational and affected me positively.&quot;

Adam Carson met future bandmate Davey Havok in the fifth grade. It was not until high school that the two became friends and started AFI. While still in high school, Davey Havok, Mark Stopholese, and Vic Chalker formed AFI in November 1991. Stopholese suggested his friend, who was Adam Carson, to be drummer since he owned a drum set. Chalker was soon replaced by Geoff Kresge, and AFI subsequently recorded their debut EP, &quot;Dork&quot;. Regarding the first AFI practice, Carson recalls: &quot;The first practice was pretty funny because no one knew how to play at all. I remember my dad was in the garage and spent like an hour trying to get the bass and guitar in tune. We didn&#x27;t even know how to tune anything. I think we tried to play Angry Samoans and Germs covers. There really wasn&#x27;t any chemistry at that time—it came a little later.&quot;

AFI briefly split in 1993 after each of its members graduated high school and attended different colleges. Carson attended UC Santa Cruz, while Havok and Stopholese attended the UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California (USC), respectively. In December of that year, the band reunited and played a show for approximately 200 fans at the Phoenix Theater in Petaluma, California. Encouraged by their enjoyment and success at the show, AFI became a full-time band.

On August 3, 2013, Carson married British model Eirinie Hamil. The couple have two daughters together, Luka Lily Carson, born on April 22, 2017, and Selah Marigold Carson, born on April 17, 2021.

==Career==

Between 1993 and 1995 AFI released several vinyl EPs (&quot;Behind the Times; Eddie Picnic&#x27;s All Wet; This Is Berkeley, Not West Bay; AFI/Heckle; Bombing the Bay; Fly in the Ointment&quot;) independently.

Their first full-length, &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot; was released August 11, 1995, on Wingnut Records, and was produced by Tim Armstrong. AFI were soon after signed on to Nitro Records, Dexter Holland of The Offspring&#x27;s label, and released &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot;, their second album. Carson is the one who conceived the album title and has written the lyrics for the song &quot;Key Lime Pie,&quot; (a tribute to one of his favorite foods) and contributed several lines to &quot;Rizzo in the Box.&quot;.

After several tours in support of the album &quot;Very Proud of Ya,&quot; Kresge decided to leave the group. His spot was filled by Hunter Burgan for the remaining &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot; tour dates. Burgan went on to help AFI record &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot; (1997) and was invited to become the full-time bassist.

After recording the &quot;A Fire Inside EP&quot; (1998), Stopholese left the band and was replaced by Jade Puget, former member of Influence 13 and vocalist Havok&#x27;s close friend. The band then recorded &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; (1999), a musical turning point which introduced AFI fans to a much darker sound, mixing the band&#x27;s original hardcore roots with dark romantic influences.

The &quot;All Hallows EP&quot; (October 5, 1999) explored the horror punk genre touched upon on &quot;Black Sails&quot;, featuring artwork and lyrics containing Halloween themes. The EP spawned the single &quot;Totalimmortal&quot;, a track later covered by The Offspring for the &quot;Me, Myself and Irene&quot; soundtrack. It received a fair amount of radio play and exposed AFI to larger audiences.

Carson played drums on the psychobilly band Tiger Army&#x27;s debut album &quot;Tiger Army&quot;. Bandmate Davey Havok and Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong also contributed backing vocals to the album. The album was released on October 26, 1999.

On September 19, 2000, AFI released &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;, which debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number 174, and peaked at number 9 on the Heatseekers chart. It continued to touch base with the horror punk genre, but expanded into styles that were a departure from previous works. The album brought the band unprecedented success in the underground scene, selling in excess of 100,000 copies. &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot; was released as a single and video and had some moderate mainstream success, garnering the band more TV and radio airplay.

In 2002, AFI left Nitro Records. A&amp;R Luke Wood signed them to DreamWorks Records. Their first album for the label, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, was released in 2003. The songs &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot;, &quot;The Leaving Song Pt. II&quot;, and &quot;Silver and Cold&quot; had some &quot;Billboard&quot; chart success and exposed the band to even larger audiences. They were nominated in the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for the MTV2 award category for the &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; video, which came to be their first VMA.

In June 2006, AFI&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Decemberunderground&quot;, was released on Interscope Records. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Miss Murder&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Charts. The release reflected the continually changing and growing fan base of the band, and the album debuted as No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies of the album.

AFI&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Crash Love&quot;, was released on September 29, 2009. The first single from the album, &quot;Medicate&quot;, was released on August 25, 2009, and reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs Chart. The album yielded a second single, &quot;Beautiful Thieves&quot;, which peaked at No. 23. The album was very well received by critics.

AFI&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Burials&quot;, was released on October 22, 2013. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Hope You Suffer&quot; was released July 22, 2013, followed by the release of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;17 Crimes&quot; on August 6, 2013.

Carson is involved in a new band called The Reckless Kind (formed in 2011), described as &quot;A 5 piece, heavy soul band.&quot; They recently finished recording their debut album, and have played several shows.

<doc id="1006649" wikidata="Q223706" url="?curid=1006649" title="Nome (Egypt)">
<text>A nome (, from , &quot;nomós&quot;, &quot;district&quot;) was a territorial division in ancient Egypt. 

Each nome was ruled by a nomarch (, &quot;Great Chief&quot;). The number of nomes changed through the various periods of the history of ancient Egypt.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;nome&quot; comes from Ancient Greek &quot;nomós&quot; meaning &quot;pasture&quot; extended to &quot;dwelling&quot; and &quot;district&quot;; the Ancient Egyptian term was ( /sɛpɑt/). Today&#x27;s use of the Ancient Greek rather than the Ancient Egyptian term came about during the Ptolemaic period, when the use of Greek was widespread in Egypt. The availability of Greek records on Egypt influenced the adoption of Greek terms by later historians.

==History==
===Dynastic Egypt===

The division of ancient Egypt into nomes can be traced back to prehistoric Egypt (before 3100 BC). These nomes originally existed as autonomous city-states, but later began to unify. According to ancient tradition, the ruler Menes completed the final unification.

Not only did the division into nomes remain in place for more than three millennia, the areas of the individual nomes and their ordering remained remarkably stable. Some, like Xois in the Nile Delta or Khent in Upper Egypt, were first mentioned on the Palermo Stone, which was inscribed in the Fifth Dynasty. The names of a few, like the nome of Bubastis, appeared no earlier than the New Kingdom. Under the system that prevailed for most of pharaonic Egypt&#x27;s history, the country was divided into 42 nomes.

====Lower Egypt nomes====

Lower Egypt (Egyptian: &quot;Ā-meḥty&quot;), from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea, comprised 20 nomes. The first was based around Memphis, Saqqara, and Giza, in the area occupied by modern-day Cairo. The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile Delta, first covering the territory on the west before continuing with the higher numbers to the east. Thus, Alexandria was in the Third Nome; Bubastis was in the Eighteenth.

#White Walls Nome 
#Travellers land
#Cattle land 
#Southern shield land 
#Northern shield land 
#Mountain bull land 
#West harpoon land 
#East harpoon land 
#Andjety god land 
#Black bull land 
#Heseb bull land
#Calf and Cow land 
#Prospering Sceptre land 
#Eastmost land
#Ibis-Tehut land
#Fish land
#The throne land 
#Prince of the South land 
#Prince of the North land
#Sopdu-Plumed Falcon land

====Upper Egypt nomes====

Upper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes. The first of these was centered on Elephantine close to Egypt&#x27;s border with Nubia at the First Cataract – the area of modern-day Aswan. From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley. Waset (ancient Thebes or contemporary Luxor) was in the Fourth Nome, Amarna in the Fourteenth, and Meidum in the Twenty-first.
#Bows land
#Throne of Horus land
#Shrine land
#Sceptre land
#The two falcons land
#The crocodile land 
#Sistrum land
#The Great land
#Min-God land
#Cobra land 
#Sha-Set animal land
#Viper mountain land
#Upper Sycamore and Viper land
#Lower Sycamore and Viper land
#Hares land 
#Oryx Nome 
#Anubis land 
#Set land 
#Two Sceptres land
#Southern Sycamore land 
#Northern Sycamore land
#Knife land

===Ptolemaic Egypt===

Some nomes were added or renamed during the Graeco-Roman occupation of Egypt. For example, the Ptolemies renamed the Crocodilopolitan nome to Arsinoe. Hadrian created a new nome, Antinoopolites, for which Antinoöpolis was the capital.

====Roman Egypt====

The nomes survived into Roman times. Under Roman rule, individual nomes minted their own coinage, the so-called &quot;nome coins&quot;, which still reflect individual local associations and traditions. The nomes of Egypt retained their primary importance as administrative units until the fundamental rearrangement of the bureaucracy during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine the Great.

From AD 307/8, their place was taken by smaller units called &quot;pagi&quot;. Eventually powerful local officials arose who were called pagarchs, through whom all patronage flowed. The pagarch&#x27;s essential role was as an organizer of tax-collection. Later the pagarch assumed some military functions as well. The pagarchs were often wealthy landowners who reigned over the &quot;pagi&quot; from which they originated.

==Nomarch==

For most of the history, each nome was headed by a nomarch. The position of the nomarch was at times hereditary, while at others they were appointed by the pharaoh. Generally, when the national government was stronger, nomarchs were the king&#x27;s appointed governors. When the central government was weaker, however—such as during foreign invasions or civil wars—individual nomes would assert themselves and establish hereditary lines of succession. Conflicts among these different hereditary nomarchies were common, most notably during the First Intermediate Period, a time that saw a breakdown in central authority lasting from the 7th–11th Dynasties which ended when one of the local rulers became strong enough to again assert control over the entire country as pharaoh.

==List of nomes==
The nomes ( , ) are listed in separate tables for &quot;Isti&quot; - &quot;the two Egypts&quot; (Upper and Lower Egypt).

Note: 

# older or other variants of the name in square brackets &#x27;[ ]&#x27;;
# names vary from different time or era, or even titles, most epithets, honorific titles with a slash &#x27;/&#x27;;
#Greek-Egypto derived names from the original Egyptian in parentheses &#x27;()&#x27;

<doc id="1006651" wikidata="Q798012" url="?curid=1006651" title="Amorphous carbon">
<text>Amorphous carbon is free, reactive carbon that has no crystalline structure. Amorphous carbon materials may be stabilized by terminating dangling-π bonds with hydrogen. As with other amorphous solids, some short-range order can be observed. Amorphous carbon is often abbreviated to &quot;aC&quot; for general amorphous carbon, &quot;aC:H&quot; or &quot;HAC&quot; for hydrogenated amorphous carbon, or to &quot;ta-C&quot; for tetrahedral amorphous carbon (also called diamond-like carbon).

== In mineralogy ==

In mineralogy, amorphous carbon is the name used for coal, carbide-derived carbon, and other impure forms of carbon that are neither graphite nor diamond. In a crystallographic sense, however, the materials are not truly amorphous but rather polycrystalline materials of graphite or diamond within an amorphous carbon matrix. Commercial carbon also usually contains significant quantities of other elements, which may also form crystalline impurities.

== In modern science ==

With the development of modern thin film deposition and growth techniques in the latter half of the 20th century, such as chemical vapour deposition, sputter deposition, and cathodic arc deposition, it became possible to fabricate truly amorphous carbon materials.

True amorphous carbon has localized π electrons (as opposed to the aromatic π bonds in graphite), and its bonds form with lengths and distances that are inconsistent with any other allotrope of carbon. It also contains a high concentration of dangling bonds; these cause deviations in interatomic spacing (as measured using diffraction) of more than 5% as well as noticeable variation in bond angle.

The properties of amorphous carbon films vary depending on the parameters used during deposition. The primary method for characterizing amorphous carbon is through the ratio of &quot;sp&quot;2 to &quot;sp&quot;3 hybridized bonds present in the material. Graphite consists purely of &quot;sp&quot;2 hybridized bonds, whereas diamond consists purely of &quot;sp&quot;3 hybridized bonds. Materials that are high in &quot;sp&quot;3 hybridized bonds are referred to as tetrahedral amorphous carbon, owing to the tetrahedral shape formed by &quot;sp&quot;3 hybridized bonds, or as diamond-like carbon (owing to the similarity of many physical properties to those of diamond).

Experimentally, sp2 to sp3 ratios can be determined by comparing the relative intensities of various spectroscopic peaks (including EELS, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy) to those expected for graphite or diamond. In theoretical works, the &quot;sp&quot;2 to &quot;sp&quot;3 ratios are often obtained by counting the number of carbon atoms with three bonded neighbors versus those with four bonded neighbors. (This technique requires deciding on a somewhat arbitrary metric for determining whether neighboring atoms are considered bonded or not, and is therefore merely used as an indication of the relative sp2-sp3 ratio.)

Although the characterization of amorphous carbon materials by the sp2-sp3 ratio may seem to indicate a one-dimensional range of properties between graphite and diamond, this is most definitely not the case. Research is currently ongoing into ways to characterize and expand on the range of properties offered by amorphous carbon materials.

All practical forms of hydrogenated carbon (e.g. smoke, chimney soot, mined coal such as bitumen and anthracite) contain large amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon tars, and are therefore almost certainly carcinogenic.

== Q-carbon ==
&quot;Q-carbon&quot;, short for quenched carbon, is claimed to be a type of amorphous carbon that is ferromagnetic, electrically conductive, harder than diamond, and able to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity. A research group led by Professor Jagdish Narayan and graduate student Anagh Bhaumik at North Carolina State University announced the discovery of Q-carbon in 2015. They have published numerous papers on the synthesis and characterization of Q-carbon, but years later, there is no independent experimental confirmation of this substance and its properties.

According to the researchers, Q-carbon exhibits a random amorphous structure that is a mix of 3-way (sp2) and 4-way (sp3) bonding, rather than the uniform sp3 bonding found in diamonds. Carbon is melted using nanosecond laser pulses, then quenched rapidly to form Q-carbon, or a mixture of Q-carbon and diamond. Q-carbon can be made to take multiple forms, from nanoneedles to large-area diamond films. The researchers also reported the creation of nitrogen-vacancy nanodiamonds and Q-boron nitride (Q-BN), as well as the conversion of carbon into diamond and h-BN into c-BN at ambient temperatures and air pressures. The group obtained patents on q-materials and intended to commercialize them.

In 2018, a team at University of Texas at Austin used simulations to propose theoretical explanations of the reported properties of Q-carbon, including the record high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism and hardness. However, their simulations have not been verified by other researchers.

<text>Ephraim Katzir (; – 30 May 2009) was an Israeli biophysicist and Labor Party politician. He was the fourth President of Israel from 1973 until 1978.

==Biography==
Efraim Katchalski (later Katzir) was the son of Yudel-Gersh (Yehuda) and Tzilya Katchalski, in Kiev, in the Russian Empire (today in Ukraine). In 1925 (several publications cite 1922), he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine with his family and settled in Jerusalem. In 1932, he graduated from Gymnasia Rehavia. A fellow classmate, Shulamit Laskov, remembers him as the &quot;shining star&quot; of the grade level. He was “an especially tall young man, a little pudgy, whose goodness of heart was splashed across his smiling face.” He excelled in all areas, “even in drawing and in gymnastics, where he was no slouch. He was the first in the class in arithmetic, and later on in mathematics. No one came close to him.”

Like his elder brother, Aharon, Katzir was interested in science. He studied botany, zoology, chemistry and bacteriology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1938 he received an MSc, and in 1941 he received a PhD degree. In 1939, he graduated from the first Haganah officers&#x27; course, and became commander of the student unit in the field forces (Hish).

He and his brother worked on the development of new methods of warfare. In late 1947, after the outbreak of the 1948 Palestine war, and in anticipation of the War for Israel’s Independence, Katzir met the biochemist  David Rittenberg, then working at Columbia University, stating: ‘I need germs and poisons for the [impending/ongoing Israeli] war of independence,’ Rittenberg referred the matter to Chaim Weizmann. Weizmann initially dismissed the request, branding Katzir a ‘savage’ and requested his dismissal from the Sieff Scientific Institute in Rehovot, but weeks later he relented, and his dismissal was rescinded. Shortly afterwards, in March 1948, his brother Aharon, who decades later was one of the victims of the Lod Airport Massacre, was appointed director of a research unit, HEMED, in Mandatory Palestine involving biological warfare. A decision to use such material against Palestinians was then taken in early April. In May Ben-Gurion appointed Ephraim to replace his brother as director of the HEMED research unit, given his success abroad in procuring biological warfare materials and equipment to produce them.

Katzir was married to Nina (née Gottlieb), born in Poland, who died in 1986. As an English teacher, Nina developed a unique method for teaching language. As the president&#x27;s wife, she introduced the custom of inviting the authors of children&#x27;s books and their young readers to the President&#x27;s Residence. She established the Nurit Katzir Jerusalem Theater Center in 1978 in memory of their deceased daughter, Nurit, who died from accidental carbon monoxide exposure. Another daughter, Irit, killed herself. They had a son, Meir, and three grandchildren. Katzir died on 30 May 2009 at his home in Rehovot.

==Scientific career==
After continuing his studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Columbia University and Harvard University, he returned to Israel and became head of the Department of Biophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, an institution he helped to found. In 1966–1968, Katzir was Chief Scientist of the Israel Defense Forces. His initial research centered on simple synthetic protein models, but he also developed a method for binding enzymes, which helped lay the groundwork for what is now called enzyme engineering.

== Presidency ==

In 1973, Golda Meir contacted Katzir at Harvard University, asking him to accept the presidency. He hebraicized his family name to Katzir, which means &#x27;harvest&#x27;.

On 10 March 1973, Katzir was elected by the Knesset to serve as the fourth President of Israel. He received 66 votes to 41 cast in favour of his opponent Ephraim Urbach and he assumed office on 24 May 1973. During his appointment, UN approved resolution 3379 which condemned &quot;Zionism as Racism&quot;. He was involved in the dispute between Mexico (where the resolution was initially promoted during the World Conference on Women, 1975) and the US Jewish community because of a touristic boycott directed from the latter to that country.

In November 1977, he hosted President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in the first ever official visit of an Arab head of state. In 1978, he declined to stand for a second term due to his wife&#x27;s illness, and was succeeded by Yitzhak Navon. After stepping down as President, he returned to his scientific work.

== Awards and recognition ==
* In 1959, Katzir was awarded the Israel Prize in life sciences.
* In 1966, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society
* In 1966, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences
* In 1972, he was awarded the Sir Hans Krebs Medal of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies
* In 1976, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society

* In 1985, he was awarded the Japan Prize.
* In 2000, the Rashi Foundation established the Katzir Scholarship Program in honor of Katzir, one of the first members of its board of directors.
* He is also a recipient of the Tchernichovsky Prize for exemplary translation.

He also received honorary degrees from various scientific societies and universities worldwide. The Department of Biotechnology Engineering at the ORT Braude Academic College of Engineering in Karmiel was named after him during his lifetime.

Its population is about 35,000. Ronda is known for its cliffside location and a deep canyon that carries the Guadalevín River and divides the town. It is one of the towns and villages that are included in the Sierra de las Nieves National Park.

==History==
Around the city are remains of prehistoric settlements dating to the Neolithic, including the rock art of Cueva de la Pileta.

The places of Arunda and Acinipo mentioned by Pliny have been traditionally identified with current Ronda.

In the fifth century AD, Ronda was conquered by the Suebi, led by Rechila, being reconquered in the following century by the Eastern Roman Empire, under whose rule Acinipo was abandoned. Later, the Visigothic king Liuvigild captured the city. Ronda was part of the Visigoth realm until 713, when it fell to the Umayyad troops, who named it Hisn al-Rundah (&quot;Castle of Rundah&quot;) and made it the capital of the Takurunna province.

It was the hometown of the polymath Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887), an inventor, engineer, alleged aviator, chemist, physician, Muslim poet, and Andalusian musician.

After the disintegration of the caliphate of Córdoba, Ronda became the capital of a small kingdom ruled by the Berber Banu Ifran, the taifa of Ronda. During this period, Ronda gained most of its Islamic architectural heritage. In 1065, Ronda was conquered by the taifa of Seville led by Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid. Both the poet Abu al-Baqa ar-Rundi (1204–1285) and the Sufi scholar Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (1333–1390) were born in Ronda.

Hitherto part of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, Ronda was seized by the Crown of Castile in 1485. The city was granted a &quot;fuero&quot; copying Seville&#x27;s. Upon the Christian conquest, a policy favouring the settlement of Christians in the cities while leaving Muslim majorities in the rural communities was pursued, configurating a 70%–30% balance between mudéjares and Christians settlers in the Serranía de Ronda.

In the early 16th century, a series of edicts enacted that &quot;mudéjares&quot; from the Crown of Castile must either leave or convert. The practice of Taqiyya was nonetheless common among converts from Islam (&quot;Moriscos&quot;) and cultural and religious continuity was prevalent in the area until the Alpujarras revolt. Upon the 1570 decision to resettle the so-called &quot;moriscos de paces&quot; (&quot;Moriscos&quot; uninvolved in the uprising) away from the Kingdom of Granada and the fateful actions of municipal Christian militias helmed by involving theft and enslaving, the hitherto largely peaceful &quot;morisco&quot; community in the Serranía de Ronda radicalised. &quot;Moriscos&quot; engaged in guerrilla warfare and banditry, taking advantage of their superior knowledge of the area.

In the early 19th century, the Napoleonic invasion and the subsequent Peninsular War caused much suffering in Ronda, whose inhabitants were reduced from 15,600 to 5,000 in three years. Ronda&#x27;s area became the base first of guerrilla warriors, then of numerous bandits, whose deeds inspired artists such as Washington Irving, Prosper Mérimée, and Gustave Doré. In the 19th century, the economy of Ronda was mainly based on agricultural activities. In 1918, the city was the seat of the Assembly of Ronda, in which the Andalusian flag, coat of arms, and anthem were designed.

Ronda&#x27;s Romero family—from Francisco, born in 1698, to his son Juan, to his famous grandson Pedro, who died in 1839—played a principal role in the development of modern Spanish bullfighting. In a family responsible for such innovations as the use of the cape, or &quot;muleta&quot;, and a sword especially designed for the kill, Pedro in particular transformed bullfighting into &quot;an art and a skill in its own right, and not simply ... a clownishly macho preamble to the bull&#x27;s slaughter&quot;.

Ronda was heavily affected by the Spanish Civil War, which led to emigration and depopulation. The scene in chapter 10 of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, describing the 1936 execution of Fascist sympathisers in a (fictional) village who are thrown off a cliff, is considered to be modeled on actual events of the time in Ronda.

==Geography==
Ronda is situated in a mountainous area about above mean sea level. The inner relief is gentle and includes areas of pastureland and vegetable and cereal growing areas. The Guadalevín River runs through the city, dividing it in two and carving out the steep, 100-plus-meter-deep El Tajo canyon above which the city perches. The Spanish fir is endemic to the mountains surrounding Ronda.

==Main sights==

* Three bridges span the Tajo canyon: &quot;Roman Bridge&quot; (also known as the &quot;Arabic Bridge&quot;, as the foundation is Roman and it was rebuilt above in the Arabic Period); &quot;Old Bridge&quot; (also known as the &quot;St. Michael&#x27;s Bridge&quot;); and &quot;New Bridge&quot;. The term is something of a misnomer, as the building of this bridge commenced in 1751 and took until 1793 to complete. The is the tallest of the bridges, towering above the canyon floor. The former town hall, which stands next to the , is the site of a Parador and has a view of the Tajo canyon.
* The is a bullfight that takes place once a year in Ronda in the , the oldest bullfighting ring in Spain. It was built in 1784 in the Neoclassical style by the architect José Martin de Aldehuela, who also designed the .
* The partially intact (&quot;Arabic baths&quot;) are found below the city, beside the (also known as the ) and date back to the 13th and 14th centuries. They can be visited, but are no longer in use as baths. The Arab Baths used to fulfil the function of purifying the visitors who came to the city of Ronda. They are the best preserved Arabic baths.
* The is the modern political centre of Ronda. It was here that Blas Infante showed the Andalusian flag and coat of arms for the first time in 1918. The parish church of Socorro () was only built in 1956. The building known as the Casino and (Artists&#x27; Society) is located on the north side of Ronda&#x27;s .
* The Palace () of the opens irregularly as a small museum of Renaissance art and artefacts. The palace is an 18th-century renovation of an earlier 16th century building gifted to the family of Don Vasco Martín de Salvatierra by the Catholic Monarchs when they redistributed the spoils of the Reconquest. In 1994, Madonna obtained a permit to shoot inside the palace for the music video of &quot;Take a Bow&quot;.
* Despite the name, the was never the home of a Moorish king. It was built in the 18th century, when Moorish Spain was already a distant memory. Its apparently Moorish gardens are even more recent, having been designed by the French landscape gardener Jean Claude Forestier in 1912. The house does incorporate one genuine and important relic of Ronda&#x27;s Moorish era: the so-called Water Mine, a set of steps down to the river carved into the cliff wall.
* is filled with which are approachable by car. The position of the town of Ronda provides views over the mountains of Serranía de Ronda.

==Cultural influence==

American artists Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles spent many summers in Ronda as part-time residents of Ronda&#x27;s old-town quarter called La Ciudad. Both wrote about Ronda&#x27;s beauty and famous bullfighting traditions. Their collective accounts have contributed to Ronda&#x27;s popularity over time.

In the first decades of the 20th century, the famous German poet Rainer Maria Rilke spent extended periods in Ronda, including three months at the Hotel Reina Victoria (built in 1906) between December 1912 and February 1913; his room remains to this day as he left it, a minimuseum of Rilkeana. According to the hotel&#x27;s publicity, Rilke wrote (though probably not in Spanish) &quot;He buscado por todas partes la ciudad soñada, y al fin la he encontrado en Ronda&quot; and &quot;No hay nada más inesperado en España que esta ciudad salvaje y montañera&quot; (&quot;I have sought everywhere the city of my dreams, and I have finally found it in Ronda&quot; and &quot;Nothing is more startling in Spain than this wild and mountainous city.&quot;)

Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; describes the execution of Nationalist sympathizers early in the Spanish Civil War. The Republicans murder the Nationalists by throwing them from cliffs in an Andalusian village, and Hemingway allegedly based the account on killings that took place in Ronda at the cliffs of &quot;El Tajo&quot;.

Orson Welles said he was inspired by his frequent trips to Spain and Ronda (e.g. his unfinished film about Don Quixote). After he died in 1985, his ashes were buried in a well on the rural property of his friend, retired bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.

English writer George Eliot&#x27;s book &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (&quot;Daniel of Ronda&quot;) tells the story of a Spanish Jew brought up as an Englishman. Some speculation existed that Eliot&#x27;s ancestors had lived in Ronda prior to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.

In the fashion world, Italian designer Giorgio Armani specially designed the bullfighting costume called ‘Goyesco’ for famed bullfighter Cayetano Rivera Ordóñez on the occasion of the Corrida Goyesca that took place on September 6, 2009, in Ronda. Cayetano&#x27;s suit of lights was in the Goyaesque style, comprising a jacket, trousers, and cloak in techno-satin. The three pieces were embroidered with sequins, small glitter stones, and thread, all matching the colour of the background fabric.

Ronda was used as the setting for the flower market in the 2017 animated movie &quot;Ferdinand&quot;.

==Transport==

Ronda is accessible via highways (Autovía A-374) and by rail from Algeciras and from Córdoba. A direct train from Madrid to Ronda operates twice daily.

The single-track railway between Ronda and Algeciras was built between 1890 and 1892 by the Algeciras Gibraltar Railway Company. It enabled the British military officers to escape the summer heat of Gibraltar. The railway was built by James Morrison, an engineer, in partnership with Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, a financier. The station at Ronda was opened in 1892.

<text>Kraal (also spelled &quot;craal&quot; or &quot;kraul&quot;) is an Afrikaans and Dutch word, also used in South African English, for an enclosure for cattle or other livestock, located within a Southern African settlement or village surrounded by a fence of thorn-bush branches, a palisade, mud wall, or other fencing, roughly circular in form. It is similar to a &quot;boma&quot; in eastern or central Africa.

In Curaçao, another Dutch colony, the enclosure was called &quot;koraal&quot; Which means coral and which in Papiamentu is translated &quot;kura&quot; (still in use today for any enclosed terrain, like a garden).

==Etymology==
In the Afrikaans language a &quot;kraal&quot; is a term derived from the Portuguese word , cognate with the Spanish-language , which entered into English separately. In Eastern and Central Africa, the equivalent word for a livestock enclosure is &quot;boma&quot;, but this has taken on wider meanings.

In some Southern African regions, the term Kraal is used in Scouting to refer to the team of Scout Leaders of a group.

==Homestead==
The term primarily refers to the type of dispersed homestead characteristic of the Nguni-speaking peoples of southern Africa. Although from the period of colonisation, European South Africans and historians commonly referred to the entire settlement as a &quot;kraal&quot;, ethnographers have long recognised that its proper referent is the animal pen area within a homestead. Modern ethnographers call the several human dwellings within a homestead (, , , ) houses (singular &quot;indlu&quot;; plural Xhosa and Zulu , Sotho , Swati ).

Folds for animals and enclosures made specially for defensive purposes are also called kraals.

== Zulu kraals ==
For the Zulu people, the kraal, or &quot;isibaya&quot;, in the Zulu language, acts as a homestead, a site for ritual worship, and as a defensive position. It&#x27;s laid out as a circular arrangement of beehive-shaped huts called &quot;iQukwane&quot;, which were traditionally constructed by women, surrounding a cattle enclosure. They are always built on one of Zululand&#x27;s many hills, orientated downwards. The term &quot;kraal&quot; refers both to the village itself and the central cattle enclosure.

=== Layout ===
Kraals are built on a hill sloping downwards, with the entrance facing the bottom of the hill for sanitary, defensive, and ritual purposes. There is an outside wooden fence that encompasses the entire kraal, and then an interior one for the cattle enclosure. The hut opposite of the entrance was the home of either the chief&#x27;s mother or the chief himself. The huts closest to the chief&#x27;s were those of his wives, with the great wife closest to his own. Closer to the entrance, the huts of the sons of the village were placed on the left side and the huts of the daughters of the village on the right. In each hut would be an &quot;umsamo&quot;, a special ritual area, with the most important &quot;umsamo&quot; located in the chief&#x27;s hut. The huts nearest the entrance were used for guests and visitors. Additionally, there would be multiple watchtowers in the kraal.

=== Ritual uses ===
The &quot;umsamo&quot; within the chief&#x27;s hut was an important site for communicating with ancestor spirits. Similarly, there would be a site on the cattle enclosure&#x27;s west side for performance of rituals directed at ancestors. These rituals were usually carried out by the headman, an important ceremonial position in traditional Zulu society.

<text>The VIA C7 is an x86 central processing unit designed by Centaur Technology and sold by VIA Technologies.

== Product history ==
The C7 delivers a number of improvements to the older VIA C3 cores but is nearly identical to the latest VIA C3 Nehemiah core. The C7 was officially launched in May 2005, although according to market reports, full volume production was not in place at that date. In May 2006 Intel&#x27;s cross-licensing agreement with VIA expired and was not renewed, which was the reason for the forced termination of C3 shipments on March 31, 2006, as VIA lost rights to the Socket 370.
A 1 GHz C7 processor with 128kB of cache memory is used in VIA&#x27;s own PX10000G motherboard which is based on the proprietary Pico-ITX form factor. The chip is cooled by a large heatsink that covers most of the board and a small 40mm fan.

In early April 2008 the schoolroom-use oriented, ultra-portable HP 2133 Mini-Note PC family debuted with an entirely VIA-based, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.6 GHz C7-M processor portfolio, where the lowest speed model is optimized for running an SSD-based 4GB Linux distribution with a sub $500 price tag, while the middle tier carries Windows XP and the top model comes with Windows Vista Business, factory default. HP chose the single-core VIA C7-M CPU in order to meet the already fixed $499 starting price, even though Intel&#x27;s competing Atom processor line debuted on 2 April 2008.
The C7 is sold in five main versions:
* C7: for desktops / laptops (1.5-2.0 GHz) - FCPGA Pentium-M package, 400, 533, 800 MHz FSB
* C7-M: for mobiles / embedded (1.5-2.0 GHz) - NanoBGA2, 21mm × 21mm, 400, 800 MHz FSB
* C7-M Ultra Low Voltage: for mobiles / embedded (1.0-1.6 GHz) - NanoBGA2, 21mm × 21mm, 400, 800 MHz FSB
* C7-D: similar to original C7, but RoHS-compliant and marketed as &quot;carbon-free processor&quot;. Some variants do not support PowerSaver
* Eden: Some VIA Eden CPUs are based on a C7 core with low power consumption, package size, and clock rates as low as 400 MHz.

== CPU cores ==

=== Esther ===
The Esther (C5J) is the next evolution step of the Nehemiah+ (C5P) core of the VIA C3 line-up.

New Features of this core include:
* Average power consumption of less than 1 watt.
* 2 GHz operation and a TDP of 20 watts.
* L2 cache increased from 64k to 128k, with associativity increased from 16-way set associative in C3 to 32-way set associative in C7.
* VIA has stated the C7 bus is physically based upon the Pentium-M 479-pin packaging, but uses the proprietary VIA V4 bus for electrical signalling, instead of Intel’s AGTL+ Quad Pumped Bus, avoiding legal infringement.
* &quot;Twin Turbo&quot; technology, which consists of dual PLLs, one set at a high clock speed, and the other set at a lower speed. This allows the processor&#x27;s clock frequency to be adjusted in a single processor cycle. Lower switching latency means that more aggressive regulation can be employed.
* Support for SSE2 and SSE3 extended instructions.
* NX bit in PAE mode that prevents buffer overflow software bugs from being exploitable by viruses or attackers.
* Hardware support for SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashing.
* Hardware based &quot;Montgomery multiplier&quot; supporting key sizes up to 32K for public-key cryptography.

==Design choices==
* C7 Esther as an evolutionary step after C3 Nehemiah, in which VIA / Centaur followed their traditional approach of balancing performance against a constrained transistor / power budget.
* The cornerstone of the C3 series chips&#x27; design philosophy has been that even a relatively simple in-order scalar core can offer reasonable performance against a complex superscalar out-of-order core if supported by an efficient &quot;front-end&quot;, i.e. prefetch, cache and branch prediction mechanisms.
* In the case of C7, the design team have focused on further streamlining the (front-end) of the chip, i.e. cache size, associativity and throughput as well as the prefetch system. At the same time no significant changes to the execution core (back-end) of the chip.
* The C7 successfully further closes the gap in performance with AMD / Intel chips, since clock speed is not thermally constrained.

<text>Oton Gliha (Črnomelj, 21 May 1914 - Zagreb, 19 July 1999) was a Croatian artist, born in Slovenia. A graduate of the Academy of fine Arts in Zagreb, Gliha continued his studies in Paris, Vienna and Munich. He is best known for his series of abstract paintings based on the patterns of the drystone walls of coastal Croatia. The first in the series appeared in 1954, and it was a theme he developed for the rest of his life.

Gliha held solo exhibitions of his work in Croatia, and abroad. He participated in the Venice Bienniales of 1962 and 1964. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb.

Oton Gliha received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement in 1977. He was elected to the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1998. Oton Gliha&#x27;s paintings are held in public collections around the world, for example New York, São Paulo, Paris and Turin.

==Biography==

Oton Gliha was born 21 May 1914 in Črnomelj, then in Austria-Hungary, today in Slovenia. His parents were originally from Istria, on the northern part of the Croatian coast. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Osijek, where young Oton attended primary school. In 1924, the family moved again, this time to Zagreb. Completing high school in 1933, Gliha enrolled in the Academy of fine Arts, where he studied under prominent Croatian artists such as Maksimilijan Vanka, Tomislav Krizman, Ljubo Babić. He graduated in 1937, in the class of Marino Tartaglia.

While at the academy, Gliha met and married fellow art student Mila Kumbatović. Her family came from the island of Krk, where the couple would spend much of their time when not in Zagreb. The images of the island would make a strong impression on Gliha&#x27;s art.

In 1938, Gliha participated in his first exhibition in Zagreb, and in 1954 held his first solo exhibition. That year, the painting Primorje (Coast) introduced the Drystone Walls cycle that would become Gliha&#x27;s life work. In 1957, a second solo exhibition focused completely on his paintings of the Drystone Walls of Krk.

Gliha travelled and exhibited his work abroad, including several visits to Paris, Italy (in 1952 and 1961), USA (in 1958 and 1979).

In 1977, Gliha received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement in the visual arts.

In 1998, he was elected a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Oton Gliha died 19 June 1999 in Zagreb.

==Legacy==

Gliha&#x27;s early work during the 1930s and 40s were landscapes, portraits and still lifes, painted with in conventional, rather neutral colours. His landscapes showed the influence of Paul Cézanne, and he tended to use thick paint in an impasto style to describe the form in his still life subjects.

In the 1950s, lyrical abstraction was taking hold across Europe, with a new abstraction based on natural subjects. In 1954, Oton Gliha painted &quot;Primorje&quot;, a coastal landscape that marked the beginning of one of the major series in Croatian art. His subject was the lattice of drystone walls (&quot;gromače&quot;), so common on the island of Krk, and along the Croatian coast. In Gliha&#x27;s mind, he connected the patterns of the walls on the landscape with the ancient Croatian glagolitic script from early religious texts and stone inscriptions.

Gliha himself described the connection: &quot;All at once, I saw the image of that landscape from Krk, criss-crossed by drystone walls as an old tablet with Glagolitic script carved upon it. This association may seem strange, funny even, but for me at that moment it was fate. It helped me unravel all the excitement that I used to carry within myself, observing that strange geometry, architecture and sculpture that man had unconsciously created in his struggle with stone. By making most of the earth free of stone, man used the same stone to put it back into captivity, by fencing it off by drystone walls. When I stand within them I feel, I don&#x27;t know why, very happy and filled by some silent festive joy. I feel the presence of a multitude of people and can hear their voices. Time seems to come to a standstill, reality becomes unreal. The faraway past seems to be the present; the present and future seem like the past: I experience an intense feeling of the presence of eternity. This spiritual state gives me power and stamina.&quot;

Gliha&#x27;s excitement about his subject led him to interpret the motif in endlessly creative ways for the rest of his life. The shapes, rhythms and textures are caught in a variety of artistic styles and techniques, each one creating an individual mood from joyous to sad and reflective. By the 1960s and 70s, Gliha was using the motif to investigate the depth of the picture&#x27;s space, the effect of light on the ethereal quality of the atmosphere and colour accents upon the plasticity of the form. His style by then had reached its full maturity. Gliha&#x27;s motif became a constant in his art, and is immediately identifiable in all its variations. That is the indicator of all great painters when they have reached the peak of their life&#x27;s work.

Oton Gliha&#x27;s art can be seen in public collections around the world. The Guggenheim Museum in New York bought one of his paintings as early as 1958. Gliha held solo exhibitions in leading modern art galleries in Turin, 1960; São Paulo, 1961 and Milan in 1964. He participated at the 31st and 32nd Biennale in Venice and he also painted his dry stone walls as large compositions for public venues. For example, the frescos in the Federal Executive Council in Belgrade, 1962, the mosaic in the lounge of Krk airport, 1970, and the festive curtain of the National Theatre in Rijeka, 1981.

Since Gliha&#x27;s death in 1999, two books have been published about his work. In 2002, a comprehensive monograph was released by Masmedia in Zagreb, containing an almost complete photographic record of his work. A second publication in 2011 by the Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb assesses the importance of Gliha&#x27;s work within Croatian Contemporary art.

In 2003, Croatian Post, Inc issued a stamp with Gliha&#x27;s &quot;Gromače 5-71&quot; (&quot;Drystone Wall 5-71&quot;), 1971, as part of their Croatian Modern Art series.

Oton&#x27;s relatives, Vilko Gliha Selan (1912-1979) was also a well known Croatian painter and illustrator, and Christina Gliha is following in the family footsteps as a commercial illustrator.

<text>A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water that do not intermix. In ordinary, holomictic lakes, at least once each year, there is a physical mixing of the surface and the deep waters.

The term &quot;meromictic&quot; was coined by the Austrian Ingo Findenegg in 1935, apparently based on the older word &quot;holomictic&quot;. The concepts and terminology used in describing meromictic lakes were essentially complete following some additions by G. Evelyn Hutchinson in 1937.

== Characteristics ==

Most lakes are &quot;holomictic&quot;: at least once per year, the surface and the deep waters mix. In monomictic lakes, the mixing occurs once per year; in dimictic lakes, it occurs twice a year (typically spring and autumn), and in polymictic lakes, the mixing occurs several times a year. In meromictic lakes, the layers of water can remain unmixed for years, decades, or centuries.

Meromictic lakes can usually be divided into three sections or layers. The bottom layer is the &quot;monimolimnion&quot;; the waters in this portion of the lake circulate little, and are generally hypoxic and more saline than the rest of the lake. The top layer is the &quot;mixolimnion&quot;, and essentially behaves like a holomictic lake. The area in between is the chemocline, or chemolimnion.

The lack of mixing between layers creates radically different environments for life: the stratification, or stable layering, of lake waters means that the bottom layer receives little oxygen from the atmosphere, hence becomes depleted of oxygen. While the surface layer may have 10 mg/L or more dissolved oxygen in summer, the depths of a meromictic lake can have less than 1 mg/L. Very few organisms can live in such an oxygen-poor environment. One exception is purple sulfur bacteria. These bacteria, commonly found at the top of the monimolimnion in such lakes, use sulfur compounds such as sulfides in photosynthesis. These compounds are produced by decomposition of organic sediments in oxygen-poor environments. The monimolimnion is often rich in phosphorus and nitrogen. These factors combine to create an ideal environment for bacterial growth. The mixolimnion can have similar qualities. However, the types of bacteria that can grow at the surface are determined by the amount of light received at the surface.

A meromictic lake may form because the basin is unusually deep and steep-sided compared to the lake&#x27;s surface area, or because the lower layer of the lake is highly saline and denser than the upper layers of water. However, human influence can lead to cultural meromixis occurring. The increased use of road salt as a deicing strategy, particularly in northern latitude regions, can disturb the natural mixing cycles in lakes by inhibiting mixing. As salt is flushed into aquatic systems at high concentrations in late winter/early spring, it accumulates in the deepest layer of lakes leading to incomplete mixing.

Stratification in meromictic lakes can be either endogenic or ectogenic. Endogenic means the patterns seen in the lake are caused by internal events, such as organic matter accumulating in the sediments and decaying, whereas ectogenic means the patterns seen are caused by external causes, like an intrusion of saltwater settling in the hypolimnion, preventing it from mixing.

The layers of sediment at the bottom of a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there is little physical mixing and few living organisms to agitate them. There is also little chemical decomposition. For this reason, cores of the sediment at the bottom of meromictic lakes are important in tracing past changes in climate at the lake, by examining trapped pollen grains and the types of sediments [see Proxy (climate)].

When the layers do mix for whatever reason, the consequences can be devastating for organisms that normally live in the mixolimnion. This layer is usually much smaller in volume than the monimolimnion. When the layers mix, the oxygen concentration at the surface will decrease dramatically. This can result in the death of many organisms, such as fish, that require oxygen.

Occasionally, carbon dioxide, methane, or other dissolved gases can build up relatively undisturbed in the lower layers of a meromictic lake. When the stratification is disturbed, as could happen from an earthquake, a limnic eruption may result. In 1986, a notable event of this type took place at Lake Nyos in Cameroon, causing nearly 1,800 deaths. In the following decades after this disaster, active research and management has been done to mitigate gas buildup in the future through the Nyos Organ Pipes Program (NOPP). The NOPP program placed large organ pipes into Lake Nyos, to reach the monimolimnion where harmful dissolved gases built up, that allow for gas release to the atmosphere, effectively degassing the monimolimnion. Since 2019, Lake Nyos has successfully been degassed to a nonhazardous concentration of dissolved gas. Paralleling Lake Nyos, Lake Kivu is another lake that poses a potentially fatal threat to the community. Some management strategies have suggested taking a different approach, moving gases from the monimolimnion to the mixolimnion, rather than degassing to the atmosphere through organ pipes.

While it is mainly lakes that are meromictic, the world&#x27;s largest meromictic basin is the Black Sea. The deep waters below do not mix with the upper layers that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water. The Caspian Sea is anoxic below . The Baltic Sea is persistently stratified, with dense, highly saline water comprising the bottom layer, and large areas of hypoxic sediments (see Baltic Sea hypoxia).


== List of meromictic lakes ==

There are meromictic lakes all over the world. The distribution appears to be clustered, but this may be due to incomplete investigations. Depending on the exact definition of &quot;meromictic&quot;, the ratio between meromictic and holomictic lakes worldwide is around 1:1000.

<text>Electrical Audio is a recording facility founded in Chicago, Illinois by musician and recording engineer Steve Albini in 1997. Hundreds of independent music projects have been recorded there. Unlike most producers, Albini refused to take any royalties from musicians who record at the studio.

Founded during an era of increasing popularity for digital recording, Electrical Audio was unusual for using only analog recording technology, including mixing consoles, tape recorders and many outboard sound effects. The rooms are also designed to offer natural reverberation rather than adding the quality in post-production.

In a 2007 post on the studio&#x27;s message board, the studio&#x27;s technician Greg Norman revealed that the studio had acquired a Pro Tools rig for computer-aided recording and editing, saying it had become &quot;as important to have as a piano&quot;. Norman also went on to write that Albini, who disliked digital recording, &quot;won&#x27;t be recording with [Pro Tools]. So don&#x27;t ask him about it.&quot;

==Studio layout==
The facility was built by gutting an existing building and customizing the space to Albini&#x27;s specifications, including walls made of adobe bricks shipped from New Mexico. Electrical Audio comprises two separate studios, A and B.

===Studio A===
Studio A is the larger of the two studios and has three separate performance rooms. Center Field is the largest at , Alcatraz is a &#x27;dry environment&#x27; room and Kentucky is a brighter live room with improved low frequency linearity. The control room runs a 48 channel Neotek Elite console and can accommodate up to 132 inputs.

===Studio B===
Studio B is the smaller of the two studios with an live room and a isolation room. The control room runs a 36 input Neotek Series II console.

<doc id="1006719" wikidata="Q726148" url="?curid=1006719" title="Richie McCaw">
<text>Richard Hugh McCaw (born 31 December 1980) is a retired New Zealand professional rugby union player. He captained the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, in 110 out of his 148 test matches, and won two Rugby World Cups. He has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award a joint record three times and was the most capped test rugby player of all time from August 2015 to October 2020. McCaw was awarded World Rugby player of the decade (2011–2020) in 2021. McCaw is also a winner of the New Zealand sportsman of the decade award.

McCaw was the first All Black to reach 100 caps, and the first rugby union player to win 100 tests. He was the most-capped player in rugby union history with 148 caps, having overtaken Brian O&#x27;Driscoll&#x27;s record in 2015 and losing the record to Alun Wyn Jones in 2020. McCaw has also equaled the record for most appearances at the Rugby World Cup, with Jason Leonard.

McCaw predominantly played in the openside flanker position for the New Zealand, Crusaders and Canterbury teams, but also played as a blindside flanker and no. 8. During McCaw&#x27;s career, Canterbury won the NPC (later Mitre10 Cup) five times, and the Crusaders won four Super Rugby titles. In addition to winning two world cups, the All Blacks won seven Tri-Nations titles, completed three successful Grand Slam tours and won the Bledisloe Cup eight times.

He made his debut in 2001 for the Crusaders, and was selected for the All Blacks&#x27; 2001 end-of-year tour, despite having played only eight minutes of Super 12 rugby. His debut for New Zealand was against Ireland, where he was awarded man-of-the-match. McCaw became a regular selection for New Zealand, only missing a few games due to recurring concussions. In 2004 he was appointed captain of the All Blacks, whom he led at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. After their elimination in the quarter-finals, his captaincy came under criticism, but he was retained and eventually led the team to consecutive Rugby World Cup titles in 2011 and 2015, becoming one of only 43 players who have won the Rugby World Cup on multiple occasions. McCaw is however the only captain to have won two Rugby World Cups.

McCaw holds the international record for most game wins as a player at 131. He also holds the international record for most games as a captain at 110.

==Family and early years==

His paternal fourth great-grandfather was Seth Smith, who built large proportions of Belgravia &amp; Mayfair in London in the 1830s, related through his great, great-grandmother Sarah Annette Seth-Smith McCaw. McCaw&#x27;s great-great-grandfather immigrated to New Zealand from the Scottish Borders in 1893, and settled in the Hakataramea Valley, Waimate District, South Canterbury. McCaw&#x27;s father took over the family farm and his mother was a teacher at Kurow.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1980, Richard Hugh McCaw was born in the nearby town of Oamaru. He grew up on his parents&#x27; farm along with his sister Joanna. McCaw started flying gliders with his grandfather J H &#x27;Jim&#x27; McCaw, a Tempest pilot during World War II credited with shooting down 20 V1 missiles, when he was nine years old. He played rugby for the local Kurow rugby club as a youngster, but it was not until 1994, when he boarded at Otago Boys&#x27; High School in Dunedin, that he started to take the game seriously.

In his last year at Otago Boys&#x27; High, McCaw was head boy, &quot;proxime accessit&quot; (runner up) to the dux and played in the school&#x27;s 1st XV. McCaw came to the attention of national selectors during a 5-all draw with Rotorua Boys&#x27; High School in the 1998 New Zealand secondary schools rugby final in Christchurch. However, he failed to make the New Zealand Secondary Schools Team, losing out to Sam Harding, Angus McDonald and Hale T-Pole. With Sam Harding moving south to study at the University of Otago, McCaw headed to Christchurch&#x27;s Lincoln University to study agricultural science and pursue his rugby interests. He achieved all but two papers for his Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree before deciding to pursue his rugby career instead. He received an honorary doctorate in recognition of his sporting achievements in April 2012.

In 1999, McCaw was selected in the New Zealand under-19 squad (coached by Mark Shaw), which won the world championship in Wales. During that series, McCaw realised his All Blacks dream could be attainable. The following year he was selected in the New Zealand under-21 squad and debuted for Canterbury in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) against North Harbour. On 31 March 2001, he made his Super Rugby debut with the Crusaders, playing a few minutes in a losing effort against the Hurricanes. That year he only played twice for the Crusaders, both times as a substitute, for a total of just eight minutes playing time. He did however play a full season with NPC champions Canterbury and captained the New Zealand Under 21s.

==Playing career==

===International debut===
Although the then 20-year-old McCaw had only played seventeen matches for Canterbury, John Mitchell, the new All Black coach, selected him for the 2001 end of year tour to Ireland, Scotland and Argentina. This led Josh Kronfeld, a former All Black openside flanker, to criticise the selection: &quot;You might as well just give All Black jerseys to everybody. The fact they picked guys off one NPC season is bloody incredible&quot;.

McCaw&#x27;s debut international test was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 17 November 2001. His first touch of the game resulted in a knock-on when he was hit in a tackle and New Zealand were trailing the Irish 16–7 at half-time. In the second half the All Blacks recovered to win 40–29 and McCaw was named man of the match, receiving a standing ovation at the post-match function. A turning point came in the second half when McCaw was able to steal the ball from Ireland, which led to a try to left wing Jonah Lomu. After the match McCaw recalled the experience: &quot;it was a hell of a stadium to play at, a real rugby stadium, a big crowd – something I&#x27;ll always remember, very special.&quot;

McCaw played all three tests on the tour, with the All Blacks beating Scotland 37–6 and winning 24–20 against Argentina. At the end of season rugby awards, McCaw was selected as both the New Zealand Rugby Football Union Under-21 and Air New Zealand NPC Division One Player of the Year.

===2002–2003===
In the lead-up to the 2003 World Cup McCaw was a regular player for Canterbury, the Crusaders and the All Blacks. In 2002 and 2003 the Crusaders competed in the Super Rugby final, beating the Brumbies in 2002 and losing to the Blues in 2003. The Canterbury provincial rugby team lost the semi-final to the eventual winners Auckland in 2002. McCaw and the other All Blacks were &quot;rested&quot; during the 2003 national provincial championship.

In 2002 McCaw played for the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the Tri Nations against Australia and South Africa. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia. The 14–16 loss occurred in New Zealand&#x27;s third Tri Nations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia. During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process. McCaw and A.J. Venter wrestled the assailant off the referee and, according to McHugh, if they had not got involved his shoulder would have been broken. McCaw was rested, along with 20 other members of the Tri Nations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.

In 2002 McCaw was voted as Newcomer of the Year by the International Rugby Players Association. This award is voted on by all international players, with players not allowed to vote for members of their own team.

After another successful campaign with the Crusaders in 2003 (reaching the Super 12 finals), McCaw was again selected as first choice openside flanker for the All Blacks. In June he was involved in a narrow 13–15 defeat at home to England, was a non-playing reserve in a 55–3 victory against Wales and played in a 31–23 win over France.
The 2003 All Blacks retained the Tri Nations title, regained the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 1997 and were ranked second behind England leading into the World Cup.

McCaw was selected as openside flanker for the 2003 All Blacks World Cup squad and played in every game at the tournament. New Zealand won all their pool games and beat South Africa in the quarter-finals to qualify for a semi-final match-up against Australia. In an upset, the Australians defeated the All Blacks, knocking them out of the tournament. At the end of the season awards McCaw received the Kel Tremain Trophy for the New Zealand Rugby Union player of the year.

===2004–2005===
The Crusaders finished as runner-ups in the 2004 Super 12 season, losing the final to the Brumbies. Following the World Cup, John Mitchell was dropped as All Black coach and replaced by Graham Henry. McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker and made vice captain. In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering concussion following a clash of heads with fellow All Black Xavier Rush. He was a late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina before again leaving the field due to dizziness.
Still suffering headaches a month later, he withdrew from the rest of the home campaign and the 2004 Tri Nations to focus on recovery. McCaw returned to captain Canterbury to the finals at the tail end of the NPC season. In November 2004 he returned for the All Blacks&#x27; end-of-season tour to Italy, Wales and France. He was made captain at the age of 23 for the first time against Wales as regular captain Tana Umaga was rested.

In April 2005, while captaining the Crusaders, McCaw again suffered a concussion. He was stretchered off the field two minutes into the game after attempting a tackle on Bulls prop Richard Bands. After the incident, McCaw visited a young boy in hospital who had broken his neck playing rugby and started to question whether he should be playing the game. Another paraplegic in the ward told him he had broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji, convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere, and you may as well &quot;do what you enjoy&quot;. A month later, in May 2005, McCaw returned to training with the Crusaders and led them in their semi-final and final victories.

McCaw returned to international rugby in 2005, playing in the 91–0 victory over Fiji before the British and Irish Lions arrived. He then played the first two test against the Lions, including a record 48–18 victory in Wellington. The All Blacks defeated the touring Lions 3–0 in the series. McCaw was part of the successful Tri Nations campaign (losing just one game) and Grand Slam (when victory is achieved against the four home nations) end of year tour. He missed the game against England after suffering his third serious head knock against Ireland. Despite his injury concerns, McCaw was shortlisted for the 2005 IRB International Player of the Year, which was won by All Black teammate Dan Carter.

===2006–2007===

McCaw led the Crusaders to the Super Rugby title again in 2006. In May 2006, at the age of 25 and after 36 test matches, McCaw was named captain of the All Blacks. His first two games as regular captain were against Ireland in New Zealand, while a separate squad led by Jerry Collins was named to travel to Argentina for a one-off game. McCaw started his captaincy with victory over Ireland and then mentored stand-in captain Jerry Collins in Argentina. New Zealand emerged as 2006 Tri Nations champions (the only loss away to South Africa by one point) and retained the Bledisloe Cup. A successful European tour saw comfortable victories against England, France twice and Wales. McCaw was captain in every match and after being short listed in 2002, 2003 and 2005 was named the 2006 IRB International Player of the Year.

Because 2007 was a World Cup year, All Black management decided that a select group of 22 players, including McCaw, would undergo &quot;reconditioning&quot; by not playing in the first seven rounds of the Super 14. McCaw returned to the Crusaders in the eighth round and helped them reach the semi-finals. New Zealand then beat a below-strength France team in two tests and won a one-off test against Canada. McCaw started on the bench for the Canadian match, with Reuben Thorne returning as captain. The Tri Nations was shortened because of the World Cup, with each team playing the other two teams twice (one home and one away game). Led by McCaw, New Zealand again dropped just one game (this time a five-point loss against Australia in Melbourne) retaining the Tri Nations crown and the Bledisloe cup.

====2007 World Cup====
The 2007 World Cup was held in France, Scotland and Wales. The All Blacks were in a pool that included Italy, Portugal, Scotland and Romania. The All Blacks comfortably made it through the pool play with scores of 76–14, 108–13, 40–0 and 85–8 respectively. McCaw made just three appearances (two starts and one as a reserve) due to Henry&#x27;s rotation policy. In the quarter-finals the All Blacks lost to France 18–20, resulting in New Zealand&#x27;s earliest exit from a World Cup. With semi-final exits after being among the favourites at the 1991, 1999 and 2003 World Cups, they were once again accused of &quot;choking on the world&#x27;s biggest stage&quot;.

An emotional McCaw could not hide his disappointment at the after-match press conference: &quot;If I knew the answers we would have sorted it out. We will be thinking about it for a long time&quot;. McCaw denied New Zealand&#x27;s easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss &quot;A lot of the guys have been through this before, they&#x27;ve played big test matches.&quot; Graham Henry&#x27;s policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.

===2008===
Despite much speculation that Henry would lose the All Black coaching job to coach Robbie Deans, he was retained on a contract for the next two years, later extended to include the 2011 World Cup. He immediately stated that he would retain McCaw as his captain. Robbie Deans instead signed with the Australian Rugby Union, becoming head coach of Australia. In Deans&#x27; last season (2008) as Crusaders coach they won the Super Rugby title for the seventh time. Ireland and England toured to New Zealand in June 2008 and the All Blacks came away with a hard-fought win against Ireland, and two comfortable victories against England. McCaw tore a ligament in his ankle against England and missed the start of the Tri Nations.

Rodney So&#x27;oialo was made stand-in captain and started the Tri Nations with a win and two losses. McCaw returned for the fourth game and the All Blacks won the remaining three matches to retain the Tri Nations title and Bledisloe Cup. McCaw was seen as an inspiration after his return from injury, with Henry rating his performance in the 19–0 win in South Africa (the first time the South Africans had been kept scoreless on home soil in 105 years) as his best so far for the All Blacks.

In 2008 a fourth Bledisloe match was played in Hong Kong with the intention of expanding the game of rugby and in a close 19–14 game McCaw scored the match winning try. The Grand Slam tour to the United Kingdom and Ireland resulted in victories over Scotland (32–6), Ireland (22–3), Wales (29–9) and England (32–6). During 2008 McCaw won every test he captained and a total of 26 out of 28 games he played in at all levels. The All Blacks won 13 of a record 15 tests, retained the Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations Trophy, completed the Grand Slam and reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking from South Africa.

McCaw finished 2008 by making his debut for the Barbarians against Australia at Twickenham in an 11–18 loss.

===2009–2010===
The Crusaders, under new coach Todd Blackadder, had a slow start to the 2009 season, losing four of their first five games. They recovered to finish fourth on the table, losing the semi-final at Loftus Versfeld to the Bulls. McCaw injured his knee and missed the start of the international season, returning for the Tri Nations tournament. South Africa beat the All Blacks in every match to win the title and regain the number 1 ranking, with New Zealand beating Australia three times to finish second. It was the first time New Zealand had not won the competition in five years and the fifth time since the Tri Nations started in 1996. A fourth Bledisloe Test against Australia was played in Japan before New Zealand toured Europe. Although New Zealand won every match on tour, an earlier loss to France and three defeats by the South Africans were the most suffered by the All Blacks in a season since McCaw joined the team in 2001. Despite the team&#x27;s relatively poor season, McCaw was named the IRB International Player of the Year for a second time.

The 2010 season started in much the same way with the Crusaders finishing fourth during the round robin stage and losing to the Bulls in the semi-final. During the season McCaw played his 100th Super Rugby game in a losing effort against the Cape Town-based Stormers. New Zealand recorded victories over the touring Ireland and Wales teams, Ireland losing their match by a record 66–28 after number eight Jamie Heaslip received a red card for kneeing McCaw in the head. The All Blacks went through the Tri Nations undefeated with the final game of the tournament against Australia marking McCaw&#x27;s 52nd time captaining the All Blacks, surpassing Sean Fitzpatrick as New Zealand&#x27;s most-capped test captain.

The fourth Bledisloe Cup match was again scheduled for Hong Kong and Australia ended a ten match losing streak to the All Blacks. It was to be the only loss the All Blacks would suffer that season as they went on to win another Grand Slam tour, defeating England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. In the match against Ireland McCaw, along with teammate Mils Muliaina played in their 93rd test match passing Sean Fitzpatrick to become the most capped All Blacks. At the end of the year McCaw was named the IRB International Player of the Year for the second successive season and the New Zealand sportsperson of the year at the Halberg Awards.

===2011 Rugby World Cup===

During preseason training in January 2011 McCaw injured his foot, subsequent x-rays revealed that he had received a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal of his right foot. It was determined his best chance of recovery was to undergo an operation where a pin was inserted. As a result, McCaw missed the opening two months of the Super Rugby season. During the All Black&#x27;s third Rugby World Cup pool match against France, McCaw became the first All Black to reach 100 test caps. However, it was also during this match McCaw re-aggravated his foot injury. In order to rest his injury, he was forced to skip the more physical aspects of training and miss the All Blacks&#x27; final pool match against Canada. Prior to the quarter-final against Argentina McCaw decided against having another x-ray. Following the re-occurrence of his injury it was uncertain whether McCaw could continue to play for the All Blacks, this forced the coaching staff to develop contingency plans and Matt Todd was called into the All Black training squad. McCaw was able to continue to play throughout the World Cup tournament and lifted the Webb Ellis trophy after a tense 8–7 victory over France. This was the lowest score in a final in World Cup history. After the final, the All Black coach Graham Henry stated &quot;He can hardly walk and how he played today I just don&#x27;t know,&quot; and he acknowledged the All Blacks probably would not have won without him. Following the World Cup x-rays showed that the screw in his foot, necessary to stop the deterioration of the original injury had caused a second fracture. The fracture again, required a further operation.

After the Rugby World Cup McCaw was selected in the RWC Dream Team. This team was determined by public vote, with over 160,000 votes cast. In addition, for the second successive year McCaw was named the New Zealand sportsperson of the year at the Halberg Awards.

===2012–2015===
Under new coach Steve Hansen, the All Blacks won 12 tests, drew one and only lost one test in 2012, as well as winning the new Rugby Championship with a 100% winning record. During this time McCaw overtook George Gregan for most times on the winning side with 94. He also recorded his 100th win against South Africa in Dunedin. McCaw was a nominee for the IRB Player of the Year award but lost out to teammate Dan Carter.

In the first half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw enforced the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract. As a result, he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby, and missed the 2013 French Test Series. He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship. During this campaign, McCaw equalled (with Brian O&#x27;Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013. Following the All Blacks victory over the Springboks in Ellis Park, McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium.
Along with Kieran Read, McCaw led the All Blacks to a perfect season in 2013, winning 14 out of 14.

McCaw captained New Zealand for the 100th time on 22 November 2014 in the end of year international against Wales. He is the first rugby union player to achieve 100 caps as captain. On 15 August 2015, McCaw surpassed Ireland&#x27;s Brian O&#x27;Driscoll world record, as the most capped rugby player when he won his 142nd cap against Australia in the Bledisloe Cup. He would go on to hold this title for five years until 31 October 2020 when Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones got his 149th cap.

On 31 October 2015, McCaw captained New Zealand to retain the Rugby World Cup after a 34–17 win against Australia in the final at Twickenham. This match was the thirteenth Rugby World Game as captain and is the current world record for this statistic. During the tournament he received a yellow card for foottripping in the opening game against Argentina. On 19 November 2015, McCaw announced his retirement from rugby.

===Leading of haka===

Despite McCaw often being captain in tests, he generally turned down the role of haka leader (&quot;kaea&quot;). He only served as the kaea in 11 tests, only when the All Blacks performed &#x27;Ka Mate&#x27;.

==Playing style==
McCaw predominately played at openside flanker, although he has played in the other &quot;loose forward&quot; positions of blindside flanker and number eight for the Crusaders. The openside flanker binds to the side of the scrum farthest from the touch-line and is usually one of the first players to reach a breakdown. In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:&quot;My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I&#x27;m usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. Thirdly I put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to turn their ball over.&quot;

McCaw has been described as the best openside flanker of all time. He has been awarded the IRB Player of the Year a record three times and has been nominated on eight occasions. When he received the IRB Player of The Year award for the third time former Australian lock and award chairperson John Eales described him as &quot;an outstanding captain, a world class player and a role model for our sport&quot;. Along with Dan Carter, he is seen as one of the most influential members of the All Blacks. McCaw considers his ability to anticipate play as one of his most important skills.

Australian openside David Pocock, who was also shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game as well as his ability to read the referee. One of McCaw&#x27;s strengths is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of his game.

Not all agree with McCaw&#x27;s playing style and many believe that he pushes the boundaries of legality. He has been labelled a &quot;cheat&quot; by both former South Africa coach Peter de Villiers and former Australian coach Bob Dwyer. Longtime Springboks lock Victor Matfield said in 2010 that the referees let &quot;him get away with murder&quot; at the breakdown. Shortly after the 2011 Rugby World Cup final, veteran France back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy criticised McCaw saying that &quot;he played the whole match in our [Frances] camp.&quot; Former Australian coach Eddie Jones and flanker Phil Waugh say he does no more than any other good openside, but his skill at judging how the referee will interpret the breakdown is the main reason for his success. McCaw admits that he tests the referee early &quot;to know what you can get away with&quot; and that only an &quot;idiot&quot; would not adapt to their rulings.

Teammate Aaron Mauger, along with many New Zealand fans, have suggested that McCaw&#x27;s influence and playing style has made him a target for illegitimate play. International players Phil Waugh, Jamie Heaslip, Marcus Horan, Lote Tuqiri, Andy Powell, Dylan Hartley, Quade Cooper, Dean Greyling, Kevin McLaughlin and Scott Higginbotham have been accused of making &quot;cheap shots&quot; on McCaw. He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders, with Neemia Tialata, Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play. According to McCaw &quot;what happens on the field stays on the field&quot; and if he gets extra attention it is because he &quot;must be doing something right&quot;.

In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and selectors wagered the potential returns in finishing games with two openside flankers on the field as a way to counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw&#x27;s and Dan Carter&#x27;s career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there. The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.”

==International record by opposition==
==Playing achievements==
==Personal life==
In January 2013 it was reported that he had been seeing hockey player Gemma Flynn for the past six months. McCaw announced his engagement to Flynn in January 2016. They married on 14 January 2017. Their daughter was born in December 2018 and a second daughter in May 2021. Their third daughter Ella Mae was born in April 2023. In December 2024, McCaw&#x27;s family said they were soon to move to Wānaka after 10 years living in Christchurch.

His other sporting passion is flying and he was made an honorary Squadron Leader in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 2010 and was promoted to honorary Wing Commander in September 2016.

McCaw was taught to fly gliders by his grandfather J H &#x27;Jim&#x27; McCaw who flew more than 300 missions in the Second World War. In 2009 he convinced the head of the Discovery network in Australia and New Zealand to do a show about gliding. They filmed McCaw gliding at Omarama on the extreme sports series &quot;Sportstar Insider&quot;, which was hosted by Australian former rugby league footballer Andrew Ettingshausen. After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake he auctioned a personal flying lesson through Trade Me to raise money for the badly damaged Hororata St Johns Church. He is also raising money for a young Samoan who broke his neck playing rugby and whose village was destroyed in the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami. It was revealed at his retirement announcement in 2015 that McCaw would work at Christchurch Helicopters, where he is a Director and Shareholder, and was obtaining a commercial helicopter licence. McCaw has since obtained said licence and has continued working as a helicopter pilot. He flew several rescue and reconnaissance missions following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake that struck the South Island. He also performed milk drops around rural areas of New Zealand while having an endorsement with Fonterra, in which his sister and her husband are dairy farmers.

In 2010, McCaw and Dan Carter were on a NZ$750,000 a year contract that saw them through to the end of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, making them the highest paid rugby players in New Zealand at the time. This contract would still have applied if they had not been selected for the World Cup squad.

==Honours and awards==
In 2019, World Rugby inducted McCaw to its Hall of Fame, alongside Shiggy Konno, Os du Randt, Peter Fatialofa, Graham Henry, and Diego Ormaechea.

===Order of New Zealand===

In December 2011, then Prime Minister John Key revealed that he had asked McCaw about the possibility of a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours, but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, &quot;He made the call that he&#x27;s still in his playing career and it didn&#x27;t feel quite right for him, that day where he&#x27;s no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him.&quot; No formal offer was ultimately made. McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the 2016 New Year Honours. The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time. McCaw represented the Order in the Royal Procession at the 2023 Coronation.

<text>The Job File Table (JFT) is a DOS data structure in the Program Segment Prefix (PSP). It starts at PSP offset 0x18 and is 20 bytes long. For each open file handle, DOS stores the index into the System File Table (SFT). A file handle that is returned by codice_1, codice_2, and other similar functions is simply an index into the JFT where DOS stored the SFT entry index for the file or device that the program opened.

When a program starts, the first 5 entries in the JFT are preconnected to the standard devices. All other handles are marked as closed by setting the value of the entry to 0xFF. The standard devices are initialised as follows:

Handles 0-2 are connected to the console device. During program execution they can get modified (closed, redirected) like any other handle.

Because the size of the JFT in the PSP is limited to 20 bytes, originally only 15 files (20 minus the 5 standard devices) could be open at a time. In MS-DOS 2.0, the Extended Job File Table was introduced, which allowed up to 254 files to be opened.

As of MS-DOS 3.30, the size of the JFT can be modified with a call to codice_3.

<doc id="1006768" wikidata="Q5061508" url="?curid=1006768" title="Central New York">
<text>The central region of New York state includes:
*Auburn in Cayuga County
*Cortland in Cortland County
*Oneida in Madison County
*Syracuse, the largest city of Central New York, in Onondaga County
*Fulton and Oswego in Oswego County

With a population of about 784,283 as of 2020 and an area of , the region includes the Syracuse metropolitan area.

== Definitions ==
The New York State Department of Transportation&#x27;s definition of the Central and Eastern region of New York state includes the counties of Albany, Broome, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Fulton, Greene, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster, and Washington, but does not commit itself to a definition of Central New York.

Cortland County and Tompkins County are often considered part of the New York State region called the Southern Tier; the ski country demarcation line runs through Cortland County. Tompkins County, which includes Ithaca at the edge of Cayuga Lake, is considered part of the Finger Lakes. Oneida County and Herkimer County are often considered part of New York state&#x27;s Mohawk Valley, although Central New York and Mohawk Valley&#x27;s geographic definitions overlap. Only Onondaga County, Cayuga County, Oswego County, and Madison County are always considered Central New York.

Daniel Koch writes in his book, &quot;Land of the Oneidas: Central New York State and the Creation of America&quot;, published in 2023, that &quot;the term &#x27;central New York&#x27; is a confounding one, which has been defined differently by various writers and agencies at different times.&quot; His work on central New York focuses on the homeland of the Oneida people along with the neighboring homelands of the Onondaga people to the west and the Mohawk people to the east.

== History ==
During the early historic period, the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee, Five Nations) successfully excluded Algonquian tribes from the region.

The Central New York Military Tract (land reserved for soldiers of the American Revolution) was located here. Many towns derived from the tracts have classical names.

==Higher education==
Major colleges and universities in the region include: 

*Cornell University
*Colgate University 
*Hamilton College
*Le Moyne College
*SUNY Cortland 
*SUNY ESF
*SUNY Morrisville 
*SUNY Oswego 
*SUNY Polytechnic Institute 
*SUNY Upstate Medical University 
*Syracuse University
*Utica University
*Wells College

== Media ==
Major newspapers in the region include the &quot;Oneida Daily Dispatch&quot;, &quot;Syracuse Post-Standard&quot;, &quot;Auburn Citizen&quot;, &quot;Rome Daily Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Ithaca Journal&quot;, and &quot;Utica Observer-Dispatch&quot;.

The region is served by several television stations based in Syracuse (including ABC affiliate WSYR-TV, NBC affiliate WSTM-TV, CBS affiliate WTVH, Fox affiliate WSYT and PBS member station WCNY-TV) and Utica (NBC/CBS affiliate WKTV, ABC affiliate WUTR and Fox TV affiliate WFXV).

== Speech patterns ==
Central New York is near the eastern edge of the dialect region known as the Inland North, which stretches as far west as Wisconsin. The region is characterized by the shift in vowel pronunciations known as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, although in recent decades the shift has begun to fade out among younger generations.

Many Central New Yorkers pronounce words like &quot;elementary&quot;, &quot;documentary&quot; and &quot;complimentary&quot; with secondary stress on the &quot;-ary&quot;, so &quot;elementary&quot; becomes , instead of the more widespread pronunciations of and . This feature is shared with the rest of Upstate New York.

The word &quot;soda&quot; is used for soft drink in Central New York; this distinguishes it linguistically from Western New York, where &quot;pop&quot; is used.

<text>Burple is a discontinued drink mix that was packaged in an expandable accordion-like plastic container. There were two sizes of Burple available, a lunchbox-size (8 oz, 240 mL) and a full-size (64 oz, 1890 mL) container. It was distributed by Sundale Beverages of Belmont, California and sold mainly in the Midwest.

==Flavours==
The drink was often compared to Kool-Aid and came in the flavors grape, strawberry, cherry, peach, and orange.

==Packaging==
The accordion-like bottle was one of its most distinctive features. To prepare the drink, the container was stretched to expand it to its full size and water was added to the concentrated liquid in the bottle. The bottle would then contract again as you drank from it.

The label included instructions for poking a hole in the cap to convert the container into an ad hoc squirt gun after finishing the drink. &quot;Popular Photography&quot; magazine recommended that the bottles could also be used for darkroom chemicals. &quot;Packaging&quot; magazine reported children finding many other uses for the bottle.

<doc id="1006780" wikidata="Q6973394" url="?curid=1006780" title="National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers">
<text>The National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was established on March 3, 1865, in the United States by Congress to provide care for volunteer soldiers who had been disabled through loss of limb, wounds, disease, or injury during service in the Union forces in the American Civil War. Initially, the Asylum, later called the Home, was planned to have three branches: in the Northeast, in the central area north of the Ohio River, and in what was then considered the Northwest, the present upper Midwest.

The Board of Managers, charged with governance of the Home, added seven more branches between 1870 and 1907 as broader eligibility requirements allowed more veterans to apply for admission. The effects of World War I, which resulted in a new veteran population of over five million men and women, brought dramatic changes to the National Home and all other governmental agencies responsible for veterans&#x27; benefits. In 1930 the Veterans Administration was established, to consolidate all veterans&#x27; programs into a single Federal agency. The several wars since then in the 20th and 21st centuries have resulted in more veterans needing services.

== Beginning of the National Home ==

The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was originally called the National Asylum in the legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in March 1865. The term &quot;asylum&quot; was used in the 19th century for institutions caring for dependent members of society, such as the insane and the poor, who were thought to temporarily have conditions that could be cured or corrected. But, the term had some negative connotations. In January 1873, the Board of Managers gained approval of the name, the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.

From the Revolutionary War through the Civil War, the small number of veterans of American wars had three sources of assistance from the Federal government. The government offered land grants to veterans as compensation for their service, particularly following the Revolutionary War, when it used the land grant system to develop unsettled territories of the new nation. In 1833, the Federal government established the Bureau of Pensions, which made small cash payments to veterans. The low numbers of the veteran population and the more attractive offer of free land kept the pension system relatively small until after the Civil War.

In 1811 the United States Navy was authorized by Congress to establish a permanent shelter for its veterans; construction was started in 1827. The United States Sailors&#x27; Home, located in Philadelphia as part of the Navy Yard, was opened in 1833. In 1827, Secretary of War James Barbour suggested a similar institution for the Army, but Congressional lack of interest and funding meant such a project was delayed.

In 1851, legislation introduced by Jefferson Davis, senator from Mississippi and former secretary of war, was enacted by Congress. It appropriated funds for construction of the United States Soldiers&#x27; Home. The Soldiers&#x27; Home was open to all men who were regular or volunteer members of the army with 20 years&#x27; service and who had contributed to the home&#x27;s support through pay withdrawals.

When the Soldiers&#x27; Home was being organized in 1851 and 1852, it was intended to have at least four branches. Its organization and administration were based on the army&#x27;s command structure and staffed with regular army officers. The Soldiers&#x27; Home was managed by a board of commissioners, although drawn from army officers; each branch had a governor, deputy governor, and secretary-treasure; the members were organized into companies and the daily routine followed the military schedule; all members wore uniforms; and workshops were provided for members wanting or required to work. When the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was being organized in 1866, the National Soldiers&#x27; Home assisted the asylum&#x27;s board by explaining its regulations and offering suggestions.

The Civil War was the first event in the history of the United States considered to be national in the scale of citizen involvement, and in its effects on the daily lives of people communities in both the North and the South. The Civil War was a war of volunteers and draftees, both military and civilian. Very early in the war, it became clear to social leaders in the North that new programs were required to deliver medical care to the wounded beyond what was available through the official military structure.

The leading civilian organization was the United States Sanitary Commission; it secured permission from President Lincoln in the summer of 1861 to deliver medical supplies to the battle front, build field hospitals staffed with volunteer nurses (mostly women), and raise funds to support the commission&#x27;s programs. As the war continued, civilian leaders began to address the issue of caring for the numerous veterans who would require assistance once the war ended. Members of the Sanitary Commission favored the pension system rather than permanent institutional care for the disabled veteran; the commission feared that a permanent institution would become a poorhouse for veterans. Other groups favored as strongly the establishment of a soldiers&#x27; asylum, to ensure provision of quality care. The groups gathered information on European military asylums, particularly the &quot;Invalides&quot; in Paris. They tended to find evidence to support their opinions on either side of the concept of a soldiers&#x27; asylum.

When President Lincoln signed legislation creating the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in March 1865, the nation was in a period of heightened emotional response to the approaching peace. The victory of the Union was seen as the triumph of the nation. The creation of a national institution to serve the veterans was an affirmation of that national victory. When the institution was established, supporters likely had a limited awareness of the potential need among future veterans. But, more than 2,000,000 men served in the Union Army, a third of the white men of military age (13 to 43 years old in 1860). If the number of men disabled in service equaled a sixth of the soldiers who died in the war, the number eligible for admission to the National Asylum would have been more than 300,000.

== Board of Managers (1866–1916) ==
It took time for the new institution to be organized, including design and construction of the building. The original corporation could not secure a quorum for a year after being authorized. In March 1866, Congress passed new legislation to replace the 100-member corporation with a twelve-member board of managers, a more manageable group. Still, they had to select the sites, arrange supervision of construction projects, and designate local officials while serving as unpaid volunteers of an independent Federal agency. The managers of the Asylum looked to past models and local efforts to guide the creation of the institution.

The Board of Managers of the National Asylum met for the first time in Washington, D.C. on May 16, 1866. Their first priority was the selection of sites for the three branches of the national institution, based on geographic distribution. They established criteria for site evaluation: a healthy site with fresh air and ample water supply, located 3 to from a city, and consisting of a tract of at least , connected to the city by a railroad. The Board issued a bulletin to newspapers and to governors of the northern states requesting proposals for sites to be donated or sold for use by the branches. Proposals were due before July 12. In addition, the Board advertised for plans, specifications, and estimates for the construction of asylum buildings.

At the September 1866 Board meeting, General Benjamin Butler, the President of the Board, proposed the purchase of a bankrupt resort at Togus, Maine, near Augusta, as the eastern branch of the Asylum. In regards to a Milwaukee location or a northwestern branch, the Board directed that an executive committee visit the city to select a site. Possible locations for a central branch were discussed.

At the December 7, 1866 meeting of the Board, the executive committee announced its approval of a Milwaukee location. The Board directed them to return to Milwaukee to purchase a site and arrange for the construction of asylum buildings, as well as the transfer of veterans currently housed in the Wisconsin Soldiers&#x27; Home in Milwaukee, operated by the Lady Managers of the Home Society. At the same meeting, the Board approved the purchase of the Togus site. Veterans had already been moved into the former hotel on the site in November 1866. The Central Branch location in Dayton, Ohio, was not selected until September 1867.

The selection of the sites for the three branches was based on three motivations: practical, political and economic. First, the Board needed sites ready to be used immediately before the second winter after the war, and before the time of the November 1866 elections. The Togus site, having been a resort, had a sufficient number of buildings appropriate for housing the disabled veterans. Choosing Dayton as the Central Branch site satisfied the powerful Ohio faction in Congress, as well as the numerous Union generals from Ohio, particularly William Tecumseh Sherman. Locating the Northwestern Branch at Milwaukee resulted in the Board of Managers gaining a large cash donation from the Ladies Managers, enabling them both to purchase a site and have funds left to begin construction.

As the first buildings at the Northwestern Branch were being completed in 1867–1869, the Board of Managers concentrated building efforts at the Central Branch, and in rebuilding facilities at the Eastern Branch, which had been destroyed by fire in 1868. Even though membership had increased in the first few years the Asylum was open, the Board had felt membership would soon begin to decline. The Board-based this on the belief that any veteran who needed the Asylum had already entered it and that, as members regained their health or learned new work skills, they would leave the Asylum. In 1868, the Board adopted a resolution that limited the number of branches to the three existing ones. Problems with construction of the Main Building at the Northwestern Branch, and concern over the harsh winters at both the Northwestern and Eastern branches, led the Board to open a fourth branch in 1870 at a site in a warmer climate; it had existing buildings available for immediate use. In addition, an increasing number of veterans applied for services.

The Southern Branch of the National Asylum was established in October 1870, with the Board&#x27;s purchase of the Chesapeake Female College at Hampton, Virginia. What became the main building of this new branch was built in 1854 and used as the principal facility of the college. The building was used as a hospital for both Union and Confederate troops. In the economic downturn following the Civil War, the women&#x27;s college did not reopen. Acquisition of the property by the National Home followed the precedent four years earlier of the purchase of the Togus resort.

The Southern Branch was founded to provide a facility in a milder climate for the benefit of older veterans, to house Southern black members whom the board believed would be more accustomed to a southern location, and to be associated with Fort Monroe, adjacent to the new branch site. The Federal troops at Fort Monroe and Union veterans at the Southern Branch would establish a strong Union presence near the strategic city of Newport News in the former Confederate state of Virginia.

On January 23, 1873, Congress passed a resolution changing the name of the institution to the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, reflecting the increasing permanence of the institution and its membership. In 1875, the Board&#x27;s report to Congress stressed the need for construction of larger accommodations as quickly as possible. The Broad projected an eventual decline in the population as of the early 1870s, due to an increase in death rate with aging, but also said that it expected more aging veterans to apply for admission in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1875, major construction projects were started at the four branches, in part to provide more housing, but also to provide more hospital facilities to meet the changing medical needs of the members.

Considering the ages for Civil War participants ranged from 13 to 43 years in 1860, the Home could have expected continuing admissions well into the 20th century. The Board indicated a new understanding of the population makeup when it recommended that Congress change the eligibility requirements for admission to the Home by allowing benefits to all destitute soldiers unable to earn a living, without having to trace their disabilities to their military service. The Board realized that denying benefits to this large group of veterans meant their only recourse was the poor house.

In 1883, the Board, recognizing the changes the Home would face with increased membership and increased medical needs of the members, conceded that an &quot;institution like the National Home must in time become an enormous hospital.&quot; It concluded that all new buildings for the Home must be planned with that in mind. As a result, the Board asked for Congressional appropriations to enlarge the hospital at the Central Branch and to build a new hospital at the Southern Branch. At the September 1883 Board meeting, the managers considered asking Congress for the transfer of Fort Riley, Kansas, to the Home as a new facility. They understood the fort was likely to be abandoned since the end of most of the Indian Wars, and it would be easily adaptable to Home use. The Board tabled the motion, but the issue of establishing additional branches of the National Home had been raised.

On July 5, 1884, Congress approved the Board&#x27;s recommendation to change the eligibility requirements for admission, allowing any veterans disabled by old age or disease to apply without having to prove a service-related disability. In effect, the Federal government assumed responsibility of providing care for the aged veterans; what had been established as a temporary asylum for disabled people in 1866, had become a permanent home for the elderly. This legislation provided for expansion of the National Home by authorizing branches to be established west of the Mississippi and on the Pacific Coast.

With the loosening of restrictions, the Home rapidly had an increase of 12% in membership, but it had not gained additional funding from Congress. The Board returned to Congress with a request for deficiency funding, arguing that the Home could either go into debt, which was illegal under its organic law, or it would have to discharge a large number of members to save on expenses.

Expansion at the four original branches proceeded more slowly after 1884. The 1884 Board of Surgeons Report recommended that the Central Branch was already too large and should not be expanded; the severe climate at the Eastern and Northwestern branches should limit their growth; and the Southern branch should not be allowed to grow to more than 1500–2000 members. The surgeons suggested that new branches were a better solution than enlarging the older ones. They also recommended that certain diseases would benefit from treatment at the various branches. The establishment of new branches in the west and on the Pacific coast limited the expansion of the older branches.

In September 1884, the Board selected Leavenworth, Kansas, as a new location, contingent on the city donating a tract of and $50,000 to provide for &quot;ornamentation&quot;; the city accepted in April 1885. At the same meeting, the Board took under consideration the establishment of a Pacific Branch; the Sawtelle Veterans Home opened near Santa Monica, California in January 1888. Even with the creation of two new branches, the Board realized that membership would continue to increase; it proposed four alternatives to manage the needs. Additional branches could be established; existing branches could be enlarged; states could be encouraged to erect state soldiers&#x27; homes through partial funding from the Federal government; and financial relief to veterans outside the Home system could be increased.

Congress established a new Home branch in Grant County, Indiana, on March 23, 1888, with an initial appropriation of $200,000, based on the county residents&#x27; providing natural gas supply sufficient for the heating and lighting of the facility. The site selected was near Marion, Indiana, and the new facility was called the Marion Branch. The Marion Branch was the seventh of ten homes and one sanatorium that were built between 1867 and 1902. These homes were primarily intended to provide shelter for the veterans. The homes gradually developed as complete planned communities, with kitchens, gardens and facilities for livestock, designed to be nearly self-sufficient. It appears that these homes were the first non-religious planned communities in the country.

Additionally, Congress passed legislation to provide $100 annually for every veteran eligible for the National Home who was housed in a state soldiers&#x27; home. In 1895, the Indiana legislature authorized the establishment of a state soldiers&#x27; home, which was built in West Lafayette, Indiana.

The National Home continued to face problems of overcrowding and the need for more specialized medical care. In 1898, Congress approved an eighth branch, to be established at Danville, Illinois. The Mountain Branch was established in 1903 near Johnson City, Tennessee. The last of the National Home facilities was established as the Battle Mountain Sanitariumt at Hot Springs, South Dakota, in 1907. It was not a full-service branch, but a specialized institution open to members from any of the nine branches who had rheumatism or tuberculosis. Neither disease could be cured at the time, but patients were believed to benefit from the dry air prevalent at that location. Between 1900 and 1910, the Board of Managers were directed most of their attention to developing these three new branches.

== 1916–1930 ==
In 1916, the Board of Managers believed that membership had begun to decline, due to aging and deaths of veterans. But, on April 6, 1917, the United States entered World War I. By the time of the armistice on November 11, 1918, almost five million Americans had entered the armed forces. On October 6, 1917, an amendment to the War Risk Insurance Act, originally enacted in 1914 to insure American ships and cargo against risks of war, extended eligibility for National Home membership to all troops serving in the &quot;German War.&quot; Most importantly, it provided that all veterans were entitled to medical, surgical and hospital care by the federal government.

Prior to the 1917 amendment, the only veterans entitled to such medical care were members of the National Home who had access to the Home hospitals. All other veterans were dependent on civilian medical services. The 1917 amendment meant that all veterans were eligible for the same medical care as the members of the National Home. Existing hospital facilities at the ten Home branches were insufficient to care for the potentially high number of World War I veterans needing medical care.

In 1919, the responsibility for veterans&#x27; services was distributed among several agencies: the United States Public Health Service (PHS) took over the provision of medical and hospital services; the Federal Board for Vocational Rehabilitation organized rehabilitation programs; and the War Risk Insurance Bureau managed compensation and insurance payouts. The burden on PHS government hospitals was so great that the Service began to contract with private hospitals to provide health care for veterans.

On March 4, 1921, in response to the need for veterans&#x27; hospitals, Congress appropriated funds to construct additional hospitals for veterans covered by the War Risk Insurance Act amendment. In addition, in 1926 Congress required the Bureau of War Risk Insurance to make allotments to the National Home to fund alterations or improvement to existing Home facilities to care for beneficiaries.

Immediately after the war, the National Home took actions to accommodate the large number of returning veterans:
:1) transformed facilities of two branches into hospitals and classified them for specialized care (Marion for neuropsychiatric cases and Mountain for tuberculosis, which were the two classes of illness with the highest numbers of patients), 
:2) modernized existing facilities and established tuberculosis wards (Central and Pacific); and 
:3) built entirely new hospitals (Northwestern), using funding from the Treasury Department.

In August 1921, Congress established the Veterans Bureau to manage all veterans&#x27; benefits. On April 29, 1922, this agency assumed responsibility for fifty-seven veterans&#x27; hospitals operated by the Public Health Service, as well as nine under construction by the Treasury Department.

The participation of African Americans in World War I and issues of racism in US society added to the complexity of caring for veterans. African Americans pressed their case to the federal government, feeling that their service had created an obligation by the government to help them in the war&#x27;s aftermath. African Americans had difficulty gaining medical care, especially in the South. The federal government authorized construction of what was originally called the &quot;Tuskegee Home&quot;, now the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center, on land adjacent to Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Opened in 1923 with 600 beds, it was intended to serve the 300,000 African-American veterans in the South. The complex eventually had 27 buildings, and more than 2300 beds by 1973.

By 1926, the Board began to see a new trend in veterans&#x27; use of the National Home. For the most part, the World War I veterans were receiving medical treatment and returning to civilian life, rather than entering the domiciliary program for the Home. The Board noted that hospital care costs were almost three times the cost of domiciliary care, and it required large capital investments in hospitals, medical equipment, and professional staff. By 1928, the Board concluded that it was not capable of managing the National Home as a national medical service.

In June 1929, the president of the Board of Managers was appointed to the Federal Commission for Consideration of Government Activities Dealing with Veterans&#x27; Matters. The Commission recommended the founding of the Veterans Administration as a federal agency.

On July 21, 1930, the Veterans Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were consolidated into the Veterans Administration. The National Home was designated the &quot;Home Service.&quot; In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s relief program during the Great Depression put a temporary hold on funding for Veterans Administration construction projects, in favor of projects that could quickly put people to work and be completed more rapidly. Two years later, in August 1935, plans were announced for a $20,000,000 building program for the Veterans Administration. Several of the former National Home branches received funding for new medical treatment buildings, domiciliaries, storage buildings, and garages for staff quarters.

On December 7, 1941, another war brought a new period of change to the former National Home. More citizens were drafted for military service. To meet the demand for services after World War II, and later the Korean and Vietnam wars, the former branches of the National Home were expanded and adapted to serve veterans. To ensure high-quality development and training for personnel, in the postwar years the Veterans Administration and its hospital officials worked to establish medical residency programs at veterans hospitals, accredited through collaboration with local and regional universities.

During its life, the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was also known &quot;officially&quot; as the National Military Home and colloquially as the Old Soldiers Home. The formal organizational name was not changed by statute. But, the mailing address for most branches became &quot;National Military Home,&quot; in the appropriate city and state. In the early days, the designation of &quot;old soldier&quot; had no bearing on an individual veteran&#x27;s age. It was used for all veterans.

==Meals==
Breakfast meals included ham, sausage, corned beef hash, baked beans with pork, beef fricassee with hominy, potatoes. bread, butterine. Dinners might include string beans, lima beans, dried peas, pickles, pies, roast mutton, soups like vegetable or bean, roast beef and crackers. Supper would be a light fare like stewed dried fruits, watermelons, sugar cookies, tea, fresh berries, corn meal or rolled oats with syrup, cheese and biscuits.

The quantities of food required were enormous, including 2,800 pounds of ham for the Sunday breakfast, or 2,950 pounds of sausage. 1,250 pies were eaten for dinner, 800 pounds of bread at each meal, and so forth. Preparing these meals required 126 cooks, 44 bakers, 18 butchers, 22 bread cutters, along with farm hands, dishwashers, servers and gardeners.

<doc id="1006790" wikidata="Q437898" url="?curid=1006790" title="Marcus Tullius Tiro">
<text>Marcus Tullius Tiro (died 4 BC) was first a slave, then a freedman, of Cicero from whom he received his nomen and praenomen. He is frequently mentioned in Cicero&#x27;s letters. After Cicero&#x27;s death Tiro published his former master&#x27;s collected works of letters and speeches. He also wrote a considerable number of books himself, and is thought to have invented an early form of shorthand.

==Life==
The year of Tiro&#x27;s birth is uncertain. Groebe, in the &quot;Realencyclopädie&quot;, places it at 103 BC per a statement in Jerome that Tiro died in his hundredth year; this dating, however, is unlikely given that Cicero&#x27;s letters imply that he was much younger. Moreover, because valuable slaves usually received their freedom within a few years, Kathryn Tempest in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ancient History&quot;, along with William McDermott in &quot;Historia&quot;, place his birth .

There is no clear evidence of Tiro&#x27;s parents or of his status as &quot;verna&quot; (slave born into a master&#x27;s household). That said, he was probably &quot;verna&quot; and various scholars have speculated as to his birth parents. Groebe suggested he could have been born into Cicero&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s household by a prisoner; others have suggested he could have been Cicero&#x27;s son by a slave mistress, but this &quot;should not be taken too seriously&quot;. Literary evidence of Tiro&#x27;s activities grows, due to Cicero&#x27;s letters, for Tiro&#x27;s later life. Cicero frequently refers to Tiro in his letters (more than sixty such letters, with the whole 16th book of Cicero&#x27;s letters to friends included). His duties included taking dictation, deciphering Cicero&#x27;s handwriting and managing his table, as well as his garden and financial affairs.

Tiro&#x27;s first appearance in the Ciceronean corpus is when Cicero seconded him to his brother Quintus Tullius Cicero to write political reports in 54 BC. Some date his manumission to this year, but it is more likely that he was manumitted the next year in April 53 BC. When Tiro was freed, with much celebration, he adopted Cicero&#x27;s &quot;praenomen&quot; (&quot;Marcus&quot;) and &quot;nomen&quot; (&quot;Tullius&quot;); A letter from Cicero to Quintus describing the ceremony is lost, but letters from Quintus commending Cicero for his decision survive. It is possible that Pompey was present in an official capacity.

Afterwards, he accompanied Cicero to Cilicia during Cicero&#x27;s governorship there. On his return from Cilicia in 51 BC, Tiro fell seriously ill; Cicero&#x27;s letters show the strength of their friendship and how Cicero regularly wrote to check on Tiro&#x27;s health. Many of Cicero&#x27;s letters refer with concern to his illnesses.

Tiro not only assisted Cicero in secretarial work, but also helped to proofread manuscripts, supervise copyists, and also help in private and financial matters. In 47 BC, for example, Tiro managed the leasing out of Cicero&#x27;s gardens in Tusculum, oversaw the provision of water to the villa, catalogued the books at Cicero&#x27;s estate, and tried to reconcile Cicero&#x27;s daughter Tullia with her husband. He also was the point of contact for Cicero&#x27;s financial matters: when Cicero divorced Terentia, his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus wrote to Tiro about repayment of Terentia&#x27;s dowry.

He also pursued private ventures: letters to that effect describe such ventures in 44 BC, when he also bought a small farm probably near Puteoli, where Jerome says he died in 4 BC in &quot;his hundredth year&quot;.

==Writings==

After Cicero&#x27;s death, Tiro published some of his patron&#x27;s speeches and letters, along with a collection of jokes and a biography; scholars believe the biography was later used as a main source in the historical works of Plutarch, Tacitus, and Aulus Gellius. He had started collecting and editing Cicero&#x27;s correspondence by 46 or 45 BC. It seems Tiro also was a prolific writer himself: several ancient writers refer to works of Tiro, including a book on grammar. Aulus Gellius says, &quot;[he] wrote several books on the usage and theory of the Latin language and on miscellaneous questions of various kinds,&quot; and quotes him on the difference between Greek and Latin names for certain stars. Asconius Pedianus, in his commentaries on Cicero&#x27;s speeches, refers to a biography of Cicero by Tiro in at least four books, and Plutarch refers to him as a source for two incidents in Cicero&#x27;s life. 

He is credited with inventing the shorthand system of Tironian notes, later used by medieval monks, among others. There is no clear evidence that he did, although Plutarch credits Cicero&#x27;s clerks as the first Romans to record speeches in shorthand.

==Tiro in fiction==
* Tiro appears as a recurring character in Steven Saylor&#x27;s &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; crime fiction series, where he occupies the role of sometime sidekick to Saylor&#x27;s investigator hero, Gordianus the Finder.
* He is the first-person narrator in the three books of Robert Harris&#x27;s biographical-fiction trilogy of Cicero: &quot;Imperium&quot; (2006), &quot;Lustrum&quot; (2009, published in the US as &quot;Conspirata&quot;), and &quot;Dictator&quot; (2015). 
* Tiro appears in several books in the SPQR series by John Maddox Roberts.
* Tiro (spelled Tyro) appears in the television historical drama &quot;Rome&quot;, played by Clive Riche in the episodes &quot;Son of Hades&quot;, &quot;These Being the Words of Marcus Tullius Cicero&quot;, &quot;Heroes of the Republic&quot;, and &quot;Philippi&quot;. This version of Tiro appears to be older than Cicero, and is only freed in Cicero&#x27;s will.

<text>Gondar, also spelled Gonder (Amharic: ጎንደር, &quot;Gonder&quot; or &quot;Gondär&quot;; formerly , &quot;Gʷandar&quot; or &quot;Gʷender&quot;), is a city and woreda in Ethiopia. Located in the North Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, Gondar is north of Lake Tana on the Lesser Angereb River and southwest of the Simien Mountains. , Gondar has an estimated population of 443,156.

Gondar previously served as the capital of both the Ethiopian Empire and the subsequent Begemder Province. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in the Fasil Ghebbi UNESCO World Heritage Site for which Gondar has been called the &quot;Camelot of Africa&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The term Gondar was first mentioned during the reign of Amda Seyon I as the name of a regiment of soldiers stationed (likely in Wegera) to guard nearby trade routes and control a restive population. In 1636, Emperor Fasilides selected Gondar as his katama for the purpose of collecting customs on the trade routes towards the Red Sea. This was the same reason that induced his immediate predecessors, beginning with Emperor Sarsa Dengel in the 1570s, located their capitals on Lake Tana&#x27;s northeastern flank, along with a concern for safety from the Oromo conquests in the central highlands. Situated about 35 km due north of the lake in the midst of Kémant country, Gondar was on, or close to, the point at which the main caravan track from Sudan to Lake Tana joined the route from Ennarea to the Red Sea. Other advantages were a semi-circle of mountains that afforded protection, nearby fertile agricultural lands and a permanent water supply. Popular tradition states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the Angereb, where an &quot;old and venerable hermit&quot; told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site.

=== 17th century ===

Fasilides translocation from Danqaz to Gondar contributed to trading benefits as it was where caravans from Sudan and the Red Sea converged, despite Lent and rainy season prohibiting expeditions that made the emperor stay at the capital. Such incidents quickly enabled him to prolong his reign and construct many buildings for the purpose of giving capital and additional reforms. Within the capital, Fasilides ordered the construction of the imposing edifice known as the Fasil Ghebbi or Fasilides Castle. Further, he established five other churches, including Mädòane Aläm and Fit Abbo. The pleasure-pool with stone pavilion beside the Qaha river known as the &quot;Bath of Fasilides&quot;. In 1648, a Yemeni ambassador, Hassan ibn Ahmad al-Haymi, who visited the palace described it as a great house of stone and lime and &quot;one of marvelous of buildings, worthy of admiration, and the most beautiful of outstanding wonders.&quot; The head stonemason was an Indian named Abdal Kerim who had previously worked on the palace of Emperor Susenyos I in Danqaz. In the newly built castle Al-Haymi saw beds from Constantinople, mattresses from India glittering with gold, sofas inlaid with pieces of jewelry and gems. His eye was also struck by the attire of the courtiers: gowns of silk brocade embroidered with gold, silk gowns, golden girdles &quot;set with marvelous stones and precious gems&quot;, swords from Sennar inlaid with the choicest pure gold. Seeing this wealth, al-Haymi, thought of the prescriptions of Islamic Law according to which men are forbidden to wear gold and silver ornaments, silk garments, and to use silk for beds and chairs.

By the time of Fasilides&#x27; death in 1667, Gondar was so well established that his successor Yohannes I (1667-82) made no attempt to seek out a new capital for himself like the former monarchs. On the contrary, he spent much more time in Gondar then his father had done. Though, he left every year on expeditions before returning to his capital, but spent half the year inside the city. In 1669-70, the Emperor ordered Muslims and Jews to separate from Christians and form their own sectors in Gondar. By 1676, this decree resulted in Muslims settling in the lower town near the Qaha, in a quarter called Eslam Bet or Eslamge. The Beta Israel were assigned four quarters, including Abarra and Kayla Meda, near the Qaha. Key areas in the city included the royal enclosure (Makkabäbiya or Fail Gémb), Addebabay (a public square and market), Abun Bet (home of the abun), Eccäge Bet (residence of the -éccäge and a refuge), Qañn Bet (noble quarters), and Déngay (inhabited by Christian merchants). Yohannes died in July 1682, he &quot;lived for ten days in a great new building&quot; constructed that very year. According to the chronicles, this edifice, which was ornamented in ivory, was built by an Ethiopian architect named Walda Giyorgis who was described as &quot;able, intelligent, and of good renown.&quot;

Yohannes&#x27;s successor, Iyasu I (1682-1706), seems to have been very conscious to maintain the good will of the citizens of Gondar and it was reported that he never closed the doors of his palace, even at night, to give his subjects the impression that he trusted them. Iyasu&#x27;s reign, like that of his father and grandfather, witnessed considerable building in the city. The Emperor was responsible for the erection of a new castle, and several other churches. The castle of Iyasu, which was reportedly erected by Walda Giyorgis, was described as &quot;more beautiful then the house of Solomon.&quot; When Iyasu saw it he is said to have been &quot;full of joy and happiness&quot;. During the reign of Iyasu I, the city&#x27;s population was estimated to have exceeded 60,000.

=== 18th century ===
Gondar prospered until the reign of Tekle Giyorgis (r. 1779–1784), appropriately nicknamed Fäsame Mängest (&quot;the End of Government&quot;). This period was characterized by glorious personalities of Emperors such as Iyasu I, Bakaffa, Mentewab, and Dawit III. All castles and churches were highly centralized for royal nobilities. The French Charles Poncet, who has served as physician of Iyasu, offers wrote extensively about the town at the end of seventeenth century. His journey was important for it gave the outside world some information about the country during the period of its isolation, when the great city of Gondar was built. Poncet was the first European observer to describe the city, the existence of which was doubted in European circles where it was generally thought that Ethiopia still possessed no fixed capital. His third palace, Iyasu Palace also known as &quot;Saddle on Horseback&quot; resembles a saddle—to highlight the emperor&#x27;s horsemanship. As a veteran of eleven battles and tax collector, Iyasu extended his boundary to Egypt, Yemen, and Sudan, and decorated his castle with ivory, mirrors, cedar, and a ceiling covered in gold leaf and precious stones.

After the death of Iyasu I death in 1706, Gondar became to decline because of most emperors preferred to enjoy luxurious life rather than spending in politics, giving the raise of Tigre Province such as the future capital Adwa in mid-eighteenth century. The event could lead of the ascension of major political figures in the period: Emperor Bakaffa and his widow Empress Mentewab and the first Tigre warlord Ras Mikael Sehul. However, the power was presided to Mentewab and the Amhara lords, where several members belonged to her family. They defended that the Empress should enthroned as Regent for her grandson as she had been for her son a decade and half earlier.

Mentewab brought her brother Ras Wolde Leul to Gondar and made him Ras Bitwaded. After the death of Iyasu II on 27 June 1755, Ras Mikael Sehul, who was on the way with guns, carpets, gold, silver and other tribute from Tigre, learnt the news two days later, when they arrived at Sembera Zagan in Wagara. Without any delay, he proceeded to the capital, arriving at morrow, he saw Iyasu II&#x27;s son Iyoas I, who was child at the time of his reign.

On 7 September 1755, an agreement between the Empress and Mikael involving the marriage of his son Dejazmach Wolde Hawaryat to Mentewab&#x27;s daughter Woizero Atlas can be seen as the path to supreme power to Gondar. Unbeknownst to him, Mentewab believed that Mikael could cooperate with her and merge their dynastic alliance without awareness of his power and wealth. Their ceremony was described to be conducted by &quot;great pomp&quot; befitting with daughter of king and queen and &quot;great enjoy&quot; reigned in the House of Tigre ruler. According to chronicle, the marriage took place in Gondar, some three months after the death of Iyasu II and ascension of Iyoas.

The Oromo influence in Gondar rapidly began to increase in the 18th century. The last Gondarine Emperor to exercise full control was Iyasu II, during his reign multiple revolts broke out and it became apparent that the country was on the eve of political chaos. He was succeeded by Iyoas I, who effectively became an Oromo puppet. The city was now guarded by 3,000 Oromo troops and had essentially been taken over by the Oromos. In the face of overwhelming opposition towards the Oromo newcomers, Iyoas was forced to appeal to the powerful warlord Mikael Sehul. Ras Mikael thus became master of Gondar.

In May 1767, Ras Mikael Sehul killed Iyoas and crowned 70 years old Yohannes II, the Empire thus entered a period of supreme difficulty when its authority declined during the Zemene Mesafint. Upon his arrival in 1770, Wolda Hawariat claimed that Gondar had an epidemic of smallpox, where the chief comes to he capital with &quot;ill of fever&quot;.

=== 19th century ===
Accusing Ras Ali II of being aligned to Muslims, Wube Haile Maryam roused his people against Gondar, and seized the town in 1841. Despite being excommunicated by the church, Ras Ali insisted fighting and attempted to enlist an outlaw named Kassa (future Tewodros II) to his cause. Kassa as the future Emperor of Ethiopia, considerate himself as descendant of both Solomon and Alexander the Great by responding fighting Ali. Through this time, Gondar resembled to base of operations rather than a capital, yet there was small European community with one of these was the British Consul, Charles Duncan Cameron.

Starting from Battle of Ayshal in 1852, Kassa refused to order Ras Ali II, who controlled most princes and regions of northern Ethiopia, for his perennial military expedition against Gojjam. In response, Dejazmach Goshu Zewde of Gojjam, an ally of Ras Ali II, clashed with Kassa&#x27;s army at the Battle of Gur Amba (27 November 1852). Ras Ali II left Gondar for Debre Tabor to call troops in rival provinces of Tigray, Wollo, Yejju. Afterward, he returned to Gondar where Kassa had occupied. In the Battle of Takusa (12 April 1853), Kassa pillaged Debre Tabor in 1852. On 29 June, Kassa proceeded destroying Ras Ali II&#x27;s Oromo cavalry in one of costliest battles during the Zemene Mesafint, where Ali II died in 1856 after retreating to Yejju.

In 1854, Kassa Hailu took control of the town and called upon its nobles, citizens and clergy to accept his candidacy to the throne. The city assembly proclaimed him King of Kings and many cattle were slaughtered for the occasion and the Emperor gave alms generously to the poor. Tewodros, found it necessary to fight against local rulers and their followers in other areas, and was not attracted to Gondar which moreover seemed to him a symbol of Ethiopia&#x27;s decadence. In 1864, Tewodros ordered the Muslim inhabitants of the city to convert to Christianity or leave, forcing many of them to flee the country. Relations between Tewodros and Gondar continued to deteriorate because of their suspected complicity in rebellion and the bitter disputes the Emperor had with the clergy. By the end of 1864, Tewodros declared Gondar to be a &quot;town of priests who do not love me!&quot; and ordered the city to be violently sacked and destroyed. His soldiers robbed the priests, burned down their residences, and plundered the monasteries in the former capital.

Emperor Yohannes IV spent the first part of his reign in Debre Tabor as Tewodros had done before him. The disappearance of the Emperor and his court led to a large demographic reduction in the city, Gondar&#x27;s population, well over 60,000 in the 18th century, was said by some observers to have dwindled to only 8,000 in the 1870s. In the late 1880s, Gondar suffered serious blows as a result of fighting with the Mahdist Sudanese. The Ethiopian historian Blatengeta Heruy Wald Selassie, relates that the Mahdists entered the city in January 1888 &quot;and burnt all the churches. Those who were brave were slaughtered on the spot, while the cowardly fled. The remainder, women and children were made prisoners and taken into slavery.&quot; In June of the following year the Mahdists again marched into Gondar and, &quot;massacred the great and the humble, the men and women whom they found.&quot; As a result, Gondar towards the end of the century was thus little more than a ghost town abandoned in ruins.

=== 20th century ===
In early 1900s, peace and stability resulted in some revival in Gondar&#x27;s fortunes. Gondar was favorably situated between Sudan to the west, Addis Ababa to the south, and Eritrea to the north and hence enjoyed a sizeable amount of commerce. With thousands of traders traveling from Gallabat and Adwa, the merchants of Gondar and in Begemder were to find immediate sale for their merchandise. There were Italian representatives residing in Gondar; a merchant named Caremelli imported Italian cotton goods and distributed them in Gondar, and an Italian medical doctor gave free medical service to patients in Gondar. The Arab merchants brought in and sold rifles and revolvers.

The Italian enterprise in Italian Eritrea began Red Sea commerce instructed by Major Ciccodicola, the Italian Minister at Addis Ababa. Some two months, Major Ciccodicola communicated to Emperor Menelik II that Ferdinando Martini (1897–1907) to get permission for extending mule caravan road from Nuqara to Gondar. He also added that at the completion of the road, it would be owned by the Ethiopian government.

In 1930, revolts occurred in Gondar just before Emperor Haile Selassie inauguration were clear attempt to prevent his rule over the area. Haile Selassie then imposed central government in Gondar and Tigray which met resistance to topple the government. On 1 April 1936, the Italian troops occupied Gondar and within two years, 2,000 Europeans lived in the city. Local inhabitants were segregated into districts west and south of the castle enclosure, Italians settling in northern and north-eastern areas. New commercial and government buildings were erected north-east of the castles and a retail district, known henceforth as the &quot;piazza&quot;, was laid out adjacent to the castle compound, all in 1930s &quot;modernist&quot; architecture. A central artery linked the Italian quarters, piazza, Ethiopian merchant quarter, and Saturday market. Another new road ran west of the Fasil &quot;bath&quot; and on to Azezo, where a landing-strip provided an air service with Asmara. Other new roads connected the city with Gojjam and with Eritrea, the latter a paved, all-season roadway. Colonial authorities, seeking to curry favor with local Muslims, built a mosque (for the first time with minaret) beside the Saturday market, authorized the appointment of a gadi for matters involving the Sara and permitted Muslims to settle outside Addis Alem. On 13–17 November 1941, the British and Italian military fought in Gondar during the East African Campaign of World War II, marking the withdrawal of Italian force from Italian East Africa.

In 1944, attempt to introduce land taxes following the Italian evacuation of the area met with military opposition in Gondar and Tigray. By 1950s, the population of Gondar has been fallen to 13,000, with few churches remaining. Still, Gondar was important religious center, becoming poor town with few modern amenities. Gondar traded cotton, saddles, shoes, ornaments, and cloth with other regions of the Blue Nile, but otherwise cut off the world. In 1970s, Gondar and Welega were hit by severe drought while the hardest year was in 1983–86.

The 1974 revolution affected azmaris and social and economic life of Gondar, creating Ethiopian diaspora in various parts of the world. During the Ethiopian Civil War, the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) reported that they actively engaging war against the Derg regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam in the northern province of Gondar.

In February 1989, the Soviet refused to ship more arms, and series of defeat of the Derg evacuated the government from Tigray Province. The TPLF then assembled the Amhara Democratic Party which formed the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and their force advanced to Gondar and Wollo Province. Shortly, They cut Addis Ababa–Gondar road and put Gojjam at risk. On 23 February 1991, the EPRDF launched military offensive codenamed &quot;Operation Tewodros&quot; against government in Gondar. In May 1991, Gondar was occupied by EPRDF forces concurrently with Wollo, Tigray and Gojjam.

=== 21st century ===
As a result of the War in Amhara that began in 2023, Gondar has seen a surge in violent crimes, including robbery, kidnapping, and murder.

On 17 September, Fano launched a large-scale offensive against Gondar, one of the largest cities in the Amhara region. After heavy fighting, Fano claimed to have killed over 100 ENDF soldiers and captured 40. The clashes resulted in the deaths of at least nine people and injuries to more than 30 others. After two days of intense fighting, Fano eventually withdrew from Gondar, as of October 2024 the city remains under Ethiopian government control.

==Cityscape==

Gondar traditionally was divided into several neighborhoods or quarters. These quarters are: Addis Alem, where the Muslim inhabitants dwelt; Kayla Mayda, where the adherents of Beta Israel lived; Abun Bet, centered on the residence of the Abuna, or nominal head of the Ethiopian Church; and Qagn Bet, home to the nobility. Gondar is also a noted center of ecclesiastical learning of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and known for having 44 churches – for many years more than any other settlement in Ethiopia. Gondar and its surrounding countryside constitute the homeland of most Ethiopian Jews.

The modern city of Gondar is popular as a tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. The most famous buildings in the city lie in the Royal Enclosure, which include Fasilides&#x27; castle, Iyasu&#x27;s palace, Dawit&#x27;s Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress Mentewab&#x27;s castle, a chancellery, library and three churches. Near the city lie Fasilides&#x27; Bath, home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the Qusquam complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth century Ras Mikael Sehul&#x27;s Palace and the Debre Berhan Selassie Church.

Downtown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s. The main piazza features shops, a cinema, and other public buildings in a simplified Italian Moderne style still distinctively of the period despite later changes and, frequently, neglect. Villas and flats in the nearby quarter that once housed occupation officials and colonists are also of interest.

== Education ==
The town is home to the University of Gondar, which includes Ethiopia&#x27;s main faculty of medicine. Teda Health Science College is also located at this town.

<text>Samuel Willard Beakes (January 11, 1861 – February 9, 1927) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Life and career==
Beakes was born in Sullivan County, New York to parents Elizabeth Bull and George M. Beakes. He attended Wallkill Academy in Middletown, New York. Beakes graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1883, was admitted to the bar the same year, and commenced practice in Westerville, Ohio.

He was editor and proprietor of the &quot;Westerville Review&quot; in 1884, of the Adrian, Michigan &quot;Daily Record&quot; 1884–1886, and of the Ann Arbor &quot;Argus&quot; 1886–1905.

He was also mayor of Ann Arbor 1888–1890, postmaster of Ann Arbor 1894–1898, city treasurer 1891-1893 and 1903–1905, and city assessor 1906–1913. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention at St. Louis in 1916.

Beakes was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd District to the United States House of Representatives for the Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1913 to March 3, 1917. 

He successfully contested the election of Mark R. Bacon to the Sixty-fifth Congress and served from December 13, 1917, to March 3, 1919. He was defeated by Earl C. Michener for reelection in 1918 to the Sixty-sixth Congress.

After his service in Congress, he resided in Washington, D.C. and was assistant chief of the industrial cooperation service of the United States Department of Commerce from April to July 1919 and a staff member of the United States Veterans&#x27; Bureau from 1919 until his death in Washington, D.C., aged 66.

He is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

<text>The Beautician and the Beast is a 1997 American romantic comedy film directed by Ken Kwapis, written by Todd Graff, and starring Fran Drescher, Timothy Dalton, Lisa Jakub, Ian McNeice, and Patrick Malahide. It tells the story of a New York City beautician who is hired, under the false assumption that she is a science teacher, to tutor the four children of a dictator of a fictional Eastern European nation, played by Timothy Dalton. The film deals with the theme of cultural differences, and takes inspiration from other stories like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Produced by Drescher&#x27;s company High School Sweethearts in partnership with Paramount Pictures, &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was her first starring role in a film.

Drescher chose Graff to write the screenplay because of his familiarity with her style of humor. She pitched and sold the project as a vehicle to transition her career in television to film. Filming took place during the fall of 1996 in Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California, and Sychrov Castle in the Czech Republic. Kwapis consulted with dialect coach Francie Brown to create the fictional language Slovetzian used in the film. Cliff Eidelman composed the soundtrack which features the London Metropolitan Orchestra.

&quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was released on February 7, 1997 to generally negative reviews. Critics panned the story as more appropriate for a sitcom rather than a feature film, and called it a poor example of the romantic comedy genre. Drescher and Dalton received mixed reviews for their performances; Drescher was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was a box-office bomb, grossing roughly $11.5 million against a production budget of $16 million.

==Plot==
The film opens with an animated sequence in which a prince awakens a princess with a kiss, though she rejects his romantic advances and runs away. The scene shifts to live action beautician Joy Miller, who teaches at a New York City beauty school. One of her students accidentally sets the classroom ablaze by igniting hair spray with a cigarette. She escorts her class and some caged animals to safety, prompting the &quot;New York Post&quot; to run a headline praising Joy as a hero. Ira Grushinsky, a diplomat from the Eastern European country Slovetzia, mistakes Joy for a science teacher after seeing a newspaper photo. He hires her as a tutor for the four children of Boris Pochenko, Slovetzia&#x27;s dictator. However, she misinterprets his job offer as teaching hairstyling. Although she has never heard of the country, she accepts the job despite her initial hesitation. After arriving at Slovetzia, Ira is surprised to discover Joy&#x27;s true identity, but she convinces him to keep it a secret.

Despite making a bad first impression with Boris, Joy gets along with his children Katrina, Karl, Masha, and Yuri. While teaching them about life outside Slovetzia, she also helps them to gain confidence in themselves. She learns about Katrina&#x27;s relationship with Alek, the leader of the youth rebellion, and encourages Karl to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Joy frequently clashes with Pochenko, who is disturbed by her independence and his inability to frighten her. Joy and Katrina go to a nightclub which also operates as a base for those planning the rebellion; Prime Minister Leonid Kleist follows the pair and arrests Alek.

Growing closer to Joy, Boris confesses to her that he wants to change his reputation as a &quot;beast&quot; among Western nations; she encourages him to form closer relationships with his citizens and shaves his mustache. During a trip to a factory, Joy realizes that Slovetzia lacks trade unions and encourages the workers to hold a strike. She also arranges a secret meeting between Katrina and Alek in his cell. Despite Leonid&#x27;s advice to fire Joy, she convinces Boris to hold a party for visiting emissaries during a summit meeting to debut his new image; he places her in charge of the preparations. As part of the summit, Boris considers releasing Alek despite Leonid&#x27;s disapproval. On the day of the event, Joy reveals her identity to Boris, but he does not care about her credentials. He thanks her for bringing happiness to him and his family.

During the party, Leonid confronts Joy about her role in Katrina&#x27;s secret meetings with Alek and threatens to have her arrested for treason. Following Boris&#x27; decision to keep Alek in jail, Joy informs him that she had set up meetings between Alek and Katrina; he argues with Joy over her meddling in Slovetzia&#x27;s political affairs. She quits and returns to New York City. Over the course of several weeks, Leonid quietly takes over administrative duties and signs death sentences in Boris&#x27; name. When Ira informs Boris that Leonid is usurping his power, he strips Leonid of his duties and arrests him on charges of treason. Boris reunites with Joy in New York City and informs her that he has freed Alek and agreed to hold free elections in Slovetzia. Boris kisses Joy after admitting his feelings for her.

==Production==

Fran Drescher developed and pitched the concept for &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot;, which she said was a homage to the musical &quot;The King and I&quot; (1951). Drescher was an executive producer for the film, which was handled through her production company High School Sweethearts. The writer Todd Graff was attached to &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; during its pitch; Drescher chose him since they had a similar sense of humor and he was already &quot;familiar with her voice and what type of dialogue suits her best&quot;. While producing the film, Drescher only wanted a script that was &quot;written properly for [her]&quot;. Changes to the script occurred up until shooting started. Roger Birnbaum and Peter Marc Jacobson were also executive producers for the film, and Howard W. Koch, Jr. was a producer alongside Graff.

Drescher pursued her own film project because of the success of her sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; (19931999). Previously, she had only acted in supporting roles, first appearing in the 1977 drama &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;; Joy was her first starring role in a feature film. Worried about the audience&#x27;s response to her move to film, Drescher modeled Joy after her previous performances; she explained: &quot;It was a specific and strategic choice to not have the audience have to work too hard to accept me as another character. I wanted it to be an easy transition so they wouldn&#x27;t have to bite off more than they can chew.&quot; Regarding audience expectations, director Ken Kwapis said Drescher &quot;has had to overcome a lot of skepticism about her voice, her abilities, [and] the specificity of her comedy&quot;. He described the film as &quot;more romantic than comic&quot; and wanted it to introduce Drescher&#x27;s vulnerability and &quot;romantic side&quot; alongside her &quot;loud and brassy&quot; comedy.

Timothy Dalton was announced as part of the cast in July 1996. Although Drescher had initially imagined Kevin Kline as Boris, he was unavailable. Kwapis said that Dalton had &quot;a lot of charm and a very gentle tone&quot;. Comedian Laura House considered his casting to be &quot;a testament to the time&quot;, writing &quot;that&#x27;s how popular Fran Drescher was&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Will Harris classified &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; as one of Dalton&#x27;s lighter and more comedic projects. During a 2014 interview, Dalton shared that he had a positive experience during the filming and praised Drescher for her comic timing. Describing herself as &quot;very protective&quot; of Dalton during the filming, Drescher helped him with the comedy and ensured that he had enough funny lines.

&quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was filmed in Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California, Prague, and Sychrov Castle in the Czech Republic. The scenes in the Czech Republic were shot in the fall of 1996; during filming, Drescher hired a chef from Tuscany to prepare meals for her. Peter Lyons Collister handled the cinematography, and Jon Poll was the editor. Kwapis recruited dialect coach Francie Brown to construct the fictional language Slovetzian; it contains influences from Czech, Russian, and Hungarian. &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was completed on a budget of $16 million. Its final cut is 107 minutes long.

==Themes==
Fran Drescher attributed the film&#x27;s humor to the &quot;juxtaposition of her colorful American character onto a dark, oppressive-looking castle&quot;. According to film critic Emanuel Levy, the film personifies a &quot;culture clash of Western democracy vs. rigid and inefficient communism&quot; through Joy and Boris. Levy wrote that Joy pushes Slovetzia into &quot;the liberal, technologically advanced 21st century&quot;, and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;&#x27;s Stephen Hunter characterized her as the &quot;very spirit of liberalism&quot; and the &quot;distilled essence of yenta&quot;. Critics have compared Boris to Joseph Stalin. Hunter believed the comparison was intentional given his &quot;tunic, brush cut, inscrutable expression and pious delta of mustache&quot;, but added that these markers are quickly dropped to emphasize his transformation into a more democratic leader and &quot;a wild and crazy guy&quot;.

Some critics have cited &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; as an adaptation of the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, while others believed &quot;The Nanny&quot; was its inspiration. The film was likened to the stage musicals &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1959) due to its focus on gender and cultural differences. Barry Monush, a researcher for the Paley Center for Media, highlighted the scene in which Joy creates clothing from Ralph Lauren bedding as the most obvious allusion to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Levy interpreted &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; as a &quot;musical without songs&quot;. The film was compared to Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940), and music columnist David Hirsch wrote that the movie&#x27;s soundtrack was similar to those in 1940s films. Katrina&#x27;s relationship with Alek was likened to Juliet&#x27;s romance with Romeo in the play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, while the opening animation was seen as a parody of the Disney films &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959).

==Music==

The soundtrack for &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was composed by Cliff Eidelman and recorded at the CTS Studios in Wembley, United Kingdom. Its 19 songs feature the London Metropolitan Orchestra. The score incorporates elements of Russian classical music and waltz. Eidelman composed 17 of the tracks, while the remaining two—&quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot; and &quot;The J Waltz&quot;—are traditional works by composers Pierre De Geyter and Jerry Graff, respectively. A choir is featured on &quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot;. John Beal composed the film&#x27;s trailer music; although it was not included on the soundtrack, the track was later released on a compilation album of Beal&#x27;s trailer music.

Milan Records released the soundtrack on February 11, 1997, as an audio CD; it was later made available through the music streaming service Spotify. The soundtrack received mixed critical reviews. Hirsch praised it as a &quot;charmingly old-fashioned romantic score&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny commended Eidelman for not relying on the &quot;sweetness and sentimentality that capsize so many comedic scores&quot;, but he criticized the melodies as &quot;leaden and unfocused, with none of the effervescence the genre demands&quot;.

==Release and box office==
The premiere of &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was held in Hollywood on February 4, 1997. The film had received a PG film rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) following a review at a Paramount screening room in Los Angeles. It received a wide release on February 7, 1997, through Paramount Pictures as a Koch Company production, and was shown in 1,801 theaters. Emanuel Levy believed the film was intended for &quot;the Valentine&#x27;s Day dating crowd&quot;.

&quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; opened at number three in the United States box office, and grossed $4.1 million on its opening weekend. It earned $11,486,880 during its theatrical run; in 2015, Box Office Mojo estimated the film made $22,548,300 when adjusted for ticket price inflation. &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; failed to meet its budget and was considered a box-office bomb. Drescher attributed the poor box office returns to the film debuting at the same time as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Special Edition&quot; remaster.

The VHS release debuted at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Video Sales chart on March 21, 1998. Drescher provided audio commentary for the DVD version, which was released on June 24, 2003. &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was made available for purchase on Amazon Prime Video; it was also released on streaming services Netflix, between April 2015 and October 2015, and HBO Max upon its launch in 2020. In a 2020 interview, Drescher said the film continues to provide revenue for Paramount Pictures and has developed a following. According to Drescher, Paramount Pictures president Sherry Lansing described the film&#x27;s longevity as evident through its high video and cable sales.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; received primarily negative responses, holding a score of 22% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, praising Drescher&#x27;s performance but saying audiences would be unable to empathize with her character, since &quot;we never feel she&#x27;s really uncertain, insecure or vulnerable&quot;. Film.com&#x27;s Eric Snider criticized the plot for lacking humor and character development. In a negative review of the script, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Gene Siskel wished that the film was smarter with its parody of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Maitland McDonagh and &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Arnold T. Blumberg considered &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; to be inoffensive and fluffy enough to be enjoyable.&quot;&quot; In a review for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Carrie Rickey described the film as the &quot;tastykake of snack movies&quot; and &quot;shameless and intermittently funny&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Reviewers criticized the film as too similar to a sitcom, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Stephen Holden who said Kwapis and Graff did not elevate the material enough to justify a theatrical release. In an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article, Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; and the 1997 film &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; were &quot;hampered, to greater or lesser degree, by the synthetic conceits of their stretched-out stories&quot;. Commentators felt Joy was just a copy of Fran Fine, Drescher&#x27;s character on &quot;The Nanny&quot;, and believed the film was a poor example of the romantic comedy genre. The &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;″s Duncan Shepherd dismissed &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; as an &quot;inverted and cut-rate &quot;Ninotchka&quot;&quot;. Describing the film as a &quot;dated &#x27;90s [romantic comedy]&quot;, Grace Montgomery, writing for Common Sense Media, said it relied too much on clichés and stereotypes. In a 2015 listicle, &quot;Refinery29&quot;&#x27;s Erin Donnelly included Joy and Boris among those romantic comedy pairings which lacked chemistry. However, in the same year, Lauren Le Vine for the same publication considered the film a classic, and praised the chemistry between Drescher and Dalton as an &quot;awkward friction&quot;.

Drescher&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews. Emanuel Levy praised Drescher as &quot;a warm, funny and likable performer&quot;, although he believed she was too old to play an ingénue. Levy likened her voice and Jewish mannerisms to Fanny Brice and Barbra Streisand. Praising the film for having the &quot;postwar naivete&quot; of the 1950s film, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s John Petrakis wrote that Drescher&#x27;s style, specifically her &quot;big hair, thick makeup, loud clothes, and bizarre voice&quot;, was reminiscent of Judy Holliday. In more negative comparisons, Jeff Vice called Drescher and Dalton inferior actors to Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, respectively, and Eric Snider panned her role as &quot;a hell-spawned, snort-laughing Mary Poppins&quot;. Drescher&#x27;s voice was the frequent subject of criticism; Maitland McDonagh said she had a &quot;nasal honk [that] could shatter crystal&quot;, but believed her fans would enjoy her performance. Drescher received a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for the 18th Golden Raspberry Awards.

Critics also had mixed reviews for Dalton&#x27;s performance. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Rita Kempley praised Dalton for his campy style, and the &quot;Deseret News&quot;″ Jeff Vice wrote that he had &quot;well-chosen facial expressions and some subtle nuances&quot;. Despite finding Dalton to be &quot;eventually amiable&quot;, Stephen Hunter said &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; was not a star-making vehicle for him. In a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, John Anderson enjoyed Dalton&#x27;s comedic acting, but wrote that &quot;everyone ... comes off as stiff next to Drescher&quot;. Maitland McDonagh considered Dalton too serious, however, believing he cast &quot;a damper on the strenuously lighthearted goings-on&quot;. In the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot;, a writer said Dalton had a &quot;constipated scowl&quot;, which they felt was an &quot;appropriate mood for sitting through &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot;&quot;.

<text>The Program Segment Prefix (PSP) is a data structure used in DOS systems to store the state of a program. It resembles the Zero Page in the CP/M operating system. The PSP has the following structure:

The PSP is most often used to get the command line arguments of a DOS program; for example, the command &quot;FOO.EXE /A /F&quot; executes FOO.EXE with the arguments &#x27;/A&#x27; and &#x27;/F&#x27;.

If the PSP entry for the command line length is non-zero and the pointer to the environment segment is neither 0000h nor FFFFh, programs should first try to retrieve the command line from the environment variable %CMDLINE% before extracting it from the PSP. This way, it is possible to pass command lines longer than 126 characters to applications.

The segment address of the PSP is passed in the DS register when the program is executed. It can also be determined later by using Int 21h function 51h or Int 21h function 62h. Either function will return the PSP address in register BX.

Alternatively, in .COM programs loaded at offset codice_1, one can address the PSP directly just by using the offsets listed above. Offset codice_2 points to the beginning of the PSP, codice_3 points to the end, etc.

For example, the following code displays the command line arguments:
org 100h ; .COM - not using ds

; INT 21h subfunction 9 requires &#x27;$&#x27; to terminate string
xor bx,bx
mov bl,[80h]
cmp bl,7Eh
 ja exit ; preventing overflow

mov byte [bx+81h],&#x27;$&#x27;

; print the string
mov ah,9
mov dx,81h
int 21h

exit:
mov ax,4C00h ; subfunction 4C
int 21h
In DOS 1.x, it was necessary for the CS (Code Segment) register to contain the same segment as the PSP at program termination, thus standard programming practice involved saving the DS register (since the DS register is loaded with the PSP segment) along with a zero word to the stack at program start and terminating the program with a RETF instruction, which would pop the saved segment value off the stack and jump to address 0 of the PSP, which contained an INT 20h instruction.
; save
push ds
xor ax,ax
push ax

; move to the default data group (@data)
mov ax,@data
mov ds,ax

; print message in mess1 (21h subfunction 9)
mov dx,mess1
mov ah,9
int 21h

retf
If the executable was a .COM file, this procedure was unnecessary and the program could be terminated merely with a direct INT 20h instruction or else calling INT 21h function 0. However, the programmer still had to ensure that the CS register contained the segment address of the PSP at program termination. Thus,
jmp start

mess1 db &#x27;Hello world!$&#x27;

start:
mov dx,mess1
mov ah,9
int 21h

int 20h
In DOS 2.x and higher, program termination was accomplished instead with INT 21h function 4Ch which did not require the CS register to contain the segment value of the PSP.

<doc id="1006828" wikidata="Q601160" url="?curid=1006828" title="Sauble Beach, Ontario">
<text>Sauble Beach (pop. 2000) is a beach community and unincorporated area in the town of South Bruce Peninsula, Bruce County, in the northern area of southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is on the Bruce Peninsula, along the eastern shore of Lake Huron, on the north edge of the Saugeen First Nation. The beach takes its name from that given by early French explorers to the sandy Sauble River, originally &quot;La Rivière Au Sable&quot; (sand river) also indicating that the river emptied into Lake Huron at a sandy beach. The river was labelled with the French name on maps until 1881, when it became the Sauble River; in early years, a sawmill was built on the river, and later, a hydro electric plant.

==History==
Long before any settlers arrived, the Anishinabek of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation looking for a shorter and safer route between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, would cross the peninsula near its base. They would enter near the site of the present-day location of the town of Wiarton and after portaging, would paddle their canoes across the lakes and rivers that almost connect both shores. The route became known as the Rankin Portage and it is suspected that early French explorers used this route to visit the various indigenous communities, which existed in the area and avoid the often-treacherous waters around the tip of the peninsula.

The last portage on the route was around a waterfall near the Lake Huron coast. The French explorers named the river, “La Riviere au Sable”, which translates to “the river to the sand”. This name continued until 1881 when a mapmaker, perhaps inadvertently, marked the river with the name “Sauble.”

The first settler is reported to have been John Eldridge, who built a cottage nearby in 1877. Other settlers followed and the village continued to grow with a boarding house and then a store. In the 1900s a large sawmill below the falls on the Sauble River employed 40 people. Initially, development was to the south and later to the east of the river. By the early decades of the 1900s, Sauble Beach was attracting visitors because of its gorgeous beaches; this grew as an increasing number of families acquired automobiles. In 2020 as chronicled in the Netflix series Motel Makeover, The June Motel opened at the former Knights Inn.

==Beach and other activities==
At over long, Sauble Beach is said to be the second longest freshwater beach in Canada after Wasaga Beach.

A phenomenon of sandbar deposits building out along the Lake Huron shoreline keeps the water at Sauble very shallow and warm. This is one of the very few beaches in Ontario where cars were, until recently, allowed to drive and park on the sand near the water, at least on the side (left of the entrance) that is part of the Saugeen First Nation native lands. In 2019, however, the First Nation also banned beach parking.

Recreational activities include swimming, windsurfing, water-skiing, fishing, golfing, lawn bowling, tennis, street dances, beach volleyball, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and birding. The town hosts an annual Winterfest. In summer, there are weekly Family Movie Nights, an annual sandcastle building contest, Cruise Nights on Tuesdays, a Sauble Beach Guitar Festival and an 8 km Walk/Run. The Festival of the Classical Guitar has been held since 2007.

The Canadian National (Beach) Volleyball Championships have been held there, and the local Sauble Speedway (with a Hepworth, Ontario address) was on the CASCAR professional racing circuit. The Speedway was purchased by new owners in 2017 and they obtained NASCAR sanctioning in 2018.

A 2023 publication stated that Sauble Beach receives approximately 400,000 tourists annually.

Sauble Beach is the permanent year-round home to approximately 2,000 people. The cottage owners add thousands of seasonal community members, some who stay through the spring to fall time period and others who retreat to Sauble on weekends. In summer, the visitor count increases to over 30,000 on hot weekends and up to 60,000 on a long weekend.

=== Land ownership ===
Cottage owners are split between those who own a property outright and those with cottages on Native lands. A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation, who also refer to themselves as the &quot;Chippewas of Saugeen&quot;, and those who had built seasonal homes on the Native land in the lakeside area between urban Southampton, Ontario and Sauble Beach. There are approximately 1,200 such cottages. Each cottager on Native land pays an annual fee to the First Nation. A lease contract between the cottagers and two Saugeen First Nation Reserves, Chief&#x27;s Point 28 and Saugeen 29, expired on 30 April 2021.
Some years ago, the Saugeen First Nation successfully reclaimed the land that &quot;runs south from the Sauble Beach sign toward Southampton, 18 kilometres away&quot;. The beach area to the south of Main St. in the community is referred to by the band as Sauble Park or South Sauble Beach Park. In addition to the south Sauble Beach area, the Saugeen First Nation claims the rights to another stretch of the public beach, approximately 2 km long, west of Lakeshore Boulevard extending to a point between 1st St. South and 6th St. North. This claim has been in litigation since 1990 when the federal government started an action on behalf of the Saugeen First Nation, stating that the area is part of the Saugeen 29 Reserve. The band also filed its own claim in 1995.

On 4 April 2023, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the waterfront area between 1st and 6th is part of the Saugeen reserve, owned by the Saugeen First Nation. The court also ruled that the Government of Canada had abrogated the 1854 Treaty by allowing the beach waterfront to be taken away from the Saugeen. The Town of South Bruce Peninsula council subsequently voted unanimously to appeal the court decision. Later in April 2023, the appeal was filed by the Town and some landowners, requesting that the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment declaring the relevant section of Sauble Beach as First Nation reserve land.

==Business and community services==

Local businesses offer retail and services for hardware, appliance and grocery shopping, restaurants and hotels, fire and police services, daycare and a medical clinic. Fire Station 40 is located at 21 Sauble Falls Parkway. The town is policed by the Ontario Provincial Police whose office is in the same building as the fire station.

The town is home to the June Motel, a boutique motel featured in the 2021 Netflix series Motel Makeover.

==Education==
There is only one school in town under the Bluewater District School Board. Amabel-Sauble Community School was built in 1995 as an experiment in joint ownership between the board and the Township of Amabel (now part of South Bruce Peninsula); the school provides primary curriculum from Jr. Kindergarten to Grade 8. The closest secondary school is Peninsula Shores District School in Wiarton, Ontario. There are no Roman Catholic schools in town; the closest schools with the Bruce-Grey Catholic District School Board are in Port Elgin, Ontario, and Owen Sound, Ontario. The closest post-secondary institution is Georgian College&#x27;s Owen Sound, Ontario, campus.

==Politics==
Sauble Beach is represented by two councillors for Wards 1 and 3 on the Town Council for South Bruce Peninsula in Wiarton, Ontario. There has been friction between the Town of South Bruce and the Saugeen First Nation because of continuing land claims in the Sauble Beach area. A settlement was mediated in 2014 but was subsequently rejected by South Bruce, leading to a lawsuit against the Town, to be heard in court no earlier than 2018. There has also been conflict regarding environmental protection of sensitive dunes and protected species that are located on the beach. Local residents and members of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation protested plans to alter the dunes in December 2020. One resident asked for a judicial review of the work.

Provincially and federally, the area is part of the riding of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound.

==Transportation==
There is no public transit in Sauble Beach and residents are car-dependent.

A few roads serve the area:

* Main Street/Bruce County Road 8
* Lakeshore Boulevard North
* Sauble Falls Parkway/Southampton Parkway

==Notable people==

<text>The Kemah Boardwalk is a 60-acre Texas Gulf Coast theme park in Kemah, Texas, approximately 30 miles southeast of Downtown Houston, Texas. The Boardwalk is built entirely along the shores of Galveston Bay and Clear Lake. The complex is owned and operated by Landry&#x27;s, Inc., and has restaurants, rides, midway games, a boutique hotel, a charter yacht, a 400-slip marina and shops. There is no charge to walk on the boardwalk. Tickets are sold for rides.

==History==
Landry&#x27;s, Inc. acquired property along the Kemah Waterfront in 1997 and opened the Kemah Boardwalk in 1998. In 2007, the Boardwalk Bullet, a high-speed wooden roller coaster opened on the boardwalk. The 96-foot-tall, 3,236-foot-long roller coaster is built on a 1-acre footprint, making it one of the most compact roller coasters in the world.

A new source published on December 27 of 2012 stated how an evacuation happened because of a device that was spotted on the boardwalk near southeast of Houston on Galveston. The police got everyone out safely and said it was just a military device.

The missing body of a five year old by the name of Fiona was found in the water near the Kemah Broadwalk. She was last seen on the marina dock with her father before going missing. There was no foul play found in the autopsy.

<text>Manly Wade Wellman (May 21, 1903 – April 5, 1986) was an American writer. While his science fiction and fantasy stories appeared in such pulps as &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot; and &quot;Strange Stories&quot;, Wellman is best remembered as one of the most popular contributors to the legendary &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and for his fantasy and horror stories set in the Appalachian Mountains, which draw on the native folklore of that region. Karl Edward Wagner referred to him as &quot;the dean of fantasy writers.&quot; Wellman also wrote in a wide variety of other genres, including historical fiction, detective fiction, western fiction, juvenile fiction, and non-fiction.

Wellman was a long-time resident of North Carolina. He received many awards, including the World Fantasy Award and Edgar Allan Poe Award. In 2013, the North Carolina Speculative Fiction Foundation inaugurated an award named after him to honor other North Carolina authors of science fiction and fantasy.

Three of Wellman&#x27;s most famous recurring protagonists are John, a.k.a. John the Balladeer, a.k.a. &quot;Silver John&quot;, a wandering backwoods minstrel with a silver-stringed guitar; the elderly &quot;occult detective&quot; Judge Pursuivant; and John Thunstone, also an occult investigator.

Wellman wrote under a number of pseudonyms, including Gabriel Barclay, Levi Crow, Gans T. Field, Hampton Wells, and Wade Wells.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Wellman was born in the village of Kamundongo, near the city of Silva Porto in Portuguese West Africa (now Angola). Wellman&#x27;s father, Frederick Creighton Wellman, was stationed in the village as a medical officer. He spoke a local language before he learned English, and became an adopted son of a powerful chief whose vision Dr Wellman restored. As a small child, Manly twice visited London, where the family stayed in Torrington Square (obliterated during the Battle of Britain). When he was still a young boy, his family moved to the United States, where he attended school in Washington, D.C., and prep school in Salt Lake City. After graduating from Fairmount College (now Wichita State University in Kansas) with a BA in English in 1926, he received a Bachelor of Literature degree from the School of Journalism at Columbia University in 1927. A distinguished football player, he received little encouragement from either family or teachers for his plans to become a writer. An early story, &quot;Back to the Beast&quot;, resulted in one teacher remarking &quot;Your work is impossible!&quot; Yet this same story became his first professional sale when editor Farnsworth Wright bought it and published it in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (November 1927).

He was of partial Native American ancestry. According to the author note by Gahan Wilson in Gahan Wilson, ed. &quot;First World Fantasy Awards&quot; (NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 253), Wellman&#x27;s &quot;ancestry reaches back through the Confederate South to colonial Virginia, with the potent infusion of Gascon French and American Indian.&quot;

One of Wellman&#x27;s brothers, Paul Wellman, was also a well published author; another, Frederick Lovejoy Wellman, was a noted plant pathologist.

===The 1920s and 1930s===
His first published story, &quot;When the Lion Roared&quot; (&quot;Thrilling Tales&quot;, May 1927), was based on the stories told to him in his African childhood upbringing. Wellman&#x27;s first science fiction novel, &quot;The Invading Asteroid&quot;, was published in 1929 but he would not work at full length again until 1941.

Around that time he started a friendship with Vance Randolph, an acclaimed folklorist and expert on Ozark mountain magic and traditions. Randolf took Wellman on trips through the Arkansas Ozarks, learning folk traditions and meeting the secluded people of the American back country. It was through Randolph that Wellman met North Carolinian folk music legend Obray Ramsey, whose music would have a profound effect on Wellman and his writing.

In the late 1920s, during the silent film era, Wellman wrote movie reviews for the &quot;Wichita Beacon&quot; and also worked for &quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot; as a court and crime reporter. He sold many stories in this period to &quot;Ozark Stories&quot; and &quot;Thrilling Tales&quot;. He married Frances Obrist on June 14, 1930. Writing under the pen name &quot;Garfield&quot;, she became a horror writer in her own right when she sold her first story to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1939. During the Depression, Wellman&#x27;s newspaper work started to dwindle, so in 1934 he moved from Kansas to New York City where he became assistant director of the WPA&#x27;s New York Folklore Project.

Alfred Bester described meeting Wellman in about 1939: &quot;Mort Weisinger introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties... The vivacious &quot;compère&quot; of those luncheons was Manley [sic] Wade Wellman, a professional Southerner full of regional anecdotes. It&#x27;s my recollection that one of his hands was slightly shriveled, which may have been why he came on so strong for the Confederate cause. We were all very patient with that; after all, our side won the war. Wellman was quite the man-of-the-world for the innocent thirties; he always ordered wine with his lunch.&quot;

Moving from New York to New Jersey in 1939, Wellman wrote countless stories for the new field of comic books as well as for the pulps. During the war he served in New Jersey as a first lieutenant.

===The 1940s: New York, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, occult detectives and comic books===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Wellman began selling to the bigger publications such as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. At this time, when Wellman was living in New York, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published numerous stories based on three of his most famous characters: Judge Pursuivant, John Thunstone, and Professor Nathan Enderby.

Judge Keith Hilary Pursuivant (written under the pen name Gans T. Fields) is described as &quot;a renowned scholar and retired judge, hero of World War I, and now hero of darker, more dangerous battles. Huge of frame, an epicure, an authority on the occult, Pursuivant strides forth from his reclusive home in West Virginia to confront evil wherever it appears.&quot;

John Thunstone is &quot;a hulking Manhattanite playboy and dilettante, a serious student of the occult and a two-fisted brawler ready to take on any enemy. Armed with potent charms and a silver swordcane, Thunstone stalks supernatural perils in the posh night clubs and seedy hotels of New York, or in backwater towns lost in the countryside-- seeking out deadly sorcery as a hunter pursues a man-killer beast.&quot; Thunstone&#x27;s arch-nemesis was the evil sorcerer Rowley Thorne. Thorne was based on the real-life occultist Aleister Crowley, the self-proclaimed &quot;wickedest man in the world&quot;.

The lesser-known character Professor Nathan Enderby is a &quot;slender savant and unassuming authority on the supernatural, aided by his sharp wits and his Chinese servant, Quong. His cabin in rural Pennsylvania is a retreat from the frenetic social life of New York City – and a fortress against the powers of black magic.&quot;

While the Edmond Hamilton-led pulp &quot;Captain Future&quot; was a going concern, Wellman wrote one novel for it, &quot;The Solar Invasion&quot;. When &quot;Captain Future&quot; was cancelled due to wartime paper shortages, the novel was instead published in &quot;Startling Stories&quot; (fall of 1946).
Following a similar path to such pulp writers as Frank Belknap Long, Wellman also wrote for various comic books (what he called &quot;squinkies&quot;) and wrote the first issue of &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; for Fawcett Publishers. Later he would be called into court to testify against Fawcett in a lawsuit by National Comics Publications (later DC Comics) about plagiarism of Superman by the creators of Captain Marvel. Wellman testified that his editors had encouraged their writers to use Superman as the model for Captain Marvel. Though it took three years, National won their case. He also contributed to the writing of the comic book &quot;The Spirit&quot; while the franchise&#x27;s creator, Will Eisner, was serving in the US military during World War II. Wellman also wrote for the comic &quot;Blackhawk&quot;.

Wellman made a return to novel-writing in the 1940s, publishing two full-length science fiction works, &quot;Sojarr of Titan&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Asteroid&quot;. In this decade he published several mystery novels, one a film tie-in.

Amongst Wellman&#x27;s writer friends during the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; years were Malcolm Jameson, Seabury Quinn, Henry Kuttner, and Otto Binder. Wellman used to meet with these writers in a German restaurant in Times Square on a regular basis. He described these friendships as being &quot;like a brotherhood&quot;.

In 1946 Wellman won the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine Award over William Faulkner for his Native American detective tale &quot;A Star for a Warrior&quot;. Apparently Faulkner was quite upset to be second fiddle to a science fiction and horror writer. Faulkner indignantly wrote to the editors of the magazine, proclaiming that he was the father of the French literary movement and the most important American writer in Europe.

Wellman&#x27;s 1956 nonfiction historical work &quot;Rebel Boast&quot; was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

Throughout this period Wellman worked as a harvest hand, cowboy, roadhouse bouncer and newspaperman.

===The 1950s: North Carolina, juveniles, science fiction and non-fiction===

After serving as a lieutenant in World War II, in 1951 Wellman moved his family to Pinebluff, North Carolina. There he immersed himself in American southern mountain folklore and history, becoming an expert on the Civil War and the historic regions and peoples of the Old South. Later in 1951, he made his final move to the college town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Wellman built a vacation cabin on what he called Yandro Mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains next to his friend Obray Ramsey&#x27;s home.

Wellman worked at many jobs to support himself while he wrote, though he sold many stories and books. His jobs included working on farms, in cotton gins, and working as a bouncer in a dance hall.

During this time, Wellman wrote a number of books that are considered regional classics today. Such books, drawn from his rich knowledge of Southern history, include the critically acclaimed account of the great steamboat race between the &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; and the &quot;Natchez&quot;.

Wellman&#x27;s best-known biographical work, &quot;Giant in Gray&quot; (1949), was based on his namesake, Confederate General Wade Hampton. Wellman wrote and published significant nonfiction works about the Old South, including county histories, throughout the 1950s and would continue to do so through to the 1970s.

Most of Wellman&#x27;s work in the 1950s was devoted to young adult stories and science fiction novels. He produced no fewer than five science fiction novels in this decade, though one was a version of a long story previously published in the pulps. Two of his short stories were filmed in this decade for the television show &quot;Lights Out&quot;. He also wrote a western novel, &quot;Fort Sun Dance&quot; (1955), apparently his only venture into that genre.

===The 1960s: science fiction and Silver John===

Wellman wrote two science fiction novels in the sixties – &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; and also &quot;Candle of the Wicked&quot; (1960), which novelized the events leading up to the discovery of the Bender killings. His Captain Future novel &quot;The Solar Invasion&quot; was reprinted in paperback.

His best-known series dates from this period; it is composed of stories featuring the Appalachian woodsman and minstrel hero known as &quot;John&quot;. They were first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. The first stories of John were collected in &quot;Who Fears the Devil?&quot; (1963), based on the personal enthusiasm of August Derleth. Although Wellman only ever called the character &quot;John&quot; or &quot;John the guitar picker&quot;, his later publishers Doubleday and Dell labelled the series Silver John as they felt the name was a better way of marketing the books.

===The 1970s and &#x27;80s: resurgence and twilight years===
The 1970s and 1980s marked a resurgence in Wellman&#x27;s output and an increased attention to his legacy. Much of his best short general fantasy work over the years was collected by Karl Edward Wagner in &quot;Worse Things Waiting&quot; (1973), which won Wellman a World Fantasy Award and revived interest in his work. His 1975 novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; War of the Worlds&quot; was collected from a series of Sherlock Holmes pastiche stories co-written with his son Wade Wellman and originally published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;

Between 1979 and 1984 Wellman wrote five new novels featuring Silver John and in roughly the same period produced two full-length novels featuring his character John Thunstone, as well as seeing Thunstone&#x27;s short adventures, and those of characters such as Judge Pursuivant, collected from the pulps in &quot;Lonely Vigils&quot; (1981). A movie based on the Silver John stories, &quot;The Legend of Hillbilly John&quot;, was released in 1973.

In 1980 Wellman received the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.

Wellman was Guest of Honour (with Gene Wolfe and Rowena Merrill) at the World Fantasy Convention 1983 in Chicago.

At age 82, on June 15, 1985, Wellman suffered a serious fall and sustained severe fractures of his left elbow and shoulder which made him an invalid. A benefit auction for the ailing author was held in London at the annual Christmas Party of the British Fantasy Society and the funds raised sent to Wellman and his wife in a Christmas card. Due to the onset of gangrene in his legs following double amputation, Wellman&#x27;s health failed further and he died at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on April 5, 1986. Before his death he had been able to finish his historical novel &quot;Cahena&quot; about a medieval African warrior princess (see Kahina), published in 1986, and the final John the Balladeer short story &quot;Where Did She Wander?&quot;.

The agent for his literary estate was his friend, the writer and editor Karl Edward Wagner, who edited the posthumous collections &quot;Valley So Low: Southern Mountain Stories&quot; and &quot;John the Balladeer&quot;. A benefit auction was held for Wellman&#x27;s widow Frances, arranged by Southern fans Beth Gwinn and Sheri Morton, which raised $28,300 in funds. Harlan Ellison was the auctioneer. Included in the auction were such items as a mug owned by both H.P. Lovecraft and Fritz Leiber, a coin from Mel Brooks and the shirt which Ellison wore while writing his story &quot;Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes&quot;.

Frances Wellman died on May 7, 2000. She was cremated and her ashes spread on the lawn of their home at Dogwood Acres in Chapel Hill, NC.

A son, Wade Wellman, died January 25, 2018, in Waukesha, Wisconsin.

==Awards and honors==
Wellman has been nominated for or won the following awards.

==Adaptations==
The Silver John stories were the inspiration for &quot;Who Fears the Devil?&quot;, a 1994 recording by Joe Bethancourt that featured both traditional Appalachian folk songs that Silver John would have known, and Wellman&#x27;s original lyrics that were in many of the Silver John stories, set to the traditional melodies that Wellman used as models.

Additionally, the progressive bluegrass band, The Dixie Bee-Liners, recorded an original song inspired by the Silver John stories titled &quot;Yellow-Haired Girl&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;RIPE.&quot;

<doc id="1006835" wikidata="Q6966590" url="?curid=1006835" title="Nasal voice">
<text>A nasal voice is a type of speaking voice characterized by speech with a &quot;nasal&quot; quality. It can also occur naturally because of genetic variation. 

Nasal speech can be divided into hypo-nasal and hyper-nasal.

==Hyponasal speech==
Hyponasal speech, denasalization or rhinolalia clausa is a lack of appropriate nasal airflow during speech, such as when a person has nasal congestion.

Some causes of hyponasal speech are adenoid hypertrophy, allergic rhinitis, deviated septum, sinusitis, myasthenia gravis and turbinate hypertrophy.

==Hypernasal speech==
Hypernasal speech or hyperrhinolalia or rhinolalia aperta is inappropriate increased airflow through the nose during speech, especially with syllables beginning with plosive and fricative consonants. 

Examples of hypernasal speech include cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency.

<text>TRF (an abbreviation of Tetsuya Rave Factory) is a Japanese pop band. Its members are DJ Koo, Sam, Etsu, Yu-ki and Chiharu.

==History==
The band debuted as &quot;trf&quot; in 1993. From 1994 to 1995, the band released five singles produced by Tetsuya Komuro, each selling over a million copies under the Avex record label. In 1995, their song &quot;Overnight Sensation: Jidai wa Anata ni Yudaneteru&quot; received a Japan Record Award.

The following year, the band changed their name to an all-capital &quot;TRF&quot; with their single &quot;Hey! Ladies &amp; Gentlemen&quot;.

Yu-ki did voice acting for the children&#x27;s animation movie &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Adventure: My Father&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, for which she sang the opening theme song as well. She also performed the opening song to the 2006 Tokusatsu series &quot;Kamen Rider Kabuto&quot; as well as several variants of it.

Chiharu worked on the choreography for J-pop singer Shizuka Kudō, and appeared in a drama as herself.

Sam was married to popstar and protégé of Tetsuya Komuro, Namie Amuro, in 1997, who was three months pregnant with his child at the time, but the couple were divorced in 2002, due to irreconcilable differences. Amuro had full custody of their son, Haruto Maruyama.

The song &quot;Lights and Any More&quot; was used as opening theme of the anime &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot;, and their song &quot;Silence Whispers&quot; was used as the second ending theme for the anime &quot;Black Jack 21&quot;. A remix of their song &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; was used in 2000 as the first season ending theme of the anime &quot;UFO Baby&quot;, and in 2013 it was covered by the group Prizmmy as the opening theme for the series &quot;Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live&quot;.

TRF&#x27;s 20th anniversary was in February 2013. They announced that they would be releasing something new every month, starting from November 2012.

<doc id="1006863" wikidata="Q130667" url="?curid=1006863" title="Gay male speech">
<text>Gay male speech has been the focus of numerous modern stereotypes, as well as sociolinguistic studies, particularly within North American English. Scientific research has uncovered phonetically significant features produced by many gay men and demonstrated that listeners accurately guess speakers&#x27; sexual orientation at rates greater than chance. Historically, gay male speech characteristics have been highly stigmatized, so that such features were often reduced in certain settings, such as the workplace.

Research does not support the notion that gay speech entirely adopts mainstream feminine speech rather, that it selectively adopts some of those features. 

There are similarities between gay male speech and the speech of other members within the LGBTQ+ community. Features of lesbian speech have also been confirmed in the 21st century, though they are far less socially noticed than features of gay male speech. Drag queen speech is a further topic of research and, while some drag queens may also identify as gay men, a description of their speech styles may not be so gender binary (gay versus straight). As with other marginalized communities, speech codes can be deeply tied to local, intimate communities and/or subcultures.

==North American English==
Linguists have attempted to isolate exactly what makes gay men&#x27;s English distinct from that of other demographics since the early 20th century, typically by contrasting it with straight male speech or comparing it to female speech. In older work, speech pathologists often focused on high pitch among men, in its resemblance to women, as a defect. Since the gay community consists of many smaller subcultures, gay male speech does not uniformly fall under a single homogeneous category.

===Gay &quot;lisp&quot;===
What is sometimes colloquially described as a gay &quot;lisp&quot; is one manner of speech associated with some homosexual males who speak English, and perhaps other languages too. It involves a marked pronunciation of sibilant consonants (particularly and ). Speech scientist Benjamin Munson and his colleagues have argued that this is not a mis-articulated (and therefore, not technically a lisp) as much as a hyper-articulated . Specifically, gay men are documented as pronouncing with higher-frequency spectral peaks, an extremely negatively skewed spectrum, and a longer duration than heterosexual men. However, not all gay American men speak with this hyper-articulated (perhaps fewer than half), and some heterosexual men also produce this feature.

===Vowels===
A 2006 study of gay men in the Upper Midwestern American dialect region found that they tend to lower the vowel (except before a nasal consonant) as well as the vowel. This linguistic phenomenon is normally associated with the California vowel shift and also reported in a study of a gay speaker of California English itself, who strengthened these same features and also fronted the and vowels when speaking with friends more than in other speaking situations. The study suggests that a California regional sound can be employed or intensified by gay American men for stylistic effect, including to evoke a &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;partier&quot; persona.

===Other characteristics===
Some other speech features are also stereotyped as markers of gay or bisexual males: carefully enunciated pronunciation, wide pitch range (high and rapidly changing pitch), breathy voice, lengthened fricative sounds, pronunciation of as and as (affrication), etc. Research shows that gay speech characteristics include many of the same characteristics other speakers use when attempting to speak with special carefulness or clarity, including over-articulating and expanding the vowel spaces in the mouth.

===Perception===
In terms of perception, the &quot;gay sound&quot; in North American English is popularly presumed to involve the pronunciation of sibilants (, , ) with noticeable assibilation, sibilation, hissing, or stridency. Frontal, dentalized and negatively skewed articulations of (the aforementioned &quot;gay lisp&quot;) are indeed found to be the most powerful perceptual indicators to a listener of a male speaker&#x27;s sexual orientation, with experiments revealing that such articulations are perceived as &quot;gayer-sounding&quot; and &quot;younger-sounding&quot;. So even if a speaker does not display all of these patterns, the stereotype of gay speech and the coordination of other non-linguistic factors, e.g. dress, mannerisms, can help form the perception of these accents in speech.

Gay speech is also widely stereotyped as resembling women&#x27;s speech. However, on the basis of phonetics, Benjamin Munson and his colleagues&#x27; research has discovered that gay male speech does not simply or categorically imitate female speech.

In one Canadian study, listeners correctly identified gay speakers in 62% of cases. A Stanford University experiment analyzed the acoustics of eight males (four straight and four gay), who were recorded reading passages, through the perception of listener-subjects and tasked these listeners with categorizing speakers by adjectives corresponding to common U.S. stereotypes of gay men. The listeners were generally able to correctly identify the sexual orientation of the speakers, reflecting the stereotypes. However, there were no statistically significant differences the listeners identified, if they existed at all, based on intonation. These findings are representative of other studies as well.

Another study examined the duration of certain sounds (, , and the onset of and ), frequency of stressed vowels, voice-onset time of voiceless aspirated consonants, and the release of word-final stop consonants. The study found some correlation between these speech traits and sexual orientation, but also clarified the study&#x27;s narrow scope on only certain phonetic features.

===Other scholars&#x27; views===

Language and gender scholar Robin Lakoff not only compares gay male with female speech but also claims that gay men deliberately imitate the latter, claiming this to include an increased use of superlatives, inflected intonation, and lisping. Later linguists have re-evaluated Lakoff&#x27;s claims and concluded that these characterizations are not consistent for women, instead reflecting stereotypes that may have social meaning and importance but that do not fully capture actual gendered language use.

Linguist David Crystal correlated the use among men of an &quot;effeminate&quot; or &quot;simpering&quot; voice with a widened range of pitch, glissando effects between stressed syllables, greater use of fall-rise and rise-fall tones, vocal breathiness and huskiness, and occasionally more switching to the falsetto register. Still, research has not confirmed any unique intonation or pitch qualities of gay speech. Some such characteristics have been portrayed as mimicking women&#x27;s speech and judged as derogatory toward or trivializing of women.

==Other languages==
A study of over 300 Flemish Dutch-speaking Belgian participants, men and women, found a &quot;significantly higher prevalence&quot; of a &quot;lisp&quot;-like feature in gay men than in other demographics. Several studies have also examined and confirmed gay speech characteristics in Puerto Rican Spanish and other dialects of Caribbean Spanish. Despite some similarities in &quot;gay-sounding&quot; speech found cross-linguistically, it is important to note that phonetic features that cue listener perception of &quot;gayness&quot; are likely to be language-dependent and language-specific, and a feature that is attributed to &quot;gayness&quot; in one linguistic variety or language may not have the same indexical meaning in a different linguistic variety or language. For example, a study from 2015 comparing &quot;gay-sounding&quot; speech in German and Italian finds slightly different acoustic cues for the languages, as well as different extents of the correlation of &quot;gay-sounding&quot; speech to gender-atypical-sounding speech.

<doc id="1006880" wikidata="Q848056" url="?curid=1006880" title="Battle of the Metaurus">
<text>The Battle of the Metaurus was a pivotal battle in the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage, fought in 207 BC near the Metauro River in Italy. The Carthaginians were led by Hasdrubal Barca, brother of Hannibal, who was to have brought siege equipment and reinforcements for Hannibal. The Roman armies were led by the consuls Marcus Livius, who was later nicknamed the Salinator, and Gaius Claudius Nero.

Claudius Nero had just fought Hannibal in Grumentum, some hundreds of kilometres south of the Metaurus river, and reached Marcus Livius by a forced march that went unnoticed by both Hannibal and Hasdrubal, so that the Carthaginians suddenly found themselves outnumbered. In the battle, the Romans used their numerical superiority to outflank the Carthaginian army and rout them, the Carthaginians losing 15,400 men killed or captured, including Hasdrubal.

The battle confirmed Roman supremacy over Italy. Without Hasdrubal&#x27;s army to support him, Hannibal was compelled to evacuate pro-Carthaginian towns in much of southern Italy in the face of Roman pressure and withdraw to Bruttium, where he would remain for the next four years.

==Background==

Hasdrubal&#x27;s campaign to come to his brother&#x27;s aid in Italy had gone remarkably well up to that point. After adeptly escaping Publius Scipio in Baecula, recruiting mercenary contingents in Celtiberia and making his way into Gaul in the winter of 208, Hasdrubal waited until the spring of 207 to make his way through the Alps and into Northern Italy. Hasdrubal made much faster progress than his brother had during his crossing, partly due to the constructions left behind by Hannibal&#x27;s army a decade earlier, but also due to the removal of the Gallic threat that had plagued Hannibal during that expedition. The Gauls now feared and respected the Carthaginians, and not only was Hasdrubal allowed to pass through the Alps unmolested, his ranks were swelled by many enthusiastic Gauls. Hasdrubal, in the same fashion as his brother, succeeded in bringing his war elephants, raised and trained in Hispania, over the Alps.

Rome was still reeling from the series of devastating defeats by Hannibal ten years earlier, and the Romans were terrified at the prospect of fighting two sons of &quot;the Thunderbolt&quot; (a rough translation of Hamilcar Barca&#x27;s surname) at once. The hastily elected consuls Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius were dispatched to face Hannibal and Hasdrubal respectively. Neither consul engaged his intended target initially. Claudius Nero&#x27;s force of over 40,000 men was too formidable for Hannibal to engage openly, and so the two played an unproductive game of cat and mouse in Bruttium; meanwhile, Marcus Livius, despite the added bulwark of two of the many Roman armies scattered across Italy, yielded cautiously to Hasdrubal, and allowed him to push beyond the Metaurus as far south as the town of Sena, today Senigallia.

==Prelude==
It was not until Hasdrubal sent messengers to Hannibal that decisive measures were finally taken. Hasdrubal wished to meet with his brother in southern Umbria. Hasdrubal&#x27;s messengers were captured, and his plans fell into the hands of the consul Claudius Nero. Recognizing the urgency of the situation and the enormous threat that a merging of the Carthaginian brothers&#x27; armies would present to Rome, Nero decided to circumvent the authority of the Senate, also advising them to organize levies for their own protection. Leaving his camp under the command of his legate Quintus Catius, he then marched quickly to the North with 7,000 selected men, 1,000 of whom were cavalry, in order to join up with Marcus Livius. Horsemen were sent forward along the line of march with orders for country people to prepare supplies for soldiers, who took only weapons from the camp. Nero&#x27;s troops were joined by both young and veteran volunteers during the march.

Claudius Nero quickly reached Marcus Livius, who was camped at Sena along with the praetor Porcius Licinius. Hasdrubal was camped approximately a half-mile to the north. Because Claudius Nero had conveniently arrived at night, his presence was not detected until the next day, when the Romans drew themselves up for battle. Hasdrubal drew his army up as well, but upon closer observation of the forces assembled before him, noticed that Marcus Livius&#x27; army seemed to have grown considerably over the course of the night, and that he had a much larger contingent of cavalry. Hasdrubal remembered hearing a second trumpet in the Roman camp heralding the arrival of an important figure the night before—a sound with which he had become familiar during his entanglements with the Romans in Hispania—and correctly concluded that he was now facing two Roman armies. Fearing defeat, he retreated from the field.

The rest of the day passed without event. When nightfall came, Hasdrubal quietly led his army out of his camp with the intent of retreating into Gaul, where he could safely establish communications with Hannibal. Early on in the march, Hasdrubal&#x27;s guides betrayed him, and left him lost and confused along the banks of the Metaurus, searching futilely for a ford at which to cross.

The night passed with no change in Hasdrubal&#x27;s misfortunes, and the morning found his army disarrayed, deprived of sleep, and trapped against the banks of the Metaurus, with a great many of his Gallic troops drunk. With Roman cavalry fast approaching and the legions under the two consuls not far behind, Hasdrubal reluctantly prepared for battle.

==Opposing forces==
The battle was fought on the banks of the Metaurus River, near Montemaggiore al Metauro. The exact numbers of troops on both sides are not known. The Romans estimated 8,000 Ligurians in Hasdrubal&#x27;s army, making up one-third of his infantry. The data given by the ancient sources are often either insufficient or very contradictory. Appian for instance says that the Carthaginian force numbered 48,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 15 elephants. Livy claims that there were 61,400 slain or captured Carthaginian soldiers at the end of the battle and there were still more who escaped the slaughter.

These figures look inflated, especially given that Polybius estimated only 10,000 Carthaginian and Gallic dead. Modern estimates suggest Hasdrubal&#x27;s army was about 30,000 in strength, and Marcus Livius&#x27; army of roughly equal numbers. The propraetor L. Porcius Licinius commanded two legions—as many men as the consul. This means that Marcus Livius and Porcius Licinius had between them four legions, i.e. 32,000–40,000 men, including their allies. The numbers of the allied contingents could have been less than usual due to the refusal of some of the Roman clients to provide auxiliaries. Porcius&#x27; legions were under-strength. The Roman force was probably further diminished by earlier fighting with Hasdrubal, the evidence of which is the presence of 3,000 prisoners in Hasdrubal&#x27;s camp. Claudius Nero&#x27;s 7,000 troops were joined by perhaps 2,000 volunteers en route, and upon his arrival the Romans had 37,000 men concentrated against Hasdrubal.

Like most Carthaginian armies, Hasdrubal&#x27;s was a mix of many different cultures and ethnicities, including Hispanics, Ligures, Gauls, and a few were of African origin. Hasdrubal&#x27;s right flank was on the River Metaurus and his left flank was inaccessible hilly terrain. He placed his cavalry on his right wing to guard it against the superior Roman cavalry that could outflank him. Contrary to this, Hasdrubal&#x27;s left flank was well guarded by hills to the left and ravines in front. Hasdrubal&#x27;s best troops were his Hispanic veterans, who he put in a deep formation on his right flank. The centre was composed of Ligures, also deployed in deep ranks. Finally, on his left, he placed the tired Gauls on a hilltop, shielded by the deep ravine in front of them. Hasdrubal also had ten elephants, which he put up front. He had introduced an innovation in elephant warfare, equipping their mahouts with hammers and chisels to kill the beasts if they ever turned against their own troops, as it was frequent.

Marcus Livius Salinator deployed the Roman army in front of the Carthaginian force. The Roman left wing was commanded by Marcus Livius, the right wing was under Gaius Claudius Nero, facing the inaccessible Gauls, and the centre was under the command of Porcius Licinius. The Roman cavalry was placed on the left wing, facing the Carthaginian cavalry.

==Battle==

The battle started with the Roman left flank charging the Carthaginian right, followed a little later by the advance of the Roman centre. The outnumbered Carthaginian cavalry tumbled against the Roman cavalry. The Carthaginian right wing and centre held their ground and the war elephants succeeded in breaking the Roman lines and spreading mass confusion.

Claudius Nero, on the Roman right flank, struggled to overcome the terrain that blocked his path to the unwary Gauls on Hasdrubal&#x27;s left. Seeing the futility in wasting further time attempting to reach the inert Gauls, he instead took half of his men in cohorts and led them from behind the battling Roman lines to the extreme Roman left, swinging his troops around and crashing into the Carthaginian right flank with sudden force and intensity. The Carthaginian right wing, composed of Hispanics, could not withstand this two pronged attack of Marcus Livius from the front and Claudius Nero on their flank. They were forced to fall back, taking the Ligures in the Carthaginian centre with them. The elephants were running amok, killing Romans and Carthaginians alike. Hasdrubal fought alongside his men and exhorted them to keep fighting, rallying fleeing soldiers and re-starting the battle wherever he was present.

The Gauls on the Carthaginian left now faced a three pronged attack: Porcius Licinius from the front, Marcus Livius from their right flank, and Claudius Nero from the rear. By now, the Roman cavalry had completely defeated the Carthaginian cavalry and, with the retreat of the Carthaginian left wing, a general retreat of Hasdrubal&#x27;s army started. Six of the elephants were killed by their own drivers to stop their rampages and the remaining four were captured by the Romans.

Hasdrubal, seeing that there was nothing more he could do, and presumably doubtful of his own prospects of escape or simply unwilling to be taken captive, charged into the Roman ranks on his horse along with his remnant Hispanic guards and was killed. He was praised by Polybius and Livy for having done all he could as a general and then meeting a glorious death. Dexter Hoyos believes Hasdrubal&#x27;s death was foolish, as he could have given organisation and leadership to the remnants of the Carthaginian army and posed a lingering threat to Rome in northern Italy. An unknown number of Ligurians and Gauls, possibly 10,000 or so, who either escaped the battle or didn&#x27;t take part at all formed into an organised body but dispersed afterwards for want of a general. At least one Carthaginian officer, Hamilcar, refused to give up after Hasdrubal&#x27;s defeat and organized a Cisalpine Gallic army of 40,000 men against the Romans in 200 BC, causing the Battle of Cremona.
==Aftermath==
Claudius Nero showed no respect for his fallen adversary. He had Hasdrubal&#x27;s head severed from his body, taken south, and thrown into Hannibal&#x27;s camp as a token of his brother&#x27;s defeat.

Lord Byron wrote of the battle:
The significance of the Battle of the Metaurus is recognized amongst historians. It is included in Edward Shepherd Creasy&#x27;s &quot;The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World&quot; (1851), the rationale being that it effectively removed the Carthaginian threat from Rome&#x27;s ascendancy to continental dominion by leaving Hannibal stranded in Italy. Paul K. Davis sees its importance as the &quot;Carthaginian defeat ended the attempt to reinforce Hannibal, dooming his effort in Italy, and Rome was able to establish dominance over Spain.&quot; The Battle of the Metaurus is overshadowed by other battles of the Second Punic War, such as Hannibal&#x27;s great victory at the Battle of Cannae or his ultimate defeat at the Battle of Zama. Nonetheless, the effects of Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius&#x27; victory at the Metaurus have earned it a significant standing amongst historians; not only of the history of Rome, but in that of the entire world.

One of Hasdrubal&#x27;s officers, a certain Hamilcar, stayed behind in Cisalpine Gaul after the defeat and organized a united Gallic army of 40,000 men against Rome in 200 BC, sacking the city of Placentia before being defeated and killed by Rome at the Battle of Cremona. On the other hand, a part of the surviving Hispanic mercenaries continued the journey and eventually reached Hannibal.

===Casualties===
Polybius gave 10,000 killed for Hasdrubal&#x27;s army and an unspecified number of prisoners. Six elephants were killed and four captured. The Romans lost 2,000 killed. Livy estimates 8,000 Roman and allied killed, possibly not contradicting Polybius, with the Carthaginians losing 56,000 killed and 5,400 captured. Livy&#x27;s figure for prisoners is generally accepted by modern historians, but the number of Carthaginian deaths is not taken seriously. Total Carthaginian casualties were probably around 15,400, including 10,000 killed and 5,400 captured. A large number of Carthaginian officers were killed and many of the rest captured.

==In literature==
F. L. Lucas&#x27;s short story &quot;The Fortune of Carthage&quot; (&quot;Athenaeum&quot;, 28 January 1921 ) is about the battle&#x27;s prelude, from Claudius Nero&#x27;s viewpoint. It focuses on the dilemma the Roman consul faced in Apulia on intercepting Hasdrubal&#x27;s letter to Hannibal. The closing section gives Hannibal&#x27;s perspective in the aftermath of the battle. The story was admired by T. E. Lawrence.

<doc id="1006900" wikidata="Q5679402" url="?curid=1006900" title="Russ Columbo">
<text>Ruggiero Eugenio di Rodolfo Colombo (January 14, 1908 – September 2, 1934), known as Russ Columbo, was an American baritone, songwriter, violinist, and actor. He is famous for romantic ballads such as his signature tune &quot;You Call It Madness, But I Call It Love&quot; and his own compositions &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; and &quot;Too Beautiful for Words&quot;.

==Early life==
Columbo was born in Camden, New Jersey, the twelfth child of Italian immigrant parents Nicola and Giulia &quot;Julia&quot; Colombo. He attended Everett Grammar School and started playing the violin at a very young age, debuting professionally at the age of 13. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 16, and he attended Belmont High School there. He left high school at age 17 to study violin under Calmon Luboviski and travel with various bands around the country. He sang and played violin in numerous nightclubs.

==Career==

===Films===
By 1928, at the age of 20, Columbo began to participate in motion pictures, including a Vitaphone short in which Columbo appeared as a member of Gus Arnheim and His Orchestra. Eventually, he obtained some feature work in front of the camera, but he slowed down his activities in cinema to pursue other interests. At the time of his death, Columbo had just completed work on the film &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot;; he was on his way to stardom when his life was cut short. Among Columbo&#x27;s other films are: &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; (with Betty Compton), &quot;Wolf Song&quot; (with Lupe Vélez), &quot;The Texan&quot; (with Gary Cooper), and &quot;Broadway Thru a Keyhole&quot;.

===Musician===
Columbo performed seven vocals while with Arnheim as a member of the string section, six for Okeh Records and only one for Victor (&quot;A Peach of a Pair&quot;) on June 18, 1930, a few months before Bing Crosby joined the band along with Al Rinker and Harry Barris as &quot;The Rhythm Boys&quot;.

Columbo ran a nightclub for a while, the Club Pyramid, but gave it up when his manager told him he had star potential. In 1931, he traveled to New York City with his manager, songwriter Con Conrad, who secured a late-night radio slot with NBC. This led to numerous engagements, a recording contract with RCA Victor records, and tremendous popularity with legions of mostly female fans. Not long after arriving in New York, Columbo met actress Dorothy Dell at an audition for the Ziegfeld Follies and began seeing her. Conrad did his best to break the relationship up with a series of publicity-created &quot;ruse romances&quot; involving Columbo and actresses such as Greta Garbo and Pola Negri; it succeeded. (Dorothy Dell died in an auto accident in June 1934—just months before Columbo&#x27;s own fatal accident.)

The type of singing that was popularized by the likes of Columbo, Rudy Vallee, and Bing Crosby is called crooning. Columbo disliked the label, but it caught on with the general public. It gained popular credence, despite its initial use as a term of derision for the singers employing their low, soothing voices in romantic songs. Similarly, to reinforce his romantic appeal, he was called &quot;Radio&#x27;s Valentino&quot;.

Columbo composed the songs &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; and &quot;You Call It Madness (But I Call It Love)&quot; with Con Conrad, Gladys Du Bois, and Paul Gregory; &quot;Too Beautiful For Words&quot;, recorded by the Teddy Joyce Orchestra in 1935; &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend There&#x27;s a Moon&quot;, recorded by Fats Waller and Tab Hunter; and &quot;Hello Sister&quot;. &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; is a standard that has been recorded by Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Art Tatum, Perry Como, the Ink Spots, Mildred Bailey, Tiny Tim, Teddy Wilson with Lena Horne on vocals, Bing Crosby, Billy Eckstine, and James Brown. Perry Como had a number-one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; with his recording. James Brown had a top-20 pop hit and performed the song on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and in the concert movie &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot; (1964).

==Death==
On Sunday, September 2, 1934, Columbo was shot under peculiar circumstances by a longtime friend, photographer Lansing Brown Jr., while Columbo was visiting him at home. Brown had a collection of firearms, and the two men were examining various pieces. Quoting Brown&#x27;s description of the accident:
I was absent-mindedly fooling around with one of the guns. It was of a dueling design and works with a cap and trigger. I was pulling back the trigger and clicking it time after time. I had a match in my hand and when I clicked, apparently the match caught in between the hammer and the firing pin. There was an explosion. Russ slid to the side of his chair.

The ball ricocheted off a nearby table and hit Columbo above the left eye. Surgeons at Good Samaritan Hospital made an unsuccessful attempt to remove the ball from Columbo&#x27;s brain; he died less than six hours after the shooting. Columbo&#x27;s death was ruled an accident and Brown was exonerated from blame. His funeral Mass was attended by numerous Hollywood actors, including Bing Crosby and Carole Lombard, who was to have had dinner with Columbo the evening of the accident and who was romantically involved with him.

Columbo&#x27;s mother was hospitalized in serious condition from a heart attack at the time of the accident; the news was withheld from her by his brothers and sisters for the remaining 10 years of her life. Owing to her previous heart condition, it was feared that the news would prove fatal to her (she died in 1944). They used all manner of subterfuge to give the impression that Columbo was still alive, including faked letters from him and records used to simulate his radio program.

Columbo is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Actress Virginia Brissac was serving as Columbo&#x27;s private secretary at the time of his death and was later called upon by the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office to testify and identify Columbo&#x27;s remains at the subsequent inquest.

<doc id="1006912" wikidata="Q1365791" url="?curid=1006912" title="Tristram Dalton">
<text>Tristram Dalton (May 28, 1738 – May 30, 1817) was an American politician and merchant from Massachusetts. He served a single term as one of the first United States senators, from 1789 to 1791. He was for many years one of the leading citizens of Newburyport, Massachusetts, but lost most of his fortune due to ill-timed and mismanaged investments in the real estate of Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Tristram Dalton was born in a part of Newbury, Massachusetts, that is now Newburyport, the only child of Michael and Mary (Little) Dalton. He graduated from Harvard College in 1755, in a class that also included John Adams. Afterwards, he studied law and was admitted to the bar, but did not practice, instead pursuing a career as a merchant. Dalton&#x27;s father was a ship&#x27;s captain turned merchant, involved in trade with Europe and the West Indies, and was instrumental in securing the separation of Newburyport from Newbury. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1770, Tristram inherited an estate and local businesses that made him Newburyport&#x27;s wealthiest citizen.

==Political career==
Dalton was not significantly involved in politics until 1774, when the tensions of the American Revolution were rising but the American Revolutionary War had not yet started. He was elected to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and the Newburyport board of selectmen in 1774, and was an active proponent of independence after the war broke out. His contributions included provisioning of ships from his merchant fleet to the Penobscot Expedition of 1780. Dalton served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1782 to 1785, and served as its speaker in 1784. He served as a Massachusetts state senator from 1786 to 1788.

Dalton was elected to the Continental Congress in 1783 and 1784, but did not attend. He was elected as a delegate to the state convention on the adoption of the United States Constitution, in which he advocated for its adoption. In 1788 he was elected as one of the state&#x27;s first United States Senators, along with Caleb Strong. Strong won the draw for the longer of the two terms, leaving Dalton with a short two-year term. He served from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1791. In the 1791 election (US Senators were then chosen by vote of the state legislature), Dalton ran a distant fourth against George Cabot, the eventual victor, and others.

In 1801 he was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as the last commissioner of the Federal City, which by then had been named Washington in the District of Columbia. He filled the seat vacated by William Cranch who was appointed to the bench in the new capitol and served for a little over a year until the Board of Commissioners of the Federal City was disbanded in 1802.

==Later life==
Dalton had married Ruth Hooper, the daughter of a wealthy Marblehead merchant, in 1761. They had grown fond of the city life in New York City (then the seat of the federal government), and moved there, and then Philadelphia. When the site of the nation&#x27;s capital was selected, Dalton sold off most of his property in Massachusetts, and speculatively purchased land in Washington, D.C. Many of the family&#x27;s personal items were lost when the ship carrying them to Washington foundered. Dalton&#x27;s investment was also a failure, as Washington real estate did not appreciate, and he had invested through an unscrupulous agent, wiping out most of his fortune.

In order to make ends meet, Dalton was given a patronage appointment as surveyor of the port of Boston, serving from November 1814 until his death on May 30, 1817. He is interred in the churchyard of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Newburyport. His wife died in 1826. Of their ten children, only three girls survived to adulthood.

==Slave ownership==
According to research conducted by The Washington Post, Dalton was one of only two member of Congress from Massachusetts who owned slaves. In 1804, Dalton buried his slave, named Fortune, in the all white consecrated Old Burying Hill Cemetery by the Bartlet Mall in Newburport.

==Honors and legacy==
Dalton was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, founded in 1780.

Tristram Dalton is the namesake of Dalton, Massachusetts, Dalton, New Hampshire and Dalton, Georgia.

<text>Labotsibeni Mdluli (c. 1859 – 15 December 1925), also known as Gwamile, was the queen mother and queen regent of Swaziland.

==Early life==

She was born at Luhlekweni in northern Swaziland around 1859, the daughter of Matsanjana Mdluli. At the time of her birth, her father was away fighting the people of Tsibeni in what became the Barberton district of the Transvaal — hence her name. This conflict, in which her father was embroiled at the time of her birth, was part of King Mswati II’s ongoing efforts to solidify his rule and consolidate the boundaries of his kingdom. Notably, the Mdluli clan, to which she belonged, was among the high-ranking members of the Swati aristocracy. This distinguished lineage would later become significant in determining the succession to the throne when one of her sons emerged victorious. 
Her father passed away circa 1870, and she came under the guardianship of her uncle, the Chief, also known as her &#x27;babe mncane&#x27; in Swati culture. Chief Mvelase, who also resided at the royal court of Ludzidzini which is situated at the Ezulwini Valley central Swaziland, brought her with him. At court, she was known as &#x27;LaMvelasi&#x27;, a Swati custom of addressing women by their maiden or father’s name, even after marriage. Uniquely, she was named after her influential adoptive father or uncle, further enhancing her status. 

Historian Hilda Kuper notes that growing up in the royal palace afforded her the advantage of acquiring “knowledge of court etiquette, insights into the political dynamics of the era, and a sense of self-assurance”. These experiences would later contribute to her distinguished leadership.
She served as an attendant to the old queen mother, Tsandzile (&#x27;LaZidze&#x27;), the widow of King Sobhuza I and mother of Mswati II. Tsandzile was a formidable figure in her own right, credited with significant contributions to the formation of the Swati Nation. 
==Marriage==
She became one of the wives of the young Ingwenyama or king of the Swazi, Mbandzeni Dlamini (c. 1857–1889), soon after his succession in 1874. They had four surviving children, three sons, Bhunu (c. 1875–1899), Malunge (c. 1880–1915), and Lomvazi (c. 1885–1922), and a daughter, Tongotongo (c. 1879–1918).

Labotsibeni&#x27;s husband, King Mbandzeni (also known as Dlamini IV) was described as an attractive person, and an essentially fair-minded ruler, who was unable to stop, and may indeed have encouraged, the army of concession-hunters who invaded his country in the wake of the gold rush to Barberton in the late 1880s. By the time of his death in October 1889 he had granted numerous overlapping and conflicting land concessions, and a variety of equally contentious monopolies, including one which purported to give its holder the right to collect ‘the king&#x27;s private revenue’. Critics alleged that many of these were granted in exchange for greyhounds and gin, but a good deal of money changed hands, much of it finding its way into the pockets of corrupt white advisers, including the egregious and venal Theophilus ‘Offy’ Shepstone, the eldest son of Sir Theophilus Shepstone. 

These concessions were to be the subject of endless litigation and several commissions of inquiry over the ensuing twenty years. They had the effect of involving the governments of Great Britain and the South African Republic (the Transvaal) in the affairs of Swaziland in support of the competing claims of their citizens. The complex and long-running nature of the litigation that they engendered played a part in ensuring that Swaziland avoided complete incorporation into the South African Republic before 1899, the British colony of the Transvaal after 1902, or the Union of South Africa in 1910.

==Early regency==

After the selection of her eldest son, Bhunu, as the successor to his father in 1889, Labotsibeni became the Ndlovukati or Queen mother. There is little doubt that in choosing Bhunu as the heir to his father the old queen mother, Tibati, and the members of the inner council were influenced by their knowledge of his mother&#x27;s strength of character. It is said that King Mbandzeni had himself recommended her to be the mother of his heir. In the early years of Bhunu&#x27;s minority Labotsibeni had to take second place to Tibati, who served as queen regent. While Tibati remained at the royal homestead of Nkanini, Labotsibeni established a new headquarters for her son a few kilometres away at Zombodze. There was some tension between the two rulers, which lasted until Tibati&#x27;s death in October 1895, but by 1894 Labotsibeni had emerged as the stronger of the two. She played a leading role in opposition to the third Swaziland convention of 1894, which provided for the establishment, in February 1895, of a Transvaal protectorate over Swaziland. This replaced the tripartite system of administration involving Great Britain, the Transvaal, and the Swazi nation, that had been set up in 1890. It also represented a concession by the British to the claims of the Transvaal over Swaziland, though they were not prepared to allow Swaziland&#x27;s incorporation into the Transvaal. It was at this time that Labotsibeni emerged as a remarkably intelligent, articulate, and astute spokesperson for the Swazi nation; she dominated the debate at indabas, and got the better of the argument at meetings with such representatives of the Transvaal as the vice-president, N. J. Smit, and the commandant-general, Piet Joubert, as well as with the republic&#x27;s special commissioner in Swaziland, J. C. Krogh, and successive British consuls in Swaziland, James Stuart and Johannes Smuts.

Although Bhunu had been installed as ngwenyama or king, with the title Ngwane V, in February 1895, Labotsibeni retained considerable authority. As queen mother she was, in terms of the unwritten constitution of the country, a dual monarch with political influence equal to that of the king, and with the supernatural power to make rain. Her position was strengthened by the reckless behaviour of Bhunu, who established his own base at Mampondweni in the Mdzimba mountains above Zombodze. When he was implicated in the murder of Labotsibeni&#x27;s senior induna, Mbhabha Nsibandze, and two other indunas, at Zombodze in April 1898, the Transvaal administration sought to bring him to trial. Accompanied by his brother, Malunge, he fled across the border into the British colony of Natal. He was saved from deposition by the intervention of the British high commissioner in South Africa, Lord Milner, who held that the Transvaal&#x27;s attempt to try him was ultra vires. He returned to Swaziland under British protection and a commission of inquiry imposed a fine on him, holding that he had allowed disorderly behaviour within his kingdom. Britain and the Transvaal then combined to add a protocol to the Swaziland convention that purported to reduce his status from king to paramount chief, and removed his powers of criminal jurisdiction.

On the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899 the Transvaal&#x27;s special commissioner, J. C. Krogh, and the British consul, Johannes Smuts, withdrew from Swaziland. General Piet Joubert wrote to Bhunu, indicating that the South African Republic was leaving Swaziland in his hands. He resumed full authority over his kingdom, but he did not live long to enjoy untrammelled power: he died two months later at Zombodze on 10 December. Labotsibeni now became queen regent as well as queen mother and acted in the name of Bhunu&#x27;s son, Mona, also known as Nkhotfotjeni, who was chosen to succeed at the age of six months; he eventually became paramount chief, and later King Sobhuza II. It was widely believed that Labotsibeni would have preferred her second son, Malunge, a handsome, intelligent, eloquent, and able young man, to succeed Bhunu. His succession would have avoided a very long minority, but it would have been an unacceptable break with Swazi custom.

For most of the three-year crisis of the South African War, Labotsibeni was, with the support of a co-regent, Prince Logcogco (a son of King Mswati II), and her council, the last independent ruler in Africa south of the Zambezi. During this period she adopted the habitual stance of a Swazi monarch. While leaning towards the British, she sought to preserve Swaziland as a neutral space and maintained a diplomatic relationship with the South African Republic&#x27;s forces. She was largely successful in keeping Swaziland out of the war. Exceptional incidents were Thinthitha Dlamini&#x27;s attack on a party from the Piet Retief commando near Hlatikhulu in February 1901, and General Tobias Smuts&#x27;s attack on a small unit of the British irregular force Steinacker&#x27;s Horse at Bremersdorp in July 1901. Labotsibeni had apparently called in the Boers to remove this troublesome group of freebooters and to release Prince Mancibane, a member of the royal family whom the British had detained on suspicion of spying, but she regretted the Boers&#x27; destruction of the small town.

As the war came to an end, Labotsibeni and the Swazi council hoped for the establishment of a British protectorate. They were disappointed by Lord Milner&#x27;s initial decision that Swaziland should be administered through the Transvaal. Labotsibeni and her council protested strongly against the terms of the Swaziland order in council of 1903 and the Swaziland administration proclamation of 1904, which set up the machinery of government under a resident commissioner. Prince Malunge led a Swazi deputation to meet Milner&#x27;s successor as high commissioner, Lord Selborne, in Pretoria in 1905, to protest over these and other issues, and Selborne himself paid a visit to Swaziland in September 1906. On that occasion he announced that the administration of Swaziland would, in view of the imminent restoration of self-government to the Transvaal, be transferred to the high commissioner. As a result of Labotsibeni&#x27;s pressure, the threat posed by the recent Zulu uprising, and the still unresolved issue of the land concessions, Swaziland thus became a high commission territory like Bechuanaland and Basutoland, though it was never formally declared to be a British protectorate.

==Regency under Britain==

Labotsibeni and her council also protested vigorously against the terms of the land partition, which was proclaimed in 1907, and subsequently carried out by George Grey, brother of the Liberal cabinet minister Sir Edward Grey. This divided Swaziland between the Swazi nation, the white concessionaires, and the British crown. Robert Coryndon, who was brought in from north-western Rhodesia as resident commissioner in that year, sought to take a hard line with Labotsibeni, Malunge, and those whom he described as ‘the Zombodze faction’. He was not, however, able to get support from his superiors for a plan to depose Labotsibeni and replace her by Mona, the infant heir. After a year in office Coryndon described Labotsibeni as ‘a woman of extraordinary diplomatic ability and strength of character, an experienced and capable opposition with which it [the administration] was for some time incapable of dealing’ (Jones, 402). Prince Malunge was the effective leader of a Swazi deputation to London, which met the colonial secretary, Lord Elgin, in February 1908. They got little or no redress on the land issue, apart from a disputed, and subsequently dishonoured, promise that they would be able to buy back the crown land. Three years after the return of the deputation, Labotsibeni and Malunge became, with the consent of Coryndon, the prime movers behind a national fund to buy back land—a move that seems to have drawn a little of the bitterness from the issue.

The establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910, and the provision in the schedule attached to the act for the future incorporation of Swaziland and the other high commission territories in the union, prompted Labotsibeni and Malunge to take a greater interest than they had done previously in the affairs of South Africa, where they had many subjects. Labotsibeni was reported in 1914 as saying that ‘as Swaziland would no doubt enter the Union at some future date she was in sympathy with any efforts tending towards the betterment of the conditions under which Union natives live, and for this reason her son Malunge had become a member of the Native Congress’ (Macmillan, 294–5). Prince Malunge attended the conference that was held by the South African Natives National Congress in Kimberley in February 1914 to discuss the response to the Land Act, and was treated as the most distinguished delegate. He and Labotsibeni were close to two of the prime movers in the founding of the congress, the lawyers Pixley Seme and Richard Msimang, and provided the bulk of the funds, about £3000, which were required for the establishment in 1912 of its official newspaper, Abantu-Batho, whose first editor, Cleopas Kunene, had been secretary and interpreter to Labotsibeni. Malunge&#x27;s sudden death in January 1915 was a great blow to his mother and the Swazi nation, and was seen as a loss to the black people of South Africa as a whole.

Labotsibeni&#x27;s last major contribution as queen regent was her insistence, in spite of some opposition, that Mona, the heir to the throne, should receive the best education then available to a black person in southern Africa. After primary education at the Swazi National School at Zombodze he was sent in 1916 to Lovedale, a school run by the United Free Church of Scotland at Alice in the Cape, which he attended for three years. In 1919 she decided that he should be withdrawn from school and prepared for his installation as king. She transferred authority to him in the presence of the resident commissioner, de Symons Montagu Honey, at a ceremony on 22 December 1921. In a moving address, which was read and translated on her behalf by her secretary, Josiah Vilakazi, she said:

==Later life==

Labotsibeni died after a long illness at Zombodze on 15 December 1925 and was buried there. In an obituary The Times noted that she had for two generations been ‘the best known native woman in South Africa’. T. D. Mweli Skota&#x27;s African Yearly Register noted that ‘she was a wonderful woman; a good, wise and tactful ruler, and acknowledged by all the representatives of the British Throne as one of the cleverest rulers in Africa’ (Skota, 77).

<text>Saul Chaplin (February 19, 1912 – November 15, 1997) was an American composer and musical director.

He was born Saul Kaplan in Brooklyn, New York.
He had worked on stage, screen and television since the days of Tin Pan Alley. In film, he won three Oscars for collaborating on the scores and orchestrations of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954) and &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961).

==Biography==

Born to a Jewish family, Chaplin graduated with a B.A. in accounting from New York University&#x27;s School of Commerce. After school, Chaplin joined the ASCAP and started out penning tunes for the theatre, vaudeville and for New York&#x27;s famous songwriting district, Tin Pan Alley. While in New York, Chaplin teamed with Sammy Cahn to compose original songs for Vitaphone movie shorts, filmed in Brooklyn by Warner Brothers. During this period the team was sometimes billed only by surname (&quot;Cahn and Chaplin&quot;), in the manner of Rodgers and Hart or Gilbert and Sullivan.

Cahn and Chaplin relocated to Hollywood and scored two films for Universal Pictures. Chaplin then moved to Columbia Pictures to score &quot;Cover Girl&quot; and &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;. While on the latter film, Chaplin and Al Jolson penned the million-selling hit tune &quot;The Anniversary Song&quot;. In the late 1940s, Chaplin moved to MGM to work on a long string of films including &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (1953), &quot;High Society&quot; (1956) and &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (1958). For collaborating on such hits as &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen&quot; and &quot;Please Be Kind&quot;, Chaplin was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985. He won Academy Awards for his work on the scores of &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; as well as nominations for &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; and &quot;High Society&quot;.

While continuing as a film music supervisor, Chaplin became an associate producer in the early &#x27;60s and worked on such major features as &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1960), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot; (1963), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), &quot;STAR!&quot; (1968), &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972) and &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part 2&quot; (1976).

He published his autobiography, &quot;The Golden Age of Movie Musicals and Me&quot;, in 1994. He had worked with and was friends with most of the major songwriters and performers of his era, such as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Al Jolson, Leonard Bernstein, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Julie Andrews, Frank Sinatra and others. His memoir focused on the behind the scenes aspect of moviemaking.

==Marriages==
Chaplin married Ethel Schwartz and had one child, a daughter Judith (who married Harold Prince); the couple divorced in 1950. In 1968, Chaplin married Betty Levin, who had worked as script supervisor on &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

==Death==
In late 1997, the 85-year-old Chaplin suffered a bad fall and on November 15 died in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center as a result of his injuries.

<text>Simply Irresistible is a 1999 American romantic comedy film directed by Mark Tarlov and was written by Judith Roberts, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flanery. It is Regency Enterprises&#x27; first film to be released by 20th Century Fox, instead of Warner Bros. Pictures.

==Plot==
Amanda Shelton inherits her late mother&#x27;s restaurant, but lacks the ability to cook. The restaurant is failing when Amanda meets a mysterious and possibly magical man at the local market. He introduces himself as Gene O&#x27;Reilly and claims to be an old friend of her mother&#x27;s. He sells her crabs, one of which escapes cooking to become her personal mascot. While chasing the crab, Amanda meets Tom Bartlett, a department store manager at Henri Bendel on Fifth Avenue, who is opening an ambitious new restaurant inside his store. Though they are clearly attracted to each other, Tom is involved with a clingy but beautiful woman named Chris.

Later that day, Tom and Chris are on their way to lunch, where Tom plans to break up with Chris, but the cab driver drops them at the wrong location— Amanda&#x27;s restaurant, the Southern Cross. Tom sees Amanda outside, and decides they should have lunch there instead.

For unclear reasons, Amanda begins cooking her feelings into her food, and she miraculously becomes an impressive, creative chef. Chris, driven by Amanda&#x27;s negative feelings toward her cooked into her own food, breaks up with Tom and begins smashing plates in the restaurant. Tom, however, is unbothered as he is more focused on how delicious his crab dish is, with Amanda aspiring to make a truly amazing dish.

Amanda visits Tom at Henri Bendel so that he can replace the plates that Chris broke. When he eats éclairs that Amanda baked her passion for Tom into and he feeds her one, they end up in a trance together. He shows her the space where the new restaurant will be, where they have a shared fantasy wherein they dance flirtatiously, and they begin a romance.

Meanwhile, after Tom&#x27;s assistant Lois steals an éclair from Tom that Tom himself had stolen from one of Amanda&#x27;s patrons and is enamored by how delicious it is, she buys as many éclairs from Amanda&#x27;s restaurant as she can so she can seduce Jonathan Bendel, the owner of Henri Bendel.

As a result of her food improving overnight, the Southern Cross becomes increasingly successful. One night, Tom visits Amanda after the restaurant has closed and after tasting a dish of hers, they begin to kiss and start floating. Tom panics and breaks things off with Amanda, believing she is some kind of witch who is manipulating his feelings with magic.

When Amanda goes to confront Tom one last time at his office, she witnesses the violent tantrum and resignation of a celebrity French chef hired for Tom&#x27;s new restaurant. When Jonathan realizes that Amanda cooked the eclairs Lois had fed him, he demands that Tom hire her for the opening, despite his protests.

On opening night, Amanda is initially shunned by the snobbish French staff and that, coupled with her continued heartbreak over Tom, causes her to unknowingly cook her sorrow into one of the first courses, causing the entire restaurant to sob uncontrollably. She eventually overcomes her self-doubt and reaches her full potential as a chef, and the opening is a complete success.

Stunned but enchanted by the remarkable effect Amanda&#x27;s food has had on the guests, Tom goes after Amanda as she&#x27;s leaving the opening. He convinces her to come back and admits his love for her, and the two reconcile on the dance floor, not noticing Gene is gleefully conducting the orchestra behind them, implying the magic that sparked in Amanda came from him.

==Production==

According to Mark Tarlov, the director, the conception of the film arose from &quot;intersection of eating and drinking and romance [...] part of my interest with the movie was this idea of being able to bend reality. How food and wine actually bends time and space [...] the whole Einsteinian view of bending time and space based on your position relative to the events that are happening.&quot;

Tarlov&#x27;s wife, Judith Roberts, wrote the screenplay based on a story co-developed by Roberts and Tarlov. According to Tarlov, &quot;the script was about a middle-aged young woman [...] who had never found romance before because she never found her passion. And when she found her passion—which was cooking—romance followed.&quot;

Tarlov pitched the film to Holly Hunter, who he intended to play the lead role, but the studio did not want her to play the part. Sarah Jessica Parker was then wanted, but the studio felt she was too young for the part. The character was then rewritten to a 20 year old woman with Sarah Michelle Gellar landing the role. The studio wanted to cash in on her success from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; was poorly received by critics. Though the acting has received praise, the screenplay has received criticism. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 16%, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 3.95/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; is simply not.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 27 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B−.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, and stated &quot;Old-fashioned and obvious, yes, like a featherweight comedy from the 1950s. But that&#x27;s the charm&quot;. John Petrakis from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a negative review: &quot;Falls prey to the all-too-contemporary problem of complicating the tale until the ending is not only obvious, but prayed for between yawns&quot;. Tom Meek from &quot;Film Threat&quot; described the film as &quot;Insipid, maudlin mush&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened at #9 at the North American box office making $2.2 million USD in its opening weekend.

==Astaire references==
The film contains references to four musical films of Fred Astaire:

* &quot;The Belle of New York&quot; (1952): Flanery and Gellar&#x27;s floating to the ceiling evokes similar scenes involving Astaire and Vera-Ellen.
* &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; (1945)
** The flooring which Flanery selects for his new restaurant is a copy of that used in the &quot;Coffee Time&quot; number. 
** Dylan Baker comments: &quot;This looks like something out of an MGM musical&quot;.
* &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937): Flanery&#x27;s confusion when faced with multiple images of Gellar echoes Astaire when confronted with multiple masked versions of Ginger Rogers in the &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; finale.
* &quot; Swing Time&quot; (1936): The layout of the restaurant at the end of the movie closely resembles the restaurant and night club, the &quot;Silver Sandal.&quot;

<doc id="1007003" wikidata="Q5344786" url="?curid=1007003" title="Edward Pawley">
<text>Edward Joel Pawley (March 16, 1901 – January 27, 1988) was an American actor of radio, films and Broadway. The full name on his birth certificate is Edward Joel Stone Pawley; he never used the Stone name, which derived from a Stone family in Illinois.

== Early years ==
At maturity, Pawley was 5&#x27;10&quot; tall with thick black hair and blue eyes. While in high school, he became interested in both journalism and acting. Acting won out after taking drama classes and appearing in high school plays. He moved to New York City in 1920 to pursue a career in the theater.

==Broadway==
Pawley began his theatrical career in 1920 and reached the Broadway stage in 1923 in &quot;The Shame Woman&quot;. He went on to star in various well-known Broadway plays, including &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1928), &quot;Processional&quot; (1928), &quot;Subway Express&quot; (1929), &quot;Two Seconds&quot; (1931), &quot;Life Begins&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Willow and I&quot; (1942). Pawley&#x27;s rich, baritone voice was hailed by leading journalists of the day, including Walter Winchell and Heywood Hale Broun. Although he was probably best known in the theater for his portrayal of Elmer Gantry in the Broadway play of the same name, it was his portrayal of John Allen in &quot;Two Seconds&quot; that brought him to the attention of Hollywood by way of Warner Brothers. Winchell wrote that Pawley received a standing ovation after his opening night performance in the 1931 play &quot;Two Seconds&quot;.

==Hollywood==
Not long after sound film came into vogue, Pawley left the theater in 1932 and went to Hollywood where he performed in over 50 movies during a relatively brief (for Hollywood) ten-year span. He had feature roles in such movies as &quot;The Hoosier Schoolboy&quot; with Mickey Rooney, &quot;G Men&quot; with James Cagney, &quot;The Oklahoma Kid&quot; with Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, &quot;King Solomon of Broadway&quot; with Edmund Lowe and Louise Henry, &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot; with George Raft and Cagney, &quot;Tom Sawyer, Detective&quot; with Janet Waldo and Donald O&#x27;Connor and &quot;Romance on the Range&quot; with Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes. He played mostly &quot;bad guy&quot; roles in gangster, horror, comedy and Western films. He became friends with Cagney (with whom he made five movies), Jackie Cooper (four movies) and Francis Lederer. One of his earliest friends in the entertainment industry was Arthur Hughes, who played Bill Davidson on the long-running radio show &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot;. Hughes also acted in some Broadway plays and was Pawley&#x27;s best man at his wedding in 1922 to stage actress Martina May Martin.

==Radio==
Pawley became disenchanted with Hollywood during the attempted infiltration by the communists in the late 1930s and early 1940s and left in 1942. He returned briefly to Broadway, where he starred with Gregory Peck in what was Peck&#x27;s second Broadway play titled &quot;The Willow and I&quot;. In the 1930s, Pawley had performed leading romantic roles on &quot;The Collier Hour&quot; radio program. He resumed work in radio after returning to New York City. He played opposite Lucille Wall in the radio soap opera &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot; as &quot;Love Story Boy and Girl.&quot; Later in 1943, Pawley played Steve Wilson on the radio drama series &quot;Big Town&quot;, replacing Edward G. Robinson, who had played the role from 1937–42 when the show was produced in Hollywood. Wilson&#x27;s sidekick on &quot;Big Town&quot; was &quot;girl reporter&quot; Lorelei Kilbourne, played by Fran Carlon. Pawley had performed with Robinson in 1926 in a comedy play titled &quot;The Stolen Lady&quot; at &quot;Werba&#x27;s Brooklyn Theater&quot;.

During Pawley&#x27;s eight-year reign, &quot;Big Town&quot; achieved the number one rating for reporter-type radio drama shows. In the January 1948 Nielson ratings, the show was ranked #12 among all radio programs, ahead of such popular shows as &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Sam Spade&quot;, &quot;Mr. District Attorney&quot;, &quot;The FBI in Peace and War&quot;, &quot;Blondie&quot; and &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot;. It also was in the Top 10 of all radio shows more times than any other that year except for The Bob Hope Show and Fibber McGee and Molly. His audience was estimated at anywhere from 10 to 20 million radio listeners.

==Retirement==
Pawley left &quot;Big Town&quot; in 1951 and retired near the small village of Amissville in rural Rappahannock County, Virginia. He had fallen in love with the state while touring with the 1920 play &quot;East Is West&quot;, his first professional acting role. Pawley would become the quintessential &quot;Virginia gentleman&quot; and was loved for his integrity, patriotism and charm. He was admired for his vocabulary and speaking voice, as well as his status as an entertainer in three different media forms (theater, film, and radio). He raised and sold championship goats, wrote poetry and was a part-time announcer at local radio station WCVA in Culpeper, Virginia. At WCVA, he replaced (Robert Gibson Corder, Ph.D.), who would later write Pawley&#x27;s biography. Pawley became a member of The Lambs (the actor&#x27;s club) in 1951.

Pawley moved to Rock Mills, Virginia, in the mid-1950s and lived on the original site of the Rock Mill near the confluence of the Thornton and Rush rivers, fulfilling a dream of living close to nature. In addition to a goat farm, he and his wife maintained an organic vegetable farm and produced pesticide-free vegetables, goat milk and cheese. They ran a grocery store, the &quot;Cash and Totem Store&quot;, where they sold some of their own produce and his wife sold her &quot;Virginia Honey Girl&quot; line of fruits preserved in honey.

Pawley and his wife were proponents of &quot;back-to-the-earth living with nature&quot; before it became popular. 

Pawley died on January 27, 1988, of a heart condition at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. He and his second wife had no children, but in his will named Jane, Ross, Kathyrn, Juia, Richard and Robin Rottier as his spiritual children. Both he and his wife, who died in 1984, were cremated and their ashes scattered at their favorite spot, &quot;Roaring Rock&quot;, alongside the Rush River, which partially flows through their former estate in Rock Mills. A raised bronze plaque at that site is a memorial to their lives and careers in the entertainment medium.

Pawley had two younger brothers who were also actors, William M. &quot;Bud&quot; Pawley and J. Anthony Pawley. Both acted in Broadway plays and in films, though neither achieved the success and acclaim of their older brother.

== Personal life ==
In 1922, Pawley married his high school sweetheart, Martina May Martin, a professional stage actress. They had one child, Martin Herbert Pawley. They divorced, only to remarry and divorce again. In 1937, Pawley married the then-popular Broadway singer, dancer and actress Helen Shipman. They remained married for 47 years until her death on April 13, 1984.
