<text>William Xavier Kienzle (September 11, 1928 – December 28, 2000) was an American priest and later writer.

==Early career==
Kienzle was born in Detroit, Michigan. Ordained to the priesthood of the Catholic Church in 1954, William X. Kienzle spent twenty years as a parish priest. From 1962-74 he was editor-in-chief of the archdiocese&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Michigan Catholic&quot;, earning an award from Michigan&#x27;s Knights of Columbus for general excellence in journalism and a Catholic Press Association acknowledgment for editorial writing. Kienzle left the priesthood in 1974.

==Career after leaving the priesthood==
When in 1974, Father William X. Kienzle left the priesthood, through a process called laicization and reportedly due to the church&#x27;s refusal to remarry divorcees, he became the editor-in-chief at &quot; MPLS Magazine&quot; in Minneapolis. Later, moving to Texas, Kienzle was Director of the Center for Contemplative Studies at the University of Dallas. During this period Kienzle authored 24 crime fiction/mystery novels featuring Father Robert Koesler, a Catholic priest.

In 1978, Kienzle published the first, and best known of the Father Robert Koesler mystery novels &quot;The Rosary Murders&quot; which was made into a movie in 1987, starring Donald Sutherland as Father Koesler. The screenplay was co-written by Kienzle with Elmore Leonard and Fred Walton, who also directed the film. &quot;The Rosary Murders&quot;, like most of Kienzle&#x27;s mysteries, is set in Detroit, Michigan.

The Cognac Festival du Film Policier in 1988 presented the Audience Award to Director Fred Walton, and a Special Mention Award to Elmore Leonard and Fred Walton for the screenplay and the Dialogs in the 1987 film. In 1980 William X. Kienzle was a National Award Fiction Finalist for &quot;The Rosary Murders&quot;.

==Personal life==
After leaving the priesthood, Kienzle married Javan Herman Andrews, a journalist from the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. Kienzle died suddenly from a heart attack at age 73 on December 28, 2000, at home in West Bloomfield, Michigan, while preparing for an appointment with his cardiologist. Javan Kienzle died from metastatic breast cancer on September 30, 2015.

<doc id="1000579" wikidata="Q198946" url="?curid=1000579" title="En no Gyōja">
<text>(b. 634, in Katsuragi (modern Nara Prefecture); d. c. 700–707) was a Japanese ascetic and mystic, traditionally held to be the founder of Shugendō, the path of ascetic training practiced by the &quot;gyōja&quot; or &quot;yamabushi&quot;.

He was banished by the Imperial Court to Izu Ōshima on June 26, 699, but folk tales at least as old as the &quot;Nihon Ryōiki&quot; (c. 800) recount his supernatural powers and exploits.

He is also referred to by the name , , or also under the full name En no Kimi Ozunu, where is his kabane or titular name.

==Historical references==
Even historical accounts of his life are intermixed with legends and folklore. According to the chronicle &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (797 AD), En no Ozunu was banished to the island of Izu Ōshima on June 26, 699:

On &quot;hinoto-ushi&quot; (sexagenary &quot;fire ox&quot;) day [24th day of the 5th month, Mommu 3 (June 26, 699 AD)], En no Kimi Ozunu was banished to Izu no Shima. Ozunu had first lived in Mount Katsuragi and been acclaimed for his sorcery and was the teacher of Outer Junior 5th Rank Lower Grade . Later, [a person (or Hirotari?)] envied his power and accused him of trickery with his weird magic. [The Imperial Court] banished him far [from the Capital]. Rumor says, &quot;Ozunu was able to manipulate demonic spirits, making them draw water and gather firewood. When they disobeyed, he bound them using sorcery.&quot;

In spite of this incident, it seems that the Court continued to highly evaluate the herbal knowledge of Ozunu&#x27;s school, since Vol. 11 of the book also tells that on October 5, Tenpyō 4 (October 28, 732 AD), his student Karakuni no Hirotari was elected as the , the highest position in .

==In the religion Shugendō==
In folk religion, En no Ozunu is traditionally held to be the founder of Shugendō, a syncretic religion incorporating aspects of Taoism, Shinto, esoteric Buddhism (especially &quot;Shingon Mikkyō&quot; and the Tendai sect) and traditional Japanese shamanism.

En no Gyōja was conferred the posthumous title Jinben Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva Jinben, 神変大菩薩) at a ceremony held in 1799 to commemorate the one-thousandth year of his passing. Authorship of the non-canonical Sutra on the Unlimited Life of the Threefold Body is attributed to En no Gyōja. Due to his mythical status as a mountain saint, he was believed to possess many supernatural powers.

==In popular culture==

* In Kyoto&#x27;s Gion Festival, one of the yamaboko floats (En no Gyoja Yama) is dedicated to En no Gyoja. It is an annual pilgrimage destination for yamabushi (practitioners of Shugendo), who perform various rituals on site. 
* In the 19th century novel &quot;Nansou Satomi Hakkenden&quot;, the spirit of En no Gyoja gifts the Satomi family a magical japamala as a ward against their curse, which is later divided to become the personal talismans of the eponymous Eight Dog Warriors.
* In the historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; by Hiroshi Aramata the protagonist Yasunori Kato claims to be a descendant of En no Gyōja. 
*In the manga &quot;OZN&quot; by Shiro Ohno the protagonist is a superheroic version of En no Ozunu. 
*In the SNES game &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, an NPC named En-no-ozuno resides in Kongokai.
*In the PS1 game Oni Zero: Fukkatsu, the main antagonist is En no Gyōja.
*In Koji Suzuki&#x27;s novel &quot;Ring,&quot; Sadako&#x27;s mother drags a statuette of En no Ozunu from the sea.
*In the movie &quot;Ninja Assassin,&quot; the antagonist is &#x27;Master Ozunu;&#x27; who heads the, &quot;9 Clan&quot;.
*In the anime Zenki, a posthumous character named Enno Ozunu was the master of Zenki, who would centuries later be summoned again by his descendant, Chiaki Enno.
*The manga Touge Oni tells the tale of En no Ozuno and his two disciples, Zenki and Miyo (later Goki), traveling the land of Wa meeting various Kami.

<doc id="1000595" wikidata="Q5033522" url="?curid=1000595" title="Cantabrigian">
<text>Cantabrigian (often shortened to Cantab) is an adjective that is used in two meanings: 1) to refer to what is of or pertaining to the University of Cambridge, located in Cambridge, United Kingdom; or 2) to refer to what is of or pertaining to the cities of Cambridge, England, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The term is derived from &quot;Cantabrigia&quot;, a medieval Latin name for Cambridge invented on the basis of the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Cantebrigge&quot;.

In Cambridge, United States, the name &quot;Cantabrigia&quot; appears in the city seal and (abbreviated to &quot;Cantab&quot;) in the seal of the Episcopal Divinity School, located therein. The word Cantabrigia appears in the circular logo of the Cambridge Trust Company, a financial institution based in Cambridge, United States. A pub in Cambridge, United States, called the Cantab Lounge is a play on this abbreviation.

It is also the name of one of the Rugby clubs based in Cambridge, United Kingdom. &quot;Cantabrigian Rugby Club&quot; formerly The Old Cantabrigian RUFC, was established by the &#x27;old boys&#x27; of local Hills Road Sixth Form College (formerly The Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, until 1974). Cantabrigian Rowing Club was similarly established, in 1950.

<doc id="1000608" wikidata="Q5211091" url="?curid=1000608" title="Dalla">
<text>Dalla was a band specialising in traditional Cornish music who were active from the late 1990s until about 2017. They were known mainly for their festival and concert performances, but until about 2013 also played music for Cornish Nos Lowen dance nights. After this, they used the name &#x27;Skillywidden&#x27; when playing as a dance band. Skillywidden continues to be one of the main Nos Lowen dance bands.

Members play the clarinet, bouzouki, fiddle, viola, accordion and percussion. They sing in both Cornish and English.

Various members of Dalla formerly played in Bucca (a Cornish band named for the supernatural sea deities called Bucca), Sowena, Anao Atao and other bands. The music displays influences from these previous sounds. Dalla often appear with many additional instruments, which vary from event to event.

== Origins==
Dalla had its roots in &#x27;The Jack and Jenny Band&#x27;. In 1999 they became Sowena, and two years later, the band underwent a second transformation as remaining additional members left and Neil Davey joined to complete the classic Dalla sound. Dalla&#x27;s Myspace profile cites a wide range of influences.

==Influence==
Dalla has greatly influenced Cornish music, encouraging the formation of &#x27;Noze looan&#x27; bands, particularly by younger people and 

They have been involved in numerous Cornish music projects, run by Cumpas such as &#x27;kick up your heels&#x27; in which young people from across Cornwall played in a large underground concert at Carnglaze Caverns, or the &#x27;crowders and horners&#x27; project, to encourage processional Cornish music and dance.

==Review==
In the &quot;Cornish Guardian&quot;, Bert Biscoe wrote &quot;There is an intelligence that inhabits and underpins the various activities of Dalla...&quot;

== Members ==
*Hilary Coleman, clarinet, bass clarinet, vocals
*Neil Davey, fiddle, bouzouki
*Bec Applebee, vocals, crowdy crawn and other percussion
*Jen Dyer, viola, vocals
*Kyt Le Nen Davey, accordion
*Simon Lockley and Steve Hunt are former members of the group.

Although Dalla has a core of two to three members they rarely perform without additional musicians, and on such occasions when there are only two they are usually referred to as the &#x27;dalla duo&#x27;.

<text>Dallasite is a breccia made of subequant to rectangular or distinctly elongate, curvilinear shards that represent the spalled rims of pillow basalt (see: Hyaloclastite). This material is commonly partly altered to chlorite, epidote, quartz and carbonate, for which the local term &#x27;dallasite&#x27; has been coined. The stone dallasite is named after Dallas Road, Victoria, British Columbia. It is considered the unofficial stone of British Columbia&#x27;s capital city.

<doc id="1000616" wikidata="Q206445" url="?curid=1000616" title="No Prayer for the Dying">
<text>No Prayer for the Dying is the eighth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It is their first album to feature Janick Gers on guitar, who replaced Adrian Smith. Smith left the band during the pre-production phase, unhappy with the musical direction it was taking; he contributed to just one song, &quot;Hooks in You&quot;. This was the third song in the &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; saga. Gers previously worked with singer Bruce Dickinson on his first solo album, &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, and had also worked with Ian Gillan, former Marillion singer Fish, and new wave of British heavy metal band, White Spirit.

Although it received generally mixed to negative reviews, the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and contains the band&#x27;s only UK Singles Chart No. 1, &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;.

==Background==
The album departed from the keyboard- and synthesiser-saturated progressive rock direction of the band&#x27;s two previous studio outings (1986&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;) in favour of a more &quot;stripped down,&quot; straightforward style, reminiscent of the band&#x27;s earlier material, which ushered in a change of vocal style for Bruce Dickinson from the operatic sound of the 1980s to a raspier way of singing. In addition, Michael Kenney, who had played keyboards on tour for the band, played keyboards on the album, replacing Harris and Adrian Smith from previous albums. The idea to make a more &quot;street level&quot; release also inspired the band to record in a barn on bassist Steve Harris&#x27;s property in Essex, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. This means it is the first Iron Maiden album to be recorded in their home country since 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast.&quot; Dickinson states that this idea was a mistake, commenting that &quot;It was shit! It was a shit-sounding record, and I wished we hadn&#x27;t done it that way. At the time, I was as guilty as anyone else in going, &#x27;Oh great! Look, we&#x27;re all covered in straw! What a larf!&#x27;&quot;

The album also departed from literary and historical lyrical themes in favour of more political content, with songs focusing on religious exploitation (such as in the record&#x27;s first single, &quot;Holy Smoke&quot;) and social concerns (&quot;Public Enema Number One&quot;). &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; is the only Iron Maiden studio album to date without a song exceeding six minutes in length and the second one to contain profanity in the lyrics, the debut album being the first to do so. It was also the band&#x27;s first release with Epic Records in the US, after the band left Capitol Records, but was sold through EMI for all territories outside the US. Despite charting well in most countries, particularly in the UK where it debuted at No. 2, it would be the band&#x27;s last album to receive gold certification in the US.

&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; includes the hit song &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;, which, in spite of a ban by the BBC, remains Iron Maiden&#x27;s only UK No. 1 single to date. A tongue-in-cheek song written by Dickinson and originally recorded with his solo band for the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot; film soundtrack, Harris decided that the song would be &quot;great for Maiden&quot; and had the band re-record it.

Following Dickinson&#x27;s departure from Iron Maiden in 1993, songs from &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; have been largely ignored at live performances. &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; was the only song played on a post-1993 setlist, appearing on the band&#x27;s 2003 summer tour.

==Album cover==
&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; does not follow the continuity of previous album covers, as Eddie no longer exhibits either his lobotomy or cyborg enhancements.

Three versions of the cover exist. The original 1990 version has Eddie bursting from his grave and grabbing a gravedigger (with the likeness of the band&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood) by the neck. However, Smallwood disliked the figure and asked artist Derek Riggs to remove him from the cover for the 1998 re-release, although the original artwork is used on the disc itself. Additionally an inscription was added to the plaque on the tomb, which Riggs had initially left blank to allow the band to add their own words, and reads &quot;After the Daylight, The Night of Pain, That is not Dead, Which Can Rise Again.&quot; The picture disc LP shows Eddie firing a weapon made of four machine guns (a reference to the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Tailgunner&quot;). It has the original cover on side two.

The album title may have been inspired by the 1987 film &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally mixed to negative reviews, with AllMusic commenting that &quot;the songwriting wasn&#x27;t up to snuff when compared to such classics as &quot;Killers&quot; or &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;&quot; and &quot;as a whole doesn&#x27;t measure up to the hits.&quot; Sputnikmusic were equally negative, stating that &quot;&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; is a plain, listless record that never really gets itself going.&quot;

<doc id="1000624" wikidata="Q459352" url="?curid=1000624" title="La Silla Observatory">
<text>La Silla Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Chile with three telescopes built and operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Several other telescopes are also located at the site and are partly maintained by ESO. The observatory is one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere and was the first in Chile to be used by ESO.

The La Silla telescopes and instruments are located 150 km northeast of La Serena, on the outskirts of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest and most remote areas in the world. Like other observatories in this region, La Silla is far from sources of light pollution and, like the Paranal Observatory—home to the Very Large Telescope—it has some of the darkest night skies on Earth.

== History ==
Following the decision in 1963 to approve Chile as the site for the ESO observatory, scouting parties were sent to various locations to assess their suitability.
The site that was decided upon was La Silla in the southern part of the Atacama Desert, 600 km north of Santiago de Chile and at an altitude of 2400 metres. Besides being government property, it had the added benefits of being in a dry, flat and easily accessible area, yet isolated and remote from any artificial light and dust sources. Originally named the Cinchado, it was renamed La Silla (&quot;the saddle&quot; in Spanish) after its saddle-like shape. On October 30, 1964, the contracts were signed and an area of was purchased the following year. During 1965, temporary facilities were erected with living quarters, a workshop and storage area. The dedication ceremony of the road to the summit took place in March 1966, two months after completion of the road.

On 25 March 1969, the ESO site at La Silla was finally formally inaugurated by President Eduardo Frei Montalva. With a permanent base of dormitories, workshops, hotels and several functioning telescopes, the observatory was fully operational. The ESO 1.5-metre and ESO 1-metre telescopes had been erected in the late 1960s, and were joined in 1968 by the Gran Prismo Objectif telescope, which had previously been used in South Africa. These three telescopes can be seen in this order from right to left in the background of the image on the left from June 1968.

By 1976, the largest telescope planned, the , started operations. It was subsequently to have a 1.4m CAT (Coudé Auxiliary Telescope) attached. In 1984, the 2.2m telescope began operations, while in March 1989, the 3.5 m New Technology Telescope (NTT) saw first light. The program reached its apex with the installation of the SEST in 1987 (Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope), the only large submillimetre telescope in the southern hemisphere, which was a combined project between ESO and the Swedish Natural Science Research Council. Around the end of the century some of the original telescopes were closed: the 1m Schmidt closed in 1998 and the 1.5m in 2002, while new equipment owned by various foreign observatories was introduced. A 1-metre telescope owned by Marseille Observatory opened in 1998, followed by a 1.2-metre telescope from Geneva Observatory in 2000.
== Telescopes ==
ESO operates three major optical and near infrared telescopes at the La Silla site: the New Technology Telescope (NTT), the 3.6-m ESO Telescope, and the 2.2-m Max-Planck-ESO Telescope (MPG/ESO Telescope). In addition La Silla hosts several other national and project telescopes such as the ESO 1-metre Schmidt Telescope, the 1.54-m Danish Telescope, the 1.2-m Leonhard Euler Telescope, the Rapid Eye Mount telescope, TRAPPIST and TAROT. These telescopes are not operated by ESO and hence do not fall under the responsibility of La Silla Science Operations.

=== ESO 3.6 m Telescope ===

This 3.6 m Cassegrain telescope started operations in 1976 and has been constantly upgraded since, including the installation of a new secondary mirror that has kept the telescope in its place as one of the most efficient and productive engines of astronomical research. The telescope hosts HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher, the world&#x27;s foremost exoplanet hunter. HARPS is a spectrograph with unrivalled precision and is the most successful finder of low-mass exoplanets to date. Since 2022, the 3.6 m telescope has also hosted NIRPS, the Near Infra Red Planet Searcher.

=== New Technology Telescope ===

The ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an Alt-Az, 3.58-metre Richey-Chretien telescope which pioneered the use of active optics. The telescope and its enclosure had a revolutionary design for optimal image quality. NTT saw first light in March 1989. The telescope chamber is ventilated by a system of flaps which optimize the air flow across the NTT optimizing the dome and mirror seeing. To prevent heat input to the building, all motors in the telescope are water cooled and all the electronics boxes are insulated and cooled. The primary mirror of the NTT is actively controlled to preserve its figure at all telescope positions. The secondary mirror position is also actively controlled in three directions. The optimized airflow, the thermal controls, and the active optics give the excellent image quality of the NTT. The NTT has active instead of adaptive optics: it corrects the defects and deformation of the telescope and mirror, but does not correct the turbulence; it ensures that the optics is always in perfect shape. Together with the thermal control, it allows the NTT to reach the ambient seeing, but it does not improve it.

=== MPG/ESO 2.2 m Telescope ===

The 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at La Silla since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the Max Planck Society ( or MPG). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while the operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO&#x27;s responsibility. However, due to a new agreement between the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) and ESO, the instrument is operated by MPG until the end of September 2016. The telescope hosts three instruments: the 67-million pixel Wide Field Imager with a field of view as large as the full Moon, which has taken many amazing images of celestial objects; GROND, the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector, which chases the afterglows of the most powerful explosions in the Universe, known as gamma-ray bursts; and the high-resolution spectrograph, FEROS, used to make detailed studies of stars. MPG&#x27;s 2.2-metre telescope in La Silla also has a twin brother located at the Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain.

=== Other telescopes ===
La Silla also hosts several national and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among them are the Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.

==== ESO Schmidt telescope ====

: The ESO 1-metre Schmidt telescope, is a Schmidt telescope designed to provide a wide field of view of the sky—equivalent to about the area of 64 full Moons. Commissioned in 1971, it was one of the first telescopes operational at La Silla and was still using photographic plates at the time. These plates later confirmed the rediscovery of long-lost asteroids such as 1179 Mally and 843 Nicolaia.

: In 2009, the telescope was dedicated to the LaSilla–Quest Variability Survey, by Yale&#x27;s Department of Astronomy, and has since been used for astronomical surveys focused on the discovery of new Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), periodic variable stars, and supernovas.

: Yales&#x27;s 160-megapixel QUEST camera consists of a mosaic of 112 CCDs and covers about sixteen square degrees. This enables the remotely controlled project telescope to observe about a third of the night sky every four days. The La Silla–QUEST survey with the Schmidt telescope corresponds to the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey that was carried out in the Northern Hemisphere and led to the discovery of several trans-Neptunian objects and centaurs. In 1996, the telescope imaged 7968 Elst–Pizarro with a previously unseen cometary tail, which spawned a new class of celestial bodies called main-belt comet.

==== Euler telescope ====

: The Euler Telescope is a 1.2-metre telescope built and operated by the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. It uses the &quot;CORALIE&quot; spectrograph to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements, also known as the wobble method, primarily in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting Gliese 86. Other observing programmes focus on variable stars, asteroseismology, gamma-ray bursts, monitoring active galactic nuclei and gravitational lenses.

==== MASCARA ====

: MASCARA, the &quot;Multi-site all-sky camera&quot; station saw first light in July 2017. Built and operated by the Dutch Leiden University, the instrument is dedicated to search for exoplanets. MASCARA has a sibling station for the Northern hemisphere at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in Spain.

==== REM telescope ====

: The Rapid Eye Mount telescope (REM) is a small rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary mirror. The telescope, in an altazimuth mount, began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite.

==== TAROT ====

: The Quick-action telescope for transient objects, TAROT () is a very fast-moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a sub-arc second position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a fireball and its surrounding material. It is operated from the Haute-Provence Observatory in France.

==== Danish 1.54m Telescope ====

: The 1.54-metre Danish National Telescope was built by Grubb Parsons and has been in use at La Silla since 1979. The telescope has an off-axis mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. The telescope&#x27;s mount and the limited space inside the dome induce significant pointing restrictions.

==== TRAPPIST ====

: The Belgian robotic TRAPPIST, the &quot;TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope–South&quot;, is a joint venture between the University of Liège and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialized in comets and exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a stellar occultation of the dwarf planet Eris, revealing that it may be smaller than Pluto. It has recently gained fame following the discovery and categorisation of TRAPPIST-1, a planet system of seven near-earth like planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star. 


=== Former telescopes ===

The following telescopes have now been decommissioned:

* Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope (National telescope)
* Coudé Auxiliary 1.47-m Telescope (CAT), adjacent to ESO 3.6 Telescope
* Danish 0.5-metre Telescope (National telescope)
* Dutch 0.9-metre Telescope (National telescope)
* Grand Prism Objectif (GPO) Telescope
* ESO 0.5-metre telescope (now at the Observatorio UC in Santiago, Chile)
* ESO 1-metre telescope (1966–1994), used for DENIS 1996–2001
* ESO 1.52-metre telescope
* Marly 1-metre Telescope
* Marseille 0.4-metre Telescope (National telescope)
* Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST), 15-metre
* Swiss T70 telescope (1980–1998, now home of TRAPPIST)
* Swiss 0.4-metre telescope (1975–1980, replaced by T70)
The Swiss T70 telescope was a 70 cm aperture telescope for photometry that had a first light in 1980. It was retired in 1998, when the Euler Telescope was commissioned. The Swiss T70 was a Cassegrain reflector design mounted on an Equatorial fork mount. It was equipped with a P7 Photometer, and replaced the Swiss 0.4-metre telescope, which was in use from November 1975 until March 1980. As with the Euler Telescope, the Swiss T70 and 0.4-metre telescopes were operated by the Geneva Observatory.

==Scientific discoveries==

About 300 scientific papers based on observations taken at La Silla are published each year. The HARPS spectrograph has found a large number of low-mass extrasolar planets. It detected the planets within the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains what may be the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone, outside the Solar System. Several telescopes at La Silla played a crucial role in linking gamma-ray bursts—the most energetic explosions in the Universe since the Big Bang—with the explosions of massive stars. Since 1987, the ESO La Silla Observatory has also played an important role in the study and follow-up of the nearest recent supernova, SN 1987A.

== Signs of a pre-Hispanic culture ==

Hundreds of rock engravings, also called petroglyphs, can be found all around La Silla. These are attributed to the 300 to 700 CE El Molle culture. The El Molle culture have their origin as hunter-gatherers that developed a new way of life based on horticulture and village life. They are known for their pottery and body ornaments, such as necklaces and the tembetás.

There are three types of petroglyph designs at La Silla: human and animal figures, abstract geometrical designs and purely ornamental ensembles. Beside the petroglyphs there exists also a stone circle near La Silla, which is suggested as an astronomical tool. Three rocks aligned during the El Molle culture with Alpha Carinae, Beta Carinae and Alpha Centauri or Beta Centauri. This alignment occurred during late April and during May and could signal the beginning of the cold season. Farmers could have used this tool to determine when to move their herds, mostly camelidae, into their villages. There are signs of illicit excavations at La Silla since the 1990s and in 2017 some vandalism was discovered.

Another ESO site with archaeological testimonies in its vicinity is the ALMA site.

<doc id="1000625" wikidata="Q1109203" url="?curid=1000625" title="Ken'ichi Enomoto">
<text>was a popular Japanese singing comedian, mostly known by his stage name Enoken (エノケン).

A major innovator during his heyday, Enoken&#x27;s stage shows, radio appearances, and film roles were a major influence within Tokyo theatre before World War II, and was a catalyst for the revival of comedy in the postwar period.

Born in Aoyama, Tokyo, the son of rice cracker shop owners, Enomoto fell under the spell of such stars of the Asakusa Opera as Taya Rikizo and Fujiwara Yoshie, and in 1922 he made his stage debut at age 18 as a chorus member of the Asakusa Kinryukan Theatre. The Great Kantō earthquake of the following year dealt a great blow to the opera world in Tokyo, at which time Enomoto shifted to comic theatre. Playing small roles in various comedy productions, he returned to the Asakusa stage in 1929 as part of the troupe Casino Folies. The following year saw him launch his own troupe, Enoken Gekidan, which would firmly establish him as a leading figure in Tokyo theatrical circles. In 1934, he starred in the movie &quot;Enoken no Seishun Suikoden&quot; (Enoken&#x27;s Tale of Youth&#x27;s Folly), and gained national popularity. His subsequent film career saw him parody a whole parade of Japanese historical personages, including Kondō Isami and Sakamoto Ryōma, in a series of &quot;jidai-geki&quot; (historical dramas) and &quot;chanbara&quot; (samurai drama) films, including some directed by Kajirō Yamamoto, Nobuo Nakagawa and Akira Kurosawa.

Enomoto became afflicted with necrosis of the right leg in the 1950s, which required amputation, curtailing his film and stage career. He did, however, make a legendary comeback at the Shinjuku Koma Theater 1963 wearing a prosthetic leg. He died in 1970, and is entombed in Hase Temple in Nishi-Azabu, Minato, Tokyo, on whose tombstone is inscribed &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;.

<doc id="1000626" wikidata="Q10914152" url="?curid=1000626" title="Paranal Observatory">
<text>Paranal Observatory is an astronomical observatory operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). It is located in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile on Cerro Paranal at altitude, south of Antofagasta. By total light-collecting area, it is the largest optical-infrared observatory in the Southern Hemisphere; worldwide, it is second to the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii.

The Very Large Telescope (VLT), the largest telescope on Paranal, is composed of four separate telescopes. In addition, the four main telescopes can be used simultaneously for extra light gathering capacity, and for interferometry. Four auxiliary telescopes of each are also part of the VLTI to make it available when the main telescopes are being used for other projects. The site also houses two survey telescopes with wide fields of view, the VISTA and the VLT Survey Telescope for surveying large areas of the sky; and two arrays of small telescopes called NGTS and SPECULOOS which are dedicated to searching for exoplanets.

Two major new facilities are under construction nearby: the southern part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array gamma-ray telescope (not owned by ESO) will be sited in the grounds 10 km south-east of Paranal; while ESO&#x27;s future E-ELT will be on the nearby peak of Cerro Armazones 20 km east of Paranal, and will share some of the base facilities.

== Telescopes ==

===Aerial view ===

From an aerial view of the Paranal Observatory, the four large units of the VLT with their four small, dome-shaped auxiliary telescopes can be clearly seen. The Survey Telescope, VST, is immediately adjacent to the VLT and seen in between two of its units, while VISTA is located on a secondary peak, some 1,500 m away in the background &quot;(see image)&quot;.

=== Very Large Telescope ===
The Very Large Telescope (VLT) consists of four 8.2-metre telescopes operating in the visible and infrared. These telescopes, along with four smaller auxiliary telescopes, are also combined to operate as an optical interferometer on certain nights of the year. All of the 8.2-metre telescopes have adaptive optics and a full suite of instruments. The primary mirrors of the main telescopes are 8.2 meters in diameter but, in practice, the pupil of the telescopes is defined by the secondary mirrors, effectively limiting the usable diameter to 8.0 meters.

=== VISTA Survey Telescope ===
VISTA is the &quot;Visible &amp; Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy&quot;, a 4.0-metre telescope with a wide field of view, focusing on infrared surveys of the sky. It was built close to ESO&#x27;s VLT by a consortium of 18 universities from the United Kingdom, led by Queen Mary University of London. VISTA was handed over to the European Southern Observatory in December 2009.

=== VLT Survey Telescope (VST) ===
The VLT Survey Telescope or VST is a 2.6-metre telescope with a wide field imager intended to aid the four Very Large Telescope (VLTs) in their scientific aims.

=== Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) === 
The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is an exoplanet-survey facility located a few kilometers from the main peak. It consists of an array of twelve 0.2-meter robotic telescopes with a very large field of view of 96 square degrees or several hundred times the area of the full moon. The survey aims to discover numerous super-Earths and Neptune-sized planets around nearby stars, using transit photometry to detect them. NGTS is managed by a partnership of seven academic institutions from Chile, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and its design is based on the SuperWASP project. Science operations began in early 2015.

=== SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) ===

The SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) consists out of four telescopes, called Europa, Io, Callisto, and Ganymede. ESO hosts the 1-meter telescopes and the project is led by the University of Liège. The project aims to find exoplanets around ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. The project builds on the success of the TRAPPIST telescope. The telescopes are located next to the NGTS.

== Other buildings ==
As well as the telescopes, control buildings and maintenance facilities, Paranal has a Residencia which provides accommodation for staff and visitors. This is located 200 m lower and 3 km from the telescopes. It is built half into the mountain with the concrete coloured to blend into the landscape. It has gym facilities, a swimming pool, a restaurant and two gardens. The construction was decorated by the Chilean architect Paula Gutiérrez Erlandsen, Marchioness of la Pica.

== Popular culture and other uses ==

To illustrate the isolation of the Paranal Observatory from the lights of civilization, it is located in straight-line distance north of Paposo, population 259, the nearest community to the observatory.

The VLT hotel, the Residencia, served as a backdrop for part of the 2008 James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;.

The observatory&#x27;s facilities were used to stage the Pacific Alliance&#x27;s fourth summit in June 2012, formally launching the organization.

On 14 March 2013, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, accompanied by his wife, Princess Mary, visited ESO&#x27;s Paranal Observatory, as part of an official visit to Chile. Their tour of Paranal&#x27;s astronomical facilities was led by ESO&#x27;s Director General, Tim de Zeeuw.

<text>nesC (pronounced &quot;NES-see&quot;) is a component-based, event-driven programming language used to build applications for the TinyOS platform. TinyOS is an operating environment designed to run on embedded devices used in distributed wireless sensor networks. nesC is built as an extension to the C programming language with components &quot;wired&quot; together to run applications on TinyOS. The name &quot;nesC&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;network embedded systems C&quot;.

==Components and interfaces==
nesC programs are built out of components, which are assembled (&quot;wired&quot;) to form whole programs. Components have internal concurrency in the form of tasks. Threads of control may pass into a component through its interfaces. These threads are rooted either in a task or a hardware interrupt. 

Interfaces may be provided or used by components. The provided interfaces are intended to represent the functionality that the component provides to its user, the used interfaces represent the functionality the component needs to perform its job. 

In nesC, interfaces are bidirectional: They specify a set of functions to be implemented by the interface&#x27;s provider (commands) and a set to be implemented by the interface&#x27;s user (events). This allows a single interface to represent a complex interaction between components (e.g., registration of interest in some event, followed by a callback when that event happens). This is critical because all lengthy commands in TinyOS (e.g. send packet) are non-blocking; their completion is signaled through an event (send done). By specifying interfaces, a component cannot call the send command unless it provides an implementation of the sendDone event. Typically commands call downwards, i.e., from application components to those closer to the hardware, while events call upwards. Certain primitive events are bound to hardware interrupts. 

Components are statically linked to each other via their interfaces. This increases runtime efficiency, encourages robust design, and allows for better static analysis of programs.

<text>New Orleans English is American English native to the city of New Orleans and its metropolitan area. Native English speakers of the region actually speak a number of varieties, including the variety most recently brought in and spreading since the 20th century among white communities of the Southern United States in general (Southern U.S. English); the variety primarily spoken by black residents (African-American Vernacular English); the variety spoken by Cajuns in southern Louisiana (Cajun English); the variety traditionally spoken by affluent white residents of the city&#x27;s Uptown and Garden District; and the variety traditionally spoken by lower middle- and working-class white residents of Eastern New Orleans, particularly the Ninth Ward (sometimes known, since at least the 1980s, as Yat). However, only the last two varieties are unique to New Orleans and are typically those referred to in the academic research as &quot;New Orleans English&quot;. These two varieties specific to New Orleans likely developed around the turn of the nineteenth century and most noticeably combine speech features commonly associated with both New York City English and, to a lesser extent, Southern U.S. English. The noticeably New York-like characteristics include the NYC-like short-&quot;a&quot; split (so that &quot;mad&quot; and &quot;map&quot;, for example, do not have the same vowel), non-rhoticity, &quot;th&quot;-stopping (so that, for example, &quot;those&quot; may sound like &quot;doze&quot;), and the recently disappearing coil–curl merger. Noticeably Southern characteristics include the fronting of and possible monophthongization of (just these features, plus non-rhoticity, often characterize the Uptown accent).

Often, the term &quot;Yat&quot; refers particularly to the New Orleans accents that are &quot;strongest&quot; or most especially reminiscent of a working-class New York City accent, though others use the term as a regional marker, to define the speech heard in certain parts of the city and its inner suburbs. Used in these narrower senses, Yat is simply one of many sub-dialects of New Orleans. The word comes from the common use of the local greeting, &quot;Where y&#x27;at?&quot; or &quot;Where are you at (i.e. in life)?&quot;, which is a way of asking, &quot;How are you?&quot;

==History==
A unique New Orleans accent, or &quot;Yat&quot; accent, is considered an identity marker of white metropolitan people who have been raised in the greater New Orleans area. English professor Allan A. Metcalf discusses that &quot;Yats&quot; mostly live near the Irish Channel in blue-collar neighborhoods. The dialect&#x27;s connotation with the working-class white population therefore encodes the speaker&#x27;s identities. 

The striking similarity between the New Orleans Yat accent and the accent of the New York metropolitan area has been the subject of much speculation. Plausible origins of the accent are described in A. J. Liebling&#x27;s book &quot;The Earl of Louisiana&quot;, in a passage that was used as a foreword to &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s well-known posthumously published novel about New Orleans:

In the decades following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, when New Orleans changed from being a French colonial possession to an American city, Irish, German, and eventually Italian (largely Sicilian) immigrants indeed began populating the city. However, rather than believing the New York and New Orleans dialects evolved similarly merely due to a similar mixture of European immigrant populations, modern linguists believe that the dialect histories of New Orleans and New York City actually have a direct relationship: significant commercial and demographic interactions between the two cities. Although exact linguistic theories vary, the broad consensus is that key New York accent features probably diffused to New Orleans by the late 19th century. Large-scale movements (permanent or seasonal) of working-class, lower middle-class, and merchant-class Northeastern Americans of European immigrant families to New Orleans may have brought along their native Northeastern (namely, New York City) accent features. Even during the antebellum era, Northerners made up over a quarter of all free, white, non-immigrant residents of New Orleans. Linguist William Labov specifically argues that Jewish American bankers and cotton merchants strongly affiliated with New York City were the biggest influence on upper-class accents (and presumably, the eventual accents of all classes) in New Orleans. He cites examples of Sephardic and German Jewish connections to influential mercantile firms in 19th-century New Orleans.

==Phonology==
Many of the features bear a direct relation to Southern American English or New York City English, when not common across the United States more broadly. Of the &quot;Yat&quot; dialect features, the most distinct ones are:
*No cot–caught merger, as in regional American accents. There is a father–bother merger, but the merged becomes or in rhotic environments.
*Stressed and becoming or (i.e., &#x27;God,&#x27; &#x27;on,&#x27; &#x27;talk&#x27;, become , , and , respectively).
*Non-rhoticity; &#x27;heart&#x27; and &#x27;fire&#x27; become and , respectively. 
**The coil–curl merger: phonemes and , creating the diphthong , before a consonant. The feature has receded, but not as much as in New York City. Sometimes, the exact opposite occurs, the full rhotacization of a syllable-internal (i.e. &#x27;toilet,&#x27; becomes ); this is more typical in men than in women.
*Th-stopping, pronouncing the &quot;th&quot; sounds like &#x27;t&#x27; or &#x27;d&#x27;. 
*A variable &quot;horse–hoarse merger&quot;
* or used for unstressed and final . this makes &#x27;running&#x27; sound like &#x27;runnin&#x27;.
*Splitting the historic &#x27;short a&#x27; vowel into tense and lax versions. New Orleans&#x27; system most closely resembles New York City&#x27;s, but also applies to voiced fricatives and function words.
*-monophthongization, resulting in . this is common to many Southeastern United States accents.
**However, the Canadian raising of both /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ can also be heard among younger speakers 
*Shifting the stress of some words, such as &quot;insurance&quot;, to the first syllable. This also occurs in the broader Southeastern United States, and many forms of AAVE.

There are some words with phonemic peculiarities, but according to no particular pattern; including &#x27;sink&#x27; , &#x27;room&#x27; , &#x27;mayonnaise&#x27; , &#x27;museum&#x27; , &#x27;ask&#x27; .

New Orleans is locally pronounced or , with the &quot;New&quot; destressed. The slurred, stereotypical &quot;N&#x27;awlins&quot; and the General American are not often heard from natives. Louisiana can be pronounced as the standard or a slightly reduced in the &#x27;Yat&#x27; dialect.

Black New Orleanians adopt most features of the African-American Vowel Shift, which they share with Black residents of Acadiana. Compared with Black New Iberians though, Black New Orleanians had in-gliding and less diphthongized .

== Vocabulary ==
== Local variance ==

The Yat accent is the most pronounced version of the New Orleans accent, and is perceptually similar to a New York accent. As with all dialects, there is variance in the accent to geographic and social factors like one&#x27;s exact locational or financial background. 

Speakers of this dialect originated in the Ninth Ward, as well as the Irish Channel and Mid-City. Lighter features of the dialect can be heard in some parts of the city, such as Lakeview, the Marigny, the Garden District, and some parts of Gentilly, but mainly in the suburbs. The dialect is present to some degree in all seven parishes that make up the New Orleans metropolitan area, from St. Tammany to Plaquemines. As with many sociolinguistic artifacts in the 21st century, the dialect is usually more distinct among older members of the population. The New Orleans suburban area of Chalmette shows the strongest Yat accent.

==In popular culture==

The distinct New Orleans dialect has been depicted in many ways throughout the city and the U.S.

The main character of the cartoon strip &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; spoke in a slightly exaggerated phonetically-rendered version of early-20th century Yat; friends of the New Orleans-born cartoonist George Herriman recalled that he spoke with many of the same distinctive pronunciations.

Actual New Orleans accents were seldom heard nationally. New Orleanians who attained national prominence in the media often made an effort to tone down or eliminate the most distinctive local pronunciations. Dan Baum&#x27;s &quot;Nine Lives&quot; shares the feelings of Ronald Lewis, a native of the Ninth Ward who is embarrassed by his local dialect when speaking in front of a group of white northerners. After the displacement of Greater New Orleans area residents because of Hurricane Katrina, the United States was introduced to some of the New Orleans Yat accents by constant news coverage. Steven Seagal&#x27;s show &quot;Lawman&quot; exposed some Yat accents and dialects to the nation.

Ronnie Virgets, a New Orleans writer, commentator, and journalist, employs New Orleans dialects and accents in his written and spoken works, including the locally produced public radio program, &quot;Crescent City&quot;. WWNO, the local public radio station, broadcasts the program and provides access to past &quot;Crescent City&quot; programs on its website.

The name of the official mascot for the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, held in New Orleans, was derived from the truncated pronunciation of &quot;See More of the Fair,&quot; which results in the pseudo yat speak &quot;Seymore D. Fair.&quot;

A Midwest Cajun restaurant chain based in Indianapolis, Indiana carries the name Yats.

Cellphone company Boost Mobile used the phrase &quot;Where Y&#x27;At?&quot; in early advertising campaigns.

Who Dat? is a chant commonly tied to the Yat dialect and used in support of the New Orleans Saints football team. The entire chant is &quot;Who dat? Who dat? Who dat say dey gonna beat dem Saints?&quot; Saints fans are collectively called the &quot;Who Dat Nation.&quot;

The Yat dialect is seldom heard when New Orleans is depicted in movies and television shows. Traditionally, characters portrayed from New Orleans are heard using a southern or Cajun accent. An example of this is 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, in which Dennis Quaid speaks an exaggerated Cajun/southern derivation. This trend has been challenged, though, in light of post-Katrina New Orleans representation, like HBO&#x27;s &quot;Treme&quot; and Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot;, both of which feature actual New Orleans locals either speaking in Yat or one of its variations.

==Other local dialects and misconceptions==
Historically, the city of New Orleans has been home to people of French, Spanish, and African heritages, which led to the creation of the Louisiana Creole language, before this city came under U.S. rule in the Louisiana Purchase. Over the course of the 19th century, the city transitioned from speaking French to becoming a non-rhotic English-speaking society. Similarly, much of the South has historically spoken non-rhotic English.

A misconception in other parts of the U.S. is that the local dialect of New Orleans is the same as Cajun English (spoken in several other areas of South Louisiana), but the city&#x27;s cultural and linguistic traditions are distinct from that of the predominantly rural Acadiana, an area spanning across South Louisiana. While there has been an influx of Cajuns into the city since the oil boom of the later 20th century and while there are some similarities due to shared roots, Cajun culture has had relatively little influence upon Creole culture and thus Yat culture. The confusion of Cajun culture with the Creole culture is largely due to the confusion of these French cultures by the tourism and entertainment industries; sometimes this was done deliberately, as &quot;Cajun&quot; was often discovered to be a potentially lucrative marketing term. Speakers with a &quot;New Orleans accent&quot; are typically proud of their accent as it organically stems from the historical mixing of language and culture. This distinctive accent has been dying out generationally in the city due to white flight of the city, but remains very strong in the suburbs. However, the Yat dialect does survive in the city in several areas, notably Mid-city, Lakeview, parts of Gentilly and Uptown.

Dawe was a regular collaborator of fellow satirist the late John Clarke in the form of mock interviews, first for &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and then for &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot;. Dawe would take on the role of interviewer, with Clarke playing the role of a prominent figure or politician. Unusually for topical satire of this type-such as one of Clarke&#x27;s earlier ventures, &quot;The Gillies Report&quot; (1984-1985)-Clarke never attempted to explicitly impersonate the figures he represents and always performed them in his own voice and manner. The format generally involved Dawe trying to press for an answer and Clarke trying to evade the question. The duo began writing and presenting the segments in 1989 and switched to &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; not long after leaving &quot;A Current Affair&quot; in 1997. The pair continued to present their weekly interview segment at the end of the Thursday edition of &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot;. During the 2014 Australian television season, &quot;Clarke and Dawe&quot; became a self-contained program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The interviews have also been compiled into several books and CD releases, two of which, &quot;Great Interviews of the Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;The Annual Report&quot;, won the ARIA Award for Best Australian Comedy Record. &quot;Secret Men&#x27;s Business&quot; was nominated for the same award in 1997.

==Other roles==
Dawe has a number of other roles outside of his interview collaborations with Clarke. He is a songwriter, winning (along with musician Steve Groves) the Australian Song Festival and then representing Australia in Tokyo at the World Song Festival. Prior to this, in the early 1970s, he worked as an A&amp;R manager for Astor Records and played a significant role in making the Neil Diamond album &quot;Hot August Night&quot; a major hit in Australia. He is also a painter and photographer and has featured in several gallery exhibitions which combine these two interests.
In the 1980s he wrote and performed with actress Jody Seidel in a long-running radio comedy series centred on the characters of elderly couple Roly and Sonya Parks. In 1990, after four years as head of ABC Radio&#x27;s comedy unit, he had a stint as both a writer and actor on the comedy series &quot;Fast Forward&quot;. Dawe had a minor role in the successful Australian film &quot;The Castle&quot; in 1997. However, of these, the most successful was his role, along with Clarke, in the satirical series &quot;The Games&quot;. The series was a mockumentary about the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and ran from 1998 to 2000. Dawe also had a minor role in the 2003 film &quot;The Honourable Wally Norman&quot;.

In addition to his interview commitments, Dawe regularly appears on the speaker&#x27;s circuit as an MC, as guest speaker: either as himself or as one of his alter egos, Sir Murray Rivers QC (retired). Dawe has written and performed extensively on ABC Radio with his satirical characters Sir Murray Rivers and Roly Parks. Some of his Roly Park&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Kalangadoo&quot; segments have subsequently been released on a series of CDs.

Dawe has been chair of Common Fate, a not for profit organisation supporting the reconciliation work of Aboriginal leaders Pat Dodson and Paul Briggs. He is a longtime supporter of the fight for a Palestine homeland. He is also an inveterate traveller and has written various articles and a radio series on his travels. He has organised and conducted group tours to Eastern Europe, Syria and Jordan.

In 2012, Dawe had a guest role in the third season of the Australian drama series &quot;Tangle&quot;.

<text>High rail (also called &quot;hi-rail&quot; and &quot;hirail&quot;) is a phrase used in model railroading in North America, mostly in O scale and S scale, to describe a &quot;compromise&quot; form of modelling that strives for realism while accepting the compromises in scale associated with toy train equipment. The phrase exists due to the observation that traditional Lionel and American Flyer toy train track sits much higher than finescale track.

The compromises that were traditionally made in manufacturing these trains have led to three approaches to model railroading in these two scales.

The traditional toy train layout makes little, if any, effort at realism and often makes use of unpainted plastic buildings, particularly the Plasticville brand, and other toys, making little or no effort to disguise their origin. In some cases, the buildings, vehicles, and figures on the layout may not even be the same scale as the train, or each other. Roads, grass, and roadbed may be painted onto the table surface, or may be represented with low-pile carpet.

Scale modeling also occurs in O and S scales, just like in HO or N scales, where the modeler tries to create a miniature world that is as realistic as possible. Scale modelers in O and S scales will often avoid, or at least make limited use of, traditional American Flyer and Lionel locomotives and rolling stock since it sometimes was not very true to scale, was lacking in detail, and used oversized knuckle couplers. Scale modelers use O gauge track, but with two rails rather than the three rails used by Lionel, and the trains run on direct current. Numerous standards for track that is more true to scale exist for both O and S scales.

High rail is an in-between approach. High-railers live with the out-of-scale track and will make use of off-the-shelf diecast vehicles that may be slightly out of scale, especially in O scale because true 1:48 scale vehicles are scarce, whereas 1:43 and 1:50 scale diecast vehicles are very common. Some use vintage Lionel and American Flyer trains, while others opt to use modern equivalents built to greater detail. High railers often will repaint and weather their trains, vehicles, and buildings, just as a scale model railroader would. Sometimes they will go to great lengths to try to conceal the middle rail on Lionel track, and will replace the oversized couplers that came with their trains from the factory with scale versions. High railers are less likely to engage in scratch building than their scale modeling counterparts, but many engage in kitbashing and super-detailing their buildings and structures.

Some manufacturers, particularly in S scale, will offer rolling stock with either scale or high-rail trucks and couplers, in order to cater to all potential markets.

<text>Peeks Creek is a stream located in Macon County, North Carolina. It is a tributary of the Cullasaja River, into which it flows a few miles or kilometers upstream of Franklin.

== History ==
In September 2004, it had a catastrophic flood and mudslide, after massive rains left over from Hurricane Ivan struck the same area soaked by former Hurricane Frances a week before. The slide started on Fishhawk Mountain (also called Big Fish Hawk Mountain), where it continued into the creek. The slide and the water dammed up behind a bridge, then broke through, making the creek about or meters wide instead of the normal two or three. The mass of trees, boulders, and mud forced at least fifteen houses off their foundations, one man riding his home about downstream. Another home was pierced by a tree from end to end, the picture appearing in a local newspaper.

The area of the slide is about two miles (3 km) or three kilometers long, with much of the mud and some of the smaller debris continuing into and down the Cullasaja.

The unincorporated community of Peeks Creek was devastated by the historic event, with at least five people killed.

<text>are traditional Japanese entryway areas for a house, apartment, or building, a combination of a porch and a doormat. It is usually located inside the building directly in front of the door. The primary function of is for the removal of shoes before entering the main part of the house or building.

A secondary function is a place for brief visits without being invited across the step into the house proper. For example, where a pizza delivery driver in an English-speaking country would normally stand on the porch and conduct business through the open front door, in Japan a food delivery would traditionally have taken place across the step.

After removing shoes, one must avoid stepping on the tiled or concrete in socks or with bare feet, to avoid bringing dirt into the house. Once inside, generally one will change into : slippers or shoes intended for indoor wear.

The height of the step varies from very low () to shin-level or knee-level. in apartments are usually much smaller than those in houses, and may have no difference in elevation with the rest of the floor; it may simply have a different type of flooring material than the rest of the floor to distinguish it as the .

Schools and have large with compartments for each person&#x27;s outdoor shoes. In private residences, may be absent, and shoes are usually turned to face the door so they can be slipped on easily when leaving.

== History ==
The custom of removing one&#x27;s shoes before entering the house is believed to go back over one thousand years to the pre-historical era of elevated-floor structures. It has continued to the present, even after the Westernization of the Japanese home, which began in the Meiji period (1868–1912).

<doc id="1000664" wikidata="Q7605585" url="?curid=1000664" title="Stedelen">
<text>Stedelen (dead c. 1400) was a man who was accused of being a witch in Boltigen, Switzerland between 1397 and 1406.

==Background==
After the harvest had failed at his village, Stedelen was accused of using black magic to destroy the crops, killing cattle and also sacrificing a black rooster on the Sabbath at a crossroad and placing a lizard under the doorway of a local church. 

Peter von Greyerz, the judge of Simmental between 1398–1406, was a firm believer in witchcraft, which he believed had been introduced in Simmental by a noble man called Scavius in 1375, who claimed he could transform himself to a mouse (as recorded in Johannes Nider&#x27;s seminal work &quot;Formicarius&quot;). Scavius was slaughtered by his enemies, but he had a student, Hoppo, who, according to Greyerz, had been the tutor of Stedelen. 

There are no records about Hoppo, but Stedelen from Boltigen had allegedly been made an expert on magic by Hoppo, and supposedly learned to steal manure, hay and such from others&#x27; fields to his own by magic, create hail and thunderstorms, make people and animals sterile, make horses crazy when he touched their hooves, fly, and scare those who captured him. Greyerz also accused Stedelen of having taken the milk from the cows of a married couple in order to make the wife miscarry.

== Trial ==

His trial took place in a secular court, Stedelen admitted to the charge (under torture) of summoning forth demons as part of a pact with the Devil and being part of a cult. Stedelen was burned at the stake.

Greyerz believed there existed a satanic cult, whose members swore themselves to the Devil and ate children at the churches at night. He continued his persecutions and once tortured a woman to confirm this.

<doc id="1000667" wikidata="Q6942225" url="?curid=1000667" title="Music of Nova Scotia">
<text>In the province of Nova Scotia in Canada, Celtic music has played a significant role, both in its traditional forms and fused with other musical styles. Nova Scotia&#x27;s folk music features traditional tunes brought over from the Scottish Highlands in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as well as localized forms such as Cape Breton fiddle music. In recent years, a wide variety of other musical genres have emerged in Nova Scotia, which has produced several country music stars such as Hank Snow, Wilf Carter, Anne Murray, and Rita MacNeil. 

==Settler cultures==
Nova Scotia is one of three Canadian Maritime provinces, or simply, The Maritimes. When combined with Newfoundland and Labrador the region is known as the Atlantic Provinces, or Atlantic Canada.

Despite the small population of the province, Nova Scotia&#x27;s music and culture are influenced by several well-established cultural groups, that are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Founding Cultures.&quot;

First populated by the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation, the first European settlers were the French, who founded Acadia in 1604. Nova Scotia was briefly colonized by Scottish settlers in 1620, though by 1624, the Scottish settlers had been removed by treaty and the area was turned over to the French until the mid-18th century. After the defeat of the French and prior expulsion of the Acadians, settlers of English, Irish, Scottish and African descent began arriving on the shores of Nova Scotia.

Settlement was greatly accelerated by the resettlement of Loyalists (called in Canada United Empire Loyalists) to Nova Scotia during the period following the end of the American Revolutionary War. It was during this time that a large African Nova Scotian community took root, populated by freed slaves and Black Loyalists and their families, who had fought for the Crown in exchange for land. This community later grew when the Royal Navy began intercepting slave ships destined for the United States, and deposited these free slaves on the shores of Nova Scotia.

Later, in the 19th century, the Irish Great Hunger and Scottish Highland Clearances resulted in large influxes of migrants with Celtic cultural roots, which helped to define the dominantly Celtic character of Cape Breton and the north mainland of the province. This Celtic, or Gaelic, culture was so pervasive that at the outset of World War I, reporters from London, England were horrified when some of the first regiments to arrive in England from Canada piped themselves ashore, styled themselves as &quot;Highland Regiments&quot; and spoke Scottish Gaelic as their primary language.

==Traditional music in the contemporary era==

Nova Scotia&#x27;s traditional music scene is largely influence by Mi&#x27;kmaw and settler cultures. Their legacy includes several Juno Awards winners and nominees, along with global staples in the traditional arts. There is also a strong folk music culture, including Stan Rogers, who was born in Ontario to a Nova Scotian family, and sang ballads of seagoing Maritimers, though again little reflecting the area&#x27;s Scottish traditions. An annual music festival is named in his honour. 

===Scottish Influence===

Scottish traditional music has remained vibrant throughout the province into the 21st century, most notably in the northern region and Cape Breton, and has produced several performers of international renown. The influence of Scottish culture is woven into the folk music of the province. A prime example of this is Cape Breton&#x27;s Rita MacNeil, a mainstream singer whose music combined country/folk with the Scottish culture around her, including recording her show &quot;Celtic Fantasy.&quot; 

The province is the heart of two vibrant and popular styles of Celtic music and dance derived from the influence of its Highland Scottish settlement. On Cape Breton Island, the prevalent Scottish culture has influenced the creation of the Cape Breton Celtic style, while on the mainland, &quot;down-east&quot; old time fiddling, popularized by Don Messer, is spread throughout. 

With Cape Breton music, the basic duo of fiddle and piano provide a strongly-accented dance music in small-town church and community halls. Sometimes a guitar is augmented, and Highland bagpipe music is also popular. One of the first popular musicians who showed Nova Scotia&#x27;s Celtic heritage to the mainstream world was John Allan Cameron, a singer and guitarist, and son of legendary fiddler Katie Ann Cameron, who was herself the sister of the music collector Dan Rory MacDonald. Cameron is consider the &#x27;Godfather of Celtic Music&#x27;, and received an Order of Canada for his accomplishments. Cape Breton has a well-known bagpipe tradition as well, and has produced some well-known pipers, including Angus MacDonald, Barry Shears and Jamie MacInnes.

More recent performers with a Celtic sound in their music include the pop crooning of Sarah McLachlan from Halifax, Mary Jane Lamond and flautist Chris Norman. Mi&#x27;kmaw fiddler Morgan Toney, a Juno Awards nominee, often combines Cape Breton Celtic music into traditional Mi&#x27;kmaw songs. 

With Cape Breton Celtic music, however, it&#x27;s the fiddle that reigns supreme. A big name in this tradition is Winston &quot;Scotty&quot; Fitzgerald from Cape Breton. Also of his generation were a litany of names now known in the international scene, though renown came late for most; these include Joe MacLean, Bill Lamey, Buddy MacMaster, Alex Francis MacKay, Dan Joe MacInnes, Angus Chisholm, Dan Hughie MacEachern, Donald Angus Beaton, Theresa MacLellan, Joe Cormier and Paddy LeBlanc. Many of these were first given distribution outside of the area by American folk label Rounder Records, which began a Cape Breton unit in the early 1970s.The Rankin Family further contributed to bring Cape Breton folk music to mainstream audiences in Canada and abroad. They had performed as a family since childhood, playing traditional music that gradually became more modern as their fame grew.

Perhaps the most well-known modern Cape Breton fiddler is Natalie MacMaster, who comes from a line of musicians that includes Buddy MacMaster, Wendy MacIsaac and Ashley MacIsaac. MacMaster has toured globally and won two Juno Awards. Her cousin, Ashley MacIsaac, is notable for having achieved success playing both traditional music and radical musical fusions, exemplified by his &quot;Hi™ How Are You Today?&quot; (1995), a landmark recording.

On the mainland, the popular &quot;down-east&quot; style is largely derived from a mix of Scottish and old time music. It was featured in &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;, which was the number one most show in Canada outside of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, along with the &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;. The style of fiddling became a common feature for country exhibitions and square dancing. The Maritime Fiddle Festival, which is the longest running fiddle festival in Canada, has helped to keep the traditional music alive and has attracted top old time fiddlers from across North America to its competition. Notable fiddlers include Lee Cremo, J.P. Cormier, and Gordon Stobbe.

===Irish Influence===

Irish settlements on the mainland of Nova Scotia further influenced a rise in Irish traditional music Popular especially in Guysborough County and Halifax. The annual Halifax Celtic Festival often includes several Irish musicians, and Irish-themed pubs with live music are common throughout the province.

==Popular music of Nova Scotia==

Despite the dominance of traditional based music, both as a form of cultural expression, and as a means to brand the tourism experience for visitors to Nova Scotia, the province also has a long history of producing successful popular music acts. Many notable, internationally known artists are from Nova Scotia, in a wide variety of genres.

===The early years===
As early as the 1930s the music of Nova Scotia was entertaining the world. Hank Snow, born and raised in Brooklyn, Queen&#x27;s County, Nova Scotia, was signed to RCA Records in 1936, but became famous in 1950 when he was invited to appear at the Grand Ole Opry. That was also the year he released &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On,&quot; his first massive hit single.

Portia White of Truro, Nova Scotia, one of the greatest contralto voices in the history of Canadian classical music, made her stage debut in 1941. White went on to become an internationally known and respected performer.

An early introduction of the music often referred to as the fifties revolution came from Halifax musician and entertainer Eddy (M) Melanson. Eddy made his debut in 1953 performing for the Halifax Coloured Citizens Improvement League at the Odeon Theatre with a revised upbeat country sound. That sound was later classified by music historian Steve Fruitman as a reincarnation of the Country Jump Blues.Eddy formed his own band in the mid fifties and named it the ROCKABILLYS placing him at the beginning of that genre of music, introducing it in Nova Scotia. When Bill Haley and the Comets toured in the Maritimes in 1958 Eddy and his Rockabillys was selected as the Canadian group to open and close for them. He&#x27;s inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (#381) as an original Canadian Rockabilly.

In 1966 The Men of the Deeps, the coal miners of Cape Breton began, and tour all over North America to this day

===The 1970s and 1980s===
The pop and country sounds of the 1970s were exemplified by Springhill, Nova Scotia native Anne Murray and her Haligonian producer Brian Ahern. She had a series of top 10 hits worldwide starting with &quot;Snowbird&quot; in 1970, and continues to be a major concert performer. Anne Murray had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit with the country pop &quot;You Needed Me&quot; in 1978. Possibly the most famous rock band from the 1970s was progressive rockers April Wine, but other bands such as Pepper Tree, Dutch Mason, Matt Minglewood and Stan Crawford Band which became the JETZ enjoyed a great degree of national and international success.

As the music scene in Nova Scotia started to coalesce around Halifax and its emerging underground scene, new sounds and new styles of music started to be heard. Both the punk and new wave movements found fertile ground in Halifax, the latter producing a band whose lead singer, Sarah McLachlan, would be snapped up in the 1980s and moved to Vancouver, to later become a huge international star. Sarah McLachlan had 2 #2 albums on the Billboard 200 like the adult contemporary &quot;Surfacing&quot; in 1997.

It was toward the end of the 1980s that the music scene in Nova Scotia seemed to truly become an industry, with Nova Scotians leading the creation of the East Coast Music Awards as well as establishing the Music Industry Association of Nova Scotia. Performers as diverse as rock band Blackpool, hip hop artists MC G and Cool J, and Celtic pop darlings the Rankin Family all achieved national radio &amp; video play, major label record deals, and national media recognition.

===1990s and beyond===
This was followed by the Halifax music explosion of the 1990s, which saw bands such as Sloan, Eric&#x27;s Trip, Jale, Thrush Hermit and Newfoundland émigrés The Hardship Post obtain international recognition and recording deals with labels such as DGC and Sub Pop. It was during this time that the internationally known Halifax Pop Explosion music festival was founded (in 1993).

Though the initial excitement generated during this time has abated, Nova Scotia remains at the forefront of the internationally successful Canadian music wave, with artists who came out of that era, such as Joel Plaskett, and hip hop hero Buck 65 continuing to gain worldwide respect and attention. Other acts such as The Trews, The Stanfields, Matt Mays, and Jimmy Swift Band have all experienced considerable success nationally.

In the past decade, a number of independent record labels, have emerged to support the growth of the indie rock. Dependent Music publishes music by popular acts such as Wintersleep, Brian Borcherdt, Jill Barber, and Holy Fuck. BelowMeMusic promotes the Jimmy Swift Band, Slowcoaster, and Grand Theft Bus.

===Emergence of hip hop===

While historically isolated from the Toronto-centric Canadian hip hop scene, Nova Scotia has an increasing number of nationally known acts. In the 1980s, bands such as Down By Law, MC G and Cool J, and Hip Club Groove experienced degrees of national success.

In the 1990s and early 21st century, many artists have achieved national success. Buck 65, from Mount Uniacke, has released several well received records internationally. Sixtoo is signed to and released several records on Montreal label Ninjatune. Universal Soul have seen considerable national exposure since being nominated for two MuchMusic Video Awards in 2003. Classified is an MC and producer nominated for a 2004 CUMA. The Goods, with members Kunga 219 and Gordski, have successfully toured across North America. Kaleb Simmonds achieved a national reputation after a showing in the Top Ten on the first season of Canadian Idol. Scratch Bastid came in second in the 2004 Canadian DMC finals in Winnipeg and won the 2004 Scribble Jam in Cincinnati.

<text>Myrceugenia is a genus of evergreen woody flowering trees and shrubs belonging to the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, first described as a genus in 1855. The genus is native to South America from central Brazil to southern Chile. It is closely related to the genus &quot;Luma&quot;; some botanists include &quot;Myrceugenia&quot; in that genus.

&quot;Myrceugenia schulzei&quot; is endemic to Alejandro Selkirk Island in the Juan Fernández Islands, located in the Pacific Ocean west of the Chilean coast. &quot;Nothomyrcia fernandeziana&quot;, which is endemic to nearby Robinson Crusoe Island, was formerly placed in &quot;Myrceugenia&quot; but is now considered the sole species of genus &quot;Northomyrcia&quot;. Both are prominent trees in the lowland and lower montane forests of the islands.

<text>Strobilanthes is a genus of about 350 species of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, mostly native to tropical Asia and Madagascar, but with a few species extending north into temperate regions of Asia. Many species are cultivated for their two-lipped, hooded flowers in shades of blue, pink, white and purple. Most are frost-tender and require protection in frost-prone areas. The genus is most famed for its many (but not all) species which bloom on long cycles of several years, such as &quot;Strobilanthes wightii&quot; which blooms every thirteen years. 

==Species==

&quot;Strobilanthes atropurpurea&quot; is a temperate species, native to eastern Siberia; it is cultivated for its purple flowers.

&quot;Strobilanthes dyeriana&quot; (Persian shield) is a tropical plant native to Myanmar. It is grown for its dark green foliage with bright, metallic-purple stripes radiating outward from the central leaf vein. In proper conditions, it will also produce pale purple flowers. Persian Shield grows best outdoors in USDA zones 9 and 10, although it can survive in other zones as a houseplant given sufficient temperature, soil moisture and humidity. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>A cognitive radio (CR) is a radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically to use the best channels in its vicinity to avoid user interference and congestion. Such a radio automatically detects available channels, then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications in a given band at one location. This process is a form of dynamic spectrum management.

==Description==
In response to the operator&#x27;s commands, the cognitive engine is capable of configuring radio-system parameters. These parameters include &quot;waveform, protocol, operating frequency, and networking&quot;. This functions as an autonomous unit in the communications environment, exchanging information about the environment with the networks it accesses and other cognitive radios (CRs). A CR &quot;monitors its own performance continuously&quot;, in addition to &quot;reading the radio&#x27;s outputs&quot;; it then uses this information to &quot;determine the RF environment, channel conditions, link performance, etc.&quot;, and adjusts the &quot;radio&#x27;s settings to deliver the required quality of service subject to an appropriate combination of user requirements, operational limitations, and regulatory constraints&quot;.

Some &quot;smart radio&quot; proposals combine wireless mesh network—dynamically changing the path messages take between two given nodes using cooperative diversity; cognitive radio—dynamically changing the frequency band used by messages between two consecutive nodes on the path; and software-defined radio—dynamically changing the protocol used by message between two consecutive nodes.

==History==
The concept of cognitive radio was first proposed by Joseph Mitola III in a seminar at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1998 and published in an article by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. in 1999. It was a novel approach in wireless communications, which Mitola later described as:

The point in which wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the related networks are sufficiently computationally intelligent about radio resources and related computer-to-computer communications to detect user communications needs as a function of use context, and to provide radio resources and wireless services most appropriate to those needs.

Cognitive radio is considered as a goal towards which a software-defined radio platform should evolve: a fully reconfigurable wireless transceiver which automatically adapts its communication parameters to network and user demands.

Traditional regulatory structures have been built for an analog model and are not optimized for cognitive radio. Regulatory bodies in the world (including the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and Ofcom in the United Kingdom) as well as different independent measurement campaigns found that most radio frequency spectrum was inefficiently utilized. Cellular network bands are overloaded in most parts of the world, but other frequency bands (such as military, amateur radio and paging frequencies) are insufficiently utilized. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that spectrum utilization depends on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used, even when any unlicensed users would not cause noticeable interference to the assigned service. Regulatory bodies in the world have been considering whether to allow unlicensed users in licensed bands if they would not cause any interference to licensed users. These initiatives have focused cognitive-radio research on dynamic spectrum access.

The first cognitive radio wireless regional area network standard, IEEE 802.22, was developed by IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standard Committee (LMSC) and published in 2011. This standard uses geolocation and spectrum sensing for spectral awareness. Geolocation combines with a database of licensed transmitters in the area to identify available channels for use by the cognitive radio network. Spectrum sensing observes the spectrum and identifies occupied channels. IEEE 802.22 was designed to utilize the unused frequencies or fragments of time in a location. This white space is unused television channels in the geolocated areas. However, cognitive radio cannot occupy the same unused space all the time. As spectrum availability changes, the network adapts to prevent interference with licensed transmissions.

==Terminology==
Depending on transmission and reception parameters, there are two main types of cognitive radio:
* &quot;Full Cognitive Radio&quot; (Mitola radio), in which every possible parameter observable by a wireless node (or network) is considered.
* &quot;Spectrum-Sensing Cognitive Radio&quot;, in which only the radio-frequency spectrum is considered.

Other types are dependent on parts of the spectrum available for cognitive radio:
* &quot;Licensed-Band Cognitive Radio&quot;, capable of using bands assigned to licensed users (except for unlicensed bands, such as the U-NII band or the ISM band). The IEEE 802.22 working group is developing a standard for wireless regional area network (WRAN), which will operate on unused television channels, also known as TV white spaces.
* &quot;Unlicensed-Band Cognitive Radio&quot;, which can only utilize unlicensed parts of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. One such system is described in the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 2 specifications, which focus on the coexistence of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth.
* &quot;Spectrum mobility&quot;: Process by which a cognitive-radio user changes its frequency of operation. Cognitive-radio networks aim to use the spectrum in a dynamic manner by allowing radio terminals to operate in the best available frequency band, maintaining seamless communication requirements during transitions to better spectrum.
* &quot;Spectrum sharing&quot;: Spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks allow cognitive radio users to share the spectrum bands of the licensed-band users. However, the cognitive radio users have to restrict their transmit power so that the interference caused to the licensed-band users is kept below a certain threshold.
* &quot;Sensing-based Spectrum sharing&quot;: In sensing-based spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks, cognitive radio users first listen to the spectrum allocated to the licensed users to detect the state of the licensed users. Based on the detection results, cognitive radio users decide their transmission strategies. If the licensed users are not using the bands, cognitive radio users will transmit over those bands. If the licensed users are using the bands, cognitive radio users share the spectrum bands with the licensed users by restricting their transmit power.
* &quot;Database-enabled Spectrum Sharing&quot;,: In this modality of spectrum sharing, cognitive radio users are required to access a white space database prior to be allowed, or denied, access to the shared spectrum. The white space database contain algorithms, mathematical models and local regulations to predict the spectrum utilization in a geographical area and to infer on the risk of interference posed to incumbent services by a cognitive radio user accessing the shared spectrum. If the white space database judges that destructive interference to incumbents will happen, the cognitive radio user is denied access to the shared spectrum.

==Technology==
Although cognitive radio was initially thought of as a software-defined radio extension (full cognitive radio), most research work focuses on spectrum-sensing cognitive radio (particularly in the TV bands). The chief problem in spectrum-sensing cognitive radio is designing high-quality spectrum-sensing devices and algorithms for exchanging spectrum-sensing data between nodes. It has been shown that a simple energy detector cannot guarantee the accurate detection of signal presence, calling for more sophisticated spectrum sensing techniques and requiring information about spectrum sensing to be regularly exchanged between nodes. Increasing the number of cooperating sensing nodes decreases the probability of false detection.

Filling free RF bands adaptively, using OFDMA, is a possible approach. Timo A. Weiss and Friedrich K. Jondral of the University of Karlsruhe proposed a spectrum pooling system, in which free bands (sensed by nodes) were immediately filled by OFDMA subbands. Applications of spectrum-sensing cognitive radio include emergency-network and WLAN higher throughput and transmission-distance extensions. The evolution of cognitive radio toward cognitive networks is underway; the concept of cognitive networks is to intelligently organize a network of cognitive radios.

===Functions===
The main functions of cognitive radios are:

* &quot;Power Control&quot;: Power control is usually used for spectrum sharing CR systems to maximize the capacity of secondary users with interference power constraints to protect the primary users.
* &quot;Spectrum sensing&quot;: Detecting unused spectrum and sharing it, without harmful interference to other users; an important requirement of the cognitive-radio network is to sense empty spectrum. Detecting primary users is the most efficient way to detect empty spectrum. Spectrum-sensing techniques may be grouped into three categories:
**&quot;Transmitter detection&quot;: Cognitive radios must have the capability to determine if a signal from a primary transmitter is locally present in a certain spectrum. There are several proposed approaches to transmitter detection:
***Matched filter detection
*** Energy detection: Energy detection is a spectrum sensing method that detects the presence/absence of a signal just by measuring the received signal power. This signal detection approach is quite easy and convenient for practical implementation. To implement energy detector, however, noise variance information is required. It has been shown that an imperfect knowledge of the noise power (noise uncertainty) may lead to the phenomenon of the SNR wall, which is a SNR level below which the energy detector can not reliably detect any transmitted signal even increasing the observation time. It has also been shown that the SNR wall is not caused by the presence of a noise uncertainty itself, but by an insufficient refinement of the noise power estimation while the observation time increases. 
*** Cyclostationary-feature detection: These type of spectrum sensing algorithms are motivated because most man-made communication signals, such as BPSK, QPSK, AM, OFDM, etc. exhibit cyclostationary behavior. However, noise signals (typically white noise) do not exhibit cyclostationary behavior. These detectors are robust against noise variance uncertainty. The aim of such detectors is to exploit the cyclostationary nature of man-made communication signals buried in noise. Their main decision parameter is comparing the non zero values obtained by CSD of the primary signal. Cyclostationary detectors can be either single cycle or multicycle cyclostationary.
* &quot;Wideband spectrum sensing&quot;: refers to spectrum sensing over large spectral bandwidth, typically hundreds of MHz or even several GHz. Since current ADC technology cannot afford the high sampling rate with high resolution, it requires revolutional techniques, e.g., compressive sensing and sub-Nyquist sampling.
** &quot;Cooperative detection&quot;: Refers to spectrum-sensing methods where information from multiple cognitive-radio users is incorporated for primary-user detection
** &quot;Interference-based detection&quot;
*&quot;Null-space based CR&quot;: With the aid of multiple antennas, CR detects the null-space of the primary-user and then transmits within the null-space, such that its subsequent transmission causes less interference to the primary-user
* &quot;Spectrum management&quot;: Capturing the best available spectrum to meet user communication requirements, while not creating undue interference to other (primary) users. Cognitive radios should decide on the best spectrum band (of all bands available) to meet quality of service requirements; therefore, spectrum-management functions are required for cognitive radios. Spectrum-management functions are classified as:
** &quot;Spectrum analysis&quot;
** &quot;Spectrum decision&quot;
The practical implementation of spectrum-management functions is a complex and multifaceted issue, since it must address a variety of technical and legal requirements. An example of the former is choosing an appropriate sensing threshold to detect other users, while the latter is exemplified by the need to meet the rules and regulations set out for radio spectrum access in international (ITU radio regulations) and national (telecommunications law) legislation. Artificial Intelligence based algorithms algorithm for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference management in order to reduce harmful interference to other services and networks will be a key technology enabler towards 6G. This will pave the way for more flexibility in the management and regulation of the radioelectric spectrum.

===Intelligent antenna (IA)===
An intelligent antenna (or smart antenna) is an antenna technology that uses spatial beam-formation and spatial coding to cancel interference; however, applications are emerging for extension to intelligent multiple or cooperative-antenna arrays for application to complex communication environments. Cognitive radio, by comparison, allows user terminals to sense whether a portion of the spectrum is being used in order to share spectrum with neighbor users. The following table compares the two:
Note that both techniques can be combined as illustrated in many contemporary transmission scenarios.

Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO) combines both techniques.

==Applications==
Cognitive Radio (CR) can sense its environment and, without the intervention of the user, can adapt to the user&#x27;s communications needs while conforming to FCC rules in the United States. In theory, the amount of spectrum is infinite; practically, for propagation and other reasons it is finite because of the desirability of certain spectrum portions. Assigned spectrum is far from being fully utilized, and efficient spectrum use is a growing concern; CR offers a solution to this problem. A CR can intelligently detect whether any portion of the spectrum is in use, and can temporarily use it without interfering with the transmissions of other users. According to Bruce Fette, &quot;Some of the radio&#x27;s other cognitive abilities include determining its location, sensing spectrum use by neighboring devices, changing frequency, adjusting output power or even altering transmission parameters and characteristics. All of these capabilities, and others yet to be realized, will provide wireless spectrum users with the ability to adapt to real-time spectrum conditions, offering regulators, licenses and the general public flexible, efficient and comprehensive use of the spectrum&quot;.

Examples of applications include:
* The application of CR networks to emergency and public safety communications by utilizing white space
* The potential of CR networks for executing dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
* Application of CR networks to military action such as chemical biological radiological and nuclear attack detection and investigation, command control, obtaining information of battle damage evaluations, battlefield surveillance, intelligence assistance, and targeting.
*They are also proven to be helpful in establishing Medical Body Area Networks which can be utilized in omnipresent patient monitoring that aids in immediately notifying the doctors regarding vital information of patients such as sugar level, blood pressure, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram (ECG), etc. This gives the additional advantage of reducing the risk of infections and also increases the patient&#x27;s mobility.
* Cognitive radio is practical also to wireless sensor networks, where packet relaying can take place using primary and secondary queues to forward packets without delays and with minimum power consumption.

==Simulation of CR networks==
At present, modeling &amp; simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in a given environment&#x27;s cognitive radio networks. Network simulators like OPNET, NetSim, MATLAB and ns2 can be used to simulate a cognitive radio network. CogNS is an open-source NS2-based simulation framework for cognitive radio networks. Areas of research using network simulators include:

# Spectrum sensing &amp; incumbent detection
# Spectrum allocation
# Measurement and/or modeling of spectrum usage
# Efficiency of spectrum utilization
Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) is also a viable option for simulating CR. ns-3 can be also used to emulate and experiment CR networks with the aid from commodity hardware like Atheros WiFi devices.

==Future plans==
The success of the unlicensed band in accommodating a range of wireless devices and services has led the FCC to consider opening further bands for unlicensed use. In contrast, the licensed bands are underutilized due to static frequency allocation. Realizing that CR technology has the potential to exploit the inefficiently utilized licensed bands without causing interference to incumbent users, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making which would allow unlicensed radios to operate in the TV-broadcast bands. The IEEE 802.22 working group, formed in November 2004, is tasked with defining the air-interface standard for wireless regional area networks (based on CR sensing) for the operation of unlicensed devices in the spectrum allocated to TV service. To comply with later FCC regulations on unlicensed utilization of TV spectrum, the IEEE 802.22 has defined interfaces to the mandatory TV White Space Database in order to avoid interference to incumbent services. Although spectrum geolocation databases allow reducing the receiver complexity, and interference probability, for instance from sensing errors or hidden nodes, this comes at the cost of a lower spectrum utilization efficiency as the databases can not capture a fine-grained quantification of spectrum utilization and are not updated in real-time. Collaborative sensing, and distributed spectrum management based on artificial intelligence could contribute in the future towards a better balance between spectrum utilization efficiency and interference mitigation.

<doc id="1000684" wikidata="Q7143495" url="?curid=1000684" title="Pat Green">
<text>Patrick Craven Green (born April 5, 1972) is an American Texas Country artist. Active since 1995, he has recorded a total of seven studio albums, including three for Republic Records and two for BNA. Fifteen of his singles have charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs, of which the highest-peaking is &quot;Wave on Wave&quot; (No. 3) from his gold-certified album of the same name.

==Music career==
Green started his music career as an 18-year-old at Texas Tech University playing small gigs at bars and clubs around Lubbock. In 1995, Green independently recorded and released a series of albums produced by Lloyd Maines using money borrowed from his parents. Green did not commit fully to his music career until 1997 when his stepfather fired him from his job as a fuel wholesaler. Green had been counting his money from a weekend of singing and his stepfather knew he would need motivation to fully pursue music as a career.

After committing to music, Green drew the attention of Willie Nelson and joined a tour featuring Nelson and several other famous country musicians. Green&#x27;s appearance at the 1998 Willie Nelson July 4 Picnic was his first step towards nationwide recognition, and he was soon playing sold out shows in Texas. Green was sponsored by Miller Lite and sold more than 250,000 albums, even without signing a major label recording contract.

Green&#x27;s first major-label recorded album, &quot;Three Days&quot;, repackaged his best pre-major songs and new tracks with modern sound engineering. The album was released to acclaim in 2001. The adventurous, Beatles-influenced &quot;Wave on Wave&quot;, was released in 2003, with the title track reaching number 3 on the charts by the end of the year. The album featured pop flourishes and sound engineering that was incrementally more compressed than that of &quot;Three Days&quot; but dramatically more so than that of his independent releases. The Christian-tinged title track remains Green&#x27;s top career hit.

Green&#x27;s mid-2000s period aimed to capitalize on his &quot;Wave on Wave&quot; commercial achievement, written by Billy Joe Parton. He achieved some critical and popular success but was unable to match his prior success and earned a &quot;sellout&quot; label. In late 2004, &quot;Lucky Ones&quot; was Green&#x27;s 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label. Despite weak label support, the album peaked at number 6 on the U.S. Country charts. Green joined popular country music artists including Keith Urban, Gretchen Wilson, Dave Matthews Band, and Kenny Chesney on major tours. Green released his album &quot;Cannonball&quot; in 2006. CMT questioned the album as reaching for the &quot;uninspired pop sound of today’s Nashville,&quot; with songs &quot;starting to sound too much alike&quot; and &quot;crossing the line into Nashville pop&quot; and perhaps not &quot;honest and natural.&quot; Green acknowledged that he needed hits to sustain the career that he wanted. In 2008, Green released &quot;Let Me&quot;, as the first single from what would become his final label-released album, &quot;What I&#x27;m For&quot;. The single reached 12 on the country charts, giving Green his first Top 20 single since &quot;Feels Just Like It Should&quot; reached No. 13 in 2006. Initially, &quot;Country Star&quot; was released as the second single, but it was withdrawn shortly after the title track (&quot;What I&#x27;m For&quot;) began receiving airplay. &quot;Country Star&quot; peaked at 32, and &quot;What I&#x27;m For&quot; peaked at 28 on the country charts in July 2009. Green parted ways with BNA shortly afterward.

Washed out in 2011, Green announced his return to Texas and independent music. On September 2, 2014, Taste of Country premiered the official lyric video for a new song, &quot;Girls from Texas&quot;, featuring Lyle Lovett. On September 16, 2014, &quot;Girls from Texas&quot; was made available on iTunes. On May 18, 2015, Green released a new single, &quot;While I Was Away&quot;. The video, a tribute to long-distance parents, premiered on People.com on May 22. &quot;While I Was Away&quot; was inducted into Taste of Country&#x27;s Showdown Hall of Fame after winning five consecutive fan-voted rounds against artists including Blake Shelton, Dierks Bentley, Cassadee Pope, and David Nail.

Green&#x27;s self-released &quot;Home&quot; debuted on digital media on August 14, 2015, and entered on the Top Country Albums chart at No. 5. The album includes appearances from Lyle Lovett, Sheryl Crow, and more. The twelfth single from the album, &quot;Day One&quot; was released to Texas radio on May 2, 2016. Green self-released the single &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Days&quot; on May 26, 2017. On Green&#x27;s 46th birthday, April 5, 2018, &quot;Dancehall Dreamin&#x27;: A Tribute to Pat Green&quot; was released. The album features covers of ten Pat Green hits along with commentary about each song. On July 20, 2018, he released the single &quot;Friday&#x27;s Comin&#x27;&quot; worldwide.

On September 2, 2022, Green released his first album in seven years, &quot;Miles and Miles of You&quot;, produced by Dwight A. Baker.

==Personal life==
Green was born in San Antonio to Craven Earl Green and Patricia Burgess. He was raised in Waco, Texas, where he attended Vanguard College Preparatory School for grades 7–12. Green&#x27;s father was a former Air Force officer and stage actor who influenced his son&#x27;s love of music. His parents divorced when he was seven. His mother later remarried.

After high school, Green attended Texas Tech University where he was a member of FarmHouse fraternity.

Green is an ardent fan of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Texas Rangers. &quot;I Like Texas&quot;, a song from his 1995 self-released album, &quot;Dancehall Dreamer&quot;, has been adopted as the Rangers&#x27; victory song.

<doc id="1000685" wikidata="Q1595242" url="?curid=1000685" title="Car chase">
<text>A car chase or vehicle pursuit is the vehicular overland chase of one party by another, involving at least one automobile or other wheeled motor vehicle, commonly hot pursuit of suspects by law enforcement. The rise of the automotive industry in the 20th century increased car ownership, leading to a growing number of criminals attempting to evade police in their own vehicle or a stolen car. Car chases may also involve other parties in pursuit of a criminal suspect or intended victim, or simply in an attempt to make contact with a moving person for non-conflict reasons.

Car chases are often captured on news broadcast due to the video footage recorded by police cars, police aircraft, and news aircraft participating in the chase. Car chases are also a popular subject with media and audiences due to their intensity, drama and the innate danger of high-speed driving, and thus are common content in fiction, particularly action films and video games.

== Police involvement ==

Car chases occur when a suspect attempts to use a vehicle to escape from law enforcement attempting to detain or arrest them. The assumed offence committed may range from misdemeanors such as traffic infractions to felonies as serious as murder. When suspects realize they have been spotted by law enforcement, they attempt to lose their pursuer by driving away, usually at high speed. Generally, suspects who police spot committing crimes for which long prison terms are likely upon conviction are much more likely to start car chases.

Police use a number of techniques to end chases, from pleading with the driver, waiting for the driver&#x27;s vehicle to run out of fuel, or hoping the driver&#x27;s vehicle becomes somehow disabled to more forceful methods such as boxing in the vehicle with police cruisers, ramming the vehicle, the PIT maneuver, shooting out the tires, or the use of spike strips. Though all efforts, many of which pose risk to all involved as well as bystanders, will be aimed at avoiding danger to civilians. When available, police aircraft may be deployed, which may follow the vehicle from above while ground units may or may not be involved.

=== History ===
The use of automobiles to evade law enforcement has existed for about as long as the automobile itself; newspaper reports of police chases involving automobiles and motorcycles date back to the 1900s and 1910s. During Prohibition in the United States, bootleggers and moonshine runners often engaged in high-speed chases with police. This led to rise of car modifications intended to outrun the law and auto-racing exhibitions between runners which helped form the sport of stock car racing.

As police forces became more accustomed to chases, they began to adopt police protocol, techniques, and technologies intended to help pursuits more quickly and safely, such as the PIT maneuver in the 1980s and spike strips in the 1990s.

Since the 2010s, as the dangers of car chases become apparent, police have tested various alternative methods of tracking fleeing suspects without continuing to pursue them such as StarChase&#x27;s GPS trackers or the Grappler bullbar with a tire-catching net. Alternatively, some strategies have centered around simply not pursuing suspect vehicles and instead relying on using vehicle registration to identify the suspect and apprehend them later, though this is ineffective with stolen vehicles.

=== Media coverage ===
The earliest police chase known to be recorded on video in its entirety occurred in May 1988 in Berea, Ohio, when a police officer with a video camera mounted in his cruiser recorded the pursuit of a fleeing suspect vehicle, from the initial attempts to stop his car to his eventual arrest.

On January 3, 1992, a lengthy pursuit in Southern California, involving a Volkswagen Cabriolet stolen by a suspected murderer, Darren Michael Stroh, who was eventually killed by California Highway Patrol officers in a shootout, became the first police chase to be broadcast live on television, airing on three channels and preempting daytime programs on the station. The chase was reportedly so popular that, when one station switched to a rerun of &quot;Matlock&quot;, several viewers called in to complain and request they continue airing the chase. This convinced stations to show further live coverage of police pursuits.

In 2002, 700 pursuits were reported in the city of Los Angeles. In 2003, Los Angeles television station KCAL reported a quadrupling of ratings when police pursuits aired. That same year, the Los Angeles Police Department asked news media to reduce coverage of chases, claiming that coverage encourages suspects to flee and may potentially endanger viewers who attempt to view the chase in person.

Reality television has combined with the car chase genre in a number of television shows and specials such as &quot;World&#x27;s Wildest Police Videos&quot;, &quot;Most Shocking&quot;, and &quot;Real TV&quot; which often feature real footage of car chases involving suspects fleeing police. In addition, videos and livestreams of car chases are popular content on social media.

On June 17, 1994 former NFL running back O. J. Simpson gained notoriety following national coverage of a low speed chase in his white 1993 Ford Bronco after the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in Los Angeles.

One notable recorded police chase occurred when an M60 Patton tank was stolen by Shawn Nelson from an Army National Guard armory, on May 17, 1995. Nelson went on a rampage through San Diego, California, with the massive tank crushing multiple civilian vehicles before becoming stuck on a road divider. Police were able to mount the tank and open the hatch, killing the suspect when he would not surrender.

On June 4, 2004, welder Marvin Heemeyer went on a rampage in a heavily modified bulldozer in Granby, Colorado, wrecking 13 buildings including the town hall, the public library, a bank, a concrete batch plant, and a house owned by the town&#x27;s former mayor, resulting in over $7 million in damage. The police were initially powerless, as none of their weapons could penetrate the suspect&#x27;s vehicle. However, the bulldozer&#x27;s engine failed and the machine became stuck, so Heemeyer committed suicide by gunshot.

On July 27, 2007 in Phoenix, Arizona, two helicopters collided in mid air while filming a police pursuit. Both were AS-350 AStar news helicopters from the KNXV-TV and KTVK news stations. All four occupants of both aircraft were killed. No one on the ground was injured.

On September 28, 2012, Fox News aired a live police chase in Arizona which ended in the suspect exiting the vehicle and shooting himself after a short foot chase. Fox News was airing it in a five-second delay instead of a normal ten-second delay, which resulted in the shooting being aired on a live broadcast of the &quot;Fox Report&quot;. Fox anchorman Shepard Smith soon apologized for the broadcast and vowed to never let it happen again.

Live news coverage of police chases is widely associated with the United States and with the city of Los Angeles in particular, which is often described by journalists as &quot;the car chase capital of the world.&quot;

===Risks and legal considerations===

High-speed car chases are recognized as a road safety problem, as vehicles not involved in the pursuit, pedestrians or street furniture may be hit by the elusive driver, who will often violate a number of traffic laws, often repeatedly, in their attempt to escape, or by the pursuing police cars. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40 people a year are killed in road traffic incidents involving police, most as a result of a police pursuit. In the United States, chase-related deaths range between 300 and 400 people per year.

The February 2005 Macquarie Fields riots occurred in Sydney, Australia after a local driver crashed a stolen vehicle into a tree, killing his two passengers following a high-speed police pursuit. The death of university student Clea Rose following a police chase in Canberra sparked major recriminations over police pursuit policies.

In 2007, the United States Supreme Court held in &quot;Scott v. Harris&quot; (550 U.S. 372) that a &quot;police officer&#x27;s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.&quot;

In most common law jurisdictions, the fireman&#x27;s rule prevents police officers injured in such pursuits from filing civil lawsuits for monetary damages against the fleeing suspects, because such injuries are supposed to be an inherent risk of the job. Public outrage at such immunity has resulted in statutory exceptions. One example is California Civil Code Section 1714.9 (enacted 1982), which reinstates liability where the suspect knew or should have known that the police were present.

Policy on what circumstances justify a high-speed pursuit differ by jurisdiction. Some safety advocates want to restrict risky chases to violent felonies. Another option is to use technology to end or avoid the need for such chases. For example, vehicles can be tracked by aircraft or GPS tagging devices like StarChase, allowing police agencies to reliably intercept suspects using stationary blockades, lower-speed vehicles, or when the vehicle is parked.

A 2023 United States Department of Justice report recommends that police should only initiate a chase only if a violent crime has been committed and the suspect poses an imminent threat to commit another violent crime due to the dangers posed by high speed pursuits. The report also recommends policies that discourage or prohibit pursuits if the suspect is riding a motorcycle.

===Inter-jurisdictional pursuits and policy issues===
One particular hazard that is attendant to police pursuits is the problem of multiple law enforcement agencies becoming involved in a car chase that crosses municipal and jurisdictional boundaries. This is often complicated by radio communication incompatibility and policy differences in the various departments involved in a pursuit.

The city of Dallas, Texas was the first major city in the United States to adopt an &quot;Inter-Jurisdictional Pursuit Policy&quot; to address the problems inherent in car chases that involved more than one law enforcement agency. In August 1984, the Dallas Police Department&#x27;s Planning and Research Division, under the command of Captain Rick Stone, began crafting a policy that more than twenty (20) local law enforcement agencies could agree to abide by when car chases crossed their borders. The result was a model policy that became the standard for use by police departments around the United States.

In Europe, as many national borders no longer have border stations within the Schengen Area, car chases may sometimes cross national boundaries. States often have agreements in place where the police of one state can continue the chase across the national boundary.

== Non-police car chases ==

Some car chases may occur between vehicles that are not involved in law enforcement. These may be conducted by rival criminals, criminals attempting to catch intended victims, vigilantes, or as part of road rage. They may also occur for non-criminal reasons, such as the pursuing vehicle simply attempting to catch up to another vehicle. These car chases are rare and are almost always considered illegal due to the dangers of civilian vehicles, lacking any sort of warning device or authorization, pursuing each other at high speeds.

In 2021, actor Terrence J was pursued and shot at by a vehicle in an attempted robbery. In 2021, a carjacking victim in Chicago pursued a car thief, resulting in an eight-vehicle collision in which the stolen vehicle was destroyed.

== In film and television ==
In film and television, the term &quot;car chase&quot; refers to a chase scene involving two or more automobiles pursuing one another, which may or may not involve a police car. Feature-length films have been built entirely around car chases, often featuring high-powered exotic vehicles. They are depicted as fast moving scenes with action involving the speed of the vehicles involved, and the potential collisions and the debris resulting from the wreckage.

Staging car chase sequences often requires numerous takes and destruction of several vehicles (whether intentional or mishap). Therefore, it is common to use older vehicles that are 1–2 generations behind the current models on the market, since these can be second-hand acquisitions at low cost due to depreciation. Often for rare models such as the Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34) in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious (2009)&quot;, the more common Nissan Skyline 25GT&#x27;s (R34) were acquired and modified to look like the GT-R (R34), while in another case a dune buggy was fitted with a GT-R (R34) shell.

There are some exceptions wherein a high-profile vehicle is used, such as the &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Transporter&quot; franchises, usually because the vehicles used are &quot;star cars&quot; (i.e. used by the film&#x27;s protagonists and featured prominently). Vehicle manufacturers may also pay for product placement in a film production, such as serving as technical advisors and/or donating the vehicles to be used in filming.

=== History ===
Although car chases on film were staged as early as the motor vehicle itself — one of the earliest examples being &quot;Runaway Match&quot; directed by Alf Collins in 1903 — the consensus among historians and film critics is that the first modern car chase movie was 1968&#x27;s &quot;Bullitt&quot;. The 10-minute-long chase scene in &quot;Bullitt&quot; was far longer and far faster than what had gone before, and placed cameras to give perspectives from inside the cars. Previously, car chase scenes were often staged using the rear projection effect.

===Computer-generated imagery===
The use of computer-generated imagery for car chases has become popular since the 2000s and, although costly, eliminates any danger to the actors and removes the necessity of damaging or destroying functional vehicles, particularly those that are rare, expensive, valuable, or not allowed to be damaged in production (such as if the car is product placement).

However, some critics claim that CGI eliminates the realism of chase scenes or, when done poorly or too obviously, can be visually jarring and uncanny. Such criticism has affected recent Hollywood productions; &quot;Driven&quot;, for example, was panned for its heavy use of CGI in chase scenes. As such, some films like &quot;Ronin&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and &quot;Need For Speed&quot;, used live-action chases with minimal use of CGI, if at all. &quot;Furious 7&quot; used CGI for &quot;only 10%&quot; of its action sequences, mostly to erase production artifacts such as wires or add backgrounds, as stunt coordinator Spiro Razatos wanted to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to &quot;feel real&quot; and fulfill audience&#x27;s expectations so only 10 percent of the action sequences in the film were computer-generated, and even then, much of the CGI was employed simply to erase the wires and other contraptions that were used to film real cars and drivers or to add a background.

=== Notable examples ===
* The &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise of films and television series features numerous car chases between various parties, including but not limited to police and criminal organizations.
* &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (1974) features a 40-minute car chase scene with multiple crashes (some of them unplanned, real accidents) and a 30-foot-high, 128-feet-long airborne jump over crashed cars that block a road.
* Films such as &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Keystone Cops&quot;, W. C. Fields&#x27;s comedies, &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;, &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;The Gnome Mobile&quot;, &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, and &quot;Short Time&quot; feature car chases that are used for comedic purposes.
* &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot; include scenes of cars going the wrong way at high speed against moderately congested freeway traffic.
* &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; depicts a car chase with characters moving from one vehicle to another and fighting atop moving vehicles.
* A number of television series have been built around the popularity of car chases, such as &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, and &quot;Chase&quot;. Some reality television series, especially those following law enforcement, have also depicted car chases over the course of following police activities, such as &quot;Cops&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Wildest Police Videos&quot;, and &quot;Live PD&quot;.

== In video games ==
Many video games, often within the open world and racing genres, tend to contain, if not focus on, car chases of some sort, usually involving police. Many of these chases are often heavily stylized, with police often ramming or even shooting suspect vehicles, or deploying dedicated &quot;pursuit units&quot; in performance cars.

=== Notable examples ===
*Early examples included Bally Midway&#x27;s &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; (1983), featuring a James Bond-style weaponized vehicle; and Atari Games&#x27; &quot;APB&quot; (1987), where the player controlled a police car.
*&quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; (1988) and its sequels have the player assume the role of a police officer who must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits.
*The &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series is notable for its depiction of police pursuits, usually involving high-performance cars driven by both criminals and police.
*The &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series is especially famous for its depiction of car chases in both missions and its open world, with reckless pursuits by both criminals and police being possible in every game in the series.
*&quot;L.A. Noire&quot; (2011) features police pursuits in several of its cases and missions, though unlike &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, the player takes the role of the police.

<text>Jacksonville University (JU) is a private university in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. Located in the city&#x27;s Arlington district, the school was founded in 1934 as a two-year college and was known as Jacksonville Junior College until September 5, 1956, when it shifted focus to building four-year university degree programs and later graduated its first four-year degree candidates as Jacksonville University in June 1959.

It is a member of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). JU&#x27;s student body currently represents more than 40 U.S. states and approximately 45 countries around the world. As a Division I institution, it fields 18 varsity athletics teams, known as the JU Dolphins, as well as intramural sports and clubs. Among the top majors declared by JU students are aviation management, biology, nursing, business, and marine science.

==History==
The school was founded in 1934 by William J. Porter. Originally known as William J. Porter University, it began as a private two-year college. Since a permanent site had not yet been acquired, classes were held on the third floor auditorium of the First Baptist Church Educational Building in downtown Jacksonville. Sixty students were enrolled in Porter University&#x27;s first year of operation.

The school changed its name to Jacksonville Junior College in 1935. It relocated three times over the next fifteen years, including a period in the Florida Theatre building, but the influx of GI bill students following the end of World War II made it necessary for the school to find a permanent location. In 1947 the administration purchased land in Jacksonville&#x27;s Arlington neighborhood on which to establish the current campus. The first building was completed in 1950 and classes officially began. The same year the school received full accreditation as a two-year college from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).
In 1958 Jacksonville Junior College merged with the Jacksonville College of Music, and the name was changed to Jacksonville University. In 1959 the first four-year class of 100 students graduated, and in 1961 JU received full accreditation as a four-year school from SACS. The 1960s saw the university grow substantially as enrollment increased, dormitories were built, two new colleges were established and the Swisher Gymnasium was constructed. The first student dormitories (Williams, McGehee, Brest, Merrill and Grether Halls) opened for the fall semester of 1965 on the south part of campus for a combined total of $2.4 million. The sixth dormitory, Botts Hall, opened in 1968. In 1970 the Jacksonville University Dolphins men&#x27;s basketball team, under star center Artis Gilmore, went to the NCAA Division I Championship. However, the opening of the public University of North Florida in 1972 eroded JU&#x27;s enrollment, while the removal of public funding hurt the school financially. In the 1990s Jacksonville University reconfigured itself as primarily a liberal arts college and embarked on a substantial fundraising campaign, which provided for the construction of new buildings and a revision of the campus master plan. In 1997 a new cafeteria was constructed, a Visual Arts Annex opened, and the on-campus Villages Apartments finished construction and opened for students on the north part of campus. Merrill and Grether Hall were demolished in 2007 to make way for Oak Hall, a modern 500-bed dormitory, and a new parking garage.

George Hallam, in conjunction with Jacksonville University and its library staff, published an extensive history of the university titled &quot;Our Place in the Sun&quot;, which details the development and progress of the institution between its inception in 1934 through the spring of 1988. Other university publications which have chronicled JU history throughout the decades include the &quot;JU Navigator&quot;, the &quot;Riparian&quot;, and &quot;The Wave&quot; magazine.

==Academics==

Jacksonville University offers more than 100 majors, minors, and programs at the undergraduate level, as well as 23 master&#x27;s and doctorate degree programs, leading to the M.S., M.A., M.A.T., and Master of Business Administration, Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).

The university is divided into five colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Davis College of Business &amp; Technology, the College of Fine Arts &amp; Humanities, the College of Law, and the Brooks Rehabilitation College of Healthcare Sciences. Along with the five colleges, the university also consists of three institutes: the Marine Science Research Institute, the Public Policy Institute, and the STEAM Institute.

The College of Arts and Sciences offers a traditional liberal arts education and includes JU&#x27;s School of Education, Wilma&#x27;s Little People School, Science and Mathematics, Social Sciences, Humanities, and the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC). JU has the second-largest Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps program in the nation and the longest-running in Florida. Jacksonville is a military- and veteran-friendly town, and is home to three major military installations. It is also an approved Yellow Ribbon School and is home to the Jacksonville University Veterans and Military Resource Center (VMRC). University staff and administration includes many distinguished veterans from multiple branches of the U.S. military.

The College of Fine Arts &amp; Humanities, with its integrated Alexander Brest Museum and Gallery, offers dance, theatre, music, and visual arts. Graduate programs are available in choreography and visual arts.

The Davis College of Business &amp; Technology (DCOBT) received its AACSB accreditation in January 2010, and is the only private, AACSB-accredited business school in North Florida. DCOBT offers both MBA and EMBA degrees, along with undergraduate business degrees in accounting, aviation management, aviation management &amp; flight operations, business administration, business analytics, business information systems, economics, finance, international business, management, marketing, and sport business. In both 2017 and 2018, the school&#x27;s CFA Research Challenge team won the CFA Institute Research Challenge in Florida, beating out schools such as University of Miami and University of Florida, and went on to compete nationally. In 2018 they won the national competition and competed as finalists in the global CFA Institute Research Challenge in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Jacksonville University has also teamed up with the Florida Coastal School of Law to offer a joint MBA/law degree, and joined forces with Aerosim Flight Academy to provide professional flight training to students of its ever-popular aviation major.

The inaugural class of Jacksonville University College of Law occurred in August 2022 with fourteen students. Twenty-six students joined the next year. Provisional accreditation was granted to the school by the American Bar Association during that organization&#x27;s February 22–23, 2024 meeting.

The JU Flight Team competes in National Intercollegiate Flying Association Regional and National Safety and Flight Evaluation Conference (SAFECON) against other universities, with its best team performance in 2007. The program is the third largest in the nation, behind Spartan School in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach. The team placed 10th in the nation at the National Intercollegiate Flying Association. In 2008, the team was awarded the Loening Trophy, which is given to the best collegiate aviation program in the country each year. It is currently on display in the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.

The Brooks Rehabilitation College of Healthcare Sciences (BRCHS), includes the School of Orthodontics and one of JU&#x27;s many premier learning environments, the Simulation Training and Applied Research (STAR) Center where students can participate in simulations of everything from childbirth to wound care.

The university&#x27;s BRCHS program offers Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and a Master of Science in Nursing degree, among many other degree programs and certifications. In 2014, Jacksonville University partnered with Brooks Rehabilitation Hospital to create the Brooks Rehabilitation Speech-Language Pathology program. BRCHS is affiliated with hundreds of local healthcare partners, including Nemours Children&#x27;s Clinic, Baptist Health Systems, Shands, St. Vincent&#x27;s Healthcare, Florida Blue, Duval County Public Schools, and Wolfson Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In 2012, the university established the Public Policy Institute (PPI), offering the only Master in Public Policy (MPP) degree program in the state of Florida. The institute also offers dual degree programs in conjunction with the Davis College of Business and hosts a variety of politically related events, including televised debates for local and regional elections, a radio program titled &quot;Policy Matters&quot;, and internship opportunities with local companies, local government and the Office of the Governor.

On February 28, 2022, Jacksonville University announced that with the assistance of a Jacksonville municipal grant, it was starting a law school. The announcement was made by Jacksonville University President Tim Cost and Mayor Lenny Curry. The location will be in the VyStar Building downtown where Jacksonville University already has a facility for working students. The law school opened in August 2022 with an initial enrollment of 14 students, the first new law school to open in the U.S. since 2014.

In November 2022, the university announced that it had partnered with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine to open a branch of the medical school at the Arlington Campus by 2026.

=== Rankings ===
Jacksonville University was ranked #34 (tie) in the Regional Universities South category of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s Best Colleges ranking in 2022–23.

==Athletics==

The JU athletic programs participate in NCAA Division I in the ASUN Conference, with the exception of the rowing program, which competes in the MAAC Conference (NCAA Division I).

Terry Alexander, the most successful coach in Jacksonville&#x27;s baseball history with 631 wins, entered his 31st year at Jacksonville and his 20th year as the program&#x27;s head coach. He has led the program to nine NCAA regional appearances, won six conference championships (1995, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009) and has completed five 40-win seasons. He has also coached 10 All-America honorees, 50 all-conference selections and helped 44 players get drafted by Major League Baseball organizations.

The basketball program has produced professional basketball players such as Artis Gilmore, Otis Smith, Pembrook Burrows III and Rex Morgan. In 1970, Jacksonville University became the second smallest school (behind St. Bonaventure) to make it to the NCAA Final Four and the national championship game. The team was led by head coach Joe Williams. After defeating the St. Bonaventure team in the tournament semi-finals, the Dolphins lost to the UCLA Bruins in the national championship. The following season, Jacksonville became the first college basketball team to average 100+ points per game, at a time when there was no three-point shot and no shot clock in college basketball. In 2009, Jacksonville won the regular season Atlantic Sun Conference title in men&#x27;s basketball, but fell to East Tennessee State in the conference tournament title game. The Dolphins were invited to the National Invitation Tournament, the school&#x27;s first post-season tournament since 1986, but lost in the first round to the University of Florida Gators.

The football program began play in 1998, winning its first Pioneer League title in 2008. The Dolphins competed in the Football Championship Series (FCS), where they won two division titles and two conference championships. The university discontinued its football program at the conclusion of the 2019 season.

JU is noted for its rowing program after taking the overall FIRA Cup (Florida Intercollegiate Rowing Association) in 2007 and again in 2014. The women&#x27;s rowing team won their first MAAC Championship in 2014 and won an automatic bid to the NCAA Div I National Championship (JU Website). Recently, JU has expanded its rowing program with the addition of the Negaard Rowing Center. The JU rowing program has had over 50 years of success around the world and has competed in locations such as the Nile River and England&#x27;s Henley Royal Regatta.

In 2016 Jacksonville University landed a pair of lacrosse icons to lead its men&#x27;s lacrosse program as Providence College assistant coach John Galloway was named head coach. One of the young legends in the sport, he was at Providence for four years after spending one year as a volunteer assistant at Duke. He brought along one of the game&#x27;s most famous players, Casey Powell, as his offensive coordinator.

==Student life==

The school&#x27;s Greek system includes fraternities and sororities. While Greeks do offer some social events, many residence halls also host their own events.

There are a variety of campus ministries on campus. In 2011, the Campus to City Wesley Foundation started meeting at JU.

Campus media organizations include the student newspaper (&quot;The Navigator&quot;), campus radio station (JU108), literary and arts magazine (&quot;The Aquarian&quot;), student-run broadcasting station (Dolphin Channel), and yearbook (&quot;The Riparian),&quot; which stopped its publication in 2010.

==Library==

The Carl S. Swisher Library spans over 52,000 square feet and three floors. It offers scenic views of the St. Johns River and is situated in the academic center of campus. This building was funded by a former JU Board of Trustees chair, Carl S. Swisher, who contributed the necessary funds for its construction. The library was built in three phases, with the first phase completed in 1953, the second phase in 1961, and the third phase in 1971. In 1966, then-President of the University, Dr. Robert H. Spiro, established the “Friends of the Library.&quot; The library has completed several renovations over the years, the most recent being completed in early 2023.

Today, the Carl S. Swisher Library holds more than 350,000 volumes of books, periodicals, music scores, and other items, as well as a substantial collection of digital resources. The library provides services in support of the university&#x27;s objectives, including research assistance, instruction sessions, and interlibrary loan services.

In partnership with the university&#x27;s College of Law and Center for Gender + Sexuality, in March 2023 the Swisher Library became home to the American Bar Association&#x27;s 19th Amendment exhibit.

<doc id="1000710" wikidata="Q699411" url="?curid=1000710" title="Battle of the Barents Sea">
<text>The Battle of the Barents Sea was a World War II naval engagement on 31 December 1942 between warships of the German Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) and British ships escorting Convoy JW 51B to Kola Inlet in the USSR. The action took place in the Barents Sea north of North Cape, Norway. The German raiders&#x27; failure to inflict significant losses on the convoy infuriated Hitler, who ordered that German naval strategy would henceforth concentrate on the U-boat fleet rather than surface ships.

==Background==
===Convoy JW 51B===
Convoy JW 51B comprised fourteen merchant ships carrying war materials to the USSR, about 202 tanks, 2,046 vehicles, 87 fighters, 33 bombers, of fuel, of aviation fuel and just over of other supplies. They were protected by the destroyers , , , , and , with the s and , the minesweeper and trawlers and . The escort commander was Captain Robert Sherbrooke (in &quot;Onslow&quot;). The convoy sailed in the dead of winter to preclude attacks by German aircraft like those that had devastated Convoy PQ 17. Force R (Rear-Admiral Robert L. Burnett), with the cruisers and and two destroyers, were independently stationed in the Barents Sea to provide distant cover.

===Operation Regenbogen===

On 31 December, a German force, based along Altafjord in northern Norway, under the command of Vice-Admiral Oskar Kummetz, began (Operation Rainbow). After Convoy PQ 18, the force had waited to attack the next Arctic convoy but their temporary suspension by the British during Operation Torch in the Mediterranean and Operation FB, the routing of single ships to Russia, had provided no opportunity to begin the operation. The force comprised the heavy cruisers , , and the destroyers , , , , and .

==Prelude==
Convoy JW 51B sailed from Loch Ewe on 22 December 1942 and met its escort off Iceland on 25 December. From there the ships sailed north-east, meeting severe gales on 28–29 December that caused ships of the convoy to lose station. When the weather moderated, five merchantmen and the escorts &quot;Oribi&quot; and &quot;Vizalma&quot; were missing and &quot;Bramble&quot; was detached to search for them. Three of the stragglers rejoined the following day and the other ships proceeded independently towards Kola Inlet. On 24 December the convoy was sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft and from 30 December was shadowed by ( Karl-Heinz Herbschleb). When the report was received by the German Naval Staff, Kummetz was ordered to sail immediately to intercept the convoy. Kummetz split his force into two divisions, led by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and &quot;Lützow&quot;, respectively.

==Battle==
At 08:00 on 31 December, the main body of Convoy JW 51B, twelve ships and eight warships, were some north of the coast of Finnmark heading east. Detached from the convoy were the destroyer &quot;Oribi&quot; and one ship, which took no part in the action; astern (north-east) of the convoy &quot;Bramble&quot; was searching for the stragglers. To the north of the convoy, about off, was &quot;Vizalma&quot; and another ship, while Burnett&#x27;s cruisers were to the south-east, from the convoy. To the east, away, the home-bound Convoy RA 51 was heading west. To the north of the convoy, &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and three destroyers were closing and away &quot;Lützow&quot; and her three destroyers were closing from the south. At 08:00 the destroyer &quot;Friedrich Eckholdt&quot; sighted the convoy and reported it to &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;.

At 08:20 on 31 December, &quot;Obdurate&quot;, stationed south of the convoy, spotted three German destroyers to the rear (west) of the convoy. Then, &quot;Onslow&quot; spotted &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, also to the rear of the convoy and steered to intercept with &quot;Orwell&quot;, &quot;Obedient&quot; and &quot;Obdurate&quot;. &quot;Achates&quot; was ordered to stay with the convoy and make smoke. After some firing, the British ships turned, apparently to make a torpedo attack. Considerably outgunned, Sherbrooke knew that his torpedoes were his most formidable weapons; the attack was a feint as once the torpedoes had been launched their threat would be gone. The ruse worked, &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; temporarily retired, since Kummetz had been ordered not to risk his ships. &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; returned to make a second attack, hitting &quot;Onslow&quot; causing severe damage and many casualties including 17 killed. &quot;Onslow&quot; survived the damage but Sherbrooke had been badly injured by a large steel splinter and command passed to the captain of &quot;Obedient&quot;.

&quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; then pulled north of the convoy, stumbled across &quot;Bramble&quot;, a , &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; returned fire with her much heavier guns causing a large explosion on &quot;Bramble&quot;. The destroyer &quot;Friedrich Eckholdt&quot; was ordered to finish off &quot;Bramble&quot;, which sank with all hands, while &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; shifted aim to &quot;Obedient&quot; and &quot;Achates&quot; to the south. &quot;Achates&quot; was badly damaged but continued to make smoke until eventually she sank, the trawler &quot;Northern Gem&quot; rescuing many of the crew. The Germans reported sinking a destroyer but this was a mistaken identification of &quot;Bramble&quot;; they had not realised &quot;Achates&quot; had been hit.

The shellfire attracted the attention of Force R, which was still further north. &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot; approached unseen and opened fire on &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; at 11:35, hitting her with enough six-inch shells to damage (and cause minor flooding to) two of her boiler rooms, reducing her speed to . Kummetz initially thought that the attack of the two cruisers was coming from another destroyer but upon realising his mistake, he ordered his ships to retreat to the west. In another case of mistaken identity, &quot;Friedrich Eckholdt&quot; and &quot;Richard Beitzen&quot; mistook &quot;Sheffield&quot; for &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and after attempting to formate with the British ships, &quot;Sheffield&quot; opened fire, &quot;Friedrich Eckholdt&quot; broke in two and sank with all hands.

&quot;Lützow&quot; approached from the east and fired ineffectively at the convoy, still hidden by smoke laid by &quot;Achates&quot;. Heading north-west to join &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, &quot;Lützow&quot; also encountered &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot;, which opened fire. Coincidentally, both sides decided to break off the action at the same time, each side fearing imminent torpedo attacks by destroyers upon their cruisers. This was shortly after noon; Burnett with Force R shadowed the German ships at a distance until it was evident that they were retiring to their base, the ships of the convoy re-formed and continued towards Kola Inlet.

==Aftermath==
The encounter took place in the middle of the months-long polar night and the German and British forces were scattered and unsure of the positions of the rest of their forces or those of their opponent. The battle became a confused affair and sometimes it was not clear who was firing on whom or how many ships were engaged. Despite the German efforts, all 14 of the merchant ships reached their destinations in the USSR undamaged.

Hitler was infuriated at what he regarded as the uselessness of the surface raiders, seeing that the initial attack of the two heavy cruisers was held back by destroyers before the arrival of the two British light cruisers. This failure nearly made Hitler enforce a decision to scrap the surface fleet and order the German Navy to concentrate on U-boat warfare. Admiral Erich Raeder, commander in chief of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, offered his resignation, which Hitler accepted. Raeder was replaced by Admiral Karl Dönitz, the commander of the U-boat fleet.

Dönitz saved the German surface fleet, although &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and the light cruisers and were laid up until late 1944; repairs and rebuilding of the battleship were abandoned. Work to complete the aircraft carrier , was suspended for the second and final time. German E-boats continued to operate off the coast of France but only one big surface operation was executed after the battle, the attempted raid on Convoy JW 55B by the battleship . The battleship was sunk by a British force in what became known as the Battle of the North Cape.

==Victoria Cross==
Captain Robert Sherbrooke was awarded the Victoria Cross. He acknowledged that it had really been awarded in honour of the whole crew of &quot;Onslow&quot;. In the action he had been badly wounded and he lost the sight in his left eye. He returned to operations and retired from the navy in the 1950s with the rank of rear-admiral.

==Commemoration==
At the memorial for &quot;Bramble&quot;, Captain Harvey Crombie said of the crew

The battle was the subject of the book &quot;73 North&quot; by Dudley Pope and the poem &quot;JW51B: A Convoy&quot; by Alan Ross, who served on &quot;Onslow&quot;.

<doc id="1000718" wikidata="Q7442146" url="?curid=1000718" title="Seattle Opera">
<text>Seattle Opera is an American opera company based in Seattle, Washington. The company&#x27;s season runs from August through late May, comprising five or six operas of eight to ten performances each, often featuring double casts in major roles to allow for successive evening presentations. 

Since August 2003, Seattle Opera has performed at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall (capacity: 2,967), which was built on the site of the old Seattle Opera House at Seattle Center. The company&#x27;s current general director is James Robinson. 

==History==
Glynn Ross founded the company in 1963, and served as its first general director until 1983. From the outset, Ross saw opera as something that had to be sold using similar techniques to those used to sell popular entertainment:

: &quot;To sell opera…you have to get their attention with a little razzle-dazzle. You&#x27;ve got to be simpatico. You have to be able to communicate, and you have to deliver your message with the best possible product you can manage.&quot; 

In 1970, H. C. Schonberg of the &quot;New York Times&quot; contrasted Seattle Opera&#x27;s approach to marketing to the then-still staid marketing of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera: 

: &quot;Out there, you see campaign buttons with the legend &quot;Opera Lives&quot;. It is in Seattle where you can look at the sky and find an airplane skywriting the virtues of Seattle Opera. There are even auto bumper stickers about opera.&quot; 

Further, Schonberg remarked favorably on the &quot;air of freshness and experimentation that contrasts vividly with the dull, tried and true, tired professionalism in other opera houses one could mention.&quot;

The company named Speight Jenkins as its next general director in December 1982, an unusual appointment in that Jenkins did not have prior administrative experience with arts organisations prior to his appointment. Jenkins formally took up the post with the 1983-1984 season, during which the company ran its first-ever fiscal deficit. Early in his tenure, Jenkins stated a goal of producing all ten of the major Wagner works in Seattle. This project began with &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in 1984, which was the first Seattle Opera production with supertitles. The project culminated with the August 2003 production of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, the first company production in its new venue, Marion Oliver McCaw Hall. Jenkins concluded his tenure as general director of Seattle Opera in 2014.

Aidan Lang became general director of the company as of the 2014-2015 season. His tenure included productions of contemporary operas such as &quot;As One&quot; (Laura Kaminsky) &quot;An American Dream&quot; (Jack Perla). Lang stood down as general director of the company at the close of the 2018-2019 season.

In March 2019, the company announced the appointment of Christina Scheppelmann as its next general director, the first woman to be named to the post, effective with the 2019-2020 season. Her tenure at Seattle Opera overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, and her work at Seattle Opera included presentation of a filmed virtual season of productions. In June 2023, Seattle Opera announced the scheduled conclusion of Scheppelmann&#x27;s tenure as general director at the close of the 2023-2024 season.

In August 2024, the company announced the appointment of James Robinson as its next general director and artistic director, effective 4 September 2024, with an initial contract of five seasons. His previous work at Seattle Opera included a 2004 production of &quot;Carmen&quot; that was the largest ticket-seller in the company&#x27;s history.

Seattle Opera currently does not have a full-time music director. In October 2007, the company announced the appointment of Asher Fisch as its principal guest conductor.

===Richard Wagner at Seattle Opera===
For many years, the company was noted for its performances of the works of Richard Wagner, including the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. In 1975, it was the first American company to perform the cycle in its entirety over the space of a week since the Metropolitan Opera in 1939. The Seattle Opera&#x27;s last &quot;Ring&quot; was in August 2013, and they have stated that they have no plans to produce the &quot;Ring&quot; in the future.

====&quot;Ring 1,&quot; 1975–1984====
Beginning with a production of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; one year, and following successively each year with &quot;Siegfried&quot; and, finally, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, Ross announced in 1975 that &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; would precede the others to make up the first consecutive Ring Cycle over six days in July. In spite of the modernization of the opera productions which Ross found at the Bayreuth Festival, Seattle&#x27;s were to be traditional productions and appeal to the lovers of the traditional.
Two back-to-back cycles of the &quot;Ring&quot;, one each in German and English, were presented annually between 1975 and 1983. Andrew Porter&#x27;s English adaptation which was prepared for the English National Opera and which was priced below the German language cycle, introduced many new listeners to Wagner. Originally directed by George London with designer John Naccarato, later presentations were directed by Lincoln Clark between 1976 and 1983, and by the tenor, Ragnar Ulfung in 1984. Henry Holt conducted all the cycles. The performances were well attended and received good press.

By 1982, the cycle was drawing opera lovers from all over the United States, as well as many other countries of the world, and Seattle appeared to be a serious rival to Bayreuth.

====&quot;Ring 2,&quot; 1985–1995====
Following his appointment as general director, Jenkins immediately set about creating a new &quot;Ring&quot; production. &quot;Die Walküre&quot; appeared first, in 1985, followed by complete cycles in 1986, 1987, 1991, and 1995. (Jenkins determined that the company could achieve higher quality performances by presenting the &quot;Ring&quot; every four years.) The new production was directed by Francois Rochaix, with sets and costumes designed by Robert Israel, lighting designed by Joan Sullivan, and supertitles (the first ever created for the &quot;Ring&quot;) by Sonya Friedman. The production set the action in a world of nineteenth-century theatricality. Initially controversial, it sold out in 1995. Conductors included Armin Jordan (&quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1985), Manuel Rosenthal (1986), and Hermann Michael (1987, 1991, and 1995).

====&quot;Ring 3,&quot; 2000–2013====
Jenkins engaged a new creative team to conceive Seattle Opera&#x27;s third &quot;Ring&quot; production, which was unveiled in 2000 (&quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;) and 2001 (full cycle) and returned in 2005, 2009, and 2013. Director Stephen Wadsworth, Set Designer Thomas Lynch, Costume Designer Martin Pakledinaz, Lighting Designer Peter Kaczorowski created a production which became known as the &quot;Green&quot; &quot;Ring&quot;, inspired in part by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Armin Jordan returned to conduct in 2000, Franz Vote in 2001, and Robert Spano in 2005 and 2009. The 2013 production, conducted by Asher Fisch, was released as a commercial recording on compact disc and on iTunes. The productions starred singers such as Greer Grimsley, Stephanie Blythe, Ewa Podles, Jane Eaglen, Richard Paul Fink, Margaret Jane Wray, and Stephen Milling.

It is best known for its numerous Catholic institutions, including schools, religious communities, shrines, institutes, and other organizations built and based around the Catholic University of America.

Historically centered along 12th Street NE, Brookland is bounded by Taylor Street NE and Michigan Avenue NE to the northwest; by Rhode Island Avenue NE to the southeast; by South Dakota Avenue NE to the northeast; and by subway (Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line) and train (CSX) tracks to the west. 

The western boundary of the railroad tracks originated with the completion of the former Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1873, which now incorporates the Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line. Brookland’s boundaries stretches to the National Shrine and includes Catholic University.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) provides public transportation services to and throughout Brookland, with two subway stations and several bus lines. Most of the Brookland neighborhood is served by the Washington Metropolitan Area Red Line Brookland–CUA Metro station, located between Monroe Street NE and Michigan Avenue NE. A small portion of the Brookland neighborhood located on Rhode Island Avenue NE is served by the Red Line Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station.

== History ==
In 1632 the English Crown unilaterally took the land from the Piscataway Natives who inhabited the Potomac-Anacostia region. King Charles I of England in turn granted the land, which was to become the state of Maryland, to George Calvert, whose interest in the colony lay in &quot;the sacred duty of finding a refuge for his Roman Catholic brethren.&quot; It took until about 1675 for English settlers to reach what is now the DC area, after defeating the Powhatans that reduced the Native American numbers by roughly 90 percent. 

Colonel Jehiel Brooks married into the land when he married Ann Margaret Queen, daughter of Nicholas Queen, and they received a 150-acre estate. In 1722, the Queen family raised a Roman Catholic Church, which morphed into St. Francis de Sales Parish in 1908.

For most of the 19th century, the area was farmland owned by the prominent Middleton and Queen families. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad later connected this portion of Washington County to downtown. Bellair, the 1840 brick Greek Revival mansion built by Colonel Jehiel Brooks, still stands. It is referred to as Brooks Mansion. It is the site of offices and production facilities for the Public Access Corporation of the District of Columbia, the city&#x27;s Government-access television (GAVT) channel known as DCTV.

Change came rapidly during and after the American Civil War. First, Fort Slemmer and Fort Bunker Hill were constructed as defenses against the Confederate Army, and later the Old Soldiers&#x27; Home was constructed to the northwest. The population of the city itself increased with the expansion of the federal government, and the former Brooks family estate became a housing tract named &quot;Brookland&quot;.

Growth continued throughout the 1870s when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad opened its Western Branch Line in the developing Brookland neighborhood. With the construction of nearby Sherwood, University Heights, and other tracts and with the expansion of Washington&#x27;s streetcar system, a middle-class streetcar suburb developed. Eventually its expansion southward met Washington&#x27;s northward expansion. Many Queen Anne style and other Victorian homes still stand.

The transition from a country estate towards a residential development beginning in 1887 &quot;marked the extension of suburban growth into the rather isolated reaches of the northeastern sector&quot; of D.C. In its early days, the Brookland community was marked by &quot;spacious lots and single family homes&quot;, which appealed to middle-class families and provided a &quot;small town atmosphere&quot;.

== Catholic institutions ==

Brookland, together with its surrounding neighborhoods, has been at times referred to as Little Rome and Little Vatican because of the many Catholic organizations and institutions clustered around the Catholic University of America. The university itself does not lie within Brookland&#x27;s borders, but since the Catholic Church purchased the Middletown estate adjacent to Brookland in 1887, many Catholic groups have established themselves there and in the neighboring communities of Edgewood and Michigan Park. Ordered by year of establishment, major Catholic organizations that are physically located in Brookland include:

* Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America (1899) and St. Francis Hall (1931)
* Holy Name College (1931–1984)
* Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration Convent (1954–2017), Sisters of Life Convent (2017–present)
* Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA (1986)

From 1984 until 2015, the Franciscans’ Holy Name College had served as the Howard University School of Divinity&#x27;s East Campus. As a divinity school, the institution did not solely focus on Christianity. Rather, it sought to educate students in scripture and theology generally, and to prepare them to be academics or to be ordained to serve as clergy. In 2016, the Urban Land Institute studied the site and engaged community stakeholders to determine potential development that might take place at the location. As of 2017, the site is scheduled to be redeveloped into a living-learning campus with current historic structures and open space preserved.

== Community diversity ==


Brookland integrated in the 20th century, especially after white flight took place following World War II and the US Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that restrictive covenants were unenforceable . Although there was some hostility directed at early black integration of the neighborhood, by the 1970s Brookland had developed into a neighborhood fairly integrated among economic classes and races.

During the mid-twentieth century, Brookland could boast of such prominent residents as Ralph Bunche, Sterling Allen Brown, Edward Brooke, Ellis O. Knox, Rayford W. Logan, Pearl Bailey, John P. Davis, Marvin Gaye, Paul Tsongas, Lucy Diggs Slowe, Lois Mailou Jones, and Robert C. Weaver. It remains a relatively diverse and stable area of Washington. African American architect Romulus C. Archer designed homes, buildings, and churches in the area.

Brookland was also home to the playwright Jean Kerr and her playwright/critic husband Walter Kerr, who taught at nearby Catholic University of America. The writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings spent her childhood in Brookland.

Justine Ward, the music educator and author, lived in Brookland and built the large residence now occupied by the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matara in the 1300 block of Quincy Street. The Department of Music at Catholic University is housed in a building named in Ward&#x27;s honor. Also on Quincy Street is the Quincy House, a long-time residence of Catholic graduate students who regularly host coffee houses and other community events.

==Development==
In November 2011, D.C. based real estate developer Abdo broke ground on a large mixed-use development. The project, known as Monroe Street Market, was fully completed in 2014. This area includes 27 artists&#x27; studios on an &quot;Arts Walk,&quot;. and commercial businesses and restaurants. While there are new projects slated for 2017/2018, at least part of the community believes the area is being overly developed, which has led to a few court battles with developers. A nearly-full-block parcel on Monroe Street between 9th and 10th Streets remains vacant at this time because of conflicts between neighbors and developers over the height of the planned mixed-use complex, meant to include over 200 apartments.

<doc id="1000737" wikidata="Q489286" url="?curid=1000737" title="Peter Chung">
<text>Peter Chung (born April 19, 1961) is an American animator and director. He is best known for his unique style of animation, as well as for being the creator and director of &quot;Æon Flux&quot; and for his character design for &quot;&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Peter Chung was born on April 19, 1961. Since his father was in the foreign service of the Republic of Korea, he has lived in Seoul, London, Nairobi, Washington, D.C., New York and Tunis. His parents then immigrated to the United States; he lived in McLean, Virginia. Chung studied animation at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) from 1979 to 1981, one year at the Character Animation program, and another year in the program in Experimental Animation.

Chung started his animation career at a small animation studio in Maryland at age 18, working for animator and illustrator Salvador Bru. From there at age 19 he was designing characters for Hanna-Barbera. About this time he also started working on the layout and animation on Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; before being hired by Disney for feature development.

===Directing credits===
In addition to &quot;Æon Flux&quot; (3 seasons: 1991, 1992, 1995), Chung&#x27;s directing credits include the &quot;Matriculated&quot; segment from &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury&quot;. Chung served as lead character designer for the animated series, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1987), &quot;C.O.P.S.&quot; (1988) &quot;Phantom 2040&quot; (1994–1996) and &quot;Reign: The Conqueror&quot; (1999). The designs feature lean angular characters inspired by the art of Egon Schiele, a look which has become Chung&#x27;s trademark character design. He also, along with Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, co-designed the characters in the Nickelodeon series &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and co-directed its pilot, &quot;Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing&quot; and the opening sequence. In addition, in 2007 he directed the opening three-part episode for GameTaps&#x27; &quot;&quot;, entitled &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;.

He has also directed some television advertisements – available at Peter Chung at Acme Filmworks – including a Diet Pepsi advertisement featuring Cindy Crawford and Malcolm McDowell.

, among other unannounced projects, he was working on a full-length animated feature entitled &quot;Luvula&quot;. He is also director of the television adaption of &quot;Firebreather&quot; for Cartoon Network. Chung has also expressed interest in creating a new direct-to-video animated feature of &quot;Æon Flux&quot;.

===Animation style and influences===
Chung names Japanese animation, German expressionism and European comics as his influence, in particular the illustrative quality of the art that depends on expressive drawings instead of many surface details. He names in his influences expressionist Egon Schiele and comic artist Moebius. As narrative influence he names Kazuo Umezu, Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Jack Kirby, Moebius, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Schuiten and Peeters, Silvio Cadelo, Tatsuya Egawa, Geof Darrow and Frank Miller. He also names as influences, in no special order: David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alain Resnais, Jean Cocteau, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Seijun Suzuki, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Yoshinori Kanada, Horst Janssen, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Chung&#x27;s animation, particularly &quot;Æon Flux&quot; and &quot;Matriculated&quot;, tends toward the artistically and thematically experimental.

In the animation field, he admires Yoshinori Kanada, Koji Morimoto, and Igor Kovalyov.

Ralph Bakshi, one of the first to hire Chung, has stated that one of Chung&#x27;s favorite artists is Toulouse-Lautrec.

Chung was one of the artists that worked on the &quot;Underground&quot; roleplaying game (1993) from Mayfair Games, and author Shannon Appelcline felt that &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; &quot;was a clear influence&quot; on the game.

In an April 2019 interview with Diego Molano, creator of &quot;Victor &amp; Valentino&quot;, he said that he was fascinated with Chung&#x27;s Aeon Flux and how he uses movement to tell a story even without dialogue. He even paused the show and put tracing paper over Chung&#x27;s drawings, and then sold them at school, showing how Chung&#x27;s style influenced him. Later, Chung would become the animation director on &quot;Victor &amp; Valentino&quot;, which Molano was &quot;greatly thankful for.&quot;

===Personal life===
Chung has also been a participant in online forums, where users have asked him about his work and creative process. Two of the more prominent forums are ILX and Monican Spies.

Chung currently teaches a Master Class at the Division of Animation and Digital Arts at the USC School of Cinematic Arts since Spring 2013.

<text>Campbell &quot;Cam&quot; Cavasso (born October 14, 1950), is an American politician, businessman and perennial candidate. A Republican, Cavasso served three terms in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991, and would later run for both chambers of the United States Congress in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2018.

Born in San Francisco, Cavasso moved with his family to Oahu at a young age. He graduated from University of Colorado Boulder after serving in ROTC, and also spent five years in the United States Army, rising to the rank of captain. Cavasso entered politics in the 1980s, first winning election to the state House of Representatives from District 20 (encompassing parts of Oahu) in 1984. He won re-election twice, and served until 1991. After leaving the state legislature, Cavasso worked as a financial advisor and entrepreneur. He made a bid for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in 2002, but he placed third in the primary with just under 14 percent of the vote.

Cavasso has run for the United States Senate three times and the United States House of Representatives once. In 2004, he challenged seven-term Democratic senator Daniel Inouye, securing the Republican nomination but losing the general election with 21 percent of the vote. He again challenged Inouye in 2010, and received approximately 22 percent. Following Inouye&#x27;s death in 2012, a special election was called in 2014 to determine who would serve out the last two years of his term. Cavasso again won the Republican nomination, and faced appointed Senator and former lieutenant governor Brian Schatz. Cavasso received almost 28 percent of the vote, improving on both his vote total and vote percentage from his two previous runs, but still lost to Schatz by over 40 points. He was the Republican nominee for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 2018, winning by over 60 points in the August primary. In the general election, he received 23 percent of the vote against Democratic congressman Ed Case, marking his fourth consecutive general election defeat.

Cavasso is regarded as a social and fiscal conservative, known for his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. During his congressional runs, Cavasso praised the leadership of Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, and was critical of President Barack Obama&#x27;s policies, in particular the Affordable Care Act. He also supports repealing regulations which he regards as burdensome to business, and made the high cost of living in Hawaii a key issue in multiple campaigns.

==Early life==
Cavasso was born on October 14, 1950, in San Francisco, California, the eldest of three sons (Joseph and David younger brothers) of Leon Cavasso Jr., a coffee broker and salesman, and June Campbell Cavasso, a homemaker, secretary, and daughter of a New Jersey Christian minister and pastor, Charles Henry Campbell, and his wife Elsie Campbell. His paternal great–grandfather, Frank Davey, was a Hawaii adventurer and photographer who served the royalty in the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1896 to 1905. Davey&#x27;s photographs include those of Princess Kaiulani on the steps of her home at Ainahou, Hawaii, and the “Lei Makers” in the early years of Honolulu.

Cavasso and his family relocated to Oahu, Hawaii, in October 1961, and he graduated from Kailua Elementary School, Kailua Intermediate School, and Kailua High School.

== Early adulthood ==
Awarded a four-year ROTC scholarship to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1973. In his junior year, he spent two semesters as a foreign exchange student at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, he served five years in the United States Army from 1973 to 1978, rising to the rank of captain.

Cavasso currently resides with Tula, his wife of years, and four children and four grandchildren on a small -acre turf farm in Waimanalo, Hawaii. He is a lay minister in his Christian church and has served as a Bible Study group teacher. He is also a longtime avid canoe paddler and current steersman for a senior master crew, has paddled for Lanikai, Kailua, and Kai One, and has stated that paddling is “rewarding and fun.”

Cavasso is a financial advisor with the Mass Mutual Financial Group and the founder and co-owner of Hydroseed Hawaii, LLC, a small business contracting company specializing in hydromulching.

==Political career==
===Legislative tenure===
In 1984, Cavasso was first elected to the Hawaii State House of Representatives, representing District 20, which included Waimanalo in Honolulu County. The district had previously been represented by Democrat (and future US Senator) Mazie Hirono, constituting a pickup for the GOP. Cavasso was re-elected to the seat in 1986 and 1988. While initially a candidate for re-election in 1990, he eventually decided not to run, and was succeeded by Democrat Jackie Young. &quot;Fivethirtyeight&quot; retrospectively remarked that it was through his time in the state legislature that Cavasso established his reputation as &quot;a respectable politician&quot; until his &quot;legacy was overshadowed as he gained a reputation as a perennial loser&quot;.

===2002 lieutenant gubernatorial election===

In 2002, he sought the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii. He finished third with 10,085 votes (13.88%), behind television news anchor Dalton Tanonaka, who took 27,142 votes (37.36%), and former Circuit Court judge Duke Aiona, who won the primary with 35,422 votes (48.76%). Aiona thus became the running mate of former Maui Mayor Linda Lingle; the ticket won with 51 percent of the vote in the November election.

===2004 U.S. Senate election===
In 2004, Cavasso ran for the Republican nomination to challenge eight-term Democratic senator Daniel Inouye. He stated that he decided to run in July 2004, following Inouye&#x27;s vote against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would ban gay marriage at the federal level. He prevailed in the Republican primary, winning 21,645 votes for 49.2 percent of all ballots cast, against three competitors. Inouye emerged from the Democratic primary with only token opposition, meaning that Inouye and Cavasso would face each other in the November election (as well as independent candidate Jim Brewer and Libertarian candidate Jeff Mallan). During the campaign, Cavasso contended that Inouye was too liberal for Hawaii, and that the Senator&#x27;s positions on issues like abortion and gay marriage (both of which he supported) were &quot;out of touch&quot; with what Hawaiians wanted. He also argued that Inouye had made Hawaii too dependent on federal funding, and promised that if elected, he would seek to position the state as &quot;a technology center and a bridge between Asia and the mainland&quot;. He also voiced support for Bush&#x27;s tax cuts and invasion of Iraq, both of which Inouye opposed, and the United States PATRIOT Act, which Cavasso indicated in a questionnaire did not &quot;go too far&quot; in his view.

On Election Day, Inouye won 313,629 votes (75.51%) to Cavasso&#x27;s 87,172 (20.99%). Exit polling by CNN found that Cavasso won a majority among Republicans and self-identified conservatives, as well as losing by only one point among those who strongly approved of Bush&#x27;s job performance, while significantly trailing Inouye among most other demographics. Despite his loss, Cavasso speculated that he nonetheless impacted the balance of power in the Senate, by forcing Inouye to devote resources to his own campaign and therefore lessening his ability to help fellow Democrats, such as Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who narrowly lost re-election the same year.

===2010 U.S. Senate election===

Cavasso again ran for the U.S. Senate again in 2010, winning the Republican primary with 23,033 votes (66.94%) against two opponents. Cavasso was regarded as the underdog in the general election, including by the candidate himself; in one television spot to promote his campaign, he jokingly referred to himself as &quot;crazy&quot; for again taking on Inouye, who had served eight terms in the Senate and continued to be widely popular in the state. Cavasso had a severe fundraising deficit compared to Inouye, having raised $220,000 (much of it self-funded) to Inouye&#x27;s $5.2 million. Inouye ultimately outraised Cavasso by a ratio of 25 to 1. Cavasso campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and limited government, criticizing Inouye for his support of the 2008 bailouts and of congressional earmarks and commenting that the nation&#x27;s financial state was as &quot;crazy&quot; as his own underdog campaign. Polling found Cavasso trailing Inouye by a large margin, although one poll — conducted by Rasmussen Reports the month before the election — found him only thirteen points behind his Democratic opponent, regarded as a much closer-than-expected margin.

Cavasso ultimately received 79,939 votes, or 21.6 percent of all ballots cast; Inouye received over 277,000 votes, winning by over 53 percentage points. The poll which had indicated a significantly closer contest was later deemed by &quot;Fivethirtyeight&quot; the &quot;worst poll&quot; since at least 1998 in terms of disparity between polling data and election result. Cavasso later reported that Inouye had phoned him after the election to tell him that he had &quot;enjoyed&quot; Cavasso&#x27;s campaign.

===2014 U.S. Senate election===

In December 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye passed away. His ninth term was not filled out, so Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie had to appoint a replacement until a special election could be held in 2014. Inouye&#x27;s dying wish was that his successor be Representative Colleen Hanabusa; however, Abercrombie instead appointed lieutenant governor Brian Schatz to Inouye&#x27;s seat, citing Hanabusa&#x27;s seat on the House Armed Services Committee and &quot;the overall best interest of the party&quot; as his considerations. By October 2013, Cavasso had indicated that he planned to run for the seat, and he officially announced his candidacy in April 2014. Cavasso easily won the Republican nomination in the August primary, receiving over 72 percent of the vote and leading his nearest competitor, John P. Roco, by 60 percentage points. Schatz narrowly won the Democratic primary against Hanabusa, prevailing by under one percentage point and leading to speculation that Hurricane Iselle might have impacted the result.

This set up a general election matchup between Cavasso and Schatz, as well as Libertarian nominee Michael Kokoski, a social worker. Schatz was widely regarded as the presumptive victor, given the state&#x27;s heavy Democratic lean as well as polls that showed him leading by between 25 and 50 percentage points. &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; included the race among its list of the &quot;7 Least Competitive Races&quot; of the cycle. However, Cavasso argued that he was in a better position to win the election than in his two prior campaigns, because Schatz had been appointed by an unpopular governor (Abercrombie lost the Democratic nomination for re-election in 2014 to an underfunded opponent, state legislator David Ige) and because Schatz&#x27;s nomination had gone against Inouye&#x27;s dying wish. During the general election, Cavasso stressed the issue of Hawaii&#x27;s high cost of living and announced that he planned to fight for the repeal of regulations which he regarded as burdensome to businesses in the state; he named the high cost of living to be the biggest issue facing Hawaii. He also emphasized his socially conservative positions on issues such as gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and abortion. He created a series of short YouTube videos to increase name recognition and share his message with voters. Cavasso also called for a series of debates between himself and Schatz, although Schatz declined the invitations, leading Cavasso to at one point inquire, &quot;Where is Schatz? Is he ill?&quot;

In the general election, Schatz prevailed with 246,827 votes (69.78 percent) to Cavasso&#x27;s 98,006 and Kokoski&#x27;s 8,941. Despite his loss, Cavasso&#x27;s vote total and vote share were both higher than in either of his previous Senate campaigns. In an &quot;Associated Press&quot; interview following the result, Cavasso said that he hoped that Schatz would work with the Republican majority in the Senate on issues impacting Hawaiians, such as defense and trade. He also expressed hope that voters would continue to consider the &quot;family and conservative values I have spoken for in this election&quot;.

===2018 U.S. House election===
On January 8, 2018, Hanabusa formally announced her candidacy for governor in the 2018 Hawaii gubernatorial election, challenging incumbent governor Ige in the Democratic primary. This created an open seat in Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district for the 2018 election. Cavasso announced his candidacy for the seat, and ran in the Republican primary against businessman and anti-abortion activist Raymond Vinole. In the August 11 primary, Cavasso prevailed with 10,564 votes, about 82 percent of all ballots cast.

In the general election, Cavasso faced Democratic nominee (and former congressman) Ed Case, Libertarian candidate Michelle Tippens, Green candidate Zach Burd, and nonpartisan candidate Calvin Griffin. Cavasso&#x27;s campaign focused on technology-based campaign methods, including social media; Cavasso remarked that the campaign was the most relaxing and fun he&#x27;d worked on. Cavasso told &quot;KHON&quot; that his objective was to form a winning coalition of Republicans, independents, and conservative Democrats. In an interview with &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;, he remarked that &quot;there is a sense we got this one&quot; (election) and that he believed Hawaiians wanted a stronger Republican Party. During the campaign, Cavasso praised President Donald Trump&#x27;s leadership, particularly in relation to his diplomacy with North Korea and his handling of the economy, and was critical of Hawaii Democrats&#x27;s behavior during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. He also voiced skepticism of man-made climate change and expressed worry that further environmental regulations could increase gasoline prices and hurt Hawaii. He stated that, if elected, he would support Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio for Speaker of the House. Cavasso noted that Republicans currently held the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, and argued that it would benefit Hawaii to have a member of Congress belonging to the majority party.

On October 10, 2018, KITV hosted a debate between the two major-party candidates, focusing on congressional handling of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The two candidates also both attended a forum hosted by the Grassroots Institute of Hawaii at the Pacific Club, where Cavasso criticized Senator Hirono for her handling of the Kavanaugh allegations, calling her &quot;entirely out of order&quot; for telling men to &quot;shut up and step up&quot; on issues of sexual assault. Cavasso reiterated his opposition to the legalization of marijuana, arguing that the opioid epidemic demonstrated that legalization would be counterproductive. He criticized the Affordable Care Act as leading to higher health care costs, and said he would not support Native Hawaiian sovereignty, arguing that they would not be well served by it and quoting a Hawaiian king as saying &quot;we are all of one blood&quot;. On Election Day, Cavasso received 42,498 votes, just over 23 percent of all ballots cast, coming in second place behind Case.

==Political positions==
Cavasso supports socially conservative political positions. He has been a consistent critic of the legalization of same-sex marriage, stating that Inouye&#x27;s opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment was what motivated him to challenge the Senator in 2004. He was also supportive of Hawaii&#x27;s Traditional Marriage Amendment, which granted the state legislature the power to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples; the amendment passed in 1998 with 69 percent of voters in favor. At a 2018 candidate forum, Cavasso expressed his opposition to marijuana legalization, responding that &quot;it&#x27;s taking a chance&quot; and opining that marijuana use can lead to other drugs. He elaborated at the forum: &quot;we have enough problems right now with the opiate epidemic. We have troubles in our nation with drugs. I would under no circumstances encourage the legalization of drugs or the legalization of marijuana&quot;. He also argued in favor of ending Pono Choices, a sex education program in Hawaiian public schools.

He self-identifies as a &quot;constitutional and fiscal conservative&quot;, and has also stated that he believes that &quot;individuals, not government, are best at solving problems and creating opportunities.&quot; Cavasso has called for Hawaii&#x27;s shipping industry to be deregulated, on the grounds that the regulations increase the cost of living. He also supports repealing or revising the Jones Act, which regulates international commerce and stipulates that 75 percent of all crew members on shipping vessels must be American, arguing that it contributes to a higher cost of living in the state. He has suggested that, if the law remains in place, Hawaii should receive an exemption. Cavasso has also been critical of redistributive economic programs, calling them &quot;stealing&quot; and arguing that they disincentivize hard work. He is an opponent of the Affordable Care Act; he suggests that it has impaired competition and that doctors should be permitted to design a health care system.

On climate change, Cavasso has claimed that &quot;The science […] is not settled&quot; and voiced concern that environmental regulations could hurt Hawaii&#x27;s economy. He supports the use of solar power and technological innovation as ways to cut carbon emissions. During his 2014 campaign, he also criticized Schatz for deeming climate change to be the biggest issue facing America, calling the claim &quot;not merely overstating the case&quot;, but &quot;environmental hysteria&quot;. He likened climate change activism to the reaction to the 1968 book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, which warned that widespread starvation would soon result from an overpopulated earth.

In a 2004 candidate questionnaire, Cavasso called himself &quot;undecided&quot; on the Akaka Bill to grant federal recognition to Native Hawaiians. During his 2018 run for the House of Representatives, Cavasso was critical of proposals for the creation of a Hawaiian nation; he argued that it would be inappropriate for them to receive federal recognition similar to that received by Native Americans, and positing that doing so would be divisive and create a &quot;race-based nation&quot;.

<doc id="1000766" wikidata="Q7122574" url="?curid=1000766" title="Pacific Northwest Ballet">
<text>Pacific Northwest Ballet (PNB) is an American ballet company based in Seattle, Washington. It is said to have the highest per capita attendance in the United States, with 11,000 subscribers in 2004. The company consists of 49 dancers and hosts more than 100 performances throughout the year; it is especially known for its performance of the Stowell/Maurice Sendak &quot;Nutcracker&quot;, which it presented from 1983 through 2014 and produced as a in 1986. 

In 2006, the company was chosen to perform at the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival and New York City Center&#x27;s Fall for Dance Festival.

PNB performs at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall in the Seattle Center.

== History ==
Pacific Northwest Ballet was founded in 1972 following the two-month residency of the First Chamber Dance Company, as part of Seattle Opera and named the Pacific Northwest Dance Association. Under the directorship of Kent Stowell and Francia Russell, originally of New York City Ballet, it broke away from the Opera in 1977 and took its current name in 1978. Stowell and Russell left at the end of the 2004–2005 season. A portrait by artist Michele Rushworth was painted of Stowell and Russell and installed in the Phelps Center, Seattle, to commemorate their careers and retirement. Both had studied with and danced for George Balanchine.

In July 2005, Peter Boal succeeded Stowell and Russell as artistic director following their retirement. After dancing with the New York City Ballet for 22 years, he had been a full-time faculty member at The School of American Ballet from 1995-2005.

In 2013, the company and its orchestra toured to New York for the first time in sixteen years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; dance critic Alastair Macaulay, stated of their presentation that &quot;This is a true company,&quot; more &quot;unified in its understanding of Balanchine&quot; than the New York City Ballet.

In 2012, PNB brought in Twyla Tharp as its first artist in residence for a year-long residency.

== Pacific Northwest Ballet School ==
The Pacific Northwest Ballet School was founded in 1974. Formerly directed by Francia Russell, and now directed by Peter Boal, it has been considered to be &quot;one of the leading, if not the definitive, professional training school in the country.&quot; The teaching is structured on that of the School of American Ballet. Pacific Northwest Ballet holds an annual summer course in the month of July and is considered one of the leading summer dance education facilities in the country.

== Dancers ==
Pacific Northwest Ballet is noted for choosing dancers that have physique, expressivity and a variety of body shapes.

<doc id="1000768" wikidata="Q84305" url="?curid=1000768" title="Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach">
<text>Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (20 July 1656 – 5 April 1723) was an Austrian architect, sculptor, engraver, and architectural historian whose Baroque architecture profoundly influenced and shaped the tastes of the Habsburg Empire. His influential book &quot;A Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture&quot; (1721) was one of the first and most popular comparative studies of world architecture. His major works include Schönbrunn Palace, Karlskirche, and the Austrian National Library in Vienna, and Schloss Klessheim, Holy Trinity Church, and the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg.

==Early life==
Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach was born in Graz and baptized in the parish church of Heiligen Blut on 20 July 1656. His parents came from notable Graz families: his father was a provincial sculptor and artisan, his grandfather was a bookseller, and his mother was the daughter of a joiner and married to a sculptor before her second marriage. Raised in the tradition of Styrian craftsmanship in a city of significant architectural achievements, Johann received his early training as a sculptor in the workshop of his father, Johann Baptist Fischer, who contributed to the interior sculptural decorations of the Landhaus and Eggenberg Palace in Graz. During the seventeenth century, the Princes of Eggenberg had emerged as important patrons of the arts in Styria; through their patronage of Johann Baptist, they arranged for his talented son to travel to Italy and work in the flourishing artistic environment of the late Italian Baroque. 

In 1671, at the age of sixteen, Johann moved to Rome and joined the workshop of his fellow Austrian Johann Paul Schor and of the great Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who gave him ample opportunities to study both ancient and modern sculpture and architecture. By 1685, he had followed Schor to Naples, where he was reported to have amassed a considerable fortune serving the Spanish viceroy.

Back in Austria in 1687, Fischer von Erlach was installed as a fashionable and sought-after architect. Commissions were plentiful, as royalty and highest echelons of aristocracy sought to repair the damage inflicted on their country residences by the Ottoman Turks in the course of their 1683 campaign. Fischer&#x27;s understanding of an urbane Baroque idiom appeared superior to that prevalent in Central Europe, and in 1687 he secured the key position of court architect, which he would retain in the service of three emperors.

==Service under Emperor Joseph I==
During the 1690s, which have been described as the most fruitful period of Fischer&#x27;s career, he adapted the Italian Baroque to local needs and traditions. In 1690, he won great acclaim for two temporary triumphal arches constructed in Vienna to celebrate Joseph I&#x27;s coronation. He later personally instructed Joseph in architectural arts, so successfully that in 1696 the monarch elevated Johann Fischer to the nobility, as Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach.

In his 17th-century designs and commissions, Fischer von Erlach embraced Berniniesque&#x27;s powerful curving lines, seeking to convey a sense of movement. His other inspirations included Mansart&#x27;s country residences and the Palladian classical villas, which he would study during his journeys to Prussia, the Netherlands, England in 1704 and Venice in 1707.

Thus Fischer presided over the genesis and early evolution of a distinctive brand of Baroque architecture, which would shape the architectural tastes of the Austrian aristocracy for decades to come. His emblematic design from the 1690s was the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy, commenced in 1695 in Vienna. As Hans Aurenhammer put it, this edifice represented &quot;a new type of town palace characterized by impressive form, structural clarity, and the dynamic tension of its decoration&quot;.

==Salzburg and late works==
Fischer&#x27;s expertise in town planning made itself felt in designs he executed for the Archbishop of Salzburg. Particularly accomplished are two churches, the Holy Trinity Church (&quot;Dreifaltigkeitskirche&quot;) (1694–1702) and the Kollegienkirche (Collegiate Church) (1696–1707), whose highly pitched domes and towers, convex facades, and dynamic forms irrevocably changed the outline of Salzburg. They say that masses of stone were designed by Fischer so as to give the appearance of billows of cloud and smoke. The archbishop&#x27;s country seat, Schloss Klessheim (1700–09), was also designed by him.

Fischer&#x27;s visit to Dalmatia brought back to Western Europe the influence of the classical Diocletian&#x27;s Palace and provided Europe with one of the first professional architectural glimpses of this notable Roman monument.

After Joseph I&#x27;s death in 1711, Fischer von Erlach was rarely entrusted with new commissions, as the more pleasing and less demanding designs of his rival Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt proved more popular with the young monarch Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and his court. He found an opportunity to draw some of the finest architectural reconstructions of the buildings of Antiquity, which were published in his groundbreaking &quot;Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture&quot; in 1721. He was also made responsible for various administrative tasks, which would take a large portion of his energy and time.

Clam-Gallas Palace in Prague, commenced in 1713, was one of his last designs for a stately town residence. Much imitated by later architects, the structure highlights Fischer&#x27;s enthusiasm for Palladian facades, which became ever more pronounced during the last period of his work.

But it is Karlskirche in Vienna, started in 1715, that most fully illustrates his late synthetic style. In this structure, completed by his son Joseph Emanuel, Fischer&#x27;s ambition was to harmonize the principal elements and ideas that underlie the most significant churches in the history of Western architecture: the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Pantheon and Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, the Dome des Invalides in Paris and Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

<doc id="1000781" wikidata="Q373936" url="?curid=1000781" title="Theodore McCarrick">
<text>Theodore Edgar McCarrick (born July 7, 1930) is a laicized American Catholic bishop, former cardinal, and former priest who served as Archbishop of Newark from 1986 to 2000 and as Archbishop of Washington from 2001 to 2006. In 2019, McCarrick was defrocked after having been convicted of sexual misconduct in a canonical trial.

Ordained a priest in 1958, McCarrick became an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York in 1977. He then became Bishop of Metuchen in 1981. From 1986 to 2000, he served as Archbishop of Newark. He was created a cardinal in February 2001 and served as Archbishop of Washington from 2001 to 2006. A prolific fundraiser, he was connected to prominent politicians and was considered a power broker in Washington, D.C. Within the church, McCarrick was generally regarded as a moderate.

McCarrick was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians for decades. Though multiple reports about McCarrick&#x27;s alleged conduct with adult seminarians were made to American bishops and the Vatican between 1993 and 2016, Pope Francis was reportedly unaware of allegations of sexual abuse against minors until 2018. In July 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story detailing a pattern of sexual abuse of male seminarians and minors by McCarrick. Following credible allegations of repeated sexual misconduct towards boys and seminarians, McCarrick was removed from public ministry in June 2018. In July 2018, he became the first cardinal to resign from the College of Cardinals because of claims of sexual abuse, and he was laicized in February 2019. After a church investigation and trial, McCarrick was found guilty of sexual crimes against adults and minors and abuse of power and dismissed from the clerical state in February 2019. He is the most senior church official in modern times to be laicized, and his is the first known case of a cardinal having been laicized for sexual abuse. Several honors he had been awarded, such as honorary degrees, were rescinded.

McCarrick&#x27;s case sparked demands for accountability and reform in the Catholic Church. On October 6, 2018, the Holy See announced that Pope Francis had ordered &quot;a thorough study&quot; of the Vatican&#x27;s records on McCarrick &quot;to ascertain all the relevant facts, to place them in their historical context and to evaluate them objectively&quot;. That study led to the publication of a report by the Secretariat of State November 2020.

== Early life and education ==
An only child, McCarrick was born into an Irish American family in New York City to Theodore E. and Margaret T. (née McLaughlin) McCarrick. His father was a ship captain who died from tuberculosis when McCarrick was three years old, and his mother then worked at an automobile parts factory in The Bronx. As a child, McCarrick served as an altar boy at the Church of the Incarnation in Washington Heights. He was expelled from the Jesuit Xavier High School in his junior year for missing classes.

McCarrick missed an academic year due to the expulsion, but a friend of his family was able to help get him into the Jesuit Fordham Preparatory School. At Fordham, he was elected student council president and served in the ROTC program for the United States Air Force. McCarrick studied in Switzerland for a year before returning to the United States and attending Fordham University.

McCarrick later entered St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy (1954) and a Master of Arts in theology (1958). McCarrick is a polyglot, speaking five languages (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish).

== Priesthood ==
McCarrick was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York, on May 31, 1958. From 1958 to 1963, he furthered his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., earning a PhD in sociology. He then served as an assistant chaplain at the Catholic University, becoming dean of students and director of development.

McCarrick served as president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico from 1965 to 1969, and was given the honorary title of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness in 1965. While president, he was one of the authors of the Land O&#x27;Lakes Statement in 1967. In 1969, Cardinal Terence Cooke recalled McCarrick to New York. McCarrick was an associate secretary for education and an assistant priest at Blessed Sacrament parish from 1969 to 1971. He was Cooke&#x27;s secretary from 1971 to 1977. He was later accused of sexually abusing a male minor during this period.

== Episcopal career ==
=== Auxiliary bishop of New York ===

In May 1977, McCarrick was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Rusibisir by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Cardinal Cooke, with Archbishop John Maguire and Bishop Patrick Ahern serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Come Lord Jesus&quot; (). As an auxiliary to Cardinal Cooke, he served as vicar of East Manhattan and the Harlems.

=== Bishop of Metuchen ===
On November 19, 1981, McCarrick was appointed the first bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen, New Jersey. He was installed at St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral on January 31, 1982. During his tenure, McCarrick erected new parishes in Perth Amboy, Califon, Skillman, Old Bridge, and Three Bridges. He was also on the Bishops&#x27; Ad Hoc Committee which revised the New American Bible in 1986 and oversaw the development of the Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, Bishop&#x27;s Annual Appeal, and ministries for blacks and Hispanics, anti-abortion activities, and the disabled.
In 2001 a Catholic high school, originally established in 1885 and renamed multiple times through the years, was named Cardinal McCarrick High School in honor of McCarrick as the first bishop of the diocese. The school, which was located in South Amboy, closed in June 2015 for financial reasons.

=== Archbishop of Newark ===
On May 30, 1986, McCarrick was appointed the fourth Archbishop of Newark. He succeeded Peter Leo Gerety, and was installed at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart on the following July 25. During his tenure, he established the Office of Evangelization, ministries for Hispanics and victims of HIV, and a drug prevention program. He also promoted vocations, and ordained a total of 200 priests for the archdiocese.

McCarrick became known as an advocate for social justice, once saying, &quot;[T]he Church cannot be authentic unless it takes care of the poor, the newcomers, the needy.&quot; During the 1980s, he served as an official observer to the Helsinki Commission and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the behest of the State Department. In 1988, he participated in an interfaith meeting with Fidel Castro to promote religious freedom in Cuba, the first meeting of its kind subsequent to the fall of Fulgencio Batista. McCarrick, as a representative of Irish immigrant families, was chosen to be placed in the Ellis Island Hall of Fame on December 8, 1990.

Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), he served as chairman of the Committee on Aid to the Church in Central and Eastern Europe from 1992 to 1997. In this capacity, he visited such countries as Serbia and Montenegro, the Baltics, and Kazakhstan. He was twice elected to head the USCCB&#x27;s Committee on Migration, and once asked the Congress &quot;to recognize and support the important task of nurturing new citizens so that they may begin to play a full role in the future of this nation.&quot; He later became a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants.

He was elected chairman of the Bishops&#x27; Committee on International Policy in 1996. He visited Bosnia (which he described as &quot;reminiscent of the Holocaust&quot;), China, Poland, Romania, Russia, Rwanda, and Switzerland. Joined by Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, he announced an initiative in 1997 to assure that Catholic school uniforms in his archdiocese would not be manufactured in sweatshops. In 1998, in addition to his duties as archbishop, McCarrick was designated as superior of the Roman Catholic Mission &quot;sui iuris&quot; of the Turks and Caicos Islands; he delegated this mission to priests of the Neocatechumenal Way.

=== Archbishop of Washington ===
Pope John Paul II appointed McCarrick Archbishop of Washington, D.C. in November 2000. McCarrick was formally installed as the fifth archbishop of Washington at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle on January 3, 2001. On February 21, 2001, John Paul made him a cardinal, assigning him as cardinal priest to the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI.

In June 2004, McCarrick was accused of intentionally misreading a letter from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger recommending that Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights be denied the Eucharist. McCarrick led a successful push to have the USCCB allow the bishops of individual dioceses to determine who was or was not eligible to receive the sacrament of communion. Fr. Richard John Neuhaus said, &quot;The bishops I have talked to have no doubt that [McCarrick&#x27;s] presentation did not accurately represent the communication from Cardinal Ratzinger.&quot; McCarrick said that he did not want to cause &quot;a confrontation with the Sacred Body of the Lord Jesus in my hand,&quot; and added that &quot;the individual should be the one who decides whether or not he is in communion with the Church&quot; and therefore eligible to receive the sacrament. McCarrick later met with then senator John Kerry, a Catholic and the Democratic nominee in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Some Catholics felt Kerry should not have been allowed to receive Communion due to his political position favoring abortion rights.

Although McCarrick was sometimes labelled a liberal, he was noted for adhering to church teaching on abortion, same-sex marriage, and the male-only priesthood. American Catholic journalist Michael Sean Winters disputed this claim, writing, &quot;Liberals embraced him as a champion of moderation at a time when the Church was seen as increasingly reactionary. I always thought he was playing to the cameras.&quot;

== Post-retirement activities ==

On May 16, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI accepted McCarrick&#x27;s resignation as Archbishop of Washington, after the latter&#x27;s reaching the customary age limit of 75, and appointed Donald Wuerl, Bishop of Pittsburgh, as the 6th Archbishop of Washington, DC. From May 16, 2006, until Wuerl&#x27;s installation on June 22, 2006, McCarrick served as the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Washington, an interim post.

After his retirement, McCarrick resided for some time at the Redemptoris Mater seminary in the Archdiocese of Washington. He subsequently moved to the grounds of the provincial headquarters of the Institute of the Incarnate Word in Chillum, Maryland, in a building on a complex that included a seminary. McCarrick was named a counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2007.

In 2009, McCarrick presided over the graveside service of U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery, where he read from a letter Kennedy had written to Pope Benedict XVI. In 2015, he served as one of the concelebrants at the funeral of Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, son of President Joe Biden, (then Vice President) and presided over the closing Mass as well.

Within the church, McCarrick &quot;was always seen as a moderate, centrist presence in the hierarchy, a telegenic pastor who could present the welcoming face of the Church, no matter what the circumstances&quot;. A news article identified him in 2014 as &quot;one of a number of senior churchmen who were more or less put out to pasture during the eight-year pontificate of Benedict XVI&quot;, adding that after the election of Pope Francis he found himself put &quot;back in the mix.&quot; He was described as a &quot;pope maker&quot; by David Gibson, longtime religion reporter and author of &quot;The Coming Catholic Church&quot;.

During his retirement, McCarrick pressed House Speaker John Boehner to take up immigration reform. McCarrick spent a significant amount of time traveling and engaging in inter-religious dialogue. In April 2014, at the request of the U.S. State Department, McCarrick (along with a Muslim and an Evangelical cleric) made a trip to the Central African Republic, a country suffering from ethnic and interreligious violence. In May 2014, he traveled with Pope Francis to the Holy Land. McCarrick traveled to Armenia to discuss Syria with Eastern Orthodox clerics, the Philippines to visit typhoon victims, China for discussions on religious freedom, Iran for talks on nuclear proliferation, and served as a Vatican intermediary for the U.S.-Cuba talks.

On January 27, 2017, in response to rumors that President Donald Trump was planning to appoint Catholic commentator George Weigel ambassador to the Holy See, then-Cardinal, McCarrick wrote to Pope Francis stating that Weigel was &quot;very much a leader of the ultra-conservative wing of the Catholic Church in the United States and has been publicly critical of Your Holiness in the past.&quot; He added, &quot;Many of us American bishops would have great concerns about his being named to such a position in which he would have an official voice, in opposition to your teaching.&quot; McCarrick indicated interest in discussing the topic further with the Pope, but there are no indications in their correspondence of whether he did so.

On June 20, 2018, McCarrick was removed from public ministry following a credible allegation that he had sexually abused a minor. On July 27, 2018, McCarrick was ordered by Pope Francis to observe &quot;a life of prayer and penance in seclusion&quot;, and the Pope and accepted his resignation from the College of Cardinals. On February 16, 2019, the Holy See Press Office announced that McCarrick had been laicized. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), in a church penal process, found McCarrick guilty of &quot;solicitation in the Sacrament of Confession, and sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and with adults, with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power&quot;.

== Sexual misconduct ==
===Reports of sexual misconduct ===
In 1994, a priest wrote a letter to Bishop Edward T. Hughes, McCarrick&#x27;s successor as Bishop of Metuchen, stating that McCarrick had inappropriately touched him. Also in 1994, Cardinal Agostino Cacciavillan, then papal nuncio to the United States, received a phone call from a woman who was concerned that there would be a media scandal if Pope John Paul II went to Newark during his 1995 visit to the United States because of &quot;voices (rumors) about McCarrick&#x27;s behavior with seminarians.&quot; Cacciavillan then told Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor, Archbishop of New York, about the woman&#x27;s call. O&#x27;Connor conducted an &quot;investigation, an inquiry&quot; and eventually told Cacciavillan that &quot;there was no obstacle to the visit of the Pope to Newark.&quot; Cacciavillan stated that he did not inform the Vatican. According to Italian journalists Andrea Tornielli and Gianni Valente, Cardinal O&#x27;Connor, in fact, &quot;objected strongly to John Paul II&#x27;s idea of rewarding McCarrick and the diocese of Newark with a stop during his papal visit to the United States in 1995&quot;, but that John Paul&#x27;s personal secretary, Msgr. Stanisław Dziwisz, was able to intercept these objections before they reached the pope. The authors suggest that this was because as bishop, McCarrick was an efficient fundraiser for the Pope&#x27;s causes, including anti-Communist efforts in Poland.

Father Boniface Ramsey stated that he spoke to Thomas C. Kelly, Archbishop of Louisville, about McCarrick in 1993. In 2000, Ramsey wrote to the nuncio, Gabriel Montalvo Higuera, to complain about McCarrick&#x27;s behavior. The letter was forwarded to Leonardo Sandri, the Vatican substitute for general affairs and later, a cardinal. Ramsey said that he tried to speak with Cardinal Edward Egan, then Archbishop of New York, about McCarrick&#x27;s history, but that Egan &quot;didn&#x27;t want to hear it&quot;. In February 2019, the same month McCarrick was laicized by the Vatican, an image of a letter dated October 11, 2006 which Sandri sent to Ramsey, and which illustrates Ramsey&#x27;s account of his involvement in the McCarrick affair, was published by the media, including in a &quot;Commonweal&quot; article which Ramsey himself wrote. The image showed that McCarrick&#x27;s name and Archbishop status were concealed in the letter whenever Sandri mentioned it.

In 2015, Ramsey wrote to Cardinal Seán Patrick O&#x27;Malley, Archbishop of Boston, about McCarrick. O&#x27;Malley stated that he never saw the letter, and that it had been handled &quot;at the staff level.&quot; Richard Sipe stated that he wrote a letter to Benedict XVI in 2008, saying that McCarrick&#x27;s activities &quot;had been widely known for several decades.&quot; Sipe sent a letter to Bishop Robert W. McElroy in 2016, concerning sexual misconduct by McCarrick. McElroy asked if Sipe would be willing to share corroborating material that would substantiate his allegations. Sipe said that he was precluded from sharing specific documentary information. McElroy said &quot;[T]he limitations on his willingness to share corroborating information made it impossible to know what was real and what was rumor.&quot;

Mike Kelly of the &quot;New Jersey Record&quot; reported that in a conversation with Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, Tobin said that around the time he became Archbishop of Newark in 2016, he heard &quot;rumors&quot; about McCarrick having slept with seminarians, but chose not to believe them, stating that at the time they seemed too &quot;incredulous&quot; to be true. Kelly also mentioned that in 1998, based on a tip, he himself had attempted to investigate the rumors, &quot;but no seminarians would talk&quot;.

In 2018, news outlets reported that priests and former seminarians under McCarrick had alleged that McCarrick had engaged in inappropriate conduct with male seminarians. These included reports that he made sexual advances toward young men training as seminarians during his tenure as Bishop of Metuchen and Archbishop of Newark. McCarrick reportedly routinely invited some of these young men to a house on the shore with so few beds that a man would have to share the bishop&#x27;s bed. According to one former seminarian, Desmond Rossi, he and a friend later realized that the archbishop would cancel weekend gatherings &quot;if there were not enough men going that they would exceed the number of available beds, thus necessitating one guest to share a bed with the archbishop&quot;. Rossi subsequently transferred before ordination from the Archdiocese of Newark to a diocese in New York State.

Wuerl denied having any prior knowledge of claims regarding sexual abuse on the part of McCarrick. On January 10, 2019, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a story stating that Wuerl was aware of allegations against McCarrick in 2004 and reported them to the Vatican. In a January 12, 2019 letter, Wuerl stated that when &quot;the allegation of sexual abuse of a minor was brought against Archbishop McCarrick, I stated publicly that I was never aware of any such allegation or rumors.&quot; But the context, he said, was in discussions about sexual abuse of minors, not adults. He later said, in a letter dated January 15, to the priests of the archdiocese, that the survivor in the previous Pittsburgh case had asked that the matter be kept confidential, and he heard no more about it: &quot;I did not avert to it again&quot;; &quot;only afterwards was I reminded of the 14-year-old accusation of inappropriate conduct which, by that time, I had forgotten.&quot; 

In August 2019, letters and postcards that McCarrick sent to his alleged victims were made public. Two abuse prevention experts who reviewed the letters and postcards for the Associated Press described the correspondence as &quot;a window into the way a predator grooms his prey.&quot;

=== Additional allegations, removal from ministry, and resignation as cardinal ===
On June 20, 2018, McCarrick was removed from public ministry by the Holy See, after a review board of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York found an allegation &quot;credible and substantiated&quot; that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old altar boy while a priest in New York. Patrick Noaker, the attorney for the anonymous complainant, alleged two incidents at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, one in 1971 and the other in 1972. Noaker stated that when measuring the teen for a cassock, McCarrick &quot;unzipped [the boy&#x27;s] pants and put his hands in the boy&#x27;s pants.&quot; McCarrick stated that he was innocent of these charges: &quot;I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence.&quot; He also stated, &quot;In obedience I accept the decision of The Holy See, that I no longer exercise any public ministry.&quot; Also on June 20, 2018, Tobin revealed that during McCarrick&#x27;s ministry in New Jersey, there had been accusations of sexual misconduct with three adults, and that two of the allegations had resulted in confidential financial settlements with the complainants.

On July 5, 2018, Fordham University rescinded an honorary degree and other honors it had granted McCarrick. The Catholic University of America, where McCarrick earned two degrees and served in a variety of spiritual and administrative positions, also revoked the honorary degree it had awarded him in 2006. On July 16, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a front-page article describing McCarrick&#x27;s abuse of adult seminarians. On July 19, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article based on the story of a man named James, whose last name was withheld. A New Jersey man whose uncle had known McCarrick since high school, James alleged that McCarrick had sexually abused him beginning at age 11. James had been the first boy McCarrick had ever baptized. James said that McCarrick had exposed himself to him when he was 11 and had sexually touched him beginning when he was 13. He explained that he tried to tell his father a couple of years later but was not believed. On November 13, James revealed himself as James Grein, and gave a public speech at the &quot;Silence Stops Now Rally&quot; in Baltimore, where he called on Catholics to &quot;reform and reclaim the Church.&quot; Speaking about alleged mishandling of allegations by Catholic bishops, he said, &quot;Our bishops must know that the jig is up.&quot;

On July 27, 2018, Pope Francis ordered McCarrick to observe &quot;a life of prayer and penance in seclusion&quot; and accepted his resignation from the College of Cardinals, the first resignation since Louis Billot, a French prelate, resigned in 1927 when he refused an order to withdraw his support of Action Française, a monarchist movement that Pope Pius XI had condemned. He is also the first cardinal to resign after allegations of sexual abuse. The Pope took this action before the accusations were investigated by church officials, the first time an order of penance and prayer has been issued before a church trial. McCarrick was not laicized (removed from the priesthood) at the time, pending the completion of a canonical trial. The Holy See announced on July 28, 2018, that Pope Francis had ordered Archbishop McCarrick (as he then became known) to obey an &quot;obligation to remain in a house yet to be indicated to him&quot; and also observe &quot;a life of prayer and penance until the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial.&quot; In December 2019, McCarrick was sued by a man named John Bellocchio, who said that McCarrick sexually abused him when he was a 14-year-old boy in the 1990s.

=== 2018 Viganò letter ===
On August 25, 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, released an 11-page letter describing a series of warnings to the Vatican regarding McCarrick. Viganò stated that Montalvo, then nuncio to the United States, had informed the Vatican in 2000 of what Viganò characterized as McCarrick&#x27;s &quot;gravely immoral behaviour with seminarians and priests.&quot; He further stated that Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the nuncio from 2005 to 2011, had also informed the Vatican. Viganò says that in 2006 – when working at the Vatican – he wrote his own memo regarding McCarrick. He said nothing was done, however, to stop McCarrick. In 2008, Viganò says he wrote a second memo, including material from Sipe.

In 2009 or 2010, according to Viganò, Pope Benedict XVI placed severe restrictions on McCarrick&#x27;s movements and public ministry, not allowing him to travel beyond the grounds of the seminary where he was living and not permitting him to say Mass in public. According to Viganò, however, Pope Francis subsequently removed these sanctions and made McCarrick &quot;his trusted counselor&quot;, even though Francis &quot;knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator. He knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end.&quot; Italian journalists Tornielli and Valente, however, report that &quot;it was in 2007 – not 2009, as Viganò has said – that Pope Benedict XVI issued his &#x27;instructions&#x27; to McCarrick.&quot; McCarrick responded in a 2008 letter to Vatican Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, writing that he had shared his bed with seminarians. He said that &quot;this was never done in secret or behind closed doors,&quot; and that he had never &quot;had sexual relations with anyone, man, woman or child, nor have I ever sought such acts.&quot;

Viganò called on Pope Francis and all others who he said covered up McCarrick&#x27;s conduct to resign. It was observed that during the time McCarrick was allegedly under sanction, he maintained a &quot;robust public presence&quot; full of international travel, public masses, speeches, and the acceptance of awards, although in July 2010, on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, he declined an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The reporter said that the Cardinal seemed to be avoiding the media. Both Cardinal Marc Ouellet, having been asked to come forward in 2018 by Viganò, and the &quot;2020 Vatican Report on McCarrick&quot; largely confirmed Viganò&#x27;s statements that the Vatican under Benedict XVI imposed restrictions on McCarrick, although McCarrick proved often unwilling to follow them. The report also found that Viganò actively sought harsh sanctions for McCarrick while working as an official in the Secretariat of State. Both Oullet and the report, however, disputed Viganò&#x27;s accusations against Francis, with the report admitting only that Francis heard of rumors about sexual impropriety by McCarrick but believed them to be discredited, and did not hear reports about abuse of minors until 2018.

Viganò stated that he discussed McCarrick&#x27;s conduct and the penalties surrounding it with McCarrick&#x27;s successor as Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Wuerl, who he says transgressed the Pope&#x27;s order by allowing McCarrick to continue living at the seminary and therefore putting other seminarians at risk. Wuerl, through his spokesperson, Ed McFadden, denied that he was aware of any restrictions on McCarrick. &quot;Archbishop Viganò presumed that Wuerl had specific information that Wuerl did not have,&quot; McFadden said. McCarrick&#x27;s situation reportedly became easier when Nuncio Pietro Sambi died unexpectedly in July 2011 and was succeeded by Viganò, who, according to Tornielli and Valente, proved less eager to enforce Benedict XVI&#x27;s instructions to McCarrick. Viganò subsequently acknowledged that Pope Benedict had made the restrictions private, perhaps &quot;due to the fact that he (Archbishop McCarrick) was already retired, maybe due to the fact that he (Pope Benedict) was thinking he was ready to obey.&quot;

The McCarrick case, along with the conclusion of the Grand jury investigation of Catholic Church sexual abuse in Pennsylvania, which alleged systematic cover-up of clergy sex abuse by bishops in Pennsylvania over decades, triggered a general call from Catholics across ideological boundaries for greater accountability and transparency in the church. These issues, however, in particular the Viganò allegations, have also escalated tensions in the Catholic Church between ideological liberals and conservatives, especially over the possible role of homosexuality in clergy sex abuse and the alleged complicity of Pope Francis in protecting McCarrick.

On May 28, 2019, McCarrick&#x27;s private secretary, Msgr. Anthony J. Figueiredo, released letters written by McCarrick suggesting that while senior Vatican officials placed restrictions on the former Cardinal after abuse allegations surfaced, they were not official sanctions and were not strictly enforced under the papacies of either Pope Benedict XVI or Pope Francis. In an interview published on May 28, 2019, Francis directly addressed the accusations made in Viganò&#x27;s letter for the first time. He stated that he &quot;knew nothing&quot; about McCarrick&#x27;s conduct. McCarrick claimed to have discussed restrictions that were placed on him with Wuerl, but Wuerl denied that he had any knowledge of such restrictions.

=== Vatican trial and laicization ===
On September 28, 2018, it was announced that McCarrick had moved to the Capuchin St. Fidelis Friary in Victoria, Kansas, the day before. The announcement was unpopular with many of the citizens of Victoria, especially because the friary is near an elementary school. Before McCarrick was laicized, the Archdiocese of Washington was paying a little over $500 a month for his lodging. After he was laicized, the archdiocese stopped the payments, and the friary stated that it would not be receiving remuneration from McCarrick or the local Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina for McCarrick&#x27;s stay, even though McCarrick offered to pay.

On February 16, 2019, the Holy See Press Office announced that McCarrick had been laicized. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), in a church penal process, found McCarrick guilty of &quot;solicitation in the Sacrament of Confession, and sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and with adults, with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power&quot;. The guilty verdict was issued by the CDF on January 11, 2019, and McCarrick appealed. The CDF rejected the appeal on February 13 and McCarrick was notified on February 15. Pope Francis &quot;recognized the definitive nature of this decision made in accord with law, rendering it &quot;a res iudicata&quot; (i.e., admitting of no further recourse)&quot;, meaning it is final and McCarrick has no further opportunity to appeal. The CDF used an expedited administrative process designed for cases in which evidence is overwhelming. McCarrick&#x27;s ordination as a priest and Consecration as a bishop cannot be undone according to sacramental theology, but McCarrick cannot licitly (lawfully) perform any priestly duties, including celebrating Mass, although he may administer the sacrament of Penance to a penitent in danger of death; McCarrick can be stripped of the right to financial support from the church; and his laicization is permanent. McCarrick is the most senior church official in modern times to be laicized.

In an interview with &quot;Slate&quot; published in September 2019, McCarrick stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not as bad as they paint me. ... I do not believe that I did the things that they accused me of.&quot; McCarrick stated he believed the persons making accusations against him were &quot;encouraged to do that&quot; by his &quot;enemies&quot;, and said repeatedly that many young men had come to the beach house without having any problems. McCarrick revealed that he never left the friary and participated in the daily routine of the other men who lived there. In January 2020, it was announced that McCarrick had moved out of the friary to an undisclosed location that was &quot;secluded and away from public attention&quot;. McCarrick reportedly made the decision to move over concerns that media attention regarding his presence there might have a negative impact on the friary and because he wanted to be closer to his family.

=== Seton Hall Title IX investigation ===
On September 5, 2019, it was revealed that an investigation conducted by Seton Hall University found that McCarrick&#x27;s acts of sexual abuse against seminarians at the university were classified as a Title IX offense. Incidents of sex abuse McCarrick committed at both Immaculate Conception Seminary and St. Andrew&#x27;s Seminary were not reported to the university because at the time, they were not compliant with Title IX. The report, which was reviewed by the law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, also accused McCarrick of creating a &quot;culture of fear and intimidation&quot; at Seton Hall University when he led the university as Archbishop of Newark. On August 10, 2020, however, it was revealed that a seminary professor did report in the late 1980s that McCarrick was taking seminary students to his shore house and that this allegation was disregarded by the Catholic Church.

===Vatican report===
On November 10, 2020, the Vatican released a report about the handling of allegations against McCarrick. It states that through an October 1999 letter from Cardinal O&#x27;Connor, Pope John Paul II learned of allegations of sexual deviancy against McCarrick while in the process of considering him for the position of Archbishop of Washington, but that an investigation was paused after three of the four bishops tasked with looking into the accusations provided &quot;inaccurate and incomplete information.&quot; John Paul II then decided not to appoint him, but changed his mind after receiving a letter from McCarrick proclaiming his innocence. The report suggested that John Paul II was probably influenced by his experience in his native Poland where the communist government used &quot;spurious allegations against bishops to degrade the standing of the Church&quot;. The report states that Benedict XVI asked for McCarrick&#x27;s resignation as Archbishop of Washington in 2005, after learning about the 1994 letter to Hughes. The Vatican Office for Bishops ordered McCarrick to retire to private life verbally in 2006, and put it in writing in 2008, but both times he ignored their instructions. Benedict was also faulted in the report, however, for not standing in the way of McCarrick&#x27;s growing power. According to the report, Pope Francis, prior to becoming pope, had learned of allegations against McCarrick before McCarrick was named Archbishop of Washington, but believed that John Paul II had rejected them. Francis knew of rumors surrounding sexual conduct between McCarrick and adults but received no documentation of sexual impropriety against McCarrick until 2017, and was not aware of accusations of sexual abuse against minors until 2018.

=== Lawsuits and settlements ===
In 2005, the Archdiocese of Newark and the Dioceses of Trenton and Metuchen paid a total of $80,000 to a former priest, who stated that McCarrick would touch him in bed, but only above the waist, and that they never kissed. The Diocese of Metuchen&#x27;s contribution was not in reference to McCarrick, but to an allegation regarding previous conduct of a teacher at a high school located at that time in the diocese.

Between 2005 and 2007, the Diocese of Metuchen and the Archdiocese of Newark paid financial settlements to two priests who had accused McCarrick of abuse. These settlements totalled $180,000. In 2006, $100,000 was paid by the Diocese of Metuchen, where McCarrick had been bishop from 1981 to 1986. The payments were authorized by Bishop Paul G. Bootkoski, who also reported the offenses to law enforcement. According to Donald Cardinal Wuerl, McCarrick&#x27;s successor as Archbishop of Washington, nobody from these dioceses informed him of these settlements, even after the retired McCarrick began living on the grounds of a seminary in the Archdiocese of Washington. In 2010, Sipe published excerpts from the 2005 and 2007 settlement documents.

Between 2001 and 2006, McCarrick gave $600,000 to high-ranking church officials, including two popes, multiple priests, cardinals and archbishops, when he was Archbishop of Washington. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Several of the more than 100 recipients were directly involved in assessing misconduct claims against McCarrick&quot;. Some of those recipients, however, including both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, had little oversight over these transactions.

In August 2019, one of McCarrick&#x27;s alleged victims, James Grein, filed a lawsuit against McCarrick and the Archdiocese of New York. In December 2019, Grein extended his lawsuit to the New Jersey-based Archdiocese of Newark and Diocese of Metuchen, claiming that the two dioceses committed gross negligence when they allowed McCarrick, who Grein stated was a friend of his family, to continue to visit and sexually abuse him. That same month, a new law went into effect throughout New Jersey which allowed more sex victims to file lawsuits. This resulted in more of McCarrick&#x27;s alleged New Jersey victims filing lawsuits against McCarrick and the two Dioceses he served in that state. One of these cases was also reported to be the first sex abuse lawsuit brought against the Holy See, which was accused of receiving reports of sex abuse committed by McCarrick in 1988 and 1995.

In February 2020, &quot;America&quot; magazine revealed that the Diocese of Metuchen, the Archdiocese of Newark, and Diocese of Trenton had, beginning in 2005, worked together to secretly pay victims of McCarrick. Former substitute for general affairs at the Secretariat of State, Leonardo Sandri, who received the letter of concern from Ramsey in 2000, was suspected of participating in the cover-up of McCarrick&#x27;s acts, and &quot;America&quot; journalist Thomas J. Reese recommended that he and others be interviewed as part of the Vatican&#x27;s investigation into the former cardinal.

A lawsuit was filed on July 21, 2020, by an anonymous person saying that McCarrick operated a sex ring out of his New Jersey beachouse. The alleged victim maintained that McCarrick abused him with the assistance of other priests beginning in 1982, when he was 14. The lawsuit stated that boys were assigned different rooms in the house and paired with adult clergymen. The alleged victim, who attended schools operated by the Archdiocese of Newark, alleged priests and others under the control of McCarrick engaged in &quot;open and obvious criminal sexual conduct&quot; that was kept cloaked by the church and also served as &quot;procurers&quot; for McCarrick. The Archidocese of Newark, Diocese of Metuchen, where McCarrick was serving as bishop of at time of the alleged abuse, and the Catholic schools the alleged victim attended where named as defendants in the lawsuit as well. On September 9, 2020, a new lawsuit was filed which alleged that McCarrick kept a second beach house which he also used as a sex ring when he was Bishop of Metuchen. It was also revealed that the Archdiocese of Newark had purchased one of McCarrick&#x27;s Diocese of Metuchen beach houses in 1997, when he was serving as archbishop, just four months before selling the other beach house, which it also purchased from the Diocese of Metuchen, as well.

On November 19, 2020, four people who accused McCarrick of sexually abusing them filed a lawsuit against the Holy See in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, saying it had failed in its oversight of McCarrick over whom it exercised complete control as his employer. The Holy See says priests are not its employees and that its status as a foreign sovereign is a defense from such a suit. In November 2021, a new lawsuit was filed against both McCarrick and the Archdiocese of Newark by Michael Reading, an ordained priest who claimed McCarrick sexually abused him during a visit to the New Jersey shore in 1986. The alleged abuse occurred around the same time McCarrick ordained Reading as a priest.

=== Criminal charges ===
On July 29, 2021, McCarrick was charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old male in 1974, during a wedding reception for the boy&#x27;s brother on the grounds of Wellesley College in Massachusetts. The complaint was filed by Wellesley Police in Dedham District Court. On September 3, 2021, McCarrick pleaded not guilty in Dedham District Court to three counts of indecent assault and battery stemming from the alleged 1974 incident.

In an early 2023 court filing, McCarrick&#x27;s lawyers stated that he had experienced &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;rapidly worsening&quot; cognitive decline, and was thus not fit to stand trial. In June of that year, a state-appointed forensic psychologist found &quot;deficits of his memory and ability to retain information&quot;, and on August 30 the court ruled that McCarrick was mentally incompetent to stand trial.

On April 16, 2023, McCarrick was charged with one count of fourth-degree sexual assault for an April 1977 incident that occurred near Geneva Lake in Wisconsin. McCarrick allegedly abused the victim over a period of time, including at the Geneva Lake residence where he fondled the victim&#x27;s genitals.

== Honorary degrees ==
McCarrick has been awarded at least 35 honorary degrees. Many of these degrees have been revoked or are under consideration for revocation.

<doc id="1000787" wikidata="Q7115463" url="?curid=1000787" title="Oxford Street, Sydney">
<text>Oxford Street is a major thoroughfare in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, running from the south-east border of the Sydney central business district to Bondi Junction in the Eastern Suburbs. Close to the CBD in particular, the street is lined with numerous shops, bars and nightclubs. After the 1980s, Oxford Street garnered a reputation as Sydney&#x27;s primary nightclub strip (firstly gay nightclubs in the 1980s followed by straight nightclubs in the 2000s) and subsequently saw a large increase in the number of crimes committed in the area. However, the 2014 lockout laws saw many nightclubs close and the crime rate drop as Sydney&#x27;s nightlife hubs moved to Darling Harbour and Newtown. The lockout laws ended in 2020 with a focus on small bars and restaurants. Many nightclubs reopened in 2021 especially around Taylor Square.

The western section of Oxford Street, which runs through the suburb of Darlinghurst, is widely recognised as Sydney&#x27;s main gay district and Oxford Street is closed to traffic once a year in early March for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Specifically, the area of Oxford Street between Hyde Park and Paddington Town Hall became known from the early 1980s as &#x27;The Golden Mile&#x27; because of the growing density of popular venues for the gay community. The section to the east of Taylor Square, running through the suburb of Paddington forms an upmarket shopping strip and represents the home of the new medical faculty of the University of Notre Dame Australia as well as the University of New South Wales&#x27; College of Fine Arts, Victoria Barracks, Paddington Bazaar and St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney amongst other locations.

==Route==
Oxford Street starts at Whitlam Square on the south-east corner of Hyde Park at the intersection of Liverpool Street, College Street and Wentworth Avenue on the south-eastern fringe of central Sydney and heads in a south-easterly direction as a four-lane, single-carriageway road through Darlinghurst, where it meets Bourke Street and Flinders Street at Taylor Square. It continues through Paddington, and branches off at the intersection with Syd Einfeld Drive in Woollahra to become a suburban street through Bondi Junction; a portion of it has been converted into a pedestrian mall through its commercial centre. It continues east to terminate a short distance later at the intersection of Old South Head Road, Syd Einfeld Drive and Bondi Road in eastern Bondi Junction.
==History==
In May 1909 the Sydney Council resolved to widen Oxford Street from to by resuming the entire north side of the street between Liverpool and Bourke Streets. The project was carried out in five stages between 1910 and 1914. The result was a new boulevard and the creation of a Federation streetscape which remains today largely intact.

Trams to Bondi and Bronte beaches travelled down Oxford Street until the line was closed in 1960, replaced by the current bus service.

===Paddington Reservoir===
Located on the corner of Oatley Road and Oxford Street is the Paddington Reservoir, a water reservoir which provided water to the Botany Swamps pumping station for the provision of water to parts of Sydney between 1866 and 1899. In 2006 work began to restore and reuse the space of the then derelict Paddington Reservoir. The facility reopened in 2008 as a sunken garden known as the &quot;Paddington Reservoir Gardens&quot; or &quot;Walter Read Reserve&quot;, with a rooftop reserve located above the preserved eastern chamber. The facility integrates the remains of the original brick, timber and iron structure with modern elements of sculptural, structural and functional significance which provide access to the sunken garden via stairs and an elevator as well as ramped access to the rooftop reserve.

===Victoria Barracks===

Victoria Barracks, located in Oxford Street, houses the Headquarters Forces Command (Australia), as well as the Army Museum of NSW which is housed in the original District Military Prison, constructed in 1800. The barracks was constructed of Hawkesbury sandstone by way of convict labour between 1841 and 1846. 
The Barracks were originally occupied by regiments of the British Army who vacated the site in 1870. The Barracks was the premier military training site in Australia until 1901.
For a brief period during the 1930s Victoria Barracks was home to the Royal Military College, Duntroon when the College was forced to close its buildings in Canberra and relocate to Sydney due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression.

===Road classification===
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board. Main Road No. 172 was declared along this road on 8 August 1928, from the boundary with the City of Sydney to Bondi Junction (and continuing east along Bondi Road to Bondi); with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Main Road 172 on 8 April 1929. Its western end was altered to commence at Taylor Square on 2 December 1964, re-aligned along the Bondi Junction Bypass (later named Syd Einfeld Drive when it opened in 1979), then moved closer to the city to start at the intersection with Crown Street on 25 July 1997. 

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Oxford Street retains its declaration as part of Main Road 172.

==Heritage buildings==

The following buildings are on the Register of the National Estate:

* Victoria Barracks (1841–48)
* Paddington Town Hall (1890–91)
* Paddington Public School (1870 and 1892 buildings)
* Uniting Church and Parsonage (1877)
* St Matthias Church Group (1859–61)
* Former St Mattias Rectory (1873)
* St Matthias Church Hall (1882)
* Post Office (1885)

== Oxford Street Mall ==

The pedestrian-only zone of Oxford Street between Bronte Road and Newland Street, Bondi Junction was converted into a pedestrian mall in 1979 when the Eastern Suburbs railway line opened. Prior to the 1960 trams ran along that stretch of Oxford Street. Oxford Street Mall was an alternative to shopping at the nearby shopping centres as it was once home Waltons department store, Flemings and Woolworths Supermarkets and a Timezone arcade. However these stores have since disappeared prior to the 1990s.

Oxford Street Mall is home to numerous shops and cafes and is an entry to many small arcades and shopping centres that are located on this stretch including Meriton Retail Precinct Bondi Junction, Bronka Arcade and The Royal Arcade. Bondi Junction railway station can be accessed through the Meriton Retail Precinct on Rowe Street. Bronka and The Royal Arcade provides direct pedestrian passage way to Spring Street and Eastgate Bondi Junction. Westfield Bondi Junction is located on the Bronte Road end of Oxford Street Mall.

In 2003, Waverley Council upgraded the Oxford Street pedestrian mall and embarked on a general upgrade of streets and footpaths in the commercial area. The upgrade included new footpath tiles, addition of shade sails over new inground rondels and artificial &#x27;tram tracks&#x27; along the entire mall, paving text as cast inlays and glass bead blasting into paving and as well as suspended art installations. The artificial tram tracks are the main features of the mall that commemorate the actual tram line that previously passed through.

Since 2013 there were plans for a light rail to Bondi Beach going along Oxford Street Mall. However in November 2017 Waverley Council had voted to reject any proposals for a light rail along Oxford Street or Bondi Road in favour of local businesses.

== Oxford Street Cycleway ==
After the 2023 WorldPride festival a bidirectional separated cycleway will be constructed between Taylor Square and Hyde Park on Oxford street. 

The City of Sydney announced the original design for a bidirectional centre running &quot;pop up&quot; cycleway in November 2020. After further consultation they announced a new design running on the north edge of the street, and is expectedto be completed in 2025.

According to the City of Sydney, about 2000 people per day ride along Oxford Street amongst traffic on the 6 lane road. 

==Oxford Street revival==

=== 2011 ===
On 27 June 2011, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore proposed new directions for lower Oxford Street, and on 22 August 2011 the Council resolved to undertake a number of short, medium and long term initiatives to activate City owned properties in the precinct. After an Expression of Interest (EOI) was put out for creative and cultural organisations to occupy a vacant city owned property, 16 organisations were announced as being successful applicants and were granted office space as part of the Sydney 2030 plan to revitalise the Oxford Street Precinct with creative and cultural organisations that could help to drive foot traffic to the area as well as promote the community. The 16 organisations that were part of this programme were:
* AroundYou
* The Fortynine
* SCALE Architecture
* Queer ScreenMusic NSW
* Sydney Guild
* Dr Egg

* New Media Production Group 
* Homework
* EngineRoom by Fishburners
* Rouse Phillips Textile Studio
* PROVINCE
* Envelop Entertainment

* World Famous Westsyde
* He Made She Made
* Platform72
* Under New Management
=== 2021–present ===
The City of Sydney unveiled a plan to &quot;breathe new life&quot; into the strip by updating the zoning rules along the strip, including increasing building height limits if developers comply with including community focused uses in the building. 

A major redevelopment, called Oxford &amp; Foley, spanning three blocks on the north side of the strip, is expected to be completed in 2025.

<text>A polar low is a mesoscale, short-lived atmospheric low pressure system (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as the Sea of Japan. The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than and exist for no more than a couple of days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17 m/s (38 mph).

==History==
Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska; however, polar lows also have been found in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller. Still, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean.

==Structure==

Polar lows can have a wide range of cloud signatures in satellite imagery, but two broad categories of cloud forms have been identified. The first is the &quot;spiraliform&quot; signature consisting of a number of cloud bands wrapped around the centre of the low. Some polar lows have the appearance in satellite imagery of tropical cyclones, with deep thunderstorm clouds surrounding a cloud-free ‘eye’, which has given rise to the use of the term &quot;Arctic hurricane&quot; to describe some of the more active lows. These systems are more common deep within the polar air. The second is a &quot;comma-shaped&quot; signature that is found more frequently with systems closer to the polar front.

==Formation==

Polar lows form for a number of different reasons, and a spectrum of systems is observed on satellite imagery. A number of lows develop on horizontal temperature gradients through baroclinic instability, and these can have the appearance of small frontal depressions. At the other extreme are the polar lows with extensive cumulonimbus clouds, which are often associated with cold pools in the mid- to upper-troposphere. During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible (polar lows usually occur with cold air outbreaks).

==Frequency and impact==

Although cyclonic activity is most prevalent in the Eurasian Arctic with approximately 15 lows per winter, polar lows also occur in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. Polar lows occur in the extended winter season, with seldom occurrences during the summer. They are not well studied and seldom destructive as they typically take place in sparsely populated areas. The only infrastructure damage that occurs as a direct result of a polar low is to oil and gas rigs present throughout the Antarctic Ocean (sometimes known as the Southern Ocean). Some cargo and shipping vessels are also affected, although there are minimal or no reports of losses in recent years as the result of a polar low.

Despite the more equatorward location, numerous polar lows can form over the Sea of Japan every year, due to the Japan-Sea Polar-Airmass Convergence Zone (JPCZ) contributed by the cold-core low aloft and the warm Tsushima Current. They would bring severe impacts to Japan owing to the proximity to populous regions, with strong winds and heavy snowfall. On December 28, 1986, seven passenger cars of a railway train were blown from the Amarube Viaduct due to a polar low, causing six deaths.

==Forecasting==

Polar lows are very difficult to forecast and a nowcasting approach is often used, with the systems being advected with the mid-tropospheric flow. Numerical weather prediction models are only just getting the horizontal and vertical resolution to represent these systems.

<doc id="1000798" wikidata="Q3290324" url="?curid=1000798" title="Mardi">
<text>Mardi: and a Voyage Thither is the third book by American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1849. Beginning as a travelogue in the vein of the author&#x27;s two previous efforts, the adventure story gives way to a romance story, which in its turn gives way to a philosophical quest.

==Overview==
&quot;Mardi&quot; is Melville&#x27;s first purely fictional work. Although Melville and his publishers presented his first two books, &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot;, as nonfiction, enough critics were able to identify plagiarism in them (especially &quot;Typee&quot;) from other works, both fiction and nonfiction, that their veracity and Melville&#x27;s integrity were always points of contention. As a preface to &quot;Mardi&quot;, Melville wrote somewhat ironically that his first two books were nonfiction but disbelieved; by the same pattern he hoped the fiction book would be accepted as fact.

Much as did &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot;, &quot;Mardi&quot; details the travels of an American sailor who abandons a whaling vessel to explore the South Pacific. Unlike the first two books, however, &quot;Mardi&quot; is highly philosophical and said to be the first work to show Melville&#x27;s true potential. Although not as cohesive or lengthy as &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, it is much longer than &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; and has much more in common stylistically and thematically with &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and other works of his maturity. 

The tale begins as a fairly simple escape and survival narrative. It briefly becomes romance when the narrator falls in love with a mysterious woman he has questionably rescued from a difficult situation. After the woman mysteriously disappears, the novel presumably becomes a quest for her among the innumerable isles of the newly &quot;discovered&quot; archipelago of Mardi, isles with many different symbolic and allegorical meanings. As the main characters continue their search for the woman, the novel switches again, now focusing on more than travelogue-style reporting of the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells to be experienced in Mardi. The social conventions, political structures, religious practices, odd histories, and other aspects of each isle and its inhabitants spark philosophical discourses between four main characters, with two previously main characters no longer in the story and the narrator receding so far into the background that he does not even participate in the philosophical discussions. The quest for the woman continues but is barely mentioned, serving at least to get the main characters traveling through Mardi faster.

== Style ==

=== Influence of Rabelais and Swift ===
The voyage from island to island echoes Rabelais&#x27;s &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, especially the last two books. According to scholar Newton Arvin: 

:The praise of eating and drinking is highly Rabelaisian in intention, and so in general is all the satire on bigotry, dogmatism, and pedantry. Taji and his friends wandering about on the island of Maramma, which stands for ecclesiastical tyranny and dogmatism, are bound to recall Pantagruel and his companions wandering among the superstitious inhabitants of Papimany; and the pedantic, pseudo-philosophy of Melville&#x27;s Doxodox is surely, for a reader of Rabelais, an echo of the style of Master Janotus de Bragmardo holding forth polysyllabically to Gargantua in Book I. 

Arvin also recognizes the influence of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift:

:... there is something very Swiftian in Melville&#x27;s Hooloomooloo, the Isle of Cripples, the inhabitants of which are all twisted and deformed, and whose shapeless king is horrified at the straight, strong figures of his visitors from over sea.

== Structure ==
The emotional center of the book, Arvin writes, is the relation between Taji and Yillah, the &quot;I&quot; and the mysterious blonde who disappears as suddenly as she appeared. Taji begins a quest for her throughout the islands without finding her. Though Arvin finds the allegory of Yillah &quot;too tenuous and too pretty to be anything but an artistic miscarriage&quot; in the poetic sense, he also finds it &quot;extremely revealing&quot; in connection with the whole Melville canon. Yillah, associated with the lily in the language of flowers, is &quot;an embodiment of the pure, innocent, essentially sexless happiness&quot;, and Hautia, &quot;symbolized by the dahlia&quot;, embodies &quot;the sensual, the carnal, the engrossingly sexual&quot;. The middle portion of the book is taken up by &quot;a series of forays in social and political satire, and by quasi-metaphysical speculations&quot; that are, if at all, at best &quot;only loosely and uncertainly related to the quest for Yillah&quot;. The only way to perceive any fabric holding the book together, Arvin feels, is by recognizing &quot;a certain congruity among the various more or less frustrated quests it dramatizes--the quest for an emotional security once possessed, the quest for a just and happy sociality once too easily assumed possible, and the quest for an absolute and transcendent Truth once imagined to exist and still longed for.&quot;

== Themes ==
For Arvin, in &quot;Mardi&quot; Melville rejects not &quot;the profounder moralities of democracy&quot; so much as &quot;a cluster of delusions and inessentials&quot; that Americans have come to regard as somehow connected to the idea of democracy. Arvin recognizes three delusions to the cluster:
* &quot;that political and social freedom is an ultimate good, however empty of content;
* that equality should be a literal fact as well as a spiritual ideal;
* that physical and moral evil are rapidly receding before the footsteps of Progress.&quot;

The philosophical plot, Arvin believes, is furnished by the interaction between the intense longing for certainty, and the suspicion that on the great fundamental questions, &quot;final, last thoughts you mortals have none; nor can have.&quot; And even while one of the characters says, &quot;Faith is to the thoughtless, doubts to the thinker&quot;, Arvin feels that Melville struggles to avoid a brutality of what Melville himself calls &quot;indiscriminate skepticism&quot;, and he got closest to expressing &quot;his basic thought&quot; in Babbalanja&#x27;s speech in the dark: &quot;Be it enough for us to know that Oro&quot;—God--&quot;indubitably is. My lord! my lord! sick with the spectacle of the madness of men, and broken with spontaneous doubts, I sometimes see but two things in all Mardi to believe:--that I myself exist, and that I can most happily, or least miserably exist, by the practice of righteousness.&quot;

==Reception==

=== Contemporary reviews ===
&quot;Mardi&quot; was a critical failure. One reviewer said the book contained &quot;ideas in so thick a haze that we are unable to perceive distinctly which is which&quot;. Nevertheless, Nathaniel Parker Willis found the work &quot;exquisite&quot;.

Nathaniel Hawthorne found &quot;Mardi&quot; a rich book &quot;with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life ... so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded long over it, so as to make it a great deal better.&quot;

The widespread disappointment of the critics hurt Melville yet he chose to view the book&#x27;s reception philosophically, as the requisite growing pains of any author with high literary ambitions. &quot;These attacks are matters of course, and are essential to the building up of any permanent reputation—if such would ever prove to be mine ... But Time, which is the solver of all riddles, will solve &quot;Mardi&quot;.&quot;

=== Later critical history ===
In the description of Arvin:

== Sources ==

Giordano Lahaderne has proposed that &quot;Mardi&quot; may have been influenced by the Book of Mormon (1830). The opening sequence of each is an &quot;Old Testament in reverse&quot; and &quot;Mardi&quot;&#x27;s second volume includes a discourse on &quot;an illustrious prophet, and teacher divine&quot; named Alma, a name shared by Alma, one of the major prophets and missionaries within the Book of Mormon.

<doc id="1000801" wikidata="Q2397400" url="?curid=1000801" title="Kefka Palazzo">
<text>is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, developed by Square. Yoshitaka Amano created his visual design and director Yoshinori Kitase wrote his scenes. He is one of the most well-known and well-received villains in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He was given a featured role in the fighting game &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and its sequels. He also appears as an enemy boss character in games including &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Artniks&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy All the Bravest&quot;.

Kefka is first introduced as the court mage of Emperor Gestahl. Over the course of the game, he reveals himself to be a nihilistic psychopath, gone mad from the cruel experiments that gave him his magical powers. When Gestahl is poised to seize the source of magic in this world, Kefka betrays him and takes it for himself. With his new godlike powers, Kefka rules the remains of a ruined world with an iron fist.

Kefka is considered one of the most memorable video game villains ever created, with critics and fans noting his intense hatred and maniacal laughter as defining characteristics. He has also been compared to the Joker from the Batman franchise.

==Conception and creation==
Kefka&#x27;s appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano, who was given complete creative freedom in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, with only brief character outlines as guidelines. His approach was to create &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation as small computer sprites. Several designs were created for Kefka during the planning stages, each with different outfits, taking inspiration from clowns seen at circuses. Amano felt the character was akin to DC Comics villain Joker, and wanted to illustrate a character that shared Joker&#x27;s crazy personality, someone that was &quot;completely insane&quot;. He found the overall process fun to develop.

Writer Yoshinori Kitase found the original writing &quot;did not give him much character&quot;, and while working on the very first scene developed for the game, Kefka&#x27;s approach to a castle, Kitase felt it was too boring to do normally. He added a scene off the top of his head where Kefka demanded soldiers dust off his boots in the middle of a desert, meaning for it to imply that there &quot;may be a screw or two missing from this character&#x27;s head&quot;, something he felt was a perfect fit for Kefka and helped define the character&#x27;s personality for the rest of the story. In an interview with &quot;Edge&quot;, Kitase noted that while he wanted to keep story emphasis balanced across the cast, he found that Kefka was one of two characters whose importance in the story grew larger than originally intended when development began. Originally the game was meant to end much earlier with Kefka&#x27;s defeat and the world saved, but when the developers realized they still had plenty of time, they added a second act where Kefka succeeds in devastating the world, leaving the party members scattered across the remains of the &quot;World of Ruin&quot;.

Other developers involved with &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s production also contributed to his characterization. Artist Kazuko Shibuya aimed to illustrate his &quot;crazy and somewhat childish&quot; demeanor through her work on his pixel art and animations, and considers him her favorite character in the franchise. While the rest of the cast had simple traits that were easy to draw, often easy to define as &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;, she felt Kefka wouldn&#x27;t stand out as much if he went through the same process. She utilized bases of red and green in his design to paint him as &quot;very eccentric&quot;, while also wanting to illustrate his dangerous and childish aspects, a character with &quot;no defined limits&quot;. Translator Ted Woolsey, who handled the North American localization of the game, also contributed lines to the character while working on the title, namely in part to get around Nintendo censors. Several of these have appeared in later interpretations of the character in other games, such as Kefka&#x27;s statement about making &quot;a monument to non-existence&quot; in &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;===
Kefka first appears as a general to Emperor Gestahl, serving as his court mage. Prior to the start of the game, he was the first human to be experimentally infused with the magic-like craft &quot;Magitek&quot;, which granted him the ability to wield magic, although the imperfect process warped his mind and made him into the nihilistic psychopath he is during the course of the game. Through the first half of the game, Kefka leads the charge for the city-state of Vector to conquer the world, one kingdom at a time, using their magic weapons. Kefka mentally enslaves Terra and uses her to lead an attack on the town of Narshe to claim the frozen esper Tritoch there. When she escapes Imperial control, he pursues Terra to the kingdom of Figaro, setting the castle ablaze as she, Locke and King Edgar flee.

During a siege on the kingdom of Doma, Kefka grows impatient with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire&#x27;s evils, and to gain the trust of the protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers&#x27; homeworld to create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. However, she refuses and stabs Kefka instead, driving him into a psychotic rage. Kefka and the Emperor then get in a heated argument regarding the power of the triad—the Emperor only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad&#x27;s full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet, bringing about the second act of the game.

Imbued with the power of the statues, Kefka becomes the God of Magic in the ruined world he created, using the statues to forge a massive tower of random debris to serve as his headquarters. Kefka smites the millions who refuse to worship him with his &quot;Light of Judgment&quot;, a beam of incinerating light capable of cutting fissures into the planet&#x27;s surface, although he implies before fighting the Returners that he largely used the Light of Judgment on everyone for his own amusement regardless of whether they worshipped him or not. Confronted by the protagonists at the game&#x27;s conclusion, Kefka reveals his nihilistic motivations: when the protagonists reject his claims, Kefka goes berserk and proclaims his desire to eradicate everything. Upon the defeat of his minions, Kefka reveals his godlike form and, after uttering one final nihilistic vision of life, dreams and hope, attacks the protagonists before he is ultimately slain, causing the power of magic to vanish.

===Other games===
Kefka is the villain representing &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, where the gods Cosmos and Chaos are fighting a cosmic war for control, with Kefka on the side of Chaos. As revealed in its prequel &quot;Dissidia 012&quot;, Kefka controlled Terra while she was a warrior of Chaos until Kuja weakens his spell, allowing Terra to escape and become a warrior of Cosmos with the aid of Vaan. During the events of &quot;Dissidia&quot;, Kefka allies himself with the Cloud of Darkness to bring Terra back to their side so he can use her Esper powers to fulfill his destructive desires. However, mastering her powers, Terra defeats Kefka to obtain her crystal. After Cosmos&#x27;s death, Kefka breaks his ties to the other villains and starts his own scheme to become the ruler of the ruined world before being ultimately dispatched for good. For his appearance in &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot;, Kefka received a considerable amount of work and changes according to producer Tetsuya Nomura and planning director Mitsunori Takahashi, while ranslator Tom Slattery, enjoyed writing new dialogue for Kefka. Additionally, director Takahashi Mitsunori said he felt that developing Kefka&#x27;s attacks such as &quot;reverse magic&quot; felt similar to development of the recurring minor character Gilgamesh&#x27;s attacks, and that the staff enjoyed brainstorming the moves. Kefka&#x27;s Japanese voice actor, Shigeru Chiba, ad-libbed many lines, including shouting seafood words like &quot;Pike!&quot; and &quot;Yellowtail!&quot; Kefka returns again in the third title, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;, fighting as a champion of Spiritus.

Kefka makes cameo appearances in &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot;, &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy: All the Bravest&quot; as an antagonist. He also appears as a huntable villain in a GREE social network card game called &quot;Final Fantasy Artniks&quot;, where players must share information to find and defeat Kefka to earn rewards. In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, Kefka appears as one of Omega&#x27;s creations in the final phase of Sigmascape — the second part of the Omega raid series featured as part of the &quot;Stormblood&quot; expansion. Similarly, this new phase also draws heavily on themes and enemies from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, with his God of Magic form as an additional phase in Savage mode.

==Promotion and reception==

In 2006, Kefka was made into a toy in the Final Fantasy Master Creatures line. The figure is tall from the bottom of the base, representing his final form from the game&#x27;s conclusion. A munny doll of Kefka in his human form was also created by Tomopop. An album of the music from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; entitled &quot;Kefka&#x27;s Domain&quot; was released on July 1, 1994. A figurine was created of Kefka for Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy Creatures Kai Volume 5&quot; in 2012.

Kefka is considered one of the most well received and enduringly popular villains in video games by critics and fans. He has earned a place on numerous &quot;all time&quot; lists from a wide variety of publications including &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, UGO.com, IGN, GamePro, GameSpy, Den of Geek and many more. GamesRadar named him the most &quot;outrageously camp&quot; villain, stating that when compared to Kefka, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; antagonist Sephiroth seems as &quot;interesting as a dead accountant painted brown&quot;. They also compared him to the Joker from &quot;Batman&quot;, praising him for both his villainous ambition and his laugh. Digital Spy recognized him for being responsible for one of the most surprising moments in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series—destroying the world. 

Analyses of Kefka focused on his nihilism and unsympathetic portrayal. Konami video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating that &quot;unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka did not have shades of gray. He didn&#x27;t have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn&#x27;t have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn&#x27;t &#x27;evil for evil&#x27;s sake&#x27;. There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn&#x27;t any good in there&quot;. That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of &quot;Final Fantasy VI Advance&quot;, IGN wrote &quot;it&#x27;s the game&#x27;s maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, Kefka&#x27;s brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed&quot;. IGN also noted his ability to &quot;tap into primal, instinctive fears&quot;, including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as &quot;the unrivaled star of the show...he&#x27;s the kind of villain that you will love to hate&quot;, comparing him to Jack Nicholson&#x27;s portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players&#x27; lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka&#x27;s final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka stems from the fact that he is one of the few villains in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.

&quot;Digitally Downloaded.net&quot; Editor in Chief Matt Sainsbury argued that while the character was &quot;certainly psychopathic&quot; and villainous, Kefka was not &quot;insane&quot;. He added that while Kefka&#x27;s behavior painted him as a dangerous character &quot;we need to hate and want to stop because, in simply existing, he poses a threat to all decent people around him&quot;, his behavior felt completely rational to Sainsbury because Kefka operated off a different moral core than others, and considered this fascinating. Sainsbury cited philosopher Michel Foucault&#x27;s studies on madness, in which it was argued that in civilization&#x27;s need to find an &quot;other&quot; to oppose, something separate from &quot;decent&quot; society, insanity was a common go-to. However Sainsbury felt Kefka&#x27;s behavior came from his &quot;nihilistic understanding on the purpose of life&quot;: creations exist simply to be someday destroyed and forgotten, and that the meaning of existence is non-existence. While Kefka&#x27;s logic runs contrary to most people, Sainsbury described it as still rational and considered thought within the subject of philosophical debate. Additionally he pointed out under philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s view of the world, many of Kefka&#x27;s actions were justified. While the character commits atrocities, he is still effective and his actions need to be considered within the scope of the war the Empire he serves is fighting, and within that frame of reference helped make Kefka a more fleshed out and nuanced villain.
Patrick Dugan of &quot;Escapist Magazine&quot; called Kefka &quot;an androgynous, perverted, wicked little clown [..] Somewhere between Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff and King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;&quot;. He further described him as one of the most memorable &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; villains for how present he was in the game and his personality, feeling he was a necessity in the game&#x27;s story as a representative of &quot;science run amok [...] an Anti-Christ with a surreal laugh&quot;, and that his defeat gave the game&#x27;s closure far greater significance.

The audio design for Kefka has been praised, including his iconic laugh and his signature musical themes, &quot;Kefka&quot; and &quot;Dancing Mad&quot;, by Nobuo Uematsu. Music professor William Cheng called his laugh &quot;quasi-musical&quot; and commended the sound engineers for imbuing character and personality into a limited sound effect. Music researcher Jessica Kizzire tracked Kefka&#x27;s character arc and ascent to godhood through his musical themes. The repetition of &quot;Kefka&quot; in key moments of the game add new layers of meaning to the track. Uematsu included musical allusions to &quot;Kefka&quot; in his themes for Sephiroth and Ultimecia, the villains of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot;, respectively.

<doc id="1000824" wikidata="Q7363106" url="?curid=1000824" title="Romeo Munoz Cachola">
<text>Romeo Munoz Cachola, commonly known as Romy Cachola, is a Democratic politician from the state of Hawaii and former member of the Hawaii State House of Representatives, representing House District 30 (Kalihi Kai, Sand Island, Hickam, Pearl Harbor, Ford Island, and Halawa Valley Estate) since 2012. He formerly served in the Hawaii State House of Representatives from 1984 to 2000. An immigrant from the Philippines, Cachola became one of the first Filipino Americans to be elected to the Honolulu City Council since statehood in 1959.

==Education==
Born in the historic Spanish colonial town of Vigan in the Philippines province of Ilocos Sur, Cachola studied at Quezon University near Manila where he obtained his Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws degrees. After having settled in Honolulu and obtained United States citizenship, Cachola became an entrepreneur and realtor.

==Politics==
With the urging of fellow Filipino Americans in his neighborhood, Cachola ran for the House District 39 seat comprising Aliamanu, Foster Village, and all the military housing districts on the southern coast of Oahu. He served the district until reapportionment in 1991 placed him in House District 30. He successfully ran for the seat and continued his service as a legislator until his election to the Honolulu City Council in 2000, when he replaced outgoing then-Councilmember Donna Mercado Kim in a special election.

In the Honolulu City Council, Cachola served as chairman of key positions with budget authority. As Chairman of the Zoning Committee, he was considered one of the most powerful politicians in the City &amp; County of Honolulu following the mayor, managing director and council budget chairman. In 2003, Cachola was elected by his fellow council members as floor leader. Cachola was reelected to the Honolulu City Council on September 18, 2004.

In 2005, the City Council approved a tax increase to fund mass transit, the largest and most expensive public works project in state history. In 2007, shortly after the tax went into effect, Cachola was the swing vote in a controversial decision to decide the train&#x27;s route. Cachola insisted that the route go through Salt Lake as a condition of his support. Though the Council voted 5-4 to approve a route with Cachola&#x27;s changes, some Salt Lake residents voiced opposition to the noise and property devaluation that they feared rail transit would bring to their community. After the following city elections and over loud objections by Cachola and some Salt Lake residents, the new City Council reconsidered the decision and decided to re-route the rail line to pass by Pearl Harbor and the airport, without a Salt Lake alignment.

Cachola was fined $2,500 in July 2014 by the Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission for state campaign spending violations and had to reimburse his campaign $32,000 for using campaign money to buy a new truck and allegedly use it for personal reasons. He admits no wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement agreement.

In September 2014, the Honolulu Ethics Commission fined Cachola $50,000 &quot;based on a number of aggravating factors in the case, [...] including that the misconduct occurred over several years on a monthly basis, that Cachola knew the ethics laws and their penalties but &#x27;blatantly disregarded&#x27; them, and that he failed to cooperate with the commission during its investigation.&quot; Honolulu Ethics Commission executive director Chuck Totto said in a news release that &quot;[t]his case is a perfect storm of public corruption,&quot; and that the $50,000 was the largest civil fine ever approved by the commission.

In the 2020 Democratic primary elections, he lost his bid for reelection to Sonny Ganaden in a 64% to 36% vote.

<text>The clambake or clam bake, also known as the New England clambake, is a traditional method of cooking seafood, such as lobster, mussels, crabs, scallops, soft-shell clams, and quahogs. The food is traditionally cooked by steaming the ingredients over layers of seaweed in a pit oven. The shellfish can be supplemented with vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and corn on the cob. Clambakes are usually held on festive occasions along the coast of New England, and at fundraisers and political events. Some restaurants and caterers offer clambake-style food.

==History==

It is known that Native Americans in what is now the eastern United States developed techniques to bake (or steam) clams, at least in Florida. Contrary to legend, though, American colonists did not learn to enjoy baked clams from Native Americans. The colonists did not consider clams to be an acceptable human food and instead fed clams to pigs, except during times of famine.

Author Andrew W. German concluded, &quot;There is no question that Native American peoples have been consuming clams for four thousand years but there is little evidence that they prepared them in the traditional New England way. Perhaps they smoked them for preservation, and they probably roasted them in open fires, but neither oral traditions nor early European observations refer to steaming in rockweed. And though we like to imagine the Wampanoags teaching the Pilgrims how to bake clams, there is good evidence that the early European settlers actually eschewed clams as food fit only for the poor, eating them as little as possible.&quot;

The clambake as it is now known does not go back to the colonial period. Consciously based on indigenous foods, it was developed in the United States &quot;after&quot; the American Revolution as 
a part of a created mythology as an &quot;icon of its unique cultural identity&quot;.

The clambake &quot;exploded&quot; in popularity after the American Civil War. Rhode Island businessmen operated many clambake pavilions, and the first published clambake recipe credited that state as the origin. The practice spread throughout New England and on to other parts of the country.

After the Civil War, railroads began carrying fresh Atlantic seafood on ice from New York through Pennsylvania, Ohio and on to Chicago. This was the beginning of the popularity of the clambake in the Cleveland area. The &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; published an article on October 15, 1866, called &quot;Great Clam Bake at Camp Gilbert: A &#x27;Running Account&#x27; Of It&quot;. The writer expressed the &quot;firm opinion that clam bakes were glorious institutions.&quot;

In 1888, a group of Quakers in Dartmouth, Massachusetts held a clambake, which became a traditional annual event each August that continues today. The event, called the &quot;Allen’s Neck Friends Meeting Clambake&quot;, was attended by 625 people in 2017.

In 1950, the Maine Department of Sea and Shore Fisheries published a 12-page booklet titled &quot;How to Prepare a Maine Clambake with Lobsters and All the Fixin&#x27;s&quot;.
The 1975 edition of &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;, the cookbook first published in 1931, describes two versions of a clambake. The big version is cooked in a sandpit, and the small version is cooked in a large pot on a stove or a grill.

== Method ==

According to food journalist Mark Bittman, &quot;Few meals are more beautiful than a well-executed clambake.&quot; A clambake begins with gathering seaweed (traditionally rockweed – &quot;Ascophyllum nodosum&quot;) at the shoreline; seaweed is an important adjunct to cooking the food. To keep the seaweed fresh, it is necessary to have a container large enough to hold both the seaweed and a fair amount of seawater.
Also, important are round medium-sized stones, which are heated in the fire and used to re-radiate heat during the cooking process.

Finally, like most other methods of steaming, a cover is necessary to allow the trapped heat and steam to thoroughly cook the food. Canvas tarps or potato sacks soaked in seawater are often used for this purpose. Sometimes, canvas sails are used.

Once the stones and seaweed have been collected, a fire pit is prepared. Some prefer to simply start a fire within the pit, while others line the edges with flat stones to provide support for a metal grill on which the stones may be placed.

The stones used for cooking are then placed in the center of the pit and a wood fire is started, although the exact method of heating the stones varies. The fire must burn until the stones are glowing hot. Care must be taken to ensure that the fire will burn out shortly after this optimal cooking temperature is achieved. The ashes are then swept off the stones and raked between them to form an insulating &quot;bed.&quot; A layer of wet seaweed is placed over the stones, followed by traditional regional foods such as steamers, mussels, quahogs, and lobsters. Sausages are sometimes cooked as well. Side dishes usually include corn on the cob, potatoes, carrots, and onions. Alternating layers of seaweed and food are piled on top, and the entire mound is covered with canvas that has been drenched in water to seal in the heat and prevent the canvas from burning. The food is allowed to steam for several hours.

Many locales outlaw building fires on beaches, and those that do often require permits. In order to accommodate the dish in homes or backyards, this dish is often prepared in a large pot in much smaller quantities. This is known as a New England clam boil. Some caterers specialize in clambakes on the beach.

Clambakes are also popular in Greater Cleveland, despite that region&#x27;s not being near the Atlantic Ocean. A typical clambake there includes a dozen clams with half a chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot. John D. Rockefeller started the tradition in Ohio.

==In popular culture==

The 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical Carousel featured a song called &quot;A Real Nice Clambake&quot;. The song was also in the 1956 film version. Hammerstein spent a lot of time researching in order to write the lyrics for the song. He consulted over 20 books and spoke to chefs, dialect experts and historians. The book that influenced him most was &quot;Mainstays of Maine&quot; by Pulitzer Prize winning poet Robert P. T. Coffin. The book included a full chapter about a clambake on a Maine island, with great culinary detail. Many of these details were incorporated into Hammerstein&#x27;s lyrics, including describing lapping up chowder &quot;with a clamshell,
tied onto a bayberry stick.&quot;

<text>Maidan is an originally Persian word for a town square or public gathering place (Persian: ), adopted by various other languages: Urdu (&quot;maidān&quot;); Arabic (&quot;maydān&quot;); Turkish ; Georgian (&quot;moedani&quot;); Bangla ময়দান, meaning field, and Crimean Tatar, from which Ukrainian also borrowed . Its ultimate source is Proto-Indo-European – compare Avestan , Sanskrit () and Latin . Various versions include &quot;maydan&quot;, &quot;midan&quot;, &quot;meydan&quot;, &quot;majdan&quot;, &quot;mayadeen&quot; and &quot;maydān&quot;. It also means field (मैदान) in Hindi. It became a loanword in other South Asian languages to give similar means, such as in Tamil in which the word is &quot;maidhanam&quot;.

The broad geographical footprint of the use of &quot;Maidan&quot; in toponymy, from Central Europe to South-East Asia, is a reflection of the Turkish rule in these areas.

<doc id="1001032" wikidata="Q7560663" url="?curid=1001032" title="Son of Sam law">
<text>A Son of Sam law (American English; also known as a notoriety-for-profit law) is a law designed to keep criminals from profiting from the publicity of their crimes; for instance, by selling their stories to publishers. Such laws often authorize the state to seize money earned from deals such as book/film biographies and paid interviews and use it to compensate the criminal&#x27;s victims. 

These laws have been criticized as violating the free-speech guarantee of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The original and namesake law from New York State was ruled unconstitutional on those grounds by the Supreme Court of the United States. New York and other states have since passed laws with similar goals that attempt to comply with the Court&#x27;s decision.

In certain cases, a Son of Sam law can be extended beyond the criminals themselves to include friends, neighbors, and family members of the lawbreaker who seek to profit by telling publishers and filmmakers of their relation to the criminal. In other cases, a person may not financially benefit from the sale of a story or any other mementos pertaining to the crime.

==History==
The term &quot;Son of Sam&quot; is derived from the first law of this type, targeted at serial killer David Berkowitz, who used the name &quot;Son of Sam&quot; during his notorious murder spree in mid-1970s New York City. After his arrest in August 1977, the intense media interest in the case led to widespread speculation that he might sell his story to a writer or filmmaker. Although Berkowitz denied wanting any kind of deal, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed preemptive legal statutes anyway, the first legal restriction of its kind in the U.S. The original New York law was invoked in New York eleven times between 1977 and 1990, including against Mark David Chapman, the murderer of musician John Lennon.

Critics argued that the law infringed on freedom of speech and therefore violated the First Amendment. Further they say that &quot;Son of Sam&quot; laws take away the financial incentive for many criminals to tell their stories, some of which (such as the Watergate scandal) were of vital interest to the general public.

In 1987, lawyers for publishing company Simon &amp; Schuster sued the New York authorities to prevent enforcement of the Son of Sam law with respect to a book they were about to publish called &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, written by Nicholas Pileggi. The book was about ex-mobster Henry Hill. It was adapted for the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. 

The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991. In an 8–0 ruling on &quot;Simon &amp; Schuster v. Crime Victims Board&quot;, the court ruled the law unconstitutional. The majority opinion was that the law was overinclusive, and would have prevented the publication of such works as &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, and even &quot;The Confessions of Saint Augustine&quot;.

Similarly, the state of California&#x27;s Son of Sam law was struck down in 2002 after being used against Barry Keenan, one of the men who kidnapped Frank Sinatra, Jr. in 1963.

After numerous revisions, New York adopted a new &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law in 2001. This law requires that victims of crimes be notified whenever a person convicted of a crime receives $10,000 (US) or more from virtually any source. The law attaches a springing statute of limitations, giving victims an extended period of time to sue the perpetrator of the crime in civil court for their crimes and to potentially receive damages. This law also authorizes a state agency, the Crime Victims&#x27; Board, to act on the victims&#x27; behalf in some limited circumstances. Thus far, this current New York law has survived court scrutiny, largely because profit is targeted instead of speech.

==Related concepts==
Regardless of whether a state has a formal Son of Sam law, victims and their families may use civil lawsuits for monetary damages that effectively preclude a wrongdoer (or accused wrongdoer) from profiting from their crime. A prominent example is the litigation between the family of Ron Goldman and O. J. Simpson following Simpson&#x27;s acquittal for Goldman&#x27;s murder. Goldman&#x27;s family won a wrongful death claim against Simpson for more than $30 million. When Simpson later published a book about the murder, &quot;If I Did It&quot;, a court awarded the book&#x27;s rights to the Goldman family to help satisfy the judgment.

In high-profile criminal cases and cases that are closely tied to national security, such as convictions for terrorism and espionage, a &quot;Son of Sam clause&quot; has been included in plea bargains. Examples include John Walker Lindh (an American who aided the Taliban in Afghanistan) and Harold James Nicholson (a Central Intelligence Agency officer who spied for Russia). As a result of their plea bargains, any and all profits made from book deals or movie rights would be turned over to the U.S. Treasury. Neither the convicts nor their families would be able to profit.

With the advent of the Internet and online sales, many Son of Sam laws are now targeting the sale of so-called &quot;murderabilia&quot;. Few courts have yet issued opinions regarding the constitutionality of many of these new laws.

Son of Sam laws are distinct from asset forfeiture, the seizing of assets acquired directly as a result of criminal activity. Where asset forfeiture intends to remove the profitability of crimes by taking away money and assets gained as proceeds from the crime, Son of Sam laws are designed so that criminals are unable to take advantage of the notoriety of their crimes.

<doc id="1001042" wikidata="Q5629619" url="?curid=1001042" title="HHead">
<text>hHead were a Canadian alternative rock band, formed in 1991 in Toronto.

==History==

===Origin story (1991 to 1992)===

The band was originally formed by Noah Mintz and Brendan Canning after the duo met as students at Brock University 

They were originally as an acoustic duo and played under the name The Happy. They eventually evolved into a harder rock band, echoing the grunge sounds of the early 1990s.

Mintz and Canning called their new band &quot;Head&quot; but soon added a second &quot;h&quot; after discovering that another band was already recording as Head, although both hHead and the Vancouver band Rymes with Orange regularly joked in promotional interviews that the extra &quot;h&quot; had been traded between the bands by either donation or theft.

The band employed a series of drummers during their career. This includes Mark Bartkiw, who previously played in Fancypants Hoodlum (a project led by Merrill Nisker, who&#x27;d later go on to perform as electroclash superstar Peaches).

===Career highlights (1993 to 1997)===

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fireman&quot;, was released independently in 1992. It became popular on Canadian campus radio, receiving wider distribution in 1993. 

hHead became a popular live act in Toronto, playing at such clubs as the Drake Hotel, Lee&#x27;s Palace and The Rivoli. At the latter, one performance saw a young Stone Temple Pilots open for hHead. This was STP&#x27;s first Toronto appearance.

hHead also toured Canada and the United States as both as a headliner in rock clubs and as an opening act for a wide range of artists. hHead opened shows for international acts like My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr., Letters to Cleo, Goo Goo Dolls, The Lemonheads and Stone Temple Pilots. hHead also played Canadian tours with The Tragically Hip, The Watchmen, Sloan and Eric&#x27;s Trip.

In 1993, the band won CFNY-FM&#x27;s Discovery to Disc contest, which awarded them $100,000 toward the recording of a new album. 

The band landed a contract with IRS Records in 1994, releasing their second album, &quot;Jerk&quot;, that year. The album was supported by a large-scale national tour as an opening act for Moist, and by an appearance on the Edgefest bill in 1995. However, IRS Records was at this point in financial trouble, and declared bankruptcy in 1996. 

The band then moved to the Canadian independent label Handsome Boy Records for their final album, &quot;Ozzy&quot; in 1996.

hHead played their final show at Edenfest in 1996 and the band broke up in 1997.

===Post breakup (1997 to present)===

Mintz is now a mastering engineer for artists such as Hayden, Broken Social Scene and The Dears, and has recorded solo material as Noah&#x27;s Arkweld. Leslie Feist was part of an early version of Noah&#x27;s Arkweld. 

In 2015, the previously unreleased track &quot;Fempire&quot; and a solo track by Canning titled &quot;Born from the Ashes&quot; appeared on Squirtgun Records&#x27; 20th anniversary &quot;Return of Our Stupid Noise&quot; compilation.

Canning joined By Divine Right for that band&#x27;s third album &quot;Bless This Mess&quot;, and later formed the bands Broken Social Scene with Kevin Drew and Cookie Duster with Bernard Maiezza. Broken Social Scene&#x27;s album &quot;Bee Hives&quot; includes a song titled &quot;hHallmark&quot;, alluding to the unique typography of hHead&#x27;s name.

<text>311 South Wacker Drive is a post-modern 65-story skyscraper located in Chicago, Illinois, and completed in 1990. At 961 feet (293 m) tall, it is the ninth-tallest building in Chicago and the 36th tallest in the United States. It was once the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world. 311 South Wacker was also the tallest building in the world known only by its street address, until it was surpassed in height by New York&#x27;s 432 Park Avenue in 2015.

The lower level of the winter garden was designed for a possible connection via underground passageway to Chicago Union Station. The building also contains three levels of underground parking. The building contains both retail and commercial tenants.

==Lobby==
The lobby is a two-level (one below ground) -tall glass-ceilinged &quot;winter garden.&quot; It used to have palm trees, still has a fountain, and is supported by a steel structure influenced by the Chicago &quot;L&quot; tracks and bridges. It was envisioned as a commuter link or &quot;pedestrian station&quot; serving as a connection from the nearby Union Station through a disused streetcar tunnel under the South Branch of the Chicago River. Raymond Kaskey&#x27;s bronze sculpture &quot;Gem of the Lakes&quot; looks over the garden from the Wacker entrance. The fountain shell form is taken from the city seal with a heroic figure representing Chicago as the &quot;city of broad shoulders&quot; wearing a cape symbolic of the great engineering feat which reversed the flow of Chicago River.

==Crown==

The top of the building is a -tall translucent cylinder, surrounded by four other smaller cylinders, which was inspired by the massing of the Tribune Tower. This makes it among the most visible Chicago skyscrapers at night, as its crown is brightly illuminated. The five cylinders on top are lit at night by 1,852 fluorescent tubes, and a lantern at the top changes colors for various holidays and special events.

==Park==
311 South Wacker is surrounded to the northwest by a grassy area, commonly used as a lounging and public lunch area during warm months, which is the largest area of green space in the Chicago Loop. This park is used to host local farmer markets, musical events, and various art and cultural festivals. To the southwest is a parking lot. This land was originally to be occupied by two companion towers that were never developed due to office market conditions.

<doc id="1001052" wikidata="Q8454226" url="?curid=1001052" title="Hurricane Iwa">
<text>Hurricane Iwa, taken from the Hawaiian language name for the frigatebird (iwa, lit. &quot;Thief&quot;), was at the time the costliest hurricane to affect the state of Hawaii. Iwa was the twenty-third tropical storm and the twelfth and final hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season. It developed from an active trough of low pressure near the equator on November 19. The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north. Iwa passed within 25 miles of the island of Kauai with peak winds of on November 23 (November 24 Coordinated Universal Time), and the next day it became extratropical to the northeast of the state.

The hurricane devastated the islands of Niihau, Kauai, and Oahu with wind gusts exceeding and rough seas exceeding in height. The first significant hurricane to hit the Hawaiian Islands since statehood in 1959, Iwa severely damaged or destroyed 2,345 buildings, including 1,927 houses, leaving 500 people homeless. Damage throughout the state totaled $312 million (1982 USD$,  USD). One person (Seaman Joseph Cantu of the U.S. Navy aboard the destroyer ship U.S.S. Goldsborough) was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane&#x27;s aftermath.

==Meteorological history==

A very active trough of low pressure persisted along the equator in the middle of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward.
Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Niño in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after turning to the north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.

Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Iwa turned and accelerated to the northeast in response to strong upper level flow to its north. The hurricane possessed sufficient moisture, instability, and upper divergence for continued intensification, and Iwa reached peak winds of late on November 23 while located southwest of Waimea on the island of Kauai. Its forward speed increased to 30 to 40 mph, and Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November 23 (November 24 in UTC). The right semicircle of the storm extended across Kauai and Oahu, with gusts from . After passing Hawaii, the convection of Iwa rapidly deteriorated as it gradually lost tropical characteristics. Late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and on November 25 Iwa became an extratropical cyclone while located about northeast of Hawaii.

== Impact ==

Hurricane Iwa produced estimated gusts reaching across Kauai and Oahu. The acceleration of the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near the path of the center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kauai. There, the surge reached inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. Waves on the coast of Oahu reached 16.4 feet in height (3 m), and waves on southern Kauai surpassed in height.

During the worst of the storm, 5,800 people were evacuated from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai&#x27;s oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 on the east side of the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island&#x27;s homes unlivable.

Rough seas killed a person on a Navy Destroyer the USS Goldsborough DDG-20 in Pearl Harbor when the seaman hit a stanchion, with four others injured on the ship. One of the four injured was swept overboard two miles (three kilometers) from the harbor. Before the arrival of the hurricane, around 1,000 evacuated the low-lying coastline to shelters.
Rough waves destroyed four and damaged two deep-water communication cables between Oahu and Kauai. In Oahu, damage from wind and surf was heaviest on the southwest coast between Nānākuli and Mākaha. The storm surge washed sand into streets in Waikīkī and flooded cars in areas of basement parking. Wind damage was greatest in areas where winds blew from southerly directions off of mountains. The winds damaged several small aircraft and a Douglas DC-3 plane in Honolulu. Gusty winds shattered glass windows in the Honolulu International Airport, injuring several passengers. Some flights in and out of the Honolulu airport were delayed, while other domestic airports were temporarily closed. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels, and two condominium buildings on the island. Additionally, 418 buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu.

Surf damage was reported throughout the Hawaiian islands. 120 people were treated for injuries, though most were minor. An estimated 500 people throughout Hawaii were left homeless due to the hurricane. Damage on the private island of Niihau was severe. An aerial survey indicated 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged, indicating that the hurricane affected nearly all of the island&#x27;s 226 residents. Reportedly no one was injured on Niihau. At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state of Hawaii, with damage totaling $312 million (1982 USD$,  USD).

The last female Kauaʻi ʻōʻō (&quot;Moho braccatus&quot;) was lost in the storm. Her mate was recorded singing in solitary until he went silent and presumably died in 1987, marking the extinction of their species.

==Aftermath==
Three days after Hurricane Iwa passed the state, Governor George Ariyoshi declared the islands of Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas and began filing papers for a federal disaster declaration. On November 28, five days after the hurricane struck, President Ronald Reagan declared the islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as a disaster area. The declaration allocated federal funds to aid the affected citizens. The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kauai indefinitely.

The thousands of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations to the thousands left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By three weeks after the hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. 

==Retirement==
In the spring of 1983, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Iwa&quot; from the Central Pacific lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced it with &quot;Io&quot;. However, in 2007, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center revised the name lists, and replaced the name &quot;Io&quot; with &quot;Iona&quot; before it could be used. Iwa was the first name retired in the basin following implementation of the modern system of Central Pacific tropical storm naming.

<text>Deram Records was a subsidiary record label of Decca Records established in the United Kingdom in 1966. At the time, U.K. Decca was a different company from the Decca label in the United States, which was owned by MCA Inc. Deram recordings were distributed in the U.S. through UK Decca&#x27;s American branch known as London Records. Deram was active until 1979, then continued as a reissue label.

==History==
===1966–1968===
In the 1960s Decca recording engineers experimented with ways of improving stereo recordings. They created a technique they named &quot;Decca Panoramic Sound.&quot; The term &quot;Deramic&quot; was created as abbreviation of this. The new concept &quot;allowed for more space between instruments, rendering these sounds softer to the ear.&quot; Early stereo recordings of popular music usually were mixed with sounds to the hard left, centre, or hard right only. This was because of the technical limitations of the professional 4-track reel-to-reel recorders which were considered state of the art until 1967.

Decca initially conceived Deram Records as an outlet for Deramic Sound recordings of contemporary pop and rock music, however, not all of the early recordings on Deram used this technique. &#x27;Deramic Sound&#x27; was intended to create recordings that had a more natural stereo spread. The basic difference was that, instead of overdubbing and mixing four individual (mono) tracks from a four-track recorder, the Decca recording engineers used a pair of four-track machines to layer multiple two-channel (stereo) recordings. This new concept, with additional tracks, permitted the engineer to place instruments more easily in any position within the stereo field.

To launch the &#x27;Deramic Sound&#x27; concept Deram issued a series of six easy listening orchestral pop albums in October 1967. The albums all included the word &quot;Night&quot; in the title, i.e. &quot;Strings in the Night&quot;, &quot;Brass in the Night&quot;, etc. Artists in this series included Gordon Franks, Peter Knight, and Tony Osborne. The label was soon reinvented as a rival to early pre-punk &#x27;indie&#x27; record companies like Island Records and moulded into a home for &#x27;progressive&#x27; or &#x27;psychedelic&#x27; artists. Among the first recordings in this series was the November 1967 album release &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; by the Moody Blues, while Crocheted Doughnut Ring and Beverley Martyn were also signed to the label around this time.

Professional eight-track recorders began to appear in many British studios starting with Advision Studios and Trident Studios in early 1968. The eight-track machines were far more flexible than the dual four-track recorder setup. By 1969 Decca had obtained its own eight-track recorder. Since Decca engineers no longer had more tracks than other major studios the &#x27;Deramic Sound&#x27; concept quickly became outdated and was dropped.

===1969–1982===
The roster later included British jazz and folk. Some of the more progressive jazz musicians of the late 1960s were released under the Deram imprint, including Mike Gibbs, John Surman, and Mike Westbrook. Deram albums bore a DML prefix for mono and an SML prefix for stereo releases. As with other UK Decca subsidiary labels, Deram&#x27;s U.S. counterpart was distributed under London Records. Decca positioned it against Island Records, Harvest Records (started by EMI), and Vertigo Records (started by Philips Records), but it failed to compete. An &#x27;extra&#x27; progressive series with SDL prefixes did not improve the situation.

From the start, Decca placed pop records next to progressive artists on Deram. Cat Stevens found early success there before moving to Island Records, and David Bowie&#x27;s first album appeared on the label. Three of Deram&#x27;s earliest hits, Procol Harum&#x27;s &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and the Move&#x27;s &quot;Night of Fear&quot; and &quot;I Can Hear the Grass Grow&quot;, were produced outside the company by artists not directly signed to Deram. They were part of a deal with Straight Ahead Productions, who later moved their acts to EMI and had them released on the re-introduced Regal Zonophone imprint.

In 1969, Decca launched Nova, a progressive label that lasted less than a year. This caused further confusion as simultaneous releases on Deram Nova and Decca Nova appeared. Decca released Justin Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Songwriter&quot; (1977) and &quot;Night Flight&quot; (1980) vinyl albums on Deram. In 1980, Sir Edward Lewis sold Decca to PolyGram, which put its new acquisition under the control of Roger Ames.
Even though the label name was briefly used in the early 1980s for records by Bananarama, the Mo-dettes, and Splodgenessabounds, Ames decided to focus on Decca (for classical music) and London Recordings (for pop music), with London run as his own &#x27;semi-autonomous indie&#x27; from within the major. From this point Deram was used as a reissue imprint for other recordings in the Decca/London catalogue and was eventually sold to Universal/UMG as part of Decca Records (London went with Ames to WMG, who sold it to French indie Because Music in 2017)

<text>George Edgar Abecassis (21 March 1913 – 18 December 1991) was a British racing driver, and co-founder of the HWM Formula One team.

==Pre-1946 career==
Born in Oatlands, Surrey, Abecassis was educated at Clifton College. He began circuit racing in 1935 in a modified Austin Seven which became known as &quot;The Einsitzer&quot;. After taking 1937 as a year away from the track, he acquired an Alta and made a name for himself in English national racing during the 1938 and 1939 seasons. In 1939, he won the Imperial Trophy Formula Libre race at Crystal Palace, driving his Alta, defeating Prince Bira, in the E.R.A. known as &quot;Romulus&quot;, in a wet race, &quot;that being the only time it was beaten by a car in the British Isles.&quot;

At one point, Abecassis held the Campbell circuit lap record at Brooklands at On 3 July 1938 Abecassis broke the Prescott Hill Climb record with a climb of 47.85 seconds in his supercharged 1½-litre Alta.

When World War II broke out he joined the Royal Air Force, as a member of the Volunteer Reserves, and became an experienced pilot, ultimately becoming a member of the secret &quot;Moon Squadrons&quot;, ferrying secret agents in and out of occupied countries in Europe with specially-modified Halifax and Stirling aircraft. During the course of his wartime service Abecassis was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and was mentioned in dispatches with the following citation:
Abecassis achieved the rank of squadron leader, and, following the war, continued as a member of the RAF Volunteer Reserves prior to his discharge in 1953.

==Post-1946 career==

After World War II Abecassis went back to racing, initially with pre-war machinery. He won a race at Gransden Lodge in a road-going 3.3-litre Bugatti on 15 June 1946. In 1947, Abecassis finished second in the Swedish Grand Prix, held on a frozen lake at Vallentuna, driving an E.R.A. In 1948, he finished second to Bob Gerard in the Jersey International Road Race. He became a partner, with John Heath, in Hersham and Walton Motors Ltd., a motor dealership and garage in Walton-on-Thames. Building on his pre-war association with the Alta marque, Abecassis and HWM assisted in the development of the Alta GP car, designed to comply with the recently introduced Formula One regulations.

After the failure of this enterprise, Abecassis and Heath decided to construct their own cars under the HWM banner, but retaining Alta engines. Initially the HWM cars were designed to compete in the Formula Two class, but when the World Championship switched to Formula Two regulations in HWM cars became eligible to compete in the Grand Prix events. During their prime, HWM employed such future stars as Stirling Moss and Peter Collins, and the Belgian Johnny Claes scored their first victory, in the Grand Prix des Frontières at a street circuit in Chimay, Belgium. Abecassis&#x27;s HWM team also took a notable victory in the International Trophy race at Silverstone in 1952, this time with Lance Macklin at the wheel. With the reintroduction of Formula One cars to the World Championship in , Abecassis and Heath attempted to produce a competitive car using the 2.5-litre version of the Alta engine but it was not a success; HWM cars only contested two further Grand Prix events after 1953.

It was with his own HWM cars that Abecassis raced in his only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, at the Bremgarten circuit, in the 1951 and 1952 Swiss Grand Prix. He was more successful as a sports car driver with Aston Martin and won his class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in , sharing his DB2 with Macklin. He also finished second in the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1953, partnered by Reg Parnell. In 1953, Abecassis constructed an HWM sports car for his own personal use, powered by a Jaguar straight-6 engine, with which he successfully contested many national British races until 1956.

In 1955 Mille Miglia he drove a red Austin Healey 100S (AHS3804) very fast in the last &quot;Rome section&quot; to an outstanding position close to the speeds of Stirling Moss with the Mercedes SLR and finished 11th overall.

In 1956, Heath was killed in an accident in the Mille Miglia and Abecassis retired from racing, turning his attention to running the HWM operations. He was the Facel Vega importer for Britain, while his motor industry connections were aided by the fact that he was married to Angela, the daughter of Aston Martin chairman Sir David Brown. He died aged 78, in Ibstone, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

In September 2010 his son David Abecassis published a comprehensive biography of his father under the title &quot;A Passion for Speed&quot;.

His grandson, Jonathan Abecassis, has an active interest in vintage sports car racing. He competes in the Fifties Sports Car Racing Club (&quot;FISCAR&quot;) series, driving an Austin Healey 100/4.

<doc id="1001083" wikidata="Q1353816" url="?curid=1001083" title="Maxim Berezovsky">
<text>Maxim Sozontovich Berezovsky ( ; ; ) was a composer of secular and liturgical music, and a conductor and opera singer, who worked at the Saint Petersburg Court Chapel in the Russian Empire, but who also spent much of his career in Italy. He made an important contribution in the music of Ukraine. Together with Artemy Vedel and Dmitry Bortniansky, both of whom have cited him as an influence, Berezovsky is considered by musicologists as one of the three great composers of 18th-century Ukrainian classical music, and one of Russia&#x27;s first composers.

Berezovsky&#x27;s place of birth and his father&#x27;s name are known only from verbal accounts. He is traditionally thought to have been educated at the ; he may have also attended the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, although this is uncertain. In 1758, he was accepted as a singer into the capella at Oranienbaum, before being employed at the imperial court of Catherine II in Saint Petersburg, where he received lessons from the Italian composer Baldassare Galuppi. In 1769, Berezovsky was sent to study in Bologna. There he composed secular works, including &quot;Demofonte&quot;, a three-act opera seria that was the earliest Italian-style opera to be written by a Ukrainian or a Russian composer. He returned to Saint Petersburg in October 1773. The circumstances of his death in 1777 are not documented. 

Berezovsky is best known for his choral works, and was one of the creators of the Ukrainian sacred choral style. Few of his compositions are extant, but research in recent decades led to the rediscovery of previously lost works, including three symphonies. His opera and violin sonata were the first known examples of these genres by an Imperial Russian composer.

==Biography==
A lack of documentary evidence meant that little was known about Maxim Sozontovich Berezovsky until the 21st century. During the 1830s and 1840s, the librarians of the St. Petersburg State Academic Capella compiled details about his life and work. They had access to the composer&#x27;s own scores and notes, but relied on anecdotal information from others who remembered him. The earliest writers to produce short biographies of Berezovsky were the German historiographer , the antiquary and book collector Eugene Bolkhovitinov, and the Russian poet and translator Nikolai Dmitrievich Gorchakov. Bolkhovitinov&#x27;s unsubstantiated biography, written decades after Berezovsky&#x27;s death, was used by later writers as the main source of information about the composer. Unconfirmed details still included in modern biographies include that he was a victim of his circumstances who was driven to suicide, either by debt or the lack of recognition of his creative genius.

===Early life===
Berezovsky&#x27;s father may have belonged to the petty nobility. Contemporary descendants of a brother, Pavel, associate the family&#x27;s origins with the Cossacks. The family&#x27;s coat of arms has also been preserved, testifying to its Polish origins.
Berezovsky&#x27;s place of birth, father&#x27;s name, and supposed period as a scholar at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in Kyiv, are known only from verbal accounts, and so are not known for certain. Once-accepted aspects of his life story originate from a largely fictional play by Peter Smirnov, written in 1841, as well as from a novel written in 1844 by the Russian writer Nestor Kukolnik.

It was in the past believed that Berezovsky was born on , as recalled by a teacher in the Capella in Saint Petersburg. Other 19th-century sources cite different years: 1743, 1742, and even 1725. Since being stated by an encyclopedic dictionary, published in 1836, that Berezovsky was born in around 1745, this year has become the accepted year of his birth. The month and the day of his birth appeared in works by and respectively. It is unclear where their information originated from.

Berezovsky&#x27;s birthplace is unknown for certain, but according to many sources was Hlukhiv, at that time the main residence of the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host. During the 18th century, Hlukhiv served as the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate and the administrative centre of the Little Russia Governorate.

===Education in Hlukhiv and Kyiv===
During the 18th century, as choirs arose in Ukrainian churches, monasteries and schools, composers and singers raised choral music to a high artistic and professional level. In contrast to the Italian practice of employing castrati, the all-male Capella used boy sopranos. Ukraine became known as a place to recruit boys with excellent singing voices, and from the 1730s, Russian nobles brought talented youngsters from the region with them to perform at the Capella. From 1738, the was used by the Capella to provide boys with their initial training, before those that were selected were coached as singers at the court in Saint Petersburg. When their voices changed, those with the best voices were then trained as adult singers, and freed if they were serfs. Those not selected generally found work as government employees, or choristers in monasteries.

Berezovsky is generally considered to have been a boy chorister at the school in Hlukhiv. His name does not appear in surviving documents of this institution, but as it was the only one in the Russian Empire that trained singers for the Imperial Court Choir, it is likely that he was educated there, as were other composers such as Artemy Vedel, Hryhorii Skovoroda, and . He may have composed three- and four-part motets as a boy.

It was asserted by some 19th-century sources that Berezovsky received part of his education at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, but when the academy&#x27;s documents were made public at the start of the 20th century, Berezovsky&#x27;s name was not found amongst any of the student lists. There is no documentary confirmation of Berezovsky attending the academy.

===Oranienbaum, and Saint Petersburg===

On 29 June 1758, Berezovsky was accepted as a singer into the capella of the future Paul I of Russia, in Oranienbaum, near Saint Petersburg. There he sang in Italian operas and his name appears in printed librettos of the operas (1759) by Francesco Araja (when he played the role of Poro) and (1760) by Vincenzo Manfredini (when he portrayed Ircano). Some 1756 salary receipts are preserved, signed by &quot;Beresevsky&quot;, that confirm that he was a paid as an opera singer at the Oranienbaum.

The future governor of Little Russia, Pyotr Rumyantsev, brought the 13-year-old Berezovsky to the royal court. He was employed at the court for 19 years, as an opera singer (until 1765), a musician in the orchestra (from 1766) and a composer (from 1774). In 1762, he became a singer of the Italian Saint Petersburg Court Capella. He was taught to compose and play the harpsichord by the Italian conductor Francesco Tsoppis, and was taught composing by the Italian composer Baldassare Galuppi. Berezovsky surprised Tsoppis when he created a series of well-written choral concerts. With Dmitry Bortniansky, he took part in a performance of Hermann Raupach&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot; in Saint Petersburg.

During the 1760s, Berezovsky was a court staff-musician and composed concertos for church choirs. Influenced by the sacred concertos created by Italians at court, Berezovsky&#x27;s new music in the Italian style was well received. He no longer sang as a principal after Catherine II became empress in 1762, perhaps because of his age, or because Russian musicians lost favour at court during her rule.

====Married life====
In 1763, at the age of 18, Berezovsky married a girl he had known since his days at Oranienbaum, a court ballerina named Franzina Uberscher, who was the daughter of one of the court orchestra&#x27;s horn players. Berezovsky belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church, and Franzina was a Roman Catholic, so permission had to be sought for the marriage. Having worked for 11 years as a dancer in the court theatre, in 1774, she was dismissed due to her age.

According to the conductor musicologist , Berezovsky had another wife named Nadiya Matviivna, but the Ukrainian musicologist Olga Shumilina asserts that Franzina changed her name when she married into the Orthodox Church.

It is not known for certain why, shortly after Berezovsky&#x27;s death, a court employee received a payment from the imperial treasury that would normally have been given to his wife, who was still alive. A year after her husband&#x27;s death, Nadiya Matviivna, left without means of subsistence, died in poverty. The death certificate, dated 1 January 1778, named her as the wife of Berezovsky, a chamber orchestra musician.

===First Italian trip===
It is unclear exactly when or how often Berezovsky went to Italy, but there is evidence he may travelled there more than once. An imperial document exists concerning two passports issued on 26 August 1764 to persons from Little Russia sent to Italy at the private expense of Kirill Razumovsky, the last Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host. One of the passports is thought to have been for Berezovsky. Razumovsky had taken him from Hlukhiv to St. Petersburg in late 1757. He acted as his mentor, and assisted him financially. The passport document read: &quot;In Little Russia to Kyiv to the Little Russian nobleman Maxim Berezevsky and the merchant Ivan Konstantinov, sent by His Eminence Hetman Count Razumovsky to Italy&quot;. The indication that Berezovsky was a nobleman reveals that he probably had certain privileges, and a good salary. Shumilina states that the passport may not have been for Berezovsky, as the name &quot;Beresevsky&quot; is not the same as &quot;Berezovsky&quot;.

After his return from Italy, Berezovsky was hired as the deputy director of the Capella, with an annual salary of 500 rubles. His duties included writing operatic ballet music. This position is shown in a list of theatre employees that was made in 1766. His sacred choral concerts was performed in August 1766 in the Amber Room of the Tsarskoye Selo Palace in the presence of Catherine II. Five more concerts were written during the next two years and were praised by Italian musicians (including Galuppi) and courtiers alike.

===Return to Italy===

In 1769, Berezovsky, by then in his late twenties, made a return trip to Italy. He travelled first to Vienna, as a courier to the ambassador Dmytro Golitsyn, as stated in a border crossing document dated 26 May. From there he went to Bologna. There he studied with the composer Giovanni Battista Martini at the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. He stayed in Italy until 1773.

Berezovsky did not have the necessary letter of introduction for Martini. The letter was sent to Martini in February 1770 by the director of the Russian imperial theatres, Ivan Yelagin, by which time Berezovsky was already in Bologna and had begun classes. Shumilina has proposed that the appearance of Berezovsky in Italy (at a time when Russia and the Ottoman Empire were at war) was not initially so that he could be taught by Martini, and that the Russian authorities used Berezovsky&#x27;s tuition as a cover, so that he could act as a government agent.

In May 1771, Berezovsky formally requested to be allowed to take the graduation exam:

Along with fellow graduate Josef Mysliveček, Berezowsky had to compose a polyphonic work on a given theme. This was a similar exam to the one given to the 14-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart a year earlier. Academicians gathered to test the applicants, who assessed the candidates&#x27; examination pieces by secret ballot, using white and black balls to vote that the required standard had been reached. Unusually, both Mysliveček and Berezovsky received only white balls—which signified a positive vote—and so both became academicians. This brought them financial and social benefits. Berezowsky&#x27;s examination piece, , signed &quot;Massimo Berezovsky&quot;, is now kept by the academy. Berezovsky&#x27;s compositions in Italy include &quot;Demofonte&quot;, a three-act &quot;opera seria&quot;, with an Italian libretto by Pietro Metastasio. It was staged in Livorno and premiered in February 1773. The music he composed in Italy had to be published in France, as during his lifetime, neither Russia or Italy regularly published printed music. Berezovsky became the first Russian member of the Academia Filarmonica di Bologna.

===Return to Saint Petersburg===
Having run out of funds, Berezovsky returned to Saint Petersburg in October 1773, and was put in charge of the choir in which he had been trained. His allowance for his years in Italy was paid only in 1774, upon his return to Russia.

As his duties involved writing and performing music, Berezovsky is referred to as a composer in some documents. However, no compositions or records of his employment at court from this period have survived. It is probable that he had no permanent position, and that following his return from Italy, his composing career effectively stopped. He was never promoted again.

===Death===

Berezovsky received his last salary in February 1777. The Russian statesman Grigory Potemkin invited him to work as the director of a music academy in Kremenchuk (now in modern Ukraine), but on 24 March (2 April N.S.) 1777, Berezovsky died in Saint Petersburg.

Over time, the details of Berezovsky&#x27;s death were embellished, for instance relating that he became alcoholic, and committed suicide. No records to indicate that he died by this means are known. He is finally mentioned after his death, when the issue of his estate is discussed: &quot;Composer Maxim Berezovsky died on the 24th day of this month; The salary he was owed is due to be paid, but since there is nothing left after his death, and there is nothing to bury the body, then please, your highness, give his salary to the court singer Yakov Timchenko...&quot; According to &quot;Muzyka&quot; and &quot;The Day&quot;, the story that Catherine II secretly ordered the papers in Berezovsky&#x27;s rooms to be burnt after his death are among the &quot;myths and legends&quot; surrounding his biography.

Bolkhovitinov wrote in his 1804 biography of Berezovsky that &quot;hypochondria&quot; caused Berezovsky to &quot;stab himself to death&quot;. His suicide, taken as fact from the early 19th century, may have happened because of debt problems, as opposed to earlier theories such as his supposed poor treatment by the imperial court. According to the Russian and Israeli musicologist , Berezovsky died of a fever.

== Works==
Most of Berezovsky&#x27;s compositions are lost. Of the 18 choral concertos he wrote, three are extant, of which only one autograph score, the antiphony he wrote during his exam for election to the Academy of Music, is known. Of the 40 choral works recorded during the 19th century, approximately half have been lost.

In 1901, the music encyclopedia Riemann Musiklexikon referred to &quot;not only the &quot;Demofonte&quot; opera, but also other secular works&quot; by the composer that had been written in Italy. The description of Berezovsky as a composer of sacred music who occasionally produced secular works has since been challenged by some modern scholars. His opera &quot;Demofonte&quot; and his violin sonata are the first examples of these genres by either a Ukrainian or a Russian composer.

===Sacred music===
Berezovsky became famous for his choral works. The style of his choral concertos influenced later composers such as Bortniansky and Vedel. His most well-known choral works are the concerto &quot;&quot; (&quot;Do Not Forsake Me in My Old Age&quot;), considered by musicologists to be his last composition, liturgical music for the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and the Credo, and four communion hymns: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Chalice of Salvation&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;In Eternal Memory&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;Let the Angels Create&quot;), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Over All the Land&quot;). They are related to Ukrainian folk songs and to the tradition of Kievan chant. &quot;Do Not Forsake Me in My Old Age&quot; was first published in 1817. It is sung regularly by Russian and Ukrainian choirs. Some of Berezovsky&#x27;s communion hymns are lost, and it is possible that of those that are extant, some were not composed by him.

Berezovsky was one of the creators of the Ukrainian choral style in sacred music, and the first composer to divide the Orthodox Liturgy into seven parts, providing each of them with a distinctive role. His settings are notable for their expressive melodies, which contain hints of Ukrainian folk songs. He originated the use of the folk tradition of homophonic choral recitation in the genre.

Lidiya Korniy writes that Berezovsky raised the genre of sacred concertos to the highest musical and artistic level. According to Yurchenko, the quality of some of Berezovsky&#x27;s liturgical works is &quot;unparalleled not only in Ukrainian but in European music&quot;. Prior to 2018, three choral concertos were attributed to Berezovsky, written during his second period in Saint Petersburg. Berezovsky created the four-movement classical choral concerto. 

In 2001, some of Berezovsky&#x27;s choral works were found in Kyiv, where following the end of World War II they had been placed in the care of the Kyiv Conservatory, before being moved to the . In 2018, a volume of newly discovered choral concerti by Berezovsky, nine for four voices, and three for double-choir, were published, nearly all for the first time.

===Secular music===
====&quot;Demofonte&quot;====
Berezovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Demofonte&quot; was commissioned and paid for by the Russian statesman Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov, who was stationed with his squadron in Livorno. The opera was staged during the town&#x27;s annual carnival in February 1773, and was well received.

Four arias, discovered in a music library in Florence, have survived: , , , and . The two arias each for Demophoön (tenor) and Timanthes (castrato)—were in a copyist&#x27;s score. Timanthes&#x27; arias, and , contain da capo sections in the style of Niccolò Jommelli. Their quality testifies to the composer&#x27;s experience of the opera seria genre.

The opera was performed both in Livorno and Florence, according to two accounts of productions found in &quot;Notizie del mondo&quot; published in Livorno on 27 February 1773. They show that &quot;Demofonte&quot; was performed as part of Livorno&#x27;s town carnival, as well as in a Florentine theatre. An entry listing the opera was also found in the Milanese &quot;Index of Theatre Performances for 1773&quot;.

The autograph manuscripts from &quot;Demofonte&quot; are held in the library of the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini. Sergei Diaghilev, the founder of the Ballets Russes, was prevented from reviving the opera, as so much was lost.

====Violin sonata====
Berezovsky&#x27;s symphony in C major and the sonata for violin and harpsichord in C major both have a cyclical structure and are written in an early sonata form, a musical style that is positioned somewhere between the Baroque and Classical styles of music.

The sonata (1772), composed when he was in Pisa, contains both Italian and Ukrainian elements. The influence of Ukrainian folk songs is found in the second movement, and the work incorporates the melody to a traditional folk song, &quot;The Cossack Rode beyond the Danube&quot;. The complexity of the violin part shows that Berezovsky was able to play the instrument at a professional level.

The piece consists of three movements:

The manuscript score, along with many other culturally important documents and objects, was taken by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army to Paris. In 1974, the work was mentioned in an account of Berezovsky&#x27;s life by the musicologist . The manuscript of the sonata was obtained from the Bibliothèque nationale de France (code D 11688), and published in Kyiv by the Ukrainian composer Mykhailo Stepanenko. Its first performance, with Stepanenko accompanying the violinist Alexander Panov, took place on 26 May 1981 at the Kyiv Conservatory (now the Ukrainian National Tchaikovsky Academy of Music).

In the early 2000s, a manuscript entitled was found in the library of the Czartoryski Museum by the Ukrainian academic . The attribution to Berezovsky was confirmed by Shulgina and experts at the National Library of Poland, who analysed the handwriting and demonstrated that the sonatas were written out by one person. A comparison of the sonatas with Berezovsky&#x27;s surviving autograph of the antiphon he wrote as an examination piece in 1771 shows that manuscript was written by a copyist. In 2014, the works were reattributed as being of Czech origin, when the composers were identified as being Kauchlitz Colizzi, Johann Baptist Wanhal, and probably the clarinettist Joseph Beer.

====Symphony in C major====
The article &quot;Symphony: 18th century&quot; of the 1980 edition of the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; noted that &quot;many Italian overtures have found their way into Russian libraries; and Berezovsky&#x27;s Russian symphony/overture has been preserved in the Doria Pamphilj collection in Rome.&quot; It is the earliest symphony known to be written by a Russian composer.

In 1996, an article in &quot;&quot; was the first to report the existence of a symphony by Berezovsky. The work, in C major, and named on the first page as , was discovered by the American conductor Steven Fox in 2002. Fox found a manuscript of the score in the music collection of an Italian aristocratic family, and was given permission for the work to be performed. The manuscript of the work is held in the , in Rome. It is hand-bound within the penultimate volume—&quot;XXX&quot;—along with five symphonies by other composers. Berezovsky&#x27;s symphony was written out in parts, as most symphonies in the 18th century were published, but rather in the form of a full score.

Shumilina has suggested the possibility that the symphony was an overture to Berezovsky&#x27;s opera and not a separate orchestral work. It was first performed by the early music orchestra Pratum Integrum in 2003, at the Royal Academy of Music in London. It was first played in Ukraine in 2016.

====Symphonies by &quot;Beresciollo&quot;====
Two symphonies that are likely to have been composed by Berezovsky—in C major and G major (named on the scores as XIII and XI respectively)—have since been found in Paris. The works were composed by an otherwise unknown man named Beresciollo. Published in 1760 in Paris, copies are now known to exist found in a number of European libraries. Certain themes in Beresciollo&#x27;s Symphony in G major have an affinity with Ukrainian folk music. They were performed for the first time in 2020 by the , conducted by Karabits.

It was announced that the works were composed by Berezovsky in Kyiv in 1995, during the celebrations of the composer&#x27;s 250th birthday. Berezovsky was a foreigner in Italy, and so was titled as . His surname may have been written differently because of errors in transcribing the handwritten transcription of his name from the Russian, which would not have been easy for the West Europeans to read.

==Legacy==
A monument to Berezovsky was installed in Hlukhiv, and his name is engraved in gold on a slab on the wall of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna, besides the name of Mozart. Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Nostalghia&quot; is inspired by the life of Berezovsky. The 275th anniversary of Berezovsky&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 2020.

Kirill Karabits, who conducted the Ukrainian premiere of Berezovsky&#x27;s Symphony No.1, has said that both Russia and Ukraine have equal claim to the composer&#x27;s legacy, saying that &quot;Russians have the right to call Berezovsky &#x27;Russian&#x27; and [Ukrainians] have a right to call him &#x27;Ukrainian.&#x27;&quot;

===Recovered scores===
After his death, Berezovsky&#x27;s music was largely forgotten, until the middle of the 19th century, when it was once again performed. The interest this created led to more research on the composer being undertaken. Analysis of his music ceased during the Russian Revolution, when more of his music was lost. Since the 1950s, previously lost works by Berezovsky have been discovered, performed again, and recorded for the first time, and his music has since been actively promoted. 

In 1998, the musicologist Christoph Wolff found six volumes of manuscripts containing 28 anonymous choral works composed by Berezovsky or Galuppi. Included are nearly all of Berezovsky&#x27;s concerts published and known at the time, his liturgy, a communion hymn, and works that were previously considered lost. The documents, originally from the Library of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, had been taken to Kyiv by the Red Army after World War II, the most important finds (about a fifth) going to Moscow. The manuscripts, which had been stored and catalogued at the Kyiv Conservatory by the Soviets, were gifted to Germany by the Ukrainian government. In exchange, Germany gave manuscripts of Ukrainian composers to Ukraine. Among these were works by Berezovsky.

<text>Ethanolamine (2-aminoethanol, monoethanolamine, ETA, or MEA) is a naturally occurring organic chemical compound with the formula or . The molecule is bifunctional, containing both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. Ethanolamine is a colorless, viscous liquid with an odor reminiscent of ammonia.

Ethanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA). The ethanolamines comprise a group of amino alcohols. A class of antihistamines is identified as ethanolamines, which includes carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, chlorphenoxamine, diphenhydramine and doxylamine.

== History ==
Ethanolamines, or in particular, their salts, were discovered by Charles Adolphe Wurtz in 1860 by heating 2-chloroethanol with ammonia solution while studying derivatives of ethylene oxide he discovered a year earlier. He wasn&#x27;t able to separate the salts or isolate any free bases.

In 1897 Ludwig Knorr developed the modern industrial route (see below) and separated the products, including MEA, by fractional distillation, for the first time studying their properties.

None of the ethanolamines were of any commercial importance until after the WWII industrial production of ethylene oxide took off.

==Occurrence in nature==
MEA molecules are a component in the formation of cellular membranes and are thus a molecular building block for life. Ethanolamine is the second-most-abundant head group for phospholipids, substances found in biological membranes (particularly those of prokaryotes); e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine. It is also used in messenger molecules such as palmitoylethanolamide, which has an effect on CB1 receptors.

MEA was thought to exist only on Earth and on certain asteroids, but in 2021 evidence was found that these molecules exist in interstellar space. 

Ethanolamine is biosynthesized by decarboxylation of serine:

Derivatives of ethanolamine are widespread in nature; e.g., lipids, as precursor of a variety of &quot;N&quot;-acylethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant–pathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering, as well as precursor, combined with arachidonic acid 20:4, ω-6), to form the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA: ; 20:4, ω-6).

MEA is biodegraded by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, a B12-dependent enzyme. It is converted to acetaldehyde and ammonia via initial H-atom abstraction.

==Industrial production==
Monoethanolamine is produced by treating ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia; the reaction also produces diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by the stoichiometry of the reactants.

==Applications==
MEA is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates.

For example, reacting ethanolamine with ammonia gives ethylenediamine, a precursor of the commonly used chelating agent, EDTA.

===Gas stream scrubbing===

Monoethanolamines can scrub combusted-coal, combusted-methane and combusted-biogas flue emissions of carbon dioxide () very efficiently. MEA carbon dioxide scrubbing is also used to regenerate the air on submarines.

Solutions of MEA in water are used as a gas stream scrubbing liquid in amine treaters. For example, aqueous MEA is used to remove carbon dioxide () and hydrogen sulfide () from various gas streams; e.g., flue gas and sour natural gas. The MEA ionizes dissolved acidic compounds, making them polar and considerably more soluble.

MEA scrubbing solutions can be recycled through a regeneration unit. When heated, MEA, being a rather weak base, will release dissolved or gas resulting in a pure MEA solution.

===Other uses===
In pharmaceutical formulations, MEA is used primarily for buffering or preparation of emulsions. MEA can be used as pH regulator in cosmetics.

It is an injectable sclerosant as a treatment option of symptomatic hemorrhoids. 2–5 ml of ethanolamine oleate can be injected into the mucosa just above the hemorrhoids to cause ulceration and mucosal fixation thus preventing hemorrhoids from descending out of the anal canal.

It is also an ingredient in cleaning fluid for automobile windshields.

===pH-control amine===
Ethanolamine is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. ETA (or sometimes a similar organic amine; e.g., morpholine) is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. In such application, ETA is a key ingredient of so-called &quot;all-volatile treatment&quot; of water (AVT).

== Reactions ==
Upon reaction with carbon dioxide, 2 equivalents of ethanolamine react through the intermediacy of carbonic acid to form a carbamate salt, which when heated usually reforms back to ethanolamine and carbon dioxide but occasionally can also cyclizate to 2-oxazolidone, generating amine gas treatment wastes.

<text>USS &quot;Kephart&quot; (DE-207/APD-61) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1947. After spending 20 years in reserve, she was transferred to Republic of Korea Navy and served another 18 years as &quot;Kyong Puk&quot; (PF-82) until she was struck in 1985.

==Namesake==

William Perry Kephart was born on 9 September 1915 in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 15 August 1937 and was appointed Aviation Cadet 3 months later. After flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. He was commissioned Ensign on 1 December 1938.

Kephart served with air groups on the and , and in May 1940 returned to Pensacola as a flight instructor. Six months later he rejoined Scouting Squadron 71 (VS-71) on board &quot;Wasp&quot;. Promoted to Lieutenant (j.g.) 15 June 1942 and Lieutenant (temporary) 1 October. 

His squadron was performing a scouting mission on 15 September when the Wasp was hit. Finding it ablaze upon returning, he and the remainder of his squadron landed on the . Kephart and six other pilots were sent to Guadalcanal on 4 October. In the early morning of 14 October, the dugout he was sheltering in received a direct hit during a heavy Japanese naval bombardment and he lost his life along with his Squadron Commander, Executive Officer, and a recently arrived Flight Officer of a Marine squadron.

==History==
&quot;Kephart&quot; was launched on 6 September 1943 at the Charleston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. A. P. Kephart, Lt. Kephart&#x27;s mother, and commissioned on 7 January 1944.

===Battle of the Atlantic===
After shakedown off Bermuda, &quot;Kephart&quot; departed New York on 23 March for convoy escort duty in the Atlantic. During the next three months, she made three runs from New York to Gibraltar and Bizerte, Tunisia. Returning to New York on 30 June for conversion to a &quot;Charles Lawrence&quot;-class high speed transport, she was reclassified APD-61 on 5 July.

=== Pacific War ===
&quot;Kephart&quot; departed New York on 30 September and joined the 7th Fleet at Hollandia, New Guinea, on 10 November. As a unit of TransDiv 103, she departed in convoy on 17 November and arrived at Leyte Gulf, Philippines, on 24 November. After a run to the Palaus, she embarked troops of the 77th Infantry Division at Leyte, and steamed on 6 December with Task Group 78.3 for amphibious assault at Ormoc Bay. During landing operations on 7 December, &quot;Kephart&quot;″s guns splashed two Japanese planes in a fierce raid. Returning to Leyte on 8 December, she embarked soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment; she sailed on 12 December for Mindoro, and landed assault troops at San Jose on 15 December, again under heavy enemy air attack. Returning to Leyte on 17 December, she continued on 20 December to Hollandia to prepare for anti-submarine and amphibious operations.

Carrying men of the 158th Regimental Combat Team, &quot;Kephart&quot; departed Noemfoor, Schouten Islands, on 4 January 1945 to rejoin the fight to liberate the Philippines. Steaming to Luzon, she arrived at San Fabien, Lingayen Gulf, on 11 January, and landed reinforcements, despite constant harassment from enemy planes emerging from the heavy air attack unscathed. Returning to Leyte on 15 January for three months of anti-submarine patrol, &quot;Kephart&quot; took part in scattered landing operations in the Philippines: at Grande Island, Subic Bay (30 January); Puerto Princesa, Palawan (28 February); Zamboanga, Mindanao (10 March); Cebu City, Cebu (26 March); and Cotabato, Mindanao (17 April).

&quot;Kephart&quot; departed Leyte Gulf on 4 May for escort and assault operations in the Dutch East Indies, arriving Morotai on 7 May. After escorting a convoy to Mindanao (18–20 May), she returned to Morotai on 21 May and embarked troops of the Australian Army for an amphibious assault at Brunei Bay, North Borneo. Sailing on 4 June, she landed troops on 10 June amid dwindling enemy resistance; then she patrolled the South China Sea, hunting submarines before returning Morotai on 19 June. She sailed on 26 June carrying Australian soldiers to the eastern coast of Borneo, arriving on 1 July for the final major amphibious operation of the war – the landing operations at Balikpapan, Borneo.

Continuing escort and anti-submarine duty, &quot;Kephart&quot; departed Morotai on 16 July and reached Leyte Gulf two days later. On 4 August she began amphibious training at Albay and Lagonoy Gulfs, Luzon, in preparation for a possible invasion of Japan. After the fighting ended on 15 August, she sailed from Leyte Gulf on 29 August to Okinawa to embark occupation troops for Korea. She reached Jinsen, Korea, on 8 September; and then shuttled between the Philippines and Korea. She steamed from Jinsen on 29 October via Sasebo, Japan, and Okinawa to Tsingtao, China, arriving there on 14 November to support the Chinese Nationalists&#x27; effort to repel Communist aggression on the Chinese mainland.

===Reserve Fleet===
Returning to Okinawa on 22 November, &quot;Kephart&quot; embarked 147 homebound veterans and departed on 26 November for the United States. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she reached San Diego, California on 16 December. Two days after unloading her passengers, she sailed for the East Coast, and arrived at New York on New Year&#x27;s Day 1946. Following overhaul, she departed on 8 February for Green Cove Springs, Florida, arriving there on 11 February. &quot;Kephart&quot; was decommissioned on 21 June, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1967 and transferred under the Military Assistance Program to the Republic of Korea on 16 May 1967.

&quot;Kephart&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

=== Transfer to South Korea ===
&quot;Kephart&quot; was renamed &quot;Kyong Puk&quot; (PF-82) by the Republic of Korea Navy. She was redesignated APD-85 in 1972, renumbered APD-826 in 1980, redesignated DE-826 in 1982. &quot;Kyong Puk&quot; was purchased outright by the Republic of Korea on 15 November 1974.

&quot;Kyong Puk&quot; was struck on 30 April 1985.

<doc id="1001096" wikidata="Q4950109" url="?curid=1001096" title="Bourbon Tabernacle Choir">
<text>The Bourbon Tabernacle Choir were a Canadian alternative rock band that formed in 1985 in Toronto.

==History==
The band consisted of vocalist Kate Fenner, vocalist and organist Chris Brown, vocalist and guitarist Andrew Whiteman, guitarist Chris Miller, saxophone and vocalist Chris Plock, bassist Jason Mercer, drummer Gregor Beresford, and guitarist and vocalist Peter Mercier when all of the founding members were high school classmates. Vocalist Dave Wall joined the band in 1988, and vocalist and saxophonist Gene Hardy joined in 1989.

They released three independent cassettes: &quot;First Taste of Bourbon&quot; in 1987, &quot;If Hell Had a Houseband&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Sister Anthony&quot; in 1990. The single &quot;Put Your Head On&quot; b/w &quot;As Right as They Want to Be&quot; (1990), produced by Bob Wiseman and recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario, attracted the attention of film director Bruce McDonald, who included it on the soundtrack to his 1991 film &quot;Highway 61&quot;. Both songs were later available on the CD reissue of &quot;Sister Anthony&quot; in 1995, although the original version of &quot;As Right as They Want to Be&quot; was replaced with a live version.

With the exposure they gained from &quot;Put Your Head On&quot;, the band signed to the independent label Yonder Records, and released &quot;Superior Cackling Hen&quot; in 1992. The singles &quot;Make Amends&quot;, &quot;Afterglow&quot; and &quot;Original Grin&quot; were all hits on campus and modern rock radio stations in the next year.

Following the release of &quot;Superior Cackling Hen&quot;, Whiteman left the band in 1993. After leaving the Bourbons, Whiteman recorded as a solo artist, and subsequently became a member of the bands Que Vida, Broken Social Scene and Apostle of Hustle. Beresford left the band in 1994, and performed drum tracks on Tom Cochrane&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Ragged Ass Road&quot;; Tom Bona replaced him in 1995.

Howie Beck and Daniel Barnes played with the band during this era.

In 1995, the band released &quot;Shy Folk&quot;, which featured contributions from Ani DiFranco and was produced by Michael Phillip Wojewoda, and which featured the singles &quot;All Peace&quot; and &quot;Be My Witness&quot;. Despite strong critical reviews, however, an expected mainstream breakthrough did not materialize, as the band&#x27;s manager pursued a strategy of keeping them off the road at first, in the hope of allowing market demand for their live show to build up so that he could book the band into larger venues than they had previously played. Instead of having the intended effect, the strategy merely reduced the album&#x27;s sales to barely half those of &quot;Superior Cackling Hen&quot;, and effectively derailed the band&#x27;s commercial momentum. In addition, when the band did finally tour they maintained a policy of refusing to play venues or music festivals, including Canadian Music Week, which involved sponsorship by tobacco companies, which further limited the number of venues available for them to play.

A CD reissue of &quot;Sister Anthony&quot; was also released in 1995.

Following &quot;Shy Folk&quot;, the band relocated to New York City to make its final bid for commercial success in the larger American market, but instead the band soon broke up.

==Post-breakup==

After the breakup, Brown and Fenner continued to record and perform as a duo. Jason Mercer played with DiFranco&#x27;s band and continues to tour with Ron Sexsmith as his bass player. He lives in Brooklyn, NY and works as a producer. Dave Wall recorded two albums (&quot;Lozenge&quot; and &quot;The Spell I Was Under&quot;) as a solo artist, performed in a duo with Marilyn Lerner and performed as a member of the Flying Bulgar Klezmer Band and Both Ends of the Earth. Chris Miller worked in film post-production. Hardy, Bona and Plock became session musicians who have played on albums by a wide variety of Canadian rock, pop, jazz and blues musicians, and Beresford joined David Wilcox&#x27;s band.

A retrospective album, &quot;Simply the Best 1985–1995&quot;, was released in 2000.

In 2008, the band played a reunion show at the Hillside Festival in Guelph on July 26, 2008 at the insistence of the festival&#x27;s director Sam Baijal. He felt it was important that they headline the festival&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The reunion lineup consisted of Brown, Fenner, Miller, Mercer, Wall, Hardy, Whiteman and Bona.

<doc id="1001103" wikidata="Q1340954" url="?curid=1001103" title="Sirkap">
<text>Sirkap (Urdu and ) is the name of an archaeological site on the bank opposite to the city of Taxila, Punjab, Pakistan.

The city of Sirkap was built by the Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius after he invaded modern-day Pakistan around 180 BC. Demetrius founded an Indo-Greek kingdom that was to last until around 10 BC. Sirkap is also said to have been rebuilt by king Menander I. 

==Archaeological excavations==

The excavation of the old city was carried out under the supervision of Sir John Marshall by Hergrew from 1912–1930. In 1944 and 1945 further parts were excavated by Mortimer Wheeler and his colleagues. Most of the discoveries at Sirkap related to the Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian periods (1st-2nd century CE). Overall excavations to the Greek levels have been very limited, and probably much remains hidden underground: in Sirkap, only about one eighth of the excavations were made down to the Indo-Greek and early Indo-Scythian levels, and this only in an area far removed from the center of the ancient city, where few discoveries could be expected.

==Greek city==
The site of Sirkap was built according to the &quot;Hippodamian&quot; grid-plan characteristic of Greek cities. It is organized around one main avenue and fifteen perpendicular streets, covering a surface of around , with a surrounding wall wide and long. The ruins are Greek in character, similar to those of Olynthus in Macedonia.

Numerous Hellenistic artifacts have been found, in particular coins of Greco-Bactrian kings and stone palettes representing Greek mythological scenes. Some of them are purely Hellenistic, others indicate an evolution of the Greco-Bactrian styles found at Ai-Khanoum towards more indianized styles. For example, accessories such as Indian ankle bracelets can be found on some representations of Greek mythological figures such as Artemis.

Following its construction by the Greeks, the city was further rebuilt during the incursions of the Indo-Scythians, and later by the Indo-Parthians after an earthquake in 30 AD. Gondophares, the first king of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, built parts of the city including the double headed eagle stupa and the temple of the sun god. The city was overtaken by the Kushan kings who abandoned it and built a new city at Sirsukh, about to the north-east.

==Religious buildings==
Buddhist stupas with strong Hellenistic decorative elements can be found throughout the Sirkap site (Stupa of the two eagles indicating a close interaction of religious cultures. A Greek religious temple of the Ionic order is also visible at the nearby site of Jandial ( from Sirkap), but there is a possibility that it may have been dedicated to a Zoroastrian cult. A temple of Buddhist goddess Hariti with hellenistic decoration was also found.

The site of Sirkap bears witness to the city-building activity of the Indo-Greeks during their occupation of the Indian territory for close to two centuries, as well as their integration of other faiths, especially Buddhism.

===Round stupa===
One round Stupa is present at Sirkap. It is one of the oldest Stupas in the Indian-Subcontinent. It is assumed that this Stupa was uprooted and thrown to its present location by a strong earthquake in the 1st century AD. When the new city was built later, the Stupa was kept by building a protecting wall around it.
===Apsidal Temple===
The building that is known as the Apsidal Temple is the largest sanctuary of Sirkap, measuring about (by contrast: the Parthenon in Athens is ). The Apsidal Temple consists of a square nave with several rooms, used by the Buddhist monks, and a circular room, which gives the building its apsidal shape. After the earthquake that destroyed the city in c. 30 AD, the Buddhist shrine was built in a spacious courtyard. The round part was probably in use for a small stupa, but no traces of it remain. Some carvings were probably done by an artist from Greece.
===Double-Headed Eagle Stupa===
A special Stupa at Sirkap is the so-called &#x27;Double-Headed Eagle Stupa&#x27;. The pilasters here are of a Greek design, &quot;Corinthian columns&quot;. In the middle arch, a Greek temple is shown; in the outer, a shrine of a Hindu design can be seen. On top of these sanctuaries, a Double-headed eagle is seated from which the name of the Stupa has been derived. This motif is rather odd, to say the least, as it is originally Babylonian. It seems to have spread to Scythia, and introduced in the Punjab by the Saka rulers.

===Dharmarajika Stupa===
The nearby Dharmarajika Stupa, is a large stupa that dates from the 2nd century CE. The stupa was built to house relics of the Buddha, while several monastic buildings were built around the stupa.

==Visit by Apollonius of Tyana==
The Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana is related to have visited ancient India, and specifically the city of Taxila in the 1st century AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type, probably referring to Sirkap:

:&quot;Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities&quot;.

:&quot;I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above.&quot;

<text>This is a selected bibliography and other resources for The Holocaust, including prominent primary sources, historical studies, notable survivor accounts and autobiographies, as well as other documentation and further hypotheses.

The Holocaust literature is extensive: The &quot;Bibliography on Holocaust Literature&quot; (edited by Abraham Edelheit and Hershel Edelheit) in its 1993 update listed around 20,000 items, including books, journal articles, pamphlets, newspaper stories and dissertations. Conversely, in a 1989 publication, Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) from 1987 to 2015, estimated that there were 200 books denying the Holocaust.

=== Early Reports ===
Some of the information relayed in the Grojanowski Report (from the extermination center at Chelmno), including an estimate of 700 thousand murdered Jews, was broadcast by the BBC on June 2, 1942. Mention of several details from this broadcast were recycled and reported on page 5 of the New York Times near the end of that month on June 27, 1942.

A New York Times article reports on the existence and use of the gas-chambers on November 24, 1942. It significantly understates the scale of the mass-killing ongoing in the camps, though it does quote the number killed that year at 250,000 and suggests by implication that operations were continuous or otherwise had not concluded. The article appears on page 10 of that day&#x27;s edition of the New York Times next to an ad for Seagram&#x27;s Gin much larger than the article itself. This brief mention broadcasts certain basic elements of the Racynski&#x27;s note, which was not officially circulated as a brochure under the heading &quot;The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland&quot; until several weeks later.

During the Second World War and in its immediate aftermath, many of the documents listed in the &quot;Primary Documents&quot; section above existed alongside a scattering of reports from individual camps such as Bettleheim&#x27;s &quot;Individual &amp; Mass-Behavior in Extreme Situations&quot;(1943) which appeared in the &quot;Journal of Abnormal Psychology.&quot; Early book-length works from survivors of the camps that became widely available immediately after the war include Kogon&#x27;s &quot;Theory and Practice of Hell&quot; (1st published in 1946 as &quot;Der SS-Staat: Das System de Deutschen Konzentrationslager&quot;), and Rousset&#x27;s &quot;Other Kingdom&quot; (1946).

The Bettleheim paper appearing in the &quot;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&quot; is a unique document, insofar as it was published while the concentration camps and extermination centers were still in operation and consisted of the testimony of a working psychiatric clinician in an attempt to report on the circumstances from the perspective of a survivor of the camps. However &quot;Individual &amp; Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations&quot;(1943) also represents the limitations of the early reports: Dachau and Buchenwald (where Bettleheim was imprisoned) were not, technically speaking, extermination centers (the gas-chambers were not used for mass-executions in those camps) and thus does not reflect the experience of prisoners in the death-camps in Eastern Europe but speaks to how the system operated within Germany.

Even reports that record massacres, camps and extermination centers in the East during the war such as Raczyński&#x27;s Note; the Black Book of Polish Jewry (which confines its sample to Poland, and understates, for a variety of reasons, the full scope of ongoing mass-murder); the Black Book of Soviet Jewry (which was compiled and presented for publication during the war but not circulated until after the war); and the Vrba–Wetzler report (which is contains the testimony of two prisoners escaped from Auschwitz-Birkenau, published alongside the testimony of the Jerzy Tabeau, the Polish Major in Auschwitz Protocols) speak only to limited areas within the system of extermination, do not present a full picture of the killing, and were scarcely made available to the larger public due to an editorial policy that questioned the statistics at the time. The Black Book of Soviet Jewry did not circulate during the war, while the Vrba–Wetzler report (April 1944) saw a limited and circumscribed distribution (though it convinced the regent of Hungary to halt transports in June 1944, which had until then been proceeding at a rate of 12,000 deportees per day). The Black Book of Polish Jewry and even earlier reports in the Allied press presented details, but these documents significantly understate the scale of the killings – due in part to limited information, and in part to a (retrospectively) misplaced sense of discretion and sensitivity to the prevailing attitude of antisemitism amongst all Western powers, whether Allied or Axis: there was a desire to make the reports speak to an audience unconcerned about the fate of Jews.

Articles such as the report on atrocities in the May 7th, 1945 issue of Life Magazine (7 May 1945, 31–37) began the process of substantively documenting and revealing aspects of what had happened to the global public whereas before knowledge of the mass-killings and the gas-chambers – though alluded to, for example, in speeches by Churchill (24 August 1941 broadcast, re: &#x27;Appeal to Roosevelt&#x27;) – and reported by rumor or anecdote, remained hazy and fragmentary in public consciousness. Many of the earliest accounts came from individual camps and the documents listed above – most substantially the Nuremberg Trial documentsbut these remained obscure apart from high-level (or generally vague) quotation in journalism.

<text>Valparaiso University (Valpo) is a private university in Valparaiso, Indiana, United States. It is an independent Lutheran university with five colleges. It enrolls nearly 2,300 students and has a campus.

The university is known for its Lutheran Christian heritage and has one of the largest chapels on a U.S. college campus. It accepts 94% of applicants for enrollment.

==History==

===Valparaiso Male and Female College===

In 1859, citizens of Valparaiso were so supportive of the placement of the college that they raised $11,000 to encourage the Methodist Church to locate there. The school opened on September 21, 1859, to 75 students, and was one of the first coeducational colleges in the nation. Students paid tuition expenses of $8 per term (three terms per year), plus nearby room and board costs of approximately $2 per week. Instruction at the college began with young children, and most of the students were in elementary and grade levels. Courses at the collegiate level included math, literature, history, sciences, and philosophy. Courses stressing the Christian faith included &quot;moral philosophy&quot; and &quot;moral science.&quot; During the Civil War, many students and administrators enrolled in the army. Financing problems led to the closing of the school in 1871.

===Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute===

The school, reopened by Henry Baker Brown in 1873, was named the Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute.

===Valparaiso College, then Valparaiso University===

In 1900, the school was renamed Valparaiso College and gained its current university status after being rechartered in 1906.

In 1902, Valpo became affiliated with the American College of Medicine and Surgery. The name was later changed to the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery in 1907. Students could save money by spending their first two medical college years in Valparaiso.

In 1905, Valpo formed an affiliation with Chicago College of Dental Surgery to provide dental education for its students. For the next two decades, Valpo gained a national reputation as an economic institution of higher learning, earning its positive nickname &quot;The Poor Man’s Harvard&quot;. At the height of enrollment in 1907, it was the second-largest school in the nation, behind only Harvard University. In 1914, the monthly literary magazine &quot;The Torch&quot; was founded; it became the university&#x27;s weekly student newspaper in 1915.

The university began intercollegiate athletic competition in 1916. Valpo&#x27;s first game was a basketball game against the Chicago YMCA Training School, in which VU fielded players from intramural teams.

In 1917, World War I and the death of President Brown took their toll, and the school was forced into bankruptcy. Valparaiso University sold the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery to Loyola University Chicago. In 1923, a fire destroyed the original 1860 Old College Building, and VU could not afford to clean the site. This was one of many financial problems Valparaiso faced in 1923, as President Horace M. Evans tried to settle a $375,000 debt. Evans appealed to the Rockefeller Foundation and other wealthy individuals before asking the Indiana state legislature to make VU public. The legislature refused, and Evans almost sold the university to the Ku Klux Klan, but the deal was stopped due to &quot;legal technicalities&quot;, likely cited to save face for both organizations.

Valparaiso University was eventually bought by the Lutheran University Association, a conglomerate of the National Lutheran Education Alliance and American Luther League.

===Lutheran revival===

In July 1925, the Lutheran University Association, affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, took over ownership of the school. The association was a group of clergy and church laity that saw promise in the school and wanted to create an academic institution not controlled by any church denomination. Valparaiso is still operated by the Lutheran University Association and remains an independent Lutheran institution that enjoys close relations with the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

On March 13, 1929, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the university. Two years later, President Kreinheder created the Valparaiso University Guild, a volunteer and philanthropy organization to help students, and in 1934 the Alumni Association began operation. The university&#x27;s College of Engineering started a cooperative education program with Purdue University in 1938. At the end of the 1930s, the university completed a new gymnasium. In 1941, VU instituted its Department of Art. Coincident with the beginning of World War II, Valparaiso University renamed its yearbook from &quot;The Uhlan&quot; (a German soldier) to &quot;The Beacon&quot;. The next year Valpo changed its athletic team name from the &quot;Uhlans&quot; to the &quot;Crusaders.&quot;

===Golden Era===

In 1940, O. P. Kretzmann became president of the university. During his 28 years in office, he marshaled significant changes, many of which remain in place. Valparaiso University bought about of land in 1944 east of campus near the corner of Sturdy Road and US Highway 30. The large oak tree occupying this land was named &quot;Merlin&quot; and remains a central feature of the campus. This purchase would transform the campus, as the university moved to its current location over many years.

Kretzmann increased enrollment from 400 to more than 4,000. Academic rigor increased along with enrollment. VU created its Honor Code in 1943 and remains in place today, as students continue to write the code on top of assignments. After the Second World War, Valparaiso offered its first four-year degrees: mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. On November 27, 1956, the Chapel Auditorium burned down. The university quickly rebuilt its worship space: the Chapel of the Resurrection was dedicated on September 27, 1959. VU installed a subcritical nuclear reactor in 1958, and in the 1970s the University Branch of the United States Atomic Energy Commission called Valpo&#x27;s nuclear physics lab &quot;a model for all small universities wishing to provide excellent training in the field of undergraduate physics.&quot;

President Kretzmann founded Christ College, the honors college of Valparaiso University, in 1967. Christ College was only the third such honors college in the nation. The campus radio station WVUR-FM began broadcasting in 1960. Robert F. Kennedy spoke before 5,000 people in 1968 at VU while campaigning, and in the same year, the university began its long-standing international study centers in Cambridge, England, and Reutlingen, Germany. During student protests in 1970, Kinsey Hall burned. The first class of the College of Nursing graduated in 1971. In 1976, Valparaiso University began NCAA Division I competition.

In 1991, Valpo became home to the Lilly Fellows Program, a national program that supports young scholar-teachers, during its inaugural year. This program has grown to almost 100 universities. The 1998 men&#x27;s basketball team reached the Sweet Sixteen of the Division I national tournament. In 2002, a new international study center was established in Hangzhou, China (since shuttered). Phi Beta Kappa established a chapter at Valparaiso University in 2004. In 2013 the university completed a solar furnace and research facility, the only undergraduate institution to operate a solar furnace, and one of only five solar furnaces in the US.

===Enrollment declines and financial challenges===
In 2008, Mark Heckler became Valparaiso University&#x27;s 18th president. During his initial years in office, Heckler embarked on the &quot;most comprehensive and collaborative strategic-planning endeavor in the University’s history&quot;. The plan included goals such as increasing enrollment to 6,000 students, multiple building initiatives, and increased global engagement; however student enrollment never increased as desired, and the university began to face serious financial strain as construction debt servicing and administrative staffing costs grew, while student enrollment faltered at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, poor rates of law students passing the bar exam led to a drop-off in enrollment and accreditation challenges.

After 2015, Valparaiso University began to struggle with enrollment and retention of students. The student population dropped from 4,544 in the fall of 2015 to 2,939 in the fall of 2022 and the law school was closed in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the university&#x27;s enrollment and budgetary problems reached an acute point, resulting in the discontinuances of multiple undergraduate programs (secondary education major, theatre major and minor, Chinese minor, French major, Greek and Roman studies major and minor). Due to financial stress, the university also laid off numerous lecturers and more than a dozen other tenure-track faculty in remaining programs and offered a retirement incentive buy-out package to long-term faculty and staff to incentivize voluntary departures. Meanwhile, the student retention rate also fell to 77%.

Amid these enrollment struggles, the university has also faced controversy. In 2021, the Indiana Attorney General&#x27;s office announced an investigation into the university&#x27;s Confucius Institute, alleging that it promotes Chinese propaganda. The university closed the institute and denied the allegations. In 2023, the board of directors decided to sell three paintings, including one by Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, from the Brauer Museum of Art to renovate freshman dorms. This raised strong opposition from the namesake of the museum and protest from some faculty and students about the erosion of the arts. The university eventually closed the museum and eliminated the corresponding staff positions, including its namesake director. The university announced in early 2024 that 28 additional programs would go into review for discontinuance due to budgetary problems, and embarked on the closure and demolition of additional buildings to reduce utilities costs. Later that year in July, VU confirmed the discontinuance of 30 programs.

==Campus==

===Old campus===

The Old Campus of Valparaiso University is adjacent to and a part of the historic downtown district of the city. Old Campus is the site of the School of Law, made up of Wesemann Hall and Heritage Hall. Heritage was the oldest remaining building on the campus and was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 2009, the school started a restoration project, essentially rebuilding the facility. The school&#x27;s fraternities and the Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center are on an old campus as was the Martin Luther King, Jr., Cultural Center before acts of vandalism and arson destroyed the building in 2009. Old Campus is also the site of Valpo&#x27;s Doppler weather radar. North of Old Campus is Lebien Hall, home to the College of Nursing and Health Professions.

===New campus===
Beginning in the 1950s, the school expanded eastward to occupy what is now known as the &quot;new campus&quot;. Today, it is the center of the university, home to thousands of students in nine dormitories as well as most of the academic buildings.

At the center of campus is the Chapel of the Resurrection, a -a high building that is the home of Valparaiso University&#x27;s many worship services and convocations. Built on the highest elevation on the university&#x27;s campus, it has been a Northwest Indiana landmark since 1959. In 2011, Rev. Mark and Kathy Helge gave a $15-million gift for a major expansion to the chapel. The addition opened in the fall of 2015.

The Christopher Center Library (built in 2004) houses over 500,000 books and numerous video and audio resources. It is a popular place for students to gather and study. The Valparaiso University Center for the Arts (VUCA) offers multiple performance facilities, which are most notably used by students to produce full-scale theatrical performances every year. The performances and exhibits in the Center for the Arts are always open to the public, and the Center houses the nationally renowned Brauer Museum of Art.

Kallay-Christopher Hall opened in 2004 and is home to the Department of Geography and Meteorology. Kallay-Christopher has an observation deck and large weather lab facilities. Adjoining Kallay-Christopher Hall is Schnabel Hall, which is home to communications students, WVUR-FM, the university&#x27;s student-run radio station, and VUTV, the university&#x27;s student-run television station.

The Donald V. Fites Innovations Center, an addition to the College of Engineering&#x27;s Gellersen Hall, was completed in the summer of 2011. The LEED-certified building has two suites of labs that support advanced undergraduate research in areas such as materials science and energy systems. The Department of Physics and Astronomy has a computerized reflecting telescope to aid in NASA research and VisBox-X2, a virtual reality system used to immerse students in a visualized three-dimensional image.

The Arts and Sciences Building, adjacent to the Christopher Center for Library and Information Resources, opened in 2012 and houses classrooms and offices for faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences.

The James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility was dedicated in September 2013. Professors and students use the energy research facility, profiled in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, in developing methods to produce low-carbon magnesium with 90 percent less fossil fuel energy than standard production methods.

The Harre Union opened in 2009. Named in honor of former University President Alan F. Harre, who retired in 2008, it is more than three times the size of the previous union. The Harre Union has consolidated all dining services on campus, except the law school. It has room for all student organizations, as well as a new bookstore, lounge areas, student mailboxes for every student on campus, entertainment areas, a large ballroom, a career center, and an outdoor terrace overlooking the chapel. The design architect was Sasaki Associates, Inc. and the architect of record was Design Organization.

In June 2013, the Duesenberg Welcome Center on campus was completed for visitors coming to campus. The creation of this building was funded by Valparaiso University alumni, Richard and Phyllis Duesenberg.

A new residence hall, Beacon Hall, opened in 2014.

A &quot;STEM village&quot; of three new buildings will soon replace Neils Science Center and become the new home for the biology, chemistry, and physics departments. The first of these buildings was completed in 2017. Neils Science Center was erected in 1974 and includes a planetarium, greenhouse, and a now decommissioned sub-critical nuclear reactor that helped the facility received an Atomic Energy Commission citation as a model undergraduate physics laboratory. The new Center for the Sciences: Chemistry and Biochemistry opened in fall 2017.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate programs===
Valparaiso is organized into five undergraduate colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, Engineering, Nursing and Health Professions, and Christ College.

====College of Arts and Sciences====
The College of Arts and Sciences integrates liberal arts and professional development. It provides hands-on, undergraduate research opportunities and internships to accompany the classroom experience. With more than 70 academic programs in 21 departments, the College of Arts and Sciences supplies the liberal arts core for all programs.

====College of Business====
The College of Business is among the elite 25 percent of undergraduate business programs nationally accredited by the AACSB International — The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The College of Business offers focused majors in accounting, business analytics, finance, international business, management, and marketing. Starting in 2018 Fall, the college of business is offering a new major and minor in supply chain and logistics management.

====College of Engineering====
The 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; named the College of Engineering the 13th-best undergraduate engineering program among institutions that do not have doctorate programs. The College of Engineering won the 2012 Engineering Award presented by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering. About 90 percent of undergraduates complete the program within four years. The college provides several service learning opportunities as well as undergraduate research opportunities.

====Christ College====
Christ College is the interdisciplinary Honors College of Valparaiso University. Known on campus as &quot;CC&quot;, Christ College was chartered by President O. P. Kretzmann in 1967. In 1964, Kretzmann convened a committee to plan a successor to the Directed Studies Program, which was established to better serve the influx of gifted students to the institution. This new college within VU would seek students who had &quot;a passion for learning and the pursuit of excellence generally.&quot;

The Christ College curriculum was to be based, in part, on the University of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Liberal Arts&quot; core model. Incoming freshmen would read classical texts and use the Socratic Method to discover &quot;that they did not know what they thought they knew.&quot; In later years, courses that transcend assignment to a particular academic discipline challenged students to explore important questions from an imaginative perspective. This structure remains intact as every freshman enrolls in the Freshman Program, which consists of a 16-credit, two-semester course that introduces students to classic works of history, literature, art, music, philosophy, religion and theology, and social science.

In addition to classes, several traditions create camaraderie and foster the intellectual formation of students. The most notable of these annual events are the fall Christ College Freshman Production and the spring Christ College Oxford Debates. The Freshman Production is an original play or musical that is written, scored, choreographed, directed, produced, and performed exclusively by members of the Christ College freshman class. The Christ College Oxford Debates are a series of formal debates in which two groups of students represent either the affirmative or negative side of a topic they have researched for five or six weeks. Following the debate, the debate moderator asks the audience members to &quot;vote their minds&quot; and decide the winner of the debate. Another notable academic opportunity offered by Christ College is the Student Scholarship Symposium, in which undergraduates present research in a formal lecture setting. It features student-selected research projects, from a diverse set of academic fields, delivered in a critical and interactive environment. Students in the college often spend a semester studying at one of Valpo&#x27;s overseas study centers; many take a Christ College Abroad course, which is led by faculty each spring break.

Approximately 90 students, or 10 percent of the university&#x27;s incoming class, are admitted each year. Students in the honors college concurrently enroll in another undergraduate college at VU and can complete their study with a major or a minor in humanities to complement the major received in their main field of study.

===Graduate studies===
Valparaiso University offers a variety of master&#x27;s, doctoral, and graduate certificate programs.

===Law school===

Founded in 1879, the Law School was accredited by the American Bar Association in 1929 and the Association of American of Law Schools in 1930. In 2010, Valparaiso law students had an 83 percent first-time bar pass rate. After a censure by the ABA in October 2016, the university sought to downsize the law school or merge it with another institution. In November 2017, the university announced the law school would not enroll a new class in 2018, and in October 2018 the university announced it would close the law school and was developing a plan to allow the remaining students to complete their degrees.

===Study abroad===
More than a third of all undergraduate students study abroad, placing Valparaiso University among the top 40 institutions in the country. VU offers more than 40 study-abroad programs around the world, and the duration of study-abroad programs ranges from a week to a full academic year. In 2013, the U.S. Department of State named VU as one of the colleges and universities that produced the most Fulbright scholars. Between 2003 and 2013, 26 Valparaiso students studied abroad as a Fulbright scholar.

Valpo maintains four global study centers (Cambridge, England; Reutlingen, Germany; Hangzhou, China; and San José, Costa Rica), each of which provides group trips and excursions, a course on the life and culture of the host country, and specialized housing, all under the guidance of an on-site resident director. Valpo partners with International Education Programs, or IEP. Other sites students can study in include Athens, Greece; Granada, Spain; Zaragoza, Spain; Cergy-Pointoise, France; La Rochelle, France; Paris, France; Limerick, Ireland; Newcastle, Australia; Rottenburg am Neckar, Germany; Tübingen, Germany; Chiang Mai, Thailand; Delhi, India; Coimbatore, India; Osaka, Japan; Viña Del Mar, Chile; Puebla, Mexico; and Windhoek, Namibia.

===Distance learning===
The university offers online degree programs such as the Post-MSN Doctorate in Nursing Practice. The accelerated degree programs are Web-based.

==Reputation and rankings==
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; university rankings, Valpo was ranked tied for 204th among national universities. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rated Valpo 45th in &quot;Best Value Schools&quot;, tied for 262nd in Top Performers on Social Mobility, and tied for 15th in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs.

&quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, which publishes its College Guide annually, ranked Valpo #149 for social mobility, #182 for research, and #291 for service among national universities in 2021.

==Student body==

===Students===
Valparaiso University Students are from geographically diverse backgrounds. Of the nearly 3,000 students, only one-third are from the school&#x27;s home state of Indiana. The remainder comes from almost every other state of the United States and nearly 50 countries. Over half graduate in the top quarter of their high school class, and 77 percent return to Valpo after their freshman year. Annually, more than $26 million is awarded by the university to more than 80 percent of the student body, which is administered based on factors such as community involvement, interests, recommendations, and personality, as well as grade point average, class ranking, and standardized test scores.

Sixty-one percent of Valparaiso University students live on the school&#x27;s city campus and all students who do not have senior status are required to live in residence halls. Eleven percent of students are Lutheran, and 75 percent participate in faith-related activities. Valpo supports more than 100 student-administered organizations, clubs, and activities. Fifty percent participate in intramural athletics, and more than 1,000 students give more than 45,000 hours of community service to the region each year.

===Greek life===
More than 25 percent of Valpo students are members of one of the school&#x27;s ten national fraternities or six national sororities. The 2013-2014 Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life Annual Report documented more than 10,000 hours of community service and $45,000 of financial report to local and national non-profits. All but one organization had a cumulative GPA above 3.0 during the spring semester, and the average GPA across all of Greek Life was 3.247.

===Honor societies===
Valparaiso hosts chapters of all major honors fraternities, including Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society.

===Student activism===
Valparaiso University has a history of student activism. Prominent examples with long-lasting effects include:

==== Kinsey Hall fire ====
While many colleges amended or canceled the remainder of the 1969–1970 school year after the Kent State shootings due to unrest, the Valparaiso administration ignored student calls for seminars and forums about violence at other campuses. A large group of students then organized a protest march from the campus Victory Bell to the Porter County courthouse. Continued protests led to discussions between the administration and student leaders. When these talks failed, still-unidentified students set fire to the empty Kinsey Hall administrative building in the early morning. The fire destroyed the building.

==== Student-led restoration of the engineering college ====
The existence of Valparaiso University&#x27;s College of Engineering is the result of student activism. The university&#x27;s engineering program had been reduced to a two-year associate degree in response to reduced enrollment during an economic depression, which dominated the 1930s. When students began inquiring in 1948 regarding the possibility of restoring a four-year degree program, university president O.P. Kretzmann cited a lack of space and lack of resources to build a new facility. Students responded with an offer to build the new facility if he would guarantee faculty positions, to which the president agreed. The students constructed the facility themselves using their engineering education and an intense fundraising campaign, and by 1951 the new College of Engineering was again granting four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees. This story received national attention and was the subject of the feature-length film &quot;Venture of Faith&quot;. In 1968, the College of Engineering was rehoused in the newly built Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center. Following the fire at Kinsey Hall, the old engineering building became the home to the Art department. On April 29, 2022, the building, which had been renamed to the Art-Psychology building, had a fire that resulted in the complete loss of the building. 

=== Student media ===
Valparaiso University&#x27;s student media organizations (WVUR: The Source, VUTV, The Beacon, The Torch, and The Lighter) are all award-winning and long-standing. Many student participants have won awards for their work in student-run media organizations.

==Athletics==
Valpo&#x27;s colors are brown and gold and athletic teams are known as the Beacons. Most athletic events are held in the Athletics-Recreation Center (ARC), which is the primary sporting facility on campus. Valparaiso&#x27;s eighteen teams and nearly 600 student-athletes mostly participate in NCAA Division I (I-FCS for football) in the Missouri Valley Conference. Valparaiso competes in four sports that the MVC does not sponsor. The football team plays in the Pioneer Football League at Brown Field. Men&#x27;s swimming and men&#x27;s tennis compete in the Summit League, and bowling (a women-only sport at the NCAA level) competes in Conference USA.

In 1942, Valparaiso University fielded the tallest basketball team in the world, and the so-called &quot;Valparaiso Giants&quot; or &quot;The World&#x27;s Tallest Team&quot; played at Madison Square Garden in the 1944–1945 season. The VU football team played in the Cigar Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day 1951. Valpo is also known for its men&#x27;s basketball head coach Homer Drew and his son Bryce Drew, who led the team to its Sweet Sixteen appearance in the 1998 NCAA basketball tournament by making &quot;The Shot&quot;, a three-point shot as time expired, to beat favored Ole Miss by one point. Bryce Drew was named head coach in the spring of 2011. Valparaiso is also the home of the National Lutheran Basketball Tournament.

The men&#x27;s soccer team won the Horizon League regular season conference championship in 2011. Men&#x27;s basketball followed with a 2011 Horizon League crown of its own while the baseball and softball teams both won regular season and Horizon League Tournament titles, representing the conference in the NCAA Tournament. In addition, the bowling team earned a berth at the NCAA Championships in just its third season of existence. In addition, Head Coach Carin Avery led the women&#x27;s volleyball team to great success recently. In their 2014–2015 season, they pursued their 13th consecutive 20-win season. They were one of 10 programs nationwide to have won at least 20 matches in each of the previous 12 years, during which time Avery led the team to three conference regular season and tournament championships, as well as advancing to the NCAA Tournament on three occasions. In the spring of 2013 the men&#x27;s golf team won the Horizon League Championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament.

NCAA Division I teams include baseball (men), basketball, bowling (women), cross country, football (men), golf, soccer, softball (women), swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. The university has cheerleading and spirit squads, as well as several intramural and club sports: flag football, innertube water polo, miniature golf, sand volleyball, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, ultimate frisbee, and volleyball.

On February 11, 2021, Valparaiso announced it would retire the &quot;Crusaders&quot; nickname because of the &quot;negative connotation and violence associated with the Crusader imagery&quot;. On August 10, 2021 &quot;Beacons&quot; was announced as the new nickname.

<doc id="1001109" wikidata="Q11862397" url="?curid=1001109" title="Herman Badillo">
<text>Herman Badillo ( , ; August 21, 1929 – December 3, 2014) was an American lawyer and politician who served as borough president of The Bronx and United States Representative, and ran for Mayor of New York City. He was the first Puerto Rican elected to these posts, and the first Puerto Rican mayoral candidate in a major city in the continental United States.

==Early years and personal life==
Badillo was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico. When he was 11 years old, both of his parents died of tuberculosis and he was sent to live with his aunt in New York City. After graduating from the public school system at Haaren High School, Badillo attended the City College of New York earning a Bachelor in Business Administration in 1951. In 1954 he received an LL.B. from Brooklyn Law School, graduating first in his class. The next year he was admitted to the New York State Bar. In 1956, he also became a certified public accountant.

==Early political career==
After joining the Caribe Democratic Club in 1958, Badillo held various offices within the City and State, including Bronx Borough President in 1966. Prior to that he served as New York Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.

Embarking on his role as Bronx Borough President in January 1966, Badillo was met with the ongoing advocacy for the preservation of Bronx Borough Hall as a landmark, led by prior Bronx Borough President Joseph F. Periconi. Periconi had, along with several historians, successfully attained landmark status for the building in October 1965, bestowed by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. It was then placed under final review by the Board of Estimate of New York City. On January 27, 1966, the last day of the 90-day review period, the board voted to revoke the landmark status, deferring to the new incumbent&#x27;s view on the matter. In 1968 a mysterious fire burned part of the interior. Though still repairable, it was demolished in 1969.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1970 Badillo was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 21st District in the South Bronx, becoming the first Puerto Rican to so serve. He was re-elected for three subsequent consecutive terms. He was also a member of the Committee on Education and Labor.

In 1976 he was challenged by South Bronx Councilman Ramon Velez in a contest for the Democratic Party nomination for Congressman of the 21st District. Badillo was reelected easily with 75 percent of the vote. In December of that year, he was one of the five Latino members of Congress who established the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Largely by his efforts, job training for unemployed non-English speaking citizens was included in the &quot;Comprehensive Manpower Act of 1973&quot;.

Badillo also served on the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee, where he had a seat on the Minority Enterprise and General Oversight Sub-committee. During his time in office he supported legislation intended to counteract various types of discrimination in employment, including discrimination base on age and marital status.

Although he would later become a vociferous opponent of bilingual education, as a congressman Badillo was one of the first champions of funding for bilingual education programs. Some proponents of bilingual and ESL education, and opponents of English immersion, attacked Badillo for his newfound opposition to Spanish-language teaching. He was also a critical player in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and the inclusion of its language access provisions. During his tenure in Congress, he became an important national spokesperson for Federal investment in urban centers.

==Mayoral campaigns==
Badillo sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York in 1969, 1973, 1977, 1981 and 1985. In the 1973 Democratic primary he came in second with 29% of the vote behind Abe Beame (34%) and ahead of Mario Biaggi (21%) and Albert H. Blumenthal (16%). His closest contest came in his second attempt when he was defeated by then-New York City Comptroller Abe Beame in a runoff primary, in 1973. This was the first election with a primary run off.

In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, dropping out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. Badillo unsuccessfully sought a Republican mayoral nomination in 2001, losing in a landslide vote for billionaire businessman and political neophyte Michael Bloomberg who would later prevail in that general election.

==Deputy Mayor of New York City==
Badillo resigned from Congress on December 31, 1977, to become deputy mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch, a position he held until September 1979. Badillo was one of seven deputy mayors appointed by Koch for the first portion of his administration. He served alongside Basil Paterson. As a deputy mayor Badillo handled labor relations and community outreach for Koch. In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over the lack of support for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch.

==Post-City Hall career and State Comptroller campaign==
After leaving City Hall, Badillo worked as an attorney in New York City. He supported Mario Cuomo for governor over Koch during the 1982 Democratic primary. In late 1983 Cuomo appointed Badillo Chairman of the State of New York Mortgage Agency. In 1985 Badillo considered a bid for mayor against Koch in the Democratic primary. The 1985 mayoral election had consequential politics for New York City. In 1986 Badillo was the Democratic nominee for New York State Comptroller, losing to Republican incumbent Edward Regan. During these years Badillo was also active in Presidential politics, supporting Alan Cranston for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988.

==City Comptroller campaign==
In 1993, Badillo, though still a Democrat, campaigned for Comptroller of New York City on a &quot;fusion&quot; basis with Republican Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s mayoral campaign. He also sought the Democratic nomination, but finished third, behind Alan Hevesi and the incumbent Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman. Although Giuliani won the general election, Badillo, running on the Republican and Liberal party lines, was defeated by Hevesi.

In 1993 Eric Adams, while President of the Grand Council of Guardians, accused Badillo of betraying his Hispanic heritage by having as his wife a white, Jewish woman (Irma, to whom Badillo had been married for 32 years, and who had Alzheimer&#x27;s), instead of a Latina. Badillo responded that &quot;Voting based on race is the definition of racism, and has no place in a civilized multiracial society...&quot; Badillo added: &quot;I don&#x27;t apologize to anyone for the fact that my wife is Jewish.&quot;

==Giuliani administration and CUNY chairmanship==
Badillo held a series of positions with the Giuliani administration, serving as the mayor&#x27;s Special Counsel on education policy and as chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York. In his capacity as Giuliani&#x27;s education advisor, Badillo advocated increased mayoral control of the public schools and a revamped curriculum; he was also Giuliani&#x27;s liaison to the city&#x27;s board of education.

These actions gained him some support among conservatives but alienated him from the mainstream of the Puerto Rican political leadership, which had been his traditional base.

In 1999, Badillo&#x27;s remarks about Latino immigrants ignited calls for his dismissal. His reference to recent Dominican Republic and Mexico immigrants as &quot;pure Indians -- Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five feet tall with straight hair,&quot; and never having a &quot;tradition of education&quot; were widely criticized, and he apologized two days later.

==Republican Party switch and 2001 mayoral campaign==
In the late 1990s Badillo formally joined the Republican Party. He resigned as education special counsel and CUNY Chairman when announcing his candidacy for mayor in 2001. Despite his strong support of Mayor Giuliani, Badillo&#x27;s bid for mayor never received serious support from Giuliani or the Republican Party, and he lost badly in the Republican primary to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who had just switched parties as Badillo had done earlier.

==Later career==
In 2005, Badillo became &quot;of counsel&quot; to the New York City law firm of Sullivan Papain Block McGrath &amp; Cannavo P.C. In 2006 he joined the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research as a senior fellow. In January 2011 Badillo joined national personal injury law firm Parker Waichman Alonso as a senior counsel in its New York office. Badillo died on December 3, 2014, at the Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, of congestive heart failure at the age of 85.

*:This book generated major controversy within the Latino community before it was even published because of an inflammatory article in the &quot;New York Post&quot; (December 19, 2006, p. 8) announcing its release. In the book Badillo criticizes what he perceives as a lax work ethic among Hispanics, who he contends do not value education as much as other immigrants just as historically impoverished but more successful, such as Asian-Americans.
*:In contrast to the support he gave to bilingual education during his early career, his book attacks what he describes as obstacles to assimilation, such as bilingual education, and urges Hispanics to eschew government solutions and adopt instead the cultural values that have made previous generations of American immigrants prosperous and successful. His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% of the population of the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.

<text>Charpai (also, Charpaya, Charpoy, Khat, Khatla, Manja, or Manji) is a traditional woven bed used across South Asia. The name charpai is a compound of &quot;char&quot; &quot;four&quot; and &quot;pay&quot; &quot;footed&quot;. Regional variations are found in Afghanistan and Pakistan, North and Central India, Bihar and Myanmar.

The charpai is a simple design that is easy to construct. It was traditionally made out of a wooden frame and natural-fiber ropes, but modern charpais may have metal frames and plastic tapes. The frame is four strong vertical posts connected by four horizontal members; the design makes the construction self-leveling. Lacing or rope can be made out of cotton, date leaves, and other natural fibers. The open and airy design of the charpai provides ventilation, making it an suitable choice for warm climates. Accordingly, it is mostly used in warm areas: in cold areas, a similar rope bed would be topped (with an insulating palliasse or tick, stuffed with straw, chaff, or down feathers), and possibly hung with curtains.

There are many interpretations of the traditional design, and over the years craftspeople have innovated with the weave patterns and materials used. The weaving is done in many ways, e.g. a diagonal cross (bias) weave, with one end woven short, and laced to the endpiece, for tensioning adjustments (which helps in controlling the sagging of the bed as it ages with use).

In the 1300s, Ibn Battuta described the charpai as having &quot;four conical legs with four crosspieces of wood on which braids of silk or cotton are woven. When one lies down on it, there is no need for anything to make it pliable, for it is pliable of itself.&quot;

Recognized for its portability, adapted charpais were used as colonial campaign furniture.

== Construction ==

* Paaga: the legs of the charpai can be simple or mimic the legs of an animal
* Iss: the long beams of the frame, which is proportionately twice the length of the Upala
* Upala: the short beams of the frame which is kept higher than Iss
* Munj: is the webbing of rope that creates the main surface that the person sleeps on
* Badaan: is the extended area of the rope near the foot which keeps the tension

== History ==
Its exact provenance of the charpai is unknown. Various versions of it can be found in Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures; however, the simple structured, handmade charpai is indigenous to the Indian Subcontinent. The oldest description of a charpoi in India dates back to the 2nd century BC. Bedsteads are depcited in scenes of the life of Budha. This kind of furniture in the Buddhist time period is referred to as “Manca.” There are four known types of Mancas from ancient times: Masaranka (a longer version), Bundikabaddh (aversion with slots), Kulirapadaka (a version with curved legs) and Achacca Padaka (a version with removable legs).

<text>The Flying Bulgars (formerly the Flying Bulgar Klezmer Band) was a Toronto-based Canadian band, which played music rooted in the Jewish music of Eastern Europe. The band&#x27;s style incorporated elements of rock, jazz and salsa. &#x27;Bulgar&#x27; in the group&#x27;s name refers to a dance form, not an ethnic group.

The band&#x27;s final line-up consisted of David Buchbinder (trumpet), Dave Wall (of the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir) (guitar), Max Senitt (drums), Peter Lutek (woodwinds), Tania Gill (piano) and Victor Bateman (bass).

The Bulgars recorded five CDs and received three Juno nominations. They are the only Klezmer band to have created a music video which received airplay on MuchMusic.

==Background==

After the founding of Israel in 1948, the Yiddish language and the art associated with it were marginalized by many Jews, for whom Yiddish represented the ghettos of Eastern Europe and the holocaust. In the fifties and sixties it was chic to sing songs in Hebrew, the language of the new Jewish state. In 1975, a group of young San Francisco musicians, The Klezmorim, released an album called &quot;East Side Wedding&quot;, and the Klezmer renaissance was on. Across North America and Europe dozens of new groups sprang up, reclaiming the tradition of Eastern European Jewish music. Klezmer music brought together the traditions of the Tsarist Russian military band, Gypsy music, Nigun (Hasidic religious song), and Afro-American jazz. The Jewish New Wave, as it came to be called, brought funk, r&amp;b, new music and free jazz into the mix.

The Flying Bulgars was a product of the rebirth of interest in Yiddish culture in North America. While they performed material from the early days of Klezmer, the majority of their repertoire was new music written by band members. The development of a personal sound, along with a highly charged performance style, opened extensive performing opportunities.

==Biography==

Formed by Buchbinder in 1988, and co-led by Dave Wall, The Flying Bulgar Klezmer Band was a product of the rebirth of interest in Yiddish culture in North America. In 1988 they played its first concert at Toronto&#x27;s famed Clinton&#x27;s Tavern. That was followed by a 1989 show as part of the Mariposa Folk Festival (to which it would return in 1992).

In 1990, the band released its first (self-named) album. and performed at the Folk on the Rocks Festival in Yellowknife (it would return the following year). The album was nominated for Best World Beat Recording at the Juno Awards of 1992.

By 1993, the band name had been changed to The Flying Bulgars, and the band released its second album, &quot;Agada&quot;. The album was very well received and was nominated for Best Global Recording at the Juno Awards of 1994. The band toured in support of the album, appearing at the Vancouver Folk Festival and Mayfest Glasgow in 1994.

In 1996, The Flying Bulgars released their third album &quot;Fire&quot;, with the Yiddish singer Adrienne Cooper. That year, with the popularity of the genre growing, the band played at Klezmer Mania! in Berkeley, CA, and played shows in various North American cities.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Tsirkus&quot;, was released in 1999. Further, in 2000, they performed at New York&#x27;s Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival. In March 2001, the Flying Bulgars were part of Toronto&#x27;s Feast of the East festival; their performance was aired on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Play&quot; with Jian Ghomeshi.

In May 2002, the Flying Bulgars performed their show &quot;Shekhine-Spirit in the Natural World&quot; before a sold-out crowd at Toronto&#x27;s Isabel Bader Theatre. The concert (which featured guest artists Jane Bunnett, Levon Ichkhanian, Rick Shadrach Lazar, Stephen Donald and Alex Poch-Goldin) was the group&#x27;s first theatrical presentation, melding music, poetry and visual elements (stage design and video).

A recording of this work, produced by David Travers-Smith and featuring new compositions by every band member, was released in June 2003 as &quot;Sweet Return&quot;. &quot;Sweet Return&quot; received rave reviews and was nominated as World Music Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2004.

In 2004, the band started off with an appearance as a headliner at the Chutzpah! Festival in Vancouver. It played at Ottawa&#x27;s Tulip Festival, the Nova Scotia Multicultural Festival, Festival d&#x27;été de Québec and, back in British Columbia, the Mission Folk Festival.

The Flying Bulgars have toured throughout Canada, and performed internationally, including at the WOMAD festival in Morcombe, England, and the Tollwood Festival in Munich. They also participated annually in the Ashkenaz Festival in Toronto, a festival of Jewish culture which was founded by David Buchbinder and is one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious festivals of its kind.

The Bulgars sixth studio album, &quot;Tumbling Into Light&quot;, was released on November 10, 2009. The recording was produced by David Newfeld and engineered by Jeremy Darby at Toronto&#x27;s Canterbury Music Company. On January 31, 2010, the band staged a multi-media, multi-disciplinary performance of &quot;Tumbling Into Light&quot; featuring Andrea Mann (dance), Bruce McDonald (film) and Lorenzo Savoini (design) at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. It was directed by McDonald, and co-produced by the band, McDonald and BravoFACT.

The Flying Bulgars disbanded in 2010 but, on February 3, 2018, they played a show to mark the 30th anniversary of their first performance at Clinton&#x27;s Tavern.

<text>Elon University is a private university in Elon, North Carolina, United States. Founded in 1889 as Elon College, the university is organized into six schools, most of which offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees and several of which offer master&#x27;s degrees or professional doctorate degrees. Located in North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont region, Elon is situated on a suburban campus between the cities of Greensboro and Raleigh. Elon&#x27;s athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Coastal Athletic Association.

==History==
Elon College was founded by the Christian Connection, which later became a part of the United Church of Christ. The charter for Elon College was issued by the North Carolina legislature in 1889. William S. Long was the first president, and the original student body consisted of 76 students. In 1923, a fire destroyed most of the campus, including school records, classrooms, the library, and the chapel. The board of trustees voted to rebuild immediately. Many of the buildings that were erected in the years following the fire still stand and make up the bedrock of Elon&#x27;s campus.

An institution that for many years enrolled mostly North Carolina residents, Elon began to enroll significant numbers of students from the mid-Atlantic states in the mid-1970s, and began to improve its academic standards for admission. By the year 2000, about 68 percent of Elon&#x27;s students came from out-of-state and were only accepted if they met high academic standards. Elon became known as a selective university and, by 2013, 82% of incoming students were from out of state. &quot;Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College&#x27;s Strategic Climb to National Distinction&quot; (2004), an academic study by George Keller of the University of Pennsylvania, chronicles how the school changed from a regional religious college to a selective, nationally recognized university.

Elon is no longer affiliated with the United Church of Christ. Elon University&#x27;s mission statement states that the school &quot;embraces its founders&#x27; vision of an academic community that transforms mind, body, and spirit and encourages freedom of thought and liberty of conscience&quot; and emphasizes its commitment to &quot;nurture a rich intellectual community characterized by student engagement with a faculty dedicated to excellent teaching and scholarly accomplishment.&quot;

On October 9, 2017, the Elon Board of Trustees elected Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Ledoux Book as the ninth president of the university. Book became Elon&#x27;s first female President on March 1, 2018.

==Academics==

==Athletics==

Elon&#x27;s 17 varsity sports teams, known as the Phoenix, joined the NCAA&#x27;s Division I Colonial Athletic Association on July 1, 2014, after a decade in the Southern Conference. Intercollegiate sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, soccer, and tennis for men, and basketball, cross-country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, softball, tennis, lacrosse, and volleyball for women. The football team competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA).

Campus Recreation offers intramural and club sports programs, such as baseball, cycling, lacrosse, flag football, equestrian, swimming, rugby union, triathlon, water skiing, ice hockey and Ultimate Frisbee. During Winter Term the intramurals include bowling, arena football, dodgeball, ultimate frisbee, and a monster golf tournament.

Up until 2000, the mascot of Elon was the Fighting Christian. Early Elon athletic teams were known as the &quot;Christians&quot; with the name &quot;Fighting Christians&quot; gaining popularity by 1923. The nickname was chosen due to Elon&#x27;s proximity to the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, Guilford Quakers, and the Duke Blue Devils. As Elon committed itself to diversity, and the number of non-Christian students increased, the decision was made to change Elon&#x27;s mascot. In 2000, a new mascot was adopted, the Phoenix. The choice came from the 1923 fire that destroyed almost the entire campus and the college&#x27;s subsequent recovery.

===Facilities===
Elon&#x27;s sports facilities include two gymnasiums, Schar Center, Walter C. Latham Baseball Park, Rhodes Stadium, Rudd Field, Hunt Softball Park, Alumni Field House, Koury Field House, Jerry and Jeanne Robertson Track and Field Complex (named in honor of humorist and speaker Jeanne Robertson who had been an Elon trustee, and her husband, &quot;Left Brain&quot;), six club athletic fields, Worseley Golf Center, and Koury Center, which features the 2,400 seat Alumni Gym, an aerobic fitness center, a weight room, racquetball courts, an indoor pool, and a dance studio.

The Jimmy Powell Tennis Center, a twelve-court complex, won an &quot;Outstanding Facility Award&quot; from the United States Tennis Association.

The facility at the north end of Rhodes Stadium in the North Athletics Complex is the headquarters for Phoenix athletics. Construction was completed on the 5,100-seat Schar Center in 2018. The Schar Center is the home to Elon&#x27;s basketball and volleyball programs.

==Campus==
Elon&#x27;s historic campus is located in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, adjacent to Burlington, a city of 50,000. Elon&#x27;s campus is divided into seven major neighborhoods: Historic Campus, Central Campus, Global Neighborhood, The Oaks, The Station at Mill Point, Danieley Center, East Neighborhood, The Colonnades, and South Campus. The Elon College Historic District and Johnston Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Campus life ==
The university has more than 250 campus organizations and programs, including 12 national fraternities and 13 national sororities.

===Student media===
Some of the student media on campus includes &quot;The Pendulum&quot;, Elon&#x27;s undergraduate weekly newspaper published Wednesdays, and WSOE, the university&#x27;s student-run non-commercial campus radio station, airing since 1977. ESTV (Elon Student Television) is the Student television station featuring numerous student-created and -run programs. One of Elon Student Televisions&#x27; shows run in large-part by Joey Gizzi and Steven Lannum, &quot;Elon After Hours,&quot; would later become AreYouKiddingTV: an internet challenge and entertainment social media account mainly popular on Tik Tok and YouTube.

In 2016, with advice of their faculty advisers, the two largest student media organizations on campus; Elon Local News (ELN) and &quot;The Pendulum&quot; newspaper, merged to form the new Elon News Network (ENN). ENN now operates out of the newly constructed newsroom in the McEwen Building of the School of Communications. Following a 2016 expansion of facilities, The School of Communications consists of Iris Holt McEwen Hall, the Snow Family Grand Atrium, Turner Theatre, Dwight C. Schar Hall, Steers Pavilion, and Long Hall, which houses the MA in Interactive Media graduate program and the sport management major.

===Extra-curricular organizations===
Numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations are represented on campus, including Elon Volunteers, Habitat for Humanity, Model UN, Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Alpha Phi Omega, the Inter-Residence Council, the Elon University Student Government Association, and the Student Union Board. Cultural groups on campus include the Asian-Pacific Islander Student Association, Black Student Union, the Caribbean Student Association, , Intercultural Club, and Spectrum (Gay-Straight Alliance).

Elon is home to the Fire of the Carolinas Marching Band (FOTC). The band also includes color guard (flag spinning) and dance auxiliary squads.

===Religious life===
Religious groups on campus include Catholic Campus Ministry, , InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, the Iron Tree Blooming Meditation Society, the Muslim Student Association, Baptist Student Union, and Campus Outreach.

The Jewish population at Elon has grown especially rapidly in recent years, with twelve percent of recent classes self-identifying as Jewish. Elon was profiled in &quot;Reform Judaism&quot; magazine in 2011 as a school which has &quot;gone the extra mile&quot; to make itself more attractive to Jewish students, and since 2013 it has been listed as one of the &quot;top schools Jews choose.&quot; The Muslim student population is small but has increased dramatically in size in recent years, and a Muslim Student Association formed at Elon in 2011. The Hindu population has also increased in size, Hindu festivals are now part of the university calendar, and Hindu students report feeling accepted at Elon.

Elon worked closely with the Interfaith Youth Core in developing religious diversity and interreligious dialogue. The Truitt Center for Spiritual and Religious Life, located within the Numen Lumen Pavilion of the Academic Village, serves a wide variety of purposes and all religious traditions.

===Fraternity and sorority life===
Elon University recognizes 26 social Greek organizations. Forty-two percent of undergraduate students belong to campus-chartered organizations.

===Student traditions===
At the start of each school year, Elon University holds a New Student Convocation ceremony for first year and transfer students. It is held &quot;Under the Oaks&quot; behind the West Dormitory. Each new student receives their own acorn at the close of the ceremony to symbolize their beginning at Elon. Upon graduation, each student receives an oak sapling, which is supposed to symbolize their growth at the university as well as the growth in their own lives. The use of the acorn and oak sapling is significant because Elon was named after the Hebrew word for &quot;oak&quot; (, ) because of the grove of oak trees it was founded on. The Oak Sapling tradition began in 1991, and the Acorn tradition began in 1999 after Leo Lambert became president of the university.

<doc id="1001127" wikidata="Q7738514" url="?curid=1001127" title="The Gulf War Did Not Take Place">
<text>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place () is a collection of three short essays by Jean Baudrillard published in the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; and British paper &quot;The Guardian&quot; between January and March 1991.

While the author acknowledges that the events and violence of what has been called the Gulf War took place, he asks if the events that took place were really as they were presented, and whether they could be called a war. The title is a reference to the play &quot;The Trojan War Will Not Take Place&quot; by Jean Giraudoux (in which characters attempt to prevent what the audience knows is inevitable).

== Essays==
* Part 1, &quot;The Gulf War will not take place&quot; (&quot;La guerre du Golfe n&#x27;aura pas lieu&quot;) was published in &quot;Libération&quot; on January 4, 1991.
* Part 2, &quot;The Gulf War is not really taking place&quot; (&quot;La guerre du Golfe a-t-elle vraiment lieu?&quot;) was published in &quot;Libération&quot; on February 6, 1991, and
* Part 3, &quot;The Gulf War did not take place&quot; (&quot;La Guerre du Golfe n&#x27;a pas eu lieu&quot;) was published in &quot;Libération&quot; on March 29, 1991.

The essays in &quot;Libération&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; were published before, during and after the Gulf War and they were titled accordingly: during the American military and rhetorical buildup as &quot;The Gulf War Will Not Take Place&quot;; during military action as &quot;The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place&quot;, and after action was over, &quot;The Gulf War Did Not Take Place&quot;. A book of elongated versions of the truncated original articles in French was published in May 1991. The English translation was published in early 1995 translated by Paul Patton.

== Summary ==
Baudrillard argued the Gulf War was not really a war, but rather an atrocity which &quot;masqueraded&quot; as a war. Using overwhelming airpower, the American military for the most part did not directly engage in combat with the Iraqi army, and suffered few casualties. Almost nothing was made known about Iraqi deaths. Thus, the fighting &quot;did not really take place&quot; from the point of view of the West. Moreover, all that spectators got to know about the war was in the form of propaganda imagery. The closely watched media presentations made it impossible to distinguish between the experience of what truly happened in the conflict, and its stylized, selective misrepresentation through &quot;simulacra&quot;.

Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature, wrote a comment about the November 2015 Paris attacks on Aljazeera.com entitled &quot;The Paris attacks did not take place&quot;, in which he criticized how global media outlets like BBC had made up a hyperreal simulacrum of Paris. He believes that after the bombardment of Arabian countries by the West, refugees had flooded into Europe, changing its geography. While what used to happen in the East was eventually experienced in the West, shattering the imaginary &quot;West-East&quot; dichotomy, the global media outlets, however, focused overwhelmingly on Paris itself, as though it was independent of the rest of the world. He believes that the terrorist attacks did happen, but not in the hyperreal way depicted by the media like BBC.

=== Russo-Ukrainian war ===
Jarryd Bartle, a lecturer of social context, and Kong Degang, a literature and art scholar, cited Baudrillard&#x27;s argument that &quot;The Gulf War Did Not Take Place&quot; and compared it to the ongoing Russian attack on Ukraine.

Jarryd Bartle published his essay on UnHerd. He said that Baudrillard&#x27;s opinion, once too postmodern to be accepted, was more relevant than ever in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Amidst the &quot;spectacle&quot; (as in &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;) of the newsfeeds, people consumed information by piecing them up and fabricating their own virtual perspectives. Some even started imagining an outbreak of &quot;World War III&quot;. He pointed out that while many commentators criticized the spread of misinformation, most lost sight of the harm of information overload and virtualisation.

Kong Degang, a Chinese scholar, compared the defense of Sihang Warehouse as featured in the Chinese film &quot;The Eight Hundred&quot;, the Gulf War as written about by Baudrillard, to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. He analyzed that in &quot;The Eight Hundred&quot;, the battle against the Japanese invaders is depicted as a &quot;performance&quot; intended to be watched by Shanghai citizens and the international community. From the audience&#x27;s perspective, the Japanese invaders won the battle but lost the war in the &quot;performance&quot; due to their unrighteousness. But this was not the exact case in history since no one back then was able to predict the outcome of the war judging merely by a battle. The Russo-Ukrainian war, on the other hand, unfolded quite differently from both the defense of Sihang Warehouse and the Gulf War. The latest technologies enabled the media to provide a myriad of real-time simulacra which completely dwarf those of the Gulf War in both realness and virtualness, which also led to information overload. With no way to (in)validate the war updates, people soon got tired of the factual aspect of the war, as though it &quot;did not take place&quot;; But meanwhile, people willingly engage in a &quot;cyber simulacra war&quot; that is &quot;constantly taking place&quot;. Both sides perform their &quot;justness&quot; and declare their own victories. But there exist actual losers who never participate in this simulacra war: Ukrainian civilians, eastern Ukraine residents, foreigners in Ukraine, normal Russian citizens affected by sanctions, and even people in their war-afflicted homelands overlooked by the international community: Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, etc..

=== Israel-Gaza war ===
In November 2023, writer Kubra Solmaz argued that Baudrillard&#x27;s writing about the creation of a hyper-reality through the replacement of the real situation in the Gulf War with representations that do not show the reality could also be applied to the Israel–Hamas war, which had started the month prior. She argues that the media reality around the war is fundamentally different than the material reality, using the dissonance between the media produced by Western media outlets, and that produced by the Palestinians within Gaza as the chief example.

<doc id="1001128" wikidata="Q4703693" url="?curid=1001128" title="Al Columbia">
<text>Al Columbia (born 1970) is an American artist known for his horror and black humor-themed alternative comics. His published works include the comic book series &quot;The Biologic Show&quot;, the graphic novel/art book &quot;Pim &amp; Francie: The Golden Bear Days&quot;, and short stories such as &quot;I Was Killing When Killing Wasn&#x27;t Cool&quot; and &quot;The Trumpets They Play!&quot;. He also works in other media including painting, illustration, printmaking, photography, music, and film.

==Career==

===&quot;Big Numbers&quot;===

At the age of 18 Columbia was hired to assist Bill Sienkiewicz in illustrating Alan Moore&#x27;s ambitious &quot;Big Numbers&quot; series. When Sienkiewicz withdrew from the series in 1990 after the release of the first two issues, Moore and his backers at Tundra Publishing asked Columbia to become its sole artist. In 1992, Columbia left the project after accusations that he had destroyed his own artwork for &quot;Big Numbers&quot; #4. Columbia declined to address the subject publicly for several years, writing in a 1998 letter to &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; that &quot;I could easily launch into a tirade about the extensive horror of my Tundra experience, but I much prefer the very entertaining and conflicting accounts already in circulation.&quot; In later statements he confirmed that he destroyed his artwork for the series but disputed additional claims by the other principal figures in the fiasco.

In a 2011 article reflecting on his &quot;Big Numbers&quot; experience, Sienkiewicz wrote that he and Columbia had long since reconciled over the matter, and that he was content to &quot;[c]halk the feud up to the folly of youth.&quot;

===1990s===
Columbia&#x27;s first published works appeared in the horror anthology &quot;From Beyonde&quot; in 1991, initially under the pseudonym &quot;Lucien&quot; and then under his real name. Tundra sponsored the publication of his first solo comic book, the slight but lavishly produced &quot;Doghead&quot;, in 1992. In 1993 the British magazine &quot;Deadline&quot; published his stories &quot;The Biologic Show&quot; and &quot;Tar Frogs: A Pim and Francie Adventure&quot;. 

In 1994 Fantagraphics Books published Columbia&#x27;s comic &quot;The Biologic Show&quot; #0, which contained revised versions of the two &quot;Deadline&quot; pieces along with new stories in a similar vein. It received reviews and praise from other cartoonists including Mike Allred and Jim Woodring. &quot;The Biologic Show&quot; #1 followed in 1995, featuring the first part of a never-continued Pim and Francie serial, &quot;Peloria&quot;; an issue #2 was advertised but never appeared. Also in 1995, &quot;I Was Killing When Killing Wasn&#x27;t Cool&quot; became the first of a series of two color short stories by Columbia to appear in the Fantagraphics anthology &quot;Zero Zero&quot;. In these works he adopted a streamlined drawing style evocative of early animated cartoons, particularly the works of Fleischer Studios. In later stories such as &quot;Amnesia&quot; (1997) and &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1999) Columbia combined these stylized character drawings with minutely detailed chiaroscuro backgrounds created using mixed media (including watercolor, acrylic paint, ink, and charcoal) and digital tools. &quot;The Trumpets They Play!&quot;, a widely lauded work in this style based on the Book of Revelation, appeared in &quot;BLAB!&quot; #10 in 1998. In addition to his own creations, Columbia did color separations for the publications of other cartoonists including Chris Ware (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;), Archer Prewitt (&quot;Sof&#x27; Boy and Friends&quot;), and Catherine Doherty (&quot;Can of Worms&quot;).

Although Columbia gave occasional interviews during this period, the small quantity of his published output and the cancellation of several titles and anthology contributions, compounded with lingering questions about the fate of &quot;Big Numbers&quot;, made him an object of much speculation. &quot;Whatever happened to Al Columbia?&quot; was such a perennial question on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;&#x27;s online message board that it eventually became an in-joke referenced in later press coverage.

===2000s===
Columbia&#x27;s career was punctuated by several prominent appearances in non-comics media, including set designs for David Cross&#x27;s 1999 comedy special &quot;The Pride is Back&quot;, a post-9/11 illustration for the &quot;New York Times&quot; Letters page, and, in 2003, artwork for The Postal Service&#x27;s platinum-selling album &quot;Give Up&quot;. In the comics realm, following a pair of covers for &quot;Zero Zero&quot;&#x27;s final issue (#27, August 2000) and a small handful of pieces for other anthologies, his artwork stopped appearing in print for several years after 2002. He contributed solely as a writer to 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Pogostick&quot;, a series about a mentally disturbed office worker illustrated by Ethan Persoff. &quot;The Pogostick&quot; earned a Harvey Award nomination for Best New Series but was left unfinished after two issues. A personal website, alcolumbia.com, appeared the same year with a &quot;Coming Soon&quot; sign but lay dormant for several years. It eventually emerged in 2006 as a Flash-based site hosting a shifting assortment of ephemeral content including artwork, photographs, music, and videos, along with numerous teasers for works that would remain unreleased, unfinished, or possibly nonexistent.

Columbia returned to a degree of public visibility in 2007 with an exhibition of original artwork at Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Floating World Comics, an interview on Robin McConnell&#x27;s &quot;Inkstuds&quot; radio show, and the first of six appearances in the comics quarterly &quot;Mome&quot;. Between 2008 and 2010 he produced a pair of short-lived comic strips for the Alvin Buenaventura-edited comics pages of the magazines &quot;Arthur&quot; and &quot;The Believer&quot;.

In 2009 Fantagraphics released Columbia&#x27;s most expansive work to date: &quot;Pim &amp; Francie: The Golden Bear Days&quot;, a 240-page assemblage of fragmentary comics and illustrations drawn over a period of more than ten years. It received widespread critical acclaim and earned him two Ignatz Award nominations. His &quot;Mome&quot; short story &quot;5:45 A.M.&quot; was also featured in the 2009 edition of &quot;The Best American Comics&quot;.

===2010–present===
Columbia continued to contribute short pieces for publication through the 2010s, mostly to small press anthologies. His original drawings and paintings appeared for sale in online marketplaces, along with limited edition prints issued by various commercial partners. Some of this non-comics work saw publication in the pages of the contemporary art magazine &quot;Hi-Fructose&quot; and on its website. 

In 2018 Columbia returned with &quot;&quot;, a collection of posters for the imaginary cartoons of a fictional Golden Age animation studio.

Alcolumbia.com closed in early 2012 and was replaced the following year by orangesunshinehouse.com, featuring a similar mixture of Flash-based content. In 2017 the site moved to a new domain, orangesunshinemedicine.com, before disappearing in 2019. In July 2021 Columbia launched an Instagram account featuring his artwork and photographs.

In 2020 Hollow Press published a hardcover collection of &quot;The Biologic Show&quot;, reproducing both issues of the out-of-print comic along with a pair of related early works, in English and Italian language editions. Paris-based comics publisher Huber Éditions released a French language version of &quot;Pim &amp; Francie: The Golden Bear Days&quot; in 2021.

==Recurring characters==
From &quot;The Biologic Show&quot; onwards Columbia&#x27;s comics have featured several recurring characters who continue to reappear despite having been killed multiple times.

* Seymour Sunshine: A frequent protagonist in Columbia&#x27;s early work, Seymour Sunshine is a timid, passive manchild who resembles Koko the Clown. He first appeared in the story &quot;No Tomorrow If I Must Return&quot; in &quot;The Biologic Show&quot; #0. Other stories featuring the character include &quot;I Was Killing When Killing Wasn&#x27;t Cool&quot;, &quot;Amnesia&quot;, and &quot;The Trumpets They Play!&quot;.

* Pim and Francie: A pair of impish waifs whose antics get them into horrific trouble, Pim and Francie first appeared in the story &quot;Tar Frogs&quot; and are the protagonists in &quot;Peloria Part One&quot; and &quot;Pim &amp; Francie: The Golden Bear Days&quot;. The two have a loosely-defined friend/lover/sibling relationship. According to Columbia they were originally modeled on him and his former girlfriend as cartoon characters before taking on a life of their own.

* Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy: Described in the story &quot;Amnesia&quot; as a &quot;childish icon for mischievous and filthy pleasures,&quot; Knishkebibble was introduced in &quot;Peloria Part One&quot;. In later appearances he acted as Seymour Sunshine&#x27;s sidekick, serving mostly to drag both of them into dangerous situations. He is greedy, conniving, and vulgar, and usually speaks with a hillbilly accent.

==Music and film==
In the 1990s Columbia was a founding member of the band The Action Suits, whose other members included fellow Fantagraphics cartoonists Peter Bagge and Eric Reynolds. Although he did not play on any of the band&#x27;s recordings, he created the artwork for their 1997 single &quot;Glazed Donuts&quot;. Columbia&#x27;s own musical recordings with various collaborators have appeared sporadically on his websites and on streaming platforms including YouTube and Vimeo; none have been released commercially. He has also directed short films and music videos, including one in 2009 for the song &quot;These Wounds Never Heal&quot; by the American heavy metal band Unholy.

Columbia&#x27;s story &quot;5:45 A.M.&quot; provided the basis for a scene in director Santiago Menghini&#x27;s 2014 short film &quot;Intruders&quot;, which was screened at various North American venues including the Toronto International Film Festival.

==Influence==
Gerard Way, author of &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot; and lead singer of the band My Chemical Romance, described his exposure to Columbia&#x27;s work as &quot;a turning point&quot; in the development of his own sensibility. Other artists and musicians who have cited Columbia as an inspiration include Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Camille Rose Garcia, Dwid Hellion of Integrity, Frances Bean Cobain, and Esao Andrews.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; magazine&#x27;s Evan Pricco, illustrator Aaron Horkey asserted that &quot;countless successful artists continue to pillage [Columbia&#x27;s] back catalog, propping up their half-baked careers on the well-worn spines of second hand copies of &quot;Biologic Show&quot;.&quot;

<text>Microsoft Campus Agreement (MSCA) is a program intended to offer significant discounts on Microsoft products to students, faculty, and staff of select universities which enter into a yearly contract with Microsoft. (Windows XP Professional sells, at some University stores, for as low as $10.00 .) Each software package available under the MSCA can be purchased only once. Upon graduation, students can typically receive perpetual licenses for the purchased software.

== Current arrangement ==
Software sold under MSCA licenses included Windows XP Professional, versions of Microsoft Office and the Visual Studio .NET suite of developer tools.

Additionally, MSCA licensing required those who purchased Windows XP Professional have an existing Windows license and allowed for Office products to be installed on, at most, two computers.

== Legacy licenses ==
Prior to 2003, MSCA licensed software was distinguishable from non-MSCA licensed software in that the CDs were not holographic, did not require activation (for those products which would have otherwise required activation), and, in some cases, did not require a valid license key.

== Examples of participating universities ==
* Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi
* Ball State University
* California State University
* Community Colleges of Spokane
* DeVry University
*Federal University of Viçosa
* Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
* Iowa State University
* Lancaster University
* Life Pacific College
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology
* Norwegian University of Science and Technology
* Morrisville State College
* Oklahoma State University

* University of Chicago
* University of Connecticut
* University of Florida
* University of Houston
*University of Iowa
* University of Leeds
* University of Texas at Austin
* University of Twente
* Worcester Polytechnic Institute
* University of Westminster
* Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas (ICUT), representing approximately forty Texas institutions of higher learning, entered an annual Consortium Campus agreement beginning in 2000 to provide all member institutions with MSCA access. ICUT members represent over 85,000 full-time students and nearly 30,000 part-time students. Some members are listed below:
**Abilene Christian University
**Baylor University
**Beijing Jiaotong University
**Dallas Baptist University
**Hardin-Simmons University

<text>Yano is a Filipino folk/punk rock band formed in 1993. The band members were originally composed of Dong Abay on vocals and Eric Gancio on guitar. Onie Badiang later joined them to play bass. Nowie Favila was the usual drummer but declined to join the group due to commitments with Ang Grupong Pendong. Other drummers of the band included Nonong Timbalopez, Harley Alarcon and Jun Nogoy. The band got their name when Abay looked through an entry in &quot;Talahulugang Pilipino&quot;, an old Tagalog dictionary. &quot;Yano&quot; in Tagalog means &quot;&quot;, similar to modern Tagalog term &quot;payák&quot;. In dialectal Tagalog, the term &quot;yano&quot; may also mean &quot;extreme&quot;, and usually by extension, &quot;kayanuhan&quot; may also mean &quot;state of being right quality, kind, size, class, etc.&quot; The term is often used by Tagalog speakers in the province of Quezon. The group disbanded in 1997 after Abay left the band. Eric Gancio reformed Yano in 2007.

In 2007, Eric Gancio revived Yano as a one-man band, although he continued to use sidemen as backing musicians for live performances. In 2013, Yano released their fourth studio album titled &quot;Talâ &quot;(Star). As of 2022, Yano&#x27;s Current Power Trio composed of Eric Gancio - Vocals/ Lead Guitars, Charlie Comendador - Bass, Jan Najera - Drums

==History==
On June 30, 1994, the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album came out, with rock songs including &quot;Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo&quot;. The band promoted the album through a series of appearances and gigs in various clubs and campuses, as well as a successful Radio tour.

===Yano continues===
In the middle of the recording of their third album &#x27;Tara&#x27;, Abay struggled with clinical depression and stayed in his bedroom for about three years. Gancio finished the album alone, singing the vocal tracks to have of the album&#x27;s songs.

Abay came out of depression while writing new songs set into poetry. He and Badiang formed another band, Pan. They released their debut album entitled &quot;Parnaso ng Payaso&quot; in 2003. Pan was later disbanded because Abay went back to school in University of the Philippines Diliman. He released &quot;Sampol&quot;, an EP in 2005, which was later reborn into &quot;Flipino&quot; and released in May 2006. Badiang played bass for Filipino folk/rock band Asin.

===Yano in Davao===
Gancio returned to his homeland in Davao after finishing the recording of the third album &quot;Tara&quot; in 1998. In 2004, he released his solo album &quot;Sa Bandang Huli&quot; (At the Very End). Gancio did all the instruments in his indie-released album and mixed the music at his home in a PC-based software. In 2007, Gancio took into the band session Bassist Dave Ibao and Drummer Jan Najera. He said he would be releasing an album, which, according to Gancio, will be the &quot;fourth Yano album&quot; instead of his second album. Hence, in 2013, Yano released a fourth album titled &quot;Talâ &quot;(Star) under Yano Records. The band is still based in Davao City.

In September 2014, Yano released its fifth album &quot;Ya Hindi No&quot; under Yano Records. Yano has just launched it during P FEST UK on the last week of the same month in Leeds and Romford. In 2022, Jan Najera rejoined the band, together with Charlie Comendador as the new bassist.

==Music==
Yano&#x27;s music is a fusion of western elements into Filipino ethnic music. It is also known for their political and social themes. Their songs censure religious hypocrites like in &quot;Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo&quot; (Tagalog for &quot;Holy Dog, Saintly Horse&quot;), corrupt politicians in &quot;Trapo&quot; (colloquial, pejorative acronym for &quot;traditional politicians&quot;, also literally translates to &quot;dust rag&quot;), the lingo of the Philippine&#x27;s elite in &quot;Coño Ka P’re&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re a &quot;&quot;&quot;) and abusive capitalists in &quot;Mc’Jo&quot; (alluding to the fastfood chains McDonald&#x27;s and Jollibee.

Yano&#x27;s songs also narrate the situation of Philippine society during the 1990s. &quot;Kumusta Na?&quot; (&quot;How are you?&quot;) discusses the condition of the Filipino masses after the 1986 EDSA Revolution while the novelty-styled song &quot;Kaka&quot; tells a story of a person named Kaka, who is having difficulty in finding things in the dark after a power outage, a reference to the frequent blackouts in the Philippines during the early 1990s. The song &quot;Bawal&quot; (&quot;prohibited&quot;) speaks about the effects of rules or laws with excessive restrictions to the point where it leads to suppression of freedom and love. &quot;Abno&quot;, also known as &quot;Abnormal Environmental&quot;, tackles the environment while &quot;Kaklase&quot; (&quot;classmate&quot;) focuses on students facing maltreatment by their teachers. Another social relevant song, &quot;Mercy&quot;, tells about the story of a crazy peddler in the Philippines known as a &quot;taong grasa&quot; (&quot;greasy person&quot;).

<text>The Royal Game of Ur is a two-player strategy race board game of the tables family that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC. The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata, and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as Crete and Sri Lanka. One board, held by the British Museum, is dated to 2600 – c. 2400 BC, making it one of the oldest game boards in the world. 

The Royal Game of Ur is sometimes equated to another ancient game which it closely resembles, the Game of Twenty Squares.

At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player&#x27;s future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until late antiquity, when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, a form of tables game. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the Jewish population of the Indian city of Kochi, who continued playing a version of it called &#x27;Asha&#x27; until the 1950s when they began emigrating to Israel.

The Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley during his excavations of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. A partial description in cuneiform of the rules of the Game of Ur as played in the second century BC has been preserved on a Babylonian clay tablet written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-balāṭu. 

Based on this tablet and the shape of the , Irving Finkel, a British Museum curator, reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one&#x27;s pieces off before one&#x27;s opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and luck.

== History ==
The Game of Ur was popular across the Middle East and boards for it have been found in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Cyprus and Crete. Four gameboards bearing a very close resemblance to the Royal Game of Ur were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. These boards came with small boxes to store dice and game pieces and many had senet boards on the reverse sides so that the same board could be used to play either game and merely had to be flipped over. 

The game was popular among all social classes. A graffito version of the game carved with a sharp object, possibly a dagger, was discovered on one of the human-headed winged bull gate sentinels from the palace of Sargon II (721–705 BC) in the city of Khorsabad.

The Game of Ur eventually acquired superstitious significance and the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu provides vague predictions for the players&#x27; futures if they land on certain spaces, such as &quot;You will find a friend&quot;, &quot;You will become powerful like a lion&quot;, or &quot;You will draw fine beer&quot;. People saw relationships between a player&#x27;s success in the game and their success in real life. Seemingly random events, such as landing on a certain square, were interpreted as messages from deities, ghosts of deceased ancestors, or from a person&#x27;s own soul.

A 2013 study of nearly one hundred well-dated game boards across the Near East shows significant changes over 1,200 years of time in the layout of squares on the board. This indicates that game rules and game play were not static, but changed over time. The study further shows the game was transmitted from Mesopotamia to the Levant around 1800 BC, from the Levant to Egypt around 1600 BC where it picked up small innovations in board design (additional squares), and from Egypt or the Levant to Cyprus and Nubia. Several apparently failed innovations in board design also appear (i.e., only one example of a specific board design is known from the archaeological record).

It is unclear what led to the Game of Ur&#x27;s eventual decline during late antiquity. One theory holds that it evolved into backgammon; whereas another holds that early forms of backgammon eclipsed the Game of Ur in popularity, causing players to eventually forget about the older game. At some point before the game fell out of popularity in the Middle East, it was apparently introduced to the Indian city of Kochi by a group of Jewish merchants. 

Members of the Jewish population of Kochi were still playing a recognizable form of the Game of Ur, which they called &quot;Aasha&quot;, by the time they started emigrating to Israel in the 1950s after World War II. The Kochi version of the game had twenty squares, just like the original Mesopotamian version, but each player had twelve pieces rather than seven, and the placement of the twenty squares was slightly different.

== Modern rediscovery ==
The British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley discovered five gameboards of the Game of Ur during his excavation of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Because the game was first discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, it became known as the &quot;Royal Game of Ur&quot;, but later archaeologists uncovered other copies of the game from other locations across the Middle East. The boards discovered by Woolley date to around 2,600–2,400 BC.

All five boards were of an identical type, but they were made of different materials and had different decorations. Woolley reproduced images of two of these boards in his 1949 book, &quot;The First Phases&quot;. One of these is a relatively simple set with a background composed of discs of shell with blue or red centers set in wood-covered bitumen. The other is a more elaborate one completely covered with shell plaques, inlaid with red limestone and lapis lazuli. Other gameboards are often engraved with images of animals.

=== Reconstruction ===
When the Game of Ur was first discovered, no one knew how it was played. Then, in the early 1980s, Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum, translated a clay tablet written 177 BC by the Babylonian scribe Itti-Marduk-balāṭu describing how the game was played during that time period, based on an earlier description of the rules by another scribe named Iddin-Bēl. This tablet was written during the waning days of Babylonian civilization, long after the time when the Game of Ur was first played. 

It had been discovered in 1880 in the ruins of Babylon and sold to the British Museum. Finkel also used photographs of another tablet describing the rules, which had been in the personal collection of Count Aymar de Liedekerke-Beaufort, but was destroyed during World War I. 

This second tablet was undated, but is believed by archaeologists to have been written several centuries earlier than the tablet by Itti-Marduk-balāṭu and to have originated from the city of Uruk. The backs of both tablets show diagrams of the gameboard, clearly indicating which game they are describing. Based on these rules and the shape of the gameboard, Finkel was able to reconstruct how the game might have been played.

=== Basic rules ===
The Game of Ur is a race game and it is probably an ancestor of the tables family of games that are still played today and include backgammon. The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven game pieces, similar to those used in draughts or checkers. One set of pieces is white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots. The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined by a &quot;narrow bridge&quot; of two boxes. 

The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy. Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice. Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up. The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn. A single game can last up to half an hour.

The objective of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course and off the board before their opponent. On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, suggesting that one side of the board belongs to one player and the opposite side to the other player. When a piece is on one of the player&#x27;s own squares, it is safe from capture. 

When it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent&#x27;s pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning. This means there are six &quot;safe&quot; squares and eight &quot;combat&quot; squares. There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player&#x27;s mobility.

When a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game. A player is not required to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity. Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.

All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row. According to Finkel&#x27;s reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. Finkel also states that when a piece lands on any of the three rosettes, the player gets an extra roll.

In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one. If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board. Once a player removes all their pieces off the board in this manner, that player wins the game.

=== Gambling ===
One archaeological dig uncovered twenty-one white balls alongside a set of the Game of Ur. It is believed that these balls were probably used for placing wagers. According to the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, whenever a player skips one of the boxes marked with a rosette, they must place a token in the pot. If a player lands on a rosette, they may take a token from the pot.
== Game of Twenty ==
The &quot;Game of Twenty&quot; or &quot;Game of Twenty Squares&quot; is another ancient tables game similar to the Royal Game of Ur. Egyptian gaming boxes often have a board for this game on the opposite side to that for the better-known game of senet. It dates roughly to the period from 1500 BC to 300 BC and is known to have been played in the region that includes Babylon, Mesopotamia and Persia, as well as Egypt. The board comprises two distinct sections; a quadrant of 3 × 4 squares, like that in the Ur game, and a row or &#x27;arm&#x27; of 8 squares projecting from the central row of the quadrant. It has five rosettes. The rules are not precisely known but it appears likely that players entered all their 5 pieces onto the arm and aimed to bear them off from the sides of the quadrant, perhaps having contested the arm by hitting opposing pieces off.
