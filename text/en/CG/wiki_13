<text>Nauka (), also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module, Upgrade (MLM-U, ), is the primary laboratory of the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station (ISS). Serving alongside the &quot;Rassvet&quot; and &quot;Poisk&quot; mini-research modules, Nauka conducts scientific experiments and stores research equipment.

Originally built as a backup for &quot;Zarya&quot;, the very first module of the ISS, &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s construction was halted in the late 1990s, when it was about 70% complete. After exploring various options, Roscosmos decided to convert the partially completed module into a laboratory. While the initial target launch date was set for 2007, and outfitting equipment for Nauka was delivered by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; in 2010 attached to the &quot;Rassvet&quot; module, numerous delays and technical issues delayed the launch by 14 years.

&quot;Nauka&quot; finally launched on 21 July 2021 at 14:58:25UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome atop a Proton-M rocket. Like most of the Russian modules, &quot;Nauka&quot; operated autonomously and after a flight lasting about eight days, &quot;Nauka&quot; docked to the nadir (Earth facing) port of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module on 29 July 2021 at 13:29:01UTC. However, after docking, a software glitch led the module&#x27;s thrusters to keep firing, causing the entire space station to flip over one and a half times, before the module ran out of fuel. The crew was able to null the rotation, and return the station to its normal orientation. While the situation was tense and NASA declared a &quot;spacecraft emergency,&quot; they later said that the situation did not endanger the lives of the ISS crew.

The addition of &quot;Nauka&quot; is the first major expansion of the Russian Orbital Segment in over 20 years. Cosmonauts would conduct twelve spacewalks over two years outfitting the module with equipment, much of it brought aboard the &quot;Rassvet&quot; module in 2010 and &quot;Prichal&quot;, a multi-port docking module was added to &quot;Nauka&quot; in November 2021.

== Description ==
&quot;Nauka&quot; is the primary laboratory of the Russian Orbital Segment, operating in conjunction with the Mini-Research Modules &quot;Rassvet&quot; and &quot;Poisk&quot;. It is used to conduct experiments and store scientific instruments, and can also serve as a backup service module for the ISS. &quot;Nauka&quot; is based on the Functional Cargo Block (FGB) design. It is long and wide, and is made of stainless steel, aluminium alloy, kevlar, and ceramic-wool insulation, totalling a mass of .

&quot;Nauka&quot; has two SSVP-M docking ports; the passive nadir port is used to attach &quot;Prichal&quot; to the station, while the active zenith port is used to attach &quot;Nauka&quot; itself to the station via &quot;Zvezda&quot;″s nadir port. SSVP-M is a hybrid variant of the SSVP docking system that combines its traditional probe‑and‑drogue soft-capture mechanism with the APAS-95 hard-docking collar. While this is incompatible with Soyuz and Progress&#x27; standard SSVP-G ports, a temporary docking adapter SSVPA-GM that converts &quot;Nauka&quot;″s nadir port from SSVP-M to SSVP-G was installed to allow them to dock. This adapter was removed upon the arrival of &quot;Prichal&quot; because, although it is the second module after &quot;Rassvet&quot; to use a port initially used by Soyuz or Progress spacecraft, it is not able to dock to SSVP-G ports like the &quot;Rassvet&quot; module. As a result, the &quot;Prichal&quot; module with its active hybrid docking port was only able to dock to the reconfigured port. With its docking, the number of docking ports on the ISS Russian Orbital Segment increased to eight. Another one was an Active AS-G forward port to allow the Airlock ShK module to berth with Nauka.

Full guidance and navigation control, enabled by an attitude control system using MDDK thrusters, provide roll control to the station using its advantageous position far from the station&#x27;s fore-aft axis, which provides the greatest mechanical advantage for roll corrections of all the station&#x27;s thruster-equipped modules. &quot;Nauka&quot; is also able to collect and store propellant delivered by Progress spacecraft and transfer it to &quot;Zvezda&quot;.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s (ESA) European Robotic Arm located on &quot;Nauka&quot;″s exterior enables the installation, removal or replacement of external experiment payloads; the transfer of payloads through the science airlock; and visual inspections of the station. It can support spacewalks by providing foot restraints, tether points, and control panels both on the inside and outside of the station. &quot;Nauka&quot; contains life support equipment including an oxygen production system capable of supporting six crew, a galley, a toilet with a urine recycling system, and one of the three sleep stations aboard the Russian Orbital Segment. There is a large observation window similar to Destiny&#x27;s nadir window for the crew on the aft side of the docking sphere, towards the nadir port, while one 9-inch-wide window hatch is on the forward port for the airlock module, similar to the two windows on the Kibo Pressurized Module.
===Science (or Experiment) Airlock ShK===

The airlock, Shk, is designed for a payload with dimensions up to , has a volume of , weight of 1050 kg and consumes 1.5 kW of power at the peak. Prior to berthing the MLM to the ISS, the airlock was stowed as part of MRM1. On 4 May 2023, 01:00 UTC, the chamber was moved by the ERA manipulator and berthed to the forward active docking port of the pressurized docking hub of the Nauka module. It is intended to be used:
*for extracting payloads from the MLM docking adapter and placing them on the outer surface of the station;
*enable science investigations to be removed, exposed to the external space environment, then returned inside while being maneuvered with the European robotic arm.
*for receiving payloads from the ERA manipulator and moving them into the internal volume of the airlock and further into the MLM pressurized adapter;
*for conducting scientific experiments in the internal volume of the airlock;
*for conducting scientific experiments outside the lock chamber on an extended table and in a special organized place.
*for launching cubesats into space, with the aid of ERAvery similar to the Japanese airlock and Nanoracks Bishop Airlock on the U.S. segment of the station.

== Development ==

In the 1990s, Roscosmos&#x27; original plan for the Russian Orbital Segment included two Russian Research Modules and a Universal Docking Module based on the FGB design to be located at &quot;Zvezda&quot;″s nadir port. A backup flight article for FGB-based &quot;Zarya&quot;, known in production as FGB-2, was originally planned to serve as the Universal Docking Module, though its construction had been halted at 70% completion in the late 1990s. By August 2004, Roscosmos decided to scrap the two research modules in favour of flying FGB-2 as a single research module known as &quot;Nauka&quot;. A joint Astrotech-Energia concept for a Commercial Enterprise Module-based &quot;Nauka&quot;, proposed to Roscosmos around this time, was rejected. In 2005, Roscosmos brokered a deal with the ESA to launch their European Robotic Arm with &quot;Nauka&quot;, with its spare elbow joint to launch with &quot;Rassvet&quot;.

While Roscosmos had originally hoped &quot;Nauka&quot; would be ready for launch by 2007, multiple delays pushed the prospective launch date back progressively to 2014. Acceptance tests of &quot;Nauka&quot; in late 2013 found leaks in the propulsion system&#x27;s fueling valve and contamination, so Energia returned the module to Khrunichev for twelve to eighteen months of repairs. &quot;Nauka&quot;″s prospective 2015 launch was delayed again after more fuel valve leaks damaged the module&#x27;s exterior plumbing, necessitating its replacement. Metallic dust contamination in the module&#x27;s fuel tanks in 2017 caused three more years of delays, as initial repairs were unsuccessful, and the installation of a new single-use fuel system based on the Fregat upper stage was considered as a solution. However, in late 2019, the original tanks were successfully repaired, rendering the planned Fregat-based tanks redundant and paving the way for a 2019 or 2020 launch.

Targeting an early-to-mid-2020 launch, &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s Proton-M launch vehicle was assembled and shipped to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in February. However, &quot;Nauka&quot; needed another fuel tank valve replacement, along with further tests necessitated by an expiring warranty following years of delays. The testing – which could only take place at Energia in Russia instead of Kazakhstan, where Baikonur is located – was completed in May 2020, around the same time the new fuel tank valves were shipped to Baikonur. Efforts to launch &quot;Nauka&quot; were affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe in early 2020, which led to suspension of all work in March, April, and July, and a sizeable reduction in workforce throughout the year, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of the disease. &quot;Nauka&quot; finally arrived in Baikonur in August 2020, along with its solar panels and the European Robotic Arm shortly afterwards. The loading of cargo and supplies onto &quot;Nauka&quot; began on 11 September 2020, while its MMOD armor and batteries were installed. Throughout October and November 2020, Expedition 65 cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Oleg Novitsky, who were to be responsible for &quot;Nauka&quot;″s installation to the station in orbit via numerous extravehicular activities, conducted two Crew Equipment Interface Tests during which the module was powered on for the first time with various components deployed, and the cosmonauts inspected and toured the vehicle&#x27;s exterior.

By November 2020, &quot;Nauka&quot; had been put through 306 of the 754 tests needed before it could be processed for launch, and by January 2021 80% of the tests were complete. Throughout January and February, &quot;Nauka&quot;″s tanks, thrusters, and automated docking system underwent final testing, along with the European Robotic Arm. In March, two more Crew Equipment Interface Tests with Dubrov and Novitsky took place, and &quot;Nauka&quot;″s launch was delayed one final time from May to July 2021, following further COVID-19-related restrictions and complications with traffic on the International Space Station. In May, &quot;Nauka&quot; passed Roscosmos&#x27; flight readiness review, underwent a final round of pressurization and leak tests, and the SSVP docking adapter, the solar panels, and the European Robotic Arm were attached to the module&#x27;s exterior. One final Crew Equipment Interface Test was conducted with cosmonaut Aleksandr Skvortsov and his backup Sergey Prokopyev before &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s encapsulation in the Proton-M&#x27;s payload fairing in June. On 28 June, &quot;Nauka&quot; was successfully mated with its Proton-M launch vehicle and rolled out to Site 200 on 17 July.

== Launch ==
On 2 May 2021, the launch schedule was posted online; it involved the launch of Progress MS-17 on 30 June to deliver outfitting hardware to the station and plugs to fix the leak in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module. Before it docked, Novitsky and Dubrov performed a spacewalk to remove equipment and cables from &quot;Pirs&quot; in preparation for undocking. Site 200, from which &quot;Nauka&quot; and its Proton-M were to launch, were modified to supply chilled air and fuel the vehicle as it sat on the pad; the same modifications were made to Site 81 when &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;Zarya&quot;, and &quot;Zvezda&quot; were launched from it. On 7 June, work at Site 200 was completed in preparation for the assembly of the launch vehicle and the rollout of &quot;Nauka&quot; to Pad 39 at the facility.

On 30 June 2021, fueling began, but a problem with the spacecraft&#x27;s guidance sensors was detected and &quot;Nauka&quot; was rolled back to the instrumentation and test facility at Site 254. The upper fairing was removed and rolled away while workers using safety harnesses changed and replaced the sensors and reinstalled the MLI. On 1 July, more imperfections were found requiring a full scrub down and systems had to be removed and replaced. On 3 July, the fairing was reattached and &quot;Nauka&quot; was powered on to test the sensors before it was reloaded onto the transfer car and redelivered to the airlock where it was placed on a flatcar for delivery to Site 31 for fueling.

On 9 July 2021, ILS completed stacking of the Proton rocket at Site 200 and all three of the lower stages were fueled and standing by for the arrival of &quot;Nauka&quot;. Because of delays with rewrapping the sensors, rollout was scheduled for 17 July with launch on the 21st. Also on 9 July, teams from ILS, Khrunichev, Roscosmos, Energia, and Yuzhny Space Center conducted a dry countdown to test the new computers and systems at Site 200 which would control &quot;Nauka&quot; and feed it and the Proton rocket telemetry through the first 12 minutes of flight up until first stage separation and fairing jettison, where telemetry would be controlled from ground stations and from Mission Control Moscow. On 10 July, &quot;Nauka&quot; was fueled and the aft compartment was closed out in preparation for the transfer to Site 200 to be attached to the Proton rocket. Launch was scheduled for 21 July at 14:58 UTC.

On 13 July 2021, Novitsky and Dubrov carried out work on the &quot;Pirs&quot; module, splitting up the hydraulic circuit and module control communications via the Progress spacecraft, and checked the docking unit and its systems. In this process they closed the &quot;Pirs&quot; module hatch that was connected to the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module, after which &quot;Pirs&quot; was ultimately undocked on 23 July. Also on 13 July, Roscosmos revealed the mission patch for &quot;Nauka&quot; which was in the process of being painted on the fairing and on the Proton launch vehicle itself. A smaller mission patch was flown inside, attached to the wall with Velcro. On 14 July, Roscosmos revealed the website for &quot;Nauka&quot; and began the countdown for launch. A spacewalk was to be performed on 8 September by Novitsky and Dubrov to remove thermal shrouds for the ERA and the hardware launched on &quot;Rassvet&quot; including &quot;Nauka&quot;″s docking ball and the transfer compartment. This would free up ports for the Science airlock and the RTOd radiator and will allow the ERA to retrieve its boom which was stowed on the &quot;Rassvet&quot; module. When &quot;Nauka&quot; arrived, the ERA&#x27;s first task after the Russian spacewalk was to grapple the airlock and the radiator and install them, with Novitsky and Dubrov bolting them down and routing cables and piping in preparation for their deployment at the end of the spacewalk. On the same day, the Proton-M rocket received &quot;Nauka&quot; at Site 92. Rollout was slated for 17 July.

In the early morning hours of 17 July 2021, &quot;Nauka&quot; was loaded onto a rail transporter erector and was rolled out to Pad 39 at Site 200. Over the next few days &quot;Nauka&quot; was checked out before its launch on 21 July at 14:58 UTC. On 19 July, a launch dress rehearsal was conducted to test the systems. With 48 hours remaining in the launch window everything remained go for an on-time liftoff. On the station, &quot;Pirs&quot; was loaded with garbage and the hatch was closed and locked for the last time in preparation for undocking. On 20 July, &quot;Nauka&quot; had its final launch dress rehearsal, During which it was powered on and the Proton flight computer was activated to test the ground launch sequencer. While this was going on, technicians from Roscosmos and ILS connected the umbilical cables and fueling and vent lines to the rocket. After the Launch Readiness Review (LRR) in which Rogozin sat down with senior staff to conduct the go/no-go poll, the Proton was fueled and the countdown proceeded to launch. &quot;Nauka&quot; successfully lifted off from the pad on 21 July at 14:58:25 UTC.

== Transit phase and docking ==
Several problems occurred after the launch, including loss of telemetry and issues with the main propulsion system. On 22 July 2021, the &quot;Nauka&quot; Multipurpose Module Flight Control Group specialists at Mission Control Moscow conducted two correction maneuvers. The first maneuver took place at 15:07 UTC with the module engines&#x27; burn for 17.23 seconds giving an impulse of 1 m/s. The second burn for 250.04 seconds took place at 17:19 UTC with an impulse of 14.59 m/s. By then, the telemetry confirmed the propulsion system&#x27;s operability.

Additional burns for further orbit correction were scheduled for 23 July 2021. On 23 July, &quot;Nauka&quot; conducted the third and fourth burn in its approach. Because of the burn duration and &quot;Nauka&quot;″s location in orbit two more burns seemed needed to get it back into plane. Because of this the undocking of &quot;Pirs&quot; was pushed back by 12 hours with the new undocking time scheduled for 25 July.

By mid-day 24 July 2021, the issues with &quot;Nauka&quot; propulsion had further postponed the schedule for undocking &quot;Pirs&quot; by another day, to 26 July. On 26 July at 10:55 UTC, &quot;Pirs&quot; undocked from the ISS for the last time. Roscosmos sent the deorbit command and &quot;Pirs&quot; entered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean at 14:01 UTC in a 17-minute burn. Self-destruct came at 15:04 UTC and &quot;Pirs&quot; and the trash that was inside it burned up as it entered the atmosphere over the Pacific, the first ISS module to be decommissioned and destroyed.

Hours after undocking, Canadarm2 grappled &quot;Zarya&quot; and performed an inspection of &quot;Zvezda&quot;. No debris was detected and the latches were safely retracted. No additional spacewalk was needed and the space station was ready to receive &quot;Nauka&quot; on 29 July 2021.

On 27 July 2021, specialists of the &quot;Nauka&quot; flight control group at the Mission Control Center carried out a routine corrective maneuver for the module. The final orbit correction to put &quot;Nauka&quot; on a rendezvous path with ISS was performed on 28 July at 16:43:07 UTC with a single firing of the main engines.

On 29 July 2021, &quot;Nauka&quot; successfully automatically docked and was attached to the station at 13:29 UTC, and was put to work on the station by the crew.

== Post-docking activities ==
=== Thruster glitches after docking ===
A few hours after docking while the crew were performing leak checks in preparation for hatch opening, &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s onboard computers experienced a software glitch, due to which an erroneous direct command fired onboard thrusters, causing the ISS to rotate out of orientation unexpectedly. NASA and Roscosmos ground controllers worked to remotely fix the glitch issue, while at the same time instructing the crew to close all window shutters and stand-by for computer reboot. Controllers initially attempted to counteract the inadvertent thrust through the use of thrusters on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module, a job later transferred to the Progress MS-17 vehicle. The station made one and a half complete rotations over the next 44 minutes, after which &quot;Nauka&quot; burned through its remaining fuel and Mission Control Moscow disabled the engines. &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s control system was transferred from flight mode to &quot;docked with the ISS&quot; mode, and thrust control was returned to Progress MS-17 and &quot;Zvezda&quot;, allowing attitude control of the station to be regained. Because of the glitch, all activities were temporarily scrubbed and the launch of Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2 was delayed 96 hours while the crew continued checkouts of &quot;Nauka&quot;. On 3 August 2021, it was decided to use &quot;Zvezda&quot;″s engines to correct the station&#x27;s orbit parameters for the relocation of Soyuz MS-18 and the launch of Soyuz MS-19. The burn was originally planned for 19 August, but was instead executed on 21 August and lasted for 50 seconds.

Because of the incident, Mission Control Moscow ordered &quot;Zvezda&quot; to be evacuated while commands were sent to purge the fuel lines with helium and to make sure there were no leaks of the toxic hypergolic fuel on the Russian Segment.

=== Commission ===
The international partners formed a commission chaired by Bill Nelson of NASA. Members of this panel included prime contractor Boeing, JAXA and their prime contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ESA and their prime contractors Thales Alenia Space and Dutch Space, Roscosmos, and contractors from Energia. On 30 July the commission delivered their final report and the chief engineer identified the root cause of the glitch to be a direct command sent to &quot;Nauka&quot; from the ground before the Kurs and TORU systems were deactivated, leading to the thruster firings.

=== Integrating into the ISS ===
Work resumed on 30 July 2021 to outfit &quot;Nauka&quot; and tie its computers into the ISS. Novitsky and Dubrov performed leak checks before they started opening hatches between the modules. Once the hatch was opened, cables were connected and laptops were set up and connected to the station&#x27;s routers. Then the cosmonauts connected the plumbing and the waste and fuel lines to the station, and disabled &quot;Nauka&quot;″s engines to prevent them from firing until they were connected to the station&#x27;s computers. They also set up sleeping quarters for the crew that were to arrive shortly, activated experiments and turned on environmental control to cool &quot;Nauka&quot; until the RTOd radiator was extracted from &quot;Rassvet&quot; in October. At 17:47 UTC, the hatches were opened and Novitsky and Dubrov entered &quot;Nauka&quot; and made their way into the workshop. They first installed ventilation lines from the U.S. and Russian segments to vent out any stale air remaining from the launch. Next, they activated alarms and smoke detectors and installed gas monitors to check for traces of UDMH and N2O4 following venting the day before. They finished the day by removing unneeded hardware and launch restraints and transferring them to Progress MS-17 for disposal.

On 2 August 2021, Novitsky and Dubrov dismantled some hardware that came up in &quot;Nauka&quot; and disposed of unneeded trash. They also started installing racks and assembling the station&#x27;s toilet, and assembled the environmental control systems. They finished the day by cleaning their spacesuits and doing maintenance on the suits&#x27; environmental systems in preparation for an upcoming spacewalk. Over the next few days, they unloaded all the cargo and emptied the corridor so the cosmonauts could gain access to the nadir end.

On 9 and 12 September 2021, two spacewalks were performed by Novitsky and Dubrov to wire up &quot;Nauka.&quot; The cosmonauts also installed handrails and attachment points for experiments. Work was done inside to install the Robotic Work Station which controls ERA. On 28 September 2021, Soyuz MS-18 was moved around the block to &quot;Nauka&quot; for the first docking of these two spacecraft. This cleared &quot;Rassvet&quot; for the arrival of Soyuz MS-19 on 5 October 2021.

On 15 October 2021, at 09:02 UTC, during preparation of the ship&#x27;s propulsion system for landing, the Soyuz MS-18 inadvertently fired its thrusters beyond its planned time, changing the orientation of the ISS by as much as 57°, at 09:13 UTC. The station&#x27;s attitude control system counteracted that motion by activating thrusters of the Russian Segment. The erroneous firing of Soyuz engines was the result of a procedural error in the instructions sent by mission control to Novitsky ahead of the test. Fortunately, the flight control system aboard the Soyuz spacecraft had a limit set for the engine testing, which generated a cutoff command as soon as the firing consumed all the propellant allocated for the test. As a result, all the propellant reserves aboard the spacecraft needed for landing remained untouched. The crew was not in danger and it was the second such incident since the loss of control of the &quot;Nauka&quot; on 29 July.

On 17 October 2021, Soyuz MS-18 undocked from &quot;Nauka&quot;, returning Novitsky and two space tourists, actress Yulia Peresild and her producer director Klim Shipenko, to Earth, after spending a week on the station filming the movie &quot;The Challenge&quot;.

On 20 October 2021, Progress MS-17 undocked from &quot;Poisk&quot; and was placed in chase mode for 24 hours.The Progress MS-17 was the cargo freighter that assisted the crew in many of operations related to Nauka, including providing equipment for integrating Nauka. It redocked to &quot;Nauka&quot; on 22 October. After the redocking Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov installed a docking adapter and reopened the hatches to finish loading it with trash from inside &quot;Nauka,&quot; in preparation for its undocking on 24 November.

=== Integrating with &quot;Prichal&quot; ===

Roscosmos launched the &quot;Prichal&quot; Node Module in November 2021. &quot;Prichal&quot;, expected to outlive the ISS together with &quot;Nauka&quot; as part of the planned Russian Orbital Service Station, will increase the number of available docking ports on the Russian Orbital Segment by four. As &quot;Nauka&quot; was designed to be permanently docked to &quot;Prichal&quot;, its nadir docking port is of the SSVP-M or &quot;Hybrid&quot; standard, which consists of the traditional SSVP-G probe‑and‑drogue soft-dock mechanism and an APAS-95 hard-dock collar. This would make the docking port unusable for Soyuz or Progress flights in case &quot;Prichal&quot; failed to arrive at the station, because these spacecraft use a slightly different SSVP standard. To ensure the availability of four ports on the segment, &quot;Nauka&quot; was launched with an APAS to SSVP-G adapter ring.

On 25 November 2021, Progress MS-17 undocked from &quot;Nauka&quot;, taking with it the adapter ring, since &quot;Prichal&quot; can dock only to a SSVP-M port, not SSVP-G. It was later deorbited together with Progress MS-17 and both burned up on reentry over the South Pacific Ocean. After this, the final visiting spacecraft, Progress M-UM, a modified Progress spacecraft consisting of the usual fuel compartment and propulsion module and &quot;Prichal&quot; in place of the forward pressurized module, docked to the now exposed SSVP-M port. On 22 December 2021, the Progress undocked from &quot;Prichal&quot;, freeing the nadir port for docking. A spacewalk on 19 January 2022, connected power and telemetry cables and fluid quick disconnects were mated so Progress and Soyuz ships can transfer fuel to &quot;Nauka&quot;″s main tanks.

== Outfitting work ==
Twelve spacewalks were required to fully outfit alongside commissioning &quot;Nauka&quot; and &quot;ERA&quot;; the first of these was performed in September 2021, ending in August 2023.
===Bringing ERA to functionality===

=== Installation of outfitting equipment ===

In May 2010, outfitting equipment for &quot;Nauka&quot; was launched, attached to the outside of &quot;Rassvet&quot; (Mini-Research Module 1) on STS-132 (as part of an agreement with NASA) and delivered by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The equipment, weighing 1.4 metric tons, includes a spare elbow joint for ERA (launched with &quot;Nauka&quot;) and an ERA portable workpost used during EVAs, the RTOd heat radiator, internal hardware and an experiment airlock for launching CubeSats, to be positioned on the modified passive forward port near the nadir end of the module.

Out of these, the outfitting equipment needed for ERA was to be first deployed. After that, the radiator and airlock was outfitted to Nauka. The spacewalkers changed a grapple fixture so the airlock can be used as a base point for the arm, broke torque on bolts that secure the airlock and radiator to &quot;Rassvet&quot;, removed launch restraints from the radiator, and vented nitrogen jumpers on VKD-55 spacewalk on 17 November 2022. The airlock has a NASA-made FRGF grapple fixture, which was attached to the airlock component carried aboard &quot;Rassvet&quot;, and used to attach it to the shuttle&#x27;s Canadarm for passing it over to the station&#x27;s Canadarm2. The grapple fixture is designed to operate until 2028. The cosmonauts modified this grapple fixture to allow ERA to transfer the airlock from its storage location on &quot;Rassvet&quot; to the operational position on &quot;Nauka&quot;&#x27;s forward port and for airlock&#x27;s use all over the station.

The deployable radiator adds additional cooling capability to &quot;Nauka&quot;, enabling it to host more scientific experiments. The airlock is used only to pass experiments inside and outside &quot;Nauka&quot; with the aid of ERA — serving a very similar purpose to the Japanese airlock on &quot;Kibo&quot; and Nanoracks Bishop Airlock, both on the U.S. segment of the station.

The ERA was used to remove the RTOd radiator on VKD-56 spacewalk and experiment airlock Shk on VKD-57 spacewalk from &quot;Rassvet&quot; and transfer them over to &quot;Nauka&quot;. This process took several months. 

Another MLM outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads (Sredstva Krepleniya Krupnogabaritnykh Obyektov, SKKO). It was delivered in two parts to Nauka by Progress MS-18 (delivered LCCS part, that is, the four part SKKO frame) and Progress MS-21 (delivered SCCS part, that is, the payload adapter plates) spacecraft as a part of module activation outfitting process. Once the nadir end of SKKO was soft docked to Nauka and bolted down, the launch locks on SKKO were released by the spacewalkers to allow it to be unfolded and extended with its joints self locking in the extended position to create a rigid frame. Then the Zenith end of SKKO was soft docked to Nauka and bolted down. The 3 passive payload adapters and the one active payload adapter (i.e. active remote sensing payload like MIR Priroda&#x27;s Travers Synthetic Aperture Radar) are then outfitted. The SKKO is derived from the setup used on the Priroda module. SKKO elements were launched inside the Progress spacecraft and transferred to a temporary storage location inside one of the station modules. It was taken outside and installed on the ERA aft facing base point on Nauka during the VKD-55 spacewalk. Further follow on hardware is not part of the modules activation outfitting spacewalk series and are yet to be assigned a flight.

With the help of the SKKO system, located on the outer surface of the MLM-U, 5 universal workstations URM-N will appear, each of which is equipped with three payload adapters, due to which the total number of places for accommodating scientific equipment will be 16 pieces. The total weight of the equipment installed at the SKKO is less than .

The portable work platform on Rassvet was also transferred over as the last MLM-outfitting in August 2023 during VKD-60 spacewalk, which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to &quot;ride&quot; on the end of the arm during spacewalks. This completed the Nauka and ERA outfitting tasks.
===RTOd heat radiator damaged===
However, even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation, six months later, the RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka (the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments). The malfunction, a leak, rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka. This is the third ISS radiator leak after Soyuz MS-22 and Progress MS-21 radiator leaks. If a spare RTOd is not available, Nauka experiments will have to rely on Nauka&#x27;s main launch radiator and the module could never be utilized to its full capacity.

<doc id="977418" wikidata="Q913314" url="?curid=977418" title="Santiago Metro">
<text>The Santiago Metro () is a rapid transit system serving the city of Santiago, the capital of Chile. It currently consists of seven lines (numbered 1-6 and 4A), 143 stations, and of revenue route. The system is managed by the state-owned Metro S.A. and is the first rapid transit system in the country.

The Santiago Metro carries around 2.5 million passengers daily. This figure represents an increase of more than a million passengers per day compared to 2007, when the ambitious Transantiago project was launched, in which the metro plays an important role in the public transport system serving the city. Its highest passenger peak was reached on 2 May 2019, reaching 2,951,962 passengers.

In June 2017 the government announced plans for the construction of Line 7, connecting Renca in the northwest of Santiago with Vitacura in the northeast. The new line will add and 19 new stations to the Metro network, running along the municipalities of Renca, Cerro Navia, Quinta Normal, Santiago, Providencia, Las Condes and Vitacura. Its cost has been initially estimated at US$2.53 bn, and it is projected to open in 2027.

In March 2012, the Santiago Metro was chosen as the best underground system in the Americas, after being honoured at the annual reception held by &quot;Metro Rail&quot; in London.

== History and development ==
=== Early projections and construction of Line 1 ===

The idea of constructing an underground railway network in Santiago dates back to 1944 when efforts to improve the chaotic transport system were initiated due to the rapid population growth the city had been experiencing since the early 1930s.

However, concrete plans began to materialize in the 1960s when Juan Parrochia was appointed as Chief Architect of the Intercommunal Plan of Santiago and began working on an urban master plan featuring a Metro network.

Consequently, the government issued an international tender for the development of an urban transport system. On 24 October 1968, the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva approved the draft submitted by the Franco-Chilean consortium BCEOM SOFRETU CADE, in which the construction of five lines with an extension of approximately by 1990 was proposed.

On 29 May 1969, works finally began for the construction of the first line, which would link the Civil District and the area of Barrancas (current-day Lo Prado).

On 15 September 1975, the first line of the metro was opened by Augusto Pinochet during the military dictatorship. Line 1, during its opening stage, was mostly underground from San Pablo to La Moneda, running below the Alameda. In 1977, the line was extended towards Providencia and by 1980, the line reached as far as Escuela Militar in Las Condes.

In March 1978, Line 2 was opened. Its initial section ran at ground level from Los Héroes to Franklin. By December, the second segment of the line was opened, running underground towards the south along the Gran Avenida up to Lo Ovalle.

=== Project changes ===

Despite the fast growth of the network, the severe economic crisis that affected the country in 1982 halted the original plans. Furthermore, studies showed that southeast Santiago was becoming more populated than the north end of the capital, area that was then covered by the planned extensions of the service.

In order to supply future demand, the layout for Line 2 was changed and the extension would start at Los Héroes and go around the Civic District, crossing Line 1 again at Baquedano to head south through Vicuña Mackenna. Meanwhile, Line 3 was projected through Independencia and Irarrázaval to supply the northern area that Line 2 was supposed to run.

However, these plans were affected once again when an earthquake struck the Chilean Central Valley on 3 March 1985. Most of the funds destined for the construction of the Line 2 extension and Line 3 were used to rebuild the city. The opening of two new stations towards the north in 1986 (Santa Ana) and 1987 (Puente Cal y Canto) were the only finalised works from these plans: Santa Ana and Mapocho stations on Line 2. The latter would change its name later, as remains of the old Calicanto Bridge –emblem of the city for over a century– were discovered during the excavation process. That same year, the Metrobús service was launched with services operating from Escuela Militar, Lo Ovalle and Las Rejas.

Institutionally, the management of Metro de Santiago was changed at the end of the decade. The former General Directorate of Metro, a branch of the Ministry of Public Works, became a state-funded public company, Metro S.A., with the provisions of Law 18,772 published on 28 January 1989.

Following the economic recovery after the second miracle, the metro&#x27;s expansion plans resurged. Population growth in the southeastern area of the capital became unstoppable during the 1980s, and La Florida became the most populous commune in the country, thus the construction of a new line to supply that area was paramount. The first plans were drawn in 1989 and it was officially announced in 1991 by President Patricio Aylwin. This new line would start from Baquedano and head southwards to Américo Vespucio Avenue, crossing through Vicuña Mackenna.

Line 5 was opened on 5 April 1997 by President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. This new line would have a length of initially running underground from Baquedano to Irarrázaval, emerging as a viaduct on Vicuña Mackenna and going underground before reaching its southeastern terminus, Bellavista de la Florida.

In March 2000, a new section of Line 5 crossing the historic centre of the capital was opened to the public. The new connection between Baquedano and Santa Ana through Plaza de Armas and Bellas Artes meant that all three at-the-time existing lines would be connected.

=== New lines 4 and 4A and line 2 extension ===
With the election of Ricardo Lagos as President of Chile in 2000, one of his main objectives was an overhaul of the transport system serving the capital. To achieve this, a new extension for Line 5 was designed, heading westwards to Quinta Normal, following Catedral street, and an extension for Line 2 from both ends of the line to reach the northern and southern ends of the Américo Vespucio ring road.

Despite this, the biggest announcement was made in 2002 when Lagos disclosed the construction of a fourth line for the metro, serving the southeastern communes of Santiago to reach the heart of Puente Alto, which had taken over La Florida as the most populous commune of the country. With these new projects, the Metro network would double its extension by 2010, year in which the country would celebrate its bicentennial.

These new projects were designed to make Metro the key element of the new transport reform plan for the city, Transantiago. Along with the new extensions, exchange stations were designed to allow for a better interaction between the urban railways and other means of transport, mainly buses. The first exchange station would open in Quinta Normal after the Line 5 extension was finalised on 31 March 2004. However, the original plan to host a railway station would be discarded following the failure of the Melitrén construction.

On September 8, 2004, the Metro would make another breakthrough when the Mapocho river was crossed underground, with the opening of Patronato and Cerro Blanco stations on Line 2. On 22 December 2004, the southern extension of the same line opened its new stations, El Parrón and La Cisterna. A second stretch of Line 2 towards the north would open on 25 November 2005, and the last in the series of extensions opened on 22 December 2005, with a total cost of US$170 million and a 27-million passenger increase annually.

On November 30, 2005, the first underground leg of Line 4 from Tobalaba to Grecia, and the viaduct between Vicente Valdés and Plaza de Puente Alto opened to the public. The unfinished track from Grecia and Vicente Valdés was covered by a rail replacement bus service operated by Transantiago until March 2, 2006, when the remaining stations and track were finished. Line 4 at this time was the longest of the network, with an extension of and 22 stations serving Providencia, Las Condes, Ñuñoa, La Reina, Peñalolén, Macul, La Florida and Puente Alto. This new line also saw the introduction of new rolling stock, the AS-2002, manufactured by Alstom in Brazil, featuring more interior space than those running other lines. Finally, Line 4 would be complemented with the opening of a branch service on August 16, 2006, Line 4A, which connected Line 2 from La Cisterna with Line 4 at Vicuña Mackenna, running through the Américo Vespucio ring road.

=== Extensions to Las Condes and Maipú ===

On November 15, 2005, President Ricardo Lagos announced the extension of Line 1 to the east, from Escuela Militar to Los Dominicos station, in the commune of Las Condes. To achieve this, three new stations were built, adding 4 kilometers to the railway network, which were inaugurated on January 7, 2010, during the presidency of Michelle Bachelet.

Along with the extension to Las Condes, one of the most important projects of the service was announced: the extension of the metro to the west, connecting the communes of Maipú, Pudahuel, Lo Prado and Quinta Normal to the Metro Network. In this way, the Metro approached the western sector of the city for the first time, reaching Maipú, the most populated commune in the country after surpassing Puente Alto in 2008.

On October 31, 2009, the final layout of the extension of Line 5 was approved, starting from the Quinta Normal station along Avenida San Pablo underground, turning south to come to the surface and travel along Avenida Teniente Cruz and later Avenida Pajaritos before becoming underground again and reaching the terminal station, in the Plaza de Armas of Maipú. The first section to the Pudahuel station was delivered on January 12, 2010, while the remaining section Until Maipú was opened to the public on February 3, 2011.

Along with the construction of the new extensions, important works were carried out that allowed the Pajaritos station on Line 1 to be renovated to convert it into the terminal of a loop, allowing greater efficiency to the most loaded section of said line and the postponed San José de la Estrella station was inaugurated on Line 4. The Del Sol station was also built in the extension to Maipú, which serves as a transfer to intercity buses.

In March 2012, the Santiago Metro was chosen as the best metro system in America, a distinction received at the annual Metro Rail dinner held in London, United Kingdom.

=== Line 2 and 3 extensions ===

On May 26, 2016, Metro announced the extension of Lines 2 and 3, adding 8.9 kilometers and 7 new stations to the Metro network. Both extensions are expected to begin operations during the second half of 2021. The extension of Line 2 to the south will add 5.1 kilometers and 4 new stations connecting the current terminal station in La Cisterna with San Bernardo locality. The new terminal station will be located next to a hospital called &quot;Hospital El Pino&quot; in San Bernardo. Meanwhile, the extension of Line 3 to the west will add 3.8 kilometers and 3 new stations to the Metro network, connecting future station Los Libertadores with Quilicura.

On November 2, 2017, Line 6 was inaugurated from Cerrillos to Los Leones adding 10 new stations. This new line does not have staffed ticket offices; instead there are automatic machines for ticket sales and loading money onto bip! cards. It has platform-edge doors to protect passengers, and traction power is supplied by overhead line equipment, not by conductor rails as on the other lines. It has new entrance and exit turnstiles at stations. The trains on Line 6 only have steel wheels, and are driverless.

On January 22, 2019, Line 3 was inaugurated, after 9 years of prospecting and construction and being delayed since the 1980s after the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake and the changing demographics of the city during the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. Its rolling stock material is identical to the Line 6 and were built simultaneously, so they&#x27;re considered &quot;twin lines&quot;.

On September 25, 2023, Line 3 was extended 3.8 km west from its northern terminus to Plaza Quilicura.
On November 27, 2023, Line 2 was extended 5.2 km south from its southern terminus to Hospital El Pino.

=== 2019 protests ===

During the month of October 2019, the Santiago metro network was affected by social protests due to the increase in the fare of the entire Metropolitan Mobility Network. Initially, secondary students staged massive acts of evasion between 6 and 11 October. The protests quickly escalated to several metro stations, resulting in train service being repeatedly interrupted.

On Friday the 18th, the situation escalated and the entire network had to be closed due to attacks on stations and workers. At night, after the declaration of a state of emergency by President Sebastián Piñera, several stations of the Metro were destroyed and burned, some of which were attacked again the next day, even though a curfew had been established. Meanwhile, the Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos investigated accusations that the Baquedano station was used as a detention and torture center by police and military. On the morning of the same day, the site was reviewed by staff from the INDH, PDI and guarantee judges. The judges found no evidence of torture or illegal detentions at the site, but an investigation was launched to rule out any irregular situation. However, investigations conducted by the National Institute of Human Rights and the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office found no evidence in this regard; in 2020, the allegations were dismissed, and the case was closed.

The Metro network had been partially reactivated as of Monday, October 21; however, due to the damage of some stations, the network will only be available in its entirety within a period of up to 7 months. Damage costs are estimated at more than $300 million. Metro de Santiago indicated that it does not have insurance contracted for the infrastructure of the stations and trains. Lines 3 and 6, meanwhile, opened on 23 October, Lines 2 and 5 on the 25th, Line 4 on the 28th, and line 4A on November 25, in all cases partially and on a shortened schedule.

On October 23, it was reported that 79 stations had been damaged in all, with lines 4, 4A, and 5 having the highest number of stations destroyed or vandalized. There were also damage to 6 trains, 5 on line 4 and one on line 1 - the latter set on fire at the San Pablo station. Upon the reopening of the last two stations (Trinidad and Protectora de la Infancia) on September 25, 2020, the metro system was back to 100% operation.

=== Lines 7, 8 and 9 ===

On June 1, 2017, President Michelle Bachelet announced in her last public account the construction of Metro Line 7. The plan initially included 21 stations along a 25 km extension, between the commune of Renca in the northwestern sector, and Vitacura in the northeastern sector. The route, estimated to open around 2027, was designed with a line parallel to the Mapocho River and Line 1 in mind, which would allow it to be decongested by approximately 10 000 daily passengers. Line 7 would allow the incorporation of the communes of Renca, Cerro Navia and Vitacura into the Network, also connecting popular neighborhoods with part of the financial and commercial district of the city.

At the end of 2017, the newspaper El Mercurio published a report that indicated that the route of the line was modified, so that in the Providencia sector it would not circulate under Andrés Bello Avenue (as originally thought), but would go parallel to Line 1 along Providencia Avenue, eliminating the combination in Salvador and moving it to Pedro de Valdivia. In addition, Metro announced that it would extend Line 6 to Isidora Goyenechea of the future Line 7.

One year after the announcement of Line 7, President Sebastián Piñera announced in his 2018 annual account that studies would begin for the construction of two new metro lines in a north–south direction: Line 8, which will connect the communes of La Florida and Puente Alto with Providencia, while Line 9 would reach from the center to the commune of La Pintana, one of the last in the city to receive the Metro. In addition, he announced that Line 4 would be extended by three stations in the southern sector to reach Bajos de Mena in Puente Alto. It was projected at that time that lines 8 and 9 would be inaugurated in 2028.

The impact of the social outbreak of 2019 delayed the planning work for the extension of the three lines, being resumed in September 2021, so it is estimated that lines 7, 8 and 9 would be inaugurated from 2030. In August 2023, a modification to the layout of Line 9 was announced, expanding it in the north to the Puente Cal y Canto station — which will become the first station with four concurrent lines — and in the south to Plaza de Puente Alto, combining with Line 4 and absorbing the proposed extension to Bajos de Mena.

=== Future plans ===
Various proposals have been presented to expand the Santiago Metro once lines 7, 8 and 9 are built.

Two communes in Greater Santiago will not have a direct connection to the Metro Network: Lo Espejo and Lo Barnechea, while other three only have in theirs limits; San Bernardo, Peñalolén and Huechuraba. In the case of Lo Espejo, the municipality has proposed expanding Line 4A through Américo Vespucio towards the west, in order to connect the commune to the network, while Lo Barnechea has expressed its interest in building two additional stations on Line 7 to reach La Dehesa. Meanwhile, the municipality of Maipú —one of the most populated in the city— launched a campaign to request the government to extend Line 6 to the western sector. Other proposals include reach the International Airport, for example, through a branch of Line 7.

During the inauguration of Line 3 in 2019, President Sebastián Piñera declared that Line 10 was going to be built. Although Metro indicated that a tenth line was not officially in its project portfolio, the government indicated that the initiative attempted to connect the Avenida Mapocho sector with Avenida Tobalaba, following the so-called &quot;central ring&quot; along Las Rejas, Suiza and Departamental avenues.

Other alternatives for new lines have been analyzed in the media in recent years and have been momentarily discarded; a line in the eastern sector through Tobalaba-Vespucio or Manquehue, another parallel to Line 1 through 5 de Abril-Blanco Encalada-Santa Isabel-Bilbao and Manquehue, and the northern section of &quot;Line 10&quot; through Dorsal, Lo Espinoza and Radal.

=== Timeline ===
== Rolling stock ==

The Santiago Metro currently operates 9 models of rolling stock: two models (the AS-2002 and the AS-2014) are steel-wheeled, while the others are all rubber-tyred. The NS 74 and NS 93 stock are based on the MP 73 and MP 89 stock of the Paris Metro respectively, while the NS-88 and NS-2007 stock are based on the FM-86 and NM-02 stock of the Mexico City Metro respectively. All rubber-tyred stock is preceded with the acronym NS (for &quot;Neumático Santiago&quot;); likewise, all steel-wheeled stock is preceded with the acronym AS (for &quot;Acero Santiago&quot;). The number representing each type of rubber-tyred and steel-wheeled rolling stock is the year of design of a particular rolling stock, not year of first use, similar to the practice in the Mexico City Metro and Paris Métro.

Currently, all the NS-2007 stock and a number of the NS-93 stock units are retrofitted with air conditioning, whereas the NS-2012, AS-2014 and NS-2016 were all built with air conditioning.

In September 2012, the NS 2012 trains went into service on Line 1. These trains are the first to be built with air conditioning.

On November 2, 2017, the line 6 entered revenue service. This line utilizes the AS-2014 (Acero Santiago 2014) which are the most modern stock of the system , being the first model in the system that are driverless. However, in the first and last car there is a control panel meant to control the train when necessary. It is also the first with security cameras, energy obtainment via overhead rigid catenary, and evacuation doors at the front of the first and last car (with an evacuation ramp for people on wheelchairs) as well as on the sides of each convoy. They are also the second to be built with air conditioning, and the third with LED lights. The line that they operate in is also the first in revenue service with platform safety barriers, followed by Line 3 opened in January 2019.

== Stations ==
In bold are transfer stations. In grey are stations projected or currently under construction.

== MetroArte ==
The Santiago Metro incorporates 73 public artworks in its stations through the MetroArte fundation. Universidad de Chile features &quot;Memoria visual de una nación&quot; (&quot;Visual Memory of a Nation&quot;), a 1,200 square-meters mural created by Chilean painter Mario Toral and represents the history of the country. Other pieces of art are in Baquedano (featuring modern art and a concert space), Bellas Artes (multimedia art), Santa Lucía (Portuguese azulejos, a gift made by the Lisbon Metro), La Moneda (with realistic painting representing typical landscape), and various other stations.

== Station amenities ==
A diverse array of services are provided within each Metro station. Ticket offices, public telephones and metro-network information panels exist in every station; &quot;Redbanc&quot;, &quot;Cirrus&quot; and &quot;Plus&quot;-enabled ATMs, typically provided by either the Banco de Chile company or the BancoEstado national bank, are common. Automatic recharge machines are also common, with all such machines charging a customer&#x27;s &quot;Bip!&quot; card with either cash deposits or a &quot;Redbanc&quot;-enabled card. In higher-traffic stations, there are screens that display MetroTV, featuring additional system information as well as music videos and short news segments.

Some 21 of the busiest stations contain a branch of Bibliometro, a system of lending libraries supported by the national Department of Libraries, Archives and Museums (Dibam). A Chilean ID or foreign passport allows any Metro customer to freely borrow from a reserve of books and other literature, but a registration is needed first.

Customers may rent a parking space for their bicycles through the &quot;Bicimetro&quot; network, which opened in 2008 at six stations and is slowly expanding, for a starting cost of $300 (approximately US$0.50) a day. There are weekly and monthly rental services too, that guarantee a fixed space for the bike (contrary to the daily rent which relies on random free-space).

Most underground Metro stations contain at least one shop or convenience store, with large line-transfer stations such as &quot;Baquedano&quot; featuring several food vendors and retailers, and even a small underground &quot;shopping center&quot; in &quot;Universidad de Chile&quot;.

=== Security and safety ===

Various private security agencies have day-to-day responsibility for maintaining order in the metro and deterring petty crime or attempts to board without paying. The largest transfer stations, such as Tobalaba, also feature depots of the Carabineros de Chile, the national military police force. Metro staff man the ticket counters in closed box offices and distribute tickets and money through small transaction windows.

Signage to advise customers of safety hazards is extensive, and each platform has a painted yellow line which customers are advised to not cross except to board a train. During rush hour, Metro staff line the platform edge to keep people from being crowded off the platform and to support disabled customers. There is no physical barrier between the edge and the tracks (with the exception of recently opened Lines 3 and 6), including the hazardous, electrified third rail. However, lines 3 and 6 use overhead lines as the powersource of the trains.

Metro travelers are advised to keep a close guard on their belongings, as petty or opportunistic theft is somewhat of a problem in lines that connect some districts to the center of Santiago. This is most apparent with passengers who reverse their backpacks so that the bag is across the stomach, to ensure that no one can pilfer the pockets out of sight.

== Pricing and working hours ==
Metro is part of Red Metropolitana de Movilidad, the integrated public transport system that serves the capital using also feeder and main bus routes. Red works with an integrated fare system, which allows passengers to make bus-bus or bus-metro transfers on a two-hour time limit from the first trip (maximum of two changes) using a contactless smart card called &quot;Bip! card&quot;. Bus-to-bus, metro-to-bus and metro-to-train transfers do not cost extra. Bus-to-metro transfers costs $20 (approx. US$0.03) during &quot;Horario Valle&quot; (low-use hours) and $80 (approx. US$0.12) during &quot;Horario Punta&quot; (rush hour).

Bip! cards are available in all the ticketing offices in every station at a cost of $1,550 (approx. US$2.23), with a minimum first charge of $1000 worth of credit (approx. US$1.41). Tickets are sold from 6:00 to 23:00 Monday to Friday, 6:30 to 23:00 on Saturdays, and 8:00 to 22:30 on Sundays and holidays. Cards can be topped up to $20000, and the credit only expires if the card it is not used in two years.

Metro also used to sell single-trip, Metro-use only tickets, but they went out of circulation in early 2017. Fares depended on the time of the use of the system. The cost of a ticket in the &quot;Horario Punta&quot; (rush hour, 7:00–8:59 and 18:00–19:59) was $700 (approx. US$1.01); in the &quot;Horario Valle&quot; (off-peak hours, 6:30–6:59, 9:00–18:00, 20:00–20:44, and all day on weekends and holidays) was $640 (approximately US$0.90); and in the &quot;Horario Bajo&quot; (low-use hours, 6:00–6:29 and 20:45–23:00) was $590 (approximately US$0.85).

Senior citizens (65 and older) and students holding concession cards pay $200 (US$0.28). Senior concession fare does not apply during rush hours.

On weekdays, the metro operates from 5.35 am until 12.08 am, while on Saturdays it operates from 6.30 am until 12.08 am and on Sundays and public holidays the metro operates from 8 am (Line 1 from 9 am) until 11.48 pm. However, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, operating hours have varied in accordance with national curfew.

<doc id="977421" wikidata="Q322106" url="?curid=977421" title="Walter William Skeat">
<text>Walter William Skeat, (21 November 18356 October 1912) was a British philologist and Anglican deacon. The pre-eminent British philologist of his time, he was instrumental in developing the English language as a higher education subject in the United Kingdom.

==Life==
Skeat was born in London to architect William Skeat, of Perry Hill, Sydenham, later of Mount Street, Park Lane, City of Westminster, and his wife Sarah, daughter of Timothy Bluck. The Skeat family were a branch of an ancient Surrey family, and were resident in the parish of St George Hanover Square since the 1700s. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School (Wimbledon), Highgate School, and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He became a fellow at Christ&#x27;s College in July 1860.

In 1860 Skeat was ordained an Anglican deacon and married Bertha Clara. In December 1860, he became a curate at East Dereham, where he served during 1861 and most of 1862. From 1862 to 1863, Skeat served as the curate at Godalming, Surrey. In October 1864, he returned to Cambridge University as a mathematics lecturer, a position he held until 1871.

Skeat soon developed an interest in the history of the English language. In 1870, Skeat and Henry Bradshaw collaborated on an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer for the University of Oxford. However, the project fell through when Bradshaw failed to keep his commitment. In 1894, Skeat published a six-volume edition of Chaucer; a supplementary volume, &quot;Chaucerian Pieces&quot;, was published in 1897.

In 1878 Skeat was elected the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge. He completed Mitchell Kemble&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Gospels&quot;, and did work both in Old English and the Gothic language. Skeat is best known for his work in Middle English, and for his standard editions of Chaucer and William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.

Skeat was the founder and only president of the English Dialect Society from 1873 to 1896. The society&#x27;s purpose was to collect materials for the publication of &quot;The English Dialect Dictionary&quot;. The society was dissolved in 1897.

Skeat is buried at the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.

Skeat&#x27;s wife, Bertha Clara, born 6 February 1840, died 15 July 1924, is buried with him, as is a daughter Bertha Marian Skeat who was a writer and headmistress. His son was the anthropologist Walter William Skeat. His grandsons include the noted palaeographer T. C. Skeat and the stained glass painter Francis Skeat.

==Work==

===Etymology, lexicography, and toponymic studies===

In pure philology, Skeat&#x27;s principal achievement was his &quot;An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (4 parts, 1879–1882; rev., and enlarged, 1910). While preparing the dictionary, he wrote hundreds of short articles on word origins for the London-based journal &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;.

Skeat also coined the term &quot;ghost word&quot; and was a leading expert in this subject. Skeat was also a pioneer of toponymy. His major publications in this field include:
*&quot;A Concise Dictionary of Middle English&quot; (1888), in conjunction with A. L. Mayhew
*&quot;A Glossary of Tudor and Stuart Words&quot; (1914) with A. L. Mayhew
*&quot;The place-names of Cambridgeshire&quot; (1901)
*&quot;Place-names of Huntingdonshire&quot; (1902)
*&quot;Place-names of Hertfordshire&quot; (1904)
*&quot;Place-names of Bedfordshire&quot; (1906)
*&quot;Place-names of Berkshire&quot; (1911)
*&quot;Place-names of Suffolk&quot; (1913)

===Editions===

*&quot;The Holy Gospels in Anglo-Saxon, Northumbrian, and Old Mercian Versions&quot; (1871)
* Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; (1872) 
* &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; in three parallel texts (1886) 
* &quot;The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; (1894–97)

Skeat edited works for the Early English Text Society:
*&quot;Bruce&quot; of John Barbour 
*&quot;Pierce the Ploughman&#x27;s Crede&quot; 
*&quot;Havelok the Dane&quot;
*&quot;William of Palerne&quot;

For the Scottish Text Society:
*Skeat edited &quot;The Kingis Quair&quot;, 
*Skeat published an edition (2 vols., 1871) of Chatterton, with an investigation of the sources of the obsolete words used by Chatterton. 
*Skeat published an edition of Chaucer in one volume for general readers
*Skeat published an edition of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;, with an expert commentary.

Skeat produced what is still the main edition of Ælfric of Eynsham&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot;; the edition includes translations which were largely the work of two women referred to as Mss Gunning and Wilkinson, who were credited in the preface to his edition.

===Teaching===

According to A. J. Wyatt, Skeat &quot;was not a great teacher ... he left the teaching to those who had learned from him&quot; – i.e. Wyatt himself and Israel Gollancz – &quot;his teaching was episodic. Yet his lectures were eagerly followed by the fit though few; they were always interesting when least utilitarian, when he forgot examinations and syllabuses, and poured forth from the quaint storehouse of his motley memory things new and old.&quot;

Skeat&#x27;s pedagogical works include:

*&quot;Specimens of English from 1394 to 1597&quot; (1871)
*&quot;Specimens of Early English from 1298 to 1393&quot; (1872), in conjunction with Richard Morris
*&quot;Principles of English Etymology&quot; (2 series, 1887 and 1891)
*&quot;A Student&#x27;s Pastime&quot; (1896), a volume of essays
*&quot;The Chaucer Canon&quot; (1900)
*&quot;A Primer of Classical and English Philology&quot; (1905)

==International relations==
Skeat was one of the very few scholars in English studies who had sufficient expertise to compete with the state-employed and tenured colleagues from German universities.

Like Henry Sweet, Skeat regarded Geoffrey Chaucer and other medieval English authors as part of his national heritage and objected to German scholars publishing works on them. At one point, Skeat exclaimed that even though he was &quot;...to some extent disqualified, as being merely a native of London, in which city Chaucer himself was born,&quot; he should be able to contribute scholarship on Chaucer without perceived German interference.

<text>Richard Morris (8 September 1833 – 12 May 1894), was an English philologist and priest of the Church of England.

==Early life and career==
Morris was born at Bermondsey on 8 September 1833, of Welsh parentage. He was trained as an elementary schoolmaster at St John&#x27;s College, Battersea, but his education was for the most part self-acquired. In 1869, he was appointed Winchester lecturer on English language and literature in King&#x27;s College School.
In 1871, he was ordained, and served for two years as curate of Christ Church, Camberwell. From 1875 to 1888 he served as headmaster of the Royal Masonic School for Boys at Wood Green, and afterwards for a short time master of the grammar school of Dedham, Essex. His diploma of LL.D. was a Lambeth degree, conferred in 1870 by Archbishop Tait.

==Scholarship and publications==
As early as 1857, Morris showed the bent of his mind by publishing a little book on &quot;The Etymology of Local Names&quot;. He was one of the first to join as an active member the Chaucer, Early English, and Philological societies, founded by his lifelong friend, Dr F. J. Furnivall. None of his colleagues surpassed him in the devotion which he expended upon editing the oldest remains of our national literature from the original manuscript sources, on the same scientific principles as adopted by classical scholars. Between 1862 and 1880, he brought out no fewer than twelve volumes for the Early English Text Society, including three series of &quot;Homilies&quot; (1868 onwards) and two of &quot;Alliterative Poems&quot; (1864). In 1866, he edited Chaucer for the &quot;Aldine Poets&quot; (2nd ed. 1891). This was the first edition to be based upon manuscripts since that of Thomas Tyrwhitt, and remained the standard one until it was superseded by W. W. Skeat&#x27;s edition of 1894–7. In 1869, he edited Edmund Spenser for Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Globe&quot; edition, again using manuscripts as well as the original editions. In 1867, he published &quot;Specimens of Early English&quot; for the Clarendon Press, Oxford, which was augmented by Skeat in later editions.

Morris&#x27;s long experience as a schoolmaster also prompted him to undertake a series of successful educational works. The first was &quot;Historical Outlines of English Accidence&quot; (1872), which went through some twenty editions, before being thoroughly revised after the author&#x27;s death by Henry Bradley and Leon Kellner. In 1874 he brought out &quot;Elementary Lessons in Historical English Grammar&quot;; and in the same year a primer of &quot;English Grammar&quot;.
Scarcely had he struck out on this remunerative line of authorship than he turned aside to devote the remainder of his life to the study of Pāli, the sacred language of Buddhism. The stimulus came from his friendship with Professor Thomas Rhys Davids, founder of the Pāli Text Society. For the PTS he edited four texts between 1882 and 1888, more than any other contributor up to that point. But he did not confine himself to editing: his familiarity with the development of early English caused him to take a special interest in the corresponding position of Pāli, as standing midway between the ancient Sanskrit and the modern vernaculars, and as branching out into various dialects known as Prakrits. These relations of Pāli he expounded in a series of letters to the &quot;Academy&quot;, which were valuable not only for their lexicographical facts, but also as illustrating the historical growth of the languages of India. The last work he was able to complete was a paper on this subject, read before the International Congress of Orientalists in London in September 1892. He was not personably able to correct the proofs of this paper for publication in the &quot;Transactions&quot;.

==Death==
For the last two years of his life Morris was prostrated by an incurable and distressing illness, which he bore with fortitude, preserving his cheerfulness and his love of a good story to the last. He retired to the railway-side hamlet of Harold Wood, Essex, where he died on 12 May 1894. He was buried at Hornchurch.

==Recognition and legacy==
*The University of Oxford conferred awarded Morris the honorary degree of M.A. on 28 May 1874.
*In 1893, William Gladstone granted him an annual pension of £150 on the civil list; and following his death, on 2 June 1896, new pensions of £25 each were created in favour of his three daughters.
*The greater part of his valuable philological library was acquired by the bookseller, David Nutt.

<doc id="977433" wikidata="Q17118732" url="?curid=977433" title="Ip dip">
<text>Ip dip is a rhythmic counting-out game with many variations, the purpose of which is to select an individual from a group, for instance to choose the starting player of a game. It has been commonly used in British playgrounds for many years. It also exists as &quot;dip, dip, dog shit&quot; in Australia.

The speaker of the rhyme points to a different person in order as each stressed syllable is spoken; the person pointed to as the final syllable is spoken is thereby elected.

The aim is to delay and distract from counting the syllables or otherwise fixing the result; the rhyme should be so long that the speaker loses count and cannot predict the chosen person. Perhaps this unpredictability is the reason that there are so many variations, including the practice of stringing variations together — which may be considered cheating.

== Examples ==

=== Australia ===
A common Australian version goes:

:Dip, dip, dog shit /
:Who trod in it? /
:What colour was it? /
:Who saw it? /
:(Say the name of a colour) /
:(Spell the name of that colour) /
:You are not it.

A variation of this version was featured on &quot;Bluey&quot;:

:Ip dip sky blue /
:Who&#x27;s it not you! /
:Not because you&#x27;re dirty, /
:Not because you&#x27;re clean. /
:My mum says you&#x27;re the fairy queen! /

:Ip dip doo, /
:The cat&#x27;s got the flu, /
:The dog&#x27;s got the chickenpox, /
:So out goes you.

:Ip dip doo /
:Doggy did a poo /
:Went to the cinema at half-past two /
:When the film started /
:Everybody farted /
:Out goes you.

=== United Kingdom ===
A Welsh version of the rhyme runs:

:Ip dip dip /
:My blue [or little] ship /
:Sailing on the water /
:Like a cup and saucer, /
:But you are not in &quot;it&quot;.

Another version, from Northern Ireland, runs:

:Ip dip sky blue, /
:Granny sitting on the loo, /
:Doing farts, playing darts, /
:Out goes you! /
:O-U-T spells Out!

=== Elsewhere ===
Other recorded versions include:

:Ip dip sky blue /
:Who&#x27;s it, not you!

A version from World War One was recorded by Thomas Ringlestone:

:Ip dip doo /
:The cat&#x27;s got the flu /
:The cat&#x27;s got the plague /
:I choose you!

Another version runs:

:Ip dip dog shit /
:Fucking bastard silly git /
:You are not it /
:You tit.

A version from Switzerland goes:

:Ip dip doo /
:Doggy did a poo /
:Cat did a you know what /
:Out goes you.

<text>The is the third largest of Japan&#x27;s yakuza groups, with approximately 1,700 members. It is based in the Kantō region, and was one of the first yakuza organizations to begin operating overseas.

==History==
The Inagawa-kai was founded in Atami, Shizuoka in 1949 as the by Kakuji Inagawa. Most of its members were drawn from the bakuto (traditional gamblers), and illegal gambling has long been the clan&#x27;s main source of income. It has also expanded into such fields as drug trafficking, blackmail, extortion, and prostitution.

The Inagawa-gumi was renamed the Inagawa-kai in 1972. After Kakuji Inagawa, the gang was led by Susumu Ishii, who led it to unprecedented financial prosperity during the 1980s Japanese bubble economy. At one point the clan&#x27;s assets were estimated to be over $1.5 billion. After Ishii&#x27;s death in 1990, Inagawa&#x27;s son Toi Inagawa took over as &quot;kumicho&quot; and led the clan until his death in May 2005. Yoshio Tsunoda took up the mantle in 2006, heading the clan until his death in February 2010. Kazuo Uchibori may be next in line to lead the clan, but his status as a kyodaibun (blood brother) to Takeuchi Teruaki, a senior member of the Yamaguchi-gumi, may complicate things.

February 2009 saw the Inagawa-kai &#x27;Honbu&#x27; (Head Office) relocate from the Roppongi district of Tokyo to Akasaka. There is currently strong resistance from the local political groups and residents of Akasaka meaning that the location of the new Honbu may change yet again.

The Inagawa-kai quietly helped to provide relief in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami by sending supplies to affected areas. As a whole, the group shipped over 100 tons of supplies, including instant ramen, bean sprouts, paper diapers, batteries, flashlights, tea and drinking water, to the Tōhoku region.

==Key persons==
Inagawa-kai&#x27;s renowned figures in the 20th century include Tatsuo Deguchi (known as the &quot;Moroccan Tatsu&quot; or &quot;Tatsu of Morocco&quot;), Kingo Yoshimizu, Kijin Inoue, Takamasa Ishii, Haruki Sho, and Kiichiro Hayashi.

==Leadership==
On April 7, 2019, Jiro Kiyota retired from &quot;kaicho&quot; and assumed the position of &quot;sosai&quot;, but remains the leader according to the National Police Agency.

<text>Lidiya Pavlovna Skoblikova (; born 8 March 1939) is a retired Russian speed skater and coach. She represented the USSR Olympic team during the Winter Olympic Games in 1960, 1964 and 1968, and won a total of six gold medals, a record she shares with Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst. She also won 25 gold medals at the world championships and 15 gold medals at the USSR National Championships in several distances. She was also the first athlete to earn six gold medals in the Winter Olympics and the first to earn four gold medals at a single Olympic Winter Games. She was the most successful athlete at the 1960 and 1964 Winter Olympics, sharing the honour for 1960 Games with her compatriot Yevgeny Grishin.

==Career==
Skoblikova was born in Zlatoust, Soviet Union, some 160 km west of Chelyabinsk, Ural. She trained at Burevestnik and later at Lokomotiv sports societies. At age 19 in 1959, Skoblikova qualified for the Soviet team and placed third in the national championships. She repeated that performance at the world championships, winning two distance medals as well. The next season, she seemed headed for the world title after winning the 500 m and placing 2nd in the 1500 m, but she fell in the 1000 m. By winning the 3000 m, she managed to land on the podium anyway, placing third again. A favourite for the Olympics now, she entered three events. In the first race, the 1500 m, she broke the world record, and won the gold medal. After just missing a second medal in the 1000 m (fourth), Skoblikova approached the world record in the 3000 m (missing it by just half a second), but that was enough for her second gold medal. 

During the following years, Skoblikova fought with her teammates to become world champion. In 1961, she won the bronze for the third consecutive time, followed by the silver medal in 1962. In 1963, she finally won the title. In Karuizawa, conditions were excellent, and Skoblikova won all four races, setting a new 1000 m world record in the process. 

For the 1964 Olympics, Skoblikova qualified for all four distances, and she won all of them, thereby becoming the first Winter Olympian to win four individual gold medals. This record was only beaten by Eric Heiden who won all five speed skating events in 1980. Two weeks after the Olympics, she repeated her performance from Karuizawa and won all four distances at the world championships. 

Skoblikova withdrew from speed skating for two seasons, but returned in 1967, setting a new 3000 m world record in January. She failed to reach the podium at the world championships however, and placed fourth. In 1968, she skated her third and last Olympics, with the best achievement of 6th place in the 3000 m. During her career she won 15 national titles in various distances, but never the all-around championships.

After her retirement in 1969, Skoblikova moved to Moscow to work as a speed skating coach at Lokomotiv. In 1973, she began her studies at The Academy of Labor and Social Relations and received a degree in pedagogy in 1979. She later earned a PhD in history and became a professor. By 1983, she was a member of the Soviet National Olympic Committee, and received a silver Olympic Order from the hands of Juan Antonio Samaranch. For 12 years she was president of the Russian Skating Federation, and in the 1990s was the head coach of the Russian team. In 1996, she was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, and three years later received the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot; from the hands of Boris Yeltsin. On February 7, 2014, she was one of the six people who held the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

==Family==
Skoblikova was born in a working-class family and had three sisters and one brother. She married Aleksandr Polozkov, who was a competitive racewalker and a member of the national team. Aleksandr was a talented coach and trained his wife during some periods of her career. Their son Georgy (b. 14 March 1965) assisted Skoblikova as a coach of the national speed skating team in the 1990s. His first wife, Natalya Polozkova, was also a speed skater and competed at the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, whereas his second wife, Tanya, won four national titles.

<text>Zagorje ob Savi (; , &quot;Seger an der Sau&quot;) is a town in the Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Zagorje ob Savi. It is located in the valley of Medija Creek, a minor left tributary of the Sava River, east of the capital city Ljubljana, southwest of Celje, and west of Trbovlje. The area is part of the traditional region of Upper Carniola. The entire municipality is now included in the Central Sava Statistical Region. The town is home to about 7,000 people. It includes the hamlets of Toplice () and Podvine.

==Name==
Zagorje ob Savi was attested in written sources as &quot;Zagorie&quot; in 1296, &quot;Zagoͤr&quot; in 1311, &quot;Sager&quot; in 1362, &quot;Sagor&quot; in 1391, and &quot;Seger&quot; in 1419, among other spellings. The name of the settlement was changed from &quot;Zagorje&quot; to &quot;Zagorje ob Savi&quot; in 1955. In the early 20th century the German name was &quot;Sagor&quot;.

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows that the area was already settled in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. In 1755 deposits of coal were discovered in the area and the town&#x27;s economic development began. Coal mining was one of the area&#x27;s main activities until 1995, when the last mines were closed. In 2010, Zagorje ob Savi was heavily affected by floods.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It is a Neo-Romanesque church built in 1873.

<doc id="977446" wikidata="Q1554207" url="?curid=977446" title="Gulab jamun">
<text>Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun; or &#x27;Rose berry&#x27;) is a sweet confectionery or dessert, originating in the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai popular in India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, Gulf states, the Malay Peninsula, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname). 

It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from &quot;khoya&quot;, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of &quot;khoya&quot;. It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as almonds and cashews, to enhance flavour.

== Preparation ==
In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as &quot;khoya&quot;, remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature, then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron. Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or kulfi.

==Origins==
According to culinary historian Michael Krondl, 12th century Manasollasa mentions a recipe for fried fritter balls made of &quot;chenna&quot; cheese and rice flour and was soaked in cardamom-scented syrup, but this recipe did not use rosewater (gulab) syrup. The 13th century Arab dessert &quot;luqmat al-qadi&quot; is similar in appearance to gulab jamun, although it is made of entirely different batter than gulab jamun but was soaked in rosewater-scented (gulab) syrup, the only Persian connection may be the common use of rosewater syrup. Gulab Jamun emerged in medieval India during the Mughal Empire, blending Persianate influence with local influences that eventually became gulab jamun. The word &quot;gulab&quot; is derived from the Persian words &quot;gul&quot; (flower) and &quot;āb&quot; (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup, and &quot;Jamun&quot; or &quot;jaman&quot; is the Hindi word for &quot;Syzygium jambolanum&quot;, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum. Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup.

== Special occasions ==
&quot;Gulab jamun&quot; is often eaten at festivals, birthdays or major celebrations such as marriages, the Muslim celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi. There are various types of &quot;gulab jamun&quot;.

==Variants==

===India===

&quot;Gulab jamun&quot; gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (&quot;khoya&quot;). In other types of &quot;gulab jamun&quot;, sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called &quot;kala jamun&quot; or &quot;black jamun&quot;. The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a &quot;gulab jamun&quot;.

Homemade &quot;gulab jamun&quot; is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup.

In Bengali, Gulab Jamun is known as Kalo Jam or Pantua, which is similar to &quot;gulab jamun&quot;, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish. Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of &quot;gulab jamun&quot;. It is said to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856–62.

Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for &quot;Jhurre Ka Rasgulla&quot;, which has been made there for the past 100 years. It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.

In Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi.

In Western Madhya Pradesh and Malwa, Mawa Bati is popular as local version of Gulab Jamun.

It is different from Gulab jamun by size, fillings and amount of sweetness, Mawa bati is usually not immersed in Sugar syrup and slightly larger than Gulab Jamun.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, Pantua is available almost everywhere throughout the country, which can be referred to a Bengali variation of Gulab jamun. Also there are two kinds of jamuns that are famous. They are Golap Jam () and Kalo Jam ().

=== Nepal ===
The sweet is known as Lal Mohan () in Nepali language and is available at almost every sweet shop. The sale of the sweet usually increases significantly during festivals such as Tihar, Dashain, etc.

<text>John Mitchell Kemble (2 April 1807 – 26 March 1857), English scholar and historian, was the eldest son of Charles Kemble the actor and Maria Theresa Kemble. He is known for his major contribution to the history of the Anglo-Saxons and philology of the Old English language, including one of the first translations of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

== Education ==
Kemble received his education from Charles Richardson and at Bury St Edmunds grammar school, where he obtained in 1826 an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles. As a law student, his historical essays were well received but he &quot;would not follow the course of study prescribed by the university and was, moreover, fond of society and of athletic amusements&quot;, which caused the deferral of his graduation in 1829. His Bachelor of Arts degree was granted in March 1830, and his M.A. degree three years later in March 1833.

== Anglo-Saxon studies ==
Kemble concentrated on Anglo-Saxon England, through the influence of Jacob Grimm, under whom he studied at Göttingen (1831). He published &quot;Anglo-Saxon Poems of Beowulf&quot; (1833–1837), &quot;Über die Stammtafeln der Westsachsen&quot; (Munich 1836), &quot;Codex diplomaticus aevi Saxonici&quot; (London 1839–1848), and made many contributions to reviews; his &quot;History of the Saxons in England&quot; (1849; new ed. 1876) was based on original sources for the early period of English history.

Kemble&#x27;s &quot;literal&quot; &quot;Beowulf&quot; translation was entirely in prose.

He was editor of the &quot;British and Foreign Review&quot; from 1835 to 1844; and from 1840 to his death was Examiner of Plays. In 1857 he published &quot;State Papers and Correspondence Illustrative of the Social and Political State of Europe from the Revolution to the Accession of the House of Hanover&quot;.

His &quot;Horae Ferales, or Studies in the Archaeology of Northern Nations&quot; was completed by Robert Gordon Latham, and published in 1864.

== Marriage and death ==
Kemble married Nathalie Auguste, daughter of Amadeus Wendt of the University of Göttingen, in about 1836. They had two daughters and a son, but the marriage was not a happy one and they were living apart by about 1850. The elder daughter, Gertrude (b. 1837) married Sir Charles Santley, the singer, and died in 1882.

Kemble died at Dublin on 26 March 1857 and is buried there in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

<doc id="977451" wikidata="Q2349753" url="?curid=977451" title="Sumiyoshi-kai">
<text>The , sometimes referred to as the , is the second-largest yakuza group in Japan with an estimated 2,200 members.

== Outline ==
Their territories mainly consist of upscale districts such as Kabukichō and Ginza. Shops operating in these territories are often part of protection rackets in which they must pay a fee called a .
The Sumiyoshi-kai is a confederation of smaller gangs. Structurally, the Sumiyoshi-kai differs from its main rival, the Yamaguchi-gumi. The Sumiyoshi-kai, as a federation, has a looser chain of command and while there is a chairman, some power is delegated to affiliate clan leaders.

The group has a complex history, with numerous name changes along the way. It was founded in 1958 as the Minato-kai (港会) by Shigesaku Abe who was the 3rd of the Sumiyoshi-ikka. Yoshimitsu Sekigami, who was the 4th &quot;sōchō&quot; of Sumiyoshi-ikka, renamed it to Sumiyoshi-kai. It was dissolved in 1965.

In 1969, the group was rebuilt as a union, the Sumiyoshi-rengo, by Masao Hori, who was the 5th &quot;sōchō&quot; of Sumiyoshi-ikka. He remade it as the Sumiyoshi-rengokai (住吉連合会) in 1982, and Hori became &quot;kaicho&quot; (president). Chief Director Ryoji Kawaguchi assumed the role of &quot;kaicho&quot;, and Hori was promoted to &quot;sosai&quot;, or chairman, in 1988. Kawaguchi died of illness in May 1990, and Hori died of illness in October of the same year.

Shigeo Nishiguchi, born in 1929, became the 6th &quot;sōchō&quot; of Sumiyoshi-ikka and &quot;kaicho&quot; of this group in February, 1991. At that time, it was again renamed the Sumiyoshi-kai. Chief Director Hareaki Fukuda, born in 1943, became &quot;kaicho&quot;, and Nishiguchi was promoted to &quot;sosai&quot; in June 1998. Fukuda became the 7th &quot;sōchō&quot; of the Sumiyoshi-ikka on April 17, 2005. 

On 19 April 2003, Takao Nishida, head of the affiliated Nishida-gumi, was gunned down in Ōizumi, Gunma. Police stated that they were probing for possible links between the murder and a series of shootings between the Sumiyoshi-kai and the Yamaguchi-gumi in neighboring Tochigi Prefecture.

On the morning of Monday, 5 January 2007, boss Ryoichi Sugiura was shot in his car in Tokyo. Within hours the offices of the Yamaguchi-gumi were fired upon in retribution. The following month, 70-year-old Kazuyoshi Kudo, head of the Kokusui-kai, was discovered in his home in Tokyo, police said. A gun was found by his side, suspected to be a suicide, raising tensions between the Sumiyoshi-kai and the Yamaguchi-gumi.

In September of 2017, Sumiyoshi-kai &quot;sosai&quot;, or chairman, Shigeo Nishiguchi died of natural causes at the age of 88.

In April 2020, a report from the National Police Agency shows that the total number of members of organized crime gangs fell to historical lows, having just 2,800 members and 1,700 associated members.

On May 31, 2022, Isao Seki, the eighth leader of the Sumiyoshi-kai, died at the age of 76. Shūji Ogawa, who holds the position of &quot;kaicho&quot;, is the leader of the Sumiyoshi-kai at the time of Isao Seki&#x27;s funeral.

<doc id="977453" wikidata="Q5252382" url="?curid=977453" title="Dehydratase">
<text>Dehydratases are a group of lyase enzymes that form double and triple bonds in a substrate through the removal of water. They can be found in many places including the mitochondria, peroxisome and cytosol. There are more than 150 different dehydratase enzymes that are classified into four groups. Dehydratases can act on hydroxyacyl-CoA with or without cofactors, and some have a metal and non-metal cluster act as their active site.

== Pathology ==
A dehydratase deficiency in the body can lead to a less severe condition of hyperphenylalaninemia, which involves an over presence of phenylalanine in the blood. It is caused by a genetic recessive disorder in the autosomal DNA.

== Examples ==
Common dehydratases include:

* Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ADA-D) is found in blood and is involved in the production of the heme group of globins. People exposed to lead will have a decrease in ADA-D activity.
* Serine dehydratase is mostly found in the liver and catalyzes the reaction of turning serine into pyruvate and ammonia. In a diet of increased protein, the activity of serine dehydratase is increased.
* Arogenate dehydratase is found mostly in the chloroplasts of higher plants. It catalyzes the reaction of turning -arogenate into -phenylalanine.

<text>Prevalje (; German: &quot;Prävali&quot;) is a town in northern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Prevalje. It lies in the traditional Slovenian province of Carinthia. Prevalje lies in a valley where the Meža River emerges from a narrow gorge, full of fluvioglacial sediments. To the north the town is bounded by the Strojna, Stražišče, and Dolga Brda hills. To the south are &quot;Navrski vrh&quot; () and &quot;Riflov vrh&quot; ().

==History==

The area around Prevalje was settled in prehistoric times, attested by archeological finds which include a bronze axe of the Hallstatt culture. In 1860, approximately 50 Roman marble slabs were found in the riverbed below today&#x27;s cellulose and cardboard factory at Paloma in Zagrad. The stones belonged to a large tomb on the Roman road from Celeia to Virunum. At the nearby Brančurnik Inn, a Roman sarcophagus known as the Brančurnik Bench () can be seen.

One of the last battles of the Second World War in Europe, the Battle of Poljana, was fought nearby on 14 and 15 May 1945 between the Yugoslav army and retreating Axis forces. In 2010, Slovenian officials discovered a mass grave containing the remains of approximately 700 men and women killed by units of KNOJ in 1945.

==Geography==
The historical center of Prevalje is on the left bank of the Meža, on the north edge of the valley, in the hamlet of Na Fari around the parish church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, known locally as Mary on the Lake (). It was originally a late Romanesque building, first mentioned in written documents dating to 1335, but the current church dates to 1890. A second historical centre lies around the confluence of Leše Creek () with the Meža. This is where the first industrial companies were established at the beginning of the 18th century, laying the foundations for rapid economic development of the area.

==Economy==
Prevalje was an important ironworking centre. The development of the town was closely connected the iron industry. Even today the processing industry forms an important basis for the economy of Prevalje, followed by trade, metal processing, traffic and building industry. In recent years services and tourism have also increased.

The biggest companies in the Prevalje as of 2003 include Lesna (furniture industry), Koratur (coach and bus companies), Prevent (textile industry), Lek (pharmaceuticals), Jamnica (trade), Paloma (paper industry), and Instalater (engineering, services). There are also several elementary schools, a nursery school, preschools, a medical clinic, a bank, and a post office in the town.

==Sports==
Prevalje Stadium, also named &quot;Športni park Ugasle peči&quot;, is a multi-purpose stadium in Prevalje. It is used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Korotan Prevalje. The stadium was built in 1942 and is able to accommodate 500 seated spectators. The club competed in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top tier of Slovenian football, for a total of nine seasons.

<doc id="977459" wikidata="Q3809556" url="?curid=977459" title="John Popham (judge)">
<text>Sir John Popham (c. 1531 – 10 June 1607) of Wellington, Somerset, was Speaker of the House of Commons (1580 to 1583), Attorney General (1581 to 1592) and Lord Chief Justice of England (1592 to 1607).

==Origins==
Popham was born in 1531 at Huntworth in the parish of North Petherton, near Bridgwater, in Somerset, the second son of Alexander Popham (c. 1504 – 1556) of Huntworth, twice MP for Bridgwater in 1545 and 1547, by his wife Jane Stradling, a daughter of Sir Edward Stradling (died 1535) of St Donat&#x27;s Castle, Glamorgan; one of Jane&#x27;s brothers is Thomas Stradling. St Donat&#x27;s Castle situated on the south coast of Glamorgan was a short sail across the Bristol Channel into the inland port of Bridgwater on the River Parret. The Popham family had held the manor of Huntworth since the 13th century when Sir Hugh de Popham (tempore Edward I) (a younger son of the Popham family of the manor of Popham, Hampshire) married Joan de Kentisbury, daughter and heiress of Sir Stephen de Kentisbury of Huntworth. His nephews included George Popham, founder of Popham Colony (of which Sir John was one of the principal financial backers) and Sir William Pole (1561–1635), the historian of Devon.

==Education==
He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he read classics and divinity, and entered the Middle Temple as a law student.

==Career==
He served as an MP for Lyme Regis in 1558 and for Bristol in 1571 and 1572 and was a Justice of the Peace in Somerset. He served in the honourable position of Recorder of Bridgwater and of Bristol. He was promoted to serjeant-at-law in 1578 and appointed Solicitor-General in 1579. In 1581 he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons and later that year was appointed Attorney-General. In 1592 following the death of Sir Christopher Wray, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench, which position he retained until his death.

Popham is credited with maintaining the stability of the British State, and for being one of the &quot;real colonisers&quot; of the British Empire; hosting two Wabanaki tribesmen kidnapped on the Maine coast in 1605, subsequently funding and orchestrating the aborted Popham Colony at the mouth of the Kennebec River, Maine (1607–1608).

Popham became a very wealthy man, and amongst the many estates he owned was Publow in Somerset, Littlecote in Wiltshire, and Hemyock Castle in Devon. In Peter Blundell&#x27;s will of 1599 Popham was asked to establish a free grammar school in the town of Tiverton in Devon, which resulted in his founding of Blundell&#x27;s School which opened in 1604 and still exists to this day.

==Famous trials==
In 1595 Popham presided over the trial of the Jesuit Robert Southwell and passed a sentence of death by hanging, drawing and quartering. He also presided over the trials of Sir Walter Raleigh (1603) and the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot, including Guy Fawkes (1606). He was also involved in the trial at Fotheringhay Castle of Mary, Queen of Scots (1587) which resulted in her execution.

While working as the messenger to the Queen, Popham was imprisoned by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex with his henchman. Ever stoic, Popham replied that at his age, death would be &quot;but cutting off a few years&quot;. However, he was rescued and rowed to safety by Sir Ferdinando Gorges (1565–1647).

He was noted for his severity towards thieves, and for strict enforcement of the Penal Laws.

==Marriage and children==
John Popham married Amy Adams (&quot;alias&quot; Games), daughter and heiress of Hugh (&quot;alias&quot; Howel) Adams (&quot;alias&quot; Games) of Castleton, Glamorgan, a fortified manor house 800 metres north-east of the village of St Athan. Castleton was from the early 12th century the caput of the lordship of St Athan established by the Nerber family, and held from the overlords the Earls of Gloucester, comprising 4 knight&#x27;s fees. John de Nerber was the last in the line, and died in the early 16th century. In 1528, &quot;by corrupt dealings&quot;, Castleton was acquired by Howel Adams. In 1538 Leland (died 1552) recorded: &quot;Castleton, a manor place on a hille ascending from the ripe. And late it (be)longgid to one Hugh Adam, a man of mene lands whos doughter is now heir of it&quot;. By his marriage Popham inherited Castleton and sold it to his maternal relative Sir Thomas Stradling of St Donat&#x27;s Castle. By his wife he had issue one son and six daughters including:
*Sir Francis Popham (c. 1573 – 1644), only son, and heir, MP, of Wellington, Somerset and Littlecote, Wiltshire, who married Anne Gardiner Dudley and was the father of Edward Popham (1610–1651), General-at-Sea, and of Colonel Alexander Popham (1605–1669), JP, MP, who fought for the Parliamentarians during the Civil War and had a garrison stationed at Littlecote House. Another of his descendants was Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham (1762–1820), who developed the Signal Code adopted by the Navy in 1803.
*Penelope Popham; 
*Elinor Popham; 
*Elizabeth Popham (d.1637), wife of Sir Richard Champernowne (1558–1622), lord of the manor of Modbury in Devon, Sheriff of Devon in 1591, created a knight of the Bath in 1599.
*Mary Popham; 
*Amy Popham.

==Residences==
===Wellington House, Somerset===

As his main residence he built Wellington House, a &quot;large and stately mansion&quot; in the town of Wellington, Somerset, &quot;only slightly smaller than Montacute&quot; also in Somerset (built in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, Master of the Rolls and the prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters). It was destroyed during the Civil War (1642–1651), having been &quot;&quot;obtained by strategem by one Bovet of Taunton who converted it into a garrison for the use of the Parliament army and defended it for a considerable time against Sir Richard Grenville who came to its rescue in which contest it was so battered that it was never afterward deemed worthy repairing&quot;.&quot; In March 1645 the Royalist commander Grenville was ordered to march into Somersetshire and assist in the siege of Taunton. While inspecting the fortifications of &quot;Wellington House&quot; he was severely wounded, and obliged for a time to resign the command of his forces to Sir John Berkeley. Wellington had probably been supplying Blake with necessaries for some time, and Colonel Bovet, a very ardent Parliamentarian, got possession of Popham&#x27;s house and made it a stronghold for his party. So against Wellington Grenville directed the Royalist force and levelled Popham&#x27;s house almost to the ground, himself being so severely injured that the leadership of his men had to be transferred to Sir John Barkley. The following document dated 19 October 1650 was addressed to Justices of Peace of Somerset:
:&quot;Anne Martyn of Wellington, widdowe, being in the howse of the Honourable Alexander Popham with her family, att the seige thereof by the late Kinge&#x27;s forces, sustayned greate losses of goodes and cattle, viz., several kine, one heifer, tenne young cattle, three calves, five colts, a mare and a horse, forty sheepe, five bedds with their furniture, bacon, butter, and cheese, wool, lynnen, corne of all sorts, pewter, brasse, and other moveable goodes, valued in all att the summe of ... hundred and threescore and fifteen poundes, besides the summe of twenty and two poundes in ready money; and that her eldest sonne was killed in the said howse by the said late Kynges forces. Signed Rich. Bouell, Alexander Popham, Edw. Popham, John Pyne.&quot;

===Littlecote House, Berkshire===
Popham acquired the reversion of the estate of Littlecote in Berkshire (today in Wiltshire) from William Darrell (1539–1589), MP, and following the latter&#x27;s death in 1589 duly became its owner. The historian John Aubrey (1626–1697) stated that Popham had acquired Littlecote as a bribe for having obtained a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in favour of the murderer William &quot;Wild&quot; Darrell, which account Rice (2005) deemed &quot;not accurate&quot; and &quot;A story of passion, murder and confusion&quot;. Popham expanded the house and added a south wing in red-brick, which structure survives today. His armorials survive above the south porch.

Following the destruction of Wellington House in the Civil War, Littlecote became the principal seat of his descendants, the last of whom in the male line was Francis Popham (died 1779), of Littlecote and Hunstrete, Somerset, who died childless. He bequeathed his estates to his wife Dorothy (née Hutton) who in turn left them to &quot;Francis Popham, the reputed son of my late husband&quot; but only as a tenant for life. This illegitimate son died in 1804 when, under the terms of Dorothy&#x27;s will, the estates reverted to her husband&#x27;s nephew Edward William Leyborne (born 1764), who in 1805 in accordance with the terms of the bequest assumed by royal licence the additional surname and arms of Popham. The Leyborne Popham family sold Littlecote in 1929 to Sir Ernest Wills, and moved to their other seat at Hunstrete House, Pensford, Somerset.

==Death and burial==
Popham died on 10 June 1607 at Wellington, Somerset. He was buried in the Church of St John the Baptist, Wellington, where his large free-standing monument survives.

==Monument, Wellington Church==
At the east end of the north aisle of St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church in Wellington, survives the 18-foot-high monument with effigies of Sir John Popham and his family. As described by Collinson (died 1793) in 1791 it was situated in the south aisle chapel, from which it has been moved to its present position, but retaining the same orientation. Collinson described the monument as follows:
:&quot;In the chapel on the south side of the church is a magnificent tomb, surrounded with a pallisado of wood and iron, on the table of which lie the effigies of Sir John Popham, and that of his lady. He is dressed in his judges robes, chain, and small square black cap; and placed with his head towards the west. On the lower basement, at the head and feet, are four other smaller figures of two men and two women, kneeling face to face. On the north side of the same basement are five boys and eight girls, dressed in black, kneeling in a row. And on the south side are nine women kneeling in the fame manner. Over Sir John and his lady is a superb arched canopy, ornamented with the family arms, roses, paintings, and obelisks; the whole supported by eight round columns of black marble, five feet high, with Corinthian capitals green and gilt&quot;.

The two male and female couples kneeling opposite each other separated by a prie-dieu, shown at each end of the monument, are believed to represent his 34-year-old son Sir Francis Popham and the latter&#x27;s wife (east-end) and his parents, represented as a middle-aged couple (west-end). The nine female kneeling figures on the south side, all facing westward, are believed to represent Sir John Popham&#x27;s six daughters with three ladies maids, the latter three figures kneeling behind the daughters and wearing plain not lace ruffs. The kneeling figures on the north side are believed to represent the five sons (facing westwards) and eight daughters (facing eastwards) of Sir Francis Popham, the son of Sir John Popham. Inscribed on a stone tablet on the west side of the entablature is the following text:
:&quot;Sr John Popham Knighte and Lord Chief Justice of England and of the Honorable Privie Councell to Queene Elizabeth and after to King James, aged 76, died the 10th of June, 1607 and is here interred.&quot;

==Heraldry==
A heraldic escutcheon is shown on the north side of the monument to Sir John Popham in Wellington Church of nine quarters as follows:

An earlier Thurstan was clerk to William de Pont de l&#x27;Arche, and was evidently the same Thurstan who was Sheriff of Hampshire in 1155 and who obtained confirmation from the Empress Maud of all his land of Popham which he had held at the death of Henry I)

<text>net.art refers to a group of artists who have worked in the medium of Internet art since 1994. Some of the early adopters and main members of this movement include Vuk Ćosić, Jodi.org, Alexei Shulgin, Olia Lialina, Heath Bunting, Daniel García Andújar, and Rachel Baker. Although this group was formed as a parody of avant garde movements by writers such as Tilman Baumgärtel, Josephine Bosma, Hans Dieter Huber and Pit Schultz, their individual works have little in common.

The term &quot;net.art&quot; is also used as a synonym for net art or Internet art and covers a much wider range of artistic practices. In this wider definition, net.art means art that uses the Internet as its medium and that cannot be experienced in any other way. Typically net.art has the Internet and the specific socio-culture that it spawned as its subject matter but this is not required.

The German critic Tilman Baumgärtel - building on the ideas of American critic Clement Greenberg - has frequently argued for a &quot;media specificity&quot; of net.art in his writings. According to the introduction to his book &quot;net.art. Materialien zur Netzkunst&quot;, the specific qualities of net.art are &quot;connectivity, global reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity and egality&quot;.

== History of the net.art movement ==

The net.art movement arose in the context of the wider development of Internet art. As such, net.art is more of a movement and a critical and political landmark in Internet art history, than a specific genre. Early precursors of the net.art movement include the international fluxus (Nam June Paik) and avant-pop (Mark Amerika) movements. The avant-pop movement particularly became widely recognized in Internet circles from 1993, largely via the popular Alt-X site.

In 1995, the term &quot;net.art&quot; was used by nettime initiator Pit Schultz as a title for an exhibition in Berlin in 1995, in which Vuk Cosic and Alexei Shulgin both showed their work. It was later used with regard to the &quot;net.art per se&quot; meeting of artists and theorists in Trieste in May 1996, and referred to a group of artists who worked together closely in the first half of the 1990s. These meetings gave birth to the website net.art per se, a fake CNN website &quot;commemorating&quot; the event. The term &quot;net.art&quot; has been wrongly attributed to artist Vuk Cosic in 1997, after Alexei Shulgin wrote about the origin of the term in a prank mail to the nettime mailinglist. According to Shulgin&#x27;s mail net.art stemmed from &quot;conjoined phrases in an email bungled by a technical glitch (a morass of alphanumeric junk, its only legible term &#x27;net.art&#x27;)&quot;. The researcher and artist Ramzi Turki uses the Facebook platform as a space for artistic exchangeFanny Drugeon, « Ramzi Turki, Le Net art et l’esthétique du partage : les murs ont aussi des yeux qui nous regardent », Critique d’art. Actualité internationale de la littérature critique sur l’art contemporain,‎ 27 mai 2020 (ISSN 1246-8258, DOI 10.4000/critiquedart.47849.

== Online social networks ==
net.artists have built digital art communities through an active practice of web hosting and web art curating. net.artists have defined themselves through an international and networked mode of communication, an interplay of exchanges, collaborative and cooperative work . They have a large presence on several mailing lists such as Rhizome, File festival, Electronic Language International Festival, Nettime, Syndicate and Eyebeam. The identity of the net.artists is defined by both their digital works and their critical involvement in the digital art community, as the polemical discussion led by Olia Lialina that occurred on Nettime in early 2006 on the &quot;New Media&quot; Wikipedia entry shows

net.artists like Jodi developed a particular form of e-mail art, or spam mail art, through text reprocessing and ASCII art. The term &quot;spam art&quot; was coined by net critique and net art practitioner Frederic Madre to describe all such forms of disruptive interventions in mailing-lists, where seemingly nonsensical texts were generated by simple scripts, online forms or typed by hand.

A connection can be made to the e-mail interventions of &quot;Codeworks&quot; artists such as Mez or mi ga or robots like Mailia which analyze emails and reply to them. &quot;Codeworks&quot; is a term coined by poet Alan Sondheim to define the textual experiments of artists playing with faux-code and non-executable script or mark-up languages.

== Tactical media net art ==
net.art developed in a context of cultural crisis in Eastern Europe in the beginning of the 1990s after the end of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The artists involved in net.art experiments are associated with the idea of a &quot;social responsibility&quot; that would answer the idea of democracy as a modern capitalist myth. The Internet, often promoted as the democratic tool par excellence, but largely participating in the rules of vested interests, is targeted by the net.artists who claimed that &quot;a space where you can buy is a space where you can steal, but also where you can distribute&quot;. net.artists focus on finding new ways of sharing public space.

By questioning structures such as the navigation window and challenging their functionality, net.artists have shown that what is considered to be natural by most Internet users is actually highly constructed, even controlled, by corporations. Company browsers like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer display user-friendly structures (the &quot;navigation&quot;, the &quot;exploration&quot; are landmarks of social practices) to provide the user with a familiar environment; net.artists try to break this familiarity. Olia Lialina, in &quot;My Boyfriend Came Back From The War&quot; or the duo Jodi, with their series of pop-up interventions and browser crashing applets, have engaged the materiality of navigation in their work. Their experiments have given birth to what could be called &quot;browser art&quot;, which has been expanded by the British collective I/O/D&#x27;s experimental navigator WebStalker.

Alexei Shulgin and Heath Bunting have played with the structure of advertisement portals by establishing lists of keywords unlikely to be searched for but nonetheless existing on the web as URLs or metadata components: they use this relational data to enmesh paths of navigation in order to create new readable texts . The user is not exploring one art website that has its own meaning and aesthetic significance within itself, but rather they are exposed to the entire network as a collection of socioeconomic forces and political stances that are not always visible.

Rachel Greene has associated net.art with tactical media as a form of Detournement. Greene writes: &quot;The subversion of corporate websites shares a blurry border with hacking and agitprop practices that would become an important field of net art, often referred to as &#x27;tactical media&#x27;.&quot;

== Hacker culture ==
The Jodi collective works with the aesthetics of computer errors, which has a lot in common, on both the aesthetic and pragmatic levels, with hacker culture. Questioning and disturbing the browsing experience with hacks, code tricks, faux-code, and faux-virus, critically investigates the context in which they are agents. In turn, the digital environment becomes concerned with its own internal structure. The collective 0100101110101101.org expands the idea of &quot;art hacktivism&quot; by performing code interventions and perturbations in art festivals such as the Venice Biennale. On the other hand, the collective expands the idea of &quot;art hacktivism&quot; by performing interventions and perturbations in the real world, acting on it as on a possible ground for social reengineering.

&quot;We can point to a superficial difference between most net.art and hacking: hackers have an obsession with getting inside other computer systems and having an agency there, whereas the 404 errors in the JTDDS (for example) only engage other systems in an intentionally wrong manner in order to store a &#x27;secret&#x27; message in their error logs. It&#x27;s nice to think of artists as hackers who endeavour to get inside cultural systems and make them do things they were never intended to do: artists as culture hackers.&quot;.

A networking expert hacked into DNS servers to have the traceroute Linux command reveal the history of star wars IV. This deep technical repurposing for the sake of enchantment and fun can be considered as a net.art performance.

Computer worms can be intentionally good and positive when they are repurposed for large-scale ephemeral art that uses the whole Internet as a canvas.

== Critique of the art world ==

During the heyday of net.art developments, particularly during the rise of global dot.com capitalism, the first series of critical columns appeared in German and English in the online publication Telepolis. Edited by writer and artist Armin Medosch, the work published at Telepolis featured American artist and net theorist Mark Amerika&#x27;s &quot;Amerika Online&quot; columns. These columns satirized the way self-effacing net.artists (himself included) took themselves too seriously. In response, European net.artists impersonated Amerika in faux emails to deconstruct his demystification of the marketing schemes most net.artists employed to achieve art world legitimacy. It was suggested that &quot;the duplicitous dispatches were meant to raise US awareness of electronic artists in Europe, and may even contain an element of jealousy.&quot;

Many of these net.art interventions also tackled the issue of art as business and investigated mainstream cultural institutions such as the Tate Modern. Harwood, a member of the Mongrel collective, in his work &quot;Uncomfortable Proximity&quot; (the first on-line project commissioned by Tate) mirrors the Tate&#x27;s own website, and offers new images and ideas, collaged from his own experiences, his readings of Tate works, and publicity materials that inform his interest in the Tate website.

net.artists have actively participated in the debate over the definition of net.art within the context of the art market. net.art promoted the modernist idea of the work of art as a &quot;process&quot;, as opposed to a conception of art as object making . Alexander R. Galloway, in an e-flux article entitled &quot;Jodi&#x27;s Infrastructure&quot; argues that Jodi&#x27;s approach to net.art, which involves the very structures that govern coding, is uniquely modernist: the form and content converge in the artwork. The presentation of this process within the art world—whether it should be sold in the market, or shown in the institutional art environment, is problematic for digital works created for the Internet. The web, as marketable as it is, cannot be restricted to the ideological dimensions of the legitimate field of art, the institution of legitimation for art value, that is both ideological and economical . &quot;All for Sale&quot; by Aliona is an early net.art experiment addressing such issues. The WWWArt Award competition initiated by Alexei Shulgin in 1995 suggests rewarding found Internet works with what he calls an &quot;art feeling.&quot;

Some projects, such as Joachim Schmid&#x27;s &quot;Archiv&quot;, &quot;Hybrids&quot;, or &quot;Copies&quot; by Eva &amp; Franco Mattes (under the pseudonym of 0100101110101101.org), are examples of how to store art-related or documentary data on a website. Cloning, plagiarizing, and collective creation are provided as alternative answers, such as in the Refresh Project.
Olia Lialina has addressed the issue of digital curating via her web platform Teleportacia.org, an online gallery to promote and sell net.art works. Each piece of net.art has its originality protected by a guarantee constituted by its URL, which acts as a barrier against reproducibility and/or forgery. Lialina claimed that this allowed the buyer of the piece to own it as they wished: controlling the location address as a means of controlling access to the piece. This attempt at giving net.art an economic identity and a legitimation within the art world was questioned even within the net.art sphere, though the project was often understood as a satire. On the other hand, Teo Spiller really sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum in May 1999, calling the whole project of selling the net.art.trade.

Teleportacia.org became an ambiguous experiment on the notion of originality in the age of extreme digital reproduction and remix culture. The guarantee of originality protected by the URL was quickly challenged by Eva &amp; Franco Mattes, who, under the pseudonym of 0100101110101101.org, cloned the content and produced an unauthorized mirror-site, showing the net.art works in the same context and the same quality as the original. &quot;The Last Real Net Art Museum&quot; is another example of Olia Lialina&#x27;s attempt to deal with the issue.

Online social networks experiments, such as the Poietic Generator, which existed before the net.art movement, was involved in it, and still exist after it, may show that the fashion scheme of net.art may have forgotten some deep theoretical questions.

<text>Andrew Cohen (born October 23, 1955) is an American cult Leader . He is an author, former editor of &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot; magazine, and founder of the global spiritual community EnlightenNext, which dissolved in 2013.

==Biography and beliefs==
Cohen was born in New York City into an upper-middle class secular Jewish family. Cohen recounts that his life was changed by a spontaneous experience of &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; at the age of sixteen. At 22 years of age and after pursuing a career as a jazz musician, he began a quest to recover his earlier spiritual experience. He eventually met H. W. L. Poonja in 1986, a student of Ramana Maharshi, who taught that no mind effort is needed to attain enlightenment &quot;because it is merely the realisation of what one already has&quot;. At their first meeting, Cohen realized that he &quot;had always been free&quot;. He claimed that Poonja declared him his heir, so Cohen began to teach as a neo-Advaita teacher, and gathered a community around him. However Cohen only spent a short time in the presence of H. W. L. Poonja, who later claimed never to have given Cohen permission to give spiritual teachings. 

Within a few years, Cohen considered that the ecstatic experiences his students had in his presence were limited. Being convinced that he himself was fully free from karmic bondage, he began to demand more commitment from his students, insisting on complete &quot;ego-transcendence&quot;. This change in teaching-style led to dissent and a break with Poonja, who Cohen felt had ethical and enlightened behavioral shortcomings.

According to Cohen, &quot;Poonja insisted that the realization of the Self had nothing to do with worldly behavior, and he did not believe fully transcending the ego was possible.&quot; According to Poonja, &quot;Karmic tendencies remained after enlightenment, [but] the enlightened person was no longer identified with them and, therefore, did not accrue further karmic consequences.&quot; For Poonja, ethical standards were based on an understanding of duality and the notion of an individual agent, and were therefore not representative of Advaita: &quot;For Poonja, the goal was the realisation of the self; the illusory realm of relative reality was ultimately irrelevant.&quot; Cohen did not agree, insisting instead on &quot;flawless behavior&quot; as the manifestation of enlightenment.

In 1991, Cohen founded &quot;EnlightenNext&quot; magazine (under its former title, &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot;), which &quot;established him as a major contemporary spiritual figure.&quot; In 2004, &quot;EnlightenNext&quot; magazine partnered with the Graduate Institute in Connecticut to offer a master&#x27;s program in conscious evolution. From 2004 to 2007, Cohen served as a core faculty of that institute. The magazine stopped publishing in 2011.

After the break with Poonja, Cohen&#x27;s teachings were further developed into &quot;Evolutionary Enlightenment&quot;, aiming at an impersonal enlightenment which transcends the personal. Yet, the change in teaching-style led also to &quot;physical force, verbal abuse, and intense psychological pressure against students.&quot; The growing complaints from students have been described in several publications from former students and from his own mother.

In 2001, Cohen co-formed the jazz-funk-fusion band Unfulfilled Desires, in which he played drums. The band played original compositions and standards, and performed in Europe and the United States. They released four CDs: &quot;Live at the Iron Horse&quot; (2002), &quot;Enlightened Dog&quot; (2004), &quot;Punk Funk&quot; (2008), and &quot;Plugged&quot; (2010).

On June 26, 2013, Cohen announced on his blog that he would be taking &quot;a sabbatical for an extended period of time&quot;, after confrontational exchanges with some of his closest students, who helped Cohen to realize, as he put it, that &quot;in spite of the depth of my awakening, my ego is still alive and well&quot;.

On May 12, 2015, Cohen posted an extensive apology letter to his former students on his blog, his first writing after emerging from a two-year sabbatical. In it he wrote about the need to embrace the spiritual principle of agape, as well as eros, and expressed regret for the ways in which his lack of the former in his teaching methods hurt and alienated many former students.

In September 2016, after over three years&#x27; absence from public life, Cohen unveiled a redesigned website. This included an announcement of his intention to return to formal teaching, beginning with a retreat planned for early 2017.

In 2020 Cohen launched Manifest Nirvana, an online meditation and teaching platform that is described on the homepage as a &quot;Home for Sovereign Souls, Radical Spirits and Integral Pioneers&quot;.

==Teachings==

===Influences===
When beginning to teach, Cohen was influenced by H. W. L. Poonja, who offered a &quot;deinstitutionalized and experiential Advaita,&quot; comparable to Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teachings, which differ from the traditional Advaita Vedanta of Shankara. He likewise credits the &quot;integral philosopher&quot; Ken Wilber, with whom he conducts frequent public discourses, with helping him form the theoretical framework of his teachings. He has also been influenced by the Spiral Dynamics theories put forward by Don Beck as an extension of the emergent cyclical theory of Clare Graves. Cohen was also inspired by Swami Krishnananda of the Divine Life Society in India, and his call &quot;In unity there is strength; come together, come together.&quot;

===Evolutionary Enlightenment===
According to Cohen, &quot;traditional&quot; enlightenment is the realisation of the transcendental aspect of God, and it often goes hand in hand with the realization that the world is an illusion.

Cohen says that he has discovered a different form of &quot;enlightened awareness,&quot; which he claims to be unique. He first called this &quot;impersonal enlightenment&quot; to reflect the fact that it was a realization shared between people rather than an individual attainment. He later changed the name to Evolutionary Enlightenment, both to reflect his belief that it indicates the next stage of the evolution of enlightenment and to convey the creative, world-embracing vision of spiritual awakening as an unending process of individual and cultural development.

A fundamental aspect of Cohen&#x27;s Evolutionary Enlightenment is the distinction between what he sees as two fundamental, yet opposing, aspects of the human psyche: the &quot;ego&quot; and the &quot;authentic self&quot;, In his teaching, ego is defined as &quot;the deeply ingrained, compulsive need to remain separate and superior at all times, in all places, under all circumstances.&quot; The authentic self, on the other hand, is defined as &quot;the urge to become more conscious&quot;.

According to Cohen and Wilber, &quot;enlightenment&quot; does not refer to an unchanging state, but has to be in accord with an ongoing evolution of humanity, which is the &quot;Authentic Self.&quot; According to Cohen, individuals need to recognize that their own spiritual transformation is essential for cultural evolution. To achieve that, in Cohen&#x27;s view, an individual should strive to realize his or her true self as being &quot;one with the timeless Ground of all Being and with the evolutionary impulse that is driving the entire cosmos.&quot;

According to Wilber, evolutionary enlightenment means &quot;the realization of oneness with all states and all stages that have evolved so far and that are in existence at any given time.&quot; Cohen believes that individuals need to transcend egoism to express the &quot;Authentic Self.&quot; Through identifying the evolutionary impulse as their own Authentic Self, individuals can transcend ego, and find a deeper self-sense without relying on asceticism or solitude.

Cohen&#x27;s ideas are co-inspired by Wilber&#x27;s Integral Theory, offering an integral vision of the integral evolution of matter and consciousness. According to this theory, human development parallels the evolution of all being.

==Award==
In May 2013, Watkins Books listed Cohen at Number 28 on their &quot;Spiritual 100&quot; list for 2012.

==Controversies==
The mental, physical, and financial abuse Cohen perpetrated against former students, which he justifies as &quot;crazy wisdom&quot; are documented in books such as &quot;American Guru&quot;, &quot;Enlightenment Blues&quot;, and &quot;Mother of God&quot;, as well as popular blogs such as &quot;What Enlightenment?&quot; and &quot;EnlightenNixt&quot;.

H. W. L. Poonja, also known as Papaji, the Indian Guru who Cohen claims called him his &quot;heir&quot; stated publicly that Cohen only spent 25 hours in satsang before proclaiming himself as enlightened. Papaji describes Cohen&#x27;s claims as the arrogance of his ego and never acknowledged Cohen as a master or heir, but rather described him as a messenger.

Poonja himself has been sharply criticized for too easily authorising students to teach:
Some of Cohen&#x27;s former followers, including his mother, Luna Tarlo, have viewed him as a manipulative spiritual teacher. Tarlo wrote a critical book, called &quot;Mother of God&quot;, about her experience as one of his disciples. In a &quot;Psychology Today&quot; article, published in 1998 entitled &quot;Crimes of the Soul&quot;, Tarlo recounted how she became a disciple of her son who told her &quot;to give way to him or their relationship would end&quot; and forbade her &quot;to express an opinion on anything&quot;. Tarlo said she &quot;knew if I seriously objected to anything, I&#x27;d be kicked out&quot; and stated that her son, formerly the &quot;sweetest, sensitive kid, had changed into an unrecognizable tyrant.&quot;

André van der Braak&#x27;s &quot;Enlightenment Blues: My Years with an American Guru&quot; alleges that Cohen demanded large sums of money and extreme and unquestioning devotion from his students.

&quot;American Guru: A Story of Love, Betrayal and Healing&quot;, by William Yenner and other former Cohen student contributors (foreword by Stephen Batchelor), allege authoritarianism, financial manipulation, physical and psychological abuse in Cohen&#x27;s community, and discusses the challenges of healing after leaving the community.

Over the years, there were many indications that Cohen&#x27;s group was in difficult financial straits. In 2011 it officially ended publication of its magazine &quot;EnlightenNext&quot;. In the summer of 2013, Cohen was accused of being a cult leader. As of early 2014, the EnlightenNext organization&#x27;s main building on its property in Lenox, Massachusetts, which had been on the market for years, remained up for sale.

In 2016, over 240 of Cohen&#x27;s former students signed an online petition titled &quot;Stop Andrew Cohen teaching again&quot;, including detailed explanations of why they believe him to be unfit to teach others.

Cohen has written for &quot;The Huffington Post,&quot; &quot;Big Think&quot;, and &quot;Speaking Tree&quot;.

<doc id="977467" wikidata="Q521746" url="?curid=977467" title="Charles Santley">
<text>Sir Charles Santley (28 February 1834 – 22 September 1922) was an English opera and oratorio singer with a &quot;bravura&quot; technique who became the most eminent English baritone and male concert singer of the Victorian era. His has been called &#x27;the longest, most distinguished and most versatile vocal career which history records.&#x27;

Santley appeared in many major opera and oratorio productions in Great Britain and North America, giving numerous recitals as well. Having made his debut in Italy in 1857 after undertaking vocal studies in that country, he elected to base himself in England for the remainder of his life, apart from occasional trips overseas. One of the highlights of his stage career occurred in 1870 when he led the cast in the first Wagner opera to be performed in London, &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Santley retired from opera during the 1870s in order to concentrate on the lucrative concert circuit.

Santley also wrote books on vocal technique and two sets of memoirs.

== Early training ==

Santley was the elder son of William Santley, a journeyman bookbinder, organist and music teacher of Liverpool in northern England. He had a brother and two sisters, one of whom named Catherine should not be confused with the actor-manager Kate Santley. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute High School, and as a boy sang alto in the choir of a local Unitarian church. His voice began to break before he was fourteen. Following musical lessons from his father (who insisted upon his singing tenor), he passed the examination for admission to the second tenors of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society on his fifteenth birthday, and in the same year took part in the concerts at the opening of the Philharmonic Hall. 

It was not until he reached the age of seventeen to eighteen that he rebelled against his father&#x27;s decree and dropped into the bass clef, and was pronounced to be a bass. Santley was apprenticed to the provision trade. He enlisted, however, as a violinist in the Festival Choral Society and the Società Armonica, and as a chorus member, with his father and sister, he sang in a performance of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; at the Collegiate Institution, Liverpool, in which Jenny Lind was a soloist. Soon afterwards he was in a hand-picked choir for Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, where the tenor Sims Reeves headed the soloists, at the Eisteddfod at Rhuddlan Castle, and was in the chorus for &quot;Elijah&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; under Julius Benedict at the Liverpool Festival. He heard Pauline Viardot, Luigi Lablache and Mario there. While acting as accompanist to his sister at St Anne&#x27;s Catholic Church, Edge Hill, Liverpool, he sang &#x27;Et incarnatus est&#x27; from Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Second Mass&quot;, reading from the same score as Julius Stockhausen, as a trial, and obtained a place as bass soloist, modelling himself upon the style of the Austrian bass Josef Staudigl (1807–1861), and of the German bass Karl Formes (1815–1889) (whom he heard as Sarastro in London).

In 1855, Santley went to Italy to study as a singer, with advice from Sims Reeves to visit Lamperti in Milan. However he chose to study under Gaetano Nava, who became his lifelong friend. Nava taught him buffo roles in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; and &quot;Il Turco in Italia&quot;, and in Mercadante&#x27;s operas, laying the basis of sound vocal technique as a baritone. He also taught him Italian speech. Santley studied duets from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Zaira&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; and &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot;. He was a frequent guest at concerts and conversaziones of the Marani family. At the theatres, he heard Antonio Giuglini, Scheggi, Marini and Enrico Delle Sedie, and saw Ristori in &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;, attending La Scala, Milan, and the Carcano Theatre. 

He made his stage debut on 1 January 1857 in Pavia as Dr Grenvill in &quot;La traviata&quot; (later in the same run singing Germont &quot;père&quot;), and Don Silva in &quot;Ernani&quot;. Other minor engagements followed, After a thin summer, however, Henry Fothergill Chorley visited and urged his return to England.

== Oratorio, 1857–1872 ==

In 1857 Santley returned to London, and made his first appearance (16 November) for John Hullah in the role of Adam in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot;: it is related that he broke down in the duet &quot;Graceful Consort&quot; owing to nerves, but the audience burst into applause for him and bade him continue. Manuel García, who heard him, offered training which Santley accepted gratefully. There were a few concerts at the Crystal Palace and elsewhere, under Chorley&#x27;s guidance, and at a Chorley party he met Gertrude Kemble, who became his wife a year later. Through her he was introduced to the salon of Henry Greville, at whose musical parties he joined company with Mario, Giulia Grisi, Italo Gardoni, Ciro Pinsuti and others.

After an audition with Michael Costa, he sang in Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;St. Paul&quot; in Manchester under Charles Hallé, and in March 1858 he first sang Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; (at Exeter Hall, Liverpool), of which he became a leading interpreter for over 50 years. From the first, he was given firm encouragement by Sims Reeves and Clara Novello, and by Mario and Grisi, with whom he sang on various occasions. At the inauguration of the original Leeds Festival of autumn 1858 he was the star performer (with Willoughby Weiss) in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; . In the autumn of 1859 he was singing items from &quot;St Paul&quot;, &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot; at the Bradford Festival, shortly before embarking on his initial operatic season.

In 1861 he sang &quot;Elijah&quot; in his first appearance at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. In July of the following year, at St James&#x27;s Hall Piccadilly, he appeared in the Philharmonic Society&#x27;s 50th Jubilee Concert, singing an item from Hummel&#x27;s &quot;Mathilde of Guise&quot;, and &quot;With Joy the Impatient Husbandman&quot; from Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;. On that occasion he shared a platform (though in separate performance) with Jenny Lind, the pianist Lucy Anderson (her last public appearance), Thérèse Tietjens, and Alfredo Piatti the cellist, under the direction of William Sterndale Bennett. Bennett had just drilled a new orchestra to a level of high efficiency, creating a sensation before a huge audience. In 1862 Santley appeared at the Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace.

The year 1863 saw his first appearance at the Worcester and Norwich festivals: at Worcester he sang in Schachner&#x27;s new work &quot;Israel&#x27;s return from Babylon&quot;, and at Norwich he introduced Julius Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Richard Coeur de Lion&quot;, a great success. In April 1864 he sang in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, and in a miscellaneous concert, at Stratford-upon-Avon for the Shakespeare centenary festival. At the Hereford Festival he sang the second part of &quot;The Creation&quot;, an English version of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; and Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Richard&quot;. At the Birmingham festival of 1864 was given Michael Costa&#x27;s new work &quot;Naaman&quot;, where (as Elisha) he sang opposite Sims Reeves and the young Adelina Patti (then making her first appearance in oratorio). Santley also appeared there in &quot;Messiah&quot; and Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Masque at Kenilworth&quot;.

The autumn of 1865 witnessed his debut appearance at the Gloucester Festival, where he sang &quot;Elijah&quot;, the first part of &quot;St. Paul&quot;, part of &quot;Messiah&quot;, and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;First Walpurgis Night&quot;. In 1866 he was at Worcester Festival, and then at Norwich, where Costa&#x27;s &quot;Naaman&quot; was given again, in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Benedict&#x27;s new cantata &quot;St Cecilia&quot; (libretto by Chorley) was introduced. At Hereford in 1867 the main event for Santley was singing with the famous soprano Jenny Lind for the first time, in the oratorio &quot;Ruth&quot; by Otto Goldschmidt. There, and at Birmingham festival, Willoughby Weiss took most of the sacred bass or baritone roles. Santley sang bass arias from the &quot;Messiah&quot;, Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot;, Benedict&#x27;s &quot;St Cecilia&quot; and J. F. Barnett&#x27;s &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot;.

Returning to the Birmingham Festival in 1867 he was a soloist in the premiere of the Sacred Cantata The Woman of Samaria by William Sterndale Bennett, conducted by the composer.

At the Handel Festival in June 1868 he sang the &quot;Messiah&quot; solos, and on the selection day, &#x27;O voi dell&#x27;Erebo&#x27; from &quot;La Resurrezione&quot; and &#x27;O ruddier than the cherry&#x27; from &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. He also sang &#x27;The Lord is a Man of War&#x27; with Signor Foli. At Hereford he sang Dr Wesley&#x27;s anthem &quot;The Wilderness&quot;, and under Dr Wesley, &quot;Elijah&quot;, with Louisa Pyne. In 1869 a Rossini festival took place at the Crystal Palace, with a chorus and orchestra of about 3,000, in which he sang in the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, and appeared in the scene of the &#x27;Blessing of the Banners&#x27; from &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot;. In mid-May he sang in the first performance in England of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Petite Messe Solennelle&quot;, with the dramatic soprano Thérèse Tietjens, Pietro Mongini and the mezzo-soprano Sofia Scalchi. It was also performed that year at the Worcester and Norwich festivals. At Worcester, Reeves, Santley, Trebelli and Tietjens gave the first performance of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, under the composer&#x27;s baton. At Norwich there was also Hugo Pierson&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Hezekiah.&quot;

At the close of the 1868–69 season of the Philharmonic Society of London Santley, Tietjens and Nilsson took part in the final supernumerary concert, held at St James&#x27;s Hall for the first time before the Society moved there permanently in the next season. These three singers were among the original ten recipients to be awarded the Society&#x27;s gold medal at its first presentation in 1871.

In early 1870, as his departure from the theatre was approaching, Santley sang at concerts in London and at Exeter Hall. Then, under the management of George Wood, he made a six-week concert tour of the provinces. The touring company included Clarice Sinico, the violinist August Wilhelmj and the pianist Arabella Goddard (later joined by Ernst Pauer). Santley&#x27;s concert singing reached a high point of acclaim during his subsequent United States and Canadian tour of 1871–72. In such songs as &quot;To Anthea&quot;, &quot;Simon the Cellarer&quot; and the &quot;Maid of Athens&quot;, he was viewed as being unapproachable, and his oratorio singing was praised for perpetuating the finest traditions of the art form. In 1872, he took part in a joint recital with Pauline Rita at St James&#x27;s Hall, London.

== Operatic career 1857–1876 ==

===The early years===
In the first years after his return to England, Santley used often to sing buffo duets (for example &#x27;Che l&#x27;antipatica vostra figura&#x27; from Ricci&#x27;s &quot;Chiara di Rosemberg&quot;) with Giorgio Ronconi and Giovanni Belletti, at parties held by the influential critic H. F. Chorley. In 1859 he made his debut at Covent Garden as Hoel in Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Dinorah&quot;. In the same season he sang in the English &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (Di Luna), &quot;The Rose of Castille&quot;, &quot;Satanella&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, and as Rhineberg in Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Lurline&quot;, with William Harrison and Louisa Pyne. Wallace transcribed the latter role (originally for bass) to suit his higher register, and composed the character&#x27;s part in the final act expressly for him. &quot;Dinorah&quot; also received a royal command performance before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He was also able to fit in performances of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; in Manchester, with Sims Reeves and Catherine Hayes, for Charles Hallé. These were twice repeated at the residence of Lord Ward in Park Lane, London.

Santley appeared in English opera for Mapleson at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the 1860–61 season. Mapleson mounted a new opera, George Alexander Macfarren&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, featuring a cast led by Sims Reeves and stage-debutante Helen Lemmens-Sherrington, under the direction of Charles Hallé. In the same season Santley sang (for Pyne and Harrison) &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, &quot;La Reine Topaze&quot;, &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; (with Mme Parepa), &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Amber Witch&quot;, which later transferred to Drury Lane. He was announced to sing in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Giulia Grisi in 1861, but the promotion collapsed.

For the season of 1861–62, Santley returned to Covent Garden, opening in Howard Glover&#x27;s &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; (as Don Sallust, Harrison as Ruy Blas), then in a re-cast version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, and finally in Balfe&#x27;s &quot;The Puritan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He also created the role of &#x27;Danny Man&#x27; in Julius Benedict&#x27;s &quot;The Lily of Killarney&quot;, which was performed nightly for five or six weeks. Worn out by this busy season, Santley decided to turn his attention to Italian opera, and, armed with a letter from Michael Costa, paid a visit to Rossini in Paris. This meeting proved disappointing; but he made an Italian début at Covent Garden in 1862 when he sang the role of di Luna in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; for three nights at Covent Garden, &#x27;in place of Graziani, to oblige Mr. Gye&#x27;: that was with the English soprano Fanny Gordosa, Constance Nantier-Didiée, the Italian dramatic tenor Enrico Tamberlik and the Franco-Italian bass-baritone Joseph Tagliafico. Santley&#x27;s performances were received rapturously by the Covent Garden audience.

===Mapleson&#x27;s Italian Opera===

Mapleson won Santley back for his own Italian opera company, and in the 1862–63 season at Majesty&#x27;s, he performed in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (as Di Luna), &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (as Almaviva) and &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (as de Nevers). He returned to Covent Garden for the English Opera, however, appearing in &quot;the Lily of Killarney&quot;, &quot;Dinorah&quot;, and Balfe&#x27;s &quot;The Armourer of Nantes&quot;. In defence of his decision to move to Italian opera, Santley notes that since 1859-60 he had been singing about 110 opera performances per season, in addition to fulfilling concurrent concert engagements.

With Mapleson&#x27;s Italian Opera he joined some of the 19th century&#x27;s most celebrated singers, including Thérèse Tietjens, Marietta Alboni, Antonio Giuglini and Zelia Trebelli. Once the 1862–63 season was over, Santley paid a visit to Paris and saw Mme Carvalho perform in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which Mapleson had obtained for the 1863 season in London. In the new season (begun with &quot;Il trovatore&quot;), Carvalho and Santley appeared together in the premiere of Schira&#x27;s &quot;Niccolo de&#x27; Lapi&quot;, Santley creating the title-role. He also played the elder Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;.

The first performance of &quot;Faust&quot; in England followed. It was given in a problematic English translation by Henry Fothergill Chorley, which nevertheless remained the standard translation until well into the 20th century. Santley appeared as Valentine. The other cast members were Tietjens (as Marguerite), Trebelli (Siebel), Antonio Giuglini (Faust) and Edouard Gassier (Mephisto). In July 1863 the company performed Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot; with Reeves, Tietjens, Alboni and Alessandro Bettini. Santley appeared as Scherasmin. In the autumn, after the Worcester and Norwich festivals, Santley joined the Mapleson company&#x27;s annual tour, beginning in Dublin. Sims Reeves had joined the company to perform the roles of Edgardo, Huon and Faust (with Tietjens and Trebelli as his partners).

After hearing Santley&#x27;s Valentine, Gounod composed the aria &quot;Even bravest heart&quot; expressly for him to an original English text by Chorley (now, ironically, better known in French translation as &quot;Avant de quitter&quot; or in Italian as &quot;Dio possente&quot;) and this was introduced in London in January 1864 at the opening of the spring session. Also appearing in this production were Reeves, Lemmens-Sherrington and Salvatore Marchesi (the latter as Mephisto). Late in the run, however, Santley took on the role of Mephisto, in an &#x27;abominable red costume&#x27;. &quot;Faust&quot; was later produced with Tietjens, Gardoni, Trebelli, and Signor Junca, with Santley resuming his place. In the same season he appeared in the English premiere of Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Die Lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot; and in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Mireille&quot; (with Giuglini and Tietjens). He appeared, too, as Plunkett in &quot;Martha&quot;, as the Duke in &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, and as the Minister in &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

===The company in transition===
After the festival season, Santley toured in Mapleson&#x27;s company during the autumn (with Italo Gardoni as lead tenor), appearing in &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Oberon&quot; and &quot;Mireille&quot;, In November 1864 he set off for Barcelona, where he was booked for a three-month season at the Liceu. His Di Luna was warmly received, and he followed with his first &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and &quot;La traviata&quot;. He also played Enrico in &quot;Lucia&quot;, Obertal in &quot;Le Prophète&quot;, and Renato in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. He arrived back in Britain to join Mapleson&#x27;s spring tour at Dublin, on the same day stepping in at Tietjens&#x27;s insistence to save a failing production of &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;. During this tour he also performed Carlo Quinto in &quot;Ernani&quot; for the first time and sang at the Theatre Royal at Liverpool, the fulfilment of a childhood ambition.

In the spring of 1865, Giuglini left the company, and the Croatian diva Ilma de Murska joined it, appearing in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. Santley took on three new roles: Papageno in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot;, Creonte in Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; and Pizarro in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; (opposite Tietjens). In September there was a short touring season, in which he played Don Giovanni (with Mario) for the first time, at Manchester. He also sang Caspar in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; in London in October. Santley then went on to appear in a season at La Scala, Milan, where &quot;Il trovatore&quot; was staged for his debut there as de Luna (he alone of all the cast was not hooted by the audience), as well as Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Il Templario&quot; (in which he sang the role of Brian the Templar). Returning to London in March 1866, Santley appeared in the spring season with Tietjens, Gardoni and Gassier in &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;. He also sang in &quot;Dinorah&quot; (with de Murska and Gardoni) and &quot;Ernani&quot; (with Tietjens, Tasca and Gassier). During the autumn, he performed as Leporello in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s.

The year 1867 brought the engagement of Sweden&#x27;s Christine Nilsson, and Santley appeared with her in &quot;La traviata&quot; and &quot;I Lombardi&quot;. &quot;La forza del destino&quot; was also given, along with &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Dinorah&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;Oberon&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. After the autumn tour with Alessandro Bettini in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, the November session opened with &quot;Faust&quot;, followed by &quot;La traviata&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot;, and &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, in which Santley first sang the part of Antonio. &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, with Clara Louise Kellogg as Zerlina and Santley as Leporello, proved to be the final operatic performance of that season: Santley had been due to play Pizarro, when the news came to him, while he was appearing in concert in Brighton, that Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre had been burnt to the ground. Santley had sung the last notes ever to be heard in that theatre.

===After the fire===
The company presented a fresh season, commencing in March 1868 at Drury Lane. In it, Santley sang Fernando in &quot;La Gazza Ladra&quot; with Kellogg, Trebelli, Bettini and Foli, and the title role in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Kellogg and the prominent tenor Gaetano Fraschini. Also produced at Drury Lane that season were &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;La Figlia del Reggimento&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot; (with Nilsson as Marguerite). At Nilsson&#x27;s benefit concert, Santley played the final scene of &quot;I Due Foscari&quot;, and his Doge was compared favourably to Ronconi&#x27;s.

In July Santley appeared in &quot;Le Nozze&quot; at the Crystal Palace. The London autumn season was held at Covent Garden, with Santley&#x27;s old hero Karl Formes joining the tour cast. The American soprano Minnie Hauk also appeared (in &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;). During the ensuing tour, Santley sang Tom Tug in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;The Waterman&quot; for the first time, at Leeds. The next season, he sang it twice more in Leeds, and once each in Sheffield and Bradford. The airs from &quot;The Waterman&quot; &#x27;The jolly young waterman&#x27; and &#x27;Then farewell, my trim-built wherry&#x27; were sung by Santley to acclaim.

Her Majesty&#x27;s remained closed, and in 1869 Mapleson was drawn into a merger with the Royal Italian Opera. With the merged company, Santley performed in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Vanzini, Scalchi, Mongini and Foli, in &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;Fidelio&quot;, in &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; with di Murska and in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. &quot;La Gazza Ladra&quot; was also staged with Santley appearing opposite Trebelli, Bettini and Patti. Santley led the cast, with Nilsson as his Ophelia, in the London premiere of &quot;Hamlet&quot; by Ambroise Thomas. He enjoyed the role, which was sung in Italian, apart from the &#x27;Brindisi&#x27;. He also played Hoel in &quot;Dinorah&quot; opposite Patti, and although a planned partnership with her in &quot;L&#x27;Etoile du Nord&quot; did not occur, they did perform &quot;Rigoletto&quot; together for Patti&#x27;s benefit. Santley&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; was repeated in the autumn, with de Murska replacing Nilsson, and with Karl Formes as the ghost.

Early in 1870 the company made an operatic tour of Scotland, during which Santley sang Don Giovanni. At Drury Lane, in the following Italian season managed by George Wood, Santley sang The Dutchman in &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (in Italian, as &quot;L&#x27;Ollandese Dannato&quot;), opposite di Murska, and with Signor Foli as Daland. This was the first presentation of a Wagner opera in London. It took place in July 1870. But several other promised productions either did not occur &quot;(Macbeth&quot;, Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Les Deux Journees&quot;, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Tancredi&quot;) or the baritone role in them was given to another artist. (Lothario in Thomas&#x27; &quot;Mignon&quot;, for example, was assigned not to Santley but to the French baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure).

===Attempt to found an English lyric theatre===
Rather than accept another season with the joint company, Santley decided to establish a new English Opera enterprise at the Gaiety Theatre, working with the theatre&#x27;s music director and conductor, Meyer Lutz. In autumn 1870 he launched a successful nine-week run at the Gaiety with Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Zampa&quot;. He refused to sing &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; but he did stage &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (with himself in title role), and, in the lead-up to Christmas, &quot;The Waterman&quot;. Performances of &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; continued through February 1871, while Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;Czar und Zimmerman&quot; (as &quot;Peter the Shipwright&quot;) was staged for Easter. This production proved a success but Santley could not persuade the Gaiety&#x27;s manager, John Hollingshead, to produce Auber&#x27;s &quot;Le Cheval de bronze&quot; as a follow-up. Feeling that his long-cherished project of an English lyric theatre could never be accomplished, he decided to turn his back on the stage altogether. Instead, in 1872–1873, he set out on a concert tour of in the United States and Canada.

===With Carl Rosa&#x27;s company===
The concert tour itself was not a financial success. Santley therefore entered into an agreement with Carl Rosa to join his Italian season in New York City in March 1872; but he joined them first for the English season to play &quot;Zampa&quot; and &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, at Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark and elsewhere. He played Valentin in &quot;Faust&quot; at Philadelphia. In the Italian season, from mid-March to the end of April, he was with Mme Parepa-Rosa, Adelaide Phillips and the tenor Theodore Wachtel (1823–1893), and with Karl Formes, who sang Marcel in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; with Santley (Saint-Bris), at the Academy of Music in New York under Adolph Neuendorff. Santley was also particularly proud to have sung once in that season with his friend and idol, Giorgio Ronconi, who was Leporello to Santley&#x27;s Don Giovanni. The company also played &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Guglielmo Tell&quot;. The houses and receipts were enormous, and they sailed to England well pleased in early May 1872.

In 1873 Carl Rosa invited Santley to appear as Telramund in a planned English &quot;Lohengrin&quot; at Drury Lane. Santley accepted, but the project failed with the untimely death of Mme Parepa-Rosa. (&quot;Lohengrin&quot; was not heard in London until 1875). Santley&#x27;s wish to play Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; also remained unrealised. He disliked the prominence of the Wagnerian orchestra and regretted the innovation which saw orchestral players being relegated to a pit beneath the opera stage.

However, in 1875 Carl Rosa tempted him back to the stage for a season at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London, in which he played in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;The Siege of Rochelle&quot; (as Michel), Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;The Water Carrier&quot; (Mikelì) and &quot;The Porter of Havre&quot; (Martin). In Figaro he was cast as Almaviva, but was transferred to the role of Figaro, singing with Sig. Campobello (Almaviva), Aynsley Cook (Bartolo), Charles Lyall (Basilio), Ostava Torriani (Contessa), Rose Hersee (Susanna), Josephine York (Cherubino) and Mrs Aynsley Cook (Marcellina). This received a special performance for the Prince and Princess of Wales. There was a provincial tour in the autumn.

In autumn 1876 at the Lyceum Theatre, again with Carl Rosa, Santley revived his &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, this time in English, with Ostava Torriani as Senta. Between the London season and the provincial tour which followed they performed it 50 times. Among the cities visited were Edinburgh (four performances) and Glasgow (two performances).
In the same season they undertook a work new to him, Nicolo&#x27;s &quot;Joconde&quot;, and he played &quot;Zampa&quot; and &quot;The Porter of Havre&quot; again. The final work was a new opera with a role (Claude Melnotte) written especially for him, the &quot;Pauline&quot; of F. H. Cowen: the work was not successful. The tour took them to Dublin, Sheffield, Hanley and Birmingham. That, apart from two appearances as Sir Harry in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; at Drury Lane benefits, and his eventual farewell appearance at Covent Garden in 1911, was the end of his stage career.

== Later years ==
Santley gave recitals at the Monday Popular Concerts, and appeared with the Joachim String Quartet and Mme Clara Schumann. He settled down to concert and oratorio work in England. 

Santley, to whom European travel had been a holiday routine for many years, toured in Australia and New Zealand in 1889–1890, to the United States and Canada in 1891 and South Africa in 1893 and again in 1903. He sang last at the Birmingham festival in 1891 after an unbroken series of thirty years of appearances there. George Bernard Shaw, describing Santley as the hero of the 1894 Handel Festival, remarked especially on his &quot;Honour and Arms&quot; and &quot;Nasce al Bosco&quot;. &#x27;Santley&#x27;s singing of the division of Selection Day was, humanly speaking, perfect. It tested the middle of his voice from C to C exhaustively; and that octave came out of the test hall-marked; there was not a scrape on its fine surface, not a break or a weak link in the chain anywhere; while the vocal touch was impeccably light and steady, and the florid execution accurate as clockwork.&#x27; In these two arias his entire compass from low G to top E flat, and in &quot;Nasce al Bosco&quot; the top E natural and F, were exhibited &#x27;in such a way as made it impossible for him to conceal any blemish, if there had been one.&#x27;
In January 1894 he was with Clara Butt, Edward Lloyd, Antoinette Sterling and other singers at the first of the Chappell&#x27;s Ballad Concerts, when they were transferred from St James&#x27;s Hall to Queen&#x27;s Hall. From 1894 Santley devoted his time increasingly to teaching: between 1903 and 1907 he trained the Australian baritone Peter Dawson, taking him meticulously through &quot;Messiah&quot;, &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;Elijah&quot;. Indeed, in 1904 he brought Dawson in on a tour of the West Country, beginning at Plymouth, led by Emma Albani, with William Green (tenor), Giulia Ravogli, Johannes Wolf, Adela Verne and Theodore Flint.

In January 1907 he sang &quot;Elijah&quot; at Manchester Town Hall, having sung &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Elijah&quot; every year there since 1858. He celebrated the jubilee of his singing career in the company of many of his musician friends at a grand benefit concert held at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 May 1907. He was knighted (the first singer to receive this honour) in December of that year, after singing at Bristol, and sang Elijah at Hanley two days later. Over the next months he gave short recitals at Liverpool and sang &quot;Elijah&quot; at Edinburgh. He made his Covent Garden farewell in 1911 as Tom Tug in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;The Waterman&quot;. In 1915, at the request of London&#x27;s Lady Mayoress, he sang at the Mansion House concert for Belgian refugees, when the accurate intonation, fine quality and vigour of his voice were still apparent.

== Vocal character ==
In addition to a &#x27;haunting&#x27; beauty of timbre, Santley&#x27;s technique and musicianship made him a master in the singing of Handel or Mozart, where a fresh and accurate management of rhythm and roulade created an effect of spontaneity, vigour and ideal phrasing. His ensemble singing was also noted, for example, as Figaro and in &quot;Fidelio&quot;. Henry J. Wood observed that his compass ranged from the bass E-flat to the baritone top G, and was exceptionally even throughout. &#x27;All his low F&#x27;s told – even to the remotest corners of the largest concert-hall while his top F&#x27;s were as a silver trumpet.&#x27; His clarity and freedom from strain enabled him to continue singing with remarkable freshness throughout a career lasting more than 60 years, perhaps partly because he had not over-taxed his voice by remaining for too long on the operatic stage.

George Bernard Shaw, who first saw him on stage as Di Luna in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, considered that Santley&#x27;s dramatic powers were &#x27;blunt, unpractised, and prone to fall back on a good-humoured nonchalance in his relations with the audience, which was highly popular, but which destroyed all dramatic illusion. He was always Santley, the good fellow with no nonsense about him, and a splendid singer... The nonchalance was really diffidence...&#x27; He played Valentin, in &quot;Faust&quot;, &#x27;in an unfinished, hail-fellow-well-met way.&#x27; Later on, as Vanderdecken, etc., &#x27;his dramatic grip was much surer; and at the present moment [1892], on the verge of his sixtieth year, he is a more thorough artist than ever.&#x27;

==Personal life==
Santley married twice, first (in 1858) to Gertrude Kemble (granddaughter of Charles Kemble), who before her marriage had a professional career as a soprano singer. Their daughter Edith also became a concert singer. Gertrude died in 1882. The couple had five children. 

Santley&#x27;s second marriage, on 7 January 1884, was to Elizabeth Mary Rose-Innes (), eldest daughter of George () Rose-Innes, a Valparaíso merchant and banker whose father was British. They had one son.

Santley converted to Roman Catholicism in 1880, and in 1887 Pope Leo XIII created him a Knight Commander of St Gregory the Great.

== Recordings ==
Charles Santley made a few recordings, mostly of ballads. His earlier series was made for the Gramophone Company (His Master&#x27;s Voice) in 1903. Although the voice lacks much of its former brilliant resonance due to age it remains firm and steady. His most famous record preserves his remarkably vivid and lively rendering of &#x27;Non piu andrai&#x27; (Figaro), employing a &quot;portamento&quot; (notably on the word &#x27;narcisetto&#x27;, usually broken by modern interpreters) that is fit to satisfy Garcia himself. He did not commit any souvenirs of his Handel performances to disc. His 1903 discs are:
*2-2862 Simon the Cellarer (Hatton) (10&quot;) 
*2-2863 The vicar of Bray (10&quot;) 
*052000 Ehi capitano/Non piu andrai (Figaro – Mozart) (12&quot;) 
*2-2864 To Anthea (Hatton) (10&quot;)
*02015 Thou&#x27;rt passing hence, my brother (Sullivan) (12&quot;)

Several years later he cut a group of ballad titles for the Columbia label. Hatton&#x27;s &#x27;To Anthea&#x27; and &#x27;Simon the Cellarer&#x27; are characteristic of Santley&#x27;s earlier ballad repertoire, and are repeated in the Columbia series, which also includes Ethelbert Nevin&#x27;s &#x27;My Rosary&#x27;, C.V. Stanford&#x27;s &#x27;Father O&#x27;Flynn,&#x27; Sullivan&#x27;s &#x27;Thou&#x27;rt passing hence, my brother,&#x27; and other titles.

== Books ==
Santley&#x27;s publications include the following:
*&quot;Method of Instruction for a Baritone Voice&quot;, a translation of &quot;Metodo pratico di vocalizzazione, per le voci de basso e baritono&quot; by G. Nava (London, c 1872)
*&quot;Student and Singer, Reminiscences of Charles Santley&quot; (Macmillan, London 1893)

*&quot;Reminiscences of my Life&quot; (Isaac Pitman, London 1909)

Of the volumes of reminiscences, &quot;Student and Singer&quot; deals with his career up to circa 1870, and &quot;Reminiscences of My Life&quot; includes material for the later period.

<doc id="977468" wikidata="Q1881476" url="?curid=977468" title="MH Message Handling System">
<text>The MH Message Handling System is a free, open source e-mail client. It is different from almost all other mail reading systems in that, instead of a single program, it is made from several different programs which are designed to work from the command line provided by the shell on Unix-like operating systems. Another difference is that rather than storing multiple messages in a single file, messages each have their own separate file in a special directory. Taken together, these design choices mean that it is very easy and natural to script actions on mail messages using the normal shell scripting tools. 

Descendants of MH continue to be developed under the names of nmh and mmh. GNU Mailutils also contains an implementation of MH.

== Design ==

Designed with the Unix philosophy in mind, MH is composed of separate programs such as codice_1, to view a message, codice_2, to see message titles and codice_3 to remove messages. By using the codice_4 program, it is possible to select messages, based on sender for example, which the other programs act on.

Because the different programs are run separately and at different times, communication between them has to be arranged specially. Information such as the mail which is currently selected is stored in files (in this case by an codice_5 file in the user&#x27;s MH directory tree).

== History ==

MH was proposed by R. Stockton Gaines and Norman Shapiro and developed by Bruce S. Borden and others at RAND Corporation. The initial version of MH had been created by 1979. Subsequently development was taken over by Marshall T. Rose and John L. Romine working at University of California, Irvine. The last release of MH was 6.8.4 which was a maintenance patch for the 6.8.3 release, and it&#x27;s in the public domain.

nmh (&quot;new MH&quot;) is a current active version of MH. It was forked from version MH 6.8.3 by Richard Coleman while working at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and released under the BSD License. It incorporates the &quot;LBL changes&quot; made to MH in the late 80s by Van Jacobson, Mike Karels and Craig Leres. The most recent release is nmh 1.8, 18 February 2023. .

mmh (&quot;meillo&#x27;s mail handler&quot;) is a fork of nmh, but their user interface are incompatible.

== Performance ==

The performance of MH is very much dependent on the file system and other features of the operating system that it runs on. Every read of a message will require starting a separate program, a directory scan in a large directory and a file open before the data can even be accessed. On the other hand, mailbox formats such as mbox which use a single file often require insertion or removal of data in the middle of the file when messages are read or altered and this can be a very slow procedure. In these cases MH will be much faster.

The maildir storage format made popular by qmail and the Courier Mail Server improves upon several features first shown in MH: a separate file per message, a separate directory per mail &quot;folder,&quot; and exploitation of hardlinks and other advanced filesystem features for improved performance in space and time.

== Interface ==
MH is inherently a command line based system. For a graphical interface, the original program was &quot;xmh&quot;, an X Window System application. After development of xmh ceased, a similar tool called &quot;exmh&quot; was developed in Tcl/Tk; and last updated January 7, 2004. Exmh is considered feature-complete and there has been little development beyond bug fixes. An Emacs interface to MH is also provided by the &quot;MH-E&quot; project. 

In addition to these dedicated MH clients, support for MH mailboxes is included in several other clients such as Claws Mail, Novell Evolution, Mutt and Sylpheed.

<text>The , or the Amur River Society, was a prominent paramilitary, ultranationalist group in Japan.

==History==

The &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; was founded in 1901 by martial artist Uchida Ryohei as a successor to his mentor Mitsuru Tōyama&#x27;s &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot;. Its name is derived from the translation of the Amur River, which is called Heilongjiang or &quot;Black Dragon River&quot; in Chinese (黑龍江?), read as &quot;Kokuryū-kō&quot; in Japanese. Its public goal was to support efforts to keep the Russian Empire north of the Amur River and out of East Asia.

The &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; initially made strenuous efforts to distance itself from the criminal elements of its predecessor, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot;. As a result, its membership included Cabinet Ministers and high-ranking military officers as well as professional intelligence operatives. However, as time passed, it found the use of criminal activities to be a convenient means to an end for many of its operations.

The Society published a journal, the &quot;Kokuryū Kaiho&quot; (&quot;Amur Bulletin&quot;) and operated an espionage training school, from which it dispatched agents to gather intelligence on Russian activities in Russia, Manchuria, Korea and China. Ikki Kita was sent to China as a special member of the organization. It also pressured Japanese politicians to adopt a strong foreign policy. The &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; also supported Pan-Asianism, and lent financial support to revolutionaries such as Sun Yat-sen and Emilio Aguinaldo.

During the Russo-Japanese War, annexation of Korea and Siberian Intervention, the Imperial Japanese Army made use of the &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; network for espionage, sabotage and assassination. They organized Manchurian guerrillas against the Russians from the Chinese warlords and bandit chieftains in the region, the most important being Marshal Zhang Zuolin. The Black Dragons waged a very successful psychological warfare campaign in conjunction with the Japanese military, spreading disinformation and propaganda throughout the region. They also acted as interpreters for the Japanese army.

The &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; assisted the Japanese spy, Colonel Motojiro Akashi. Akashi, who was not directly a member of the Black Dragons, ran successful operations in China, Manchuria, Siberia and established contacts throughout the Muslim world. These contacts in Central Asia were maintained through World War II. The Black Dragons also formed close contact and even alliances with Buddhist sects throughout Asia.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; evolved into more of a mainstream political organization, and publicly attacked liberal and leftist thought. Although it never had more than several dozen members at any one time during this period, the close ties of its membership to leading members of the government, military and powerful business leaders gave it a power and influence far greater than most other ultranationalist groups. In 1924, retired naval captain Yutaro Yano and his associates within the Black Dragon Society invited Oomoto leader Onisaburo Deguchi on a journey to Mongolia. Onisaburo led a group of Oomoto disciples, including Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba.

Initially directed only against Russia, in the 1930s, the &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; expanded its activities around the world, and stationed agents in such diverse places as Ethiopia, Turkey, Morocco, throughout Southeast Asia and South America, as well as Europe and the United States.

The &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot; was officially disbanded by order of the American Occupation authorities in 1946. According to Brian Daizen Victoria&#x27;s book, &quot;Zen War Stories&quot;, the Black Dragon Society was reconstituted in 1961 by Ōmori Sōgen as the Black Dragon Club (&quot;Kokuryū-Kurabu&quot;) with the aim to &quot;succeed to the spirit of the [prewar] Black Dragon Society and promote the [Shōwa] restoration.&quot; According to Victoria, the Kokuryū-Kurabu never attracted more than 150 members.

==Activities in the United States==
The Ethiopian Pacific Movement and the Peace Movement of Ethiopia (both African-American black nationalist organizations) claimed they were affiliated with the Black Dragon Society.

As part of their effort to support such organizations, the Black Dragon Society sent an agent, Satokata Takahashi, to promote pan-Asianism and claim that Japan would treat them as racial equals. He would become a patron of Noble Drew Ali and the Moorish Science Temple of America, Elijah Muhammed and the Nation of Islam, as well as the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World. Sankichi Takahashi may have also been a member.

Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, who led the Peace Movement of Ethiopia, claimed to be personally affiliated with the &quot;Kokuryūkai&quot;.

On March 27, 1942, FBI agents arrested members of the Black Dragon Society in the San Joaquin Valley, California.

In the Manzanar Internment Camp, a small group of pro-Imperial Japanese flew Black Dragon flags and intimidated other Japanese inmates.

== In popular culture ==
A fictionalized version of the Black Dragon Society &quot;featured in much of American popular culture&quot;. It appeared in &quot;Master Comics&quot; starting with issue 21, first published by Fawcett Comics on December 10, 1941. Initially displayed as an external threat, the Black Dragon Society was given elements of a fifth column after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which reflected the fear of subversion of American society by Japanese-Americans. In DC&#x27;s &quot;All Star Comics&quot; from 1942 the Society functioned as an opponent of the Justice Society of America and were likewise presented as an example of &quot;alleged Japanese American perfidy&quot;. Another fictionalized version of the Black Dragon Society is featured in the CBS television series &quot;Raven&quot;, where they are a ninja clan operating in Hawaii.

<text>Heavy ConstruKction is a live three CD set by the band King Crimson, released by Discipline Global Mobile records on 1 December 2000. The album features recordings of the European tour of May to July 2000, from DATs made at the front-of-house mixing desk.

King Crimson&#x27;s 2000 European tour was conducted to promote the studio album &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot;. The band members at the time of the tour were the &quot;double duo&quot; quartet of guitarists Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew, Warr guitarist Trey Gunn and drummer Pat Mastelotto. Longtime drummer Bill Bruford had left the group in 1997, and bassist Tony Levin was not included in this particular King Crimson lineup due to other musical commitments.

The third disc features improvisations from different shows, which are often spliced together to create, according to the liner notes, &quot;a cohesive presentation out of a series of incoherent events&quot;.

*Disc 2 of the album contained video footage, playable with Windows Media Player software. A password was required to access this video footage.

<doc id="977486" wikidata="Q2052021" url="?curid=977486" title="William McGregor Paxton">
<text>William McGregor Paxton (June 22, 1869 – 1941) was an American painter and instructor who embraced the Boston School and was a co-founder of The Guild of Boston Artists. He taught briefly while a student at Cowles Art School, where he met his wife Elizabeth Okie Paxton, and at the Museum of Fine Arts School in Boston. Paxton is known for his portraits, including those of two presidents—Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge—and interior scenes with women, including his wife. His works are in many museums in the United States.

==Early life==
He was born on June 22, 1869, in Baltimore to James and Rose Doherty Paxton. William&#x27;s father moved the Paxton family and established a catering business in Newton Corner, Massachusetts, in the mid-1870s.

==Education==
Paxton attended Cowles Art School on a scholarship he attained at the age of 18. He studied with Dennis Miller Bunker and Cowles and then went to Paris to study under Jean-Léon Gérôme, at École des Beaux-Arts. Maryhill Museum of Art said he also studied at Académie Julian in Paris. He returned to Cowles and studied with Joseph DeCamp, who also taught Elizabeth Vaughan Okie. She became Paxton&#x27;s student and then his wife.

==Marriage==
Paxton became engaged in 1896 to Elizabeth Vaughan Okie, and they married on January 3, 1899. They traveled to Europe together and often spent their summers on Cape Cod and Cape Ann. They lived in Newton, Massachusetts, first on Elmwood Street with his parents. About 1916 they resided or had a studio on Ipswich Street in Fenway Studios in Boston. They later purchased a house in Newton Center on Montvale Road.

Paxton&#x27;s wife managed his career 
and modeled for many of his works, like the painting in which she was dressed for the ball. &quot;William McGregor Paxton... benefited from an art-savvy wife who supported his career, using her energy in the bet that his offered the more secure future,&quot; said author and art historian Rena Tobey. The couple had no children.

==Career==
Paxton taught from 1906 to 1913 at the Museum of Fine Arts School and painted briefly at Fenway Studios in Boston. He worked at the Harcourt Street Studios in Boston and when it burned in 1904 he lost close to 100 paintings. He then went to the Fenway Studios for a brief period but then moved on to the Riverway Studios, also in Boston. He is primarily known for his portraits and painted both Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge. Maryhill Museum of Art says of his artistry, &quot;Paxton was well known for the attention he gave to the effects of light and detail in flesh and fabric. His works often present idealized views of women, such as this portrait (&quot;The Red Fan&quot;) of his wife Elizabeth&quot;, like Henry James&#x27;s portrayal of women in his novels &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881) or &quot;The American&quot; (1877). His models, often daughters and wives of his patrons, were depicted as refined, cultured women of &quot;conspicuous leisure&quot;, and equated with the &quot;precious aesthetic objects surround them&quot;, like the women of Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899) who reflect the wealth of their husbands or fathers. He crafted elaborate compositions with models in his studio, using props that appear in several paintings.

Paxton and several other Bostonian artists were inspired by Johannes Vermeer. The Metropolitan Museum of Art says of Paxton&#x27;s &quot;Tea Leaves&quot; (1909) in their collection:
Paxton employed a technique where only one area in his compositions was entirely in focus, while the rest was somewhat blurred, something he called &quot;binocular vision&quot; and credited to Vermeer. He began to employ this system in his own work, including &quot;The New Necklace&quot;, where only the gold beads are sharply defined while the rest of the objects in the composition have softer, blurrier edges.

Paxton is one of the key figures in the Boston School of painting and a co-founder of The Guild of Boston Artists with Frank Weston Benson and Edmund Charles Tarbell. As a member of the St. Botolph Club, Paxton played baseball with sculptor and friend Cyrus Dallin. Between 1926 and 1927, he was interviewed by Dewitt Lockman with 85 other artists and architects associated with the National Academy of Design. Records from the interview are held at the New York Historical Society and the Archives of American Art. Paxton was made a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1928.

Paxton died of a heart attack when he was painting his wife in their Montvale Road living room. He was 72 years of age. An exhibition was held in his memory at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from November 19 through December 14, 1941. His papers—including sketches, correspondence, and photographs—are held at the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="977489" wikidata="Q2352556" url="?curid=977489" title="M101 Group">
<text>The M101 Group is a loose group of galaxies located in the constellation Ursa Major. The group is named after the brightest galaxy in the group, the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Most of the other members of the group are companions of the Pinwheel Galaxy. The group itself is one of many located within the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).

==Members==

The table below lists galaxies that have been consistently identified as group members in the Nearby Galaxies Catalog, the survey of Fouque et al., the Lyons Groups of Galaxies (LGG) Catalog, and the three group lists created from the Nearby Optical Galaxy sample of Giuricin et al.


Other possible members galaxies (galaxies listed in only one or two of the lists from the above references) include the irregular galaxies NGC 5238 and UGC 8508.

==Nearby groups==

The M51 Group, which includes the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and the Sunflower Galaxy (M63), is located to the southeast of the M101 Group, and the NGC 5866 Group is located to the northwest. The distances to these three groups (as determined from the distances to the individual member galaxies) are similar, which suggests that the M51 Group, the M101 Group, and the NGC 5866 Group are actually part of a single large, loose, elongated group. However, most group identification methods (including those used by the references cited above) identify these three groups as separate entities.

<text>Rogaška Slatina (; ) is a town in eastern Slovenia. It is the largest settlement in, and the seat of, the Municipality of Rogaška Slatina. It is known for its curative mineral water, spa, and crystal glass.

==Name==
The name &quot;Rogaška Slatina&quot; literally means &#x27;Rogatec springs&#x27;, referring to a source of mineral water. The springs were dubbed &quot;Roitschocrene&quot; &#x27;Rogatec springs&#x27; (&lt; Greek κρήνη &quot;crene&quot; &#x27;spring&#x27;) in 1687 by Johann Benedikt Gründel. The settlement was known as &quot;Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn&quot; or &quot;Sauerbrunn Curort&quot; in German (and in older sources also &quot;Roitscher Sauerbrunn&quot;). Older sources also contain the Slovene names &quot;Slatina Zdravišče&quot; and &quot;Slatina Rogačka&quot;.

==History==

The Rogaška Slatina area was inhabited in antiquity, and a Roman road led to the settlement. A document from the Archbishopric of Salzburg dating from 1141 mentions a Roman stone next to a spring in the settlement. The 16th-century alchemist Leonhard Thurneysser was the first to describe the spring. The spring was also described by the imperial physician Paul de Sorbait in 1679, by the Carniolan physician Marko Gerbec circa 1700, and by Joseph Karl Kindermann in his 1798 history of Styria (&quot;Repertorium der steiermärkischen Geschichte, Geographie, Topographie, Statistik und Naturhistorie&quot;). The historian Rudolf Gustav Puff described Rogaška Slatina in a special publication, and 24 lithographs of the town were created by the artist Josip Reiterer in the early 19th century. The chemist Adolf Režek set up a small chemistry laboratory in Rogaška Slatina in 1931 and published various material about the town.

===World War II===
Between 1941 and 1945 Rogaška Slatina was occupied by Nazi Germany. The Wehrmacht&#x27;s 132nd infantry division entered into health-spa resort on April 11, 1941, only five days after invasion of Yugoslavia. In the following weeks, the occupier&#x27;s complex administration was set up, who transformed Rogaška Slatina because of its health and glassmaking importance, large accommodation capacity and position along the German-Croatian state border on the Sotla River into one of the key outposts of the Lower Styrian occupation zone. Daniel Siter in his thesis Rogaška Slatina during the period of German occupation (1941-1945) mentions the Croatian Nazi-collaborationists Ustashe (slov. Ustaši) 41 times, their presence during that time as well as their ravaging in the area well after WW2.

===Mass graves===
Rogaška Slatina is the site of two known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Sovinec Ravine Mass Grave () is located in the southeast part of the town, in a ravine above the railroad tracks. It contains the remains of 18 to 20 Croatians that were captured and then killed at the site in May and June 1945. The Flower Hill Mass Grave () lies east of the town and is believed to occupy the entire ravine below the former Triglav Hotel. It contains the remains of an unknown number of victims murdered after the war and/or victims murdered by the Nazis during the war.

==Spa==

Rogaška Slatina is a synonym for health-resort tourism in Slovenia. For centuries the curative mineral water rich in magnesium (branded as Donat Mg), the picturesque countryside, and other local attractions have attracted visitors to the area. Roman inscriptions referring to the spa waters have been found. A wooden fence was built around the spring in the 17th century, and the water flowed through a wooden trough. The castle lord Peter de Curti built an inn at the site in 1676 and charged people to visit the springs. At that time the water was also bottled in bottles produced by a nearby glass works.

==Churches==

The parish church in the town is dedicated to the Holy Cross and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. The current structure at the site was built between 1864 and 1866 in a Neo-Romanesque style. The earliest mention of a church at the site is in a manuscript from 1304, although the church predated that time. That building was Romanesque, and it was razed in 1863 to make way for today&#x27;s church.

Another church, next to the village of Prnek, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It also belongs to the Parish of Rogaška Slatina. It was built in the 17th century and contains a gold-plated altar dating to between 1650 and 1675. The rest of the internal furnishings are from the 18th and 19th centuries.

<doc id="977499" wikidata="Q2229880" url="?curid=977499" title="Broomstick lace">
<text>Broomstick lace, also known as jiffy lace and peacock eye crochet, is a historic crochet technique from the 19th century made using a crochet hook and another long slender item such as a knitting needle. Traditionally a broomstick was used, hence the name, but the modern variant is a lightweight plastic knitting needle or smooth wooden craft dowel. A larger knitting needle or dowel will result in a lacier effect, while a smaller will provide a more closely woven effect. The technique is used to make clothing, blankets, and other crocheted items. In most crochet techniques, each stitch is finished before beginning the next. Broomstick lace is different; like in knitting and Tunisian crochet, many stitches are left open for broomstick lace.

==History==
In Croatian folk costume in the 1800s and 1900s, needlework was often used to accent the sleeves of the (woman&#x27;s blouse). One such needlework technique was broomstick lace.

==Technique==
As with other forms of crochet the base of the pattern is a chain stitch. The number of stitches in this beginning chain are normally counted in multiples of 3 through 6, depending on the desired effect. The first row can either be immediately done in Broomstick lace, or instead incorporate a single or half-double crochet stitches. The &quot;broomstick&quot; or knitting needle is then used in the next row, as the crocheter pick up a loop through each of the stitches in row one and transfer it from the crochet hook onto the needle or dowel. This part of the process is similar to knitting as all stitches in the row are being picked up and held at one time on the knitting needle being used. Once a loop has been pulled up through every stitch, the loops are then worked back off the dowel by sliding them off in groupings of 3, 4, 5, or 6 loops (depending on the desired effect) at a time and working the same amount of single or half-double crochet stitches through the top of each group of loops at the same time.

The overall appearance of the work will vary based upon the number of loops in a group, the size of the knitting needle being used, as well as the type of yarn being used. Typical items made using this technique include afghans, baby blankets, scarves, shawls, and other items where an unusual lacy effect may be desired.

<text>Robert C. Solomon (September 14, 1942 – January 2, 2007) was a philosopher and business ethicist, notable author, and &quot;Distinguished Teaching Professor of Business and Philosophy&quot; at the University of Texas at Austin, where he held a named chair and taught for more than 30 years, authoring The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life (1976) and more than 45 other books and editions. Critical of the narrow focus of Anglo-American analytic philosophy, which he thought denied human nature and abdicated the important questions of life, he instead wrote analytically in response to the continental discourses of phenomenology and existentialism, on sex and love, on business ethics, and on other topics to which he brought an Aristotelian perspective on virtue ethics. He also wrote &quot;A Short History of Philosophy&quot; and others with his wife, Professor Kathleen Higgins.

Professor Solomon won many teaching honors, including the Standard Oil Outstanding Teaching Award in 1973; the University of Texas President&#x27;s Associates Teaching Award (twice); a Fulbright Lecture Award; University Research and National Endowment for the Humanities Grants; and the Chad Oliver Plan II Teaching Award in 1998.

His many works include &quot;About Love&quot;, &quot;Ethics and Excellence&quot;, &quot;A Better Way to Think about Business&quot;, &quot;The Joy of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Spirituality for the Skeptic&quot;, &quot;Not Passion&#x27;s Slave&quot;, and &quot;In Defense of Sentimentality&quot;.

==The passions: emotions and the meaning of life==
Solomon developed a cognitivist theory of the emotions as moral judgements about reality that inherently manifest a natural, pre-deliberative logic. As such, they are susceptible to rational appraisal and revision no less than our beliefs and propositions, and furthermore to strategic ethical reasoning. Emotions should not be suppressed or repressed by efforts at philosophic rationalism, which suffers a withering critique under his analysis, calling it &quot;emasculated&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;. It is our passions, according to R.Solomon, and &quot;not&quot; our reason, which are capable of demonstrating to us the meaning and purpose of life. Every emotion has a purpose or goal, even those that seem stupid or painful. Although the objects and strategies differ with each emotion, person, and relationship, the natural purpose of each is to maximize human dignity, the good for oneself and for humankind. Regarding the &quot;air of paradox surrounding an attempt by philosophy to deal with the passions&quot; and the &quot;certain irony that surrounds an attempt by philosophy to deal with the question of the meaning of life&quot;, Solomon asks, &quot;is not philosophy, itself, the problem?&quot;. Romeo&#x27;s conclusion constitutes his premise: &quot;Hang up philosophy! Unless philosophy can make a Juliet.&quot;

He derides modernist and contemporary theories of the mind and psyche influenced by materialism and scientism as having created a &quot;myth of the passions&quot;, which he explodes, exposing the vicissitudes of its &quot;hydraulic model&quot;.

==On sex, love, marriage, and children==
Solomon was particularly interested in the idea of love, arguing against the notion that romantic love is an inherent state of being, maintaining that it is instead a construct of Western culture, popularized and propagated in such a way that it has achieved the status of a universal in the eyes of many. Love for Solomon is not a universal, static quality, but an emotion, subject to the same vicissitudes as other emotions, like anger or sadness.
== On business ethics ==
His book &quot;Ethics and Excellence&quot; renewed in business ethics — philosophers and managers alike — an interest in Aristotelian virtue ethics, which he explained so that it could be applied to management development and leadership training. This caused the misunderstanding with some authors (Crane/Matten, &quot;Business Ethics: A European Perspective&quot;) that virtue ethics was a modern approach, unaware of the roots in Aristotle.

He also wrote about business ethics in &quot;Above the Bottom Line&quot;, &quot;It’s Good Business&quot;, &quot;Ethics and Excellence&quot;, &quot;New World of Business&quot; and &quot;A Better Way to Think about Business&quot;. He had designed and provided programs for corporations and organizations around the world and his books have been translated into more than a dozen languages.
==On History of Philosophy==
===Axial Period and Origins of Philosophy===

===To Anglo-American analytic philosophy===
The topic of the emotions was largely being ignored in Anglo-American analytic philosophy and social science, and also on the continent in the new scientism and structuralism when &quot;The Passions&quot; was written in 1976.

=== To phenomenology and existentialism ===
A significant portion of Solomon&#x27;s work focused on existentialism and phenomenology. He delved into the ideas of existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and phenomenologists like Martin Heidegger. His writings explored profound questions related to human existence, freedom, and personal responsibility.

==Personal life and career==
===Early life===
Solomon was born in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. His father was a lawyer, and his mother an artist. He was born with a hole in his heart and was not expected to live into adulthood. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in molecular biology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963 and his master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in philosophy and psychology from the University of Michigan in 1965 and 1967 respectively.

=== Teaching and research ===

He held visiting appointments at the University of Pennsylvania; the University of Auckland, New Zealand; Mount Holyoke College; Princeton University; the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Pittsburgh. From 1972 until his death, except for two years at the University of California at Riverside in the mid-1980s, he taught at University of Texas at Austin, serving as Quincy Lee Centennial Professor of Philosophy and Business. He was a member of the University of Texas Academy of Distinguished Teachers, which is devoted to providing leadership in improving the quality and depth of undergraduate instruction. Solomon was also a member of the inaugural class of Academic Advisors at the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics.

His interests were in 19th-century German philosophy—especially Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche—and 20th-century continental philosophy—especially Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Paul Sartre and phenomenology, as well as ethics and the philosophy of emotions. Solomon published more than 40 books on philosophy, and was also a published songwriter. He made a cameo appearance in Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Waking Life&quot; (2001), where he discussed the continuing relevance of existentialism in a postmodern world.

Solomon received numerous teaching awards at the University of Texas at Austin, and was a frequent lecturer in the highly regarded Plan II Honors Program. Solomon was known for his lectures on Søren Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre and other existentialist philosophers. Solomon described in one lecture a very personal experience he had while a medical student at the University of Michigan. He recounted how he stumbled as if by chance into a crowded lecture hall. He was rather unhappy in his medical studies at the time, and was perhaps seeking something different that day. He got precisely that. The professor, Frithjof Bergmann, was lecturing that day on something that Solomon had not yet been acquainted with. The professor spoke of how Nietzsche&#x27;s idea of the eternal return asks the fundamental question: &quot;If given the opportunity to live your life over and over again &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, forced to go through all of the pain and the grief of existence, would you be overcome with despair? Or would you fall to your knees in gratitude?&quot; After this lecture, Solomon quit medical school and began studies in philosophy.

He taught three courses as part of The Great Courses series: &quot;Will to Power: The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche&quot;, which he taught alongside his wife; &quot;No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life&quot;; and &quot;Passions: Philosophy and the Intelligence of Emotions.&quot;

=== Marriage, family, and legacy ===
He was married to Kathleen Higgins, with whom he co-authored several of his books. She is a professor of philosophy at University of Texas at Austin. Solomon collapsed and died of pulmonary hypertension on January 2, 2007, while changing planes at Zürich airport.

<text>The Penobscot Expedition was a 44-ship American naval armada during the Revolutionary War assembled by the Provincial Congress of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The flotilla of 19 warships and 25 support vessels sailed from Boston on July 19, 1779, for the upper Penobscot Bay in the District of Maine carrying an expeditionary force of more than 1,000 American colonial marines (not to be confused with the Continental Marines) and militiamen. Also included was a 100-man artillery detachment under the command of Lt. Colonel Paul Revere. 

The expedition&#x27;s goal was to reclaim control of mid-coast Maine from the British who had captured it a month earlier and renamed it New Ireland. It was the largest American naval expedition of the war. The fighting took place on land and at sea around the mouth of the Penobscot and Bagaduce rivers at Castine, Maine, over a period of three weeks in July and August. It resulted in the United States&#x27; worst naval defeat until Pearl Harbor 162 years later in 1941.

On June 17, British Army forces landed under the command of General Francis McLean and began to establish a series of fortifications around Fort George on the Majabigwaduce Peninsula in the upper Penobscot Bay, with the goals of establishing a military presence on that part of the coast and establishing the colony of New Ireland. In response, the Province of Massachusetts raised an expedition to drive them out, with some support from the Continental Congress. 

The Americans landed troops in late July and attempted to besiege Fort George in actions that were seriously hampered by disagreements over control of the expedition between land forces commander Brigadier General Solomon Lovell and expedition commander Commodore Dudley Saltonstall, who was later dismissed from the Navy for ineptitude. For almost three weeks, General McLean held off the assault until a British relief fleet arrived from New York on August 13 under the command of Sir George Collier, driving the American fleet to destruction up the Penobscot River. The survivors of the expedition made an overland journey back to more populated parts of Massachusetts with minimal food and arms.

==Background==

British war planners looked for ways to gain control over the New England colonies following the somewhat successful raid on Machias in 1777 and General John Burgoyne&#x27;s failed Saratoga campaign, but most of their effort was directed at another campaign against the southern colonies. Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord George Germain and his Under-Secretary William Knox were responsible for the war effort, and they wanted to establish a base on the coast of the District of Maine that could be used to protect Nova Scotia&#x27;s shipping and communities from American privateers and raiders. The British also hoped to keep open the timber supply of the Maine coast for masts and spars for the Royal Navy. The coast down to the Penobscot was also next to the Bay of Fundy, which was easily approached from the large British naval base at Halifax. Loyalist refugees in Castine had also proposed establishing a new colony or province to be called New Ireland as a precursor to New Brunswick. Sir Francis Bernard supported the idea of a new colony, as it would make &quot;a resort for the persecuted loyalists of New England&quot;.

John Nutting was a Loyalist who had piloted Sir George Collier&#x27;s expedition against Machias, and Knox induced him to write to Germain in January 1778 to promote the idea of a British military presence in Maine; he later dispatched him to London to do so in person. Nutting described the Castine peninsula as having a harbor that &quot;could hold the entire British Navy&quot; and was so easily defensible that &quot;1,000 men and two ships&quot; could protect it against any Continental force. He also proposed that the strategic location of such a post would help to carry the war to New England and would offer protection for Nova Scotia. Germain drafted orders for Lieutenant General Henry Clinton on September 2, to establish &quot;a province between the Penobscot and St. Croix rivers. Post to be taken on Penobscot River&quot;.

Germain ordered Clinton to &quot;send such a detachment of troops at Nova Scotia, or of the provincials under your immediate command, as you shall judge proper and sufficient to defend themselves against any attempt the rebels in those parts may be able to make during the winter to take post on Penobscot River, taking with them all necessary implements for erecting a fort, together with such ordnance and stores as may be proper for its defense, and a sufficient supply of provisions.&quot; However, Nutting&#x27;s ship was captured by an American privateer and he was forced to dump his dispatches, bringing an end to the idea of a new colony in 1778.

==British forces arrive==
Nutting reached New York in January 1779, but General Clinton had received copies of the orders from other messengers. Clinton had already assigned the expedition to General Francis McLean who was based in Halifax, and he sent Nutting there with Germain&#x27;s detailed instructions.

McLean&#x27;s expedition set sail from Halifax on May 30, and arrived in the Penobscot Bay on June 12. The next day, McLean and Captain Andrew Barkley, the commander of the naval convoy, identified a suitable site at which they could establish a post. On June 16, his forces began landing on a peninsula that was called Majabigwaduce (Castine, Maine) between the mouth of the Bagaduce River and a finger of the bay leading to the Penobscot River. The troops numbered approximately 700, consisting of 50 men of the Royal Artillery and Engineers, 450 of the 74th Regiment of (Highland) Foot, and 200 of the 82nd (Duke of Hamilton&#x27;s) Regiment. They began to build a fortification on the peninsula which jutted into the bay and commanded the principal passage into the inner harbor.

Fort George was established in the center of the small peninsula, with two batteries outside the fort to provide cover for , which was the only ship expected to stay in the area. A third battery was constructed on an island south of the bay near the mouth of the Bagaduce River, in which &quot;Albany&quot; was harbored. Construction of the works occupied the troops for the next month, until rumors came that an American expedition was being raised in Boston to oppose them, following which efforts were redoubled to prepare works suitable for defense against the Americans. Captain Henry Mowat of the &quot;Albany&quot; was familiar with Massachusetts politics, and he took the rumors quite seriously and convinced General McLean to leave additional ships that had been part of the initial convoy. Some of the convoy ships had already left, but the orders were countermanded before armed sloops &quot;North&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot; were able to leave.

==American reaction==
When news reached the American authorities at Boston, they hurriedly made plans to drive the British from the area. The Penobscot River was the gateway to lands controlled by the Penobscot Nation who generally favored the British, and Congress feared that they would lose any chance of enlisting the Penobscots as allies if a fort were successfully constructed at the mouth of the river. Massachusetts was also motivated by the fear of losing their claim over the territory in any post-war settlement.

To spearhead the expedition, Massachusetts petitioned Congress for the use of three Continental Navy warships: the 12-gun sloop &quot;Providence&quot;, 14-gun brig &quot;Diligent&quot;, and 32-gun frigate &quot;Warren&quot;. The rest of more than 40 vessels were made up of ships of the Massachusetts State Navy and private vessels under the command of Commodore Dudley Saltonstall. The Massachusetts authorities mobilized more than 1,000 militia, acquired six small field cannons, and placed Brigadier General Solomon Lovell in command of the land forces. The expedition departed from Boston harbor on July 19 and arrived off Penobscot on the afternoon of July 25.

==Landing==
On July 25, nine of the larger vessels in the American flotilla exchanged fire with the Royal Navy ships from 15:30 to 19:00. While this was going on, seven American boats approached the shore for a landing, but turned back when British fire killed a soldier in one of the boats.

On July 26, Lovell sent a force of Continental Marines to capture the British battery on Nautilus Island (also known as Banks Island), while the militia were to land at Bagaduce. The marines achieved their objective, but the militia turned back when British cannon overturned the leading boat, killing Major Daniel Littlefield and two of his men. Meanwhile, 750 men landed under Lovell&#x27;s command and began construction of siege works under constant fire. On July 27, the American artillery bombarded the British fleet for three hours, wounding four men aboard HMS &quot;Albany&quot;.

==Assault==
On July 28, under heavy covering fire from the &quot;Tyrannicide&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, and &quot;Sky Rocket&quot;, Brigadier General Peleg Wadsworth led an assault force of 400 (200 marines and 200 militia) ashore before dawn at Dyce&#x27;s Head on the western tip of the peninsula with orders to capture Fort George. They landed on the narrow beach and advanced up the steep bluff leading to the fort. The British pickets, who included Lieutenant John Moore, put up a determined resistance but received no reinforcement from the fort and were forced to retire, leaving the Americans in possession of the heights. Eight British troops were captured. At this point, Lovell ordered the attackers to halt and entrench where they were. Instead of assaulting the fort, Lovell had decided to build a battery within &quot;a hundred rods&quot; of the British lines and bombard them into surrender. The American casualties in the assault had been severe: &quot;one hundred out of four hundred men on the shore and bank&quot;, with the Continental Marines suffering more heavily than the militia. Commodore Saltonstall was so appalled by the losses incurred by his marines that he refused to land any more and even threatened to recall those already on shore. In addition his flagship, the Continental frigate &quot;Warren&quot;, suffered considerable damage during the engagement with hits to the warship&#x27;s mainmast, forestay and gammoning.

Although possessing significant naval superiority over the British, over the next two weeks the excessively cautious Saltonstall dawdled despite repeated requests by General Lovell that he attack Mowatt&#x27;s position at the entrance to the harbor. Instead he largely maneuvered the American fleet around the mouth of the Penobscot River beyond the range of the British guns with only occasional ineffective attempts to engage the British. As long as the British warships continued to hold the harbor they were able to pin down the American forces on the ground with concentrated fire and prevent them from taking Fort George.

Realizing that time was running out, on August 11 General Lovell again wrote to Saltonstall pleading for him to attack saying: &quot;I mean not to determine on your mode of attack; but it appears to me so very practicable, that any farther delay must be infamous; and I have it this moment by a deserter from one of their ships, that the moment you enter the harbour they will destroy them.&quot; Saltonstall&#x27;s ineptitude at Penobscot would lead to his being dismissed from the Navy as being &quot;ever after incompetent to hold a government office or state post&quot; the following October by the &quot;Committee for Enquiring into the Failure of the Penobscot Expedition&quot; of the Massachusetts General Court which determined that failure of the expedition was primarily the result of the &quot;want of proper Spirit and Energy on the part of the Commodore&quot;, that he &quot;discouraged any Enterprizes or offensive Measures on the part of our Fleet&quot;, and that the destruction of the fleet was occasioned &quot;principally by the Commodore&#x27;s not exerting himself at all at the time of the Retreat in opposing the Enemies&#x27; foremost Ships in pursuit&quot;.

==Siege==
On July 29, one American was killed. July 30, both sides cannonaded each other all day, and on July 31 two American sailors belonging to the &quot;Active&quot; were wounded by a shell. Lovell ordered a night assault on August 1 against the Half-Moon Battery next to Fort George, whose guns posed a danger to American shipping, and the Americans opened fire at 02:00. Colonel Samuel McCobb&#x27;s center column, comprising his own Lincoln County Regiment, broke and fled as soon as the British returned fire. The left column comprising Captain Thomas Carnes and a detachment of marines, and the right column comprising sailors from the fleet, kept going and stormed the battery. As dawn broke, the Fort&#x27;s guns opened up on the captured battery and a detachment of redcoats charged out and recaptured the Half-Moon, routing the Americans and taking 18 prisoners with them. Their own casualties were four men missing (who were killed), and 12 wounded.

The siege continued with minor skirmishing on August 2 with militiaman Wheeler Riggs of Falmouth being killed by an enemy cannon shot that bounced off a tree before hitting him. On August 4, Surgeon John Calef recorded in his journal that several men were wounded in exchanges of fire. On August 5, one man was killed and another captured, and on August 7, 100 Americans engaged 80 British with one killed and one wounded on the American side and two wounded among the British.

During this time, the British had been able to send word of their condition, and request reinforcements, and on August 3 Captain (later Vice Admiral) Sir George Collier led a fleet of ten warships out of New York.

The next day, Saltonstall launched a naval attack against the British fort, but Collier&#x27;s British relief fleet arrived and attacked the American ships. The privateer &quot;Hampden&quot; and one other vessel were captured by frigates and . Over the next two days, the American fleet fled upstream on the Penobscot River pursued by Collier. On August 13, an American officer was wounded by enemy fire. On August 14 and 16 all of the vessels were scuttled and burned by their own crews while the rest were destroyed at Bangor. Several transports were either captured or later salvaged by the British. The surviving crews then fled overland to Boston with almost no food or ammunition.

==Casualties==
Over the course of the siege, Colonel David Stewart claims the British garrison suffered 25 killed and 34 wounded. Stewart gives no figures for captured or missing, but 26 prisoners are known to have been taken by the Americans.

Apart from the 100 men killed and wounded during the assault of July 28, the known American casualties throughout the siege came to 12 killed, 16 wounded and one captured, in addition to &quot;several wounded&quot; on August 4. The &quot;History of Penobscot&quot; says that &quot;our whole loss of men was probably not less than 150&quot;. The chaotic retreat however, brought the American loss up to 474 killed, wounded, captured or missing.

==Aftermath==
A committee of inquiry blamed the American failure on poor coordination between land and sea forces and on Commodore Saltonstall&#x27;s failure to engage the British naval forces. On September 7, a Warrant for Court Martial was issued by the Navy Board, Eastern Department, against Saltonstall. Upon trial he was declared to be primarily responsible for the debacle, found guilty, and dismissed from military service. Paul Revere, who commanded the artillery in the expedition, was accused of disobedience and cowardice. This resulted in his dismissal from the militia, even though he was later cleared of the charges. Peleg Wadsworth, who mitigated the damage by organizing a retreat, was not charged in the court martial.

Historian George Buker suggests that Saltonstall may have been unfairly blamed for the defeat. Buker argues that Saltonstall was unfairly represented by Lovell and others, and that Saltonstall was a scapegoat for the campaign&#x27;s failure despite his tactically correct decisions given the geographic and military conditions in Penobscot Bay.

A year later the British Cabinet formally approved the New Ireland project on August 10, 1780, and King George III gave his assent the following day to the proposal to separate &quot;the country lying to the northeast of the Piscataway [Piscataqua] River&quot; from the province of Massachusetts Bay in order to establish &quot;so much of it as lies between the Sawkno [Saco] River and the St. Croix, which is the southeast boundary of Nova Scotia into a new province, which from its situation between the New England province and Nova Scotia, may with great propriety be called New Ireland&quot;. Pursuant to the terms of the 1783 Peace of Paris all British forces then evacuated Fort George (followed by some 600 Loyalists who removed from the area to St. Andrews on Passamaquoddy Bay) and abandoned their attempts to establish New Ireland. During the War of 1812, however, British forces again occupied Fort George (still calling the area New Ireland) from September 1814 to April 1815 and used it as a naval base before withdrawing again with the arrival of peace. Full ownership of present-day Maine (principally the northeastern borders with New Brunswick) remained disputed until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842. The &quot;District of Maine&quot; was a part of Massachusetts until 1820 when it was admitted into the Union as the 23rd state as part of the Missouri Compromise.

==Legacy==
In 1972 the Maine Maritime Academy and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology searched for and found the wreck of &quot;Defence&quot;, a privateer that was part of the American fleet. Evidence of scuttled ships was also found under the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge in Bangor and under the Bangor town dock, and several artifacts were recovered. Cannonballs were also reported to have been recovered during the construction of the concrete casements for the I-395 bridge in 1986.

The earthworks of Fort George stand at the mouth of the Penobscot River in Castine, accompanied by concrete work added later by the Americans in the 19th century. Archaeological evidence of the expedition, including cannonballs and cannon, was located during an archaeological project in 2000–2001.

Since 2004 a comprehensive exhibit on the Penobscot Expedition has been provided by the Castine Historical Society, located at its base on School Street, Castine.

In 2021, San Francisco Unified School District announced that it would strip Paul Revere&#x27;s name from Paul Revere K–8 for his role in the Penobscot Expedition. The San Francisco Board of Education mistakenly believed the expedition was to steal land from the Penobscot people. The renaming plan was later reversed in April 2021, and Paul Revere&#x27;s name was restored to that school.

== In popular culture ==
Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s 2010 historical novel &quot;The Fort&quot; gives an account of the expedition. It draws attention to the presence there of a junior British officer named John Moore, later a famous general.

<doc id="977502" wikidata="Q44558" url="?curid=977502" title="Underground City, Montreal">
<text>RÉSO, commonly referred to as the Underground City (), is the name applied to a series of interconnected office towers, hotels, shopping centres, residential and commercial complexes, convention halls, universities and performing arts venues that form the heart of Montreal&#x27;s central business district, colloquially referred to as Downtown Montreal. The name refers to the underground connections between the buildings that compose the network, in addition to the network&#x27;s complete integration with the city&#x27;s entirely underground rapid transit system, the Montreal Metro. Moreover, the first iteration of the Underground City was developed out of the open pit at the southern entrance to the Mount Royal Tunnel, where Place Ville Marie and Central Station stand today.
Though most of the connecting tunnels pass underground, many of the key passageways and principal access points are located at ground level, and there is also one skybridge (between Lucien-L&#x27;Allier Metro station and Gare Lucien L&#x27;Allier). In this regard, the Underground City is more of an indoor city (ville intérieure) than a truly subterranean city, although there are vast commercial sectors located entirely underground.

The network is particularly useful during Montreal&#x27;s long winters, during which time well over half a million people are estimated to use it every day. The network is largely climate controlled and well-lit, and is arranged in a U-shape with two principal north–south axes connected by an east–west axis. Combined, there are of tunnels over of the most densely populated part of Montreal. In total, there are more than 120 exterior access points to the network, not including the sixty or so Metro station entrances located outside the official limits of the RÉSO, some of which have their own smaller tunnel networks. Some of the city&#x27;s larger institutions, namely McGill University, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Concordia University, Université de Montréal and the Université du Québec à Montréal also have campus tunnel networks separate from the underground city.

==Overview==
In 2004, the downtown network of the underground city was re-branded and given the name RÉSO, which is a homophone of the French word &quot;réseau&quot;, or network. The &quot;O&quot; at the end of the word is the logo of the Montreal Metro. Schematic maps bearing the RÉSO logo are found throughout the network. The largest and best-known segment is located in the centre of downtown, delimited by the Peel and Place-des-Arts Metro stations on the Green Line and the Lucien-L&#x27;Allier and Place-d&#x27;Armes stations on the Orange Line.

The underground city is promoted as an important tourist attraction by most Montreal travel guidebooks, and as an urban planning achievement it is impressive. For most Montrealers, however, it tends to be considered more as a large mall complex linking Metro stations—they may not even know they are in it. Many Canadian cities have some kind of tunnel or skywalk system downtown to help people avoid the weather. Most parts of the Montreal underground city are open while the Metro is in operation (5:30 AM to 1:00 AM), though some are closed outside of business hours. Maps of the underground city and the Metro can be obtained free of charge from all Metro stations, and the network of buildings is indicated on most maps of the downtown core.

Nearly 500,000 people use it per day. It is also the largest underground complex in the world. It stretches for 32 kilometers (20 miles) and covers 4 million square meters (one and a half square miles). According to official statistics, its corridors link up with 10 metro stations, 2 bus terminals, 1,200 offices, about 2,000 stores including 2 major department stores, approximately 1,600 housing units, 200 restaurants, 40 banks, movie theatres providing 40 screens and other entertainment venues, 7 major hotels, 4 universities, Place des Arts, a cathedral, the Bell Centre (home of the Montreal Canadiens), and 3 exhibition halls: the Place Bonaventure, the Convention Centre (Palais des Congrès de Montréal) and the Olympic Centre.

==History of the central segment==
The vision for the underground city was originally that of urbanist Vincent Ponte, for whom a commemorative plaque was unveiled in November 2006 at Place Ville Marie. The first link of the underground city arose with the construction of the Place Ville Marie office tower and underground shopping mall, opened in 1962 and built to cover an unsightly pit of railway tracks north of the Central Station. Two tunnels linked it to Central Station and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.

The advent of the Montreal Metro in 1966, in time for Expo 67, brought tunnels joining Bonaventure station to the Château Champlain hotel, the Place du Canada office tower, Place Bonaventure, Central Station, and Windsor Station, forming the core of the Underground City. Square-Victoria-OACI station connected to the Tour de la Bourse, Montreal&#x27;s stock exchange building.

Adding to the development of the underground city was the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission&#x27;s policy of offering the aerial rights above Metro station entrances for construction through emphyteutic leases, an advantageous way to acquire prime real estate. When the Metro began running in 1966, ten buildings were already connected directly to Metro stations; development would continue until only three free-standing station entrances (Square-Victoria-OACI, St-Laurent and Place-des-Arts) remained in the central segment.

In 1974, the Complexe Desjardins office tower complex was constructed, spurring the construction of a &quot;second downtown&quot; underground city segment between Place-des-Arts and Place-d&#x27;Armes station, via Place des Arts, Complexe Desjardins, the Complexe Guy Favreau federal government building, and the Palais des Congrès (convention centre).

Between 1984 and 1992, the underground city expanded, with the construction of three major linked shopping centres in the Peel and McGill Metro station areas: Cours Mont-Royal, Place Montréal-Trust, and the Promenades Cathédrale (built underneath Christ Church Cathedral). McGill station was already linked with The Bay, Eaton&#x27;s (now the Complexe Les Ailes), Centre Eaton, and two other office/mall complexes. Between 1984 and 1989, the underground city grew from of passages to almost .

Mega-projects added to the size of the network throughout the 1990s, including Le 1000 De La Gauchetière (the tallest building in Montreal), Le 1250 René-Lévesque, and the Montreal World Trade Centre. Although these buildings have only a secondary commercial sector, they use their connection to the underground city as a selling point for their office space. Also, the construction of a tunnel between Eaton Centre and Place Ville-Marie consolidated the two central halves of the underground city. The construction of the Bell (originally Molson) Centre connected Lucien-L&#x27;Allier Metro station to the underground city, as well as replacing Windsor Station with the new Gare Lucien-L&#x27;Allier commuter train station.

Most recently, in 2003, the complete redevelopment of the Quartier international de Montréal consolidated several segments of the central underground city with continuous pedestrian corridors. The construction of the ICAO headquarters joined Place Bonaventure to Square-Victoria-OACI station, which in turn was joined to the Palais des Congrès and Place-d&#x27;Armes station via the new Caisse de dépôt et de placement building and a tunnel under Place Jean-Paul Riopelle. Uniquely, the new tunnel sections in the Quartier International contain educational and artistic displays sponsored by major Montreal museums. As a result of this construction, one can now walk all the way across the centre of downtown, from the UQAM Sherbrooke Pavilion at the corner of Sainte Famille Street and Sherbrooke Street to the Lucien-L&#x27;Allier Metro station just south-west of the Bell Centre, without going outside—a span of as the crow flies, or approximately walking distance.

===Structural concerns, 2007 closure===

On Friday, August 24, 2007, construction crews discovered a seven-meter (23 foot) long fissure in the ceiling of an underground corridor linking the McGill station to The Bay store located under de Maisonneuve Boulevard, between Aylmer Street and Union Avenue. The station, the Underground City shops, and above ground streets and buildings were closed to assess whether there was any risk of collapse of the structure. Service on the Métro Green Line was halted between Berri-UQAM and Lionel-Groulx stations until Sunday evening. According to a spokesperson for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, city workers may have caused the damage by hitting a nearby pillar.

During the weekend, city workcrews worked non-stop to shore up the sagging slab of concrete, installing more than 1,000 temporary metal supports.

On Monday, August 27, 2007, service was restored to the Green Line, and all streets but the block of de Maisonneuve boulevard between Union and Aylmer were reopened to traffic. The one block that was not open to traffic was open to pedestrians. All buildings reopened, including The Bay. Officials said that it would take months to fix the problem. While inspecting the site, it was discovered that 2021 Union, the Parkade Montreal building, was in danger of having concrete side panels fall off. City engineers performed emergency repairs. A report later blamed the construction of a bike path for the damage. Street traffic on De Maisonneuve resumed in March 2008.

==Central segment==
The central segment interconnects the following seven Metro stations via indoor walkway. As the Berri-UQAM station, which allows transfers between the Green, Orange and Yellow lines, is two Metro stops from the closest station in this segment, in many cases it is quicker to walk than to take the Metro. The lists of connected facilities which follow are grouped by segment and nearest Metro station.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Derek Anthony Seagrim VC (24 September 1903 – 6 April 1943) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His VC was earned during the North Africa Campaign.

His brother was Hugh Seagrim GC. He and his brother have the distinction of being the only siblings awarded the Victoria Cross and George Cross, both posthumously.

==Life==
Born in Bournemouth, Hampshire (now Dorset) on 24 September 1903, Derek was the third of five sons, one of his younger brothers was Hugh Seagrim GC, giving these two brothers the distinction of being the only siblings to receive the Victoria Cross and George Cross. His father was the Reverend Charles Seagrim, rector of Whissonsett in Norfolk and he was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, and at Norwich School, where his younger brother Hugh also attended later.

He received his commission into the Green Howards in 1923 and served in Jamaica, Palestine and China. He completed a three-year tour with the King&#x27;s African Rifles in East Africa and, in 1939, returned to the 1st Battalion, Green Howards in Palestine as Intelligence Officer. At the outbreak of World War II, he was an Air Liaison Officer in East Africa before working on the staff for the Greek Campaign between 1941–42. He was given command of the 7th Battalion, Green Howards at El Alamein in October 1942. The battalion was part of the 69th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division.

When he was 39 years old, Derek Seagrim was made a temporary lieutenant colonel in the 7th Battalion, The Green Howards (Alexandra Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Regiment).

On 20/21 March 1943 at the Mareth Line, Tunisia, Lieutenant Colonel Seagrim&#x27;s courage and leadership led directly to the capture of an important objective. When it appeared that the attack on the position would fail owing to the intensity of enemy fire, he placed himself at the head of his battalion and led them forward. He personally helped to place a scaling ladder over an anti-tank ditch and was the first across. Leading an attack on two machine-gun posts, he accounted for 20 of the enemy and when a counter-attack was launched next day he moved from post to post quite unperturbed, until it was defeated.

He died at a military hospital near Sfax on 6 April 1943 after being severely wounded at the Battle of Wadi Akarit. He is buried in Sfax War Cemetery, Tunisia, Plot XIV Row C Grave 21.

Derek Anthony Seagrim&#x27;s medals are on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>SilverFin is the first novel in the Young Bond series that depicts Ian Fleming&#x27;s superspy James Bond as a teenager in the 1930s. It was written by Charlie Higson and released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2005, by Puffin Books in conjunction with a large marketing campaign; a Canadian release of the same edition occurred in late March. The United States edition, which was slightly edited for content, was released on April 27, 2005, by Miramax Books.

&quot;SilverFin&quot;″s success spawned a mobile game published by PlayerOne on January 5, 2006, in conjunction with the release of the second novel in the Young Bond series, &quot;Blood Fever&quot;. The game features three locations, 15 levels, and a variety of enemies that the player must avoid.

Because Fleming never explicitly said when James Bond was born, Ian Fleming Publications and Charlie Higson chose the year 1920 as his birth year. &quot;SilverFin&quot; takes place in 1933.

==Plot summary==
&quot;SilverFin&quot; is broken up into three parts in addition to a prologue. In the prologue, an unnamed school boy is attacked by eels, attracted to a bleeding fishhook cut, while fishing in Loch Silverfin. Then from nowhere a mysterious eel-like man runs and jumps into the loch and tries to save him.

The first part of the book chronicles James Bond&#x27;s starting attendance at Eton College, an elite English boarding school. There he meets Pritpal, the son of an Indian Maharajah. The two become good friends and live together in the dorms along with another of his friends, a Chinese boy named Tommy Chong. Bond also comes into contact with George Hellebore, an American bully three years older than James. George&#x27;s father, Lord Randolph Hellebore is an armament dealer who sold weapons to various countries after World War I. It is later revealed that Lord Hellebore knew Bond&#x27;s father, Andrew Bond, who also sold arms while working for Vickers after the war. Lord Hellebore arrives at Eton to direct and host a tournament cup (&quot;Hellebore Cup&quot;) for the boys. The competition is divided into three events: shooting, swimming, and running, It is rumoured that George Hellebore is supposed to win, but an unexpected rival named Andrew Carlton manages to beat him. Bond places seventh in shooting, fourth in his heat in swimming (which was not good enough to qualify for the final race), and first in cross country running. During the running sequence Lord Hellebore attempts to help his son cheat so that he could win the tournament; however, Bond after seeing George take a shortcut a first time decides to follow George the next time, and being the superior runner then passes him to win the race. George tries to trip James with his leg but loses his balance and falls into a mud puddle. Because Bond won first in running, Andrew Carlton is the winner and George Hellebore came in third place in the cup overall, which was unacceptable by his father&#x27;s standard.

The second part of the novel details the spring break. James travels to Scotland to meet with his Aunt Charmian who is visiting Bond&#x27;s ailing uncle, Max, who is dying of cancer. Both Charmian and Max are siblings of Bond&#x27;s father, Andrew. It is also in this part of the novel that Higson reveals the details of Bond&#x27;s parents&#x27; death, first mentioned in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. While travelling to Scotland, Bond befriends an older boy named &quot;Red&quot; (for his bright red hair) Kelly who is travelling to the same place in search for his missing cousin, Alfie who disappeared whilst out fishing (thus tying in with the prologue). James also meets a girl called Wilder who loves riding horses. While staying at his uncle&#x27;s place Bond learns how to drive his uncle&#x27;s car and finds out that his uncle was a spy during World War I. Bond also learns that Lord Randolph Hellebore owns a large stretch of land nearby that includes Loch Silverfin. He later meets back up with Red and ventures to Hellebore&#x27;s estate where the two encounter Mike &quot;Meatpacker&quot; Moran, a Pinkerton&#x27;s detective from New York City sent to investigate Lord Randolph Hellebore at the behest of Hellebore&#x27;s wife, who suspects Lord Randolph of having killed his brother, her lover, Algar. However, they later discover the detective dead and eaten in Loch Silverfin, which is full of eels.

The boys plan to infiltrate the castle by climbing a tree, but Red falls out of the tree and breaks his leg, and is unable to continue. James succeeds in entering the castle. After snooping around he bumps his head and is captured. When James regains consciousness he is tied to a table and Lord Hellebore begins to interrogate him. Hellebore explains to James that he and his brother set out to create better and stronger soldiers by manipulating the endocrine system. Because it is difficult to find humans to test on, Algar tested the first &quot;SilverFin serum&quot; on himself. Initially it worked, but later an increased dosage transformed Algar physically, giving him a distorted body that is eel-like. Lord Hellebore subsequently perfected the serum and was able to turn it into a pill. The pill essentially acts as a steroid making anyone who uses it more agile, stronger, etc. for a temporary set of time. Hellebore even tests this pill on his own son (as James had witnessed during the cross-country race). Lord Hellebore reveals that he tested the SilverFin serum on Alfie Kelly, the boy whom Bond is searching for, but Kelly&#x27;s heart gave out and he died. The wastes poured into Loch Silverfin made the eels vicious. Later Bond is also drugged with the SilverFin serum and locked in a cell. Bond, however, uses his enhanced abilities to escape the cell and the estate by finding an underwater entrance to Loch Silverfin and swimming through, with the help of Wilder Lawless (who kisses him at some point), only to return shortly later with George Hellebore as an ally to destroy Lord Randolph&#x27;s lab. George has increasingly become upset with his dreadful father and his work, and secretly wishes to be with his mother more than anything. The two destroy the lab and are later confronted by Lord Hellebore who intends to kill them both. Hellebore attacks them with a double-barreled shotgun. However, Algar intervenes at the last moment and forces himself and Hellebore into Loch Silverfin. Algar is wounded by his brother&#x27;s shotgun and his blood attracts the eels who kill both the brothers while they are fighting.

James collapses due to a lung infection and exhaustion shortly after and for ten days lies unconscious. When he regains consciousness he learns that George has moved back to America to be with his mother, and that his Uncle Max has died, leaving James his car.

===Connections to Bond canon===
* &quot;SilverFin&quot; begins with a similar opening to Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.
** Fleming: &quot;The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning.&quot;
** Higson: &quot;The smell and noise and confusion of a hallway full of schoolboys can be quite awful at twenty past seven in the morning.&quot;
* Bond&#x27;s Aunt Charmian drives an identical Bentley to one Bond drives in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and in subsequent books. Bond also inherits his uncle&#x27;s 1.5 liter Bamford &amp; Martin Sidevalve Short Chassis Tourer. Bamford &amp; Martin later became Aston Martin.
* During a scene at a circus the announcer presents &quot;The Mighty Donovan&quot;. &quot;The Mighty O&#x27;Donovan&quot; is Donovan &quot;Red&quot; Grant&#x27;s father, referenced in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;.
* Lord Hellebore tells his son while they are hunting that they are a lot like Indians, and, when his son kills a deer, he says he is a true Indian. This is a reference to Ian Fleming&#x27;s World War II days, where his soldiers were nicknamed &#x27;Fleming&#x27;s Indians&#x27;. References to American Indians also appear in the novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, where Le Chiffre calls Bond a boy playing Indians, and on the last page, where Bond scolds himself for carelessly playing Indians while his enemies had been working right next to him.

* Higson&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Out of Breath,&quot; but it was felt this sounded too much like an Elmore Leonard novel. Several permutations on &quot;Silver&quot; were tried, including &quot;SilverBack&quot;, &quot;SilverSkin&quot;, &quot;SilverHead&quot;, and &quot;SilverFist&quot;, before settling on &quot;SilverFin&quot;.
* A hellebore is a poisonous plant often thought to resemble a rose, making a suitable name for the handsome but evil Lord Hellebore.

===International editions===
* When released in Germany in August 2005, &quot;SilverFin&quot; was retitled &quot;Silent Waters Are Deadly&quot;.
* The U.S. edition of the book was edited to remove descriptions that were considered too racy for young readers. One such example includes a description of Wilder Lawless&#x27;s legs during a tussle between herself and Bond.

<doc id="977510" wikidata="Q6371534" url="?curid=977510" title="Karl Albert Buehr">
<text>Karl Albert Buehr (1866–1952) was a painter born in Germany.

Buehr was born in Feuerbach - near Stuttgart. He was the son of Frederick Buehr and Henrietta Doh (Dohna?). He moved to Chicago with his parents and siblings in the 1880s. In Chicago, young Karl worked at various jobs until he was employed by a lithograph company near the Art Institute of Chicago. Introduced to art at work, Karl paid regular visits to the Art Institute, where he found part-time employment, enabling him to enroll in night classes. Later, working at the Institute as a night watchman, he had a unique opportunity to study the masters and actually posted sketchings that blended in favorably with student&#x27;s work. Having studied under John H. Vanderpoel, Buehr graduated with honors, while his work aroused such admiration that he was offered a teaching post there, which he maintained for many years thereafter. He graduated from the Art Inst. of Chicago and served in the IL Cav in the Spanish–American War. Mary Hess became Karl&#x27;s wife—she was a student of his and an accomplished artist in her own right. In 1922, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member.

==Art Studies in Europe==
In 1904, Buehr received a bronze medal at the St. Louis Universal Exposition, then, in 1905, Buehr and his family moved to France, thanks to a wealthy Chicago patron, and they spent the following year in Taormina, Sicily, where the artist painted local subjects, executing both genre subjects and landscapes as well as time in Venice. Buehr spent at least some time in Paris, where he worked with Raphaël Collin at the Académie Julian.

==Giverny and American Impressionism==
Prior to this time, Buehr had developed a quasi-impressionistic style, but after 1909, when he began spending summers near Monet in Giverny, his work became decidedly characteristic of that plein-air style but he began focusing on female subjects posed out-of-doors. He remained for some time in Giverny, and here he became well-acquainted with other well known expatriate America impressionists such as Richard Miller, Theodore Earl Butler, Frederick Frieseke, and Lawton Parker. It seems likely that Buehr met Monet, since his own daughter Kathleen and Monet&#x27;s granddaughter, Lili Butler, were playmates, according to George Buehr, the painter&#x27;s son. His other daughter Lydia died before adulthood due to diabetes. He returned to Chicago at the onset of World War I and taught at The Art Inst for many years. One of his noted pupils at the Art Institute was Archibald Motley, Jr. the famous African American &quot;Harlem&quot; Renaissance painters. Motley credits Buehr with being one of his finest teachers and one who encouraged his style.

==Teaching Career in Chicago==
Buehr remained an expressive colorist, but broadened his brushwork somewhat in later years when impressionism waned. Back in America, he was immediately successful. He won a silver medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco and the Purchase Prize of the Chicago Municipal Art Commission in the following year. So famed was Buehr that had a one-man exhibition at the Century of Progress Fair in Chicago in 1934.

After a long and exceedingly productive career, Karl Buehr died in Chicago at the age of eighty-six.

==Walter Buehr==
His nephew Walter Buehr was the author and illustrator of many children&#x27;s books. Walter Franklin Buehr May 14, 1897 - January 2, 1971
Walter Buehr was born in Chicago on May 14, 1897. After high school he attended several different art schools including the Art Students League of New York (where he later taught), the Detroit School of Design, the Philadelphia School of Industrial Arts, the Art Students League, and he also studied art in Europe.
He began a first sergeant in the first camouflage section of the U.S. Army Engineers during World War I and was awarded the active service medal.
He married Camilla Goodwyn, a portrait artist and fashion illustrator, in 1938. The two had three daughters, and at least five grandchildren. Two of his grandchildren lived in France &amp; couldn&#x27;t speak English, which made it very hard on a grandfather who spoke very little French!
Buehr had varied talents and interests. He designed furniture, was interested in ceramics, like to tinker with high fidelity systems, and loved sailing. He even lived on his boat during the summers and cruised both the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean. This hobby led to the writing of his first book - Ships and Life Afloat. He wanted children in the Midwest to be able to understand the terms used in stories about the sea, how the ships were rigged, how they operated, what the life of a sailor was like, etc.
His over fifty-six books, including four for adults, reflect his wide variety of interests, including sailing and the sea, medieval history, exploration, transportation, electricity, and more. His history books dealt with romantic eras full of knights, castles, galleys, and galleons. (This should be moved to its own entry if he is notable enough.)

===Allied Air Forces===
At the time of Operation Husky, the Allied air forces - the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces - in the North African and Mediterranean theatre were organized as the Mediterranean Air Command (MAC) under the command of Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder (RAF). The major subdivisions of the MAC included the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) under the command of Lt. General Carl Spaatz (USAAF) with Air Vice Marshal James Robb as his deputy, the American 12th Air Force (also commanded by Gen. Spaatz), the American 9th Air Force under the command of Lt. General Lewis H. Brereton, and units of the British Royal Air Force (RAF).

Also supporting the NAAF were the RAF Middle East Command, Air Headquarters Malta, RAF Gibraltar, and the No. 216 (Transfer and Ferry) Group, which were subdivisions of MAC under the command of Tedder. He reported to the Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower for the NAAF operations, but to the British Chiefs of Staff for RAF Command operations. Air Headquarters Malta, under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Sir Keith Park, also supported Operation Husky.

The &quot;Desert Air Task Force&quot; consisting of North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers (the 12th and 340th Bombardment Groups) and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters (the 57th, 79th, and 324th Fighter Groups) from the 9th Air Force served under the command of Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham of the Northwest African Tactical Air Force. These bomber and fighter groups moved to new airfields on Sicily as soon as a significant beachhead had been captured there.

In the MAC organization established at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the 9th Air Force was assigned as a subdivision of the RAF Middle East Command under the command of Air Chief Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas.

The 29th Infantry Division &quot;Piemonte&quot; was one of three infantry divisions, which recruited in Sicily. It mainly drafted men from eastern Sicily and had its peacetime headquarters in Messina. It&#x27;s two infantry regiments were based in Messina (3rd) and Catania (4th), with the division&#x27;s artillery regiment based also in Messina. In September 1940 the division was transferred to Albania and remained in the Balkans and Greece until it disbanded after the Italian-Allied Armistice of Cassibile.

==== Maritime Military Command Sicily ====
Military harbors in Sicily were under command of the Royal Italian Navy&#x27;s Maritime Military Command Sicily () in Messina, which fell under Armed Forces Command Sicily. The command&#x27;s commanding officer was Ammiraglio di Squadra Pietro Barone and a large majority of its units were Royal Italian Army and CC.NN. units. The only naval units in Sicily in July 1943 were twenty torpedo boats of the 3rd and 7th torpedo boat squadrons.

===== Armored Trains =====
The Royal Italian Navy fielded 14 armored trains, which were equipped with naval guns that had been removed from decommissioned ships. Ten of the trains were assigned to the Armed Forces Command Sicily before the allied landings, with eight trains being transferred to Sicily and two based on the Italian mainland near Reggio Calabria to provide fire for the defense of the Strait of Messina. The ten trains of the Armed Forces Command Sicily on 10 July 1943 were:

* Type 1 Operational Train (4x 120/45 Mod. 1918 naval guns, 4x 20/77 anti-aircraft guns)
** Armored Train 120/1/S, in Siderno (attached to the 211th Coastal Division in Calabria)
** Armored Train 120/3/S, in Porto Empedocle (attached to the 207th Coastal Division)
** Armored Train 120/4/S, in Catania (attached to the 213th Coastal Division)

** Armored Train 152/1/T, in Termini Imerese (attached to the 208th Coastal Division)

** Armored Train 102/1/T, in Syracuse (attached to the 206th Coastal Division)

The ten armored trains did not take part in any combat operation after the allied landings in Sicily, as the allies&#x27; absolute air supremacy prevent the trains from leaving their camouflaged shelters. The eight trains based in Sicily were blown up by their crews during the retreat from the island.

==== Air Force Command Sicily ====
Airfields in Sicily were under command of the Royal Italian Air Force&#x27;s Air Force Command Sicily, which fell under Armed Forces Command Sicily. The commanding officer was Generale di divisione aerea Adriano Monti.

The Territorial Anti-aircraft Defense ( - MDICAT) was an organization of the Italian National Fascist Party&#x27;s Voluntary Militia for National Security tasked with static air-defense of cities and installations. The MDICAT was organized in 22 legions, which commanded all ground-based air-defense units, including Royal Italian Army and Royal Italian Navy units, in their sector. The territorial anti-aircraft defense unit responsible for Sicily was the 22nd Territorial CC.NN. Anti-aircraft Legion. The list below gives an overview of the 22nd Legion&#x27;s batteries sorted by cities with the respective services army (RA), navy (RN), and militia (CC.NN.) listed.

<text>A rocket-powered aircraft or rocket plane is an aircraft that uses a rocket engine for propulsion, sometimes in addition to airbreathing jet engines. Rocket planes can achieve much higher speeds than similarly sized jet aircraft, but typically for at most a few minutes of powered operation, followed by a gliding flight. Unhindered by the need for oxygen from the atmosphere, they are suitable for very high-altitude flight. They are also capable of delivering much higher acceleration and shorter takeoffs. Many rocket aircraft may be drop launched from transport planes, as take-off from ground may leave them with insufficient time to reach high altitudes.

Rockets have been used simply to assist the main propulsion in the form of jet assisted take off (JATO) also known as rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO or RATOG). Not all rocket planes are of the conventional takeoff like &quot;normal&quot; aircraft. Some types have been air-launched from another plane, while other types have taken off vertically – nose in the air and tail to the ground (&quot;tail-sitters&quot;).

Because of the use of heavy propellants and other practical difficulties of operating rockets, the majority of rocket planes have been built for experimental or research use, as interceptor fighters and space aircraft.

==History==
===Background===

Peruvian polymath Pedro Paulet conceptualized the Avión Torpedo in 1902 – a liquid-propellant rocket-powered aircraft that featured a canopy fixed to a delta tiltwing – spending decades seeking donors for the aircraft while serving as a diplomat in Europe and Latin America. Paulet&#x27;s concept of using liquid-propellant was decades ahead of rocket engineers at the time who utilized black powder as a propellant. Reports of Paulet&#x27;s rocket aircraft concept first appeared in 1927 after Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean in an aircraft. Paulet publicly criticized Austrian rocket pioneer Max Valier&#x27;s proposal about a rocket-powered aircraft completing the journey faster using black powder, arguing that his liquid-propellant rocket aircraft from thirty years earlier would be a better option.

Paulet would go on to visit the German rocket association Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR) and on March 15, 1928, Valier applauded Paulet&#x27;s liquid-propelled rocket design in the VfR publication &quot;Die Rakete&quot;, saying the engine had &quot;amazing power&quot;. In May 1928, Paulet was present to observe the demonstration of a rocket car of the Opel RAK program of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, and after meeting with the German rocket enthusiasts. VfR members began to view black powder as a hindrance for rocket propulsion, with Valier himself believing that Paulet&#x27;s engine was necessary for future rocket development. Paulet would soon be approached by Nazi Germany to help develop rocket technology, though he refused to assist and never shared the formula for his propellant. The Nazi government would then appropriate Paulet&#x27;s work while a Soviet spy in the VfR, Alexander Boris Scherchevsky, possibly shared plans with the Soviet Union.
On 11 June 1928, as part of the Opel RAK program of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, Lippisch Ente became the first aircraft to fly under rocket power. During the following year, the Opel RAK.1 became the first purpose-built rocket plane to fly with Fritz von Opel himself as the pilot. The Opel RAK.1 flight is also considered the world&#x27;s first public flight of a manned rocket plane since it took place before a large crowd and with world media in attendance.

On 28 June 1931, another ground-breaking rocket flight was conducted by the Italian aviator and inventor Ettore Cattaneo, who created another privately built rocket plane. It flew and landed without particular problems. Following this flight, the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III appointed Cattaneo count of Taliedo; due to his pioneering role in rocket flight, his likeness is displayed in the Space Museum of Saint Petersburg as well as in the Museum of Science and Tech of Milan.

===World War II===
The Heinkel He 176 was the world&#x27;s first aircraft to be propelled solely by a liquid-propellant rocket engine. It performed its first powered flight on 20 June 1939 with Erich Warsitz at the controls. The He 176, while demonstrated to the Reich Air Ministry did not attract much official support, leading to Heinkel abandoning its rocket propulsion endeavours; the sole aircraft was briefly displayed at the Berlin Air Museum and was destroyed by an Allied bombing raid in 1943.

The first rocket plane ever to be mass-produced was the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet interceptor, introduced by Germany towards the final years of the conflict as one of several efforts to develop effective rocket-powered aircraft. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s first dedicated Me 163 fighter wing, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 400 (JG 400) was established in 1944, and was principally tasked with providing additional protection for the manufacturing plants producing synthetic gasoline, which were prominent targets for Allied air raids. It was planned to station further defensive units of rocket fighters around Berlin, the Ruhr and the German Bight.

A typical Me 163 tactic was to fly vertically upward through the bombers at , climb to , then dive through the formation again, firing as they went. This approach afforded the pilot two brief chances to fire a few rounds from his cannons before gliding back to his airfield. It was often difficult to supply the needed fuel for operating the rocket motors. In the final days of the Third Reich, the Me 163 was withdrawn in favor of the more successful Messerschmitt Me 262, which used jet propulsion instead.

Other German rocket-powered aircraft were pursued as well, including the Bachem Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot;, a vertical takeoff manned rocket interceptor aircraft that flew in prototype form. Further projects never even reached the prototype stage, such as the Zeppelin Rammer, the &quot;Fliegende Panzerfaust&quot; and the Focke-Wulf &quot;Volksjäger&quot;. Having a much larger size than any other rocket-powered endeavor of the conflict, the Silbervogel antipodal bomber spaceplane was planned by the Germans, however, later calculations showed that design would not have worked, instead being destroyed during reentry. The Me 163 Komet is the only type of rocket-powered fighter to see combat in history, and one of only two types of rocket-powered aircraft seeing any combat.
Japan, who was allied to Nazi Germany, secured the design schematics of the Me 163 Komet. After considerable effort, it successfully established its own production capability, which was used to produce a limited number of its own copies, known as the Mitsubishi J8M, which performed its first powered flight on 7 July 1945. Furthermore, Japan attempted to develop its own domestically designed rocket-powered interceptor, the Mizuno Shinryu; neither the J8M or the Shinryu ever saw combat. The Japanese also produced approximately 850 Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka rocket-powered suicide attack aircraft during the Second World War, a number were deployed in the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar analysis concluded that the &quot;Ohka&quot;″s impact was negligible, and that no U.S. Navy capital ships had been hit during the attacks due to the effective defensive tactics that were employed.

Other experimental aircraft included the Soviet Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 that flew in 1942 while the Northrop XP-79 was originally planned with rocket engines but switched to jet engines for its first and only flight in 1945. A rocket-assisted P-51D Mustang was developed by North American Aviation that could attain . The engine ran on fumaric acid and aniline which was stored in two under wing drop tanks. The plane was tested in flight in April 1945. The rocket engine could run for about a minute. Similarly, the Messerschmitt Me 262 &quot;Heimatschützer&quot; series used a combination of rocket and jet propulsion to allow for shorter take-offs, faster climb rate, and even greater speeds.

===Cold War era===
During 1946, the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270 was constructed in response to a Soviet Air Forces requirement issued during the previous year for a rocket-powered interceptor aircraft in the point-defence role. The design of the I-270 incorporated several pieces of technology that had been developed by Sergei Korolev between 1932 and 1943.

During 1947, a key milestone in aviation history was reached by the rocket-powered Bell X-1, which became the first aircraft to break the speed of sound in level flight, and would be the first of a series of NACA/NASA rocket-powered aircraft. Amongst these experimental aircraft were the North American X-15 and X-15A2 designs, which were operated for around a decade and eventually attained a maximum speed of Mach 6.7 as well as a peak altitude in excess of 100 km, setting new records in the process.

During the 1950s, the British developed several mixed power designs to cover the performance gap that existed in then-current turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high speed interception of high level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure that the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable gliding return. One design was the Avro 720, which was primarily propelled by an 8,000 lbf (36 kN) Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine that ran on kerosene fuel mixed with liquid oxygen as the oxidizing agent. Work on the Avro 720 was abandoned shortly after the Air Ministry&#x27;s decision to terminate development of the Screamer rocket engine, allegedly due to official concerns regarding the practicality of using liquid oxygen, which boils at -183 °C (90 K) and is a fire hazard, within an operational environment.

Work reached a more advanced stage with the Avro 720&#x27;s rival, the Saunders-Roe SR.53. The propulsion system of this aircraft used hydrogen peroxide as a combined fuel and oxidiser, which was viewed as less problematic than the Avro 720&#x27;s liquid oxygen. On 16 May 1957, Squadron Leader John Booth DFC was at the controls of XD145 for the first test flight, following up with the maiden flight of the second prototype XD151, on 6 December 1957. During the subsequent flight test programme, these two prototypes flew 56 separate test flights, during which a maximum speed of Mach 1.33 was recorded. Furthermore, since late 1953, Saunders-Roe had worked upon a derivative of the SR.53, which was separately designated as the &quot;SR.177&quot;; the principal change was the presence of an onboard radar, lacking on the SR.53 and the Avro 720 as it not being a requirement of the specification, but left the pilot dependent on his own vision other than radio-based directions supplied from ground-based radar control.

Both the SR.53 and its SR.177 cousin were relatively close to attain production status when wider political factors bore down upon the programme. During 1957, a massive re-thinking of air defence philosophy in Britain occurred, which was embodied in the 1957 Defence White Paper. This paper called for manned combat aircraft to be replaced by missiles, and thus the prospects of an order from the RAF evaporated overnight. While both the Royal Navy and Germany remained potential customers for the SR.177, the confidence of both parties was shaken by the move. Further factors, such as the Lockheed bribery scandals to compel overseas nations to order the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, also served to undermine the sale prospects of the SR.177, costing potential customers such as Germany and Japan.

Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s, the French Air Staff also had considerable interest in rocket-powered aircraft. According to author Michel van Pelt, French Air Force officials were against a pure rocket-powered flight but favoured a mixed-propulsion approach, using a combination of rocket and turbojet engines. While the Société d&#x27;Etudes pour la Propulsion par Réaction (SEPR) set about developing France&#x27;s own domestic rocket engines, the French aircraft manufacturer SNCASE was aware of the French Air Force&#x27;s keenness for a capable point defence interceptor aircraft, and thus begun work on the SNCASE SE.212 Durandal. In comparison to other French mixed-power experimental aircraft, such as the competing SNCASO Trident prototype interceptor, it was a heavier aircraft, intended to fly primarily on its jet engine rather than its rocket motor. A pair of prototype aircraft were constructed; on 20 April 1956, the first performed its maiden flight, initially flying only using jet power. It was the second prototype that first made use of the rocket motor during April 1957. During flight testing, a maximum speed of was attained at an altitude of, even without using the extra power of the rocket motor; this rose to 1667 km/h at 11,800 m while the rocket was active. A total of 45 test flights were performed prior to work on the programme being terminated.
At the request of the French Air Staff, the French aircraft company SNCASO also developed its own point defence interceptor, the SNCASO Trident. It was primarily powered by a single SEPR-built rocket engine and augmented with a set of wing-tip mounted turbojet engines; operationally, both rocket and turbojet engines were to be used to perform a rapid climb and interception at high altitudes, while the jet engines alone would be used to return to base. On 2 March 1953, the first prototype Trident I conducted the type&#x27;s maiden flight; flown by test pilot Jacques Guignard, the aircraft used the entire length of the runway to get airborne, being powered only by its turbojet engines. On 1 September 1953, second Trident I prototype crashed during its first flight after struggling to gain altitude after takeoff and colliding with an electricity pylon. Despite the loss, the French Air Force were impressed by the Trident&#x27;s performance and were keen to have an improved model into service. On 21 May 1957, the first Trident II, &quot;001&quot;, was destroyed during a test flight out of &quot;Centre d&#x27;Essais en Vol&quot; (Flight Test Center); caused when highly volatile rocket fuel and oxidiser, Furaline ( C13H12N2O) and Nitric acid (HNO3) respectively, accidentally mixed and exploded, resulting in the death of test pilot Charles Goujon. Two months later, all work was halted on the programme.

The advancement of the turbojet engine output, the advent of missiles, and advances in radar had made a return to mixed power unnecessary.
The development of Soviet rockets and satellites was the driving force behind the development of NASA&#x27;s space program. In the early 1960s, American research into the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar spaceplane was cancelled due to lack of purpose; later the studies contributed to the Space Shuttle, which in turn motivated the Soviet Buran. Another similar program was ISINGLASS which was to be a rocket plane launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrier, which was intended to achieve Mach 22, but this was never funded. ISINGLASS was intended to overfly the USSR. No images of the vehicle configuration have been released.

The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle was a mixed powered vehicle- a jet engine cancelled 5/6 of the force due to gravity, and the rocket power was able to simulate the Apollo lunar lander.

Various versions of the Reaction Motors XLR11 rocket engine powered the X-1 and X-15, but also the Martin Marietta X-24A, Martin Marietta X-24B, Northrop HL-10, Northrop M2-F2, Northrop M2-F3, and the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor, either as a primary or auxiliary engine.

The Northrop HL-10, Northrop M2-F2 and Northrop M2-F3 were examples of a lifting body, which are aircraft which have very little if any wing and simply obtain lift from the body of the vehicle. Another example is backslider rockets in amateur rocketry.

===Post Cold War era===

The EZ-Rocket research and test airplane was first flown in 2001. After evaluating the EZ-Rocket, the Rocket Racing League developed three separate rocket racer aircraft over the following decade.

During 2003, another privately developed rocket-powered aircraft performed its first flight. SpaceShipOne functions both as a rocket-powered aircraft—with wings and aerodynamic control surfaces—as well as a spaceplane—with RCS thrusters for control in the vacuum of space. For their work, the SpaceShipOne team were awarded the Space Achievement Award.

In April 2019, the Chinese company Space Transportation carried out a test of a 3,700-kilogram technology demonstrator named Jiageng-1. The 8.7-meter-long plane has a wingspan of 2.5 meters and it is a part of development of the larger, future Tianxing-I-1 vertical takeoff, horizontal landing reusable launch vehicle.

<text>Alistair Ian Cragg (born 13 June 1980 in Johannesburg) is a South African track and field athlete. He has since lived in England and United States where he attended the University of Arkansas. He races for Ireland and competes most often over 3000 metres and 5000 metres. He holds the Irish national records in both the 5000 metres and the 10,000 metres. He holds the European road running record in the 5 km in 13:26, set in Carlsbad, California.

==Career==

===College===
Cragg&#x27;s father was a coach in South Africa and now lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas with his wife. Alistair&#x27;s older brother, Duncan, went to Southern Methodist University from 1994 to 1999. Alistair followed him there in 1999. His first cross country season there, he was injured and finished the season poorly at the regional meet in Denton, Texas. Arkansas coach John McDonnell saw him after the race and said something about how he should not run if he was injured. The next spring, Alistair was the top freshman finisher in the 5000 m at the NCAA Championship meet, smashing SMU freshman records in that event.

The following autumn, one of Cragg&#x27;s brothers died and Alistair dropped out of SMU. After taking a year off, SMU had given away his scholarship and Alistair needed a new home. McDonnell made room for him on the Arkansas roster. Alistair had an outstanding college career with the Arkansas Razorbacks with McDonnell, winning individual NCAA titles at 3,000 m, 5,000 m and 10,000 m on the track, as well as indoor titles. In 2004, he was voted Southeastern Conference athlete of the year, and the &quot;Track and Field News&quot; magazine Collegiate Athlete of the Year.

Cragg is the University of Arkansas recordholder for 3,000 m and 5,000 m, and the only Razorback to win the 10,000, 5,000 and 1,500 meter races at a single SEC Outdoor Championship meet (2004) . He won seven NCAA championships while at the University of Arkansas including five indoors: 5000m (three straight from 2002-2004) and 3000m (2003 and 2004) and two outdoors: 10000m (2004) and 5000m (2003) . 

===Professional career===
Cragg declared for Ireland in 2003, having represented South Africa as a junior athlete in a cross country race. He qualified for an Irish passport on the basis of his Irish ancestry and first obtained Irish nationality in 1985.

It was seen as a controversial move as he had never lived in the country and only first visited when he was 24 years old. He currently runs for Clonliffe Harriers, a club in Dublin.

Cragg made his début for Ireland at the 2003 European Cross Country Championships, where he finished a respectable 8th. In the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens he finished as top European in the 5000 m at 12th place. Cragg won the gold medal in the 2005 European Indoor Championships for 3,000 m. Unfortunately for Cragg he could not build on this success as injury forced him to miss most of the outdoor season, including the 2005 IAAF Athletics World Championships. 

Cragg began the 2006 season well and finished 4th in the World Indoor Championships, just missing out on a medal. He was one of the favourites to win a medal in the 5000 m at the European Championships, but dropped out whilst leading the slow run final with around 800 metres to go. It is believed he had suffered an Achilles tendon injury. 

During the early part of the 2007 season, Cragg made Olympic &#x27;A&#x27; standards for the 2008 Olympic Games in the 1500 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres. Whilst recording the standard in the latter event, he broke the seven-year-old Irish record for the distance. Cragg finished second behind Cathal Lombard at the 2007 Irish Cross Country Championships, held in Belfast.

===Beijing Olympics===
In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Cragg competed in the 1500 m and 5000 m track events. He failed to qualify from heat section in the 1500m, finishing 8th with a time of 3:44.90. In the first heat of the 5000 m, he finished sixth in his heat of the 5000 m with a time 13:38.57.

Immediately after this race, thinking he had failed to qualify, Cragg was emotional when he was interviewed about the pressures that are associated with being an Irish athlete. He criticized Irish media, who he said, place too many demands on track and field athletes, and the Irish public, for criticizing the Olympic team too hastily. He criticized Ireland&#x27;s former middle-distance athletes for lambasting his performances, saying he could match the likes of Eamonn Coghlan and others in a race. Cragg sat by himself watching the other two heats, dejected at his performance. However, it turned out that he had qualified for his second Olympic final as a fastest loser, with the sixth fastest time of all the qualifiers. He went on to participate in the 5,000-metre final, but did not finish.

===International Competition===
In May 2009, he ran one of the best 5,000 metres of his career at the Adidas Track Classic in Carson, California in a time of 13:16.83. He also won the 2009 Irish 5000 m championship in August 2009.

He came second at the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Arizona Half Marathon in January 2011 behind Australian Shawn Forrest.

===Daegu, South Korea 13th IAAF World Championships in Athletics===
He reached the 5000 m final at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but finished in fourteenth place overall.

===Hometown===
The following month he ran at the Great South Run and claimed third place due to his well-timed pacing.

===London Olympics===
Cragg again competed in the 5000m, finishing 17th in his heat with a time of 13:47.01. A female reporter for RTÉ asked him, &quot;Realistically, should you have come to the Olympic Games?&quot; Bernice Harrison, writing in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, called this criticism &quot;harsh&quot;.

=== 2013 Fukuoka Marathon===
On 1 December, Alistair Cragg ran 2:23:05 and finished 26th.

<text>Lyle Arnold Berman (born August 6, 1941, in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American professional poker player and business executive.

==Business==
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father&#x27;s leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.

Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos&#x27; Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.

He won the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith &quot;Great American Traditions&quot; award in 1995 and the &quot;Gaming Executive of the Year&quot; award in 1996.

Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.

==Poker==
Berman has won three World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.

In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.

Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments. His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings. He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.

According to the James McManus book &quot;Positively Fifth Street&quot;, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book &quot;All-In&quot; is about Berman&#x27;s life.

Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children and 11 grandchildren.

==World Series of Poker Bracelets==

==Publications==
Berman co-authored &quot;I&#x27;m All In : Lyle Berman and the Birth of the World Poker Tour&quot; () with Marvin Karlins. The 2005 autobiography details Berman&#x27;s life from his childhood to his life as an adult, covering his business ventures, his opinions on poker and Las Vegas, and his experiences with designing and developing the World Poker Tour into what it is today.

<doc id="977530" wikidata="Q486649" url="?curid=977530" title="Andy Lee (South Korean singer)">
<text>Lee Sun-ho (; born January 21, 1981), mononymously credited as Andy (), is a South Korean singer, rapper and the youngest member of six-member boy band Shinhwa. Besides rapping for his band, Andy has ventured out into television acting, musicals, and solo singing. Andy is also the producer of duo Jumper and boy groups Teen Top, 100% and Up10tion.

==Biography==

===Pre-debut===
Andy Lee was raised in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, California, United States and had been a student at John F. Kennedy High School before moving to Seoul. He then completed high school at Korea Kent Foreign School in Seoul. Lee was the second member to join Shinhwa. He originally planned to be a member of H.O.T. (another Korean boy band) with his friend Tony Ahn. However, his parents pulled their support for him joining H.O.T. because they thought he was too young. Nevertheless, he continued to stay with the management of H.O.T. and was even featured as a rapper on female group S.E.S.&#x27;s single &quot;I&#x27;m Your Girl&quot; along with Eric Mun (Mun would later join Lee in Shinhwa as lead rapper).

When Andy was older, his parents let him join Shinhwa. He would continue with Shinhwa until the group&#x27;s fourth album when he took some time out to study in the U.S. (he later confessed that it actually was due to his care for seriously sick mother). For the group&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Perfect Man&quot; he returned and has been with the group ever since. His real English name was actually Jason, but SM Entertainment persuaded him to change it before his debut.

===2003: Solo artist===
In 2003, when the members of Shinhwa began doing solo activities, Lee surprised everyone by being an actor on various dramas, most notably the drama &quot;Lovers In Prague&quot;. Although he had a very minor role in the drama, it gained many viewers because of his role as a completely different, serious person. He began appearing in many banjun drama as well alongside former Fin.K.L member Lee Jin. The two acted together in numerous other banjun dramas as well as a couple for 6 months, longer than any other couple or actors/actresses did on the show segment for which they gained a lot of popularity due to their perfect match and chemistry. Lee was also an MC on SBS Inkigayo and MBC Goldfish, though in January 2007, he step down from being MC on both SBS Inkigayo and MBC Goldfish in a period of 3 days (SBS Inkigayo on January 28 &amp; MBC Goldfish on January 31).

In 2007, Lee left his group&#x27;s management to set up his own company, ND (New Dream) Entertainment, concentrating on his solo career. As Shinhwa was on hiatus, Lee return to acting in September 2007 to act as the lead role in a musical &quot;Music In My Heart (Season 3)&quot;, a type of project that none of the Shinhwa members have tried to pursue yet. After finishing performances for the musical, Lee released his very first digital single, titled &quot;Irrelevant [or Extraordinary] Imagination&quot; on November 30, 2007, a cover from the group Rollercoaster&#x27;s song. Due to the help of Park Jin Young (also known as JYP; CEO of JYP Entertainment) and Yubin of Wonder Girls, Lee was able to have a successful single. Yubin rapped while JYP wrote the lyrics for the rap part in the song. With the help, Lee was able to attract a lot of attention for the single. By releasing the digital single as well, Lee became the 5th member in Shinhwa to go solo behind Lee Min-woo, Shin Hye-sung, Jun Jin, and Kim Dong-wan, leaving Eric Mun as the only member to have not yet pursue a solo singing career.

In March 2008, Andy joined MBC&#x27;s reality show &quot;We Got Married&quot; where he was a couple with singer Solbi to act out the lives of newlyweds. Solbi and Andy made their official exit from &quot;We Got Married&quot; on October 5, 2008. He has taken an active career in stage such as playing as playing a 19-year-old in the musical &quot;Polaroid&quot; in August 2008, as well as live concerts throughout September and October. He has also produced a two-member boy band called Jumper under his company ND Entertainment. They have released two singles titled &quot;YES!&quot; featuring Eric and &quot;눈이부셔 (Sparkling Eyes)&quot; featuring Kang Jiyoung of Kara.

===2009-2011: Military service===
In November 2009, Lee commenced an Asia tour with stops in Taipei, Tokyo and Shanghai and concluded it just after Christmas and held a fan meeting, &quot;Andy Farewell Party-Bye for now&quot; a week before his enlistment. He enlisted for his mandatory military service on 11 January 2010 for 21 months of active duty at the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. He was discharged on 31 October 2011.

In 2010, TOP Media, Andy&#x27;s agency, debuted its first boy band Teen Top.

===2012: Shinhwa comeback and boy band 100%===
In March 2012, Lee reunited with his Shinhwa bandmates for their comeback after four years, under the management of &#x27;Shinhwa Company&#x27;. It is a joint venture agency for members to perform as a group, of which Eric and Lee Min-woo are co-CEOs and the remaining members are shareholders. The Company manages the group as a whole, whilst members&#x27; individual activities are managed by their respective agencies. The group released their tenth studio album &quot;The Return&quot; on 23 March 2012, launched their comeback concerts &quot;2012 Shinhwa Grand Tour: The Return&quot; throughout Asia and their first exclusive variety program &quot;Shinhwa Broadcast&quot; premiered on 17 March 2012 on cable channel JTBC.

In September, under TOP Media, he launched a new seven-member boy band 100% which debuted with the hit single &quot;Bad Guy&quot;.

===2013: Gambling conviction and hiatus===
In November 2013, Lee was indicted with illegally gambling on soccer matches, resulting in a fine of 5 million KRW. Shinhwa apologized on-air for Lee&#x27;s crime in December 2013 and Lee withdrew from all individual and group activities. As part of the hiatus, Lee&#x27;s previously filmed appearances on broadcast shows such as &quot;Shinhwa Broadcast&quot; were edited out. In February 2014, television station Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) announced Lee would be banned from broadcasting on the network.

In October 2014, Lee was announced to be returning with his group mates in a Chinese concert that was broadcast on Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) Inkigayo in January 2015. Soon after Shinhwa announced its February 2015 comeback with a full-length album, MBC announced it is lifting the ban on Lee.

== Personal life ==
On January 19, 2022, Andy wrote a letter announcing his marriage, posting it on his personal SNS. Andy&#x27;s fiancée is announcer Lee Eun-joo of Jeju MBC, who is 9 years younger than him.

On January 25, 2022, it was confirmed that Lee will be married on June 12, 2022.

<text>Guillaume de Palerme (&quot;William of [[Palermo|Palerne]]&quot;) is a French romance poem, later translated into English where it is also known as William and the Werewolf. The French verse romance was composed , commissioned by Countess Yolande (who is generally identified as Yolande, daughter of Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut). The prose version of the French romance, printed by N Bonfons, passed through several editions.

The English poem in alliterative verse, commissioned by Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford, was written by a poet named William. A single surviving manuscript of the English version is held at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The Oxford English Dictionary has cited this poem as being the earliest known use of singular &quot;they&quot; in written English.

==Plot==

Guillaume, a foundling supposed to be of low degree, is brought up at the court of the emperor of Rome, and loves the emperor&#x27;s daughter Melior who is promised to a Greek prince. The lovers flee into the woods disguised in bear-skins. Alfonso, who is Guillaume&#x27;s cousin and a Spanish prince, has been changed into a wolf-shaped werewolf by his stepmother&#x27;s enchantments. He provides food and protection for the fugitives, and Guillaume eventually triumphs over Alfonso&#x27;s father, and wins back from him his kingdom. The benevolent werewolf is disenchanted and marries Guillaume&#x27;s sister.

==Motifs==
The werewolf as used in this story draws on later developments of that legend than such lais as &quot;Bisclavret&quot; and &quot;Melion&quot;, where the werewolf status is inherent, although his obeisance to the king, his father, corresponds to the same act in the other stories. The werewolf&#x27;s protection of the child probably stems from the anecdote found in both &quot;The Seven Sages&quot; and &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;. But the werewolf&#x27;s attack on his wicked stepmother corresponds to that of the werewolf on his false wife in &quot;Bisclavret&quot; and &quot;Melion&quot;, and Guillaume plays the same role as the king, protecting the werewolf after the attack.

The love of Guillaume and Melior, though presented as classical courtly love, ends in marriage and children—a deviation from the original formulation of courtly love that grew common in romances of this era.

<text>Pål Arne Fagernes (8 June 1974 – 4 August 2003) was a Norwegian javelin thrower. He represented Asker SK and IK Tjalve during his active career.

As a junior, Fagernes competed on top national level in cycling, athletics, and cross country skiing, before deciding to focus on javelin.

He made his international athletics debut at the 1994 European Cup, and competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics, 1997 World Championships and 1998 European Championships without reaching the final rounds. Competing for the Arizona State Sun Devils track and field team, he won the 1996 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

His international breakthrough came at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, where he finished fourth with a Norwegian record throw of 86.24 metres. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney he established a Norwegian record of 86.74 metres in the qualifying round. In the final he threw 83.04 metres to finish ninth. His 86.74 m throw remained his career best.

His first medal at the Norwegian championships was a silver medal in 1994. He became Norwegian champion in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2002. In 2002 Fagernes decided to take up boxing. He boxed one professional boxing match in the heavyweight class in 2003, which he beat his opponent Peter Simko on technical knockout after 25 seconds.

Over the years Fagernes&#x27; sporting career became tainted by personal problems. In 2000 he was sentenced to 18 days in prison for letting an intoxicated person drive his car. In 2001, shortly after withdrawing from the 2001 World Championships for disciplinary reasons, he was caught using cocaine in a police razzia. He was, however, cleared of doping charges. In April 2003 he was charged with property damage after walking on a car roof in Oslo.

Fagernes died in a car accident on the European route E6 north of Moss in August 2003, when his car collided with a lorry. His Norwegian record would remain until June 2005, when it was improved to 86.82 metres by reigning Olympic champion Andreas Thorkildsen. Thorkildsen would later improve the record further.

<doc id="977534" wikidata="Q836076" url="?curid=977534" title="Lipka Tatars">
<text>The Lipka Tatars (the term &quot;Lipka&quot; refers to &quot;Lithuania&quot;; they are otherwise known as Lipkas or Lithuanian Tatars; later referred to as Polish Tatars, Polish–Lithuanian Tatars, Belarusian Tatars, &quot;Lipkowie&quot;, &quot;Lipcani&quot;, &quot;Muślimi&quot;, and &quot;Lietuvos totoriai&quot;) are a Tatar ethnic group and minority in Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus who originally settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the beginning of the 14th century.

The first Tatar settlers tried to preserve their Turco-Mongol shamanistic religion and sought asylum amongst the pre-Christian Lithuanians. Towards the end of the 14th century, another wave of Tatars—this time, Islamized Turks, were invited into the Grand Duchy by Vytautas the Great. These Tatars first settled in Lithuania proper around Vilnius, Trakai, Hrodna, and Kaunas and later spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. These areas comprise parts of present-day Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars. From the Battle of Grunwald onwards, the Lipka Tatar light cavalry regiments participated in every significant military campaign of Lithuania and Poland.

The Lipka Tatar origins can be traced back to the descendant states of the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, and Kazan Khanate. They initially served as a noble military caste but later they became urban-dwellers known for their crafts, horses, and gardening skills. Throughout centuries they resisted assimilation and kept their traditional lifestyle. While they remained very attached to their religion, over time they lost their original Tatar language, from the Kipchak group of Turkic languages, and for the most part adopted Belarusian, Lithuanian, and Polish. There are still small groups of Lipka Tatars living in Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland, as well as their communities in the United States.

==Name==

The name Lipka is derived from the old Crimean Tatar name of Lithuania. The record of the name Lipka in Oriental sources permits us to infer an original Libķa/Lipķa, from which the Polish derivative Lipka was formed, with possible contamination from contact with the Polish &quot;lipka&quot; &quot;small lime-tree&quot;; this etymology was suggested by the Tatar author S. Tuhan-Baranowski. A less frequent Polish form, Łubka, is corroborated in Łubka/Łupka, the Crimean Tatar name of the Lipkas up to the end of the 19th century. The Crimean Tatar term &quot;Lipka Tatarłar&quot; meaning &quot;Lithuanian Tatars&quot;, later started to be used by the Polish–Lithuanian Tatars to describe themselves.

Over time, the lower and middle Lipka Tatar nobles adopted the Ruthenian language then later the Belarusian language as their native language. However, they used the Arabic alphabet to write in Belarusian until the 1930s. The upper nobility of Lipka Tatars spoke Polish.

Diplomatic correspondence between the Crimean Khanate and Poland from the early 16th century refers to Poland and Lithuania as the &quot;land of the Poles and the Lipkas&quot;. By the 17th century the term Lipka Tatar began to appear in the official documents of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

The migration of Tatars into the lands of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the territories of the Golden Horde began during the 14th century and lasted until the end of the 17th century. There was a subsequent wave of Tatar immigrants from Soviet Russia after the October Revolution of 1917, although these consisted mostly of political and national activists.

Lipka Tatars living in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had about 400 mosques serving them. According to the &quot;Risāle-yi Tatar-i Leh&quot; (trans: &quot;Message Concerning the Tatars of Poland&quot;, an account of the Lipka Tatars written for Suleiman the Magnificent by an anonymous Polish Muslim during a stay in Constantinople in 1557–1558 on his way to Mecca) there were 100 Lipka Tatar settlements with mosques in Poland. The largest communities existed in the cities of Lida, Navahrudak, and Iwye. There was a Lipka Tatar settlement in Vilnius, known as Totorių Lukiškės, Tatar quarter in Trakai and in Minsk, today&#x27;s capital of Belarus, known as Tatarskaya Slabada.

In the year 1672, the Tatar subjects rose up in open rebellion against the Commonwealth. This event was remembered as the Lipka rebellion. Thanks to the efforts of King John III Sobieski, who was held in great esteem by the Tatar soldiers, many of the Lipkas seeking asylum and service in the Ottoman army returned to his command and participated in the military struggles against the Ottoman Empire in the Great Turkish War up to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, which ended the Ottoman expansion in Europe with their defeat.

Beginning in the late 18th and throughout the 19th century, the Lipkas became successively more and more Polonized. The upper and middle classes in particular adopted Polish language and customs, while the lower ranks became Ruthenized. At the same time, the Tatars held the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas (&quot;Wattad&quot; in Tatar), who encouraged and supported their settlement in the late 14th and early 15th century, in great esteem, including him in many legends, prayers and their folklore. Throughout the 20th and since the 21st century, most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably; for example, the Tatar women in Poland do not practice veiling (wearing headscarf/hijab) or view it as a mandatory religious obligation.
===Timeline===
* 1226: The Khanate of the White Horde was established as one of the successor states to the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan. The first Khan, Orda was the second son of Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis Khan. The White Horde occupied the southern Siberian steppe from the east of the Urals and the Caspian Sea to Mongolia.
* 1380: Khan Tokhtamysh, the hereditary ruler of the White Horde, crossed west over the Urals and merged the White Horde with the Golden Horde whose first khan was Batu, the eldest son of Jochi. In 1382 the White and Golden Hordes sacked and burned Moscow. Tokhtamysh, allied with the great central Asian Tatar conqueror Tamerlane, reasserted Mongol power in Russia.
* 1397: After a series of disastrous military campaigns against his former protector, the great Tatar warlord Tamerlane, Tokhtamysh and the remnants of his clan were granted asylum and given estates and noble status in Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Vytautas the Great. The settlement of the Lipka Tatars in Lithuania in 1397 is recorded in the Chronicles of Jan Długosz.


* 1397: The Italian city state of Genoa funded a joint expedition by the forces of Khan Tokhtamysh and Grand Duke Vytautas against Tamerlane. This campaign was notable for the fact that the Lipka Tatars and Lithuanian armies were armed with handguns, but no major victories were achieved.
* 15 July 1410: The Battle of Grunwald took place between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on one side (c. 39,000 troops), and the Teutonic Knights on the other (c. 27,000 troops). The Teutonic knights were defeated and never recovered their former influence. After the battle, rumours spread across Europe that the Germans had only been defeated thanks to the aid of tens of thousands of heathen Tatars, though it is likely there were no more than 1,000 Tatar horse archers at the battle, the core being the entourage of Jalal ad-Din, son of Khan Tokhtamysh. At the start of the battle, Jalal ad-Din led the Lipka Tatar and Lithuanian light cavalry on a suicide charge against the Teutonic Knights&#x27; artillery positions – the original &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;. The Teutonic Knights&#x27; Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen responded by ordering his own heavy cavalry to pursue the Lipkas away from the field of battle, trampling through their own infantry in the process. The resulting destruction of the Teutonic Knights&#x27; line of battle was a major factor in their subsequent defeat. This incident forms one of the highlights of Aleksander Ford&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Krzyżacy&quot; (&quot;Knights of the Teutonic Order&quot;), based on the historical novel of the same name by Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz.
* 1528: The Polish (szlachta) and Lithuanian nobility&#x27;s legal right to retribution on the grounds of the wounding or killing of a nobleman or a member of his family is extended to the Lipka Tatars.
* 1569: The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is founded at the Union of Lublin. Companies of Lipka Tatar light cavalry for a long time constituted one of the foundations of the military power of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Lithuanian Tatars, from the very beginning of their residence in Lithuania were known as the Lipkas. They united their fate with that of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the Battle of Grunwald onwards they participated in every significant military campaign.
* 1591: The rule of the fervent Catholic Sigismund III (1587–1632) and the Counter-Reformation movement brought a number of restrictions to the liberties granted to non-Catholics in Poland, the Lipkas amongst others. This led to a diplomatic intervention by Sultan Murad III with the Polish king in 1591 on the question of freedom of religious observance for the Lipkas. This was undertaken at the request of Polish Muslims who had accompanied the Polish King&#x27;s envoy to Istanbul.
* 1672: The Lipka Rebellion. As a reaction to restrictions on their religious freedoms and the erosion of their ancient rights and privileges, the Lipka Tatar regiments stationed in the Podolia region of south-east Poland abandoned the Commonwealth at the start of the late 17th century Polish–Ottoman Wars that were to last until the end of the 17th century with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. The Lipka Rebellion forms the background to the novel &quot;Pan Wolodyjowski&quot;, the final volume of the historical &quot;Trylogia&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Nobel Prize winning author (1905) who was himself descended from Christianised Lipka Tatars. The 1969 film &quot;Pan Wolodyjowski&quot;, directed by Jerzy Hoffman and starring Daniel Olbrychski as Azja Tuhaj-bejowicz, still remains among the biggest box-office successes in the history of Polish cinema.
* 1674: After the famous Polish victory at Chocim, the Lipka Tatars who held the Podolia for Turkey from the stronghold of Bar were besieged by the armies of Jan Sobieski, and a deal was struck that the Lipkas would return to the Polish side subject to their ancient rights and privileges being restored.
* 1676: The Treaty of Zurawno that brought a temporary end to the Polish–Ottoman wars stipulated that the Lipka Tatars were to be given a free individual choice of whether they wanted to serve the Ottoman Empire or the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
* 1677: The Sejm in March 1677 confirmed all the ancient Tatar rights and privileges. The Lipka Tatars were permitted to rebuild all their old mosques, to settle Christian labour on their estates and to buy up noble estates that had not previously belonged to Tatars. The Lipka Tatars were also freed from all taxation.
* 1679: As a reward for their return to the Commonwealth the Lipka Tatars were settled by King Jan Sobieski on Crown Estates in the provinces of Brest, Kobryn and Hrodna. The Tatars received land that had been cleared of the previous occupants, from 0.5 to 7.5 square kilometres per head, according to rank and length of service.
* 1683: Many of the Lipka Tatar rebels who returned to the service of the Commonwealth in 1674 were later to take part in the Vienna campaign of 1683. This included the 60 Polish Tatars in the light cavalry company of Samuel Mirza Krzeczowski, who was later to save the life of King Jan III Sobieski during the disastrous first day of the Battle of Parkany, a few weeks after the great victory of the Battle of Vienna that was to turn the tide of Islamic expansion into Europe and mark the beginning of the end for the Ottoman Empire. The Lipka Tatars who fought on the Polish side at the Battle of Vienna, on 12 September 1683, wore a sprig of straw in their helmets to distinguish themselves from the Tatars fighting under Kara Mustafa on the Turkish side. Lipkas visiting Vienna traditionally wear straw hats to commemorate their ancestors&#x27; participation in the breaking of the Siege of Vienna.
* 1699: Some of the Kamieniec-based Lipka Tatars who had remained loyal to the Turkish Sultan were settled in Bessarabia along the borderlands between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as well as in the environs of Chocim and Kamieniec-Podolski and in the town known as Lipkany. A further large scale emigration of Lipkas to Ottoman controlled lands took place early in the 18th century, after the victory won by King Augustus II over the Polish-born King Stanisław Leszczyński, whom the Lipkas had supported in his war against the Saxon King.
* 1775: The Polish Lipkas came back into favour during the reign of the last King, Stanislas Augustus (1765–95). In 1775 the Sejm reaffirmed the noble status of the Polish Lithuanian Tatars. After the Partitions of Poland, the Lipkas played their part in the various national uprisings, and also served alongside the Poles in the Napoleonic army.
* 1919: The Polish Lipkas joined the newly created Polish Army formations; Pułk Jazdy Tatarskiej and later, 13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans.
* 1939: With the re-emergence of the Polish state after the First World War, a Polish Tatar regiment was re-established in the Polish Army which was distinguished by its own uniforms and banners. After the fall of Poland in 1939, the Polish Tatars in the Wilno (Vilnius) based 13th Cavalry Regiment were one of the last Polish Army units recorded carrying on the fight against the German aggressors while led by Major Aleksander Jeljaszewicz.

==Present status==
Today there are about 10,000–15,000 Lipka Tatars in the former areas of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The majority of descendants of Tatar families in Poland can trace their descent from the nobles of the early Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lipka Tatars had settlements in north-east Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, south-east Latvia and Ukraine. Today most reside in Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus.

Most of the Lipka Tatars (80%) assimilated into the ranks of the nobility in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth while some lower noble Tatars assimilated to the Belarusian, Polish, Ukrainian and Lithuanian townsfolk and peasant populations.

A number of the Polish Tatars emigrated to the US at the beginning of the 20th century and settled mostly in the north eastern states, although there is also an enclave in Florida. A small but active community of Lipka Tatars exists in New York City. &quot;The Islamic Center of Polish Tatars&quot; was built in 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City, and functioned until recently.

After the annexation of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union in 1939 and then following World War II, Poland was left with only 2 Tatar villages, Bohoniki and Kruszyniany. A significant number of the Tatars in the territories annexed by the USSR repatriated to Poland and clustered in cities such as Gdańsk (Maciej Musa Konopacki – patriarch of the Polish Orient), Białystok, Warsaw and Gorzów Wielkopolski totaling some 3,000 people. One of the neighborhoods of Gorzów Wielkopolski where relocated Tatar families resettled has come to be referred to as &quot;the Tatar Hills&quot;, or in Polish &quot;Górki Tatarskie&quot;.

In 1925 the Muslim Religion Association () was formed in Białystok, Poland. In 1992, the Organization of Tatars of the Polish Republic () with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk, began operating.

In Poland, the 2011 census showed 1,916 people declaring Tatar ethnicity.

In November 2010, a monument to Poland&#x27;s Tatar populace was unveiled in the port city of Gdańsk at a ceremony attended by President Bronislaw Komorowski, as well as Tatar representatives from across Poland and abroad. The monument is a symbol of the important role of Tatars in Polish history. &quot;Tatars shed their blood in all national independence uprisings. Their blood seeped into the foundations of the reborn Polish Republic,&quot; President Komorowski said at the unveiling. The monument is the first of its kind to be erected in Europe.

==Genetics==
Lipka Tatars&#x27; paternal gene pool comprises 15 haplogroups. Some have clear geographical affinities, including east Europe and the Volga–Uralic region (N-Tat, R1a-M458, R1a-M558, R1b-M412 and R1b-M478), Central Asia (R1a-Z2125 and Q-M242), South Siberia (Q-M242 and R1b-M478), the Caucasus and the Middle East (G2a-U1, J1-P58, J2a-M410 and J2b-M12).

Dominant Y-DNA haplogroups among Lipka Tatars are R1a (54%) – both Slavic and Steppe Asiatic one – J2 (18,9 %) which is of Middle Eastern and south Asian origin, and haplogroup Q (10,8 %). Other haplogroups are G (8.1%), N (5.4%) and J1 (2.7%).

According to the whole genome sequencing, around two-thirds of the Lipka Tatar genomes are composed of the European and Middle Eastern/Caucasus components, with remaining one-third belonging to two sub-variants of the general east Eurasian component: east Asian and Siberian. Taken together, both PC and ADMIXTURE analyses suggest the presence of a significant amount of east Eurasian-specific alleles among the autosomal genomes of Lipka Tatars.

<text>Monica Potter (June 30, 1971) is an American actress. She is known for her starring roles in the films &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), and &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (2001). She also appeared in the horror film, &quot;Saw&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, a 2009 remake film.

Potter has also appeared on television, as a series regular on &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, as well as a Golden Globe-nominated role as Kristina Braverman in the NBC drama series &quot;Parenthood&quot; (2010–2015). She was a series regular in the CBS drama &quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot;.

Potter is also known as the founder and principal owner of Monica Potter Home, an upscale home goods, natural skin care and home decor business in Cleveland, Ohio. With the family business struggling to make money, the company was featured on the reality TV show, &quot;The Profit&quot;.

==Early life==
Monica Potter&#x27;s mother was a secretary in a hospital, and her father invented the first flame-resistant car wax. Potter has three sisters (Kerry, Jessica, and Brigette). Her maternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and she was raised Catholic. As a child, Potter wanted to be a nun.

During her childhood she attended the Villa Angela Academy, and graduated from Euclid High School. She also spent part of her early years in Arab, Alabama. Potter had wanted to be an actress since childhood. She began acting at the Cleveland Play House when she was in elementary school. Starting at age 12, she worked at a flower shop, and later in her teens, she worked in a sub sandwich shop and did some modeling for newspaper and magazine ads and local commercials. After appearing in several commercials in Chicago, Potter relocated to Los Angeles in 1994. In 1995, she appeared in the Alan Jackson music video for &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot;.

==Career==
Potter made her screen debut in 1994, on CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Sharon Newman. In 1995, Potter was featured in the music video for the song &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot; by country artist Alan Jackson. She later appeared in several feature films, including &quot;Con Air&quot; (playing the wife of Nicolas Cage&#x27;s character) and starring opposite Robin Williams in &quot;Patch Adams&quot;. In 1998, she played the love interest of doomed distance runner Steve Prefontaine in the movie &quot;Without Limits&quot;, and also appeared in the British comedy &quot;Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence&quot; (1998). In 2001, she had two major roles, co-starring with Freddie Prinze, Jr. in &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, and in the thriller &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; with Morgan Freeman, based on the James Patterson best-seller.

In 2004, Potter played the role of Alison Gordon in the first &quot;Saw&quot; film. Later Potter worked on television. She was a cast member of the ABC legal drama &quot;Boston Legal&quot; but left during the second season. In 2009, Potter became a cast member of the new TNT series &quot;Trust Me&quot; which was cancelled after the first season due to low ratings. In 2009, she had a lead role in the horror-thriller remake of Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, opposite Tony Goldwyn.

Potter played the role of Kristina Braverman in the comedy-drama &quot;Parenthood&quot;, receiving critical acclaim for her performance in the fourth season. In 2013, she won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Drama Supporting Actress and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her role in the show.

In 2014, Potter created Monica Potter Home, an upscale home goods, natural skin care and home decor business in Cleveland, Ohio. The business began based on her skin care regimen that made use of Sea Buckthorn essential oils. Her father started using a balm, a natural product, on her when she was a young child because of her eczema. The business is a family affair; her mother and sisters work for her in the business. In 2017, with the business failing, she collaborated with Marcus Lemonis of CNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Profit&quot;. She and her business appeared with her family and coworkers on Season 5, Episode 4.

In 2015, Potter was joined by her mother and all three sisters on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;. The following year, she appeared in a HGTV reality series titled &quot;Welcome Back Potter&quot;, which chronicled the purchase and restoration of her childhood home in Cleveland, Ohio thirty years after the family sold it in 1987.

In 2016, Counting Crows&#x27; frontman Adam Duritz confirmed that the band&#x27;s song Mrs Potter&#x27;s Lullaby, from the album &quot;This Desert Life&quot; (1999), was written about an imaginary version of her, as they had never met. Duritz explained that serendipity led to them meeting (for the first time) for a casual supper with industry friends the day the band was recording the song, and Potter returned to the studio with Duritz to watch them record. They became friends, and a tape he forgot he gave her on the night of the recording ended up salvaging the song, which the band felt they had ruined during post-production and had decided to not keep on the album.

==Personal life==
Potter was married to Tom Potter from 1990 to 1998; together they have two sons Daniel and Liam. In 2005, Potter married Daniel Christopher Allison, an orthopedic surgeon.
Potter and Allison have one daughter, Molly. In March 2015, Potter&#x27;s husband joined the US Navy Reserve as a physician, with the starting rank of Lieutenant Commander. In February 2018, the couple filed for divorce.

Potter&#x27;s father died in 2002 of cardiovascular disease.

<text>Väisälä is a tiny lunar impact crater located on a rise in the Oceanus Procellarum. Sharing the same continental island are the brilliant crater Aristarchus to the south-southeast and Herodotus to the south-southwest. Väisälä lies just to the west of the Rupes Toscanelli fault line, and the Rimae Aristarchus rille system. To the southwest is the notable Vallis Schröteri cleft.

This formation is circular and cup-shaped, with a higher albedo than the surrounding dark surface. It was previously designated Aristarchus A before being named after prolific Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä by the IAU in 1973.

<text>Justus Ludwig Adolf Roth (September 15, 1818, Hamburg – April 1, 1892) was a German geologist and mineralogist.

==Biography==
In 1844 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Jena and spent the next few years working as a pharmacist in Hamburg. In 1848 he relocated to Berlin, where he came under the influence of Gustav Rose and Heinrich Ernst Beyrich. In 1867 he became an associate professor of mineralogy at the University of Berlin.

He may be regarded as one of the founders of petrographical science. In his published papers he dealt with metamorphism and crystalline schists, discussed the origin of serpentine, and wrote about the rocks of Mount Vesuvius and Ponza Island.

<text>TheRoyal Australian Regiment (RAR) is the parent administrative regiment for regular infantry battalions of the Australian Army and is the senior infantry regiment of the Royal Australian Infantry Corps. It was originally formed in 1948 as a three battalion regiment; however, since then its size has fluctuated as battalions have been raised, amalgamated or disbanded in accordance with the Australian government&#x27;s strategic requirements. Currently, the regiment consists of seven battalions and has fulfilled various roles including those of light, parachute, motorised and mechanised infantry. Throughout its existence, units of the Royal Australian Regiment have deployed on operations in Japan, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, Vietnam, Somalia, Rwanda, Cambodia, East Timor, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Organisation==
The Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) is part of the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, along with the six state-based infantry regiments of the Australian Army Reserve. It is the most senior of the corps&#x27; regiments in the order of precedence, and currently consists of seven Regular Army infantry battalions:
*1st Battalion (1 RAR) – Air mobile infantry
*2nd Battalion (2 RAR) – amphibious/light infantry
*3rd Battalion (3 RAR) – mechanised infantry
*5th/7th Battalion (5/7 RAR) – motorised infantry reformed in 2024.
*6th Battalion (6 RAR) – mechanised infantry
*8th/9th Battalion (8/9 RAR) – motorised infantry.

The battalions of the regiment are capable of providing seven of the ten regular battlegroups that the Australian Army has available for deployment. The current order of battle sees 5 and 7 RAR as part of the 1st Brigade based in Darwin and Adelaide; 1 and 3 RAR as part of the 3rd Brigade in Townsville, and 6 and 8/9 RAR as part of the 7th Brigade in Brisbane. 2 RAR in Townsville reports directly to 1st Division Headquarters.

===Former battalions===
* 2nd/4th Battalion (1973–95), delinked to 2 RAR and 4 RAR
* 4th Battalion (1964–73 and 1995–2009), renamed as 2nd Commando Regiment
* 5th Battalion (1965–73 and 2006–2024), linked to 7 RAR
* 7th Battalion (1965–73 and 2007–2024), linked to 5 RAR
* 8th Battalion (1966–73), amalgamated to 8/9 RAR
* 9th Battalion (1967–73), amalgamated to 8/9 RAR
* 10th Independent Rifle Company (1974 – late 1990s), disbanded.

==History==

===Formation, 1948===
The origins of the Royal Australian Regiment lie in the decision made by the Australian government to raise a force for occupation duties in Japan at the end of the Second World War. The 34th Australian Infantry Brigade was raised in October 1945 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) personnel then serving in the South West Pacific Area, with the three battalions of the brigade designated as the 65th, 66th and 67th Australian Infantry Battalions of the AIF. The 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division and the 2/40th Battalion. The 66th Battalion received volunteers from the 9th Division and 1st Australian Corps troops. The 67th Battalion was formed from the 3rd, 6th, and 11th Divisions. After concentrating on the island of Morotai, the 34th Brigade moved to Japan and joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in February 1946.

The 34th Brigade became the basis of the post-war Regular Army in 1947, and when the decision was taken in 1948 to withdraw two of the battalions to Australia, attention turned to the status and designation of these units. Brigadier Ronald Hopkins, commander of the brigade, was concerned that despite the unit prestige and regimental spirit developed since October 1945, it would be undesirable to have the regular units the highest numbered, without battle honours or colours, and with precedence after Militia units. Consideration was given to whether the battalions might be designated as separate regiments. For example, the 65th Battalion might have become the 1st Infantry Battalion, City of Sydney&#x27;s Own Regiment under one proposal or the 1st Battalion, King George VI&#x27;s Australian Rifle Regiment under another. Instead, the decision was taken to number the units sequentially as part of one large regiment and so on 23 November 1948 the 65th, 66th and 67th Battalions became the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Australian Regiment. An application was made for a royal title, which was granted on 10 March 1949. The Royal Australian Regiment thus came into being as Australia&#x27;s first regiment of regular infantry. Since formation the battalions of the regiment have competed against each other in an annual military skills competition known as the Gloucester Cup.

===Early years: Japan and Australia, 1948–1950===
The formation of the regiment following the end of the Second World War was fundamentally important to the post-war Australian Army, forming a key component of the first &quot;permanent, professional army, available in peace and war for any task the government might direct&quot;. Prior to this time the Australian Army had been substantially a part-time militia with a permanent cadre. A major influence in the raising of the regiment was Australia&#x27;s desire to secure a prominent role in the occupation of Japan and the eventual peace settlement. After some delays the 65th, 66th and 67th Battalions arrived in Japan&#x27;s Hiroshima Prefecture in February 1946. Subsequent employment &quot;involved activities designed to reinforce upon the Japanese the lesson of their defeat&quot;, in addition to guard duty, patrolling and training. In December 1948 the Australian component of the BCOF was reduced from a brigade to one understrength battalion, with the 1st and 2nd Battalions returning to Australia, while the 3rd Battalion remained in Japan.

On return to Australia the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade. The 1st Battalion was subsequently based in Ingleburn, New South Wales, and the 2nd Battalion at Puckapunyal, Victoria. Both units were significantly understrength as many men discharged on returning to Australia, while others elected to remain in Japan with the 3rd Battalion. Alan Morrison, a former member of the regiment, later recalled that for the two battalions that returned to Australia &quot;...the first eighteen months of the regiment&#x27;s existence were harrowing times&quot;. Many men discharged due to frustration and discontent, while the battalions were not strong enough to undertake meaningful training activities and their barracks were in a state of disrepair. Yet from this experience came the core &quot;...of dedicated soldiers destined to be the non-commissioned officers of the regiment in the Korean War and the outstanding warrant officers and sergeants of the battalions that served in Malaya and in the early part of the Vietnam campaign&quot;.

The regiment has provided units and individuals for virtually all Australian Army deployments and operations since its formation. The first period of sustained operational service began with the regiment&#x27;s first deployment in Korea in 1950 and continued until the withdrawal of combat units from Vietnam in 1972. These 22 years were arguably the most significant for the regiment with between one and three battalions involved in combat operations in South-East Asia at any one time. A second lengthy period of operational service commenced with the intervention in East Timor in 1999, which became the first of many commitments for the regiment that have continued to the present day. Approximately 85,000 personnel have served in the RAR during this time, with casualties sustained by the regiment on operations including 693 killed and over 3,000 wounded.

===Korean War, 1950–1953===
The Korean War was the first major test of the regiment. Following preparations in Japan, 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September 1950 and was attached to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. The initial invasion of South Korea by the North Korean People&#x27;s Army (NKPA) had been broken by General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s amphibious landing at Inchon, and so, in what was a complicated war of manoeuvre, 3 RAR was involved in the pursuit of the NKPA back across the 38th parallel. On 21 October 1950, 3 RAR took part in the Battle of Yongyu in an apple orchard north of Pyongyang, the first large-scale engagement fought by a battalion of the regiment. The farthest north 3 RAR would advance into North Korea was the Pakchon–Chongju area following the Battle of Chongju, and it was near here that Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Green, the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, was mortally wounded on 30 October 1950. By November 1950, following the Chinese intervention, 3 RAR was withdrawing south along with the rest of the allied Eighth Army, fighting the Battle of Pakchon. However, following a UN counteroffensive a defensive line was established about north of Seoul and it was here in April 1951 that 3 RAR, along with the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and supporting UN forces, fought a successful defensive action at the Battle of Kapyong. This battle proved to be the climactic point of the regiment&#x27;s first year in Korea.

By June 1951, 3 RAR moved to a position on the Imjin River under the command of the US I Corps and it was here that the battalion would spend the next two years of the war. The major action fought by the regiment in the second half of 1951 was the Battle of Maryang San, where 3 RAR, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hassett, assaulted Hill 317 on 5 October 1951. Known as Operation Commando, Hill 317 was captured after five days of hard fighting. Following this action the war was defined by fixed defences of trenches, bunkers and wire, constant patrolling, and numerous clashes. In April 1952, 3 RAR was joined by 1 RAR and command of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, of which they were now a part, passed to an Australian officer as a result. Meanwhile, the expansion of the commitment in Korea to two battalions resulted in the establishment of a regimental depot at Ingleburn in 1952 to train and hold infantrymen for service in Korea. In April 1953, 1 RAR was replaced by 2 RAR on a system of unit rotation. During this changeover a parade was held to mark the first occasion that all battalions of the regiment had been on parade together. 1 RAR served a year in Korea, 2 RAR for four months before the armistice, while 3 RAR served throughout the war, earning itself the nickname of &quot;Old Faithful&quot;. The last major action of the war for the regiment was the Battle of the Samichon River fought by 2 RAR over 24–26 July 1953, repulsing a number of major Chinese assaults just hours before the Armistice Agreement was signed.

Following the armistice both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created. The period that followed proved uneventful, yet the UN forces were required to maintain combat readiness and the ability to react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire. In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan. Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment. The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience, establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army. The Korean War remains the only large-scale, conventional war that the regiment has fought. During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time.

===Malaya and Borneo, 1955–1966===
In April 1955 the Australian government had committed army, navy and air force elements to the Far East Strategic Reserve to assist in the defence of Malaya from internal and external security threats. While British Commonwealth forces had been operating against the communist terrorists since 1948, the battalions of the regiment came relatively late to the Malayan Emergency, and when 2 RAR arrived in theatre in October 1955 to join the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, the war had been running for over seven years. 2 RAR was replaced by 3 RAR in 1957, which was in turn replaced by 1 RAR in 1959. During the Emergency the three battalions were involved in 45 contacts, killing 17 guerrillas for the loss of seven men killed in action. According to Jim Molan the attention to detail required of five years of infantry soldiering in Malaya exposed the regiment to jungle warfare skills developed by the British Army during its most successful counterinsurgency war. This experience later informed the development of its own doctrine, with the Malayan Emergency making a significant contribution to the professionalism of the regiment. Meanwhile, the regimental depot—which had been renamed 4 RAR soon after formation—was subsequently incorporated into the School of Infantry and renamed Depot Company, Royal Australian Regiment in 1960. Despite the end of the State of Emergency in Malaya, 1 RAR was employed on anti-terrorist operations along the Thai border in late 1960. 1 RAR was replaced in Malaya by 2 RAR in 1961, with the battalion involved in training and counter-terrorist operations. It was subsequently employed on operations along the Thai border for three months in mid-1962, and again in May and June 1963, being involved in a number of minor contacts. 2 RAR handed over to 3 RAR in August, and returned to Australia. 3 RAR was also committed to operations along the Thai border in early 1964.

Between 1963 and 1966, Indonesia pursued a policy of &quot;Konfrontasi&quot;, or Confrontation, with Malaysia. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca on mainland Malaysia, was subsequently used with British and New Zealand forces to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. On 13 February 1965, 3 RAR was warned for service in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, commencing in March. 3 RAR completed a four-month tour mounting numerous security patrols in its area of operations, including a number of sensitive cross-border patrols into the Indonesian regency of Sarawak as a part of Operation Claret, which resulted in actions at Sungei Koemba, Kindau and Babang, between late May and July. Operations on the Sarawak border &quot;were a severe test of the skill, discipline and professionalism of the infantry, involving long periods in the jungle or in the company bases.&quot; Out of the 30 Claret operations conducted by 3 RAR, 12 were reconnaissance patrols, while the remainder were ambushes or fighting patrols, four of which resulted in contact with Indonesian forces. 4 RAR, having been reformed as a battalion the previous year, assumed responsibility from 3 RAR at Camp Terendak in October 1965. Deploying forward to Borneo in April 1966, it remained there until September and like its predecessor, conducted a demanding routine of internal security and cross-border patrols.

===Expansion of the regiment, 1960s===
The early 1960s were a period of strategic uncertainty and increasing commitments in South East Asia. Consequently, the Australian government re-introduced selective conscription in late-1964 and directed a significant increase in the strength of the Army. Yet unlike during the 1950s when National Servicemen bolstered the strength of CMF, under the new scheme they would serve for two years in the Regular Army instead. This substantial period of service for the regiment in Australia, Malaysia, and Vietnam saw the government direct the expansion of the regiment from four to nine battalions. By September 1965 the regiment consisted of seven battalions; by July 1966, eight; and by November 1967, nine. 4 RAR was formed in February 1964; 1 RAR abandoned the Pentropic Establishment (1,300 personnel) to revert to the Tropical Establishment (800 personnel), allowing 5 RAR to form in March 1965; 6 RAR was formed from a cadre drawn from 2 RAR in June 1965; 3 RAR assisted the formation of 7 RAR in September 1965; 8 RAR formed in August 1966; and 9 RAR was raised in November 1967.

===Vietnam War, 1962–1972===
Although individual members of the regiment had served as advisors with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) since 1962, it was not until April 1965 that the government announced that a battalion would be deployed to South Vietnam. Between June 1965 and March 1972 the units of the regiment would conduct sixteen rotations in South Vietnam, with the first seven battalions completing two 12-month tours, while 8 and 9 RAR would each serve one. Consequently, following a period of hurried training and administration 1 RAR joined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa Air Base northeast of Saigon in June 1965. After initially defending the airbase, 1 RAR steadily increased the scope of its patrols. For example, in January 1966, 1 RAR assaulted a large Vietcong (VC) headquarters complex in the Ho Bo Woods as a part of Operation Crimp; which the Americans hailed as the first strategic intelligence victory of the war. The battalion subsequently completed a 12-month-tour attached to US forces, during which it developed new tactics and techniques that later became standard for Australian battalions and supporting arms and services that would subsequently operate in Vietnam.

In March 1966, Prime Minister Harold Holt announced that Australia would increase its commitment to South Vietnam. In May 1966 the newly raised 5 and 6 RAR arrived in theatre as a part of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in Phuoc Tuy Province, establishing a base at Nui Dat. After two months of constant patrolling by both battalions, 6 RAR was engaged in the action that would become a defining part of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war; the Battle of Long Tan. Fought on 18 August 1966, 108 men from D Company, 6 RAR fought a ferocious meeting engagement with the VC 275th Regiment, possibly reinforced by at least one North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) battalion, and D445 Battalion (between 1,500 and 2,500 personnel). After fighting for two and a half hours, D Company was surrounded on three sides. However, with the assistance of strong artillery support they were able to hold their position until the timely arrival of a relief force of infantry and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) finally forced the VC to break. In the words of the official historian, Ian McNeill, &quot;D Company had achieved a stunning victory&quot;.

In 1967, 2 and 7 RAR assumed responsibility in Phuoc Tuy from their predecessors and continued the extensive patrolling, and cordon and searches characteristic of this conflict. In August 1967, 7 RAR fought elements of the VC 3rd Battalion, 274th Regiment in the Battle of Suoi Chau Pha, where extensive artillery support again proved decisive. A third infantry battalion arrived in December 1967 as part of a significant expansion of 1 ATF. By the time of the Tet Offensive in 1968, 1 and 3 RAR were serving in theatre. During actions at Fire Support Base (FSB) Coral by 1 RAR and at FSB Balmoral by 3 RAR in May and June 1968, later known as the Battle of Coral–Balmoral, these two battalions of the regiment would fight battles with conventional attributes not seen since Kapyong. In June 1969, an infantry company from 5 RAR, then on its second tour, and supported by a troop of tanks and another of APCs fought a significant combined arms action against a battalion-sized force of PAVN regulars and VC local force troops during the Battle of Binh Ba.

Following Binh Ba, the remainder of the regiment&#x27;s service would be characterised largely by the policies of &quot;Pacification&quot; and &quot;Vietnamization&quot;, with an emphasis on ambushing and patrolling to protect the local population and training South Vietnamese troops to increasingly replace US and allied forces. The withdrawal of Australian forces from South Vietnam began in November 1970 when 8 RAR completed its tour of duty and was not replaced. Where possible, the Australians still sought to bring VC units to battle, such as during Operation North Ward, where V Company, 4 RAR/NZ fought elements of the Chau Duc and Ba Long guerrilla units in August and September 1971. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, with the last combat elements of the regiment (D Company, 4 RAR) returning to Australia in February 1972. The regiment sustained losses of 325 killed and over 2,000 wounded in South Vietnam.

===Peacetime service, 1973–1998===
With the withdrawal of the battalion serving in Singapore as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve, 1973 finally saw all units of the regiment stationed in Australia for the first time. Thus began a period of peace-time soldiering of a sort not before seen in the regiment. The end of National Service significantly diminished the strength of the Army, and at this time the government directed that the number of battalions in the regiment be reduced to six, which was achieved by linking 2 and 4 RAR, 5 and 7 RAR, and 8 and 9 RAR. The strength of units and resources were also reduced, with a shift in strategic and tactical concepts from forward defence to defence of continental Australia. Regardless, from September 1973 the battalions of the regiment provided a company on three monthly rotations to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Meanwhile, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, Royal Australian Regiment (10 IRC) was raised on 23 May 1974 to provide an opposing force for units training at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra.

The 1980s saw the introduction of battalion specialisations—light, parachute, mechanised and motorised—in the regiment and the formation of a ready deployment force. The later concept was first tested during Operation Morris Dance, the contingency mounted in response to the 1987 Fiji coup. 5/7 RAR subsequently developed as a mechanised battalion equipped with M113 armoured personnel carriers, while 3 RAR re-roled as a parachute battalion. In 1988, during the Australian Bicentennial celebrations, a contingent drawn from the battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Salter of 1 RAR, supported by an Australian Army Band, was deployed as part of the bicentennial celebrations to mount public duties at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle, St James&#x27;s Palace and the Tower of London, the first Australian troops to do so since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1991, the two Brisbane-based battalions—6 RAR and 8/9 RAR—then part of the 6th Brigade, became Ready Reserve battalions. Following trials of the concept 6 RAR reequipped as a motorised battalion in 1992, while 8/9 RAR commenced is conversion in 1996. Each battalion was initially issued modified 6x6 Land Rover Perenties until a purpose-built infantry mobility vehicle could be acquired.

Although individual members of the regiment served on deployment in such locations as the Sinai, the Balkans, Western Sahara and Bougainville, it was not until 1993 that the regiment conducted another formed-body deployment. On 15 December 1992 the government announced that 1 RAR would deploy as a part of the US-led and UN-sanctioned Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. The Australian commitment, known as Operation Solace, saw 1 RAR deployed for 17 weeks to a Humanitarian Relief Sector (HRS) centred on the township of Baidoa. In the course of four months over 8,311 tonnes of humanitarian aid was delivered. 1 RAR also protected Baidoa airfield, provided security in the township, conducted in-depth patrolling of the HRS, as well as escorting aid convoys within it. 1 RAR was never seriously challenged by the Somali bandits, although there were a number of contacts which resulted in casualties on both sides. One Australian was accidentally killed during the deployment.

In May 1993, a detachment from 12 Platoon, D Company, 2/4 RAR was deployed to Cambodia to provide security to the Australian contribution to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Operating from Battambang airport in north-west Cambodia in support of the Army Aviation Group, they conducted static defensive tasks, patrolling and provided a ready reaction force. They joined another detachment of personnel from 5/7 RAR&#x27;s Support Company, which had been deployed to undertake communications tasks as part of the Force Communications Unit. The deployment came to an end in November 1993. In 1994, the raising of a fifth battalion was approved, with 2/4 RAR de-linked the following year, and 4 RAR returning to the order of battle in its own right.

Between August 1994 and August 1995, two companies of the regiment, initially A Company, 2/4 RAR and then B Company, 2 RAR, served with the Australian contingent of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). From 20 to 23 April 1995, a 50-member detachment, including infantrymen from 5 Platoon, B Company, 2 RAR were forced to witness the Kibeho massacre of around 4,000 Hutu refugees at the Kibeho camp by members of the Rwandan Patriotic Army. Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a mandate that did not allow them to engage the perpetrators, the infantrymen were forced into a passive role during the massacre. Throughout the incident, however, they worked under fire attempting to assist wounded refugees. Meanwhile, 8/9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme.

===East Timor 1999–2003===

East Timor&#x27;s ballot in favour of independence after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted in a wave of violence by militia groups and pro-integration factions within the Indonesian military. 2 RAR and 3 were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 as part of the UN-sanctioned International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure. 5/7 RAR joined them in October 1999 once Dili had been stabilised. Despite minor clashes, including a contact at Motaain on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999, control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in February 2000. At this time, 5/7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War. From 1999 to 2004, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/7, and 6 RAR rotated through East Timor (with all bar 4 RAR deploying twice), giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience. One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations, while several more were wounded. 

===Timor Leste 2006–2010 ===
Two years after being withdrawn, the deteriorating situation in the East Timor, now known as Timor Leste—again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations, this time under Operation Astute. In response to the initial crisis, 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in May 2006. It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR, designated the ANZAC Battle Group. Subsequent rotations included elements of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8/9 RAR in the years that followed. 8/9 RAR handed over to Army Reserve Task Groups and, after a phased drawdown, the last Australian Defence Force (ADF) elements were withdrawn in 2013. 

===Solomon Islands===
Events in East Timor largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands, where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards with the initial response being provided by 2 RAR. One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands. The Regiment subsequently handed over to 2 Div units who saw the mission through to the end.

===Iraq ===

The regiment had only a minor role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, providing a force element of about 40 Commandos from 4 RAR to support the Special Forces Task Group, which was based on an SASR Squadron. Following the invasion, the deteriorating security situation in Baghdad saw the deployment of a combined arms Security Detachment (SECDET), charged with protecting the Australian embassy and its personnel. Over a dozen companies of the regiment provided force elements to the various rotations. In February 2005 Prime Minister John Howard committed a battle group to southern Iraq to partially replace a Dutch unit that had been operating in the Governorate of Al Muthanna. The regiment&#x27;s contribution to the first battle group, initially known as the Al Muthanna Task Group, was a rifle company, although the second and third rotations were led by 5/7 RAR and 2 RAR respectively. When Provincial Iraqi Control was declared in Al Muthanna in July 2006, AMTG 3, led by 2 RAR, was renamed the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)). The fifth battle group to serve in Iraq was based on 5 RAR, by which time OBG(W) was operating in both the Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar Governorates as a part of the British Multi-National Division South East (MND(SE)). (AMTG 1, OBG(W) 2 and OBG(W) 4 were all based on cavalry regiment headquarters). During this time elements of the regiment conducted counterinsurgency operations until withdrawn in mid-2008. Casualties in Iraq included one member of the regiment who was accidentally killed.

===Afghanistan===

Meanwhile, a Reconstruction Taskforce (RTF) based around the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with protective elements from the 5/7 RAR, 6 RAR and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006 as part of Operation Slipper. The RTF formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt. However, as the Australian commitment expanded, by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion-sized battle group consisting of infantry, engineers, cavalry, artillery and logistic elements, usually based on a unit of the Royal Australian Regiment. Known as the Mentoring Task Force (MTF), it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces. Partnered with the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), it operated throughout Uruzgan Province. While attached to MTF-1, soldiers from Combat Team Delta (based on D Company, 6 RAR) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in Deh Rahwod on 24 August 2010. Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia for his role in the battle, the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award. The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces, although a small force protection element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and advisory mission. Twelve members of the regiment have been killed in Afghanistan.

===Special Operations===
The Special Air Service Regiment owes its heritage to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 it became an independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army&#x27;s special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment in its own right on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia&#x27;s national interests. Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical assault group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army&#x27;s order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.

===21st century reorganisation===
In 2005, the Australian Army began planning for a reorganisation as part of an initiative known as &quot;Hardening and Networking the Army&quot; (HNA). The key impact of this plan on the regiment was that 3 RAR would surrender its parachute role, moving from Sydney to Adelaide to become the Army&#x27;s second mechanised battalion. However, in August 2006 the government announced that the regiment would expand from five to seven battalions, as part of an initiative known as &quot;Enhanced Land Force&quot; to be implemented together with a modified HNA. As such, 5/7 RAR conducted a de-linking parade on 3 December 2006, reforming as 5 RAR and 7 RAR. 5 RAR reformed in a largely mature state and included a company serving on operations in Iraq, while 7 RAR reformed with a company on operations in Afghanistan. Both battalions remained in the mechanised role. Meanwhile, the regiment marked its 60th Birthday on 23 November 2008 with a parade at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, including a Queens Guard provided by 3 RAR and the Colours of the Regiment. Achieving operational status in 2009, 7 RAR relocated to Adelaide in 2011. Under the new scheme 3 RAR relinquished the parachute role, becoming a light infantry battalion. It subsequently relocated to Townsville in 2012. 8/9 RAR reformed as a motorised battalion at Enoggera on 31 October 2007 in the last element of the Enhanced Land Force, and was equipped with Bushmaster PMVs. It subsequently served on operations in Timor Leste and Afghanistan.

In 2009, the reorganisation was again re-titled, this time as the &quot;Adaptive Army&quot; which sought to re-balance the Army and shape it to become an adaptive, learning organisation. Under the Plan Beersheba element of the Adaptive Army reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Light Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a Combat Service Support Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. With the establishment of the Armoured Cavalry Regiments, 5 and 7 RAR gave up their M113 armoured personnel carriers and re-roled as light infantry. Meanwhile, the motorised battalions also re-roled as light infantry with a transport squadron being established in each Combat Service Support Battalion equipped with Bushmaster PMVs to provide protected mobility. 2 RAR was selected to specialise in amphibious warfare.

In 2017, further changes to the Beersheba Combat Brigade construct were announced known as the &quot;workforce alignment&quot; of Plan Beersheba with the PMVs and M113s again planned to go back to the infantry battalions, with each brigade to include one motorised infantry battalion and one mechanised infantry battalion. Under this plan in 1st Brigade 5 RAR will receive PMVs and 7 RAR will be equipped with M113s, in 3rd Brigade PMVs will go to 1 RAR and M113s to 3 RAR, while in the 7th Brigade 8/9 RAR will receive PMVs and 6 RAR will get M113s. 2 RAR will continue to specialise in amphibious operations.

In 2023, a new defence review saw the implementation of a new structure to the army&#x27;s combat forces, which saw the Royal Australian Regiment reduced by one battalion through the 5th and 7th Battalions once again being merged to form the single 5/7 RAR, based in Darwin as part of 1st Brigade.

<text>Sir John Snell (1629 – 6 August 1679), founder of the Snell Exhibitions at the University of Oxford, was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of a blacksmith. He attended the University of Glasgow from 1642 to 1644.

He joined the royalists during the English Civil War, and fought in several battles, including the Battle of Worcester. Thereafter he took refuge in Cheshire, where he met Sir Orlando Bridgeman, whose clerk he became, being raised to the offices of court-crier and seal-bearer as his patron was promoted to those of judge and Lord Keeper.

Later he was secretary to the Duke of Monmouth and had the management of his Scottish estates. He died at Oxford in 1679 and was buried in St Cross Church, Oxford, leaving a bequest for sending students from the University of Glasgow to an Oxford college or hall. The Court of Chancery decided in 1693 that Balliol should receive the beneficiaries. Adam Smith was one beneficiary of the Snell Scholarship.

<doc id="977559" wikidata="Q101094405" url="?curid=977559" title="Castillo de San Marcos">
<text>The Castillo de San Marcos (Spanish for “St. Mark’s Castle”) is the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States; it is located on the western shore of Matanzas Bay in St. Augustine, Florida.

It was designed by the Spanish engineer Ignacio Daza, with construction beginning in 1672, 107 years after the city&#x27;s founding by Spanish Admiral and conquistador Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, when Florida was part of the Spanish Empire. The fort&#x27;s construction was ordered by Governor Francisco de la Guerra y de la Vega after a raid by the English privateer Robert Searles in 1668 that destroyed much of St. Augustine and damaged the existing wooden fort. Work proceeded under the administration of Guerra&#x27;s successor, Manuel de Cendoya in 1671, and the first &quot;coquina&quot; stones were laid in 1672. The construction of the core of the current fortress was completed in 1695, although it would undergo many alterations and renovations over the centuries.

When Britain gained control of Florida in 1763 pursuant to the Treaty of Paris, St. Augustine became the capital of British East Florida, and the fort was renamed Fort St. Mark until the Peace of Paris (1783) when Florida was transferred back to Spain and the fort&#x27;s original name restored. In 1819, Spain signed the Adams–Onís Treaty which ceded Florida to the United States in 1821; consequently, the fort was designated a United States Army base and renamed Fort Marion, in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. The fort was declared a National Monument in 1924, and after 251 years of continuous military possession, was deactivated in 1933. The site was subsequently turned over to the United States National Park Service. In 1942 the original name, &quot;Castillo de San Marcos&quot;, was restored by an Act of Congress.

Castillo de San Marcos was attacked several times and twice besieged: first by English colonial forces led by Carolina Colony Governor James Moore in 1702, and then by English Georgia colonial Governor James Oglethorpe in 1740. However, possession of the fort has changed five times, all peaceful, among four different governments: Spain, 1695–1763 and 1783–1821, Kingdom of Great Britain, 1763–1783, and the United States, 1821–date (during 1861–1865, under control of the Confederate States of America). Owing to its strategic cannon placement and star-shaped design, the fort was never breached or taken by force throughout its various stages of sovereign ownership.

Under United States control the fort was used as a military prison to incarcerate members of Native American tribes starting with the Seminole—including the famous war chief, Osceola, in the Second Seminole War—and members of western tribes, including Geronimo&#x27;s band of Chiricahua Apache. The Native American art form known as Ledger Art had its origins at the fort during the imprisonment of members of the Plains tribes such as Howling Wolf of the southern Cheyenne.

Although built in part by African slaves owned by the Spanish, the fort later served as one of the first entry points of fugitive slaves from British North America into Spanish Florida, where they were freed by the Spanish colonial authorities. This quickly led to the first free Black settlement in the future United States (Fort Mose, formed just north of St Augustine).

Ownership of the Castillo was transferred to the National Park Service in 1933, and, along with the nearby St. Augustine Historic District, has been a popular tourist destination ever since.

==Structure==

The European city of St. Augustine was founded by the admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés for the Spanish Crown in 1565 on the site of a former Native American village called Seloy.

The need for fortifications was recognized after it was attacked by Sir Francis Drake and his fleet of 22 ships in 1586, and over the next 80 years, a succession of nine wooden forts were built in various locations along the coastline. After an attack in 1668 by the English pirate Robert Searle, however, during which the town of St. Augustine was burned to the ground, wooden forts were deemed inadequate, and Mariana, Queen Regent of Spain, approved the construction of a masonry fortification to protect the city.

The Castillo is a masonry star fort made of a stone called &quot;coquina&quot; (Spanish for &quot;small shells&quot;), which consists of ancient shells that have bonded together to form a sedimentary rock similar to limestone. Native Americans from Spain&#x27;s nearby missions did most of the labor, with additional skilled workers brought in from Havana, Cuba. The coquina was quarried from the &#x27;King&#x27;s Quarry&#x27; on Anastasia Island in what is today Anastasia State Park across Matanzas Bay from the Castillo, and ferried across to the construction site. Construction began on and lasted twenty-three years, with completion in 1695.

The fort has four bastions named San Pedro, San Agustín, San Carlos, and San Pablo, with a ravelin protecting the sally port. On the two landward sides, a large glacis was constructed which would force any attackers to advance upward toward the fort&#x27;s cannon and allow the cannon shot to proceed downslope for greater efficiency in hitting multiple targets. Also, the artificial mound of the glacis in front of the walls helped to protect them from direct cannon fire attempting to breach them in a siege. Immediately surrounding the fort was a moat which was usually kept dry, but that could be flooded with seawater to a depth of about in case of attack by land.

Multiple embrasures were built into the curtain wall along the top of the fort as well as into the bastions for the deployment of a cannon of various calibers. Infantry embrasures were also built into the walls below the level of the terreplein for the deployment of muskets by the fort&#x27;s defenders. It was through one of these embrasures that twenty Seminoles held as prisoners would escape in 1837.

== History ==

===First English siege===

In 1670, Charles Town (modern-day Charleston, South Carolina) was founded by English colonists. As it was just two days&#x27; sail from St. Augustine, the English settlement and encroachment of English traders into Spanish territory spurred the Spanish in their construction of a fort.

Slaves from the Carolina colony began escaping to St Augustine in 1687, where the Spanish agreed to free (and employ) them if they converted to Catholicism. When an English major from Carolina attempted to retrieve escapees in 1688, the Spanish Governor Diego de Quiroga refused. Charles II of Spain issued an official policy in 1693, cementing the informal practice.

In 1702, English colonial forces under the command of Carolina Governor James Moore Sr. embarked on an expedition to capture St. Augustine early in Queen Anne&#x27;s War. The English laid siege to St. Augustine in November 1702. About 1,500 town residents and soldiers were crammed into the fort during the two-month siege. The small English cannons had little effect on the walls of the fort, because the &quot;coquina&quot; masonry was very effective at absorbing the impact of cannonballs causing them to sink into the walls, rather than shattering or puncturing them.

The siege was broken when the Spanish fleet from Havana arrived, trapping some English vessels in the bay. The English decided to burn their ships to prevent them from falling under Spanish control, and then marched overland back to Carolina. The town of St. Augustine was destroyed, in part by the Spanish and in part by the English, as a result of the siege.

===Second period of construction===

Beginning in 1738, under the supervision of Spanish engineer Pedro Ruiz de Olano, the interior of the fort was redesigned and rebuilt. Interior rooms were made deeper, and vaulted ceilings replaced the original wooden ones. The vaulted ceilings allowed for better protection from bombardments and allowed for cannon to be placed along the gun deck, not just at the corner bastions. The new ceilings required the height of the exterior wall to be increased from 26 to .

===Second British siege===
Spain and Britain were rivals in Europe, and since the two countries had both founded empires in the New World, their rivalry continued there as well. In 1733, the British merchantmen &quot;Rebecca&quot;, commanded by Captain Robert Jenkins, was seized in the Caribbean by the Spanish coast guard. Suspecting that &quot;Rebecca&quot; had been trading illegally with Spanish colonies (which was forbidden by both Spain and Britain), the Spanish searched the ship. A fight broke out between the Spanish and British sailors. In the skirmish, Jenkins had his ear cut off by a Spanish officer, who picked it up and said &quot;Take this to your king and tell him that if he were here I would serve him in the same manner!&quot; When Jenkins reported the incident to British authorities, they used it as a &quot;casus belli&quot; to declare war on Spain in 1739. The war was called the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

After British Admiral Edward Vernon won a significant victory at Portobelo, General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, was quick to imitate him in North America. In June 1740, Oglethorpe and a British fleet of seven ships appeared off St. Augustine. As in the 1702 siege, three hundred soldiers and 1,300 residents found refuge within the Castillo&#x27;s walls. For 27 days the British bombarded the Castillo and St. Augustine. Realizing his cannon were not affecting the Castillo&#x27;s walls of coquina, Oglethorpe decided to starve the people of St. Augustine into submission by blockading the inlet at the Matanzas River and all roads into St. Augustine. However, some supplies were able to reach the city via the river, and with morale and supplies low for the British forces, Oglethorpe had to retreat. In order to protect the city from future blockades and sieges, the Spanish built Fort Matanzas to guard the river, which could be used as a rear entrance to avoid St. Augustine&#x27;s primary defense system.

===British occupation===

In 1763, the British managed to take control of the Castillo but not by force. As a provision of the Treaty of Paris (1763) after the Seven Years&#x27; War, Britain gained all of Spanish Florida in exchange for returning Havana and Manila to Spain. On July 21, 1763, the Spanish governor turned the Castillo over to the British, who established St. Augustine as the capital of the province of East Florida, established by the Royal Proclamation of 1763.

The British made some changes to the fort, and renamed it Fort St. Mark. As Great Britain was the dominant power in North America, they were not worried about keeping the fort in top condition. This attitude prevailed until the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The fort was used as a military prison during the war. Among those imprisoned was Christopher Gadsden, the Lieutenant governor of South Carolina. He was also a delegate to the Continental Congress and a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the war. He was released after 11 months.

Improvements were begun on the fort, in keeping with its new role as a base of operations for the British in the South. The gates and walls were repaired, and second floors were added to several rooms to increase the housing capacity of the fort. The Castillo saw action during the American Revolution mainly as a prison, although St. Augustine was targeted by several aborted expeditions from Georgia. Several revolutionary fighters who had been captured in Charleston were held there when it was taken by the British, including three Founding Fathers; Thomas Heyward Jr., Arthur Middleton, and Edward Rutledge. The Spanish declared war on Britain in 1779, drawing off forces from Fort St. Mark and keeping the British occupied. Bernardo de Gálvez, governor of Spanish Louisiana, attacked several British-held cities in West Florida, capturing all of them. The only major British operation that used troops from St. Augustine was the poorly coordinated but successful capture of Savannah, Georgia; the city was taken by troops from New York before those from St. Augustine arrived.

At the end of the war, the Peace of Paris (1783) called for the return of Florida to Spain. On July 12, 1784, Spanish troops returned to St. Augustine.

===Second Spanish period===

When Spain regained control over Florida they found a much-changed territory. Many Spaniards had left Florida after the handover to Britain, and many British citizens stayed after it was returned to Spain. Many border problems arose between Spanish Florida and the new United States. Spain changed the name of the fort back to the Castillo de San Marcos, and continued to build upon the improvements that Britain had made to the fort in an effort to strengthen Spain&#x27;s hold on the territory. However, due to increased pressure from the United States and several other factors, in 1819 Spain signed the Adams–Onís Treaty, ceding Florida to the United States, which was transferred in 1821.

===First United States period===

Upon receiving the fort from Spain, the Americans changed its name to Fort Marion. It was named to honor General Francis Marion, an American Revolutionary War hero nicknamed &quot;The Swamp Fox.&quot; Structurally, the Americans made few changes to the fort during this time. Many storerooms were converted to prison cells on account of their heavy doors and barred windows. Also, part of the moat was filled in and transformed into an artillery battery as part of the American coastal defense system. The original Spanish seawall was dismantled to ground level and a new seawall constructed immediately adjacent to the seaward side of the original. At this time a hotshot furnace was also built in the filled-in section of the moat behind the newly built water battery. Cannonballs were heated in the furnace to fire at wooden enemy ships.

In October 1837, during the Second Seminole War, Seminole chief Osceola was taken prisoner by the Americans while attending a peace conference near Fort Peyton under a flag of truce. He was imprisoned in Fort Marion along with his followers, including Uchee Billy, King Philip and his son Coacoochee (Wild Cat), and then transported to Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island in Charleston&#x27;s harbor. Uchee Billy was captured on September 10, 1837, and he died at the fort on November 29. His skull was kept as a curio by Frederick Weedon. The doctor also decapitated Osceola after his death in Fort Moultrie and kept the head in preservative.

On November 19, 1837, Coacoochee and nineteen other Seminole, including two women, escaped from Fort Marion. Coacoochee, known for fabricating entertaining stories, later said that only he and his friend Talmus Hadjo had escaped - by squeezing through the eight-inch (203 mm) opening of the embrasure located high in their cell and sliding down a makeshift rope into the dry moat. Hadjo, however, was not on the official list of prisoners. However the Seminole escaped, they made their way to their band&#x27;s encampment at the headwaters of the Tomoka River, about forty miles south of St. Augustine. Because of their having been poorly treated, they vowed to continue fighting, and the war was prolonged for four more years. The cell from which Coacoochee escaped was long part of the official lore of the fort.

===Confederate States period===
In January 1861, Florida seceded from the United States in the opening months of the American Civil War. Union troops had withdrawn from the fort, leaving only one man behind as caretaker. On January 7, 1861, three days before Florida seceded, 125 militiamen marched on the fort by the order of Governor Madison S. Perry. The Union soldier manning the fort refused to surrender it unless he was given a receipt for it from the Confederacy. He was given the receipt, and the fort was taken by the Confederacy without a shot. General Robert E. Lee, then in command of the coastal defenses of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida, ordered that most of the artillery in the fort be sent to other, more strategic, forts. This left only five cannons in the water battery to defend Fort Marion.

The Saint Augustine Blues, a militia unit formed in St. Augustine, were enrolled into the Confederate Army at Ft. Marion on August 5, 1861. They were assigned to the recently organized Third Florida Infantry as its Company B. More than a dozen former members of the St. Augustine Blues are buried in a row at the city&#x27;s Tolomato Cemetery. Men from the unit were most likely part of the force that originally occupied the fort on January 7, 1861. 

The fort, along with the rest of the city of St. Augustine, was reoccupied by Union troops after acting mayor Cristobal Bravo officially surrendered the city to Union Navy fleet commander Christopher Raymond Perry Rodgers on March 11, 1862. The Confederate forces left the city the previous evening in anticipation of the arrival of the Union fleet under the command of Commodore Dupont.

===Second United States period===

The fort was taken back by Union forces on March 11, 1862, when the USS &quot;Wabash&quot; entered the bay, finding the city evacuated by Confederate troops. The city leaders were willing to surrender in order to preserve the town, and the city and the fort were retaken without firing a shot. Throughout the rest of the fort&#x27;s operational history, it was used as a military prison.

Beginning in 1875, numerous Native American prisoners were held at the fort in the aftermath of the Indian Wars in the west. Many would die at the fort. Among the captives were Chief White Horse of the Kiowa, and Chief Grey Beard of the southern Cheyenne.

During this period, Richard Henry Pratt, a Civil War veteran, supervised the prisoners and upgraded the conditions for them. He removed the prisoners&#x27; shackles and allowed them out of the casemates where they had been confined. He developed ways to give the men more autonomy and attempted to organize educational and cultural programs for them. They became a center of interest to northerners vacationing in St. Augustine, who included teachers and missionaries. Pratt recruited volunteers to teach the Indian prisoners English, the Christian religion, and elements of American culture. He and most US officials believed that such assimilation was needed for the Indians&#x27; survival in the changing society.

The men were also encouraged to make art; they created hundreds of drawings. Some of the collection of Ledger Art by Fort Marion artists is held by the Smithsonian Institution. It may be viewed online.

Encouraged by the men&#x27;s progress in education, residents and visitors to St. Augustine raised funds for scholarships to support nearly 20 of the former prisoners in college after they were released from Ft. Marion. Seventeen men attended the Hampton Institute, a historically black college established in 1868 for freedmen by the American Missionary Association.

Others were sponsored and educated in New York State at private colleges. Among the latter were David Pendleton Oakerhater, as he became known, who was sponsored by US Senator George H. Pendleton (D-OH) and his wife. Oakerhater studied and later was ordained as an Episcopal priest. He returned to the West to work as a missionary with Indian tribes. He was later recognized by the Episcopal Church as a saint.

Pratt&#x27;s experiences at Fort Marion were the basis for his campaign to create American Indian boarding schools. He was authorized to found the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879, which became a model for other government-funded boarding schools established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It operated until 1918. At their peak, some 350-450 schools were established, and only 25 were off-reservation.

From 1886 to 1887, approximately 491 Apaches were held prisoner at Fort Marion; many were of the Chiricahua and Warm Springs Apache bands from Arizona. There were 82 men and the rest were women and children. Among the men, 14, including Chatto, had previously been paid scouts for the US Army. Among the Chiricahua were members of the notable chief Geronimo&#x27;s band, including his wife. Geronimo was sent to Fort Pickens, in violation of his agreed terms of surrender. While at the fort, many of the prisoners had to camp in tents, as there was not sufficient space for them. At least 24 Apache died as prisoners and were buried in North Beach.

In 1898, over 200 deserters from the Spanish–American War were imprisoned at the fort. This marked one of the last uses of the fort as an operational base. In 1900, the fort was taken off the active duty rolls after 205 years of service under five different flags.

=== Preservation ===

In 1924, Fort Marion was designated as a National Monument. In 1933 it was transferred to the National Park Service from the War Department.

In 1942, in honor of its Spanish heritage, Congress authorized renaming the fort as &quot;Castillo de San Marcos&quot;.

In 1964 the Castillo figured in the civil rights movement, when the &quot;Freedom Tree&quot; on the fort green became a gathering place for demonstrators who were not welcome across the street on what was state or private property in the age of segregation. The demonstrations in St. Augustine, led by Robert Hayling, Hosea Williams, and Martin Luther King played an important role in bringing about passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the two great legislative accomplishments of the movement.

As a historic property of the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on October 15, 1966. The National Park Service manages the Castillo together with Fort Matanzas National Monument. In 1975, the Castillo was designated an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Since being transferred to the Park Service, the Castillo has become a popular tourist attraction. It occupies in downtown St. Augustine, Florida.
==In popular culture==
The fort has been featured on many television shows including &quot;Monumental Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, as well as the 1951 film &quot;Distant Drums&quot;.

<doc id="977562" wikidata="Q217158" url="?curid=977562" title="Tammuz (Hebrew month)">
<text>Tammuz (Hebrew: , &#x27;), orTamuz, is the tenth month of the civil year and the fourth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar, and the modern Assyrian calendar. It is a month of 29 days, which occurs on the Gregorian calendar around June–July.

The name of the month was adopted from the Assyrian and Babylonian month &quot;Araḫ Dumuzu&quot;, named in honour of the Mesopotamian deity Dumuzid.

== Holidays ==
17 Tammuz – Seventeenth of Tammuz – is a fast day from 1 hour before sunrise to sundown in remembrance of Jerusalem&#x27;s walls being breached. 17 Tammuz is the beginning of The Three Weeks, in which Jews follow similar customs as the ones followed during the Omer from the day following Passover until the culmination of the mourning for the death of the students of Rabbi Akiva (the 33rd day of the Omersuch as refraining from marriage and haircuts.) The Three Weeks culminate with Tisha B&#x27;Av (9th of Av).

:Ashkenazi communities refrain from wine and meat from the beginning of the month of Av, while Sefardi communities only do so from the second day of the month. The mourning continues until noon on the 10th of Av, the date on which the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction was complete.

== In fiction ==
* In the story of Xenogears, Tammuz is the name of a country, named after the Hebrew month. In the official Japanese version translation, however, it was transliterated &quot;Tamuzu&quot;. This was later further changed by the translation process to &quot;Thames&quot; for the English version.

* &quot;Tammūz&quot; (Arabic: ﺗﻤﻮﺯ), is also the name for the month of July in Iraq, the Levant and Turkey (&quot;Temmuz&quot; in Turkish). In Syriac it is &quot;ܬܡܘܙ&quot;. In Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinian territories, the 2006 Lebanon War is generally known as حرب تموز &quot;Ḥarb Tammūz&quot; (i.e. the July War), following the Arab custom of naming the Arab-Israeli wars after months or years.

<doc id="977563" wikidata="Q2319325" url="?curid=977563" title="Kazuo Taoka">
<text>was one of the most prominent yakuza godfathers.

Known as the &quot;Godfather of Godfathers&quot; and &quot;The Japanese Godfather&quot;, Taoka was third &quot;kumicho&quot; of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan&#x27;s largest yakuza organization, from 1946 to 1981.

==Early life==
Taoka, an orphan, grew up as a young street fighter in Kobe under the guidance of Noboru Yamaguchi, the Yamaguchi-gumi&#x27;s boss. He earned his lifelong nickname &quot;Kuma&quot; (&quot;the Bear&quot;) because of his signature attack of clawing at an opponent&#x27;s eyes.

==Career==
He was imprisoned for murder from 1937 to 1943 and assumed the role of &quot;kumicho&quot; three years later, at the age of 33. As World War II and the subsequent occupation of Japan wound down, however, more national focus would be given onto the internal criminal syndicates. Consequently, severe police crackdowns and arrests would be constantly imminent, making it a high cost venture for relatively low profit. Taoka realized that the economic activities in the back alleys would quickly come to a dead end, and a suggestion from a friend made Taoka start a full-fledged port cargo handling business instead.

In his time as boss, Taoka expanded the Yamaguchi-gumi from a small strikebreaking gang on the Kobe docks to the world&#x27;s largest criminal syndicate, with over 10,000 members during its peak. Notoriously suspicious and wary of rival yakuza clans, he notably refused to join the Kanto-kai, an inter-yakuza confederation in 1963. In 1972, following a period of tension between both gangs, Taoka forged an alliance between the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Inagawa-kai at a sakazuki ceremony at his home.

He had survived a 1978 assassination attempt when he was shot in the back of the neck by a member of the Matsuda-gumi (松田組), a rival gang to the Yamaguchi-gumi, during a limbo dance exhibition at a nightclub in Kyoto. His attacker was found dead several weeks later in the woods near Kobe.

==Death==
He led the Yamaguchi-gumi until his death from a heart attack in 1981. His wife, Fumiko, briefly filled the gang&#x27;s leadership role until a new &quot;kumicho&quot;, Masahisa Takenaka, was chosen in 1984.

==Personal life==
From 1983 to 1990, his daughter, Yuki (1964-), was married to Kitarō, a noted Japanese new-age musician. His son Mitsuru Taoka (1943–2012) was a producer of films in Japan and was married to actress Eiko Nakamura until her suicide at their home by gas poisoning in 1975.

<doc id="977567" wikidata="Q2980795" url="?curid=977567" title="Universal prescriptivism">
<text>Universal prescriptivism (often simply called prescriptivism) is the meta-ethical view that claims that, rather than expressing propositions, ethical sentences function similarly to imperatives which are universalizable—whoever makes a moral judgment is committed to the same judgment in any situation where the same relevant facts pertain.

This makes prescriptivism a universalist form of non-cognitivism. Prescriptivism stands in opposition to other forms of non-cognitivism (such as emotivism and quasi-realism), as well as to all forms of cognitivism (including both moral realism and ethical subjectivism).

Since prescriptivism was introduced by philosopher R. M. Hare in his 1952 book &quot;The Language of Morals&quot;, it has been compared to emotivism and to the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant. Unlike Kant, however, Hare does not invoke universalizability as a test of moral permissibility. Instead, he sees it as a consistency requirement that is built into the logic of moral language and helps to make moral thinking a rational enterprise.

==What prescriptivists claim==

Hare originally proposed prescriptivism as a kind of amendment to emotivism. Like emotivists, Hare believes that moral discourse is not primarily informative or fact-stating. But whereas emotivists claim that moral language is mainly intended to express feelings or to influence behavior, Hare believes that the central purpose of moral talk is to guide behavior by telling someone what to do. Its main purpose is to “prescribe” (recommend) a certain act, not to get someone to do that act or to express one&#x27;s personal feelings or attitudes.

To illustrate the prescriptivist view, consider the moral sentence, “Suicide is wrong.” According to moral realism, such a sentence claims there to be some objective property of “wrongness” associated with the act of suicide. According to some versions of emotivism, such a sentence merely expresses an attitude of the speaker; it only means something like “Boo on suicide!”, but according to prescriptivism, the statement “Suicide is wrong” means something more like “Do not commit suicide.”. What it expresses is thus not primarily a description or an emotion, but an &quot;imperative&quot;. General value terms like “good”, “bad”, “right”, “wrong” and “ought” usually also have descriptive and emotive meanings, but these are not their primary meanings according to prescriptivists.

==Criticisms==
Prescriptivism has faced extensive criticism and currently has few adherents. Ethicists commonly dispute Hare&#x27;s assertion that moral language lacks informativeness, challenging the idea that the primary purpose of moral discourse is not to convey moral truths or facts. Hare&#x27;s argument that offering guidance always constitutes the primary goal of moral discourse is also questioned by numerous critics.

Some critics observe that Hare seems to presume moral language is exclusively employed in discussions, debates, or commands, where one person instructs another or others on what to do. This perspective, it is argued, overlooks the broader usage of moral talk as a &quot;language-game&quot; serving diverse purposes. Lastly, critics contend that prescriptivism contradicts the common-sense differentiation between good and bad reasons for holding moral beliefs. 

Hare&#x27;s stance suggests that a racist &quot;fanatic&quot; advocating the deportation of all minority-group members, while maintaining consistency (even if the racist is a member of the minority group), cannot be criticized for either irrationality or falsehood. Kerner argues that, for Hare, morality fundamentally involves non-rational choice and commitment. However, critics of Hare argue that reason should and does play a more substantial role in ethics than he acknowledges.
