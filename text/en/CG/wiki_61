<text>Shtokavian or Štokavian (; / , ) is the prestige supradialect of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language and the basis of its Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin standards. It is a part of the South Slavic dialect continuum. Its name comes from the form for the interrogative pronoun for &quot;what&quot; (Western Shtokavian; it is in Eastern Shtokavian). This is in contrast to Kajkavian and Chakavian ( and also meaning &quot;what&quot;).

Shtokavian is spoken in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, much of Croatia, and the southern part of Austria&#x27;s Burgenland. The primary subdivisions of Shtokavian are based on three principles: one is different accents whether the subdialect is Old-Shtokavian or Neo-Shtokavian, second is the way the old Slavic phoneme &quot;jat&quot; has changed (Ikavian, Ijekavian or Ekavian), and third is presence of Young Proto-Slavic isogloss (Schakavian or Shtakavian). Modern dialectology generally recognises seven Shtokavian subdialects.

==Early history of Shtokavian==
The early medieval Slavs who later spoke various Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian dialects migrated across Moldavia and Pannonia. According to Frederik Kortlandt, the shared innovations originate from a &quot;Trans-Carpathian&quot; homeland, and by the 4th and 6th century, &quot;the major dialect divisions of Slavic were already established&quot;. Dialectologists and Slavists maintain that when the separation of Western South Slavic speeches happened, they separated into five divergent groups, more specifically two, one Slovene and a second Serbo-Croatian with four divergent groups - Kajkavian, Chakavian, Western Shtokavian and Eastern Shtokavian. The latter group can be additionally divided into a first (Kajkavian, Chakavian, Western Shtokavian) and second (Eastern Shtokavian, Torlakian). As noted by Ranko Matasović, &quot;the Shtokavian dialect, on the other hand, was from the earliest times very non-unique, with the Western Shtokavian dialects leaning towards Kajkavian, and the Eastern Shtokavian to Torlakian&quot;. According to isoglosses, and presumed end of existence of the common Southwestern Slavic language around the 8th-9th century, the formation of the Proto-Western Shtokavian and Proto-Eastern Shtokavian linguistic and territorial unit would be around the 9th-10th century (Proto-Western Shtokavian closer to Proto-Chakavian, while Proto-Eastern Shtokavian shared an old isogloss with Bulgarian). According to Ivo Banac in the area of today&#x27;s Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (west of Brčko, Vlasenica and Neretva line) and on the littoral between the Bay of Kotor and Cetina, medieval Croats spoke an old West Shtokavian dialect, which, some believe, stemmed from Chakavian, while medieval Serbs spoke two dialects, old East Shtokavian and Torlakian. Many linguists noted a close connection between Chakavian and Western Shtokavian, for example Pavle Ivić saw Chakavian as an archaic peripheral zone of Shtokavian, while Dalibor Brozović saw the majority of Chakavian dialects as derived from the same accentological core as Western Shtokavian. Western Shtokavian was principally characterized by a three-accent system, whereas Eastern Shtokavian was mostly marked by a two-accent system.

Western Shtokavian covered the major part of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slavonia and part of Southern Dalmatia in Croatia. Eastern Shtokavian was dominant in Serbia, easternmost Bosnia and Herzegovina and greater parts of Montenegro. From the 12th century, both dialects started separating further from Chakavian and Kajkavian idioms. According to research of historical linguistics, Old-Shtokavian was well established by the mid-15th century. In this period it was still mixed with Church Slavonic to varying degrees. However, the ultimate development of Western Shtokavian and Eastern Shtokavian was not divergent (like in the case of Chakavian and Kajkavian), but convergent. It was the result of migrations (particularly of Neoshtokavian-Eastern Shtokavian speakers), political-cultural border change and also caused by the Ottoman invasion (since the 16th century). Initially two separate proto-idioms started to resemble each other so greatly that, according to Brozović (1975), &quot;[today] we can no longer speak of an independent Western Shtokavian, but only about the better or weaker preservation of former West Shtokavian features in some dialects of the unique Shtokavian group of dialects&quot;.

As can be seen from the image on the right, originally the Shtokavian dialect covered a significantly smaller area than it covers today, meaning that the Shtokavian speech has spread for the last five centuries, overwhelmingly at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian idioms. The modern areal distribution of these three dialects as well as their internal stratification (Shtokavian and Chakavian in particular) is primarily a result of the migrations resulting from the spread of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Migratory waves were particularly strong in the 16th–18th century, bringing about large-scale linguistic and ethnic changes in the Central South Slavic area (see also Great Serb Migrations).

By far the most numerous, mobile and expansionist migrations were those of Ijekavian-Shtokavian speakers of eastern Herzegovina, who have spread into most of Western Serbia, many areas of eastern and western Bosnia, large swathes of Croatia (Banovina, Kordun, Lika, parts of Gorski kotar, continental parts of northern Dalmatia, some places north of Kupa, parts of Slavonia, southeastern Baranya etc.). This is the reason Eastern Herzegovinian is the most spoken Serbo-Croatian dialect today, and why its name is only descriptive of its area of origin. These migrations also played a pivotal role in the spread of Neo-Shtokavian innovations.

===Earliest texts of Shtokavian dialect===
Proto-Shtokavian, or Church Slavic with elements of nascent Shtokavian, were recorded in legal documents like the charter of Ban Kulin, regulating the commerce between Bosnia and Dubrovnik in Croatia, dated 1189, and in liturgical texts like Gršković&#x27;s and Mihanović&#x27;s fragments, , in southern Bosnia or Herzegovina. Experts&#x27; opinions are divided with regard to the extent these texts, especially the Kulin ban parchment, contain contemporary Shtokavian vernacular. Numerous legal and commercial documents from pre-Ottoman Bosnia, Hum, Serbia, Zeta, and southern Dalmatia, especially Dubrovnik are mainly Shtokavian, with elements of Church Slavic. The first major comprehensive vernacular Shtokavian text is the Vatican Croatian Prayer Book, written in Dubrovnik a decade or two before 1400. In the next two centuries Shtokavian vernacular texts had been written mainly in Dubrovnik, other Adriatic cities and islands influenced by Dubrovnik, as well as in Bosnia, by Bosnian Franciscans and Bosnian Muslim vernacular &quot;aljamiado&quot; literature – the first example being &quot;Chirvat-türkisi&quot; or &quot;Croatian song&quot;, dated 1589.

==Relationship towards neighboring dialects==
Shtokavian is characterized by a number of characteristic historical sound changes, accentual changes, changes in inflection, morphology and syntax. Some of these isoglosses are not exclusive and have also been shared by neighboring dialects, and some of them have mostly but not completely spread over the whole Shtokavian area. The differences between Shtokavian and the unrelated, neighboring Bulgarian–Macedonian dialects are mostly clear-cut, whereas the differences with the related Serbo-Croatian dialects of Chakavian and Kajkavian are much more fluid, and the mutual influence of various subdialects plays a more prominent role.

The main bundle of isoglosses separates Slovenian and Kajkavian on the one hand from Shtokavian and Chakavian on the other. These are:
# long falling accent of newer origin (neocircumflex)
# development of the consonant group &quot;rj&quot; (as opposed to consonant &quot;/r/&quot;) from former soft &quot;/r&#x27;/&quot; before a vowel (e.g., , )
# reflexes of &quot;/o/&quot; or &quot;/ọ/&quot; of the old Common Slavic nasal vowel &quot;/ǫ/&quot;, and not &quot;/u/&quot;
# inflectional morpheme &quot;-o&quot; (as opposed to &quot;-ojo&quot;) in the instrumental singular of a-declension

Other characteristics distinguishing Kajkavian from Shtokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun &quot;kaj&quot; (as opposed to &quot;što/šta&quot; used in Shtokavian), are:
# a reflex of old semivowels of &quot;/ẹ/&quot; (e.g. &quot;dẹn&quot; &lt; Common Slavic *dьnь, &quot;pẹs&quot; &lt; Common Slavic *pьsъ); closed &quot;/ẹ/&quot; appearing also as a &quot;jat&quot; reflex
# retention of word-final &quot;-l&quot; (e.g. , as opposed to Shtokavian &quot;došao&quot;)
# word-initial &quot;u-&quot; becoming &quot;v-&quot; (e.g. , , )
# dephonemicization of affricates /č/ and /ć/ to some form of middle value
# genitive plural of masculine nouns has the morpheme &quot;-of&quot; / &quot;-ef&quot;
# syncretized dative, locative and instrumental plural has the ending &quot;-ami&quot;
# the ending &quot;-me&quot; in the first-person plural present (e.g. &quot;vidime&quot;)
# affix &quot;š&quot; in the formation of adjectival comparatives (e.g. &quot;debleši&quot;, &quot;slabeši&quot;)
# supine
# future tense formation in the form of &quot;bom/bum došel, došla, došlo&quot;

Characteristics distinguishing Chakavian from Shtokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun &quot;ča&quot;, are:
# preservation of polytonic three-accent system
# vocalization of weak jers in word-initial syllables (e.g. &quot;malin/melin&quot; &lt; Common Slavic *mъlinъ; cf. Shtokavian &quot;mlin&quot;)
# vowel &quot;/a/&quot; as opposed to &quot;/e/&quot; after palatal consonants &quot;/j/&quot;, &quot;/č/&quot;, &quot;/ž/&quot; (e.g. Čk. &quot;jazik/zajik&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;, Čk. &quot;počati&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;, Čk. &quot;žaja&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;)
# the appearance of extremely palatal &quot;/t&#x27;/&quot; or &quot;/ć&#x27;/&quot; (&lt; earlier &quot;/t&#x27;/&quot;) and &quot;/j/&quot; (&lt; earlier &quot;/d&#x27;/&quot;) either in free positions or in groups &quot;št&#x27;&quot;, &quot;žd&#x27;&quot;
# depalatalization of &quot;/n&#x27;/&quot; and &quot;/l&#x27;/&quot;
# &quot;/ž/&quot; instead of &quot;/dʒ/&quot; (c.f. Čk. &quot;žep&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;)
# &quot;/č/&quot; &gt; &quot;/š/&quot; before consonants (c.f. Čk. &quot;maška&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;)
# word-initial consonant groups &quot;čr-&quot;, &quot;čri-&quot;, &quot;čre-&quot; (c.f. Čk. &quot;črivo/črevo&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;, Čk. &quot;črn&quot; : Št. &quot;&quot;)
# conditional mood with &quot;biš&quot; in the second-person singular
# non-syncretized dative, locative and instrumental plural

==General characteristics==
General characteristics of Shtokavian are the following:

# &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; as the demonstrative/interrogative pronoun
# differentiation between two short (in addition to two or three long) accents, rising and falling, though not in all Shtokavian speakers
# preservation of unaccented length, but not consistently across all speeches
# &quot;/u/&quot; as the reflex of Common Slavic back nasal vowel &quot;/ǫ/&quot; as well as the syllabic &quot;/l/&quot; (with the exception of central Bosnia where a diphthongal &quot;/uo/&quot; is also recorded as a reflex)
# initial group of &quot;v-&quot; + weak semivowel yields &quot;u-&quot; (e.g. &quot;&quot; &lt; Common Slavic *vъnukъ)
# schwa resulting from the &quot;jer&quot; merger yields &quot;/a/&quot;, with the exception of the Zeta-Raška dialect
# metathesis of &quot;vьse&quot; to &quot;sve&quot;
# &quot;čr-&quot; &gt; &quot;cr-&quot;, with the exception of Slavonian, Molise and Vlah oasis-Burgenland dialect
# word-final &quot;-l&quot; changes to &quot;/o/&quot; or &quot;/a/&quot;; the exception is the verbal adjective in the Slavonian southwest
# &quot;ď&quot; &gt; /dʑ/ with numerous exceptions
# &quot;cr&quot; &gt; &quot;tr&quot; in the word &quot;&quot; &quot;cherry&quot;; some exceptions in Slavonia, Hungary and Romania
# &quot;ć&quot; and &quot;đ&quot; from &quot;jt&quot;, &quot;jd&quot; (e.g. &quot;&quot;, &quot;pođem&quot;); exceptions in Slavonian and Eastern Bosnian dialect
# so-called &quot;new iotation&quot; of dentals and labials, with many exceptions, especially in Slavonia and Bosnia
# general loss of phoneme &quot;/x/&quot;, with many exceptions
# ending &quot;-ā&quot; in genitive plural of masculine and feminine nouns, with many exceptions
# ending &quot;-u&quot; in locative singular of masculine and neuter nouns (e.g. , )
# augment &quot;-ov-&quot; / &quot;-ev-&quot; in the plural of most monosyllabic masculine nouns, with many exceptions (e.g. in the area between Neretva and Dubrovnik)
# syncretism of dative, locative and instrumental plural of nouns, with many exceptions
# preservation of ending in genitive and accusative singular of masculine and neuter gender if pronominal-adjectival declension (e.g., ), with exceptions on the area of Dubrovnik and Livno
# special form with the ending &quot;-a&quot; for the neuter gender in nominative plural of pronominal-adjectival declension (e.g. and no )
# preservation of aorist, which is however missing in some areas (e.g., around Dubrovnik)
# special constructs reflecting old dual for numerals 2–4 ()
# many so-called &quot;Turkisms&quot; () or &quot;Orientalisms&quot;, i.e. words borrowed from Ottoman Turkish

As can be seen from the list, many of these isoglosses are missing from particular Shtokavian idioms, just as many of them are shared with neighboring non-Shtokavian dialects.

There exist three main criteria for the division of Shtokavian dialects:
# Accentuation (&quot;Old-Shtokavian&quot; and &quot;Neo-Shtokavian&quot;; see section below)
# Yat reflex (&quot;Ikavian&quot;, &quot;Ijekavian&quot;, &quot;Ekavian&quot;; see section below)
# Young Proto-Slavic (600–750 AD) palatal consonant isogloss: &quot;*šć&quot;-&quot;*žƷ&quot; ( - Schakavian; &quot;Western Shtokavian&quot; including Slavonian, Eastern Bosnian and transitory Western ikavian dialect) and &quot;*št&quot; &amp; &quot;*žd&quot; ( - Shtakavian; &quot;Eastern Shtokavian&quot; including Eastern Herzegovinian-Krajina, Šumadija-Vojvodina, Kosovo-Resava, Zeta-Raška dialect). The isogloss developed between 7th and 8/9th century, and the former relates those dialects with Chakavian and Kajkavian, while the latter relates those dialects with Bulgarian.

==Accentuation== 
The Shtokavian dialect is divided into Old-Shtokavian and Neo-Shtokavian subdialects. The primary distinction is the accentuation system: although there are variations, &quot;old&quot; dialects preserve the older accent system, which consists of two types of falling (dynamic) accents, one long and one short, and unstressed syllables, which can be long and short. Both long and short unstressed syllables could precede the stressed syllables. Stress placement is free and mobile in paradigms.

In the process known as &quot;Neo-Shtokavian metatony&quot; or &quot;retraction&quot;, length of the old syllables was preserved, but their quality changed. Stress (intensity) on the inner syllables moved to the preceding syllable, but they kept the high pitch. That process produced the &quot;rising&quot; accents characteristic for Neo-Shtokavian, and yielded the modern four-tone system. Stress on the initial syllables remained the same in quality and pitch.

Most speakers of Shtokavian, native or taught, from Serbia and Croatia do not distinguish between short rising and short falling tones. They also pronounce most unstressed long vowels as short, with some exceptions, such as genitive plural endings.

The following notation is used for Shtokavian accents:
The following table shows the examples of Neo-Shtokavian retraction:

As result of this process, the following set of rules emerged, which are still in effect in all standard variants of Serbo-Croatian:
* Falling accents may only occur word-initially (otherwise it would have been retracted).
* Rising accents may occur anywhere except word-finally.
** thus, monosyllabic words may only have falling accent.
* Unstressed length may only appear after a stressed syllable.

In practice, influx of foreign words and formation of compound words have loosened these rules, especially in spoken idioms (e.g. &quot;paradȁjz&quot;, &quot;asistȅnt&quot;, &quot;poljoprȉvreda&quot;), but they are maintained in standard language and dictionaries.

==Classification==
===Old-Shtokavian dialects===

====Prizren–Timok (Torlakian)====

The transitional dialects stretch southwest from the Timok Valley near the Bulgarian border to Prizren. There is disagreement among linguists whether these dialects belong to the Shtokavian area, because there are many other morphological characteristics apart from rendering of &quot;što&quot; (also, some dialects use &quot;kakvo&quot; or &quot;kvo&quot;, typical for Bulgarian), which would place them into a &quot;transitional&quot; group between Shtokavian and Eastern South Slavic languages (Bulgarian and Macedonian). The Timok-Prizren group falls to the Balkan language area: declension has all but disappeared, the infinitive has yielded to subjunctives &quot;da&quot;-constructions, and adjectives are compared exclusively with prefixes. The accent in the dialect group is a stress accent, and it falls on any syllable in the word. The old semi-vowel has been retained throughout. The vocalic &quot;l&quot; has been retained (&quot;vlk&quot; = &quot;vuk&quot;), and some dialects don&#x27;t distinguish &quot;ć/č&quot; and &quot;đ/dž&quot; by preferring the latter, postalveolar variants. Some subdialects preserve &quot;l&quot; at the end of words (where otherwise it has developed into a short o) – &quot;došl&quot;, &quot;znal&quot;, etc. (cf. Kajkavian and Bulgarian); in others, this &quot;l&quot; has become the syllable &quot;ja&quot;.

Torlakian is spoken in Metohija, around Prizren, Gnjilane and Štrpce especially, in Southern Serbia around Bujanovac, Vranje, Leskovac, Niš, Aleksinac, in the part of Toplica Valley around Prokuplje, in Eastern Serbia around Pirot, Svrljig, Soko Banja, Boljevac, Knjaževac ending up with the area around Zaječar, where the Kosovo-Resava dialect becomes more dominant. It has been recorded several exclaves with Torlakian speeches inside Kosovo-Resava dialect area. One is the most prominent and preserved, like village Dublje near Svilajnac, where the majority of settlers came from Torlakian speaking village Veliki Izvor near Zaječar. Few centuries ago, before settlers from Kosovo and Metohija brought Kosovo-Resava speeches to Eastern Serbia (to Bor and Negotin area), Torlakian speech had been overwhelmingly represented in this region.

====Slavonian====

Also called the &quot;Archaic Šćakavian&quot;, it is spoken by Croats who live in some parts of Slavonia, Bačka, Baranja, Syrmia, in Croatia and Vojvodina, as well as in northern Bosnia. It is divided into two subdialects: southern (Posavian / &quot;posavski&quot;) and northern (Podravian / &quot;podravski&quot;). The Slavonian dialect has mixed Ikavian and Ekavian pronunciations. Ikavian accent is predominant in the Posavina, Baranja, Bačka, and in the Slavonian subdialect enclave of Derventa, whereas Ekavian accent is predominant in Podravina. There are enclaves of one accent in the territory of the other, as well as mixed Ekavian–Ikavian and Jekavian–Ikavian areas. In some villages in Hungary, the original &quot;yat&quot; is preserved. Local variants can widely differ in the degree of Neo-Shtokavian influences. In two villages in Posavina, Siče and Magića Male, the &quot;l&quot;, as in the verb &quot;nosil&quot;, has been retained in place of the modern &quot;nosio&quot;. In some villages in the Podravina, &quot;čr&quot; is preserved instead of the usual &quot;cr&quot;, for example in &quot;črn&quot; instead of &quot;crn&quot;. Both forms are usual in Kajkavian but very rare in Shtokavian.

====Eastern Bosnian====
Also called &quot;Jekavian-Šćakavian&quot;, Eastern Bosnian dialect has Jekavian pronunciations in the vast majority of local forms and it is spoken by the majority of Bosniaks living in that area, which includes the bigger Bosnian cities Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zenica, and by most of Croats and Serbs that live in that area (Vareš, Usora, etc.). Together with basic Jekavian pronunciation, mixed pronunciations exist in Tešanj and Maglaj &quot;dete–djeteta&quot; (Ekavian–Jekavian) and around Žepče and Jablanica &quot;djete–diteta&quot; (Jekavian–ikavian). In the central area of the subdialect, the diphthong &quot;uo&quot; exists in some words instead of the archaic &quot;l&quot; and more common &quot;u&quot; like &quot;vuok&quot; or , instead of the standard modern &quot;vuk&quot; and &quot;stup&quot;.

====Zeta–Raška====

Also known as &quot;Đekavian-Ijekavian&quot;, it is spoken in eastern Montenegro, in Podgorica and Cetinje, around the city of Novi Pazar in eastern Raška in Serbia, and by descendants of Montenegrin settlers in the single village of Peroj in Istria. The majority of its speakers are Serbs and Montenegrins and Muslims from Serbia and Montenegro. Together with the dominant Jekavian pronunciation, mixed pronunciations like &quot;djete–deteta&quot; (Jekavian–Ekavian) around Novi Pazar and Bijelo Polje, &quot;dite–đeteta&quot; (Ikavian–Jekavian) around Podgorica and &quot;dete–đeteta&quot; (Ekavian–Jekavian) in the village of Mrkojevići in southern Montenegro. Mrkojevići are also characterised by retention of &quot;čr&quot; instead of &quot;cr&quot; as in the previously mentioned villages in Podravina.

Some vernaculars have a very open /ɛ/ or /æ/ as their reflex of ь/ъ, very rare in other Shtokavian vernaculars (&quot;sæn&quot; and &quot;dæn&quot; instead of &quot;san&quot; and &quot;dan&quot;). Other phonetic features include sounds like in &quot;iʑesti&quot; instead of &quot;izjesti&quot;, as in &quot;ɕekira&quot; instead of &quot;sjekira&quot;. However these sounds are known also to many in East Herzegovina like those in Konavle, and are not Zeta–Raška specific . There is a loss of the /v/ sound apparent, seen in &quot;čo&#x27;ek&quot; or &quot;đa&#x27;ola&quot;. The loss of distinction between /ʎ/ and /l/ in some vernaculars is based on a substratum. The word is a hypercorrection (instead of ) because many vernaculars have changed lj to j.

All verbs in infinitive finish with &quot;t&quot; (example: &#x27;sing&#x27;). This feature is also present in most vernaculars of East Herzegovinian, and actually almost all Serbian and Croatian vernaculars.

The group &quot;a + o&quot; gave &quot;ā&quot; /aː/ (&quot;kā&quot; instead of &quot;kao&quot;, &quot;rekā&quot; for &quot;rekao&quot;), like in other seaside vernaculars. Elsewhere, more common is &quot;ao&quot; &gt; &quot;ō&quot;.

====Kosovo–Resava====
Also called &quot;Older Ekavian&quot;, is spoken by Serbs, mostly in western and northeastern Kosovo (Kosovo Valley with Kosovska Mitrovica and also around Peć), in Ibar Valley with Kraljevo, around Kruševac, Trstenik and in Župa, in the part of Toplica Valley (Kuršumlija) in the Morava Valley (Jagodina, Ćuprija, Paraćin, Lapovo), in Resava Valley (Svilajnac, Despotovac) and northeastern Serbia (Smederevo, Požarevac, Bor, Majdanpek, Negotin, Velika Plana) with one part of Banat (around Kovin, Bela Crkva and Vršac). This dialect can be also found in parts of Banatska Klisura (Clisura Dunării) in Romania, in places where Romanian Serbs live (left bank of the Danube).

Substitution of &quot;jat&quot; is predominantly Ekavian accent even on the end of datives (&quot;žene&quot; instead of &quot;ženi&quot;), in pronouns (&quot;teh&quot; instead of &quot;tih&quot;), in comparatives (&quot;dobrej&quot; instead of ) in the negative of biti (&quot;nesam&quot; instead of &quot;nisam&quot;); in Smederevo–Vršac dialects, Ikavian forms can be found (&quot;di si&quot; instead of &quot;gde si?&quot;). Smederevo–Vršac dialect (spoken in northeastern Šumadija, Lower Great Morava Valley and Banat) is sometimes classified as a subdialect of the Kosovo-Resava dialect but is also considered to be a separate dialect as it the represents mixed speech of Šumadija–Vojvodina and Kosovo–Resava dialects.

===Neo-Shtokavian dialects===

====Bosnian–Dalmatian====
Also called &quot;Western Ikavian&quot;. The majority of its speakers are Croats who live in Lika, Kvarner, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, and of north Bačka around Subotica in Serbia and south Bács-Kiskun of Hungary, and in Molise in Italy. The minority speakers of it include Bosniaks in western Bosnia, mostly around the city of Bihać, and also in central Bosnia where Croats and Bosniaks (e.g. Travnik, Jajce, Bugojno, Vitez) used to speak this dialect. Exclusively Ikavian accent, Bosnian and Herzegovinian forms use &quot;o&quot; in verb participle, whereas those in Dalmatia and Lika use &quot;-ija&quot; or &quot;ia&quot; like in &quot;vidija/vidia&quot;. Local form of Bačka was proposed as the base for the Danubian branch of the Bunjevac dialect of Bunjevac Croats (Bunjevci) in Vojvodina, Serbia.

====Šumadija–Vojvodina====

Also known as &quot;Younger Ekavian&quot;, is one of the bases for the standard Serbian language. It is spoken by Serbs across most of Vojvodina (excluding easternmost parts around Vršac), northern part of western Serbia, around Kragujevac and Valjevo in Šumadija, in Mačva around Šabac and Bogatić, in Belgrade and in predominantly ethnically Serbian villages in eastern Croatia around the town of Vukovar. It is predominately Ekavian (Ikavian forms are of morphophonological origin). In some parts of Vojvodina the old declension is preserved. Most Vojvodina dialects and some dialects in Šumadija have an open &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. However the vernaculars of western Serbia, and in past to them connected vernaculars of (old) Belgrade and southwestern Banat (Borča, Pančevo, Bavanište) are as close to the standard as a vernacular can be. The dialect presents a base for the Ekavian variant of the Serbian standard language.

====Eastern Herzegovinian====

Also called &quot;Eastern Herzegovinian&quot; or &quot;Neo-Ijekavian&quot;. It encompasses by far the largest area and the number of speakers of all Shtokavian dialects. It is the dialectal basis of the standard literary Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, and Montenegrin languages.

A specific idiom which is often grouped with Eastern Heryegovinian is Dubrovnik subdialect. Also known as &quot;Western Ijekavian&quot;, in earlier centuries, this subdialect was an independent subdialect of Western Shtokavian dialect. After migrations and Neo-Shtokavisation, it preserved features (like accent, vowels, morphology etc.) which are different to Eastern Herzegovinian. It has a mixed Shtokavian and Chakavian vocabulary, with some words from Dalmatian, older Venetian and modern Italian.

Micro groups:
* western Montenegro – spoken south Ijekavian variant.
* Croats western Ijekavian variant micro groups in region Slavonia, Banovina, Kordun, Žumberak, Neretva, East Herzegovina (Ravno, Stolac, Buna, Neum), around of region Dubrovnik, and is the basis of the Croatian standard. City: (Osijek, Bjelovar, Daruvar, Sisak, Pakrac, Petrinja, Dubrovnik, Metković).
* Serbs east Ijekavian variant groups; East Bosnia, East Herzegovina (Trebinje, Nevesinje, Bileća), Bosnian Krajina, western Serbia and Podrinje (Užice, Čačak, Ivanjica, Loznica, Priboj, Prijepolje ) and minority Croatian Serbs. City: Trebinje, Bijeljina, Banja Luka, Nevesinje, Pale.
* Its south-eastern form is characterised by the total lack of sound that is sometimes not only left out or replaced by more common or but is replaced as well by less common and (, imperfect of verb &quot;biti&quot;). Local forms in the Žumberak enclave and around Dubrovnik or Slunj have some special Croatian features, influenced from Chakavian and the western subdialect, whereas forms in Bjelovar or Pakrac are influenced from Kajkavian.

==Yat reflexes==

The Proto-Slavic vowel &quot;jat&quot; (ѣ in Cyrillic or ě in Latin)
has changed over time, coming to be pronounced differently in different areas. These different reflexes define three &quot;pronunciations&quot; () of Shtokavian:
* In Ekavian pronunciation (&quot;ekavski&quot; ), &quot;jat&quot; has conflated into the vowel &quot;e&quot;
* in Ikavian pronunciation (&quot;ikavski&quot; ), it has conflated into the vowel &quot;i&quot;
* in Ijekavian or Jekavian pronunciation (&quot;ijekavski&quot; or &quot;jekavski&quot; ), it has come to be pronounced &quot;ije&quot; or &quot;je&quot;, depending on whether the vowel was long or short. In standard Croatian, pronunciation is always Jekavian: when yat is short then it is (written as &quot;je&quot;), and when yat is long then it is (written as &quot;ije&quot;).

Historically, the yat reflexes had been inscribed in Church Slavic texts before the significant development of Shtokavian dialect, reflecting the beginnings of the formative period of the vernacular. In early documents it is predominantly Church Slavic of the Serbian or Croatian &quot;recension&quot; (variant). The first undoubted Ekavian reflex ( &#x27;it was&#x27;) is found in a document from Serbia dated 1289; the first Ikavian reflex ( &#x27;witnesses&#x27;) in Bosnia in 1331; and first Ijekavian reflex ( &#x27;we wish&#x27;, a &quot;hyper-Ijekavism&quot;) in Croatia in 1399. Partial attestation can be found in earlier texts (for instance, Ikavian pronunciation is found in a few Bosnian documents from the latter half of the 13th century), but philologists generally accept the aforementioned dates. In the second half of the 20th century, many vernaculars with unsubstituted yat are found. The intrusion of the vernacular into Church Slavic grew in time, to be finally replaced by the vernacular idiom. This process took place for Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks independently and without mutual interference until the mid-19th century. Historical linguistics, textual analysis and dialectology have dispelled myths about allegedly &quot;unspoilt&quot; vernacular speech of rural areas: for instance, it is established that Bosniaks have retained phoneme &quot;h&quot; in numerous words (unlike Serbs and Croats), due to elementary religious education based on the Quran, where this phoneme is the carrier of specific semantic value.

The Ekavian pronunciation, sometimes called Eastern, is spoken primarily in Serbia, and in small parts of Croatia. The Ikavian pronunciation, sometimes called Western, is spoken in western and central Bosnia, western Herzegovina, some of Slavonia and the major part of Dalmatia in Croatia. The Ijekavian pronunciation, sometimes called Southern, is spoken in central Croatia, most of Slavonia, southern Dalmatia, most of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, as well as some parts of western Serbia. The following are some generic examples:
Long &quot;ije&quot; is pronounced as a single syllable, , by many Ijekavian speakers, especially in Croatia. However, in Zeta dialect and most of East Herzegovina dialect, it is pronounced as two syllables, , which is the Croatian official standard too, but seldom actually practiced. This distinction can be clearly heard in first verses of national anthems of Croatia and Montenegro—they&#x27;re sung as &quot;&quot;L&#x27;je-pa [two syllables] na-ša do-mo-vi-no&quot; and &quot;Oj svi-je-tla [three syllables] maj-ska zo-ro&quot;&quot; respectively.

The Ikavian pronunciation is the only one that is not part of any standard variety of Serbo-Croatian today, though it was a variant used for a significant literary output between the 15th and 18th centuries. This has led to a reduction in its use and an increase in the use of Ijekavian in traditionally Ikavian areas since the standardization. For example, most people in formerly fully Ikavian Split, Croatia today use both Ikavian and Ijekavian words in everyday speech, without a clearly predictable pattern (usually more emotionally charged or intimate words are Ikavian and more academic, political, generally standardised words Ijekavian, but it is not a straight out rule).

The IETF language tags have assigned the variants and to Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations, respectively.

==Ethnic affiliation of native speakers of Shtokavian dialect==
During the first half of the 19th century, protagonists of nascent Slavic philology were, as far as South Slavic dialects were concerned, embroiled in frequently bitter polemic about &quot;ethnic affiliation&quot; of native speakers of various dialects. This, from contemporary point of view, rather bizarre obsession was motivated primarily by political and national interests that prompted philologists-turned-ideologues to express their views on the subject. The most prominent contenders in the squabble, with conflicting agenda, were the Czech philologist Josef Dobrovský, the Slovak Pavel Šafárik, the Slovenes Jernej Kopitar and Franz Miklosich, the Serb Vuk Karadžić, the Croat of Slovak origin Bogoslav Šulek, and the Croatians Vatroslav Jagić and Ante Starčević.

The dispute was primarily concerned with who can, philologically, be labelled as &quot;Slovene&quot;, &quot;Croat&quot; and &quot;Serb&quot; with the aim of expanding one&#x27;s national territory and influence. Born in the climate of romanticism and national awakening, these polemical battles led to increased tensions between the aforementioned nations, especially because the Shtokavian dialect cannot be split along ethnic lines in an unequivocal manner.

However, contemporary native speakers, after process of national crystallization and identification had been completed, can be roughly identified as predominant speakers of various Shtokavian subdialects. Because standard languages propagated through media have strongly influenced and altered the situation in the 19th century, the following attribution must be treated with necessary caution.

The distribution of Old-Shtokavian speakers along ethnic lines in present times is as follows:
* Timok-Prizren (Ekavian accent) dialect: Serbian
* Kosovo-Resava (Ekavian accent) dialect: Serbian
* Zeta-Raška dialect (Ijekavian accent): Montenegrin, Bosniak and Serbian.
* Slavonian dialect (fluctuating &quot;yat&quot;: mainly Ikavian accent, also Ijekavian and Ekavian): vastly Croatian
* Eastern Bosnian dialect (Ijekavian accent): Bosniak and Croatian

Generally, the Neo-Shtokavian dialect is divided as follows with regard to the ethnicity of its native speakers:
* Šumadija-Vojvodina dialect (Ekavian accent): Serbian
* Dalmatian-Bosnian dialect (Ikavian accent): Croatian and Bosniak
* Eastern Herzegovinian (Ijekavian accent): Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian and Bosniak

==Standard language==
The standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language are all based on the Neo-Shtokavian dialect as it was formalized in SFR Yugoslavia.

However, it must be stressed that standard variants, irrespectively of their mutual differences, have been stylised in such manners that parts of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect have been retained—for instance, declension—but other features were purposely omitted or altered—for instance, the phoneme &quot;h&quot; was reinstated in the standard language.

Croatian has had a long tradition of Shtokavian vernacular literacy and literature. It took almost four and half centuries for Shtokavian to prevail as the dialectal basis for the Croatian standard. In other periods, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects, as well as hybrid Chakavian–Kajkavian–Shtokavian interdialects &quot;contended&quot; for the Croatian national koine – but eventually lost, mainly due to historical and political reasons. By the 1650s it was fairly obvious that Shtokavian would become the dialectal basis for the Croatian standard, but this process was finally completed in the 1850s, when Neo-Shtokavian Ijekavian, based mainly on Ragusan (Dubrovnik), Dalmatian, Bosnian, and Slavonian literary heritage became the national standard language.

Serbian was much faster in standardisation. Although vernacular literature was present in the 18th century, it was Vuk Karadžić who, between 1818 and 1851, made a radical break with the past and established Serbian Neo-Shtokavian folklore idiom as the basis of standard Serbian (until then, educated Serbs had been using Serbian Slavic, Russian Slavic and hybrid Russian–Serbian language). Although he wrote in Serbian Ijekavian accent, the majority of Serbs have adopted Ekavian accent, which is dominant in Serbia. Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, as well as Montenegrins, use the Ijekavian accent.

Bosnian is only currently beginning to take shape. The Bosniak idiom can be seen as a transition between Serbian Ijekavian and Croatian varieties, with some specific traits. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, Bosniaks affirmed their wish to stylize their own standard language, based on the Neo-Shtokavian dialect, but reflecting their characteristics—from phonetics to semantics.

Also, the contemporary situation is unstable with regard to the accentuation, because phoneticians have observed that the 4-accents speech has, in all likelihood, shown to be increasingly unstable, which resulted in proposals that a 3-accents norm be prescribed. This is particularly true for Croatian, where, contrary to all expectations, the influence of Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects on the standard language has been waxing, not waning, in the past 50–70 years.

The Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian standard variants, although all based on the East Herzegovinian subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian and mutually intelligible, do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages (English, Spanish, German and Portuguese, among others), but not to a degree which would justify considering them as different languages. Their structures are grammatically and phonologically almost identical, but have differences in vocabulary and semantics: &quot;Lexical differences between the ethnic variants are extremely limited, even when compared with those between closely related Slavic languages (such as standard Czech and Slovak, Bulgarian and Macedonian), and grammatical differences are even less pronounced. More importantly, complete understanding between the ethnic variants of the standard language makes translation and second language teaching impossible.&quot; See Differences between standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian.

In 2017, numerous prominent writers, scientists, journalists, activists and other public figures from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia signed the Declaration on the Common Language, which states that in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro a common polycentric standard language is used, consisting of several standard varieties, similar to the situation in German, English, or Spanish.

<text>Eggborough is a village and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England, close to the county borders with South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the East Riding.

The village is situated at the junction of the A19 and the A645, approximately east of Pontefract and south-west of Selby. It is also close to the M62.

==History==
Eggborough (as well as High and Low Eggborough) is mentioned in Domesday Book of 1086 and was formerly in the Wapentake of Osgoldcross. The name derives from &quot;Ecga&#x27;s Burh&quot;, a fortification belonging to a person named &quot;Ecga&quot;.

Eggborough was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1 April 1974, when it became part of the Selby District of North Yorkshire. On 1 April 2023 Selby District was abolished and Eggborough became part of the new North Yorkshire unitary authority area.
There is a pub in the village, the Horse and Jockey. There is a cricket club, which was formed in 1902 just up from the Horse &amp; Jockey and is the home of Whitley Bridge Cricket Club. There is also a sports and leisure complex in the grounds of the nearby Eggborough Power Station. The complex offers a nine-hole golf course, two miniature football pitches, two full-size football pitches, a bowling green, a children&#x27;s play area, a miniature railway, a licensed bar, snooker, pool, a green room and a concert hall.

The centre of the village used to be the location of a Bowman&#x27;s Flour Mill, but it ceased production in 2016.

Close to Eggborough is the site of French-owned Saint-Gobain Glass, Europe&#x27;s leading producer of float (flat) glass. The plant, which opened in 1998, employs over 170 people and produces of flat glass per year.

The large village hall on Selby Road is well used and is shared with the residents of Whitley Bridge, which has no village hall of its own. Other activities take place at the Methodist Hall and the Westfield Centre.
The village also has its own football team, Eggborough Eagles, which is based at the Eggborough Sports and Leisure Complex. The Eggborough Eagles were founded in 2011 by Chairman James Lancaster, Secretary Michael Corr and Manager Michael Shaughnessy. They came fourth in their first-ever season recognised in the Selby and District Invitational League.

===Power stations===
The village was the site of the coal-fired Eggborough Power Station, built in the 1960s and once owned by British Energy. Its four turbines could produce a total combined output of 1,960 MWe. The power station was due to be closed in 2016, but won a reprieve as a backup generator of power until March 2017 and then again until March 2018, when it shut down for good. The current owners are applying for permission to convert the power station to a gas-fired power plant.

There was also a short lived biomass power station, ARBRE Power Station, built by the Kelda Group, owners of Yorkshire Water, which cost £30 million. The site was developed to burn willow wood grown by local farmers and turn it into gas, however, by August 2002 had gone into liquidation. The capacity of the station was rated at 8 MW. In 2015, DRENL (UK) gained approval to convert the old ARBRE site into an Energy from waste (EfW) plant that would process of waste per year to generate 10 MW of electricity.

==Transport==
The A19 and the A645 intersect in the village, with the A19 being on a north–south axis and having a junction (number 34) on the M62 just south of the village. To the south of the village lies the Aire and Calder Navigation. Eggborough is served by railway station on the Pontefract line, but services are limited to just two trains a day to and only one through to .

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. It stretches north to West Haddlesey and has a total population of 3,763.

It has a parish council consisting of four members. Eggborough was represented on the former Selby District Council by husband-and-wife couple John and Mary McCartney, who are Independents. John is also the North Yorkshire County Councillor for the ward, which includes Eggborough.

==Education==
Primary-age children attend Whitley and Eggborough Primary School, in Learning Lane on the other side of the M62.

<text>Martin &quot;Mike&quot; Sennet Conner (August 31, 1891 – September 16, 1950), was an American politician, lawyer, and college sports administrator who served as the governor of Mississippi from 1932 to 1936.

==Early life and education==
Martin Conner was born in Forrest County, Mississippi in August 1891 to Oscar Weir (1868-1923) and Holly Gertrude (née Sennett) Conner (1871-1937). In 1900, his family moved to rural Seminary in Covington County in southern Mississippi, where Conner likely obtained his high school education at the Seminary Attendance Center (now Seminary High School).

Conner began his education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford at the age of 14 years, likely the youngest person to attend the university along with Enoch Starnes. He continued his education at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, after which he began a legal career in Seminary.

== Political career ==
Conner served as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1916 to 1924, and served a stint as Speaker of the House. In 1932, Conner was elected Governor of Mississippi.

Conner was allied with Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and the U.S. senator from 1932 to 1935. Long struck up an alliance with Conner to support &quot;good roads&quot; connecting the neighboring states. From the sidelines, Long helped Conner win the Mississippi governorship though Conner had twice lost previous bid for the office. Conner&#x27;s runoff election opponent and gubernatorial successor, Hugh L. White, tried to make an issue of Long&#x27;s involvement in an out-of-state race.

Conner&#x27;s term as a governor corresponded with the Great Depression, but he maintained a state treasury surplus during his tenure. He was noted for going to the state penitentiary to preside over &quot;mercy courts&quot; that resulted in executive clemency for prisoners. One of Conner&#x27;s methods by which he orchestrated a positive $16 million swing in the state&#x27;s finances (in only four years) was the introduction of a state sales tax.

In 1936, Conner ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Pat Harrison. He received the support of U.S. Senator Theodore Bilbo. Harrison ultimately won the election.

== Life after politics ==
Following his term as governor, Conner was the first commissioner of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) from August 21, 1940 through the fall of 1946. Conner died in the capital city of Jackson and is interred there at Lakewood Memorial Park.

<doc id="993313" wikidata="Q838165" url="?curid=993313" title="Kajkavian">
<text>Kajkavian is a South Slavic supradialect or language spoken primarily by Croats in much of Central Croatia and Gorski Kotar.

It is part of the South Slavic dialect continuum, being transitional to the supradialects of Čakavian, Štokavian and the Slovene language. There are differing opinions over whether Kajkavian is best considered a dialect of the Serbo-Croatian language or a fully-fledged language of its own, as it is only partially mutually intelligible with either Čakavian or Štokavian and bears more similarities to Slovene; it is transitional to and fully mutually intelligible with Prekmurje Slovene and the dialects in Slovenian Lower Styria&#x27;s region of Prlekija in terms of phonology and vocabulary.

Outside Croatia&#x27;s northernmost regions, Kajkavian is also spoken in Austrian Burgenland and a number of enclaves in Hungary along the Austrian and Croatian border and in Romania.

== Name ==
The term &quot;Kajkavian&quot; and the broader classification of what defines this dialect are relatively modern constructs. The dialect&#x27;s name originates from the interrogative pronoun &quot;kaj&quot; (&quot;what&quot;). The names of the other supradialects of Serbo-Croatian also originate from their respective variants of the interrogative pronoun. The pronouns are just general indicators and not strict identifiers of the dialects. Some Kajkavian dialects use &quot;ča&quot; (common in Čakavian), while certain Čakavian dialects, like the Buzet dialect in Istria, use &quot;kaj&quot;. The names of these dialects are based on the most common pronoun used, not an absolute rule.

Autonyms used throughout history by various Kajkavian writers have been manifold, ranging from &quot;Slavic&quot; (&quot;slavonski&quot;, &quot;slovenski&quot;, &quot;slovinski&quot;) to &quot;Croatian&quot; (&quot;horvatski&quot;) or &quot;Illyrian&quot; (&quot;illirski&quot;). The naming went through several phases, with the Slavic-based name initially being dominant. Over time, the name &quot;Croatian&quot; started gaining ground mainly during the 17th century, and by the beginning of the 18th century, it had supplanted the older name &quot;Slavic&quot;. The name also followed the same evolution in neighboring Slovene Prekmurje and some other border areas in what is now Slovenia, although there the name &quot;Slovene-Croatian&quot; (&quot;slovensko-horvatski&quot;) existed as well. The actual term Kajkavian (&quot;kajkavski&quot;), including as an adjective, was invented in the 19th century and is credited to Serbian philologist Đuro Daničić, while it was generally used and promoted in the 20th century works by Croatian writer Miroslav Krleža. The term is today accepted by its speakers in Croatia.

== Classification ==
Historically, the classification of Kajkavian has been a subject of much debate regarding both the question of whether it ought to be considered a dialect or a language, as well as the question of what its relation is to neighboring vernaculars.

The problem with classifying Kajkavian within South Slavic stems in part from its both structural differences and closesness with neighboring Čakavian and Štokavian speeches as well as its historical closeness to Slovene speeches. Some Slavists maintain that when the separation of Western South Slavic speeches happened, they separated into five divergent groups — Slovene, Kajkavian, Čakavian, Western Štokavian and Eastern Štokavian, as a result of this, throughout history Kajkavian has often been categorized differently, either a node categorized together with Serbo-Croatian or Slovene. Furthermore, there do exist few old isoglosses that separate almost all Slovene speeches from all other Western South Slavic dialects, and do exist innovations exist common to Kajkavian, Čakavian, and Western Štokavian that would separate them from Slovene. Croatian linguist Stjepan Ivšić has used Kajkavian vocabulary and accentuation, which significantly differs from that of Štokavian, as evidence to be a language in its own right. Josip Silić, one of the main initiators behind the standardisation of Croatian, also regards Kajkavian as a distinct language by dint of its having significantly different morphology, syntax and phonology from the official Štokavian-based standard. However, Silić&#x27;s theorization about three languages and systems of Croatian, based on Ferdinand de Saussure and Eugenio Coșeriu concepts, is criticized for being exaggerated, incomprehensible and logically non-existent. According to Ranko Matasović, Kajkavian is equally Croatian as Čakavian and Štokavian dialects. Mate Kapović notes that the dialects are practical and provisory linguistic inventions which should not be misunderstood and extrapolated outside the context of the dialect continuum.

According to Mijo Lončarić (1988), the formation of the Proto-Kajkavian linguistic and territorial unit would be around the 10th century (when it separated from Southwestern Slavic), until the 12th century it is a separate node of Croatian-Serbian language family (excluding Slovene), between the 13th and 15th century when formed as a dialect with main features known today, until the end of the 17th century when lost a part of spoken territory (to the South, Southeast and especially to East in Slavonia), and from the 17th-18th century till present time when regained part of lost territory by forming new transitional dialects.

== Characteristics ==
The Kajkavian speech area borders in the northwest on the Slovene language and in the northeast on the Hungarian language. In the east and southeast it is bordered by Štokavian dialects roughly along a line that used to serve as the border between Civil Croatia and the Habsburg Military Frontier. Finally, in the southwest, it borders Čakavian along the Kupa and Dobra rivers. It is thought by M. Lončarić that historically these borders extended further to the south and east, for example, the eastern border is thought to have extended at least well into modern-day Slavonia to the area around the town of Pakrac and Slatina, while East of it transitional Kajkavian-Štokavian dialects. The transitional dialects during Ottoman invasion and migrations almost completely vanished.

The Croatian capital, Zagreb, has historically been a Kajkavian-speaking area, and Kajkavian is still in use by its older and (to a lesser extent) by its younger population. Modern Zagreb speech has come under considerable influence from Štokavian. The vast intermingling of Kajkavian and standard Štokavian in Zagreb and its surroundings has led to problems in defining the underlying structure of those speech-groups. As a result, many of the urban speeches (but not rural ones) have been labelled either &quot;Kajkavian koine&quot; or &quot;Kajkavian–Štokavian&quot; rather than Kajkavian or Štokavian. Additionally, the forms of speech in use exhibit significant sociolinguistic variation. Research suggests that younger Zagreb-born speakers of the Kajkavian koine tend to consciously use more Kajkavian features when speaking to older people, showing that such features are still in their linguistic inventory even if not used at all times. However, the Kajkavian koine is distinct from Kajkavian as spoken in non-urban areas, and the mixing of Štokavian and Kajkavian outside of urban settings is much rarer and less developed. The Kajkavian koine has also been named &quot;Zagreb Štokavian&quot; by some.

As a result of the previously mentioned mixing of dialects, various Kajkavian features and characteristics have found their way into the standard Štokavian (&quot;standard Croatian&quot;) spoken in those areas. For example, some of the prominent features are the fixed stress-based accentual system without distinctive lengths, the merger of /č/ and /ć/ and of /dž/ and /đ/, vocabulary differences as well as a different place of stress in words. The Zagreb variety of Štokavian is considered by some to enjoy parallel prestige with the prescribed Štokavian variety. Because of that, speakers whose native speech is closer to the standard variety often end up adopting the Zagreb speech for various reasons.

Kajkavian is closely related to Slovene – and to Prekmurje Slovene in particular. Higher amounts of correspondences between the two exist in inflection and vocabulary. The speakers of the Prekmurje dialect are Slovenes and Hungarian Slovenes who belonged to the Archdiocese of Zagreb during the Habsburg era (until 1918). They used Kajkavian as their liturgical language, and by the 18th century, Kajkavian had become the standard language of Prekmurje. Moreover, literary Kajkavian was also used in neighboring Slovene Styria during the 17th and 18th centuries, and in parts of it, education was conducted in Kajkavian.

As a result of various factors, Kajkavian has numerous differences compared to Štokavian:

* Kajkavian has a prothetic &quot;v-&quot; generalized in front of &quot;u&quot; (compare Kajkavian &quot;vuho&quot;, Štokavian &quot;uho&quot;; Kajkavian &quot;vugel&quot;, Štokavian &quot;ugao&quot;; Kajkavian &quot;vučil&quot;, Štokavian &quot;učio&quot;). This feature has been attested in Glagolitic texts very early on, already around the 15th century (Petrisov zbornik, 1468). A similar feature exists in colloquial Czech, as well as in many Slovene dialects, especially from the Pannonian, Styrian and Littoral dialect groups.
* Proto-Slavic *dj resulted in Kajkavian &quot;j&quot; as opposed to Štokavian &quot;đ&quot; (cf. Kajkavian &quot;meja&quot;, Štokavian &quot;međa&quot;, Slovene &quot;meja&quot;).
* The nasal *ǫ has evolved into a closed /o/ in Kajkavian (cf. Kajkavian &quot;roka&quot;, Štokavian &quot;ruka&quot;, Slovene &quot;roka&quot;).
* Common Slavic *v and *v- survived as &quot;v&quot; in Kajkavian, whereas in Štokavian they resulted in &quot;u&quot; and &quot;u-&quot;, and in Čakavian they gave way to &quot;va&quot;. The same feature is maintained in most Slovene dialects.
* Kajkavian has retained /č/ in front of /r/ (cf. Kajkavian &quot;črn&quot;, &quot;črv&quot;, Štokavian &quot;crn&quot;, &quot;crv&quot;, Slovene &quot;črn&quot;, &quot;črv&quot;).
* Kajkavian /ž/ in front of a vowel turns into /r/. A similar evolution happened in Slovene, Čakavian as well as Western Štokavian, however the latter does not use it in its standard form (cf. Kajkavian &quot;moči &gt; morem/moreš/more&quot;, Štokavian &quot;moći &gt; mogu/možeš/može&quot;, Slovene &quot;moči &gt; morem/moreš/more&quot;).
* Kajkavian retains &quot;-jt&quot; and &quot;-jd&quot; clusters (cf. Kajkavian &quot;pojti&quot;, &quot;pojdem&quot;, Štokavian &quot;poći&quot;, &quot;pođem&quot;). This feature is shared by standard Slovene.
* Like most Slavic varieties (including Slovenian, but not Štokavian), Kajkavian exhibits final-obstruent devoicing, however it is not consistently spelled out (cf. Kajkavian &quot;vrak&quot;, Štokavian &quot;vrag&quot;)
* Diminutive suffixes in Kajkavian are &quot;-ek&quot;, &quot;-ec&quot;, &quot;-eko&quot;, &quot;-eco&quot; (cf. Kajkavian &quot;pes &gt; pesek&quot;, Štokavian &quot;pas &gt; psić&quot;). The same diminutive suffixes are found in Slovene.
* Negative past-tense construction in Kajkavian deviates syntactically from neighboring speeches in its placing of the negative particle. Some argued that this might indicate a remnant of the Pannonian Slavic system. Similar behavior occurs in Slovak (compare Kajkavian &quot;ja sem nę čul&quot;, Slovene &quot;jaz nisem čul&quot;, Štokavian &quot;ja nisam čuo&quot;).
* Some variants of Kajkavian have a different first-person plural present-tense suffix, &quot;-mę&quot; (cf. Kajkavian &quot;-mę&quot;, &quot;rečemę&quot;, Slovene &quot;-mo&quot;, &quot;rečemo&quot;, Štokavian &quot;-mo&quot;, &quot;kažemo&quot;, Slovak &quot;-me&quot;, &quot;povieme&quot;) such as the Bednja dialect, although most Kajkavian sub-dialects retain the suffix &quot;-mo.&quot;
* Relative pronouns differ from neighboring dialects and languages (although they are similar to Slovene). Kajkavian uses &quot;kateri&quot;, &quot;tęri&quot; and &quot;šteri&quot; depending on sub-dialect (cf. Czech &quot;který&quot;, Slovak &quot;ktorý&quot;, Štokavian &quot;koji&quot;, standard Slovene &quot;kateri&quot;, Carniolan dialects &quot;k&#x27;teri&quot;, &quot;kęri&quot;).
* The genitive plural in Štokavian adds an -a to the end, whereas Kajkavian retains the old form (cf. Kajkavian &quot;vuk&quot;, &quot;vukov/vukof&quot;, Štokavian &quot;vuk&quot;, &quot;vukova&quot;, Slovene &quot;volk&quot;, &quot;volkov&quot;, Kajkavian &quot;žene&quot;, &quot;žen&quot;, Štokavian &quot;žene&quot;, &quot;žena&quot;, Slovene &quot;žene&quot;, &quot;žen&quot;/&quot;žena&quot;).
* Kajkavian retains the older locative plural (compare Kajkavian &quot;prsti&quot;, &quot;prsteh&quot;, Štokavian &quot;prsti&quot;, &quot;prstima&quot;, Slovene &quot;prsti&quot;, &quot;prstih&quot;).
* The loss of the dual is considered to be significantly more recent than in Štokavian.
* Kajkavian has no vocative case. This feature is shared with standard Slovene and most Slovene dialects.
* So-called &quot;s-type nouns&quot; have been retained as a separate declension class in Kajkavian contrasted from the neuter due to the formant &quot;-es-&quot; in oblique cases. The same is true for Slovene (compare Kajkavian &quot;čudo&quot;, &quot;čudesa&quot;, Štokavian &quot;čudo&quot;, &quot;čuda&quot;, Slovene &quot;čudo&quot;, &quot;čudesa&quot;).
* Kajkavian has no aorist. The same is true for Slovene.
* The supine has been retained as distinctive from infinitive, as in Slovene. The infinitive suffixes are &quot;-ti&quot;, &quot;-či&quot; whereas their supine counterparts are &quot;-t&quot;, &quot;-č&quot;. The supine and the infinitive are often stressed differently. The supine is used with verbs of motion.
* The future tense is formed with the auxiliary &quot;biti&quot; and the &quot;-l&quot; participle as in standard Slovene and similar to Czech and Slovak (compare Kajkavian &quot;išel bom&quot;, Štokavian &quot;ići ću&quot;, standard Slovene &quot;šel bom&quot;, eastern Slovene dialects &quot;išel bom&quot;).
* Modern urban Kajkavian speeches tend to have stress as the only significant prosodic feature as opposed to the Štokavian four-tone system.
* Kajkavian exhibits various syntactic influences from German.
* The Slavic prefix u- has a &quot;vi-&quot; reflex in some dialects, similar to Czech &quot;vý-&quot; (compare Kajkavian &quot;vigled&quot;, Czech &quot;výhled&quot;, Štokavian &quot;izgled&quot;). This feature sets Kajkavian apart from Slovene, which shares the prefix -iz with Štokavian.

In addition to the above list of characteristics that set Kajkavian apart from Štokavian, research suggests possible a closer relation with Kajkavian and the Slovak language, especially with the Central Slovak dialects upon which standard Slovak is based. As modern-day Hungary used to be populated by Slavic-speaking peoples prior to the arrival of Hungarians, there have been hypotheses on possible common innovations of future West and South Slavic speakers of that area. Kajkavian is the most prominent of the South Slavic speeches in sharing the most features that could potentially be common Pannonian innovations.

Some Kajkavian words bear a closer resemblance to other Slavic languages such as Russian than they do to Štokavian or Čakavian. For instance &quot;gda&quot; (also seen as shorter &quot;da&quot;) seems to be at first glance unrelated to &quot;kada&quot;, however when compared to Russian &quot;когда&quot;, Slovene &quot;kdaj&quot;, or Prekmurje Slovene &quot;gda&quot;, &quot;kda&quot;, the relationship becomes apparent. Kajkavian &quot;kak&quot; (&quot;how&quot;) and &quot;tak&quot; (&quot;so&quot;) are exactly like their Russian cognates and Prekmurje Slovene compared to Štokavian, Čakavian, and standard Slovene &quot;kako&quot; and &quot;tako&quot;. (This vowel loss occurred in most other Slavic languages; Štokavian is a notable exception, whereas the same feature in Macedonian is probably not due to Serbo-Croatian influence because the word is preserved in the same form in Bulgarian, to which Macedonian is much more closely related than to Serbo-Croatian).

==Phonology==

A generic Kajkavian consonant system consists of 25 phonemes. The following is an example chart of a speech from southern Moslavina.
== History of research ==
Linguistic investigation began during the 19th century, although the research itself often ended in non-linguistic or outdated conclusions. Since that was the age of national revivals across Europe as well as the South Slavic lands, the research was steered by national narratives. Within that framework, Slovene philologists such as Franz Miklosich and Jernej Kopitar attempted to reinforce the idea of Slovene and Kajkavian unity and asserted that Kajkavian speakers are Slovenes. On the other hand, Josef Dobrovský also claimed linguistic and national unity between the two groups but under the Croatian ethnonym.

The first modern dialectal investigations of Kajkavian started at the end of the 19th century. The Ukrainian philologist A. M. Lukjanenko wrote the first comprehensive monograph on Kajkavian (titled &quot;Кайкавское нарѣчiе&quot; (&quot;Kajkavskoe narečie&quot;) meaning &quot;The Kajkavian dialect&quot;) in Russian in 1905. Kajkavian dialects have been classified along various criteria: for instance Serbian philologist Aleksandar Belić divided (1927) the Kajkavian dialect according to the reflexes of Proto-Slavic phonemes /tj/ and /dj/ into three subdialects: eastern, northwestern and southwestern.

However, later investigations did not corroborate Belić&#x27;s division. Contemporary Kajkavian dialectology begins with Croatian philologist Stjepan Ivšić&#x27;s work &quot;Jezik Hrvata kajkavaca&quot; (&quot;The Language of Kajkavian Croats&quot;, 1936), which highlighted accentual characteristics. Due to the great diversity within Kajkavian primarily in phonetics, phonology, and morphology, the Kajkavian dialect atlas features a large number of subdialects: from four identified by Ivšić to six proposed by Croatian linguist Brozović (formerly the accepted division) all the way up to fifteen according to a monograph by Croatian linguist Mijo Lončarić (1995). The traditional division in six sub-dialects includes: &quot;zagorsko-međimurski&quot;, &quot;križevačko-podravski&quot;, &quot;turopoljsko-posavski&quot;, &quot;prigorski&quot; (transitional to Central Čakavian), &quot;donjosutlanski&quot; (migratory transitional Čakavian-ikavian which became Kajkavian), and &quot;goranski&quot; (also transitional which is more Kajkavian in lesser Eastern part, while more Slovene in main Western part). Kajkavian categorization of transitional dialects, like for example of &quot;prigorski&quot;, is provisory.

== Area of use ==

Kajkavian is mainly spoken in northern and northwestern Croatia. The mixed half-Kajkavian towns along the eastern and southern edge of the Kajkavian-speaking area are Pitomača, Čazma, Kutina, Popovača, Sunja, Petrinja, Martinska Ves, Ozalj, Ogulin, Fužine, and Čabar, including newer Štokavian enclaves of Bjelovar, Sisak, Glina, Donja Dubrava and Novi Zagreb. The southernmost Kajkavian villages are Krapje at Jasenovac; and Pavušek, Dvorišče and Hrvatsko selo in Zrinska Gora (R. Fureš &amp; A. Jembrih: &quot;Kajkavski u povijesnom i sadašnjem obzorju&quot; p. 548, Zabok 2006).

The major cities in northern Croatia are located in what was historically a Kajkavian-speaking area, mainly Zagreb, Koprivnica, Krapina, Križevci, Varaždin, Čakovec. The typical archaic Kajkavian is today spoken mainly in Hrvatsko Zagorje hills and Međimurje plain, and in adjacent areas of northwestern Croatia where immigrants and the Štokavian standard had much less influence. The most peculiar Kajkavian dialect &quot;(Bednjounski)&quot; is spoken in Bednja in northernmost Croatia. Many of northern Croatian urban areas today are partly Štokavianized due to the influence of the standard language and immigration of Štokavian speakers.

Other southeastern people who immigrate to Zagreb from Štokavian territories often pick up rare elements of Kajkavian in order to assimilate, notably the pronoun &quot;kaj&quot; instead of &quot;što&quot; and the extended use of future anterior (&quot;futur drugi&quot;), but they never adapt well because of alien eastern accents and ignoring Kajkavian-Čakavian archaisms and syntax.

== Literary Kajkavian ==

Writings that are judged by some as being distinctly Kajkavian can be dated to around the 12th century. The first comprehensive works in Kajkavian started to appear during the 16th century at a time when Central Croatia gained prominence due to the geopolitical environment since it was free from Ottoman occupation. The most notable work of that era was Ivanuš Pergošić&#x27;s , released in 1574. was a translation of István Werbőczy&#x27;s .

At the same time, many Protestant writers of the Slovene lands also released their works in Kajkavian in order to reach a wider audience, while also using some Kajkavian features in their native writings. During that time, the autonym used by the writers was usually (Slavic), (Croatian) or (Illyrian).

After that, numerous works appeared in the Kajkavian literary language: chronicles by Vramec, liturgical works by Ratkaj, Habdelić, Mulih; poetry by Ana Katarina Zrinska and Fran Krsto Frankopan, and a dramatic opus by Tituš Brezovački. Kajkavian-based are important lexicographic works like Jambrešić&#x27;s &quot;, 1670, and the monumental (2,000 pages and 50,000 words) Latin-Kajkavian-Latin dictionary &quot; (including also some Čakavian and Štokavian words marked as such) by Ivan Belostenec (posthumously, 1740). Miroslav Krleža&#x27;s poetic work &quot;&quot; drew heavily on Belostenec&#x27;s dictionary. Kajkavian grammars include Kornig&#x27;s, 1795, Matijević&#x27;s, 1810 and Đurkovečki&#x27;s, 1837.

During that time, the Kajkavian literary language was the dominant written form in its spoken area along with Latin and German. Until Ljudevit Gaj&#x27;s attempts to modernize the spelling, Kajkavian was written using Hungarian spelling conventions. Kajkavian began to lose its status during the Croatian National Revival in mid-19th Century when the leaders of the Illyrian movement opted to use the Štokavian dialect as the basis for the future South Slavic standard language, the reason being that it had the highest number of speakers. Initially, the choice of Štokavian was accepted even among Slovene intellectuals, but later it fell out of favor. The Zagreb linguistic school was opposed to the course that the standardization process took. Namely, it had almost completely ignored Kajkavian (and Čakavian) dialects which was contrary to the original vision of Zagreb school. With the notable exception of vocabulary influence of Kajkavian on the standard Croatian register (but not the Serbian one), there was very little to no input from other non-Štokavian dialects. Instead, the opposite was done, with some modern-day linguists calling the process of 19th-century standardization an event of &quot;neo-Štokavian purism&quot; and a &quot;purge of non-Štokavian elements&quot;.

Early 20th century witnessed a drastic increase in released Kajkavian literature, although by then it had become part of what was considered Croatian dialectal poetry with no pretense of serving as a standard written form. The most notable writers of this period were among others, Antun Gustav Matoš, Miroslav Krleža, Ivan Goran Kovačić, Dragutin Domjanić and Nikola Pavić.

Kajkavian lexical treasure is being published by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in (&quot;Dictionary of the Croatian Kajkavian Literary Language&quot;, 8 volumes, 1999).

Later, Dario Vid Balog, actor, linguist and writer translated the New Testament in Kajkavian.

In 2018 is published the Kajkavian translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot; () by Kajkavsko spravišče aka .

Below are examples of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the Croatian variant of Štokavian, literary Kajkavian and a Međimurje variant of the Kajkavian dialect.

== Vocabulary comparison ==
What follows is a comparison of some words in Kajkavian, Štokavian and Slovene along with their English translations. Kajkavian is lexically closer to Slovene than to the Croatian Štokavian dialects, which is considered by some another argument that Kajkavian is a separate language. The Kajkavian words are given in their most common orthographic form. Štokavian words are given in their standard Croatian form. In cases where the place of accent or stress differs, the syllable with the stress or accent is indicated in bold. Words that are the same in all three are not listed. Loanwords are also not listed.
== Kajkavian media ==

During Yugoslavia in the 20th century, Kajkavian was mostly restricted to private communication, poetry and folklore. With the recent regional democratizing and cultural revival beginning in the 1990s, Kajkavian partly regained its former half-public position chiefly in Zagorje and Varaždin Counties and local towns, where there is now some public media e.g.:
* A quarterly periodical &quot;Kaj&quot;, with 35 annual volumes in nearly a hundred fascicles published since 1967 by the Kajkavian Association (&#x27;Kajkavsko Spravišče&#x27;) in Zagreb.
* An autumnal week of &quot;Kajkavian culture&quot; in Krapina since 1997, with professional symposia on Kajkavian resulting in five published proceedings.
* An annual periodical, &quot;Hrvatski sjever&quot; (&#x27;Croatian North&#x27;), with a dozen volumes partly in Kajkavian published by Matica Hrvatska in Čakovec.
* A permanent radio program in Kajkavian, &quot;Kajkavian Radio&quot; in Krapina. Other minor half-Kajkavian media with temporary Kajkavian contents include local television in Varaždin, the local radio program &quot;Sljeme&quot; in Zagreb, and some local newspapers in northwestern Croatia in Varaždin, Čakovec, Samobor, etc.

<text>Paul Antonin Vidal (16 June 1863 – 9 April 1931) was a French composer, conductor and music teacher mainly active in Paris.

==Life and career==
Paul Vidal was born in Toulouse, and studied at the conservatoires there and in Paris, under Jules Massenet at the latter. He won the Prix de Rome in 1883, one year before Claude Debussy. On 8 January 1886, in Rome, Vidal and Debussy performed Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; at two pianos for Liszt himself, an after-dinner performance that Liszt apparently slept through. The following day they played Emmanuel Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;Trois valses romantiques&quot; for Liszt.

Vidal conducted at the Opéra National de Paris where he made his first appearance directing &quot;Gwendoline&quot; in 1894 (he had coached the singers for the Paris premiere in 1893), and later conducted the first performance of &quot;Ariane&quot; and the Paris premieres of &quot;Roma&quot; by Massenet, and &quot;L&#x27;étranger&quot; by d’Indy. He co-founded the Concerts de l’Opera with Georges Marty.
He was Music Director of the Opéra-Comique from 1914 to 1919, conducting revivals of &quot;Alceste&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&quot; (the French version of Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni), &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;irato&quot;, &quot;Le Rêve&quot; and &quot;Thérèse&quot;. He also conducted the premieres of several operas and ballets.
He taught at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his students included composers Lili Boulanger, Marc Delmas, Jacques Ibert and Vladimir Fédorov. He died in Paris, aged 67.

His brother Joseph Bernard Vidal (1859-1924) was also a composer.

==Compositions and pedagogy==

His compositions are virtually forgotten today: they include the operas &quot;Eros&quot; (1892), &quot;Guernica&quot; (1895) and &quot;La Burgonde&quot; (1898); ballets &quot;La Maladetta&quot; (1893) and &quot;Fête russe&quot; (1893, arr. - both choreographed by Joseph Hansen, Paris Opera); a cantata &quot;Ecce Sacerdos magnus&quot;; and incidental music to Théodore de Banville&#x27;s &quot;Le Baiser&quot; (1888) and Catulle Mendès&#x27; &quot;La Reine Fiammette&quot; (1898). In collaboration with André Messager, he also orchestrated piano music of Frédéric Chopin into a &quot;Suite de danses&quot; (1913).

He is perhaps better known today through his keyboard harmony exercises, &quot;Recueil de basses et chants donnés&quot; which was a favorite teaching tool of his pupil, the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, and subsequently many of her students including Narcis Bonet who has republished a selection of these exercises under the title &quot;Paul Vidal, Nadia Boulanger: A Collection of Given Basses and Melodies&quot;.

<doc id="993320" wikidata="Q337659" url="?curid=993320" title="Alastair Pilkington">
<text>Sir Lionel Alexander Bethune Pilkington (7 January 1920 – 5 May 1995), known as Sir Alastair Pilkington, was a British engineer and businessman who invented and perfected the float glass process for commercial manufacturing of plate glass.
==Early life==
Born on 7 January 1920 in Calcutta, India, he was the son of Colonel Lionel George Pilkington MC and his wife Evelyn Carnegie Bethune, sister of Sir Alexander Maitland Sharp Bethune, 10th Baronet. He was educated at Sherborne School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Joining the Royal Artillery, he was captured in the Battle of Crete and spent four years as a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany. Returning to university, he obtained a degree in mechanical science, followed in 1947 by a job as technical officer with the glass manufacturers Pilkington Brothers. He was not related to the Pilkington family which then controlled the business.

==Business career==

In 1952 Pilkington invented the float glass process, in which molten glass was &quot;floated&quot; over a bath of molten tin and manipulated to achieve the required product thickness, and with his associate Kenneth Bickerstaff, spent seven years perfecting and patenting its commercially successful manufacture. American inventors had tried several times to achieve an improved and lower-cost process to replace the costly plate glass, but had not succeeded. His breakthrough was announced to the glassmaking world on 20 January 1959 and enabled Pilkingtons to dominate the world market for high quality flat glass for many years. Starting in the early 1960s, all the world&#x27;s leading flat glass manufacturers obtained licences to use the float glass process. 
From technical director of Pilkingtons in 1955, he became deputy chairman in 1971 and chairman from 1973 until he reached retirement age in 1980, leaving the board in 1985.
For the rest of his life he was the company&#x27;s president.

==Outside activities and honours==
In 1969 Pilkington was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1970 a Knight Bachelor, as well as receiving the Wilhelm Exner Medal. In 1978 he was awarded the A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize and in 1983–1984 served as president of the British Science Association.

Outside directorships included appointments as a director of the Bank of England from 1974 to 1984 and a director of BP from 1976 to his death. A passionate advocate of tertiary education, he was from 1980 to 1990 Pro-Chancellor of Lancaster University, from 1990 Chairman of the Campaign for the University and Colleges of Cambridge and from 1994 to his death Chancellor of the University of Liverpool. He was chairman of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) from 1983 to 1987.

The Pilkington Awards were established at Lancaster University in 1985 through funds donated by Sir Alastair Pilkington. These consist of cash grants for three undergraduates registered at Lancaster University for a single major or combined degree in chemistry, computing, engineering or physics. Since the mid-1990s, the University of Liverpool has used the annual Sir Alastair Pilkington Awards to honour staff members for their contributions to student learning.
A building at the University of Liverpool is named in his honour. In May 2022 the Georgian portion of this building was renamed Gillian Howie House, while the Victorian part of the building has housed the University of Liverpool Mathematics School, an Ofsted &quot;Outstanding&quot; 16-19 Specialist Mathematics School, since September 2020. A reading room in Lancaster University&#x27;s library is named in his honour.

==Family==
In 1945 in London he married Patricia Nicholls Elliott, a former Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service officer who was the daughter of Rear-Admiral Frank Elliott OBE, and they had a daughter together with an adopted son. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1977, in 1978 he married the American former radio actress Leila Kathleen Wilson, widow of Eldridge Haynes.

<text>In game theory, a contingent cooperator is a person or agent who is willing to act in the collective interest, rather than his short-term selfish interest, if he observes a majority of the other agents in the collective doing the same. The apparent contradiction in this stance is resolved by game theory, which shows that in the right circumstances, cooperation with a sufficient number of other participants will have a better outcome for cooperators than pursuing short-term selfish interests.

<text>A tenant management organisations (TMO) is an organisation set up under the UK Government&#x27;s Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994, which allow residents of council housing or housing association homes in the UK to take over responsibility for the running of their homes.

==Structure and operation==
A TMO is created when residents (tenants and leaseholders) in a defined area of council or housing association homes create a corporate body and, typically, elect a management committee to run the body. This body then enters into a formal legal contract between the landlord of the home(s) and the council, known as the management agreement. This agreement outlines the services a TMO is responsible for and what services the council is responsible for. The services provided by TMOs are mainly funded by the management fees paid by the Council under the agreement.

The management agreement details precisely which services are managed by the TMO on behalf of the landlord. The extent of the devolution in service can vary enormously, particularly between small and large TMOs, but may typically include day-to-day repairs, allocations and lettings, tenancy management, cleaning and care taking and rent collection/recovery.

The TMO can take a number of legal forms. Registered TMOs may be a co-operative, or set up under corporate law.

Some &#x27;guide TMOs&#x27; provide support to community groups interested in the concept (Friday Hill TMO and Millbank Estate TMO are two examples in London). The work of a TMO may touch and overlap with that of an arms-length management organisation (ALMO).

== Setting up a TMO ==
The London Borough of Hackney council website states the following as a possible plan to set up a TMO:

# Explore the options for involvement
# Right to manage notice
# Develop business plan training and negotiations
# Competence assessment
# Offer to tenants and then ballot
# Setting up and going live

If a TMO is set up, you will still remain as a tenant or a leaseholder of the council and your existing rights are protected.

<doc id="993331" wikidata="Q337565" url="?curid=993331" title="Chakavian">
<text>Chakavian or Čakavian (, , , proper name: or own name: &quot;čokovski, čakavski, čekavski&quot;) is a South Slavic supradialect or language spoken by Croats along the Adriatic coast, in the historical regions of Dalmatia, Istria, Croatian Littoral and parts of coastal and southern Central Croatia (now collectively referred to as Adriatic Croatia or Littoral Croatia), as well as by the Burgenland Croats as Burgenland Croatian in southeastern Austria, northwestern Hungary and southwestern Slovakia as well as few municipalities in southern Slovenia on the border with Croatia.

Chakavian represents the basis for early literary standards in Croatia, and until the modern age was simply known and understood, along with the Kajkavian and Shtokavian idioms in Croatia, as the Croatian language (&quot;hrvatski jezik&quot;). Legal and liturgical to literary texts until the 16th century, including literary work by &quot;the father of Croatian literature&quot; Marko Marulić and the first Croatian dictionary authored by Faust Vrančić, among others, are mostly Chakavian in their form. The term Chakavian and definition of the dialect date from the mid-19th century.

==Classification==
Historically, the classification of Chakavian has been a subject of much debate regarding both the question of how should it be named and whether it ought to be considered a dialect or a language, as well as the question of what its relation is to neighboring vernaculars (Kajkavian, Western Shtokavian and Eastern Shtokavian).

Autonyms used throughout history by various Chakavian writers have been straightforward, ranging from mainly Croatian (&quot;harvatski&quot;, &quot;harvacki&quot;, &quot;hrvatski&quot;) to Slavic (&quot;slovinski&quot;) and Illyrian (&quot;illirski&quot;), but also other idioms, Kajkavian and Shtokavian, throughout history were named and understood as Croatian language. Chakavian compared to others is one of the oldest written South Slavic varieties that had made a visible appearance in legal documents—as early as 1275 (Istrian land survey) and 1288 (Vinodol codex), where the predominantly vernacular Chakavian is recorded, mixed with elements of Church Slavic. However, in both of them it is named as &quot;Croatian language&quot; (&quot;jazikom harvaskim/hrvatski/hervatski&quot;). The term Chakavian (noun &quot;čakavac&quot;) is first recorded in 1728 in the Ardelio Della Bella&#x27;s &quot;Dizionario italiano-latino-illirico&quot; and in the beginning of the 19th century in Joakim Stulić&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon latino–italico–illyricum&quot;, while adjective (&quot;čakavski&quot;) in Antun Mažuranić&#x27;s analysis of Vinodol codex (1843). No Croatian literary writer used words &quot;čakavac&quot; and &quot;čakavski&quot; to describe their, Croatian, language until the late 19th century, and it is mostly since the 20th century that these terms have been popularized through the education system. Croatian literary authors of what would later be known as Chakavian and Shtokavian idioms, from different parts of Dalmatia and Ragusa, in corresponding letters wrote that they belonged to the same Croatian nation, and spoke the same language (&quot;časti našega jezika&quot;, &quot;naš jezik&quot;) which they named as Croatian or Slavic (&quot;kud jezik harvatski prohodi&quot;, &quot;slovinski jezik&quot;). With its name and dialectological or language form, it is mainly a creation advanced by linguists. Today, the term Chakavian is accepted by its speakers and linguists in Croatia, but usually for practical reasons. 

In its almost thousand years, Chakavian has undergone many phonetic, morphological, and syntactical changes -- chiefly in the turbulent mainlands, but less in isolated islands. The problem with classifying Chakavian within Western South Slavic stems in part from there being no unanimous opinion on the set of traits a dialect has to possess to be classified as Chakavian (usually argued only as a gradation of &quot;Chakavism&quot;). Its sub-dialects have various differences but also closeness to neighboring Shtokavian and Kajkavian speeches, and all three dialects are part of a dialect continuum, while their diversification into dialects and languages is mostly political, ethnic and symbolic. From a linguistic point of view, national and other names based on interrogatory pronouns are practical, but also inaccurate as dialect/language definitions; linguists would more precisely replace these with complex isoglosses in the dialect continuum.

Dialectologists and Slavists maintain that when the separation of Western South Slavic speeches happened, they separated into five divergent groups, more specifically two, one Slovene and second Serbo-Croatian with four divergent groups - Kajkavian, Chakavian, Western Shtokavian and Eastern Shtokavian. The latter group can be additionally divided into first (Kajkavian, Chakavian, Western Shtokavian) and second (Eastern Shtokavian, Torlakian). According to isoglosses, and presumed end of existence of the Southwestern Slavic around the 8th-9th century, the formation of the assumed Proto-Chakavian linguistic and territorial unit would be around the 9th-10th century (when it and Proto-Western Shtokavian separated), while of the Chakavian dialect known today between the 12th-16th century.
Very few, trivial, isoglosses exist that separate all Chakavian speeches from all other Western South Slavic dialects nor do exist common isoglosses to all Chakavian sub-dialects from which would be possible a deduction of a &quot;Proto-Chakavian&quot; dialect or language (which is possible with Proto-Kajkavian and Proto-Shtokavian). Ranko Matasović concludes as well that &quot;the Chakavian dialect was never entirely unique, i.e. it is not possible to find common linguistic innovations that would encompass all Chakavian speeches&quot;, &quot;while common-Shokavian and common-Kaikavian innovations do exist&quot;. There exist significant differences between Northern and all other Chakavian sub-dialects, as Northern Chakavian has characteristics common with Slovene and Kajkavian while Southern Chakavian with Western Shtokavian, but also Northern Chakavian has with Shtokavian, and both Northern and Southern Chakavian have with the Kajkavian dialect. Many linguists, including Aleksandar Belić, Stjepan Ivšić, Zvonimir Junković, Pavle Ivić, Dalibor Brozović among others, in their comparative analysis concluded that Chakavian is closely related to Western Shtokavian (particularly those of Schakavian ikavian expression like the Slavonian dialect and Younger Ikavian dialect). Ivić for example concluded that the Chakavian dialect is genetically much closer to Shtokavian than Kajkavian, and initially argued that &quot;Historically speaking, Chakavian is to a considerable extent a peripheral zone of Shtokavian which (in) many respects lagged behind the development of the [Shtokavian] core, and which parts developed locally limited innovations (with the fact that its Northwestern branches had from the very beginning specific evolutionary contacts with the Slovenian language)&quot;. Brozović argued four accentological cores from which dialects emerged, one in which were grouped few Chakavian speeches, while the majority of Chakavian speeches were grouped with Western Shtokavian dialect (Southeastern Chakavian) and part of Southern-Slavonian dialect (Northwestern and Central Chakavian). Today, Chakavian is mostly considered as a separate and unique linguistic system which can be further divided.

According to Mate Kapović, some Croatian linguists have a &quot;Chakavian nationalist&quot; desire to prove various speeches as Chakavian which, according to him, is scientifically unsustainable. Josip Silić, for example, argued that Chakavian is not a dialect of Croatian language but a one of three Croatian linguistic systems, a language on its own but without standard, which was met with criticism. At the suggestion of American linguist Kirk Miller in 2019, the Chakavian dialect was recognized by SIL International as a living language with its own ISO 639-3 code – &quot;ckm&quot; in 2020. The recognition was mostly met with silence and ignorance in Croatia and by Croatian linguists and scientists (until early 2023 news media reports), partly because it does not affect dialect status of Chakavian nor does it have relevancy in international and national linguistic science. Academic and currently leading expert on Chakavian, Silvana Vranić, noted that Chakavian idiom is a dialect group of sub-dialects of Croatian language of Western South-Slavic from which cannot be removed and considered a separate language. She criticized Miller&#x27;s documentation as it was based on two irrelevant and unscientific sources with &quot;scientific falsehood&quot; (including false claim of low dialectological difference between different Chakavian speeches). Joško Božanić noted the paradox of SIL International, as the institute already registered in 2008 the Croatian language as a South Slavic language with three dialects (Kajkavian, Chakavian, Shtokavian). He considers that the re-valorization of Chakavian idiom should not come from a foreign country, and Croatian initiatives possibly need to aim listing it on UNESCO&#x27;s Red Book list on endangered languages in Europe. Josip Bratulić and Mira Menac-Mihalić consider that such recognition won&#x27;t achieve anything, including its preservation, as Chakavian won&#x27;t be spoken or studied more than it was until now. openly criticized it as an example of ignorance and misunderstanding of the Croatian language as well as history, definition and characteristics of the so-called Chakavian dialect. Vidović relates it to the modern Croatian phenomenon of &quot;linguistic separatism&quot; which argues for finding a solution for preserving various Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian idioms from influence of Croatian standard language, although in Croatia various efforts are already made for their preservation and popularization, and the comparatively much longer influence of the Italian language on Chakavian is ignored. Croatian political scientist Viktor Matić considers that the Croatian &quot;linguistic separatism&quot; has antagonism against Croatian standard language but it is also result of previous fetishising of Croatian standard language and Serbo-Croatian language.

===Research===
====Early modern age====
The earliest theorization about Chakavian originates in the 19th century nation-building and romantic nationalism. At the time the widespread belief was that individual ethnic nation must be historically characterized and identified with a specific language (which was argued pseudo-scientifically according interrogatory pronouns, yat reflex, and various historiographical theories usually related to &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; from the 10th century). In the beginning of the debate, as Chakavian did not exist yet, Kajkavian was identified with the Croats and Shtokavian with the Serbs (with Shtokavian-speaking Croats considered as &quot;Catholic Serbs&quot;). As soon as theorization about Chakavian began, early Slavists such as Josef Dobrovský, Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Jernej Kopitar, Vuk Karadžić grouped Chakavian with Shtokavian, but as Shtokavian was perceived as an exclusively Serbian language, the Croats were reduced to merely a toponym (or Chakavian and Shtokavian-speaking &quot;Catholic Serbs&quot;). At the time were also coined terms such as &quot;Slavic-Serbian&quot; and &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; language. With new insights by the mid-19th century, Chakavian was considered to be the only and original language of Croats, while Kajkavian was related to the Slovenes, and Shtokavian continued to be related with the Serbs (per Vuk Karadžić etc.). Others however, like August Leskien, continued to advance the older opinion until the late 19th century. The basic premise was that with the Ottoman invasion most of Croatia lost its native ethnic Croatian population because the presumed borders of the Chakavian speakers were reduced, and they therefore became ethnically Serbian. Some believed that Kajkavian-speaking Croats took over Serbian (Shtokavian-Chakavian) literary language. Such, more political than scientific misconceptions were present both on the Serbian and Croatian sides and internationally, and continue to plague the public and less scientific viewpoint and understanding of the Serbo-Croatian dialects, being among pivotal points of legitimacy for the 20th century nationalist revisionism and pretensions (including the recent 1990s Yugoslav Wars). The terms of Chakavian and Shtokavian dialect were introduced to Croatian linguistics by Antun Mažuranić and Vjekoslav Babukić in the mid-19th century.

====Recent studies====
Due to its archaic nature, early medieval development, and corpus of vernacular literacy, the typical Chakavian dialect has attracted numerous dialectologists who have documented its nuances, so that Chakavian was among the best described Slavic dialects, but its atypical tsakavism was partly neglected and less studied. Contemporary dialectologists are particularly interested in it since it has retained the old accentuation system characterized by a Proto-Slavic new rising accent (&quot;neoacute&quot;) and the old position of stress, and also numerous Proto-Slavic and some Proto-Indo-European archaisms in its vocabulary.

Another feature of Chakavian is the strong influence of Romance languages in its lexicon and phonology (especially from Italian, Dalmatian and Venetian). Furthermore, Italian linguist Matteo Bartoli wrote in 1919 that more than one third of the Chakavian spoken in Istria was loanworded from Neo-Latin (Romance) languages, a percentage similar to the one in the Gheg dialect of northern coastal Albania. It is also well known for many maritime words and terms missing in the Croatian standard language.

Many lexicons of local Chakavian varieties have been published. The representative modern work in the field is &quot;Čakavisch-deutsches Lexikon&quot;, vol. 1.-3, Koeln-Vienna, 1979–1983, edited by Croatian linguists Mate Hraste, Petar Šimunović and German linguist Reinhold Olesch; Janne Kalsbeek&#x27;s work on &quot;The Čakavian Dialect of Orbanići near Žminj in Istria&quot; (1998); Keith Langston&#x27;s &quot;Cakavian Prosody: The Accentual Patterns of the Cakavian Dialects of Croatian&quot; (2006); Josip Lisac&#x27;s &quot;Hrvatska Dijalektologija 2. Čakavsko narječje&quot; (2009), various works by Iva Lukežić, Sanja Zubčić, Silvana Vranić, Sanja Vulić, Mate Kapović and so on.

==Chakavian literary language==
Since Chakavian was the first South Slavic dialect to emerge from the Church Slavic matrix, both literacy and literature in this dialect abound with numerous texts - from legal and liturgical to literary: lyric and epic poetry, drama, novel in verses, as well as philological works that contain Chakavian vocabulary. Chakavian idiom was &quot;de facto&quot; the main public and official language in medieval Croatia up to the 16th century. Chakavian literature uses many words of Latin, Dalmatian, and Italian origin due to the millennial long contacts with these languages. When compared different epochs with different status of Chakavian dialect (i.e. Croatian language), such words became more widespread in local speeches in the last few centuries, creating various Chakavian-Italian hybrid words. There also exist significant differences in the lexicon between Northwestern and Southeastern groups of sub-dialects, showing there is no unique Chakavian language system.

Comparison of earliest texts in Croatia shows that the Slavic language changed until the 11th century and was not exclusively of Chakavian idiom, and Chakavian features started to be widespread only since 12th-13th century when can be dated formation of Chakavian dialect. Monuments of literacy began to appear in the 11th and 12th centuries, and artistic literature in the 15th. There were two zones of Chakavian, northern and southern (both mainly along the Adriatic coast and islands, with centres like Senj, Zadar, Split, Hvar, Korčula). Many of these used Chakavian, and up to the 17th century the texts were written in Glagolitic, Bosnian Cyrillic, and the Latin alphabet.

The Chakavian language by far surpassed the position of a simple vernacular dialect and strongly influenced other Croatian literary dialects, particularly Western Shtokavian: the first Shtokavian texts such as the Vatican Croatian Prayer Book, dated to 1400, exhibit numerous literary Chakavianisms. The early Shtokavian literary and philological output, mainly from Dubrovnik (1500–1600) up to Džore Držić, was essentially a mixed Shtokavian–Chakavian idiom.

The most famous early Chakavian author is Marko Marulić in 15th-16th century, the &quot;father of Croatian literature&quot;, and were written first Croatian novels and poems. Also, the first Croatian dictionary, authored by Faust Vrančić, is mostly Chakavian in its form. Although in the 18th century was with Kajkavian and Shtokavian one of the basis of Croatian literary centre in Ozalj (led by Croatian noble families Frankopan and Zrinski), the tradition of the Chakavian literary language had declined in the same century, but it has helped shape both Croatian literary language and the standard Croatian language in many ways, chiefly in morphology and phonetics, and Chakavian dialectal poetry is still a vital part of Croatian literature.

In the Croatian and world literature, it remerged in the 20th century thanks to early writing of Tin Ujević, Marko Uvodić, Miljenko Smoje, and the most prominent representatives in the 20th century are Mate Balota, Vladimir Nazor and Drago Gervais. In 1938, Balota&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Dragi kamen&quot; was published in Zagreb, while his only novel, &quot;Tight Country: A Novel from Istrian Folk Life&quot;, was published in 1946. The novel became a cult among Kvarner and Istrian Croats. At the end of the 1980s in Istria and Kvarner there began a special subgenre of pop-rock music movement &quot;(Cha wave)&quot;; artists that were part of this scene used the Chakavian dialect in their lyrics, and often fused rock music with traditional Istra-Kvarner music (most notably Alen Vitasović, Gustafi, ).

==Area of use==
In the Middle Ages, on the territory of medieval Croatia formed three dialects; Chakavian, Western Shtokavian and Kajkavian. Initially, the Chakavian dialect covered a much wider area than today: the major part of western-central and southern Croatia southwards of Kupa and westwards of Una river, bordering with the western and southwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina, including all the Eastern Adriatic islands northwest of Mljet, while substratum of Chakavian in Dalmatia possibly existed all the way to Dubrovnik. Croatian dialectologist Petar Šimunović considered that all area until and with Dubrovnik was originally Chakavian. The Dubrovnik area has phonology closer to Southern Chakavian than Eastern Shtokavian. It is possible that some Chakavian idioms were also present in early medieval Montenegro and Albania. However, linguists also point to the fact that it is not possible to draw historical border between Chakavian and Shtokavian, especially Western Shtokavian, with certainty. According to Serbian linguist Pavle Ivić, &quot;the question of where the border of these two dialects was in the Middle Ages is not quite appropriate&quot;.

During and after the Ottoman invasion and subsequent warfare (15th–19th centuries) on the territory of Croatia, the Chakavian dialect area (&quot;jazik hrvatski&quot;) became significantly reduced, and on the Croatian mainland, it has been almost completely replaced by the adjacent Shtokavian dialect. In the process the evident dialect continuum was broken as old transitional dialects were lost. Based on 35 letters by Ottoman officers in their native language between the mid-16th and mid-17th century in Dalmatia, almost all of them were Chakavian-Schakavian ikavian. Today, only Northern Chakavian and partly Buzet dialect are widely spoken in the areas where they are located, as all other Chakavian dialects have greatly lost territory, or were assimilated into Shtokavian.

According to Josip Lisac, Chakavian dialect would have been the best dialectological basis for the Croatian standard language (Chakavian and Kajkavian nevertheless still had an important active role in the standardization of the Croatian language). The reason it was not chosen for the basis of Croatian standard language in the 19th century is considered to be the significant reduction of dialect area due to previous migrations and change of dialectical contacts, but others disagree and point that such argument initially only hindered scientific research. It certainly was the main, but not only reason, as the &quot;results of convergent Croatian literary and linguistic development&quot; can be traced to literary and sacral works at least since first half of the 16th century. Over time, it was perceived as an archaic, less prestigious dialect.

The use of Chakavian varies by the region where it was historically spoken. It is now mostly reduced to Croatia along the eastern Adriatic: Adriatic islands, and sporadically in the mainland coast, with rare inland enclaves up to central Croatia, and minor enclaves in Austria and Montenegro. All of those areas were in contact with Italo-Dalmatian and Eastern Romance languages, which heavily influenced the development of Chakavian. It is estimated that the share of Croatian language speakers who spoke a Chakavian dialect fell from 23% to 12% over the course of the 20th century.

Areas where Chakavian is spoken include:
* The majority of Adriatic islands, except for the easternmost islands (Mljet and Elafiti), the easternmost areas of Hvar and Brač, and the area around the city of Korčula.
* The entire Istria peninsula, and Kvarner littoral and islands; minor coastal enclaves occur sporadically in the Dalmatian mainland around Zadar, Biograd, Split, and on the Pelješac peninsula. It has almost vanished in Šibenik and Omiš.
* Within the Croatian inland, it is the Gacka valley, and minor enclaves occur in Pokupje valley and Žumberak hills, northwards around Karlovac.
* A minor enclave of Bigova (Trašte) at Boka Kotorska in Montenegro, the mixed Čičarija dialect in Slovenia, refugees from the Ottoman Empire in Burgenland (eastern Austria) and around Bratislava, and a substratum in Slavomolisano 
* Among recent emigrants in North America (chiefly in New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Vancouver).

==Sub-dialects==
There is no unanimous opinion on the set of traits a dialect has to possess to be classified as Chakavian (rather than its admixture with Shtokavian or Kajkavian). Josip Lisac mentions up to 21, but many of them are not common to all Chakavian sub-dialects and often can be found in non-Chakavian dialects. The following traits were mostly proposed:
* interrogatory pronoun is &quot;ča&quot; or &quot;zač&quot; (on some islands also &quot;ca&quot; or &quot;zace&quot;);
* old accentuation and 3 accents (mostly in ultima or penultima);
* phonological features that yield /a/ for Old Slavic phonemes in characteristic positions: &quot;language&quot; is &quot;jazik&quot; (or zajik) in Chakavian and &quot;jezik&quot; in Shtokavian;
* /j/ as in Slovene and Kajkavian where Shtokavian has /dʑ/ ⟨đ⟩: Chakavian, Slovene, Kajkavian &quot;meja&quot;, Shtokavian &quot;međa&quot; (&quot;border&quot;);
* historic /m/ shifted to /n/ at the end of words, unlike in Shtokavian: standard Croatian &quot;volim&quot; (&quot;I love&quot;), &quot;sam&quot; (&quot;I am&quot;), &quot;selom&quot; (&quot;village&quot; - Instrumental case), Chakavian &quot;volin&quot;, &quot;san&quot;, &quot;selon&quot;.
* in conditional occur specific prefixes: &quot;bin-, biš-, bimo-, bite-&quot;, &quot;bis&quot;
* contracted or lacking aorist tense;

The Chakavian dialect is divided along several criteria. In the older literature of Aleksandar Belić, Stjepan Ivšić, Pavle Ivić, Dalibor Brozović and others it was mostly divided into two (Northern and Southern, later, Northwestern and Southeastern) or three main varieties (Northwestern, Central, Southeastern), while in the work by Willem Vermeer and Keith Langston there are three main varieties (Northwestern, Central, Southeastern).

According to the reflex of the Common Slavic phoneme yat */ě/, there are four varieties:
# &quot;Ekavian&quot; (northeastern Istria, Rijeka and Bakar, Cres island): */ě/ &gt; /e/
# &quot;Ikavian–Ekavian&quot; (islands Lošinj, Krk, Rab, Pag, Dugi Otok, Ugljan, mainland Vinodol and Pokupje): */ě/ &gt; /i/ or /e/, according to Jakubinskij&#x27;s law
# &quot;Ikavian&quot; (southwestern Istria, islands Brač, Hvar, Vis, Korčula, Pelješac, Dalmatian coast at Zadar and Split, inland Gacka): */ě/ &gt; /i/
# &quot;Ijekavian&quot; (Lastovo island, Janjina on Pelješac): */ě/ &gt; /je/ or /ije/

Obsolete literature commonly refers to Ikavian–Ekavian dialects as &quot;mixed&quot;, which is a misleading term because the yat reflexes were governed by Jakubinskij&#x27;s law. According to Lisac, division per reflex of yat is most reasonable, although even then exist significant sub-level differences.

According to their tonal (accentual) features, Chakavian dialects are divided into the following groups:
# dialects with the &quot;classical&quot; Chakavian three-tone system
# dialects with two tonic accents
# dialects with four tonic accents similar to that of Shtokavian dialects
# dialects with four-tonic Shtokavian system
# dialects mixing traits of the first and the second group

Using a combination of accentual and phonological criteria, Croatian dialectologists Dalibor Brozović (1988) and Josip Lisac (2009) divide Chakavian into six (sub)dialects:

==Non-palatal tsakavism==
Besides the usual Chakavian (with typical pronoun &quot;ča&quot;), in some Adriatic islands and in eastern Istria another special variant is also spoken which lacks most palatals, with other parallel deviations called &quot;tsakavism&quot; (cakavizam):
* palatal &quot;č&quot; is replaced by the sibilant &quot;ts&quot; (c): pronouns ca and &quot;zac&quot; (or &quot;ce&quot; and &quot;zace&quot;).
* palatals &quot;š&quot; (sh) and &quot;ž&quot; (zh) are replaced by sibilants &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; (or transitive sj and zj).
* &quot;đ&quot; (dj), &quot;lj&quot; and &quot;nj&quot; are replaced by the simple &quot;d, l&quot; and &quot;n&quot; (without iotation).
* Frequent &quot;diphthongs&quot; instead of simple vowels: o &gt; &quot;uo,&quot; a &gt; &quot;oa,&quot; e &gt; &quot;&quot;, etc.
* &quot;Yat&quot; (jat): longer &quot;y&quot; (= ue) exists in addition to the usual short &quot;i&quot; (or e).
* Appurtenance is often noted by possessive &quot;dative&quot; (rarely adjective nor genitive)
* Vocative is mostly lacking and replaced by a nominative in appellating construction.
* Auxiliary particles are always before the main verb: &quot;se-&quot; (self), &quot;bi-&quot; (if), &quot;će-&quot; (be).

The largest area of tsakavism is in eastern Istria at Labin, Rabac and a dozen nearby villages; minor mainland enclaves are the towns Bakar and Trogir. Atavism is also frequent in Adriatic islands: part of Lošinj and nearby islets, Ist, Baška in Krk, Pag town, the western parts of Brač (Milna), Hvar town, and the entire island of Vis with adjacent islets.

The first two features are similar to mazurzenie in Polish, where it is present in many dialects, and tsokanye, occurring in the Old Novgorod dialect.

==Phonology==
The basic phonology of Chakavian, with representation in Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet and IPA, is as follows:

==Chakavian media==
* The biannual periodical &quot;Čakavska rič&quot; (Chakavian Word), with 50 annual volumes, published from 1971 by the Literary Association (&quot;Književni krug&quot;) in Split.
* The annual periodical &quot;Pannonische Jahrbuch&quot; with dozen volumes partly in Chakavian of Burgenland Croats, published since 1994 by the &quot;Pannonisches Institut&quot; in Gutterbach (Burgenland, Austria).
* The annual periodical &quot;Vinodolski zbornik&quot; with a dozen volumes published in Crikvenica, including different texts in the local Chakavian of the Vinodol Valley.
* The annual singing festival &quot;Melodije Istre i Kvarnera&quot; takes place every year in different towns of the Istria and Kvarner regions. Performers perform in local Chakavian dialects exclusively.
* A major perpetual program in the Chakavian of Dalmatia is given by the local television stations in Split, Rijeka, and Pula. Other minor half-Chakavian media with temporary Chakavian contents also include the local radio programs in the cities of Split and Rijeka and Krk island radio.

<doc id="993335" wikidata="Q3656236" url="?curid=993335" title="Feminist history">
<text>Feminist history refers to the re-reading of history from a woman&#x27;s perspective. It is not the same as the history of feminism, which outlines the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. It also differs from women&#x27;s history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women&#x27;s voices and choices in the past. Feminist History seeks to change the nature of history to include gender into all aspects of historical analysis, while also looking through a critical feminist lens. Jill Matthews states &quot;the purpose of that change is political: to challenge the practices of the historical discipline that have belittled and oppressed women, and to create practices that allow women an autonomy and space for self-definition&quot;

Two particular problems which feminist history attempts to address are the exclusion of women from the historical and philosophical tradition, and the negative characterization of women or the feminine therein; however, feminist history is not solely concerned with issues of gender &quot;per se&quot;, but rather with the reinterpretation of history in a more holistic and balanced manner. 
&quot;If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly &quot;natural,&quot; we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission—on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender.&quot; —Susan Pedersen

The &quot;disappearing woman&quot; has been a focus of attention of academic feminist scholarship. Research into women&#x27;s history and literature reveals a rich heritage of neglected culture.

==Understanding feminist history==
Feminist history combines the search for past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women&#x27;s history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman&#x27;s perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also not to be confused with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include &quot;cultural and social investigations&quot; in the job description. Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women&#x27;s lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements.

Feminist historians collect to analyze and analyze to connect. Rather than just recording women&#x27;s history, they allow a connection to be made with &quot;public history.&quot; However, problems remain in integrating this improved history into a curriculum appropriate for students. Finally, feminist historians must now be able to understand the digital humanities involved in creating an online database of their primary sources as well as published works done by notable feminist historians. Feminist digital humanists work with feminist historians to reveal an online integration of the two histories. Harvard&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Studies Database contain sources, like the Gerritsen Collection, that allow scholarly papers by feminists to be written and publicly convey the fact that there is more than one history and the progress made in combining them.

==Relations to women&#x27;s history==
Feminist historians use women&#x27;s history to explore the different voices of past women. This gathering of information requires the help of experts who have dedicated their lives to this pursuit. It provides historians with primary sources that are vital to the integration of histories. Firsthand accounts, like Fiedler&#x27;s And the Walls Come Tumbling Down? (A Feminist View from East Berlin) recounts the daily lives of past women. It documents how their lives were affected by the laws of their government. Women&#x27;s historians go on to interpret how the laws changed these women&#x27;s lives, but feminist historians rely on this information to observe the &#x27;disappearing woman&#x27;. Fieldler even mentioned that &quot;[t]hese feminists were disappointed when they meant ordinary eastern women who were good housewives too, while enjoying outside work.&quot; Because these feminists only knew the public history of the German Democratic Republic, they projected themselves into the imaginary.

Upon investigation of eastern women&#x27;s lives, they found that though the GDR&#x27;s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, there had been no women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler&#x27;s, has allowed women&#x27;s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period is not too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.

==Integrating histories==
Feminist historians see mainly two specific histories. The first is the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second is made up of women&#x27;s history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women&#x27;s History and Regular History that &quot;[his] purpose is to help students understand the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture.&quot; In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he was not learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women&#x27;s contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the &#x27;public&#x27; and the &#x27;domestic&#x27; sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.

Though not all women are politicians or war generals, boys are raised in the domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say &quot;[n]o man can be a good citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.&quot; Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men&#x27;s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women&#x27;s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.

== Feminist historiography ==
Feminist historiography is another notable facet of feminist history. One important feminist historiography writer and researcher is Judith M. Bennett. In her book, &quot;History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism&quot;, Bennett writes on the importance of studying a &quot;patriarchal equilibrium&quot;. Cheryl Glenn also writes on the importance of feminist historiography &quot;Writing women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically and intellectually responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women&#x27;s contributions to public life&quot; This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.

<doc id="993339" wikidata="Q986822" url="?curid=993339" title="Rozvi Empire">
<text>The Rozvi Empire (1490–1866) was a Shona state established on the Zimbabwean Plateau. The term &quot;Rozvi&quot; refers to their legacy as a warrior nation, taken from the Shona term &quot;kurozva&quot;, &quot;to plunder&quot;. They became the most powerful fighting force in the whole of Zimbabwe.

== Name ==
&quot;Changamire&quot; could have been a &quot;portmanteau&quot; of the name &quot;Changa&quot; and &quot;amir&quot; (the title of Mutapa&#x27;s governors).

==History==

=== Changamire I and Mutapa ===
There are conflicting accounts on the origins of the Changamire dynasty. There appear to have intermarriages between the Nembire dynasty of Mutapa and the Torwa dynasty of Butua. According to oral traditions, Changamire was likely a descendant of both dynasties, being either the son of Mutapa&#x27;s second ruler Matope or had married Matope&#x27;s daughter (or both were true and he married his sister as was commonplace in the royal family). He had been appointed governor (&quot;amir&quot;) of the southern portion of the Mutapa Empire (&quot;Guruhuswa&quot;). Diogo de Alcáçova&#x27;s report in 1506 indicates that Changamire I was a member of the Torwa dynasty who had served as a wealthy and influential governor of the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot; (Mutapa king). 

In 1490, Changamire I rebelled against the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot;, his elder brother Nyahuma, and deposed him, reportedly with help from the Torwa. He ruled Mutapa for four years until he was killed by the rightful heir to the throne, reportedly his nephew. His son Changamire II continued the conflict, ruling the southern portion which broke away from the Mutapa Empire. Whether this breakaway state maintained independence or came back under the rule of the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot; is unclear, as we don&#x27;t hear of the Changamire dynasty again until the 17th century.

=== Changamire Dombo ===
In 1683, Portuguese militia tried to take control of the gold trade in the interior of Africa by invading the Rozvi empire. However, the Rozvi, armed with their traditional spears and shields, repelled these attacks and maintained control of the gold mines, until their empire collapsed. The Rozvi were led by Changamire Dombo, and his son Kambgun Dombo whose power was based in Butua in the what is today southwestern Zimbabwe. The Rozvi were formed from several Shona states that dominated the plateau of present-day Zimbabwe. They drove the Portuguese off the central plateau, and the Europeans retained only a nominal presence at one of the fair-towns in the eastern highlands.

Changamire brought the whole of old
-day Zimbabwe under his control, forming a polity that became known as the Rozvi Empire. This powerful kingdom of warriors was to be known as the Rozvi or baLozwi people. They established their capital at Danangombe, also known as Dhlo-Dhlo (in the Northern Ndebele language) 
The administrative power of the Mutapa began to fail to control the whole empire, and tributaries began to exert more independence.

A leader of the people of Guruuswa, given the title Changamire and known as Dombo, became independent from the Mutapa. When the Portuguese tried to colonize them, Changamire Dombo led rebellions against their rule. The area of the Rozvi Empire fluctuated. Its influence extended over much of present-day Zimbabwe, westward into Botswana, and southward into northeastern South Africa. The Rozvi leader Changamire Dombo was originally a herdsman in the Mutapa state, yet managed to drive away the Portuguese, earning himself support and followers, thereby enabling him to break away from the legendary Mutapa empire. Changamire Dombo, according to oral tradition, is believed to have possessed supernatural powers. He was said to be able to turn a white cow into a red one, and more. His magical ability made him feared by people and earned him respect and even more followers. The name Changamire became the honour name of all the kings who followed after him.

The Rozvi&#x27;s political system was hierarchical. Kingship followed a male line and the king was the highest political, religious, military, economic, judicial and social authority, as well as the main distributor of land. The King was helped to rule by an advisory council made of state officials appointed by him; this consisted of his most senior wives, the crown prince, the &quot;tumbare&quot; (regent), religious leaders, military commanders and vassal chiefs. The Rozvi Empire eventually became the most powerful empire in present-day Zimbabwe.

Many tales identify Dombo (&#x27;Rock&#x27;) as Chikura Wadyembeu. Modern scholars agree that this is confusion with another leader of a different people. Rulers of Rozvi State included Chirisa Mhuru and Chikuyo Chisamarenga.

=== Invasions and demise ===
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Rozvi Empire faced several challenges. Like the Mwenemutapa Empire, it was federal in nature, and political tensions between allied kingdoms and the ruling dynasty resulted in some kingdoms (e.g. Manyika) and chieftainships breaking away from the Empire. Internal palace revolutions and constant attacks from the BaMangwato placed increased political pressure on the empire. Two major droughts, 1795 to 1800 and 1824 to 1829, contributed to political instability. Long-standing trading partners like the Portuguese shifted their attention to slaves, thus decreasing demand for gold; thus the Shona tradition of gold mining and trade, which had lasted almost a millennium, declined and so the power of central governments like the Rozvi started to weaken. On top of all the challenges, the 1830s were a time of multiple invasions and wars that the Rozvi Empire never recovered completely from.

In the area of modern-day South Africa, several events resulted in a mass exodus. Drought, invading Dutch settlers and the catastrophic aftermath of the Mfecane resulted in waves of Nguni tribes moving north. Successive attacks on the Empire by the Mpanga, Ngwana, Maseko and Zwangendaba were repelled, but did much damage. Another wave of attacks followed from the group led by the Swazi Queen Nyamazanana, resulting in the capture of the capital Manyanga and the murder of the Rozvi Mambo Chirisamhuru. Contrary to the established narrative, this was not the end of the Rozvi Empire. Chirisamhuru&#x27;s son, Tohwechipi escaped and went into exile in the Buhera area. With the support of the Mutinhima and other Noble Rozvi Houses, Tohwechipi effectively became the Rozvi Mambo.

Mzilikazi realized that although some of the Rozvi nobility had accepted him as King, most of the Shona did not accept him, limiting the geographic area of his Kingdom. Taking a diplomatic approach, he sent word to Tohwechipi asking him to return home and submit to him, crowning him King of the Shona. Tohwechipi did not accept Mzilikazi&#x27;s offer and instead, consolidated his power and spent the next 30 years in a series of back-and-forth raids and counter-raids with Mzilikazi and eventually Lobengula, earning the nickname Chibhamubhamu because of his army of raiders armed with rifles. Tohwechipi was defeated in battle, and surrendered in 1866 and curiously, Mzilikazi let him go. He died around 1873 in the Nyashanu area in Buhera and was buried there in Mavangwe Hills. Tohwechipi&#x27;s grave is a protected national monument.

==Technology and economy==
The economic power of the Rozvi empire was based on cattle herding, farming, and gold mining. Crops included sorghum and millet, and the state depended heavily on subsistence farming. Livestock was important; they kept sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; men who owned much livestock had high social status. Mining was a major branch and was done by men. Internal and external trade were important, especially with Arab traders, exchanging ivory, copper and gold for guns, salt, beads and sea shells.

Rozvi kings revived the tradition of stone building and constructed impressive cities, now known as &#x27;zimbabwes&#x27;, throughout the southwest. Polychrome pottery was also emblematic. Warriors were armed with spears, shields, bows and arrows. Portuguese records show that the Rozvi were sophisticated military strategists. They were noted for using the cow-horn formation years before the great Zulu leader Shaka adopted it in the 19th century. Armed with spears, shields, bows and arrows, the aggressive Rozvi took over the Zimbabwe plateau.

<doc id="993342" wikidata="Q8519299" url="?curid=993342" title="Mount Kineo">
<text>Mount Kineo is a prominent geological feature located on a peninsula that extends from the easterly shore of Moosehead Lake in the northern forest of Maine. With cliffs rising straight up from the water, it is the central feature of Mount Kineo State Park, a protected area of managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.

==History==
; Native American
Native Americans once traveled great distances to Mt. Kineo to acquire its rhyolite rock. This rhyolite is evidence of an igneous (volcanic) phase although the mountain formations also contain slate and sandstone demonstrating sedimentary and metaphoric history as well. The mechanical properties of the rhyolite on Mount Kineo exhibits the physical properties of flint and was used extensively by indigenous peoples to make arrowheads and implements and thus, has often been referred to as &quot;Kineo flint&quot; in literature; but this term misleads by implication that the rhyolite is a cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz derived from a sedimentary origin. The rhyolite is actually an igneous extrusive material implying a volcanic phase that created the unique properties of this highly sought after material. Being the country&#x27;s largest known mass of this rock, once used by Indigenous people to craft arrowheads, hatchets, chisels, etc., Indigenous implements made from the stone have been found in all parts of New England and even further south, it is evident that various tribes visited Mt. Kineo for centuries to obtain this material.
; Notable visitors
In 1846, Henry David Thoreau visited the Moosehead Lake region, and the mountain&#x27;s geological formation, Indian relics and traditions deeply interested him. 
; Hotel resort
The first Mt. Kineo House was built on the shores of Moosehead Lake in 1848, but burned in 1868. Rebuilt in 1870 and opened in 1871, the second Mt. Kineo House burned again in 1882. Designed by Arthur H. Vinal, the third Mt. Kineo House opened in 1884.

In 1911, the Maine Central Railroad purchased the resort and engaged the Hiram Ricker Hotel Company to operate it. Then the largest inland waterfront hotel in America, it had accommodations for over 500 guests. In 1933, the railroad eliminated its Kineo branch, and in 1938 sold the hotel. It burned during demolition and the old employee house was burned down in 2018.

==Features==
;State park
The state park offers various trails around the peninsula and to the mountain peak. The park can only be reached by water. The Mount Kineo Golf Course operates the seasonal water shuttle service from the public dock in Rockwood to Mount Kineo. The park is one of five Maine State Parks that was in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with 3 minutes and 24 seconds of totality.
;Golf course
Mount Kineo Golf Course is believed to be the second oldest in New England. It came under new ownership in 2009. Played on the original 1893 course, the classic lakeside layout has no sand traps, small greens, and the Kineo cliff as a backdrop for the scenic over-the-water par 3 hole #4.

<text>The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) is the body that writes the rules of competition for most high school sports and activities in the United States. NFHS&#x27;s headquarters are located in White River State Park in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Member and affiliate associations==

Over 19,500 high schools belong to associations that are members of the NFHS. Most high schools, whether public or private, belong to their state&#x27;s high school association; in turn, each state association belongs to the NFHS. However, in states that have separate associations for public and non-public high schools, only the public-school bodies are full NFHS members.

For example, the Texas University Interscholastic League (public schools, with non-public schools generally not allowed) is a full member; the largest association governing non-public schools, the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, is an affiliate member, while other governing bodies are not NFHS members at any level. Similarly, the Virginia High School League, open only to public schools, is a full member, the state&#x27;s largest association for non-public schools is an affiliate member, and other governing bodies are not members at all.

The case in Mississippi is slightly different; the body governing public schools is a full member, while the body governing private schools is not an NFHS member at any level. In the state of Alabama, the public schools and a handful of private schools compete in the AHSAA (Alabama High School Athletic Association) which is a full member of the NFHS. The majority of private schools in the state are members of the AISA (Alabama Independent School Association) a non-member that uses NFHS rules. The AHSAA will not allow its members to play AISA schools but the AISA schools do compete with public and private schools outside of Alabama.

Iowa has separate governing associations for boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; sports, including the Iowa High School Athletic Association and the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union. Only the Iowa High School Athletic Association is a full member of the NFHS; the girls&#x27; governing body is an affiliate member.

The provincial associations of Canada are affiliate members of the NFHS.

The NFHS publishes rules books for each sport or activity, and most states adopt those rules wholly for state high school competition including the non member private school associations.

The NFHS offered an online Coach Education Program in January 2007. It released a course, Fundamentals of Coaching. The NFHS has announced that it will offer a National Coach Certification in September 2009. This will enable to coaches to become a Level 1 - Accredited Interscholastic Coach issued by the NFHS.

<text>Reputation management, refers to the influencing, controlling, enhancing, or concealing of an individual&#x27;s or group&#x27;s reputation. It is a marketing technique used to modify a company&#x27;s reputation in a positive way. The growth of the internet and social media led to growth of reputation management companies, with search results as a core part of a client&#x27;s reputation. Online reputation management (ORM) involves overseeing and influencing the search engine results related to products and services.

Ethical grey areas include mug shot removal sites, astroturfing customer review sites, censoring complaints, and using search engine optimization tactics to influence results. In other cases, the ethical lines are clear; some reputation management companies are closely connected to websites that publish unverified and libelous statements about people. Such unethical companies charge thousands of dollars to remove these posts – temporarily – from their websites.

The field of public relations has evolved with the rise of the internet and social media. Reputation management is now broadly categorized into two areas: online reputation management and offline reputation management.

Online reputation management focuses on the management of product and service search results within the digital space. A variety of electronic markets and online communities like eBay, Amazon and Alibaba have ORM systems built in, and using effective control nodes can minimize the threat and protect systems from possible misuses and abuses by malicious nodes in decentralized overlay networks. Big Data has the potential to be employed in overseeing and enhancing the reputation of organizations.

Offline reputation management shapes public perception of a said entity outside the digital sphere. Popular controls for off-line reputation management include social responsibility, media visibility, press releases in print media and sponsorship amongst related tools.

==History==
Reputation is a social construct based on the opinion other people hold about a person or thing. Before the internet was developed, consumers wanting to learn about a company had fewer options. They had access to resources such as the Yellow Pages, but mostly relied on word-of-mouth. A company&#x27;s reputation depended on personal experience. A company while it grew and expanded was subject to the market&#x27;s perception of the brand. Public relations were developed to manage the image and manage the reputation of a company or individual. The concept was initially created to broaden public relations outside of media relations. Academic studies have identified it as a driving force behind Fortune 500 corporate public relations since the beginning of the 21st century.

As of 1988, reputation management was acknowledged as a valuable intangible asset and corporate necessity, which can be one of the most important sources of competitive edge in a fiercely competitive market, and with firms under scrutiny from the business community, regulators, and corporate governance watchdogs; good reputation management practices would to help firms cope with this scrutiny.

As of 2006, reputation management practices reinforce and aid a corporation&#x27;s branding objectives. Good reputation management practices are helping any entity manage staff confidence as a control tool on public perceptions which if undermined and ignored can be costly, which in the long run may cripple employee confidence, a risk no employer would dare explore as staff morale is one of the most important drivers of company performance.

===Online ===

Originally, public relations included printed media, events and networking campaigns. At the end of 1990s search engines became widely used. The popularity of the internet introduced new marketing and branding opportunities. Where once journalists were the main source of media content, blogs, review sites and social media gave a voice to consumers regardless of qualification. Public relations became part of online reputation management (ORM). ORM includes traditional reputation strategies of public relations but also focuses on building a long-term reputation strategy that is consistent across all web-based channels and platforms. ORM includes search engine reputation management which is designed to counter negative search results and elevate positive content.
Reputation management (sometimes referred to as &quot;rep management&quot; or &quot;ORM&quot;) is the practice of attempting to shape public perception of a person or organization by influencing information about that entity, primarily online. What necessitates this shaping of perceptions being the role of consumers in any organization and the cognizance of how much if ignored these perceptions may harm a company&#x27;s performance at any time of the year, a risk no entrepreneur or company executive can afford.

Specifically, reputation management involves the monitoring of the reputation of an individual or a brand on the internet, primarily focusing on the various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. addressing content which is potentially damaging to it, and using customer feedback to try to solve problems before they damage the individual&#x27;s or brand&#x27;s reputation. A major part of reputation management involves suppressing negative search results, while highlighting positive ones. For businesses, reputation management usually involves an attempt to bridge the gap between how a company perceives itself and how others view it.

In 2012, there had been an article released titled &quot;Social Media Research in Advertising, Communication, Marketing and Public Relations&quot; written by Hyoungkoo Khang et-al. The references to Kaplan and Haenleins theory of social presence, highlights the &quot;concept of self-presentation.&quot;

Khang highlights that &quot;companies must monitor individual&#x27;s comments regarding service 24/7.&quot; This can imply that the reputation of a company does essentially rely on the consumer, as they are the ones that can make or break it. A 2015 study commissioned by the American Association of Advertising Agencies concluded that 4 percent of consumers believed advertisers and marketers practice integrity.

According to Susan Crawford, a cyberlaw specialist from Cardozo Law School, most websites will remove negative content when contacted to avoid litigation. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that in some cases, writing a letter to a detractor can have unintended consequences, though the company makes an effort to avoid writing to certain website operators that are likely to respond negatively. The company says it respects the First Amendment and does not try to remove &quot;genuinely newsworthy speech.&quot; It generally cannot remove major government-related news stories from established publications or court records.

In 2015, Jon Ronson, author of &quot;So You&#x27;ve Been Publicly Shamed&quot;, said that reputation management helped some people who became agoraphobic due to public humiliation from online shaming, but that it was an expensive service that many could not afford.

==Campaigns in popular media==

In 2011, controversy around the Taco Bell restaurant chain arose when public accusations were made that their &quot;seasoned beef&quot; product was only made up of only 35% real beef. A class action lawsuit was filed by the law firm Beasley Allen against Taco Bell. The suit was voluntarily withdrawn with Beasley Allen citing that &quot;From the inception of this case, we stated that if Taco Bell would make certain changes regarding disclosure and marketing of its &#x27;seasoned beef&#x27; product, the case could be dismissed.&quot; Taco Bell responded to the case being withdrawn by launching a reputation management campaign titled &quot;Would it kill you to say you&#x27;re sorry?&quot; that ran advertisements in various news outlets in print and online, which attempted to draw attention to the voluntary withdrawal of the case.

In 2015, Volkswagen, a german automobile manufacturer, faced a massive €30 billion controversy. A scandal erupted when it was revealed that 11 million of its vehicles globally had been fitted with devices designed to mask the true levels of harmful emissions. The reaction from the company&#x27;s investors was swift as Volkswagen&#x27;s stock value started to fall rapidly. The brand released a two-minute video in which the CEO and other representatives apologized after pleading guilty. However, this wasn&#x27;t enough to change the public perception. The automotive giant had to bring in four PR firms led by Hering Schuppener, a German crisis communications and reputation management agency. To rebuild its reputation, Volkswagen launched an initiative to transition to electric motors on an unprecedented scale. The company released print media and published pieces in top publications to show its commitment to developing electric and hybrid vehicle models worldwide, which helped improve its CSR image.

Starbucks, the coffeehouse chain, also faced reputation damage in response to the arrests of two African-American men at its Philadelphia branch. In response to a request to use the bathroom, the branch&#x27;s manager denied the two men&#x27;s access since they hadn&#x27;t bought anything, calling the police when they refused to leave. The incident sparked massive public outrage and boycotts across the country. SYPartners, a business reputation consultancy, was engaged to provide Starbucks leadership with advice after the incident. Starbucks issued an apology, which was circulated across top media publications. The company also initiated an anti-bias training for its 175,00 employees across 8,000 locations. Starbucks also changed its policy, allowing people to sit without making a purchase. Both men also reached a settlement with Starbucks and the city.

In 2024, a London restaurant was review bombed by a cybercrime group to extort £10,000. The negative reviews brought the eatery&#x27;s Google rating down to 2.3 stars from a 4.9 stars before the attack. Maximatic Media, an online reputation management firm, was hired to identify the origin of the malicious reviews and found that they were being generated by a botnet. The agency worked with Google for the removal of these fake reviews to restore the restaurant&#x27;s online reputation to a 4.8-star rating.

==Examples==
Organisations attempt to manage their reputations on websites that many people visit, such as eBay, Wikipedia, and Google. Some of the tactics used by reputation management firms include:

* Modifying the way results from searches are displayed on a search engine such as white papers and make appear in priority positive customer testimonials in order to push down negative content.
* Publishing original, positive websites and social media profiles, with the aim of outperforming negative results in a search.
* Submitting online press releases to authoritative websites in order to promote brand presence and suppress negative content.
* Submitting legal take-down requests if they have or pretend to have been libeled.
* Getting mentions of the business or individual on third-party sites that rank highly on Google.
* Creating fake, positive reviews of the individual or business to counteract negative ones.
* Using spambots and denial-of-service attacks to force sites with damaging content off the web entirely.
* Astroturfing third-party websites by creating anonymous accounts that create positive reviews or lash out against negative ones.
* Proactively offering free products to prominent reviewers.
* Removing online mug shots.
* Proactively responding to public criticism stemming from recent changes.
* Removing or suppressing images that are embarrassing or violate copyright.
* Wikiturfing, also called wikiwashing, in which corporations contact Wikipedia editors to remove allegedly incorrect information from the Wikipedia pages of businesses they represent, and &quot;obfuscating... their role of profit seeking corporations...[and] promoting a misleading image of themselves associated with the general values of wikis and Wikipedia&quot;.
* Forbidding any comments

==Ethics==

The practice of reputation management raises many ethical questions. It is widely disagreed upon where the line for disclosure, astroturfing, and censorship should be drawn. Firms have been known to hire staff to pose as bloggers on third-party sites without disclosing they were paid, and some have been criticized for asking websites to remove negative posts. The exposure of unethical reputation management may itself be risky to the reputation of a firm that attempts it if known.

In 2007 Google declared there to be nothing inherently wrong with reputation management, and even introduced a toolset in 2011 for users to monitor their online identity and request the removal of unwanted content. Many firms are selective about clients they accept. For example, they may avoid individuals who committed violent crimes who are looking to push information about their crimes lower on search results.

In 2010, a study showed that Naymz, one of the first Web 2.0 services to provide utilities for Online Reputation Management (ORM), had developed a method to assess the online reputation of its members (RepScore) that was rather easy to deceive. The study found that the highest level of online reputation was easily achieved by engaging a small social group of nine persons who connect with each other and provide reciprocal positive feedbacks and endorsements. As of December 2017, Naymz was shut down.

In 2015, the online retailer Amazon.com sued 1,114 people who were paid to publish fake five-star reviews for products. These reviews were created using a website for Macrotasking, Fiverr.com. Several other companies offer fake Yelp and Facebook reviews, and one journalist amassed five-star reviews for a business that doesn&#x27;t exist, from social media accounts that have also given overwhelmingly positive reviews to &quot;a chiropractor in Arizona, a hair salon in London, a limo company in North Carolina, a realtor in Texas, and a locksmith in Florida, among other far-flung businesses&quot;. In 2007, a study by the University of California Berkeley found that some sellers on eBay were undertaking reputation management by selling products at a discount in exchange for positive feedback to game the system.

In 2016, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; detailed 25 court cases, at least 15 of which had false addresses for the defendant. The court cases had similar language and the defendant agreed to the injunction by the plaintiff, which allowed the reputation management company to issue takedown notices to Google, Yelp, Leagle, Ripoff Report, various news sites, and other websites.

<doc id="993360" wikidata="Q428757" url="?curid=993360" title="Ian St John">
<text>John &quot;Ian&quot; St John (; 7 June 1938 – 1 March 2021) was a Scottish professional football player, coach and broadcaster. St John played as a forward for Liverpool throughout most of the 1960s. Signed by Bill Shankly in 1961, St John was a key member of the Liverpool team that emerged from the second tier of English football to win two league titles and one FA Cup—in which he scored the winner in the 1965 final—to cement a position as one of the country&#x27;s top sides. He played for Scotland 21 times, scoring nine goals.

He later became a manager – including at his hometown team Motherwell where he had begun his playing career – and a media pundit. He co-presented the topical football show &quot;Saint and Greavsie&quot; with Jimmy Greaves from 1985 to 1992. In 2008, he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.

==Career==
===Motherwell===
St John was one of six children. Their father, Alex, a steelworker, died when Ian was six years old. Ian also showed talent for boxing as a boy, but his mother discouraged it. Having played football for youth sides and works teams as a teenager while working in local industry, including at the Colville steelworks, St John began his career at boyhood favourites Motherwell, signing as a professional in 1957 after a spell with affiliated junior team Douglas Water Thistle as a provisional signing; he continued a part-time engineering apprenticeship (work which he admitted he disliked and actively avoided as much as possible) for a further two years.

He was managed by Bobby Ancell, and was part of a group of talented young players (also including Andy Weir, Willie Hunter, Pat Quinn and Sammy Reid) that were nicknamed the &quot;Ancell Babes&quot;. His debut was against Dumfries side Queen of the South in an away fixture at Palmerston Park. St John scored a hat-trick for Motherwell in two minutes and 30 seconds against Hibernian in 1959, one of the fastest recorded in Scottish football history. He left Motherwell in 1961, having scored 105 goals in 144 appearances for the club in the three major Scottish domestic competitions.

===Liverpool===
On 2 May 1961 he was transferred to Liverpool for a transfer fee of £37,500, () setting a new club record. He was brought to the club by manager Bill Shankly, who was preparing for the 1961–62 season with the club still in the Second Division. Many years later, after Shankly&#x27;s retirement as manager, he described St John&#x27;s arrival at the club – along with that of Ron Yeats during the same summer – as the &quot;turning point&quot; for the club as they began their transformation into one of Europe&#x27;s top footballing sides.

St John made his debut for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby against Everton in the Liverpool Senior Cup. Although Liverpool lost 4–3, he announced his arrival in spectacular style by scoring all three of his side&#x27;s goals. He scored a total of 18 goals in his first season for Liverpool, and played in all but two matches. His official debut came in a 2–0 league victory against Bristol Rovers at the Eastville Stadium on 19 August 1961, and his first official goals came 11 days later when he scored twice in a 4–1 win over Sunderland at Roker Park. His strike partner Roger Hunt got the other two goals.

Along with Ron Yeats, St John was brought in to turn around Liverpool&#x27;s luck as they had been stuck in the Second Division for seven years, narrowly missing out on promotion in six of those seasons. The purchases paid dividends as Liverpool comfortably won the Second Division title by eight points over nearest challengers Leyton Orient. St John played 40 times that season and scored 18 goals. They finished in a respectable 8th place in their first season back in the top flight, 1962–63, and also reached the FA Cup semi-finals.

Liverpool then produced a surprise by winning the league championship in 1963–64, overturning a 17-point deficit to win the title by four points over Manchester United and five over reigning champions Everton, St John played a major role in the title success by scoring 21 goals, which was his highest total in a season for the club. His most important goal for Liverpool came a year later, a diving header past Leeds goalkeeper Gary Sprake in extra time of the 1965 FA Cup Final. This goal won the FA Cup for Liverpool, the first time in the club&#x27;s history that it had won the trophy.

Another league championship followed in the 1965–66 season, as Liverpool finished six points clear of Leeds. St John chipped in with 10 goals from 41 outings. Liverpool also reached their first European final, as Borussia Dortmund beat them 2–1 in the 1966 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final at Hampden Park.

Like the vast majority of Bill Shankly&#x27;s first great team, St John was at his peak during the mid-1960s. He continued to play regularly during the later 1960s, mainly playing in a deeper position. As he entered his thirties his form and fitness began to dip, and he was eventually dropped from the team by Shankly. St John was a reserve team player in 1970–71, and he left Liverpool on 25 August 1971, after playing 425 games and scoring 118 goals for the club.

===Coventry City and Tranmere Rovers===
St John played for South African club Hellenic during the middle of 1971. After his return to England in August 1971, he was transferred to Coventry City. After a short spell with Tranmere Rovers, then managed by Ron Yeats, he retired from playing football in 1973.

===International career===
St John was selected to play for Scotland 21 times, making his debut in a 3–2 friendly victory against West Germany at Hampden Park on 6 May 1959. The first of his 9 international goals came a year later, again at Hampden, but this time in a 3–2 friendly defeat at the hands of Poland on 4 May 1960. He scored twice in a 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification playoff match against Czechoslovakia in November 1961, but Scotland lost 4–2 after extra time and did not qualify for the World Cup finals.

==After playing==
After retiring from playing, St John managed both his former club Motherwell (1973–1974) and Portsmouth (1974–1977, assisted by former Motherwell teammate Willie Hunter). He also served as assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City. As Motherwell manager, St John sold goalkeeper Keith MacRae and gave a debut to young forward Willie Pettigrew. Motherwell finished ninth in the 1973–74 season, his only term in charge.

After leaving Sheffield Wednesday in 1979, St John became a football pundit. He struck up a successful TV partnership with fellow ex-footballer Jimmy Greaves, with their &quot;Saint and Greavsie&quot; programme running from 1985 until 1992. He also set up several football academies for the coaching of younger players called the Ian St John Soccer Camps. Liverpool twice ran a fan poll of their favourite Liverpool players, &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;; St John finished 21st in 2006 and 33rd in 2013.

==Illness and death==
In June 2014, St John announced that he had undergone surgery for bladder cancer in April of that year, removing his bladder and prostate gland. He died on 1 March 2021 at Arrowe Park Hospital after a long illness, aged 82.

<doc id="993361" wikidata="Q710677" url="?curid=993361" title="Austin Bradford Hill">
<text>Sir Austin Bradford Hill (8 July 1897 – 18 April 1991) was an English epidemiologist who pioneered the modern randomised clinical trial and, together with Richard Doll, demonstrated the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Hill is widely known for the &quot;Bradford Hill&quot; criteria for determining a causal association.

==Early life==

Hill was born in London, son of Sir Leonard Erskine Hill FRS, a distinguished physiologist, and Janet Alexander. He was the grandson of noted scholar George Birkbeck Hill. As a child he lived at the family home, Osborne House, Loughton, Essex; he was educated at Chigwell School, Essex. He served as a pilot in the First World War but was invalided out when he contracted tuberculosis. Two years in hospital and two years of convalescence put a medical qualification out of the question and he took a degree in economics by correspondence at London University.

==Career==

In 1922, Hill went to work for the Industry Fatigue Research Board. He was associated with the medical statistician Major Greenwood and, to improve his statistical knowledge, Hill attended lectures by Karl Pearson. When Greenwood accepted a chair at the newly formed London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Hill moved with him, becoming Reader in Epidemiology and Vital Statistics in 1933 and Professor of Medical Statistics in 1947. In 1947, he was appointed Honorary Director of the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Statistical Research Unit.

Hill had a distinguished career in research and teaching and as author of a very successful textbook, &quot;Principles of Medical Statistics&quot;, but he is famous for two landmark studies. He was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, is generally accepted as the first modern randomised clinical trial. The use of randomisation in agricultural experiments had been pioneered by Ronald Aylmer Fisher. The second study was rather a series of studies with Richard Doll on smoking and lung cancer. The first paper, published in 1950, was a case-control study comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls. Doll and Hill also started a long-term prospective study of smoking and health. This was an investigation of the smoking habits and health of 40,701 British doctors for several years (British doctors study). Fisher was in profound disagreement with the conclusions and procedures of the smoking/cancer work and from 1957 he criticised the work in the press and in academic publications.

In 1965, built upon the work of Hume and Popper, Hill suggested several aspects of causality in medicine and biology, which have remained in use by epidemiologists to date.

On Hill&#x27;s death in 1991, Peter Armitage wrote, &quot;to anyone involved in medical statistics, epidemiology or public health, Bradford Hill was quite simply the world&#x27;s leading medical statistician.&quot;

==Honours==
In 1950–52, Hill was president of the Royal Statistical Society. He was awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1953, and the Harben Gold Medal of the Institute of Public
Health and Hygiene. The Society awards a medal in the field of medical statistics in Hill&#x27;s name.

Hill was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. Fisher was one of the proposers. The certificate of election read:

Has, by the application of statistical methods, made valuable contributions to our knowledge of the incidence and aetiology of industrial diseases, of the effects of internal migration upon mortality rates, and of the natural and experimental epidemiology of various infections, for example of the risks of an attack of poliomyelitis following inoculation procedures and of the risk of congenital abnormalities being precipitated by maternal rubella in the pregnant woman. Since the war he has demonstrated in an exact and controlled field survey the association between cigarette smoking and the incidence of cancer of the lung, and has been the leader in the development in medicine of the precise experimental methods now used nationally and internationally in the evaluation of new therapeutic and prophylactic agents.
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1951 Birthday Honours and knighted in the 1961 Birthday Honours.

<text>&quot;The Man of Law&#x27;s Tale&quot; is the fifth of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer, written around 1387. John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Constance&quot; in &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; tells the same story and may have been a source for Chaucer. Nicholas Trivet&#x27;s &quot;Les chronicles&quot; was a source for both authors.

Wurtele provides a detailed compilation of the differences between Trivet&#x27;s Chronicle and the poems of Gower and Chaucer. Gower strove for vividness and shortened the tale in places. Chaucer expanded the tale and emphasizes the holiness of Constance and how she was favoured by heaven.

Hagiographic motifs are most abundant in Chaucer&#x27;s version, e.g. “the miracles God works though Custance and the way she is miraculously fed while at sea”. Wurtele observes that Chaucer makes frequent use of the adjective &quot;hooly&quot; but Gower never uses this word.

==Synopsis==
(References here are to line numbers in both Man of Law&#x27;s Tale (MLT) and Confessio Amantis (CA).)

Constance (Custance in Chaucer) is the daughter of the emperor in Rome. Syrian merchants report her great beauty to the Sultan. A marriage contract is negotiated by her father which requires the Sultan and his subjects to convert to Christianity.MLT or CA

The Sultan&#x27;s mother, enraged that her son would turn his back on Islam, connives to prevent this by massacring her son and the wedding party and having Constance set adrift on the sea. MLT or CA Constance&#x27;s adventures and trials continue after she is shipwrecked on the Northumberland coast. The validity of her Christian faith is proved by two miracles. Her companion Hermengyld heals a blind man.MLT or CA A wicked knight who wishes to seduce Constance murders Hermengyld and attempts to frame Constance using the bloody dagger. He perjures himself and is mysteriously struck dead. MLT or CA Northumberland is a nominally pagan country where the King, Alla (based on Chaucer&#x27;s understanding of the historical Ælla of Deira) converted to Christianity after learning of the two miracles. Alla&#x27;s evil mother intercepts and falsifies letters between the Alla and his constable, which results in Constance&#x27;s being banished. MLT or CA 

Constance is forced to go to sea again and encounters one final antagonist. She runs aground in Spain; a would-be rapist (Thelous in CA) boards her ship but mysteriously falls overboard. MLT or CA She is found by a Senator of Rome, who is returning from a mission to Barberie (Syria) where he revenged the slaughter of Christians by the Sultan&#x27;s mother. MLT or CA The Senator takes Constance (and her child) back to Italy to serve as a household servant. King Alla, still heartbroken over the loss of Constance, goes to Rome on a pilgrimage, and fortunately finds Constance. The couple returns to Northumberland. Alla dies a year later, Constance returns to Rome, and their son becomes the Emperor of Rome. MLT or CA

==Character of the Man of Law==
The Man of Law may have been based upon a real character. Two candidates are Thomas Pynchbek and Gower. Pynchbek &quot;served as a justice of assize between 1376 and 1388 and was known for his acquisition of land, as well as for his learning; in 1388, as chief baron of the Exchequer, he signed a writ for GC&#x27;s arrest in a case of debt&quot;. Accepting the latter requires accepting the debatable claim that Gower was a practiced lawyer. Yeager asserts that Gower had a &quot;lawyerly habit of mind&quot; but there is no evidence that he received formal training in the law. Chaucer himself is another candidate. Yet another view is taken by David who sees the Man of Law as
&quot;a representative of the self-appointed poetry critics with whom Chaucer disagreed.

==Man of Law as narrator==
===Introduction===
The Man of Law (referred to here as &#x27;A Sergeant of the Lawe&#x27;) is a judicious and dignified man, or, at least, he seems so because of his wise words. He is a judge in the court of assizes (civil procedures), by letter of appointment from the king, and has many goods and robes. He can draw up a legal document, the narrator tells us, and &quot;no wight pinchen at his writing&quot;. The Man of Law rides in informal, silk-adorned clothes. GP The Host addresses the Man of Law with more respect than he does the Miller and the Reeve. The Man of Law&#x27;s response to the host includes &quot;behest [promise] is debt&quot; which is a quotation from Justinian.

Whatever the identity of the narrator, his knowledge of literature is erratic. Some of the Chaucerian works have not been &#x27;published&#x27;, which suggests he is part of Chaucer&#x27;s literary circle. He confuses the Muses with the Pierides. Antiochus did not throw his daughter to the ground. The most debated passage in the Introduction is: 
:But certeinly no word ne writeth he
:Of thilke wikke [wicked] ensample of Canacee,
:That loved hir owene brother synfully –
:Of swiche cursed stories I sey fy! –
:Or ellis of Tyro Appollonius,
:How that the cursed kyng Antiochus
:Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,
:That is so horrible a tale for to rede,
:Whan he hir threw upon the pavement.
Gower retold these two stories in Confessio. David observes that MLT is placed after somewhat immoral tales told by the Miller, the Reeve and the Cook. After Gower became aware of this passage, the Epilogue of Confessio was altered to remove praise of Chaucer. The three common interpretations are:
* Gower was offended by this criticism and deliberately excised the praise of Chaucer which appears in the first recension of CA.
* Macaulay argues the excision was an editing error, which was corrected in a subsequent recension of Confessio.
* Fisher took the view that &quot;moral Gower&quot; was offended by the immoral tales found in the Canterbury Tales.

===Tale===
The narrator of the tale is less materialistic than the Sergeant of the Introduction (the description of the merchants&#x27; wealth is an exception ). &quot;The tale, on the other hand, quite clearly reveals its narrator to be a devotee of justice in some ideal order, rather than a legal technician grown wealthy through sharp practices.&quot; The events of the tale are the crimes discussed in Bracton&#x27;s De legibus. &quot;Simply from this point of view, and with respect to both style and substance, the received story as an aggregation of incidents is well suit for retelling by a Sergeant of the Law.&quot; &quot;Tortuous&quot;MLT an astrological term may be confused with &quot;tortious&quot; which is a legal term. Apostrophe is used in several places. Another marked stylistic trait is his use of those rhetorical questions which punctuate with the regularity of a refrain the two passages (and ) emphasizing at some length the dangers that beset Constance when she is at the sultaness&#x27; feast, when she is drifting from Syria to Northumberland, and when the second miscreant assaults her.

Some scholars disagree with the arguments given above.
Spearing downplays the notion that the narration is the voice of a lawyer. Pearsall found nothing specific to a lawyer other than the response to the Host in the Introduction.

==Sources==
The tale is based on a story within the &quot;Chronicles&quot; of Nicholas Trivet but the major theme in the tale, of an exiled princess uncorrupted by her suffering, was common in the literature of the time. Her tale is also told in John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, and both are similar to the verse Romance &quot;Emaré&quot;, and the cycle is generally known as the &quot;Constance&quot; cycle. The oldest known variant of this particular type is &quot;Vitae duorum Offarum&quot;. More distantly related forms of the persecuted heroine include &quot;Le Bone Florence of Rome&quot;, and &quot;Griselda&quot;. An incident where Constance is framed for murder by a bloody dagger appears to be a direct borrowing from &quot;Crescentia&quot;.


==Sequence with other tales==
The tale is the first in Fragment 2. Fragment 1 contains tales told by the Knight, Miller, Reeve and Cook. The various manuscripts of the &quot;Tales&quot; differ in the sequence of the tales. 35 manuscripts contain the Man of Law&#x27;s epilogue, while 22 others (including the Ellesmere Manuscript) do not. In the epilogue, the host invites the Parson to speak next, but the Parson is interrupted before he can begin and a different speaker tells the next tale. In the various manuscripts, the interrupter is Summoner, the Squire, or the Shipman, but it is the Shipman whose character best matches the rude remarks (although the mention of his &quot;joly body&quot; sounds closer to something the Wife of Bath might say). What this probably shows is that Chaucer had not fixed his overall plan. There are also hints, with his claim he will talk in prose despite rhyming throughout, that the Man of Law originally told the Tale of Melibee before he was assigned Custance&#x27;s tale late in the composition of the &quot;Tales&quot;.

<text>Zvishavane, formerly known as Shabani, is a mining town in Midlands Province, Zimbabwe. Surrounded by low hills, it lies west of Masvingo, on the main Bulawayo-Masvingo road. Other roads lead from Zvishavane to Gweru, north, and Mberengwa, south-west. It is also on direct rail links to Gweru and Beit Bridge which then link up with Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and to Maputo in Mozambique, and Pretoria in South Africa. It has a private airport serving the city.

==Name==
Zvishavane was formerly called &quot;Shabanie&quot; (used by the mine) or &quot;Shabani&quot; (used for the town). The name is derived from the Shona adjective for reddish, referring to the hills around the town.

==History==

The town developed as a residential centre for Shabani Mine, which started operations in 1916 to supply asbestos during the First World War. Growth was slow due to poor communications until the railway reached the town in 1928. Although the asbestos mine is the biggest producer of the mineral in Zvishavane, platinum, gold, beryl, chromite, iron ore at Buchwa and huge deposits of diamond at Murowa are also mined in the area.

The surrounding area is dominated by cattle ranching, while peasant agriculture is practiced in the nearby communal lands of Mberengwa and Buchwa.

The administration of Zvishavane has developed over the years to keep pace with its growth. A Village Management Board was set up in 1921 and replaced with a Town Management Board in 1930. It was granted municipal status in 1968.

==Population==

The population of Zvishavane has grown substantially in recent decades due to a boom in mining activity. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 26,758. By 1992, this had risen to 32,984. The population grew further to 35,128 in 2002 and was 45,325 in 2012.

== Major Companies ==
* Mimosa Mining Company
* Shabanie Mine
* Sabi Gold Mine
* Murowa Diamonds
* Pote Holdings
* Midlands State University
* TK engineering

== Transports ==

<text>The University of Toulouse (, ) is a community of universities and establishments (ComUE) based in Toulouse, France. Originally it was established in 1229, making it one of the earliest universities to emerge in Europe. Suppressed during the French Revolution in 1793, it was refounded in 1896 as part of the reorganization of higher education. It was finally abolished in 1969, giving birth to the three current universities: Toulouse 1 Capitole University, University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès and Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University. The ComUE in the Toulouse region was known as Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. On January 1, 2023, the university was renamed as the University of Toulouse.

The three universities, along with other institutions, participated in the reconstruction of the University of Toulouse – a joint structure of 107,000 students including 4,500 doctoral students, 17,000 staffs and 145 research laboratories. The mission was entrusted to Patrick Lévy, former president of the Grenoble Alpes University, accompanied by Philippe Raimbault, president of the Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. This development, strongly desired by the elected officials of the Occitania region and Toulouse Métropole, aims to give greater visibility to Toulouse higher education in international rankings.

==History==
The formation of the University of Toulouse was imposed on Count Raymond VII as a part of the Treaty of Paris in 1229 ending the crusade against the Albigensians. As he was suspected of sympathizing with the heretics, Raymond VII had to finance the teaching of theology. Bishop Foulques de Toulouse was among the founders of the university. Among its first lecturers were Jean de Garlande and Roland of Cremona. Other faculties (law, medicine) were added later. Initially, the university was located in the center of the city, together with the ancestors of student residences, the colleges.

In 1969, the University of Toulouse split into three separate universities and numerous specialised institutions of higher education. The three universities are: Toulouse 1 Capitole University, University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès and Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University.

The university system was founded on 27 March 2007. It no longer represented a single university, it was the collective entity (PRES) which federated the universities and institutions of higher education in Toulouse region. With more than 100,000 students, Midi-Pyrénées is the fifth-largest university area in France. 

The current university system was created as a ComUE according to the 2013 Law on Higher Education and Research (France), effective on July 1, 2015. It replaced the pôle de recherche et d&#x27;enseignement supérieur (PRES) which had been organized in 2007 to coordinate higher education and research in the region.

In 2021, Patrick Lévy conducted an audit of the university site, which proposed changes. In 2022, this process led to the evolution of the institution towards the status of an experimental ComUE. On January 1, 2023, the Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées became the University of Toulouse.

<doc id="993373" wikidata="Q2698925" url="?curid=993373" title="Rickettsia rickettsii">
<text>Rickettsia rickettsii is a Gram-negative, intracellular, cocco-bacillus bacterium that was first discovered in 1902. Having a reduced genome, the bacterium harvests nutrients from its host cell to carry out respiration, making it an organo-heterotroph. Maintenance of its genome is carried out through vertical gene transfer where specialization of the bacterium allows it to shuttle host sugars directly into its TCA cycle.

Other characteristics of the bacteria include membrane proteins that are useful in the identification of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; strains and useful in targeting from antibiotics. A capsule encircling the bacterium allows for attachment to host cells and additionally acts as a defense mechanism for resisting phagocytosis. Varying strains of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; have different genotypes and phenotypes that alter the pathogenicity, virulence, and the appearance of the bacteria.

&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is the causative agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and is transferred to its host via a tick bite. It is one of the most pathogenic &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species and affects a large majority of the Western Hemisphere, most commonly the Americas. The pathogenic agent has been found on every continent, except Antarctica; however, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever occurs mostly in North, Central, and South America. This prevalence is due to &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; ability to thrive in warm, damp environments. These environments provide sufficient conditions for the amplification of the bacteria within a vertebrate host, such as a horse or dog. The bacteria are transmitted through a vector, such as a tick, to a vertebrate host where it can then be amplified and passed on to a person, resulting in the zoonotic disease.

Headache, high fever, and spotted rash are some effects of the disease with more severe cases resulting in organ damage and coma. Antibiotics, such as doxycycline, target the ribosome of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in order to inhibit protein synthesis of the bacteria, providing a form of treatment for the disease.

== Physiology ==

=== Metabolic pathways ===
&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; are obligate intracellular bacteria, meaning they need a host cell in order to replicate and survive. In fact, no glycolytic enzymes for the breakdown of intact glucose remain in &quot;R. rickettsii&#x27;s&quot; genome. It is theorized that while &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; once possessed complete, complex metabolic pathways that allowed it to survive outside a host, evolutionary pressures caused progressive genomic reduction that now limits metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Energy is primarily obtained through a combination of oxidative phosphorylation of imported host carbon sources and direct harvesting of ATP via a ATP/ADP transmembrane pump. Remnants of these lost metabolic pathways can be seen in analysis of &quot;R. rickettsii&#x27;s&quot; genome, which contain some identified remnant enzymes of pathways that remain unfunctional &quot;in vivo&quot;. This decrease in available metabolic pathways has left &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; largely dependent on a range of transport systems to harvest essential amino acids, nucleic acids, and other metabolites from its host. 

The primary carbon source of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is pyruvate, though many other amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates such as glutamine, glutamate,and malate can be used. For lipid metabolism, a complete map of fatty acid synthesis enzymes have been found, allowing &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to construct a viable cell membrane made up of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Regarding synthesis of a peptidoglycan layer, there is speculation as to whether key components are synthesized internally or imported and modified for use. Pathways for producing critical small molecules such as riboflavin (B2), nicotinamide (B3), pantothenate (B5), pyridoxine (B6), and biotin (B7) are all missing key enzymes, forcing &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to rely solely on transmembrane transport proteins.

Overall, &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has a genome that does not encode many of the enzymes and proteins that are required for several pathways besides the TCA cycle. These bacteria import many of the intermediates, cofactors, and byproducts from the host cells&#x27; metabolic pathways to use for their own synthesis of necessary structures and energy for survival.

=== Morphology ===
&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has many vital proteins within its cellular membranes. One of these proteins is YbgF, which maintains the structure of the cellular membrane. YbgF is found within both the inner and outer membranes along with another protein called TolC. TolC is a transport protein that connects to other transport proteins within the periplasmic space and inner membrane. These two proteins are believed to be associated with pathogenicity of this microbe and serve as specific points that antibodies can bind to in order to prevent the bacteria from interacting with host cells.

&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has an outer layer or a &quot;microcapsule&quot;, in addition to the traditional peptidoglycan cell wall. The function of the microcapsule resembles that of slime layers, or S-layers, of other bacteria. This slime layer consists mostly of polysaccharides and is constantly undergoing changes in reaction to chemical or physiological events. Research to precisely determine the function of the slime layer is currently limited due to high risk of infection while working with this bacterium; however, scientists can infer based on conclusions from other studies that it is likely that this slime layer is used for antiphagocytic properties. This prevents phagocytes from engulfing and killing the &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; bacteria and allows for attachment to host cells in preparation to penetrate and infect those cells.

=== Pathophysiology ===

While humans are hosts for &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;, they do not contribute to rickettsial transmission. Rather, the pathogen is maintained through its vector: ticks. &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; invades vascular endothelial cells that line both small and medium sized the blood vessels in the host&#x27;s body. There is an extensive immune response to this pathogen that triggers different pathways in the macrovascular and microvascular systems. As the cells are damaged there is an increased permeability of the vessels (extravasation), microvascular hemorrhages, and necrosis. Additionally, there is evidence that suggests the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and into the hosts central nervous system, allowing the pathogen to target the brain&#x27;s vasculature.The pathogen causes changes in the host cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton that induces phagocytosis. Consequently, &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; replicates further and infects other cells in the host&#x27;s body. &quot;R. rickettsii&#x27;s&quot; survival in the immune system cells increases the pathogen&#x27;s virulence in mammalian hosts.

Nitric oxide has the ability to inhibit the pathogen by negatively effecting attachment, intracellular growth, and subversion of the host cell. It does so by depleting &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; of ATP as nitric oxide targets cytochrome bo oxidase and cytochrome bd oxidase complexes which are necessary for ATP-synthase. The impact of nitric oxide on the metabolism however is significant enough to limit the pathogens ability to attach to host cells. As translation is also majorly ATP-dependent, the introduction of nitric oxide can greatly reduce the process of translation and therefore protein synthesis, making &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; incapable of subverting the host cell. Understanding of these inhibitory processes may allow for more advance care and possible antimicrobial treatments to be developed.

Actin-Based Motility (ABM) is a virulence factor that allows for the pathogen to evade the host&#x27;s immune cells and spread to neighboring cells. It is suggested that the Sca2 gene, which is an actin-polymerizing determinant, is a distinguishing factor for the &quot;Rickettsia&quot; family, as &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; mutants with a Sca2 transposon the bacteria can avoid autophagic processes by host phagocytic cells. This leads to an increase in disease manifestation for the host.

&quot;R.&quot; &quot;rickettsii&quot; is also able to suppress immune responses while dwelling in infected cells by creating inhibitory proteins such as Rickettsial ankyrin repeat protein 2 (RARP2). RARP2 mediates the fragmentation of TGN, or the trans-Golgi network, causing attenuation of vesicular transport and glycosylation defects in infected host cells. There are two important proteins within the host cell that are affected by these glycosylation defects: TGN46 and major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-I). MHC-I is an important protein for defending against pathogens as it functions as an antigen presenting complex signaling its infection status to lyphocytes. However, since RARP2 causes attenuation of vesicular transport, MHC-I is unable to be transported to the plasma membrane and the infected cell will not be able to alert host immune cells. Thus, the bacterial cells are able to avoid certain immune responses and allow for proliferation within a host cell.

This pathogen also has the unique ability, as seen in studies on ticks, to prevent apoptosis. It does so by affecting apoptosis regulators such as caspases, Bcl-2 proteins, or possibly the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. This provides an advantage, allowing &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; to proliferate further due to prolonged survival and increased time for replication. By doing so, &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; also increases its transmission abilities. Without this process in place, the pathogen may not survive long enough in the vector to properly replicate and infect other hosts.

&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is an obligate intracellular alpha proteobacterium that belongs to the &quot;Rickettsiacaea&quot; family. Within the Rickettsia species, these bacteria are divided into four clades. The clades include the ancestral group, spotted fever group (SFG), typhus group, and transitional group, and the determining factors for classifying into each group depends on phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic organization, or the type of vector host they inhabit. &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; falls into the largest group of them all, the SFG group. &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has a genome that consists of about 1.27 Mbp with ~1,350 predicted genes, which is smaller compared to most other bacteria. This small genome size allows the bacteria to maintain an intracellular lifestyle with increased pathogenicity from gene reduction. It is maintained in its tick host by transovarial transmission. The multiplication of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is by binary fission inside the cytosol.

The multiplication of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is by binary fission inside the cytosol.

=== Genomic comparison of strains ===
&quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has a relatively small genome; however, variances in gene expression between different strains can lead to various functions of the bacteria. For instance, there are two major strains of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; called the Iowa and the Sheila Smith strains. The Sheila Smith strain is a virulent strain, while the Iowa strain is an avirulent strain. Microarrays revealed that there were only four distinct differences in the gene expression of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;; however, these four changes lead to complete differences in virulence, and thus the niche of the bacteria. A key feature allowing for differentiation is the rickettsial outer membrane protein, rOmpA and rOmpB which contributes to the identification of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; strains as virulent. The detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are used to differentiate these strains.

==Transmission cycle==

=== Ecology ===
The most common hosts for &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; are ticks. Ticks that carry &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; fall into the family of &quot;Ixodidae&quot; ticks, also known as &quot;hard-bodied&quot; ticks. Ticks are vectors, reservoirs, and amplifiers of these bacteria.

There are currently three known tick species that commonly carry &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;. The American dog tick (&quot;Dermacentor variabilis&quot;), mainly found in the eastern United States, is the most common vector for &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;. The Rocky Mountain wood tick (&quot;Dermacentor andersoni&quot;), found in the Rocky Mountain States, and the brown dog tick (&quot;Rhipicephalus sanguineus)&quot;, found in select areas of the southern United States, are also known vectors of the pathogen. Infecting horses and capybaras, the cayenne tick (&quot;Amblyomma cajennense&quot;) turns vertebrate hosts into amplifier hosts of the bacteria. Other small rodent species serve as amplifier hosts in the United States and South America.

=== Transmission in ticks ===
Ticks can contract &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; by many means. An uninfected tick can become infected through feeding on the blood of an infected vertebrate host during the larval or nymph stages. This mode of transmission is called &quot;transstadial transmission&quot;. Once a tick becomes infected with this pathogen, they are infected for life. The pathogen, however, does not harm the tick itself and only causes symptoms in mammals infected by the tick. Both the American Dog Tick and the Rocky Mountain Wood Tick serve as long-term reservoirs for &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot;, infecting the posterior diverticula of the midgut, the small intestine, and the ovaries. In addition, an infected male tick can transmit the organism to an uninfected female during mating, and infected female ticks can transmit the infection to their offspring in a process known as &quot;transovarian passage&quot;. This process, however, is unlikely to play a major role in the maintenance of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; within a population. Notably, &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; is inefficient at infecting the ovaries of adult female ticks, resulting in a lowered rate of vertical transmission. Rickettsial colonization of the ovaries sees higher success when ticks obtain the pathogen as a larva or nymph. Reduced fecundity is also observed in ticks infected with &quot;R. rickettsii&quot;. As a result of these limitations, long-term maintenance of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in populations of ticks relies mainly on horizontal transmission through the exchange of bacteria during feedings of infected hosts.

The duration of tick attachment, bacterial loads in tick saliva, and the transmission efficiency of &quot;Rickettsia&quot; are important factors underlying transmission from ticks to humans.

===Transmission in mammals===
Due to its confinement in the midgut and small intestine, &quot;Rickettsia rickettsii&quot; can be transmitted to mammals, including humans.

Transmission can occur in multiple ways. The most common way of contraction is by the bite of an infected tick. After getting bitten by an infected tick, &quot;R. rickettsiae&quot; is transmitted into the bloodstream by tick salivary secretions. The saliva of ticks contain immunomodulatory agents which effect immune defenses in the host. This allows for &quot;R.&quot; &quot;rickettsiae&quot; to be transmitted with little to no resistance from the host&#x27;s immune system.&quot;&quot;Another way to contract the infection is through contact with an infected host&#x27;s feces. If an infected host&#x27;s feces come into contact with an open skin barrier, it is possible for the disease to be transmitted. An uninfected host can become infected when eating food that contains the feces of the infected vector.

Having multiple modes of transmission ensures the persistence of &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in a population. Additionally, having multiple modes of transmission helps the disease adapt better to new environments and prevents it from becoming eradicated. &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; has evolved a number of strategic mechanisms, or virulence factors, that allow it to invade the host immune system and successfully infect its host.

== Clinical manifestations ==

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) must be made based on the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient and then later be confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is often misdiagnosed due to its non-specific onset. The majority of infections from &quot;R.&quot; &quot;rickettsii&quot; occur during the warmer months between April and September due to its most common method of transmission being via tick bite. Symptoms can take 1–2 days to 2 weeks to present themselves within the host. The diagnosis of RMSF is easier when there is a known history of a tick bite or if the rash is already apparent in the affected individual. If not treated properly, the illness may become serious, leading to hospitalization and possible fatality.

===Signs and symptoms===
During the initial stages of the disease, the infected person may experience headaches, muscle aches, chills, and high fever. Other early symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and conjunctival injection (red eyes). Most people infected by &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; develop a spotted rash, that begins to appear 2 to 4 days after the individual develops a fever. If left untreated, more severe symptoms may develop; these symptoms may include insomnia, compromised mental ability, coma, and damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, or additional organs.
The classic Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever rash occurs in about 90% of patients and develops 2 to 5 days after the onset of fever. The rash can differ greatly in appearance along the progress of the &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; infection. It is not itchy and starts out as flat pink macules located on the affected individual&#x27;s hands, feet, arms, and legs. During the course of the disease, the rash may form petechiae and take on a more darkened reddish purple spotted appearance, signifying severe disease.

In rarer cases, patients may present with chest pain due to myocarditis. Additionally, rare symptoms include vision impairment and arthritis that may exist as chronic sequelae, lasting anywhere from 10 days to 4 years. Other chronic sequelae include some cases of neurological challenges, such as impaired speech, dysphagia, ataxia, memory loss, cortical blindness, and decreased attention span. Necrosis of skin is another rare case of sequelae.

===Severe infections===
Patients with severe infections may require hospitalization. The more severe symptoms occur later in response to thrombosis (blood clotting) caused by &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; targeting endothelial cells in vascular tissue. One manifestation of this damage is the development of a petechial rash, which in 60% of cases presents within 6 days of initial symptoms. Petechial rashes are indicative of more severe disease progression. Patients may become hyponatremic, experience elevated liver enzymes, and other more pronounced symptoms. It is not uncommon for severe cases to involve respiratory system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, or renal system complications. In the case of meningoencephalitis, &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; causes cellular damage to brain tissue, resulting in inflammation. Additionally, acute respiratory distress syndrome and coagulopathy occur in cases that advance to severe stages of RMSF. This disease is worst for elderly patients, males, African Americans, alcoholics, and patients with G6PD deficiency. The mortality rate for RMSF is 3 to 5 percent in treated cases, but 13 to 25 in untreated cases. Deaths are usually caused by heart and kidney failure.

=== Treatment ===
RMSF symptoms can vary from moderate to severe cases, and a delay in treatment is often associated with a higher case-fatality rate. The most common and effective treatment for Rocky mountain spotted fever is the anti-microbial agent doxycycline. This antibiotic acts as a bacteriostatic drug by inhibiting protein synthesis via blockage of the 30S ribosomal subunit.

Other treatments with chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides have been explored. However, treatment with only chloramphenicol compared to other treatments (tetracycline-class drugs only, both chloramphenicol and tetracycline-class drugs, and neither drug) was associated with a case-fatality rate three times higher. Chloramphenicol, like doxycycline, also functions as a bacteriostatic drug, but it binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit in order to prevent protein synthesis. Macrolides target the 50S subunit as well; however, they block the exit site for peptides, while chloramphenicol blocks the aminoacyl-tRNA attachment site for transfer RNA.

=== Prevention ===

Prevention of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever begins with identifying and avoiding vectors that cause exposure including ticks, lice, mites, and fleas. Knowledge of where endemic areas are and taking precautions when inhabiting or traveling may also decrease the likelihood of contracting the disease. There are no vaccines to prevent RMSF. Due to increased antibiotic resistance preemptive antibiotic prophylaxis is strongly discouraged in the United States.

When coming into contact with vectors, specifically ticks, there are additional preventative measures that can be taken. Many ticks are present in dense bush, grass, and wooded areas. Ticks also can travel on animals, so caution should be taken with pets. They are under the arms, within and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, within and around the hair, in between the legs, and around the waist. Clothing can be placed it in the dryer on high for at least 10 minutes. Clothes can washed before drying with hot water. Showering two hours after leaving the outside environment lowers the risk of obtaining Lyme disease, a disease whose vector is ticks, therefore it may assist in reducing the risk of other tick-borne diseases.

An alternative or additive measure is the use of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents while in areas prone to ticks. These repellents contain at least one of the following active ingredients; picaridin, IR3535, DEET, Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-doil (PMD), or 2-undecanone. Use of repellent that contains OLE or PMD in infants and toddlers, or until they reach 3 years of age is contraindicated.

== History ==

The first documented case of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) presented in the Boise, Idaho in 1896 after being recognized by Major Marshall H. Wood. At the time of discovery, not much information was known about the disease. It was originally called &quot;Black Measles&quot; due to the infected area turning black during the late stages of the disease. The first clinical description of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever was reported in Snake River Valley in 1899 by Edward E. Maxey. At the time, 69% of individuals diagnosed with RMSF died. It was theorized that the wood tick played a critical role as a vector of disease, based on apparent correlation between tick exposure and disease, as well as the geographic and seasonal presentation. 

Howard Ricketts (1871–1910), an associate professor of pathology at the University of Chicago in 1902, was the first to identify and study &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; on a microbial level. His research consisted of interviewing victims of the disease, as well as collecting infected animals to study. He was also known to inject himself with pathogens to more accurately document their effects. Ricketts was the first to identify the pathogen responsible for RMSF as a gram negative bacillus, and confirm a route of transmission from infected ticks in a guinea pig model. His research provided valuable information on the organism&#x27;s vector and route of transmission.

Simeon Burt Wolbach is credited for the first detailed, published description of the pathogenic agent that causes &quot;R. rickettsii&quot; in 1919. Wolbach described RMSF using the process of Giemsa staining, and positively identified the bacterium as frequently residing within endothelial cells.

The once lethal infection RMSF has become curable due to the modern availability of antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline-class drugs, like doxycycline, were first harnessed as treatment for RMSF in the late 1940s. Before their discovery, 1 in 5 infected patients died. Treatment recommendations changed in the 1990s to support primary therapeutic use of tetracycline-class drugs, and the current recommended treatment reflects this, as doxycycline is most commonly prescribed. This change in treatment recommendation coincided with a decrease in annual case-fatality rates (CFRs) from the 1980s on to the early 1990s. Since then, the fatality rate has dropped to between 5 and 10%.

<text>The Newark Bay Bridge, officially the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge, is a steel through arch bridge that is continuous across three spans. It crosses Newark Bay and connects the cities of Newark (in Essex County) and Bayonne (in Hudson County) in New Jersey, United States. It was completed April 4, 1956, as part of the New Jersey Turnpike&#x27;s Newark Bay (Hudson County) Extension, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by Governor of New Jersey Robert B. Meyner.

The main span is , with a clearance over water to allow marine access to Port Newark. The bridge is similar in design to the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, and was similar in length to the Francis Scott Key Bridge at Baltimore&#x27;s Outer Harbor. It runs parallel to the earlier built Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway&#x27;s Upper Bay Bridge.

This bridge is also known as &quot;The Turnpike Bridge&quot; and &quot;The Turnpike Extension Bridge&quot;. It carries traffic on a toll regulated section of Interstate 78 along the New Jersey Turnpike to interchanges 14 through 14A. It provides access from the New Jersey Turnpike&#x27;s main roadway to Hudson County, New Jersey and the Holland Tunnel. The turnpike route creates the border between Bayonne and Jersey City and then runs northward along Port Jersey, Liberty State Park, and Downtown Jersey City. Hoboken is just north of the entrance to Holland Tunnel which continues to Lower Manhattan in New York City.

From March 2014 until May 2019, during certain hours, the eastbound shoulder of the Turnpike Extension (including the bridge) was opened for normal traffic (by green arrows above, instead of red Xs), for a total of 5 lanes (3 eastbound, 2 westbound). This system was discontinued on May 20, 2019.

There is a long-term capital improvements project to build a new bridge.

<doc id="993381" wikidata="Q490334" url="?curid=993381" title="NGC 185">
<text>NGC 185 (also known as Caldwell 18) is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy located 2.08 million light-years from Earth, appearing in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is a member of the Local Group, and is a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). NGC 185 was discovered by William Herschel on November 30, 1787, and he cataloged it &quot;H II.707&quot;. John Herschel observed the object again in 1833 when he cataloged it as &quot;h 35&quot;, and then in 1864 when he cataloged it as &quot;GC 90&quot; within his &quot;General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters&quot;. NGC 185 was first photographed between 1898 and 1900 by James Edward Keeler with the Crossley Reflector of Lick Observatory. Unlike most dwarf elliptical galaxies, NGC 185 contains young stellar clusters, and star formation proceeded at a low rate until the recent past. NGC 185 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is usually classified as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy, though its status as a Seyfert is questioned. It is possibly the closest Seyfert galaxy to Earth, and is the only known Seyfert in the Local Group.

==Distance measurements==
At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to NGC 185. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to galaxies based on the graininess of their appearance. The distance measured to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.08 ± 0.15 Mly (640 ± 50 kpc). However, NGC 185 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.02 ± 0.2 Mly (620 ± 60 kpc).

==Star formation==
Martínez-Delgado, Aparicio, &amp; Gallart (1999) looked into the star formation history of NGC 185 and found that the majority of star formation in NGC 185 happened at early times. In the last ~1 Gyr, stars have formed only near the center of this galaxy. Walter Baade discovered young blue objects within this galaxy in 1951, but these have turned out to be star clusters and not individual stars. A supernova remnant near the center was also discovered by Martínez-Delgado et al.

<text>Candy Dulfer (born 19 September 1969) is a Dutch jazz and pop saxophonist. She is the daughter of jazz saxophonist Hans Dulfer. She began playing at age six and founded her band Funky Stuff when she was fourteen. Her debut album &quot;Saxuality&quot; (1990) received a Grammy nomination. She has performed and recorded with her dad Hans, Prince, Dave Stewart, Van Morrison, Angie Stone, Maceo Parker and Rick Braun and has performed live with Alan Parsons (1995), Pink Floyd (1990), and Tower of Power (2014). She hosted the Dutch television series &quot;Candy Meets...&quot; (2007), in which she interviewed musicians. In 2013, she became a judge in the 5th season of the Dutch version of &quot;X Factor&quot;.

==Early life==

Dulfer was born on 19 September 1969 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. She began playing the drums at the age of five. As a six-year-old, she started to play the soprano saxophone. At age seven, she switched to alto saxophone and later began playing in a local concert band Jeugd Doet Leven (English translation: &quot;Youth Brings Life&quot;) in Zuiderwoude.

Dulfer played her first solo on stage with her father&#x27;s band De Perikels (&quot;The Perils&quot;). At age eleven, she made her first recordings for the album &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Ask&quot; (1981) of De Perikels. In 1982, when she was twelve years old, she played as a member of Rosa King&#x27;s Ladies Horn section at the North Sea Jazz Festival. According to Dulfer, King encouraged her to become a band leader. In 1984, at age fourteen, she started the band Funky Stuff.

==Career==
Dulfer&#x27;s band performed throughout the Netherlands and in 1987 was the opening act for two of Madonna&#x27;s European concerts.

In 1988, Prince invited Dulfer on stage to play an improvised solo during one of his European shows. In 1989 Dulfer appeared in Prince&#x27;s &quot;Partyman&quot; video.

Dulfer performed session work with Eurythmics guitarist and producer Dave Stewart, duetting with him on the worldwide hit single &quot;Lily Was Here&quot; and contributing to the soundtrack of the same name. She was a guest musician for Pink Floyd during the band&#x27;s performance at Knebworth in 1990, from which several tracks were released on a multi-artist live album and video, &quot;Live at Knebworth &#x27;90&quot;. The Knebworth show has since been released as part of the Pink Floyd box set &quot;The Later Years 1987–2019&quot; on CD, DVD, and BD.

Dulfer was also the featured saxophonist on Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;A Night in San Francisco&quot;, an album in 1993, and performed with Alan Parsons and his band at the World Liberty Concert in 1995.

Dulfer collaborated with her father Hans Dulfer on the duet album &quot;Dulfer Dulfer&quot; in 2001. She joined Prince&#x27;s band in 2004 for his Musicology Live 2004ever tour.

In 2007, she released her ninth studio album &quot;Candy Store&quot;. The album reached a No. 2 position in Billboard&#x27;s Top Contemporary Jazz charts. Her songs &quot;Candy Store&quot; and &quot;L.A. Citylights&quot; reached the No. 1 position in Smooth Jazz National Airplay charts in the United States.

Dulfer is mostly a self-taught musician except for some training in a concert band and a few months of music lessons.
Until 2010 Dulfer played a Selmer Mk VI alto - which is visible in the majority of early photographs. In 2010 she became an endorsee of the Dutch Free Wind saxophone, created by Friso Heidinga, who started building saxophones in Amsterdam in 2009.

In 2007, Dulfer became the presenter and interviewer in &quot;Candy Meets...&quot;, her television program for the Dutch public broadcaster NPS. In the series, she met with Sheila E., Maceo Parker, Hans Dulfer, Van Morrison, Dave Stewart, and Mavis Staples.

On 13 August 2017, she was granted the honorary citizenship of the Serbian city of Niš, for continuously promoting the city through appearances in the national media in the Netherlands and throughout the world during her tour and festival performances on all continents since her first performance at since at Nisville Jazz Festival in 2009.

On 26 August 2022, Dulfer announced her new album &quot;We Never Stop&quot;, which released on 28 October. The release is the first as a part of her new record deal with Mascot Label Group. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Jammin&#x27; Tonight,&quot; featuring Nile Rodgers.

<text>Juan Carlos Onetti Borges (July 1, 1909 – May 30, 1994) was a Uruguayan novelist and author of short stories.

==Early life==
Onetti was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was the son of Carlos Onetti, a customs official, and Honoria Borges, who belonged to a Brazilian aristocratic family from the state of Rio Grande do Sul. He had two siblings: an older brother Raul, and a younger sister Rachel. 

The original surname of his family was O&#x27;Nety (of Irish or Scottish origin). The writer himself commented: &quot;the first to come here, my great-great-grandfather, was English, born in Gibraltar. My grandfather was the one who italianized the name&quot;.

==Career==
A high school drop-out, Onetti&#x27;s first novel, &quot;El pozo&quot;, published in 1939, met with his close friends&#x27; immediate acclaim, as well as from some writers and journalists of his time. 500 copies of the book were printed, most of them left to rot at the only bookstore that sold it, Barreiro (the book was not reprinted until the 1960s, with an introduction and preliminary study by Ángel Rama). Aged 30, Onetti was already working as editing secretary of the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper &quot;Marcha&quot;. He had lived for some years in Buenos Aires, where he published short stories and wrote cinema critiques for the local media, and met and befriended novelist and journalist Roberto Arlt, author of the novels &quot;El juguete rabioso&quot;, &quot;Los siete locos&quot;, &quot;Los lanzallamas&quot;.

He went on to become one of Latin America&#x27;s most distinguished writers, earning Uruguay National Literature Prize in 1962. He was considered a senior member of the &#x27;Generation of 45&#x27;, a Uruguayan intellectual and literary movement: Carlos Maggi, Manuel Flores Mora, Ángel Rama, Emir Rodríguez Monegal, Idea Vilariño, Carlos Real de Azúa, Mauricio Muller, José Pedro Díaz, Amanda Berenguer, Mario Benedetti, Ida Vitale, Líber Falco, among others.

In 1974, he and some of his colleagues were imprisoned by the military dictatorship. Their crime: as members of the jury, they had chosen Nelson Marra&#x27;s short story &quot;El guardaespaldas&quot; (i.e. &quot;The bodyguard&quot;) as the winner of &quot;Marcha&quot;&#x27;s annual literary contest. Due to a series of misunderstandings (and the need to fill some space in the following day&#x27;s edition), &quot;El guardaespaldas&quot; was published in &quot;Marcha&quot;, although it had been widely agreed among them that they shouldn&#x27;t do so due to its sensitive political themes. 
Onetti left his native country (and his much-loved city of Montevideo) after being imprisoned for 6 months in &quot;Colonia Etchepare&quot;, a mental institution. A long list of world-famous writers -including Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Mario Benedetti – signed open letters addressed to the military government of Uruguay.

As soon as he was released, Onetti fled to Spain with his wife, violinist Dorothea Muhr. There he continued his career as a writer, being awarded the most prestigious literary prize in the Spanish-speaking world, the Premio Cervantes. He remained in Madrid until his death there in 1994. He is interred in the Cementerio de la Almudena in Madrid.

There is an Argentinian film based on his short story &quot;El infierno tan temido.&quot;

<text>Christopher Stephen Botti ( ; born October 12, 1962) is an American trumpeter and composer.

In 2013, Botti won the Grammy Award in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category, for the album &quot;Impressions&quot;. 
He was also nominated in 2008 for his album &quot;Italia&quot; and received three nominations in 2010 for the live album &quot;Chris Botti in Boston&quot;. Four of his albums have reached the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz albums chart.

Coming to prominence with the 2001 recording of his &quot;Night Sessions&quot; album, Botti established a reputation as a versatile musician in both jazz and pop music for his ability to fuse both styles together.

==Early life==

Botti was born in Portland, Oregon, and raised in Corvallis, although he also spent two years of his childhood in Italy. His earliest musical influence was his mother, a classically trained pianist and part-time piano teacher. He started playing the trumpet at nine years old, and committed to the instrument at age 12 when he heard Miles Davis play &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;.

In 1981, he was selected as a member of McDonald&#x27;s All American High School Jazz Band, which marked his first Carnegie Hall performance. 

At the age of 17, he ended up at Mount Hood Community College in Gresham, Oregon, by convincing his high school to allow him to fulfill his remaining senior year credits there. Chris set his class schedule so that he could also play at Portland clubs in the evening. Mount Hood&#x27;s program was headed by Larry McVey, whose band had come to be a proving ground and regular stop for Stan Kenton and Mel Tormé when they were looking for new players. It was here Botti played alongside his friend, trombonist and future Academy Award nominated filmmaker, Todd Field.

After graduating from Crescent Valley High School, Botti studied under jazz educator David Baker and trumpet professor Bill Adam at the Indiana University School of Music. 

Botti was also the recipient of two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts which allowed him to study with trumpeter Woody Shaw and saxophonist George Coleman during two consecutive summer breaks.

==Career==

===Early career===
Botti left Indiana University during his senior year for short touring stints with Frank Sinatra and Buddy Rich. In 1985, he moved to New York City to hone his craft as a studio musician.

In 1990, he began a decade long touring and recording relationship with Paul Simon which broadened his exposure to other singers. During that period, he also performed/recorded with Aretha Franklin, Natalie Cole, Bette Midler, Joni Mitchell, Natalie Merchant, Scritti Politti, Roger Daltrey and others.

On August 15, 1991, Botti performed with Paul Simon in New York&#x27;s Central Park as part of The &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot; tour. The performance was commercially released as the &quot;Concert in the Park&quot; CD. While on tour with Simon, he met saxophonist Michael Brecker, which led to Botti co-producing a track on the Brecker Brothers&#x27; &quot;Out of the Loop&quot; titled &quot;Evocations&quot;.

===Verve recordings (1995–2000)===
Botti&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;First Wish&quot;, was released in 1995; his second effort, &quot;Midnight Without You&quot;, which included a collaboration with Blue Nile vocalist Paul Buchanan, appeared in 1997. These were followed by &quot;Slowing Down the World&quot; in 1999, which included vocal contributions from Sting and Jonatha Brooke (also on the &quot;Midnight Without You&quot; release).

Botti composed the score and recorded a soundtrack for the 1996 film &quot;Caught&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Botti was a member of Bruford Levin Upper Extremities, a group exploring a more experimental, jazz fusion-oriented sound than his solo records. 

Starting in 1999, Botti toured with Sting as a featured soloist in the &quot;Brand New Day&quot; tour. The two-year run culminated in &quot;All This Time&quot;, a CD/DVD-taping and webcast performance from Sting&#x27;s estate in Tuscany on September 11, 2001. Botti says his close friendship with Sting was an important development in his career.

===Columbia recordings (2001–2022)===
Botti was introduced to Columbia by Bobby Colomby, drummer and founding member of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, who went on to become his producer and manager. Botti&#x27;s first Columbia release was &quot;Night Sessions&quot; in 2001. This was followed in 2002 by &quot;December&quot;, a holiday album, which included an original composition by Richard Marx. The project represented the only time Botti has performed vocals on two tracks.

A &quot;Thousand Kisses Deep&quot;, was released in 2003 and contained a group of originals and covers that accent Botti&#x27;s crossover appeal as both a jazz and pop musician. &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; followed in 2004, which featured a more traditional sound than its predecessor.

&quot;To Love Again: The Duets&quot;, released in 2005, continued where the previous album left off with more lush orchestral jazz via the London Session Orchestra, this time showcasing guest vocalists — as well as a handful of instrumental tracks.

In May 2005, Botti was invited to perform at Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Legends Ball weekend honoring her African American heroines. In 2006, Billy Childs, Gil Goldstein &amp; Heitor Pereira won the Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s): &quot;What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?&quot; (Chris Botti &amp; Sting) from Botti&#x27;s album &quot;To Love Again – The Duets&quot;. 2006 also marked his first PBS collaboration, &quot;Chris Botti Live: With Orchestra and Special Guests&quot;, released in early 2006. The CD and platinum-certified DVD included duets with Sting, Burt Bacharach, Gladys Knight, Jill Scott and Renee Olstead.

On September 25, 2007, Botti released an album entitled &quot;Italia&quot;. The album places focus on Botti&#x27;s Italian roots through such songs as &quot;Venice&quot;, &quot;Estaté&quot;, and the title track &quot;Italia&quot;, on which he partnered with Andrea Bocelli. In December 2007, the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Botti also performed the song with Bocelli during the 2007 edition of the Teatro del Silenzio, which was released on DVD titled &quot;Vivere Live in Tuscany&quot; in 2008.

Early in 2009, Botti released his second CD/DVD PBS project, &quot;Chris Botti In Boston&quot;. Performing with the Boston Pops Orchestra, Botti shared the stage with Yo-Yo Ma, Steven Tyler, Josh Groban, Katharine McPhee, John Mayer, Sting, and others.

His first few releases are often classified as smooth jazz, though critic Alex Henderson argues that Botti&#x27;s music was a cut above much of the genre; reviewing his 1999 album, &quot;Slowing Down the World&quot;, Henderson writes &quot;it would be a major mistake to lump it in with... outright elevator muzak ... Botti is capable of a lot more.&quot; That same year as well as the following year, Botti appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra.

On April 17, 2012, Botti released his tenth studio album Impressions. On February 10, 2013, the album received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album.

On August 18, 2018, PBS released Botti&#x27;s third PBS project, &quot;Great Performances: The Chris Botti Band in Concert&quot;, where he was joined on stage by vocalists Sy Smith and Veronica Swift, violinist Caroline Campbell and organist Joey DeFrancesco, along with pianist Taylor Eigsti.

===Blue Note Records and &quot;Vol. 1.&quot; (2023–present)===

Botti&#x27;s debut album on Blue Note Records entitled &quot;Vol. 1&quot; is scheduled to be released October 20. The lead single &quot;Old Folks&quot; was released on August 18.

==In media==
Botti played the theme song on trumpet in closing scenes and credits in the 1998 film &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;.

Botti was the leader of the house band on the nationally syndicated daytime talk show &quot;The Caroline Rhea Show&quot; for its only season in 2002–2003. He was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; of 2004.

Botti performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in MetLife Stadium for a crowd of over 80,000 and a worldwide television audience on November 3, 2014, prior to the Indianapolis Colts vs. New York Giants National Football League game.

Botti appeared in the Season 3 &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot; episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Sing For Your Supper&quot; as a dinner guest of Yolanda Hadid and David Foster.

==Instrument==
Botti plays a Martin Committee large-bore Handcraft trumpet made in 1939, and uses a No. 3 silver-plated mouthpiece from Bach made in 1926, having recently retired his 1920 3C Bach mouthpiece. He uses a Leblanc Vacchiano Harmon mute from the 1950s.

Before getting the Martin Handcraft Committee, Chris Botti played on a 1972 Calicchio S1 ML trumpet originally sold in September 1972. Dominick Calicchio&#x27;s wife Irma Calicchio erased the original owner&#x27;s name and information and put in Chris Botti&#x27;s name as the official owner. He later traded the Calicchio S1 for the 1939 Handcraft Martin Committee.

<doc id="993396" wikidata="Q654754" url="?curid=993396" title="Dwarf spheroidal galaxy">
<text>A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to small, low-luminosity galaxies with very little dust and an older stellar population. They are found in the Local Group as companions to the Milky Way and as systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape and generally have lower luminosity.

== Discovery ==
Despite the radii of dSphs being much larger than those of globular clusters, they are much more difficult to find due to their low luminosities and surface brightnesses. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies have a large range of luminosities, and known dwarf spheroidal galaxies span several orders of magnitude of luminosity. Their luminosities are so low that Ursa Minor, Carina, and Draco, the known dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the lowest luminosities, have mass-to-light ratios (M/L) greater than that of the Milky Way. Dwarf spheroidals also have little to no gas with no obvious signs of recent star formation. Within the Local Group, dSphs are primarily found near the Milky Way and M31.

The first dwarf spheroidal galaxies discovered were Sculptor and Fornax in 1938. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has resulted in the discovery of 11 more dSph galaxies as of 2007 By 2015, many more ultra-faint dSphs were discovered, all satellites of the Milky Way. Nine potentially new dSphs were discovered in the Dark Energy Survey in 2015. Each dSph is named after constellations they are discovered in, such as the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, all of which consist of stars generally much older than 1–2 Gyr that formed over the span of many gigayears.

For example, 98% of the stars in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy are older than 2 Gyr, formed over the course of three bursts around 3, 7 and 13 Gyr ago. The stars in Carina have also been found to be metal-poor. This is unlike star clusters because, while star clusters have stars which formed more or less the same time, dwarf spheroidal galaxies experience multiple bursts of star formation.

== Evidence of dark matter ==
Because of the faintness of the lowest-luminosity dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the nature of the stars contained within them, some astronomers suggest that dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular clusters may not be clearly separate and distinct types of objects. Other recent studies, however, have found a distinction in that the total amount of mass inferred from the motions of stars in dwarf spheroidals is many times that which can be accounted for by the mass of the stars themselves. Studies reveal that dwarf spheroidal galaxies have a dynamical mass of around 10 , which is very large despite the low luminosity of dSph galaxies.

Although at fainter luminosities of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, it is not universally agreed upon how to differentiate between a dwarf spheroidal galaxy and a star cluster; however, many astronomers decide this depending on the object&#x27;s dynamics: If it seems to have more dark matter, then it is likely that it is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy rather than an enormous, faint star cluster. In the current predominantly accepted Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model, the presence of dark matter is often cited as a reason to classify dwarf spheroidal galaxies as a different class of object from globular clusters, which show little to no signs of dark matter. Because of the extremely large amounts of dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, they may deserve the title &quot;most dark matter-dominated galaxies.&quot;

Further evidence of the prevalence of dark matter in dSphs includes the case of Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which can be assumed to be in dynamic equilibrium to estimate mass and amount of dark matter, since the gravitational effects of the Milky Way are small. Unlike the Fornax galaxy, there is evidence that the UMa2, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Ursa Major constellation, experiences strong tidal disturbances from the Milky Way.

A topic of research is how much the internal dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies are affected by the gravitational tidal dynamics of the galaxy they are orbiting. In other words, dwarf spheroidal galaxies could be prevented from achieving equilibrium due to the gravitational field of the Milky Way or other galaxy that they orbit. For example, the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy has a velocity dispersion of 7.9±1.3 km/s, which is a velocity dispersion that could not be explained solely by its stellar mass according to the Virial Theorem. Similar to Sextans, previous studies of Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy reveal that its orbital path does not correspond to the mass contained in Hercules. Furthermore, there is evidence that the UMa2, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Ursa Major constellation, experiences strong tidal disturbances from the Milky Way.

<text>Carl Paul Gottfried von Linde (11 June 1842 – 16 November 1934) was a German scientist, engineer, and businessman. He discovered the refrigeration cycle and invented the first industrial-scale air separation and gas liquefaction processes, which led to the first reliable and efficient compressed-ammonia refrigerator in 1876. 

Linde was the founder of the company now known as Linde plc but formerly known (variously) as the Linde division of Union Carbide, Linde, Linde Air Products, Praxair, and others. This company is the world&#x27;s largest producer of industrial gases and ushered in the creation of the global supply chain for industrial gases. 

Linde was a member of scientific and engineering associations, including being on the board of trustees of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He was knighted in 1897 as Ritter von Linde.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Born in , Bavaria as the son of a German-born minister and a Swedish mother, he was expected to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps but took another direction entirely. Von Linde&#x27;s family moved to Munich in 1854, and eight years later he started a course in engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, Switzerland, where his teachers included Rudolf Clausius, Gustav Zeuner and Franz Reuleaux.

In 1864, he was expelled before graduating for participating in a student protest, but Reuleaux found him a position as an apprentice at the Kottern cotton-spinning plant in Kempten. Linde stayed only a short time before moving first to Borsig in Berlin and then to the new Krauss locomotive factory in Munich, where he worked as head of the technical department. Von Linde married Helene Grimm in September 1866; their marriage lasted 53 years and they had six children.

In 1868 Linde learned of a new university opening in Munich (the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot;) and immediately applied for a job as a lecturer; he was accepted—at the age of 26—for the position. He became a full professor of mechanical engineering in 1872, and set up an engineering lab where students such as Rudolf Diesel studied.

===Middle years===

In 1870 and 1871, Linde published articles in the &quot;Bavarian Industry and Trade Journal&quot; describing his research findings in the area of refrigeration. 
Linde&#x27;s first refrigeration plants were commercially successful, and development began to take up increasing amounts of his time. In 1879, he gave up his professorship and founded the &quot;Gesellschaft für Lindes Eismaschinen Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Linde&#x27;s Ice Machine Company&quot;), now &quot;Linde plc&quot;, in Wiesbaden, Germany. After a slow start in a difficult German economy, business picked up quickly in the 1880s. The efficient new refrigeration technology offered big benefits to the breweries, and by 1890 Linde had sold 747 machines. In addition to the breweries, other uses for the new technology were found in slaughterhouses and cold storage facilities all over Europe.

In 1888, Linde moved back to Munich where he took up his professorship once more but was soon back at work developing new refrigeration cycles. In 1892, an order from the Guinness brewery in Dublin for a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant drove Linde&#x27;s research into the area of low-temperature refrigeration, and in 1894 he started work on a process for the liquefaction of air. In 1895, Linde first achieved success, and filed for patent protection of his process (not approved in the US until 1903). In 1901, Linde began work on a technique to obtain pure oxygen and nitrogen based on the fractional distillation of liquefied air. By 1910, coworkers including Carl&#x27;s son Friedrich had developed the &quot;Linde double-column&quot; process, variants of which are still in common use today.

After a decade, Linde withdrew from managerial activities to refocus on research, and in 1895 he succeeded in liquefying air by first compressing it and then letting it expand rapidly, thereby cooling it. He then obtained oxygen and nitrogen from the liquid air by slow warming. In the early days of oxygen production, the biggest use by far for the gas was the oxyacetylene torch, invented in France in 1903, which revolutionized metal cutting and welding in the construction of ships, skyscrapers, and other iron and steel structures.
In 1897, Linde was appointed to the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown and ennobled in accordance with its statutes.

In addition to Linde&#x27;s technical and engineering abilities, he was a successful entrepreneur. He formed many successful partnerships in Germany and internationally, working effectively to exploit the value of his patents and knowledge through licensing arrangements. 

In 1906, Linde negotiated a stake in Brin&#x27;s Oxygen Company, renamed The BOC Group. in exchange for rights to Linde&#x27;s patents in the UK and other countries, and held a board position until 1914. Linde also formed the Linde Air Products Company in the USA in 1907, a company that passed through US Government control to Union Carbide in the 1940s and on to form Praxair. In 2005 &quot;Linde, plc&quot; bought the BOC Group, and in 2019 &quot;Linde plc&quot; merged with Praxair, thus combining all three companies founded by Linde.

===Later years and death===

From around 1910, Linde started transferring responsibility for the company&#x27;s operation to his sons Friedrich and Richard and to his son-in-law Rudolf Wucherer. He continued with supervisory board and advisory duties until his death.

Carl von Linde died in Munich in November 1934 at the age of 92.

==Key inventions==

Linde&#x27;s first refrigeration system used dimethyl ether as the refrigerant and was built by &quot;Maschinenfabrik Augsburg&quot; (now MAN AG) for the Spaten Brewery in 1873. He quickly moved on to develop more reliable ammonia-based cycles. These were early examples of vapor-compression refrigeration machines, and ammonia is still in wide use as a refrigerant in industrial applications.

His apparatus for the liquefaction of air combined the cooling effect achieved by allowing a compressed gas to expand (the Joule–Thomson effect first observed by James Prescott Joule and Lord Kelvin) with a counter-current heat exchange technique that used the cold air produced by expansion to chill ambient air entering the apparatus. Over a period of time this effect gradually cooled the apparatus and air within it to the point of liquefaction.

Linde followed development of air liquefaction equipment with equipment that also separated air into its constituent parts using distillation processes.

Linde&#x27;s inventions and developments spurred development in many areas of cryogenics, physics, chemistry and engineering.

<doc id="993399" wikidata="Q7529324" url="?curid=993399" title="Sir Thopas">
<text>&quot;Sir Thopas&quot; is one of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer, published in 1387. The tale is one of two—together with The Tale of Melibee—told by the fictive Geoffrey Chaucer as he travels with the pilgrims on the journey to Canterbury Cathedral. The tale concerns the adventures of the knight Sir Thopas and his quest to win the elf-queen.

==Frame==
The tale is one of two told by the fictive Chaucer, along with The Tale of Melibee, who figures as one of the pilgrims who are on a journey to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. The pilgrims are involved in a story-telling contest at the behest of the Host (Middle English: &quot;Hooste&quot;), Harry Bailly, the winner of which will receive a free meal at The Tabard Inn on their return.

&quot;Sir Thopas&quot; comes after &quot;The Prioress&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a poem which is exemplary of the &quot;miracle of the Virgin&quot; genre and which tells the story of a child martyr killed by Jews. Seemingly wishing to counter the sombre mood that this tale instills in the pilgrims, the Host hails Chaucer and suggests that he: &quot;Telle us a tale of myrth, and that anon&quot; (line 706). Chaucer admits to having no tales to tell other than a &quot;rym [he] lerned longe agoon&quot; (line 709), and on the acceptance of the Host proceeds to tell the &quot;Tale of Thopas&quot;.

Chaucer&#x27;s portrait of himself is unflattering and humble. He presents himself as a reticent, maladroit figure who can barely summon a tale to mind. In comparison to the other travellers in the group, Chaucer the character is reluctant to speak, but when he does tell a tale, it is a rather frivolous burlesque very different from what went before.

==Synopsis==
The poem begins with an introduction to Sir Thopas, detailing his birthplace of Flanders, describing his physical appearance and abilities in hunting. He desires the elf-queen but is waylaid by the giant Sir Olifaunt (&#x27;Elephant&#x27;). He runs back to his merry men for a feast of sweets and to ready for a battle with his giant foe. The tale is interrupted by the Host, though, for its tail rhyme format, and is never finished. The tale is a parody of romances, with their knights and fairies and absurdities, and Chaucer the author satirises not only the grandiose, Gallic romances, but also the readership of such tales.

The tale is a hodgepodge of many of the popular stories of the time which even apes their simple rhymes, a style Chaucer uses nowhere else. Elements of deliberate anticlimax abound in as much of the poem as Chaucer is allowed to present. The knight&#x27;s name is in fact topaz, one of the more common gemstones; in Chaucer&#x27;s day, &quot;topaz&quot; included any yellowish quartz. The knight hails from Flanders, which earlier had been a favourite haunt of errant knights but in Chaucer&#x27;s time was better known for prosaic merchants. In the only scene of derring-do that Chaucer tells in the two and a half chapters he gets in, Sir Thopas flees the battle, pelted by stones. The poem thus contains many suggestions that it was intended in a mock-heroic sense.

==Analysis==

===Genre and structure===

&quot;Thopas&quot; is the first of what is usually called the surprise group of tales, as each is quite different from the preceding and they are seemingly written to confound expectations. The host, Harry Bailey, does not seem to appreciate this new style of tale and he interrupts Chaucer, telling him that &quot;thy drasty rymyng is nat worth a toord&quot;.

The character Chaucer then tells the laborious and dull debate of the &quot;Tale of Melibeus&quot;. Again, this is in keeping with the character Chaucer: a man of too much learning and too little experience. The tale is full of moral sentiment and philosophy, but it is fairly slow for modern readers.

===Critical history===
The reception of &#x27;&quot;Sir Thopas&quot; is perhaps the most interesting thing about it. When Chaucer began to be treated as a treasure of English letters after his death, his satiric intent was lost. Into the eighteenth century, readers regarded Harry Bailey&#x27;s interruption as a sign of poor breeding, and they treated the tale of Sir Thopas itself as a great work. It was Thomas Warton who first suggested (at least in print) that Chaucer was not serious, that the whole tale is a parody and that the character of Geoffrey Chaucer must not be confused with Geoffrey Chaucer the author.

==Film adaptations==
Pasolini adapted this story for his film &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. He shot the scene at Mt Etna in Sicily. He later removed the scene and it is now considered lost. A recreation of this scene with film stills can be seen however in the documentary &quot;The Secret Humiliation of Chaucer&quot;.

<text>( ; or ; or ) is a word of Japanese origin generally designating the people affected by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States at the end of World War II.

==Definition==
The word is Japanese, originally written in kanji. While the term ( + + ) has been used before in Japanese to designate any victim of bombs, its worldwide democratization led to a definition concerning the survivors of the atomic bombs dropped in Japan by the United States Army Air Forces on 6 and 9 August 1945.

Anti-nuclear movements and associations, among others of &quot;&quot;, spread the term to designate any direct victim of nuclear disaster, including the ones of the nuclear plant in Fukushima. They, therefore, prefer the writing (replacing with the homophonous ) or . This definition tends to be adopted since 2011.

The legal status of is allocated to certain people, mainly by the Japanese government.

==Official recognition==
The Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law defines as people who fall into one or more of the following categories: within a few kilometers of the hypocenters of the bombs; within of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; exposed to radiation from fallout; or not yet born but carried by pregnant women in any of the three previously mentioned categories. The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as &#x27;. , 106,825 were still alive, mostly in Japan, and in 2024 are expected to surpass the number of surviving US World War veterans. The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation. &#x27; are entitled to government support. They receive a certain amount of allowance per month, and the ones certified as suffering from bomb-related diseases receive a special medical allowance.

The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the &#x27; who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, , the memorials record the names of more than 540,000 &#x27;; 344,306 in Hiroshima and 198,785 in Nagasaki.


In 1957, the Japanese Parliament passed a law providing free medical care for &#x27;. During the 1970s, non-Japanese &#x27; who suffered from those atomic attacks began to demand the right to free medical care and the right to stay in Japan for that purpose. In 1978, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that such persons were entitled to free medical care while staying in Japan.

===Korean survivors===
During the war, Korea had been under Japanese imperial rule, and many Koreans were forced to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a labor force. According to recent estimates, about 20,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and about 2,000 died in Nagasaki. It is estimated that one in seven of the Hiroshima victims was of Korean ancestry. For many years, Koreans had a difficult time fighting for recognition as atomic bomb victims and were denied health benefits. However, most issues have been addressed in recent years through lawsuits.

===Japanese-American survivors===

It was a common practice before the war for American Issei, or first-generation immigrants, to send their children on extended trips to Japan to study or visit relatives. More Japanese immigrated to the U.S. from Hiroshima than any other prefecture, and Nagasaki also sent many immigrants to Hawai&#x27;i and the mainland. There was, therefore, a sizable population of American-born Nisei and Kibei living in their parents&#x27; hometowns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombings. The actual number of Japanese Americans affected by the bombings is unknown – although estimates put approximately 11,000 in Hiroshima city alone – but some 3,000 of them are known to have survived and returned to the U.S. after the war.

A second group of counted among Japanese American survivors are those who came to the U.S. in a later wave of Japanese immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. Most in this group were born in Japan and migrated to the U.S. in search of educational and work opportunities that were scarce in post-war Japan. Many were war brides, or Japanese women who had married American men related to the U.S. military&#x27;s occupation of Japan.

As of 2014, there are about 1,000 recorded Japanese American living in the United States. They receive monetary support from the Japanese government and biannual medical checkups with Hiroshima and Nagasaki doctors familiar with the particular concerns of atomic bomb survivors. The U.S. government provides no support to Japanese American .

===Other foreign survivors===
While one British Commonwealth citizen
and seven Dutch POWs (two names known) died in the Nagasaki bombing, at least two POWs reportedly died postwar from cancer thought to have been caused by the atomic bomb.
One American POW, the Navajo Joe Kieyoomia, was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.

===Double survivors===
People who suffered the effects of both bombings are known as in Japan. These people were in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, and within two days managed to reach Nagasaki.

A documentary called &quot;Twice Bombed, Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki&quot; was produced in 2006. The producers found 165 people who were victims of both bombings, and the production was screened at the United Nations.

On 24 March 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi (1916–2010) as a double . Yamaguchi was confirmed to be from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He got back to his home city of Nagasaki on 8 August, a day before the bomb in Nagasaki was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. Yamaguchi died at the age of 93 on 4 January 2010 of stomach cancer.

==Discrimination==
 and their children were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination when it comes to prospects of marriage or work due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.
The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who could conceive, and were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities or birth defects than the rate observed in the Japanese population.

Studs Terkel&#x27;s book &quot;The Good War&quot; includes a conversation with two . The postscript observes:

The is a group formed by in 1956 with the goals of pressuring the Japanese government to improve support of the victims and lobbying governments for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

Some estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, but how many died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20–30 days.

In the rare cases of survival for individuals who were in utero at the time of the bombing and yet who still were close enough to be exposed to less than or equal to 0.57 Gy, no difference in their cognitive abilities was found, suggesting a threshold dose for pregnancies below which there is no danger. In 50 or so children who survived the gestational process and were exposed to more than this dose, putting them within about 1000 meters from the hypocenter, microcephaly was observed; this is the only elevated birth defect issue observed in the , occurring in approximately 50 in-utero individuals who were situated less than 1000 meters from the bombings.

In a manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 &quot;Life Span Study&quot;, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 who had still been living between 1958–1987 and who took part in the study.

An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers, of unspecified lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being estimated at 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality.

<text>In computer jargon, blinkenlights are diagnostic lights on front panels of old mainframe computers. More recently the term applies to status lights of modern network hardware (modems, network hubs, etc.). Blinkenlights disappeared from more recent computers for a number of reasons, the most important being the fact that with faster CPUs a human can no longer interpret the processes in the computer on the fly. Though more sophisticated UI mechanisms have since been developed, blinkenlights may still be present as additional status indicators and familiar skeuomorphs.

== Etymology ==
The term has its origins in hacker humor and is taken from a famous (often blackletter-Gothic) mock warning sign written in a mangled form of German. Variants of the sign were relatively common in computer rooms in English-speaking countries from the early 1960s. One version read:

Some versions of the sign end with the word &quot;blinkenlights&quot;.

The sign dates back as far as 1955 at IBM, and a copy was reported at London University&#x27;s Atlas computer facility.

Although the sign might initially appear to be in German and uses an approximation of German grammar, it is composed largely of words that are either near-homonyms of English words or (in the cases of the longer words) actual English words that are rendered in a faux-German spelling. As such, the sign is generally comprehensible by many English speakers regardless of whether they have any fluency in German, but mostly incomprehensible to German speakers with no knowledge of English. Much of the humor in these signs was their intentionally incorrect language.

Michael J. Preston relates the sign as being posted above photocopiers in offices as a warning not to mess with the machine in the first print reference from 1974. The sign is also reported to have been seen on an electron microscope at the Cavendish Laboratory in the 1950s. Such pseudo-German parodies were common in Allied machine shops during and following World War II, and an example photocopy is shown in the &quot;Jargon File&quot;.

The &quot;Jargon File&quot; also mentions that German hackers had in turn developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster, in broken English:

== Actual blinkenlights ==

The Connection Machine, a -processor parallel computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving Conway&#x27;s Game of Life patterns.

The two CPU load monitors on the front of BeBoxes were also called &quot;blinkenlights&quot;.

This word gave its name to several projects, including screen savers, hardware gadgets, and other nostalgic endeavours. Notable such enterprises include, but are not limited to, the German Chaos Computer Club&#x27;s Project Blinkenlights and the Blinkenlights Archaeological Institute.

<doc id="993411" wikidata="Q726018" url="?curid=993411" title="Boney James">
<text>Boney James (born James Oppenheim September 1, 1961) is an American saxophonist, recording artist, songwriter and record producer.

He is a four-time Grammy Award nominee (Best Pop Instrumental Album, 2001, 2004, 2014 and Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance, 2009) and a Soul Train Award winner (Best Jazz Album 1998). He has also received three NAACP Image Award nominations for Best Jazz Album. James has sold over four million albums, and has accumulated four RIAA Certified Gold Records. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named James one of the Top 3 &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Artists of the Decade. In 2024 James became the first artist to notch twenty #1 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine SJ Chart.

== Biography ==
James took up the clarinet at the age of eight, switching to sax when he was ten having spent his early teen years in New Rochelle, New York. He became musically influenced by the R&amp;B Motown genre and saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr. When he was fourteen his family moved to Los Angeles, where he joined a fusion band that opened for acts like Flora Purim and the Yellowjackets. Another member of this early band was John Shanks, now a successful pop producer. James eventually received a degree in history from UCLA, but began playing music full-time after graduation. James learned to play keyboards and in 1985 he joined Morris Day&#x27;s band. His R&amp;B influence was further strengthened by seven years of touring and sessions as a sideman with Day, The Isley Brothers, Bobby Caldwell, Randy Crawford, Teena Marie and others. It was on the road with Crawford in 1986 that he earned his now-famous moniker, when his physique led a bandmate to joke &quot;We&#x27;ll have to start calling you &#x27;Boney&#x27; James!&quot;

In the early 1990s, while on tour with Bobby Caldwell&#x27;s band, he met engineer and producer Paul Brown, beginning a 10-year period of collaboration. 
In 1992 he released his debut album as a leader, &quot;Trust&quot;, on the independent record label Spindletop Records. Following the record&#x27;s success, he was signed by the Warner Brothers label in 1994, on which he released the RIAA Certified Gold Records &quot;Seduction&quot;, &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Body Language&quot; albums.

In 2000 he collaborated with trumpeter Rick Braun on an album called &quot;Shake it Up&quot;. Their duets include the now classic updated version of Hugh Masakela&#x27;s &quot;Grazin&#x27; in the Grass&quot;. Both have appeared regularly on each other&#x27;s solo albums and the two have toured internationally a number of times.
Other artists to have made guest appearances on Boney&#x27;s records include Lalah Hathaway, Raheem DeVaughn, Faith Evans, George Benson, George Duke, Dwele, Al Jarreau, Philip Bailey, Anthony Hamilton, Jaheim, Eric Benét, Dave Hollister, Stokley Williams, Avery*Sunshine, Kenny Lattimore and Angie Stone.

James began co-producing his records with Brown in 1997, and assumed the role of sole producer starting with his Grammy-nominated &quot;Pure&quot; album in 2003. Following a string of chart-topping albums, in 2006 James moved to Concord Records and released &quot;Shine&quot; which posted his highest &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Chart positions to that date (No. 44 on the Top 200). His 2009 album, &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance. His 2013 album &quot;The Beat&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Album.

Returning home from a concert performance on May 15, 2010, his car was rear ended by a drunk driver, causing him a fractured jaw, two shattered teeth and facial lacerations which sidelined his career for two months.

In 2014, he produced two songs on Al Jarreau&#x27;s George Duke tribute album &quot;My Old Friend&quot;, &quot;No Rhyme No Reason&quot; (feat. Kelly Price) and &quot;Bring Me Joy&quot; (feat. George Duke).

In 2015, he released &quot;futuresoul&quot; which spent eleven weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart and was the best selling Contemporary Jazz Record of 2015. In August 2015, James made his first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

2017 saw the release of &quot;Honestly&quot;, his sixteenth album (which also featured production from Nutty P Beats) which became his eleventh No. 1 on the Billboard Jazz Albums Chart. It also reached No. 22 on the Billboard Current Albums Chart, his highest pop chart debut to date.

June 2020 he released his seventeenth studio album &quot;Solid&quot;, describing it as &quot;a reaction to how stressful the world feels these days. Music is a respite, it’s always ‘solid’ and never lets me down.&quot; The CD broke his previous Pop Chart record, debuting at #10 on the Billboard Top Albums Chart. His eighteenth album &quot;Detour&quot; was released on September 23, 2022.

James is married to actress and director Lily Mariye and in 2012 he contributed an original score to her directorial feature film debut, &quot;Model Minority&quot;.

<text>In neuroanatomy, the superior frontal gyrus (SFG, also marginal gyrus) is a gyrus – a ridge on the brain&#x27;s cerebral cortex – which makes up about one third of the frontal lobe. It is bounded laterally by the superior frontal sulcus.

The superior frontal gyrus is one of the frontal gyri.

==Function==

===Self-awareness===
In fMRI experiments, Goldberg &quot;et al.&quot; have found evidence that the superior frontal gyrus is involved in self-awareness, in coordination with the action of the sensory system.

The medial frontal gyrus (MFG) is the medial portion of the superior frontal gyrus. The MFG plays a crucial role implicated in self-reflection and self-awareness, particularly during self-referential processing. The MFG becomes activated when individuals engage in tasks that involve evaluating traits about themselves. This process is essential for maintaining a sense of self. In this study, people with major depressive disorder, also known as MDD, showed heightened and broader activation compared to healthy individuals, indicating that the connection between MDD and the medial frontal gyrus is shown through excessive self-awareness in depression that requires greater cognitive control. This heightened activation is often linked to persistent negative self-focused thoughts. While the medial frontal gyrus plays a role in self-awareness, it also demonstrates altered activity in depression that drives maladaptive self-reflection patterns, furthering the emotional distress and inability to shift focus from negative thoughts.

=== Language ===
The superior frontal gyrus (SFG) has been identified as a brain region that is crucial to language. The SFG is thought to be associated with language functions such as spontaneity and speech initiation. Research into the connection between the gyrus and language began after the tract connecting the SFG and Broca’s area was discovered and named the “frontal aslant tract”. As further research developed investigating this tract, a reciprocal corticocortical network between the two brain regions was revealed, indicating that the language system extends beyond the well-known Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. The newfound importance of the SFG in language has prompted researchers to further evaluate the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in patients with aphasia. A 2023 study found that in patients with aphasia, the treatment group that received speech and language therapy along with rTMS in the SFG exhibited greater treatment efficiency and language improvement than the sham group.

=== Laughter ===
In 1998, neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried described a 16-year-old female patient (referred to as &quot;patient AK&quot;) who laughed when her SFG was stimulated with electric current during treatment for epilepsy. Electrical stimulation was applied to the cortical surface of AK&#x27;s left frontal lobe while an attempt was made to locate the focus of her epileptic seizures (which were never accompanied by laughter).

Fried identified a 2 cm by 2 cm area on the left SFG where stimulation produced laughter consistently (over several trials). AK reported that the laughter was accompanied by a sensation of merriment or mirth. AK gave a different explanation for the laughter each time, attributing it to an (unfunny) external stimulus. Thus, laughter was attributed to the picture she was asked to name (saying &quot;the horse is funny&quot;), or to the sentence she was asked to read, or to persons present in the room (&quot;you guys are just so funny... standing around&quot;).

Increasing the level of stimulation current increased the duration and intensity of laughter.
For example, at low currents only a smile was present, while at higher currents a louder, contagious laughter was induced. The laughter was also accompanied by the stopping of all activities involving speech or hand movements.

=== Working Memory ===
The superior frontal gyrus (SFG) may play a role in executive functions such as self-monitoring, working memory, organization, and planning. In a 2006 study, patients with left prefrontal lesions on the SFG exhibited poorer results on working memory tasks than the control group. Mapping showed the lateral and posterior portions of the SFG contributed the most to the working memory deficit (mostly in Brodmann area 8 in front of the frontal eye field). This study suggests the SFG is involved in executive processing.

== Disorders Associated with Abnormalities of the Superior Frontal Gyrus ==
Abnormalities in the superior frontal gyrus are implicated in emotional and behavioral symptoms. Atrophy in the superior frontal gyrus, characterized by decreased cortical thickness and gray matter volume, is associated with the severe irritability observed in youth with ADHD, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Severe irritability is characterized by excessive sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli and impaired inhibition of anger and reactive aggression. In a 2022 study on depressed patients with severe anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure), the left superior frontal gyrus was shown to have high efficiency as compared to depressed patients without anhedonia. This could indicate a compensatory mechanism in response to anhedonia and could serve as a potential biomarker of anhedonia in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. A 2023 study found a positive correlation between the cortical thickness of the superior frontal gyrus and social anxiety levels in participants with subthreshold social anxiety.

<text>Delmenhorst (; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Demost&quot;) is an urban district (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It has a population of 74,500 and is located west of downtown Bremen with which it forms a contiguous urban area, whereas the city of Oldenburg is to the northwest. The city has a total area of ; and a population density of approx. 1200 inhabitants per km².

Since 2021 the mayor has been Petra Gerlach (CDU).

==History==

Delmenhorst was first mentioned in a charter in 1254, after the Count of Oldenburg, Otto I, bought the place near the river Delme in 1234. A castle to protect the newly founded settlement was established in about 1247. The following count, Otto II, made the castle his residency; Delmenhorst was declared an independent town on 15 July 1371 under Bremen&#x27;s law.

After a short period under the governance of the bishop of Bremen from 1421 to 1436 Delmenhorst returned under the custody of Oldenburg. Delmenhorst later was infamous for its robber-baronship under the count Gerhard VI of Oldenburg. Its reign ended in 1482 thanks to a siege laid to the castle under the leadership of the bishop of Münster. Therefore, the town now was under Münster authority until finally count Anton I won back the town as well as the castle in 1547.

When the last heir of Anton, Christian, died in 1647, Delmenhorst again fell under Oldenburg custody. As Oldenburg belonged to Danish kings and the Oldenburg regent of that time was a relative of the Danish king, Delmenhorst was thereafter under Danish control.

In 1767 Delmenhorst was bought by Tsarina Catherine II, but was given up to new Oldenburg in 1773. In 1777 Delmenhorst was declared a dukedom of Oldenburg. In 1806 a French and Dutch army occupied the territory; Delmenhorst was a part of the French empire under Napoleon from 1811 to 1813.

In the industrial age Delmenhorst experienced great economic growth, thanks to Bremen. Since Bremen was in a different duty zone, merchants who wanted to export manufactured goods outside of Bremen had to pay high customs duties. They therefore only exported the resources and produced their commodities in the surrounding villages. The industries arising were the &quot;Jute&quot; - a spinning works and weavery in 1871, the &quot;Delmenhorster Linoleumfabrik&quot; - a linoleum factory, in 1882, the &quot;Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei&quot; or &quot;Nordwolle&quot; - another, bigger spinning works, and several others. The number of inhabitants quadrupled in these years.

In 1903 Delmenhorst was declared &quot;kreisfrei&quot;, meaning it was under its own regentship, not having to obey any other county. In the 1930s Great Depression the &quot;Nordwolle&quot; went bankrupt - nevertheless the town grew bigger, incorporating several smaller villages around it. On Kristallnacht in November 1938 the synagogue was burnt down by the Nazis, who had come to power in Germany in 1933. After the Second World War, Delmenhorst was in the British zone of occupation and had to deal with thousands of refugees from Eastern Germany, which now was occupied by the Soviet Union. The British-appointed mayor during the British Occupation was Major Jack Wolfe, an inspector of the British Constabulary. In 1950, more than 57,000 people lived in Delmenhorst.

Since the 1960s there has been a steady decrease in employment, leaving more than 13% of the town&#x27;s inhabitants unemployed and nearly 7% living on social welfare. In the year 2000 Delmenhorst was an outpost of the Hanover-based Expo 2000.

The Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) Institute for Advanced Study is located at Delmenhorst, in the neighborhood of Deichhorst. The HWK promotes collaboration between and among international research scientists and artists, many of whom are housed on the HWK grounds. The public is engaged through a public lecture series. The research areas of focus are energy, earth, brain, and society.

==Main sights==
The landmark of the town is the water tower complex with the adjacent town hall, built from 1910 to 1914 by architect Heinz Stoffregen.

Another interesting place is the Burginsel (Castle Island), in which the old castle existed in medieval times. The construction was torn down during the 18th century. Today a park (called the &quot;Graft&quot;) occupies the grounds of the old castle.

The industrial history of the town is presented by the Nordwolle Museum, an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage.

<text>Triesnecker is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the Sinus Medii, near the central part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Its diameter is 25 km. It was named after Austrian astronomer Franz de Paula Triesnecker. It is located to the north-northwest of the crater Rhaeticus, and to the east-southeast of the flooded Murchison.

The crater rim of Triesnecker is somewhat distorted from a circular shape, having a notable bulge in the western wall, and lesser rises in the southeastern and northeastern rims. The inner walls are terraced and the interior is somewhat rough, with a central peak at the midpoint. Triesnecker has a ray system that is most prominent when the sun is at a high angle. The rays extend over 300 kilometers.

To the east of this crater is an extensive system of rilles extending over an area 200 kilometers across, running generally north–south. These were likely created by tectonic forces beneath the surface. Beyond, to the northeast, is the Rima Hyginus valley, with the crater Hyginus at the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Triesnecker.

<text>Richard Elliot (born January 16, 1960) is an American saxophonist. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards for &quot;Summer Horns&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early Life===
Elliot was born in the Scottish Highlands, but moved to Los Angeles, California with his family at the age of three. There, he became smitten with the R&amp;B sound, particularly that of Motown. 

===Career===
Elliot started out as a member of the jazz-rock unit, KittyHawk, playing lyricon (a wind synthesizer) and saxophone, and recording several albums with them. He then became a member of the funk band Tower of Power, playing tenor sax for five years during the 1980s. He also did a stint as a member of the Yellowjackets. He also worked on Stacy Lattisaw&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Take Me All the Way&quot;. His solo career took off when he remade the Percy Sledge classic &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, which had also been remade by Michael Bolton. Other well-known songs include &quot;In the Groove&quot;, &quot;Take Your Time&quot;, &quot;Crush&quot;, &quot;Chill Factor&quot;, &quot;Corner Pocket&quot; and &quot;Sly&quot;, as well as remakes of classic pop songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; and the Luther Vandross hits &quot;Here and Now&quot; and &quot;Your Secret Love&quot;.

Elliot participated with fellow saxophonists Paul Taylor and Gerald Albright, as well as keyboardist Jeff Lorber, in the &quot;Grooving for Grover&quot; concert series. The series honored the legacy of the late Grover Washington Jr.

Elliot was known for his zebra-striped tenor saxophone. In 2011, he switched from LA SAX Saxes to Dakota Saxophones, which the owner, Peter LaPlaca, sold for Dakota.

In 2005, Elliot joined trumpeter Rick Braun to co-found their own label, ARTizen Music Group (now known as Artistry Music). Among the first albums on that label is Elliot&#x27;s own &quot;Metro Blue&quot;.

Elliot played the lyricon on several songs on the album &quot;Mirage a Trois&quot; (1983) by the Yellowjackets.

==Fleet==
===Locomotives===
In 1999 Riviera Trains purchased its first locomotives; 37029 and 47705. Two further Class 47s (47805 and 47839) were acquired from Porterbrook in 2002. Further Class 47s were purchased from Harry Needle Railroad Company (47575 and 47769) and Porterbrook (47812, 47815, 47829, 47843, 47847 and 47848).

<doc id="993430" wikidata="Q362969" url="?curid=993430" title="Bob Martinez">
<text>Robert Martinez (born December 25, 1934) is an American retired politician who served as the 40th governor of Florida from 1987 to 1991. A member of the Republican Party, Martinez was the first person of Spanish descent to be elected governor of Florida.

Martinez was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, attended the University of Tampa, and began his career as an educator in the local public school system and then the University of Tampa. In 1965, he was named the director of the local teachers&#x27; union, a position he held during the Florida statewide teachers&#x27; strike of 1968. He first entered politics with an unsuccessful run for mayor of Tampa in 1974, then won the office in Tampa&#x27;s next mayoral election in 1979 and was reelected in 1983. During his second term as mayor, Martinez switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, upsetting some supporters in heavily Democratic Tampa. He resigned the position in 1986 to focus on his ultimately successful campaign for the governorship of Florida. His single term as governor was controversial due to the passage and repeal of an unpopular state sales tax on services and an anti-obscenity campaign targeting Miami rappers 2 Live Crew, who later recorded a derogatory song attacking Martinez. He lost his reelection campaign to U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles in 1990.

After his time as governor, Martinez was appointed Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy by President George H. W. Bush. Martinez held that position from 1991 until 1993 when he returned to Tampa and became a business consultant and a board member of several local educational organizations.

== Early life and career ==
Bob Martinez was born in Tampa, Florida on December 25, 1934, the only child of Serafín Martínez and Ida Carreño Martínez. His grandparents were Spanish immigrants who had come to Tampa from the province of Asturias to find work in the Spanish/Cuban/Italian neighborhood of Ybor City. Bob Martinez&#x27;s mother was a seamstress and his father was a waiter at the Columbia Restaurant in Ybor City, and the family lived in Ybor City and West Tampa during his youth. Martinez graduated from Jefferson High School in 1953 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Tampa in 1957.

For several years, he taught civics at local high schools. He taught at Oak Grove Junior High for three &amp; half years, starting in 1957.

He then went back to college and earned a master&#x27;s degree in labor and industrial relations at the University of Illinois in 1964 and returned to Tampa, working as a business labor consultant. He also taught as an economics instructor at the University of Tampa, in the summer of 1965.

Shortly after graduating, he taught at Chamberlain High School for three &amp; half years. During his time as a teacher there he became involved with the Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association.

=== HCTA ===
In 1965, Martinez was named the executive director of the Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association (HCTA), the local teachers&#x27; union in Hillsborough County.

In 1968, the HCTA joined the Florida Education Association&#x27;s statewide teacher strike in support of more education funding and collective bargaining rights for teachers. Though the labor action was seemingly unsuccessful in the short term, its goals were gradually met over the following few years through court and legislative actions. In 1971, Martinez and the HCTA negotiated the first union contract for Hillsborough County teachers.

== Political career ==
In 1974, Martinez unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Tampa against William &quot;Bill&quot; Poe. He resigned as executive director of the HCTA in 1975 and was appointed vice-chairman of the Southwest Florida Water Management District by Florida Governor Reubin Askew. He also ran Cafe Sevilla, his family&#x27;s restaurant in West Tampa.

===Mayor of Tampa===

Martinez campaigned for mayor against Poe again in 1979 and won. During Martinez&#x27;s term of office, the city built one of America&#x27;s first waste-to-energy plants, opened a large performing arts center and a modern convention center, completely reconstructed Lowry Park Zoo, restored the 1915 City Hall building, and annexed thousands of acres of unincorporated land northeast of town that would become the neighborhood of New Tampa.

Although the mayor&#x27;s office is nonpartisan, Martinez was known to be a Democrat. However, in 1983, he changed his party affiliation to Republican after meeting with Ronald Reagan when the president was in Tampa to give a speech, causing some dismay among local supporters and leading to speculation that he may eventually run for higher office. Martinez&#x27;s national profile increased in 1984, when he delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention, and in 1985, when he was elected to the board of directors of the National League of Cities.

==Governor of Florida==

===1986 election===
In early 1985, Martinez began actively exploring the possibility of running for governor of Florida, and he formally announced his candidacy in November of that year. In July 1986, he resigned as mayor of Tampa to devote all of his time to the gubernatorial campaign.

Martinez defeated former U.S. Representative Louis Frey Jr., of Winter Park in the Republican gubernatorial primary election and Democratic state representative Steve Pajcic in the 1986 Florida gubernatorial election. With the election victory, Martinez became the second Republican governor of Florida since Reconstruction and the first Hispanic governor in Florida history. He was inaugurated on January 6, 1987.

===Tenure===
As governor, Martinez initiated America&#x27;s largest environmental land acquisition program, Preservation 2000. He proposed the Surface Water Improvement Management Act that protects Florida&#x27;s surface waters, including Lake Okeechobee, Tampa Bay, Lake Jackson, the Kissimmee River, and other areas. He helped get Florida&#x27;s first solid waste management law passed and implemented Florida&#x27;s Growth Management Act. He was an advocate of laws and rules that protected manatees and dolphins. He aggressively sought to eliminate wasteful spending projects sponsored by members of the legislature and increased spending on the state&#x27;s drug control programs. For a time, Martinez was regarded as a &quot;rising star&quot; in Republican politics.

In 1987, following the destruction of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; the previous year, Martinez appointed a number of the aerospace industry and community leaders to the &quot;Florida Governor&#x27;s Commission on Space.&quot; This concept was undertaken by Stephen Lee Morgan, vice chairman and executive director of the Florida Space Business Roundtable, Inc., a non-profit organization of Central Florida aerospace industry executives. Martinez appointed Martin Marietta executive A. Thomas Young as chairman of the commission, with then-Florida Secretary of Commerce Jeb Bush (later Governor of Florida himself), as vice-chairman. The commission was widely hailed as a leader in the arena of state-sponsored economic development initiatives in the aerospace industry, and led to the establishment of the Spaceport Florida Authority, following the release of its formal report, &quot;Steps to the Stars&quot; in 1988 (drafted under the direction of the Florida Department of Commerce&#x27;s Dr. Chris Shove). While now defunct, the Florida Spaceport Authority did orchestrate several commercial launches from unused launch facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, including America&#x27;s return to the Moon with an unmanned orbiting vehicle aboard a Lockheed Martin rocket, the Athena (then called the &quot;Lockheed Launch Vehicle&quot; or &quot;LLV&quot;). The Authority was succeeded by an organization known as &quot;Space Florida.&quot; The purpose of the commission was to identify approaches and specific actions which the State might take to mitigate Florida&#x27;s reliance on the Space Shuttle program as an employer in the space industry. Results were mixed, with some successes and a number of programs that bore little fruit.

In order to raise more revenue for the state, the Florida legislature passed a sales tax on services with Martinez&#x27;s support. The response from Floridians was strongly negative, so only two months after the tax went into effect, Martinez called the legislature back for a special session to repeal it. Though the tax was repealed and replaced by a traditional sales tax on goods, the perceived flip-flop on the issue seriously hurt the governor&#x27;s credibility among Floridians and reduced his ability to get his initiatives enacted.

In 1989, Martinez vowed to &quot;clear Death Row&quot; and signed over 90 death warrants, with only nine of them being successful, including the warrant signed for Ted Bundy. That same year Martinez ordered state prosecutors to determine whether Miami-area rappers 2 Live Crew&#x27;s album &quot;Nasty as They Wanna Be&quot; violated Florida obscenity laws. As a result, record store owners were arrested for selling the album, and members of the group were arrested after a concert. All arrested parties were eventually acquitted. On &quot;Banned in the USA&quot;, their follow-up album, 2 Live Crew included a song entitled &quot;Fuck Martinez&quot;.

In the fall of 1989, after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states greater flexibility to restrict abortions, Martinez promptly called the Florida Legislature into special session in an effort to pass anti-abortion laws. The special session was a debacle as none of the governor&#x27;s proposals made it out of committee and his approval ratings sank to around 24%.

===1990 election===
In 1990, &quot;Time&quot; magazine referred to Martinez as &quot;embattled&quot; as he authorized a statewide television advertisement campaign boasting about his deeds, which were largely unpopular. Martinez was unpopular within his own party by the time of the 1990 gubernatorial election, in which he suffered a landslide defeat against Democratic nominee, former United States Senator Lawton Chiles. As of , Martinez is the last Florida governor to lose reelection.

==Post elected-office==
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office on January 8, 1991, Martinez was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to the cabinet rank position of Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (or &quot;Drug Czar&quot;) where he served until January 20, 1993.

Since then, Martinez has served as a consultant to Florida-based businesses and law firms and is a political analyst for Bay News 9 television. He is a trustee of the University of Tampa, and a director of the Hillsborough Education Foundation, Tampa&#x27;s Lowry Park Zoo and the Tampa Bay History Center, all local nonprofit groups involved in some way with education.

==Personal life==
Bob Martinez married the former Mary Jane Marino in 1954, soon after they graduated from Tampa Jefferson High School. They have two children, Robert Alan Martinez and Sharon Martinez.

<text>Sliabh Luachra (), sometimes anglicised Slieve Logher, is an upland region in Munster, Ireland. It is on the borders of counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick, and bounded to the south by the River Blackwater. It includes the Mullaghareirk Mountains.

==Music and Culture==

Sliabh Luachra has produced several Irish poets: Geoffrey Fionn Dálaigh, Aogán Ó Rathaille, and the charismatic Gaelic poet Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin (1748–1784). This latter poet&#x27;s many exploits live on in local folklore, as do his poetry and aislings (dramatic descriptions). His solo set dance, &quot;Rodney&#x27;s Glory,&quot; was composed in 1783 and follows his adventures after being forced to join the British Navy. Sliabh Luachra was also the birthplace of the folklorist, poet and translator Edward Walsh (1805–1850), actor and storyteller, Eamon Kelly (1914–2001), Patrick S. Dinneen, who compiled Dineen&#x27;s Dictionary, viewed as the &quot;bible&quot; of Irish language, and Tomás Rathaille, Superior General of the Presentation Brothers 1905–1925 who wrote two books of Irish poetry: &quot;An Spideog&quot; and &quot;An Cuaicín Draoidheachta&quot;. This tradition of poetry continues to present day with Bernard O&#x27;Donoghue (now a lecturer in Oxford University) who won the prestigious Whitbread prize for a collection of poems in 1993/94. Professor Daniel Corkery, author of &quot;The Hidden Ireland&quot; wrote that Sliabh Luachra was the literary capital of Ireland.

This region has a unique musical style which makes heavy use of the polka and the slide. Musicians from the area include Denis Murphy, Julia Clifford, Paddy Cronin, Padraig O&#x27;Keeffe, Terence Teahan, Johnny O&#x27;Leary, Maurice O&#x27; Keeffe, Jackie Daly, Con Curtin and Dónal Murphy.

==Religion==

St Moling was born in Sliabh Luachra in 614 AD. On 17 September 1583, during the last stages of the Second Desmond Rebellion, Fr. Muiris Mac Ionrachtaigh, a Roman Catholic priest and the Rebel Earl&#x27;s confessor and chaplain, was captured by Viscount Roche&#x27;s Gallowglass upon Sliabh Luachra. He was hanged at Clonmel on 30 April 1585 and Beatified alongside 16 other Irish Catholic Martyrs by Pope John Paul II on 27 September 1992.

==History==

The mountainous area along the Cork/Kerry border is known as Sliabh Luachra. This uninhabited wet, marshy, rushy, mountain area of the old Kingdom of Luachra was first noted in the Annals of Inisfallen in 534 when the King of Luacar won a battle against Tuathal Moel nGarb. It came to light again in 741 AD with the death of Cuaine, Abbot of Ferna and Flan Ferna, son of Cormac King of Luachra.

Hundreds of years ago, the area was sparsely populated. It was an area of bogs, rushes, marshes, and woodlands, an area only suitable for refugees trying to avoid the imperial authorities. Its remoteness and the barren soil proved attractive to those people as the authorities were less likely to bother them in their inhospitable environment.

Settlement did not come to the remaining thousand square miles of Sliabh Luachra until the Desmond rebellion. This rebellion ended with the death of Gerald Fitzgerald, the 15th Earl of Desmond in 1583. His last hiding place, Teach an Iarla, can still be seen cut into a glen in the heart of the Sliabh Luachra mountains near the source of the river Blackwater. The rebellion resulted in the scorched earth policy of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s army, which devastated much of Munster. Men, women and children were put to the sword and land and crops were burned, resulting in a great famine, impacting the area from Ventry to Cashel.

Following this devastation, Munster began restoration with a half a million acres being declared Crown property and being distributed to English landlords. Former inhabitants were ordered to relocate to Connacht. Some of the dispossessed and poverty stricken people of Munster took refuge in Sliabh Luachra, which was also Crown property. Much of this land was recorded as mountain pastures; however, the authorities were unsuccessful at its distribution to landlords.

This area remained undisturbed and largely unaccounted for until the agrarian disturbances of the Rockite movement in the 1820s. The Rockite movement began in West Limerick in the summer of 1821. The first leader of the Rockite movement, known as Captain Rock, was a Patrick Dillane who may have come from the Sliabh Luachra area. Many of the leaders of the movement hid in Sliabh Luachra, thereby creating British Government concern over the area&#x27;s preponderance of outlaws and rebels. Further, the Government was not receiving any revenues from the area and was unable to control the 960 square miles due to lack of roads and communication.

A report by James Weale on the Crown Lands of County Cork addressed the Government&#x27;s apprehensions in the House of Commons. It also pointed out that, in the summer, farmers from North Kerry and parts of West Limerick would transport butter on horseback via a mountain path through the Rockchapel to Newmarket, two firkins per horse. There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 firkins and sent on to the largest butter market in the world in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 firkins valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the Rockchapel mountain path.

This report then initiated a program of road building, including the road from Castle Island to Clonbanin, from Ballydesmond to Newmarket, and the new line road, along the Feale Valley from Feales Bridge through Rockchapel to Newmarket, The engineering work on these roads and bridges was completed by Richard Griffith, who later became well known in Ireland through his Griffith valuations of 1852. The report also created the village of Kingwilliamstown (Ballydesmond), as was a model farm at Glencollins near Ballydesmond. Here, it was demonstrated that good grass could be grown on peaty soil by the use of burnt lime, resulting in the building of lime kilns in and around the Sliabh Luachra area.

In 1896, Gneeveeguilla was the scene of the devastating moving bog, a landslide which wiped out an entire family as they slept.

The first Auxiliary Division fatality was killed in Rathmore on 10 July 1920.

The Headford Ambush took place at Barraduff in 1921. Thirty-two IRA volunteers ambushed a train carrying British soldiers. A total of sixteen people died including ten British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and four civilians.

==Geography==

Opinions differ as to the exact region of Sliabh Luachra, but it is generally accepted to refer to the mountainous, rush-filled upland that straddles the border area of Cork, Kerry, and Limerick, including the Kerry parishes of Ballymacelligott, Cordal, Brosna, Currow, Knocknagoshel, Barraduff, Gneeveguilla, Scartaglen and Rathmore, the Cork villages of Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Rockchapel, Knocknagree, Cullen, Boherbue, Meelin, and Freemount, and the Limerick villages of Killeedy, Tournafulla, Templeglantine, Athea, Mountcollins and Abbeyfeale

==Etymology==

The name Sliabh Luachra means &quot;a mountain of rushes&quot;. However, it is not a single mountain, but a rolling plateau interspersed with what is generally accepted as its seven glens, or &#x27;seacht ngleann Shliabh Luachra&#x27;, over which various mountain peaks reach heights of 500 metres.

<text>The Battle of Arras, also known as the Second Battle of Arras, was a British offensive on the Western Front during the First World War. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front. The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun, surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. The British advance slowed in the next few days and the German defence recovered. The battle became a costly stalemate for both sides and by the end of the battle, the British Third Army and the First Army had suffered about 160,000 casualties and the German 6th Army about 125,000.

For much of the war, the opposing armies on the Western Front were at a stalemate, with a continuous line of trenches from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. The Allied objective from early 1915 was to break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German Army () in a war of movement. The British attack at Arras was part of the Anglo-French Nivelle Offensive, the main part of which was the Second Battle of the Aisne to the south. The aim of the French offensive was to break through the German defences in forty-eight hours. At Arras the Canadians were to capture Vimy Ridge, dominating the Douai Plain to the east, advance towards Cambrai and divert German reserves from the French front.

The British effort was an assault on a relatively broad front between Vimy in the north-west and Bullecourt to the south-east. After a long preparatory bombardment, the Canadian Corps of the First Army in the north fought the Battle of Vimy Ridge, capturing the ridge. The Third Army in the centre advanced astride the Scarpe River and in the south, the Fifth Army attacked the Hindenburg Line () but made few gains. The British armies then conducted smaller attacks to consolidate the new positions. Although these battles were generally successful in achieving limited aims, they came at considerable cost.

When the battle officially ended on 16 May, the British had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed the lessons of the Battle of the Somme and could mount set-piece attacks against field fortifications. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector became a quiet front, typical of most of the war in the west, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).
==Background==
At the beginning of 1917, the British and French were still searching for a way to achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the River Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders&#x27; belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.

===Home fronts===

The mid-war years were momentous times. Governing politicians in Paris and London were under great pressure from the press, the people and their parliaments to win the war. Hundreds of thousands of casualties had been suffered at the battles of Gallipoli, the Somme and Verdun, with little prospect of victory in sight. The British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, resigned in early December 1916 and was succeeded by David Lloyd George. In France, Prime Minister Aristide Briand, along with Minister of Defence Hubert Lyautey were politically diminished and resigned in March 1917, following disagreements over the prospective Nivelle Offensive. The United States was close to declaring war on Germany; American public opinion was growing increasingly incensed by U-boat attacks upon civilian shipping, which had begun with the sinking of in 1915 and culminated in the torpedoing of seven American merchantmen in early 1917. The United States Congress declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917 but it would be more than a year before a suitable army could be raised, trained and transported to France.

===Strategy===
The French, Russians and British had intended to launch a joint spring offensive in 1917 but this strategy foundered in February when the Russians admitted that they could not meet their commitments. The spring offensive was reduced from attacks on the Eastern and Western fronts to a French assault along the Aisne River. In March, the German army in the west (), withdrew to the Hindenburg line in Operation Alberich, negating the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive. Until French troops advanced into the former Noyon Salient during the Battles of Arras, they encountered no German troops in the assault sector and French doubts over the wisdom of the offensive increased. The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding, given the rapidly changing tactical situation. In a meeting with Lloyd George, French commander-in-chief General Robert Nivelle persuaded the British Prime Minister, that if the British launched a diversionary assault to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January, that the French assault on the Aisne would begin in mid-April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior.

===Tactics: British Expeditionary Force===
Three of the armies of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig) were in the Arras sector, the Fifth Army (General Hubert Gough) in the south, the Third Army (General Edmund Allenby) in the centre and the First Army (General Henry Horne) in the north and the plan was devised by Allenby. The British used the lessons of the Somme and Verdun the previous year and planned to attack on an front, from Vimy Ridge in the north to Neuville-Vitasse, south of the Scarpe river. The preliminary bombardment was planned to last about a week except for a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy Ridge.

====Division attack training====
In December 1916, the training manual replaced of 8 May 1916 and marked a significant step in the evolution of the BEF into a homogeneous force, well adapted to its role on the Western Front. The duties of army, corps and divisions in planning attacks were standardised. Armies were to devise the plan and the principles of the artillery component. Corps were to allot tasks to divisions, which would then select objectives and devise infantry plans subject to corps approval. Artillery planning was controlled by corps with consultation of divisions by the corps General Officer Commanding, Royal Artillery (GOCRA) which became the title of the officer at each level of command who devised the bombardment plan, which was coordinated with neighbouring corps artillery commanders by the army GOCRA. Specific parts of the bombardment were nominated by divisions, using their local knowledge and the results of air reconnaissance. The corps artillery commander was to co-ordinate counter-battery fire and the howitzer bombardment for zero hour. Corps controlled the creeping barrage but divisions were given authority over extra batteries added to the barrage, which could be switched to other targets by the divisional commander and brigade commanders. provided the basis for the operational technique of the BEF for the rest of 1917.

====Platoon attack training====

The training manual of February 1917 marked the end of attacks made by lines of infantry with a few detached specialists. The platoon was divided into a small headquarters and four sections, one with two trained grenade-throwers and assistants, the second with a Lewis gunner and nine assistants carrying of ammunition, the third section comprised a sniper, scout and nine riflemen and the fourth section had nine men with four rifle-grenade launchers. The rifle and hand-grenade sections were to advance in front of the Lewis-gun and rifle-grenade sections, in two waves or in &quot;artillery formation&quot;, which covered an area wide and deep, with the four sections in a diamond pattern, the rifle section ahead, rifle grenade and bombing sections to the sides and the Lewis gun section behind, until resistance was met. German defenders were to be suppressed by fire from the Lewis-gun and rifle-grenade sections, while the riflemen and hand-grenade sections moved forward, preferably by infiltrating around the flanks of the resistance, to overwhelm the defenders from the rear.

The changes in equipment, organisation and formation were elaborated in &quot;The Normal Formation For the Attack&quot; of February 1917, which recommended that the leading troops should push on to the final objective, when only one or two were involved but that for a greater number of objectives, when artillery covering fire was available for the depth of the intended advance, fresh platoons should &quot;leap-frog&quot; through the leading platoons to the next objective. The new organisations and equipment gave the infantry platoon the capacity for fire and manoeuvre, even in the absence of adequate artillery support. To bring uniformity in adoption of the methods laid down in the revised manuals and others produced over the winter, Haig established a BEF Training Directorate in January 1917, to issue manuals and oversee training. and its companion manuals provided British infantry with &quot;off-the-peg&quot; tactics, devised from the experience of the Somme and from French Army operations, to go with new equipment made available by increasing British and Allied war production and better understanding of the organisation necessary to exploit it in battle.

===Tactics: German army===
In a new manual published on 1 December 1916 by (OHL, supreme command of the German army), (Principles of Command for Defensive Battles in Positional Warfare), the policy of unyielding defence of ground, regardless of its tactical value, was replaced by the defence of positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear, where an attacking force would &quot;fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength&quot;. Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts, which were kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a (battle zone), a second defensive area deep, on ground hidden from enemy observation, as far as possible while in view of German artillery observers. A (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment.

 (Principles of Field Fortification) was published by OHL in January 1917 and by April an outpost zone () held by sentries, had been built along the Western Front. Sentries could retreat to larger positions () held by (five men and an NCO per ), who would join the sentries to recapture sentry-posts by immediate counter-attack. Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with bigger units. The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison, which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire and then counter-attack to recover the battle and outpost zones; such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire, as the prelude to (immediate counter-attack within the position). Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions. Resistance from troops equipped with automatic weapons, supported by observed artillery fire, would increase the further the advance progressed. A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods.

Given the growing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection line), leaving in their wake German garrisons isolated in resistance nests () still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the and dig in near the German second line, and of the counter-attack divisions would advance from the into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack (). If the immediate counter-attack failed, counter-attack divisions would take their time to prepare a methodical attack if the lost ground was essential to the retention of the main position. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions ready to move to the battlefront. The reserve was obtained by creating by internal reorganisation of the army, bringing divisions from the eastern front and by shortening the Western Front, in Operation Alberich. By the spring of 1917, the German army in the west had a strategic reserve of 

====German 6th Army====
&quot;Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles&quot;, () was published on 30 January 1917 by Ludendorff but new defensive methods were controversial. During the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel Fritz von Loßberg (Chief of Staff of the 1st Army) had been able to establish a line of relief divisions (), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which began to arrive in greater numbers in September. In his analysis of the battle, Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre would not evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and invited French or British infantry to occupy vacant areas. Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the means to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wide area had already made difficult. Loßberg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter-attack () from behind the battle zone. Sceptics wanted the tactic of fighting in the front line to continue, with authority devolved no further than battalion, to maintain organizational coherence in anticipation of a methodical counter-attack () by the relief divisions after Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by Loßberg&#x27;s memorandum to add it to the new &quot;Manual of Infantry Training for War&quot;.

General Ludwig von Falkenhausen, commander of the 6th Army arranged the infantry at Arras for the rigid defence of the front-line, supported by methodical counter-attacks (), by the &quot;relief&quot; divisions () on the second or third day. Five were placed behind Douai, away from the front line. The new Hindenburg line ended at Telegraph Hill between Neuville-Vitasse and Tilloy lez Mofflaines, from whence the original system of four lines apart, ran north to the Neuville St Vaast–Bailleul-aux-Cornailles road. About behind were the Wancourt–Feuchy and to the north the Point du Jour lines, running from the Scarpe river north along the east slope of Vimy ridge. The new &quot;Wotan&quot; line, which extended the Hindenburg position, was built around further back and not entirely mapped by the Allies until the battle had begun.

Just before the battle, Falkenhausen had written that parts of the front line might be lost but the five could be brought forward to relieve the front divisions on the evening of the second day. On 6 April, General Karl von Nagel, the 6th Army Chief of Staff, accepted that some of the front divisions might need to be relieved on the first evening of battle but that any penetrations would be repulsed with local immediate counter-attacks () by the front divisions. On 7 April, Nagel viewed the imminent British attack as a limited effort against Vimy ridge, preparatory to a bigger attack later, perhaps combined with the French attack expected in mid-April. Construction of positions to fulfil the new policy of area defence had been drastically curtailed by shortages of labour and the long winter, which affected the setting of concrete. The 6th Army commanders had also been reluctant to encourage the British to change their plans if the British detected a thinning of the front line. The Germans were inhibited by the extent of British air reconnaissance, which observed new field works and promptly directed artillery fire on them. The 6th Army failed to redeploy its artillery, which remained in lines easy to see and bombard. Work on defences was also divided between maintaining the front line, strengthening the third line and the new (Drocourt–Quéant switch line) further back.

==Prelude==
===British preparations===

====Underground====

After the Allied conference at Chantilly, Haig issued instructions for army commanders on 17 November 1916, with a general plan for offensive operations in the spring of 1917. The Chief engineer of the Third Army, Major-General E. R. Kenyon, composed a list of requirements by 19 November, for which he had 16 Army Troops companies, five with each corps in the front line and one with XVIII Corps, four tunnelling companies, three entrenching battalions, eight RE labour battalions and 37 labour companies. Inside the old walls of Arras were the Grand Place and Petit Place, under which there were old cellars, which were emptied and refurbished for the accommodation of 13,000 men. Under the suburbs of St Sauveur and Ronville were many caves, some huge, which were rediscovered by accident in October 1916. When cleared out, the caves had room for 11,500 men, one in the Ronville system housing 4,000 men. The Crinchon sewer followed the ditch of the old fortifications and tunnels were dug from the cellars to the sewer.

Two long tunnels were excavated from the Crinchon sewer, one through the St Sauveur and one through the Ronville system, allowing the 24,500 troops safely sheltered from German bombardment to move forward underground, avoiding the railway station, an obvious target for bombardment. The St Sauveur tunnel followed the line of the road to Cambrai and had five shafts in no man&#x27;s land but the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line forestalled the use of the Ronville tunnels, when the German front line was withdrawn and there was no time to extend the diggings. The subterranean workings were lit by electricity and supplied by piped water, with gas-proof doors at the entrances; telephone cables, exchanges and testing-points used the tunnels, a hospital was installed and a tram ran from the sewer to the St Sauveur caves. The observation post for the VI Corps heavy artillery off the St Sauveur tunnel, had a telephone exchange with 750 circuits; much of the work in this area being done by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company.

On the First Army front German sappers also conducted underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine, in which 41 New Zealand tunnellers were killed and 151 wounded. The British tunnellers had gained an advantage over the German miners by the Autumn of 1916, which virtually ended the German underground threat. The British turned to digging 12 subways about down, to the front line, the longest tunnel being long of the dug. In one sector, four Tunnelling companies of 500 men each, worked around-the-clock in 18-hour shifts for two months to dig of subways for foot traffic, tramways with rails for hand-drawn trolleys and a light railway system. Most tunnels were lit by electricity, accommodated telephone cables and some had trams and water supplies. Caverns were dug into the sides for brigade and battalion HQs, first aid posts and store-rooms. The subways were found to be a most efficient way to relieve troops in the line, form up for the attack and then to evacuate wounded. Some of the tunnels were continued into Russian saps with exits in mine craters in no man&#x27;s land and new mines were laid. Galleries were dug to be opened after the attack for communication or cable trenches, the work being done by the 172nd, 176th, 182nd and 185th Tunnelling companies (Lieutenant-Colonel G. C. Williams, Controller of Mines First Army).

====War in the air====

Although the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) entered the battle with inferior aircraft to the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, this did not deter their commander, General Trenchard, from adopting an offensive posture. Dominance of the air over Arras was essential for reconnaissance and the British carried out many aerial patrols. RFC aircraft carried out artillery spotting, photography of trench systems and bombing. Aerial observation was hazardous work as, for best results, the aircraft had to fly at slow speeds and low altitude over the German defences. It became even more dangerous with the arrival of the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen in March 1917. The presence of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11 led to sharply increased losses of Allied pilots and April 1917, became known as Bloody April. A German infantry officer later wrote,

The average flying life of a RFC pilot in Arras in April was 18 hours and from 4 to 8 April, the RFC lost 75 aircraft and 105 aircrew. The casualties created a pilot shortage and replacements were sent to the front straight from flying school; during the same period, 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots.

===Artillery===

To keep enemy action to a minimum during the assault, a creeping barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres in advance of the assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the Battle of the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.

The principal danger to assaulting troops came from enemy artillery fire as they crossed no man&#x27;s land, accounting for over half the casualties at the first day of the Somme. A further complication was the location of German artillery, hidden as it was behind the ridges. In response, specialist artillery units were created to attack German artillery. Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers, who collated data obtained from flash spotting and sound ranging. (Flash spotting required Royal Flying Corps observers to record the location of telltale flashes made by guns whilst firing.) On Zero-Day, 9 April, over 80 per cent of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised (that is, &quot;unable to bring effective fire to bear, the crews being disabled or driven off&quot;) by counter-battery fire. Gas shells were also used against the draught horses of the batteries and to disrupt ammunition supply columns.

====Tanks====
Forty tanks of the 1st Brigade were to be used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be attacked by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.

==Battle==
===First phase===
The preliminary bombardment of Vimy Ridge started on 20 March; and the bombardment of the rest of the sector on 4 April. Limited to a front of only , the bombardment used 2,689,000 shells, over a million more than had been used on the Somme. German casualties were not heavy but the men became exhausted by the endless task of keeping open dug-out entrances and demoralised by the absence of rations caused by the difficulties of preparing and moving hot food under bombardment. Some went without food altogether for two or three consecutive days. By the eve of battle, the front-line trenches had ceased to exist and their barbed wire defences were blown to pieces. The official history of the 2nd Bavarian Reserve Regiment describes the front line as &quot;consisting no longer of trenches but of advanced nests of men scattered about&quot;. The 262nd Reserve Regiment history writes that its trench system was &quot;lost in a crater field&quot;. To add to the misery, for the last ten hours of bombardment, gas shells were added.

Zero-Hour had originally been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours at the request of the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. Zero-Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, it was snowing heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man&#x27;s land were hindered by large drifts. It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers&#x27; backs blowing &quot;a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans&quot;. The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dugouts of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches.

====First Battle of the Scarpe (9–14 April 1917)====

The main British assault of the first day was directly east of Arras, with the 12th (Eastern) Division attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras–Cambrai road. After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, the second and third German positions. At the same time, elements of the 3rd Division began an assault south of the road, with the Devil&#x27;s Wood, Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives. The ultimate objective of these assaults was the , a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy and an important component of the German defences. Most of these objectives, including Feuchy village, had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly in the area of the fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse.

The following day, troops from the 56th (1/1st London) Division were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the was not fully in British hands until a few days later. The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards Monchy-le-Preux, although they suffered many casualties in fighting near the village. One reason for the success of the offensive in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, an attacker would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.

====Battle of Vimy Ridge (9–12 April 1917)====

At roughly the same time, in perhaps the most carefully crafted portion of the entire offensive, the Canadian Corps launched an assault on Vimy Ridge. Advancing behind a creeping barrage and making heavy use of machine guns – eighty to each brigade, including one Lewis gun in each platoon – the corps was able to advance through about of German defences and captured the crest of the ridge at about 13:00 on 10 April. Military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng and his subordinate General Arthur Currie, constant training and the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon. By giving units specific goals, troops could continue the attack even if their officers were killed or communication broke down, thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front. The Canadian troops could see the Germans in retreat across the Douai Plain away from the ridge. There was nevertheless an inflexibility to the plan which prevented the leading troops from continuing the advance and on 10 April the Germans began to stop the gaps with reserves.

===Second phase===

After the territorial gains of the first two days, a lull followed as British guns, ammunition and transport links were moved forward. Battalions of pioneers built temporary roads across the churned up battlefield; heavy artillery (and its ammunition) was manhandled into position in new gun pits; food for the men and feed for the draught horses was brought up and Casualty Clearing Stations were established in readiness for the inevitable counter-attacks. Allied commanders also faced a dilemma: whether to keep their exhausted divisions on the attack and run the risk of having insufficient manpower or replace them with fresh divisions and lose momentum.

The news of the battle reached General Ludendorff during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach who wrote, &quot;I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed&quot;. He telephoned each of his commanders and &quot;gained the impression that the principles laid down by &quot;OHL&quot; were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly&quot;. (A later court of inquiry found that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. On 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen&#x27;s chief of staff and replaced him with Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with (the right to issue orders in the army commander&#x27;s name) and within hours, Loßberg began to restructure the German defence. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.

====Second Battle of the Scarpe (23–24 April 1917)====

At 04:45 on 23 April, following two days of poor visibility and freezing weather, VI Corps and VII Corps attacked to the east on a front from Croisilles to Gavrelle, either side of the Scarpe. The 51st (Highland) Division attacked on the northern side in determined fighting on the western outskirts of Roeux Wood and the chemical works. On their left, the 37th Division, attacked the buildings west of Roeux Station and gained the line of their objectives on the western slopes of Greenland Hill, north of the railway. On the left of the main attack, the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division made rapid progress against Gavrelle and secured the village. To the south of the Scarpe and east of Monchy-le-Preux the 29th Division gained the western slopes of Infantry Hill.

The Cojeul river marked a divisional boundary within VI Corps. Guémappe on the north side of the river was the objective of the 15th (Scottish) Division, attacking east from Wancourt towards Vis-en-Artois. The objective was commanded by the higher ground on the south bank and it was not until the 50th (Northumbrian) Division captured the rise on the south side of the Cojeul that the village was taken. Several determined German counter-attacks were made and by the morning of 24 April, the British held Guémappe, Gavrelle and the high ground overlooking Fontaine-lès-Croisilles and Cherisy; the fighting around Roeux was indecisive.

====Battle of Arleux (28–29 April 1917)====

The principal objective of the attack was to tie down German reserves to assist the French offensive against the plateau north of the Aisne traversed by the Chemin des Dames. Haig reported,

Although the Canadian Corps had taken Vimy Ridge, difficulties in securing the south-eastern flank had left the position vulnerable. To rectify this, British and Canadian troops launched an attack towards Arleux on 28 April. The village was captured by Canadian troops with relative ease but the British troops advancing on Gavrelle met stiffer resistance. The village was secured by early evening but when a German counter-attack forced a brief retreat, elements of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division were brought up as reinforcements and the village was held. Subsequent attacks on 29 April failed to capture more ground. The attacks achieved the limited objective of securing the Canadian position on Vimy Ridge but casualties were high and the result was disappointing.

====Third Battle of the Scarpe (3–4 May 1917)====
After securing the area around Arleux at the end of April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the and reach the , another German defensive position in the Douai Plain. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. The British launched another attack using regiments from the 4th Division near the Scarpe on 3 May. Neither effort made a significant advance and the attack was called off the following day after incurring many casualties. The British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they used in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.

==Flanking operations (Round Bullecourt, 11 April – 16 June)==

===First attack on Bullecourt===

====8–10 April====


The Hindenburg Line defences enclosing the village of Bullecourt formed a re-entrant for about to the (Balcony Trench) around Quéant, defended by the German 27th Division. On 8 April it was announced that wire cutting, begun on 5 April, would take another eight days. At dusk on 9 April, patrols went forward and found that the Hindenburg Line was occupied but that the wire cutting bombardment had made several lanes through the wire. Preparations were made in a rush, the 4th Australian Division to attack with two brigades, the 4th on the right and 12th on the left. The attack had to cover to the wire and another to the first trench at about an hour and 48 minutes before the sun rose to evade crossfire in the re-entrant between Quéant and Bullecourt. Artillery-fire would continue as normal until zero hour then maintain barrages on the flanks.

At Bullecourt was subjected to a gas bombardment by Livens projectors and Stokes 4-inch mortars as the Australians assembled and waited for the tanks to arrive. Six battalions were out in the snow of no man&#x27;s land. The left of the 12th Australian Brigade was only from Bullecourt and dawn was approaching. Zero hour was put back but the tanks had only reached Noreuil and Holmes ordered the infantry back under cover; snow began to fall again and shielded the retirement. Patrols of the 2/7th and 2/8th battalions, West Yorkshire Regiment began to advance from and at the patrols began to retire. The patrols suffered 

====11 April====

At a conference at the 4th Australian Division HQ, it was decided that the infantry would advance fifteen minutes after the tanks, rather than wait on a signal from them. Only four tanks reached their start line by but drowning the sound of their engines with machine-gun fire failed and they were heard in the German defences. The tank on the right flank deviated to the right, suffered mechanical difficulties and returned to the railway. Another tank also veered right and crossed the first trench of the opposite Grenadier Regiment 123 and was knocked out by machine-guns firing armour-piercing (K bullet) ammunition. The next tank to reach the German lines was snagged by wire, then crossed the first trench before being knocked out. The last tank started late and followed a similar path to the first. The four tanks comprising the left-hand section were late and two were knocked out short of the German trenches; the third tank arrived behind the Australian infantry and silenced a machine-gun in Bullecourt. The tank was hit twice, returned to the railway and was hit again.
The Australian infantry in the German defences were cut off and the 4th Australian Brigade was forced back; many of its troops were taken prisoner and those who tried to retreat suffered many more casualties. In the 12th Australian Brigade, the 46th Australian Battalion in the first trench was forced out and the 48th Australian Battalion further forward was surrounded. The artillery of the 2nd Guard Division and 220th Division added to the barrage in no man&#x27;s land and prevented another Australian attack. As the Australians were being forced back, they were unable to salvage ammunition and grenades from the dead and wounded. The British and Australian artillery had eventually begun to fire but this fell on the Australian-occupied trenches, making them untenable. At the 48th Australian Battalion, the last in the German trenches, made an orderly retreat over the bullet-swept ground. By noon the German counter-attack had succeeded; few Australians had managed to re-cross no man&#x27;s land through artillery and machine-gun fire.

===German attack on Lagnicourt (15 April 1917)===

Observing that the 1st Australian Division was holding a frontage of , the local German corps commander General Otto von Moser, commanding (XIV Reserve Corps) planned a spoiling attack to drive back the advanced posts, destroy supplies and guns and then retire to the Hindenburg defences. OHL had added an extra division to his and added two more from to the south, further to strengthen the attack. The four divisions provided 23 battalions for (Operation Battering Ram). The German forces managed to penetrate the Australian front line at the junction on the 1st Australian Division and 2nd Australian Division, occupying the village of Lagnicourt and destroyed six Australian artillery pieces. Counter-attacks from the 9th and 20th Australian battalions restored the front line and the action ended with the Germans having suffered and the Australians .

===Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May 1917)===
After the initial assault around Bullecourt failed to penetrate the German lines, British commanders made preparations for a second attempt. British artillery began an intense bombardment of the village, which by 20 April had been virtually destroyed. Although the infantry assault was planned for 20 April, it was postponed several times until early morning of 3 May. At 03:45, elements of the 2nd Australian Division attacked east of Bullecourt village, intending to pierce the Hindenburg Line and capture Hendecourt-lès-Cagnicourt, while British troops from the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division attacked Bullecourt, which was finally taken by the 7th Division and despite determined counter-attacks was held by the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division. German resistance was fierce and when the offensive was called off on 17 May, few of the initial objectives had been met. The Australians were in possession of much of the German trench system between Bullecourt and Riencourt-lès-Cagnicourt but had been unable to capture Hendecourt. To the west, British troops managed to push the Germans out of Bullecourt but incurred considerable losses, failing also to advance north-east to Hendecourt.
==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

By the standards of the Western Front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of tactically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. The offensive drew German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties after the first two days and the failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to break through and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented &quot;no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I have never been able to discover what they were&quot;. Ludendorff was also &quot;very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what on Earth
was to be done?&quot;

===Awards===
On the Allied side, twenty-five Victoria Crosses were awarded. On the German side, on 24 April 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm awarded Loßberg the Oakleaves (similar to a bar for a repeat award) for the Pour le Mérite he had received at the Battle of the Somme the previous September.

===Casualties===

The most quoted Allied casualty figures are those in the returns made by Lieutenant-General Sir George Fowke, the Adjutant-General. Fowke collated the daily casualty tallies kept by each unit under Haig&#x27;s command and his findings were endorsed by the official historian Cyril Falls in 1940. Third Army casualties were 87,226, the First Army suffered 46,826 (including 11,004 Canadians at Vimy Ridge) and the Fifth Army 24,608 casualties, a total of 158,660. German losses are more difficult to determine. and suffered 79,418 casualties but the figures for are incomplete. Wolfgang Foerster, the editor of the German official history volume for early 1917 (1939), recorded casualties, losses to the end of April and another by the end of May, a total of German records excluded the &quot;lightly wounded&quot;. Captain Cyril Falls, the author of the History of the Great War volume on the battle (1940), estimated that 30 per cent needed to be added to German returns for comparison with the British. Falls made &quot;a general estimate&quot; that German casualties were &quot;probably fairly equal&quot;. Nicholls puts them at 120,000 and Keegan at 130,000.

===Commanders===

Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the &quot;great initial success&quot;; Allenby&#x27;s subordinates &quot;objected to the way he handled the ... attritional stage&quot; and he was sacked and transferred to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. He regarded the transfer as a &quot;badge of failure&quot; but &quot;more than redeemed his reputation by defeating&quot; the Ottomans in battles that were fought in the Sinai and Palestine campaign from 1917 to 1918. Haig stayed in his post until the end of the war. When the failures of the 6th Army command became apparent, Ludendorff removed Falkenhausen (who never held a field command again, spending the rest of the war as Governor-General of Belgium) and several staff officers. Ludendorff and Loßberg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position, they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile, clever defence. Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in manoeuvre warfare for the divisions. Loßberg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the Flanders Offensive of the summer and late autumn; he had become &quot;legendary as the fireman of the Western Front; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis&quot;.

===Literature and music===
Siegfried Sassoon makes reference to the battle in the poem &quot;The General&quot;. The Anglo-Welsh lyric poet Edward Thomas was killed by a shell on 9 April 1917, during the first day of the Easter Offensive. Thomas&#x27;s war diary gives a vivid and poignant picture of life on the Western front in the months leading up to the battle. C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Proust, was severely wounded on 23 April 1917 leading an assault on the German trenches outside Monchy-le-Preux (for which he was awarded the MC) and the composer Ernest John Moeran was wounded during the attack on Bullecourt on 3 May 1917.

<doc id="993446" wikidata="Q333081" url="?curid=993446" title="Lucien Rosengart">
<text>Lucien Rosengart (11 January 1881 in Paris, France – 27 July 1976) was a French engineer.

His early life was shaped by carriages and the advance of the automobile age. He first started working as a mechanic at the age of 12, and by age 24 he had a machine shop in Belleville and several patents to his credit. By 1914 his products included railway parts, bicycle parts, and a rocket that allowed artillery shells to be exploded while airborne. This attracted the attention of the French Government and they set him up with two factories, one in Paris and one in Saint-Brieuc - at this point he began working with Andre Citroën&#x27;s company, which provided the shells. By the end of the first world war, he&#x27;d become a skilled businessman and helped both Peugeot and Citroën stave off bankruptcy. Involvement with these companies led Rosengart to think of building his own car. He was already making bicycles.

==Automobiles L. Rosengart==

In 1927, he saw the opportunity to produce a very small car for a segment of the market in France that was not at that time being covered by any of the major players. He bought the old Bellanger factory at Neuilly. 

The early Rosengart cars were licensed copies of the British Austin 7. This model, the LR2, was dressed up in various ways using various styling techniques and remained in production for quite some time - surviving as the vastly facelifted LR4 and Vivor long after the British car had been consigned to history.

In the early 1930s Rosengart teamed up with the German manufacturer Adler, offering license built copies of the Adler Trumpf and Trumpf Junior, small front-drive cars that bolstered its range. It also added a conventional rear-driven car along the lines of a stretched and widened Austin. The development of front-wheel drive models led to the elegant &quot;Supertraction&quot; model in 1937 - which competed with larger cars like the Peugeot 402 and the Berliet Dauphine for the first time in Rosengart&#x27;s short history.

In their November 1979 issue, Belgian magazine &quot;Le Soir Illustre&quot; (No. 2471 on page 26) claimed that Lucien Rosengart had come up with the game of table soccer in the 1930s, when he was looking for things to keep his grandchildren entertained during the cold winter months. He called the game &quot;babyfoot&quot; rather than foosball. 

In 1936 Rosengart himself was in financial difficulties so he transferred the company to a new organisation, Societé Industrielle de l&#x27;Ouest Parisien (SIOP).

Unfortunately production of the Supertraction was never large, and the company was devastated by the Nazi invasion of France. The company was able to survive the German occupation of France until after the war but did not produce cars during the conflict. After the war Rosengart, who had been in the United States (while his son stayed in the south of France), tried to guide his company back to the small cars that had made it a success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Unfortunately, the major manufacturers of France were by then making very small, economical cars that were very well suited to the conditions of post-war France. The last Rosengart car, the &quot;Ariette&quot;, was produced from 1947 to 1954, but failed to sell. The company closed its doors in the summer of 1955, after failing to launch its new car, the &quot;Sagaie&quot;, a development of the Ariette with a flat-twin engine.

Lucien Rosengart died at his home near Nice.

== Personal life ==
Rosengart was married to Titanic survivor Virginia Ethel Emanuel (Martin) but was widowed in 1936. They had a son, Jean-Louis Rosengart (1932-2005).

<text>Hilary &quot;Harry&quot; Douglas Clark Pepler (1878–1951) was an English printer, writer and poet. He was an associate of both Eric Gill and G. K. Chesterton, working on publications in which they had an interest. He was also a founder with Gill and Desmond Chute in 1920 of a Catholic community of craftsmen at Ditchling, Sussex, called The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic.

==Life==
His background was Quaker. He was born at Eastbourne and educated at Bootham School. In the early 1900s, Pepler moved to Hammersmith, London with his wife Clare Whiteman. Pepler became deeply involved in the aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the politics of Fabianism. He became friends with Edward Johnston and, during World War I, met Eric Gill through the Hampshire House Workshops. At that time, Pepler was a social worker for the London County Council, and organised the first London school meals service. Pepler and Gill were together mostly responsible for the Ditchling house magazine, &quot;The Game&quot;.

In 1915, Pepler moved to Ditchling, where Gill had set up a commune of religious artists and artisans. There, he founded St. Dominic&#x27;s Press, with the intention of printing books “about crafts which machinery threatened with extinction.” It published, amongst other books, important editions for the Ulysses Bookshop in High Holborn, London, owned by Jacob Schwartz, to 1937. These included works of James Joyce (in fact pirate editions), but also George Bernard Shaw, John Drinkwater, Augustus John, Chesterton and John Collier.

He became a Catholic convert in 1916; and joined the Dominicans as a lay member in 1918. At that time, he changed his name to Hilary. Financial quarrels between Pepler and Gill may have led to Gill leaving the Ditchling group in 1924. Pepler was forced to leave the Guild in 1934.

After Chesterton&#x27;s death in 1936, Pepler assisted Reginald Jebb, son-in-law of Hilaire Belloc, in running &quot;The Weekly Review&quot;, the successor distributist publication to &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Stephen Dorril&#x27;s &quot;Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism&quot; (2006) mentions Pepler in passing, as a member of the British People&#x27;s Party in 1945.

==Family==
He married Clare Whiteman in 1904; they had three sons and three daughters. His son David Pepler married Betty Gill, daughter of Eric Gill. Pepler&#x27;s son, Fr. Conrad Pepler, O.P., ran the Dominican conference centre at Spode House, Staffordshire, for many years, and founded Spode Music Week.

<doc id="993449" wikidata="Q1420988" url="?curid=993449" title="Longitudinal fissure">
<text>The longitudinal fissure (or cerebral fissure, great longitudinal fissure, median longitudinal fissure, interhemispheric fissure) is the deep groove that separates the two cerebral hemispheres of the vertebrate brain. Lying within it is a continuation of the dura mater (one of the meninges) called the falx cerebri. The inner surfaces of the two hemispheres are convoluted by gyri and sulci just as is the outer surface of the brain.

== Structure ==

=== Falx cerebri ===
All three meninges of the cortex (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) fold and descend deep down into the longitudinal fissure, physically separating the two hemispheres. Falx cerebri is the name given to the dura mater in-between the two hemispheres, whose significance arises from the fact that it is the outermost layer of the meninges. These layers prevent any direct connectivity between the bilateral lobes of the cortex, thus requiring any tracts to pass through the corpus callosum. The vasculature of falx cerebri supplies blood to the innermost surfaces of the cortex, neighboring the midsagittal plane.

=== Cerebral asymmetry ===
Though this fissure divides the brain, the two hemispheres of the human cortex are not perfectly symmetrical, both in structure and in function. For example, the planum temporale, roughly corresponding to the Wernicke’s area, was found to be 10 times larger in the left than the right hemisphere. In contrast, the caudate nucleus, within the basal ganglia, was found to be larger in the right hemisphere.

=== Corpus callosum ===
The corpus callosum connects the two halves of the brain below the fissure and conveys visual, auditory, and somatosensory messages between each half. The corpus callosum is responsible for eye movement and visual perception, maintaining a balance between arousal and attention, and the ability to identify locations of sensory stimulation. In a clinical setting, those with epilepsy may benefit from the division of the corpus callosum.

== Development ==

=== Phylogenetically ===
It is thought that a majority of existing animals, including Homo sapiens, have evolved from a common wormlike ancestor that lived around 600 million years ago, called the urbilaterian. A bilaterian animal is one that has symmetrical left and right body halves. While it is still debated whether this species had a complex brain or not, development of similar species support the hypothesis that it had at least a simple anterior collection of nerve cells, called a cephalon. Furthermore, studies have shown that this cephalon was bilateral, consisting of two or more connected sub-collections that are separated by the mid-sagittal plane, suggesting the first example of such a division.

=== Ontogenetically ===
A neural crest appears in the mammalian embryo as soon as the 20th day of development. It is during embryonic development that a neural tube appears and is folded into a hollow structure, as shown in Figure 1. This process is also known as neurulation. The neural tube is where the central nervous system forms, which later on in development will be subdivided and differentiated into distinct sections of the brain and spinal cord. These subdivisions occur by signaling molecules that direct differentiated cells to their correct location of the organism. The bilateral sides of this structure then give rise to the two hemispheres of the Homo sapiens cortex but do not merge at any point besides the corpus callosum. As a result, the longitudinal fissure is formed. The longitudinal fissure can appear as early as the eighth week of development, and distinctly separates the two hemispheres by around the tenth gestational week.

== Function ==
Essentially, the fissure&#x27;s purpose is to separate the brain into two hemispheres, left and right. Through case studies of brain damage or stroke to either side of each hemisphere, there is evidence that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, and the right side controlling the left side of the body. Stroke patients have been found to unilateral impairment following damage to either the left or right hemisphere, this effecting the opposite side of the body. Separating each hemisphere allows for specialization of storage, procedural and cognitive function. Through &quot;split-brain experiments&quot;, the left hemisphere is shown to specialize in mathematics, language and general logistics. The right hemisphere is further specialized, generally, in music, art, facial recognition and in most spatial events.

The longitudinal fissure also pays a role in the optic nerve tract. This is shown in (figure 4.) with the optic chiasm, which takes the nerve from the right eye to the left hemisphere and the left eye to the right hemisphere. The longitudinal fissure allows for this misdirection and crossover of nerves. The crossover seems to be counterintuitive, however it does serve an adaptive purpose. This purpose is to give us stereopsis, (depth and three-dimensional vision), as well as a development of binocular vision. These two components combined give the ability to have a larger perceived visual field, which coincides with the hypothesis that this is an adaptive function given by the fissures placement and structure. Damage to the nerve past the optic chiasm, will cause loss or impairment to the corresponding eye. If the right side of the brain is damaged and the nerve is damaged or destroyed, then the left eye will also follow the severity of damage.

== Clinical significance ==
The longitudinal fissure plays a key role in corpus callosotomy, neurosurgery resulting in split brain, as it provides unobstructed access to the corpus callosum. Corpus callosotomy is one of the procedures used for pharmacologically treating intractable epilepsy cases, and it consists of the division of the nerve fibers running between the two hemispheres through the corpus callosum. A neurosurgeon separates the two hemispheres physically by pulling them apart with special tools, and cuts through either approximately two thirds of the fibers in the case of partial callosotomy, or the entirety in the case of complete callosotomy. Without the presence of longitudinal fissure, the corpus callosotomy procedure would be significantly more challenging and dangerous, as it would require the surgeon to navigate through densely connected cortical areas. Following the procedure, the two hemispheres are no longer able to communicate with each other as before.

While patients’ brains usually adapt and allow for uninterrupted daily life, cognitive tests can easily determine whether a patient has split-brain. In an experiment involving a chimeric figure, with a woman’s face on the left half and a man’s face on the right half, a patient with split-brain focusing on the middle point will point to the woman’s face when prompted to point to the face in the picture, and will answer “a man” if asked what the picture is depicting. This is because the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is in the right hemisphere, while language centers are predominantly in the left hemisphere.

=== Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ===
In studies, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applications have been tested with various cognitive processes during time perception tasks. Studies have analyzed the effects of the low-frequency rTMS on tests of time perception when the rTMS has been applied to the &quot;parietal medial longitudinal fissure&quot;. Findings have shown evidence to support the hypothesis that participants in this study would underestimate their perception of time for short amounts of time and overestimate for longer periods of time. Specifically, the 20 participants underestimated 1 second time intervals and overestimated 4 second/9 second intervals after applying 1-Hz rTMS.

=== Neurosurgery ===
The longitudinal fissure can serve as an effective surgical passage in the frontal bone during central and pterional craniotomies, which is opening into the skull by surgery. While there are variations in the head shapes of many species, dogs have been found to have a high variation in terms of head shapes making it difficult to find a brain surgical procedure that will work effectively for them. One goal of the study was to distinguish the longitudinal cerebral fissure anatomy and their possible variations in brachy‐(B), dolicho‐(D) and mesaticephalic‐(M) dogs. Even though the lateral cerebral fissure morphology was uniform in the dog breeds. Mesaticephalic‐(M) dogs were found to have the greatest surgical passage resulting in access to more brain structures, while the dolicho‐(D) dogs had the smallest surgical passage.

==Research==
As the corpus callosum is substantially smaller in surface area relative to the longitudinal fissure (Figure 3), fiber bundles passing through are densely packed together, and precision tracking is essential to distinguish between the individual bundles that originate from and lead to the same cortical centers. Understanding such connections allows us to understand the contralateral concurrences and what diseases can result from lesions to them. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI or dMRI) along with fiber-tracking (FT) algorithms and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is used to image these bundles. For instance, occipital-callosal fiber tracts were localized with 1–2  mm precision using DTI-TF techniques - which are very important for the cooperation of visual cortices, and any lesion to them can lead to alexia, the inability to read.

<text>Sacrobosco is an irregular lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands to the west of the Rupes Altai escarpment. It is a readily identified feature due to the three circular craters that lie on its floor. The rim of Sacrobosco is heavily worn and eroded, especially in the northeast. The floor is relatively flat in the south, except where overlain by Sacrobosco A and B, but is somewhat irregular in the northeast.

To the northwest of Sacrobosco is the double crater Abenezra and Azophi. To the east-northeast is Fermat, and to the south-southwest lies Pontanus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on Lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sacrobosco.

<text>RAF Uxbridge was a Royal Air Force (RAF) station in Uxbridge, within the London Borough of Hillingdon, occupying a site that originally belonged to the Hillingdon House estate. The British Government purchased the estate in 1915, three years before the founding of the RAF. Until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the station was open to the public.

The station is best known as the headquarters of No. 11 Group RAF, which was responsible for the aerial defence of London and the south-east of England during the Battle of Britain. Hillingdon House served as the group&#x27;s headquarters. A bunker, subsequently known as the Battle of Britain Bunker, was built nearby to house the Operations Room, which controlled fighter squadrons operating within the group. The Operations Room was also responsible for providing air support during the evacuation of Dunkirk in May 1940 (Operation Dynamo) and the D-Day landings (Operation Overlord). It was here that Winston Churchill first said, &quot;Never in the history of mankind has so much been owed by so many to so few&quot;, which he repeated in a speech to Parliament four days later.

RAF Uxbridge closed on 31 March 2010 as part of a reduction in the number of Ministry of Defence installations in the Greater London area. Many of its remaining military units were relocated to nearby RAF Northolt the following day. Plans for redevelopment, consisting of a mixture of new residential and commercial properties and the retention of all listed buildings, were approved in January 2011. A small part of the station incorporating the Battle of Britain Bunker retains the RAF Uxbridge name and is owned by Hillingdon Council.

The River Pinn runs through the site from north to south, passing Hillingdon House and the Battle of Britain Bunker. The land around the river is mainly wooded and designated as greenbelt, and Hillingdon Golf Course borders the south of the station. A footpath through the site that had closed in 1988 was reopened in 2011.

==History==

===Early years===

The area that became RAF Uxbridge was long a part of the estate of Hillingdon House, built as a hunting lodge in 1717 by the Duke of Schomberg, who staged regular hunts in the grounds. He was a German-born general serving under the future King William III, and was knighted for his part in the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.

The Marchioness of Rockingham, widow of Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, bought the house in 1786 for £9,000 () following her husband&#x27;s death and lived there until her own death in 1804. She left the estate to her stepsister Elizabeth, widow of William Weddell MP, who sold it to Josias Du Pré Porcher in 1805.

In 1810 the estate was sold to Richard Henry Cox, grandson of Richard Cox, founder of the travel company Cox &amp; Kings. Cox &amp; Co, as the company was then known, was formed after Richard Cox was appointed agent to the Foot Guards (later the Grenadier Guards), and provided banking services for many regiments of the British Army by the end of the 18th century. The mansion was completely rebuilt after it burnt down in 1844 and later received a Grade II listing as a historic site.

===First World War===
In 1914 the mansion was put on the market by the estate of Frederick Cox, Richard Henry Cox&#x27;s grandson. It was described as &quot;a brick and stone building, partly stuccoed, with extensive outbuildings and ornamental gardens&quot;. The house and gardens, together with the surrounding parkland and an artificial lake created by damming a section of the River Pinn, amounted to over .

The British Government purchased the estate in 1915, with the intention of establishing a prisoner of war camp. The local population strongly opposed the plan, causing the government to relent, and the site instead became the Canadian Convalescent Hospital to care for troops evacuated from the front line during the First World War. The hospital opened on 20 September 1915. It was joined on 19 November 1917 by the Royal Flying Corps Armament School which moved into Hillingdon House with 114 officers and 1,156 men, making a donation of £2289.12s.9d (£ in ) to the Canadian Red Cross. The RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadians, and established firing ranges for the training of recruits in ground gunnery. A total of eight of these ranges were built along the River Pinn; one remains today. The hospital closed on 12 December 1917.

On 1 April 1918, the Uxbridge site came under control of the Royal Air Force, which had been formed that day by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The following month it became the first RAF station to receive a royal visit, from King George V.

===Inter-war years===
The Recruits Training Depot and a detachment of the RAF Depot from RAF Halton arrived in August 1919, merging to form Depot, RAF Uxbridge. The station itself was designated RAF Central Depot, Uxbridge. The site was then split to form two new RAF stations, the area to the east of the River Pinn heading uphill to Hillingdon House becoming RAF Hillingdon and the remainder RAF Uxbridge. That year, the building that became the station cinema was opened, designed by Lieutenant J. G. N. Clift of the Royal Engineers, and served as a lecture hall for new recruits. 

The RAF School of Music moved to RAF Uxbridge from Hampstead in September 1919. Headquarters Southern Area, Southern Area Medical Headquarters, Southern Area Barrack Stores, and the Southern Area and South Eastern Area Headquarters of the Air Construction Service moved into Hillingdon House in October 1919. T. E. Lawrence, better known as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, underwent initial training at the Uxbridge Depot in 1922 after enlisting in the RAF under the assumed name John Hume-Ross. He recounted his experiences in &quot;The Mint&quot;.
Uxbridge Football Club was provided with the use of the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers&#x27; hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. 

Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.

Owing to its wooden construction the original Operations Room could only be used during the summer months; maintenance of the signalling and communications equipment became difficult under damp winter conditions. A memo dated 16 January 1933, sent to the senior Air Staff Officer, Wing Commander Modin, stated:
Douglas Bader arrived at the military hospital in 1932 to recover from the amputation of his legs following an air crash. During his stay Bader met the Desoutter brothers, who were beginning to make lightweight artificial legs from aluminium. Once fitted with artificial legs, Bader fought hard to regain his former abilities and in time his efforts paid off. He was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf and even dance. During his convalescence, Bader met his future wife Thelma Edwards, a waitress at The Pantiles tearooms in Bagshot 25 miles away.

Formed on 1 May 1936, Group RAF was headquartered at RAF Uxbridge under the command of Air Vice Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, who was succeeded by Sir Ernest Gossage in January 1937. The ADGB was reorganised on 13 July 1936, with control of fighter aircraft passing to the newly established RAF Fighter Command, which moved to RAF Bentley Priory. The following day the remaining elements of ADGB became RAF Bomber Command, headquartered in Hillingdon House.

Planning for the new Operations Room, within what became known as the Battle of Britain Bunker, began in August 1937. Initially it was to be buried below ground, but problems with the local London Clay on the site meant it was eventually built by Sir Robert McAlpine at a depth of , and was still able to withstand being hit by a bomb. The bunker was designed by Bob Creer of the Air Ministry. Work began in February 1939 and finished in August, ten days before the outbreak of the Second World War. The original Operations Room on the surface remained as a back-up, but was not required for that purpose and was renamed Building 76. Also in August 1939, Bomber Command moved to Iver. On 2 September the new Operations Room and RAF Uxbridge reached operational war readiness. The station closed to the public on the outbreak of war, and the football club was required to suspend its use of the stadium.

===Second World War===

During the war, RAF Uxbridge was tasked with despatching personnel to and from training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.

During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory received air threat warnings that it filtered to remove duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to Group sector airfields. Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers&#x27; hospital was converted to the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.
While overseeing the operations at RAF Uxbridge, Air Vice Marshal Park stayed in a house opposite the entrance to the bunker. He used a small door to reach the bunker from the house each day. The house, named after the war in Park&#x27;s honour, was demolished in 1996 to make way for newly constructed married quarters; only the garden wall and door were retained. Wing Commander Willoughby de Broke received the Air Force Cross on 11 July 1940 for his service as a Senior Operations Officer for Group, working within the Operations Room. 

Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited the station on 16 August 1940, to monitor the battle from the Operations Room. He subsequently made his well-known comment, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;, to General Ismay as they got into their car to leave. Churchill repeated the quote in a speech to Parliament four days later. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the station on 6 September. Churchill was again present at RAF Uxbridge on 15 September 1940, the fiercest day of fighting of the entire battle and later named Battle of Britain Day. As the last squadrons were sent into battle, Churchill asked Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park, &quot;How many reserves have we?&quot; Park answered, &quot;There are none.&quot;
A delayed-action landmine fell on the station on 26 September 1940, between the police school and WAAF Quarters where it remained until it was defused the following day. Two days later on 28 September a bomb fell into a tree from the Operations Room and was later taken to Harefield where it was defused. A Junkers Ju 88 attacked the station on 6 October 1940, dropping a bomb beside the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) grocery shop. The device damaged water and gas mains but caused no casualties. Few bombs fell on the station; Luftwaffe pilots may have mistaken the glass greenhouses at the Lowe &amp; Shawyer plant nursery west of the station for a large body of water not on their maps.

The king and queen returned on 1 November 1941, by which time a &quot;Royal Box&quot; had been installed in the Operations Room from which they could observe the plotting activities. During 1942, General Charles de Gaulle, Sir Anthony Eden and Lord Mountbatten all visited the Operations Room. The actors Rex Harrison (then a squadron leader liaising with Bomber Command), Cyril Raymond and Ronald Adam all served within the Operations Room during the war.

In 1941, a division of the Meteorological Office was established at RAF Uxbridge as part of the Intelligence Branch. On 1 July that year, the station Sick Quarters were merged with the WAAF hospital to create the RAF Station Hospital. Group was involved in providing air support for the Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942. Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory commanded participating Allied air forces from the Group Operations Room. The air operations section of Operation Overlord—the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 (D-Day)—was also controlled from RAF Uxbridge. Orders from the station were the only ones issued to Allied air units on the day. The headquarters of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th Tactical Air Force of the USAAF were stationed at Uxbridge while preparations were made for the invasion. On D-Day, the Group Controller was responsible for ensuring sufficient air patrols of the United Kingdom, the main shipping routes, and the beach landing areas.

===Post-war years===

RAF Uxbridge served as an athlete&#x27;s village for the male competitors in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Swimmers trained at nearby Uxbridge Lido, and female athletes were housed at RAF West Drayton. Personnel from RAF Uxbridge were moved out to RAF Stanmore Park and transported back to the station daily for their shifts. In 1949, the RAF Cricket Association opened on Vine Lane on the western boundary of the station. Also moving into the stations grounds in October of that year were the 14F squadron or the Air Training Corps, their access also being via Vine Lane. The station&#x27;s badge was approved in April 1953, incorporating a drill sergeant&#x27;s pace stick to symbolise the training of recruits, and a bugle to represent the Central Band of the RAF; Uxbridge was the first RAF station in Middlesex to have a badge approved.

The ceremonial entrance to the north-west of the station, St Andrew&#x27;s Gate, was officially opened on 16 December 1957 to mark the link between Uxbridge and the Royal Air Force. A memorial to the personnel of Group, made of Cornish granite, was placed in the ground above the Operations Room in 1957. Group moved to RAF Martlesham Heath on 14 April 1958 and the room was soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended by Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a flypast of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November 1958, and the station was subsequently merged with No. 22 Group RAF.

The station was granted the Freedom of the London Borough of Hillingdon on 19 March 1960, an honour allowing the station&#x27;s personnel to march throughout the borough in uniform. On 1 November that year, the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron of the RAF Regiment moved to Uxbridge and the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. After the war, the station was already home to the London Area Control Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton but remained under the parentage of RAF Uxbridge.
The Operations Room was extensively surveyed in order for a replica to be built at Pinewood Studios for the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;. Scenes for the 1996 television miniseries &quot;Over Here&quot; and an episode of Richard Holmes&#x27; &quot;War Walks&quot; were filmed in the Operations Room itself. The reinforced Uniter building was built on the site in the 1970s to house communications equipment. Although no longer used for this purpose, the building contains two fuel storage tanks. The main entrance to the station was moved in 1972 from beside the station cinema to its present location roughly south.

Over nine months in 1975, the Operations Room was restored by Signals Unit. The original map was repaired and returned to the table by the RAF Cartography unit, and the board detailing the readiness and activities of each sector squadron was rebuilt to resemble its status on 15 September 1940. In 1985 a museum was created within the bunker by Warrant Officer Robert &quot;Chris&quot; Wren and the Operations Room opened for group visits.

In January 1981, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted a bomb in the Suvla barrack block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was discovered and the thirty-five RAF musicians and fifteen airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations was reviewed. The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the Falklands War. The station went on to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 1987 by staging several events that raised £30,000 (£ in ) for the RAF Benevolent Fund.
RAF Uxbridge also became involved in Operation Granby following the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time and deployed in December that year. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station for the families of service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.

The station church, St Luke&#x27;s, became structurally unsound on 21 November 1990 after the foundations failed. The building dated back to 1933 and had been constructed of wood; the walls were pushed out and the floor rose by . In March 1993, the Leigh-Mallory bridge was opened across the River Pinn, and the church moved into a new permanent home, Building 231, in March 1995. Jim Bolger, then Prime Minister of New Zealand, visited the station in May, and in October the station&#x27;s new sports centre opened.

RAF Uxbridge personnel were once more prepared for action in the Gulf in 2003 in readiness for Operation Telic in Iraq. A support network for the families of service personnel sent into action was again established at the station. In March 2003 the Under-Secretary of State for Defence was briefed at Uxbridge as part of preparations for a visit to the Gulf.

Personnel paraded through Uxbridge town centre on 28 November 2007, exercising the freedom of the borough granted to the station in 1960. RAF Uxbridge became a satellite station of RAF Northolt on 1 April 2008, in preparation for eventual closure. In the final years of RAF ownership, the Service Prosecuting Authority and Civil Aviation Authority&#x27;s UK Airprox Board (investigating air proximity incidents) was based in Hillingdon House. The final of the national Carnegie Champions schools rugby tournament was held at the station in August 2008. The link between RAF Uxbridge and the Royal Observer Corps was renewed in 2008 with the closure of RAF Bentley Priory and the relocation to Uxbridge of ROC memorabilia from the Priory Officers&#x27; Mess for safekeeping and display (the Royal Observer Corps having been stood down from operational duties in December 1995).

The Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron returned from a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009, marked by a homecoming parade through Uxbridge town centre held on 5 August 2009. More than 20,000 people watched the parade, which started from Uxbridge Magistrates Court, passing along the town&#x27;s High Street to the RAF station.

==Closure and redevelopment==

Prior to the closure of RAF Uxbridge, Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to the station in February 2010, via her equerry, Wing Commander A. D. Calame, who had served as Officer Commanding the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron between 10 August 2005 and 16 July 2007:

The station closed on 31 March 2010 as part of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Project MoDEL, a programme to reduce the number of defence sites in Greater London in favour of a core site at RAF Northolt. The closure ceremony was overseen by the Mayor of Hillingdon and included parades and the final lowering of the Royal Air Force Ensign over the parade ground. A Supermarine Spitfire conducted a flypast of the station. The final units marched to their new station at RAF Northolt the following day. The station, which had received the Freedom of the Borough of Hillingdon, returned the award to the London Borough of Hillingdon as part of the ceremony, though this was returned on 4 September to be stored in the museum of the Battle of Britain Bunker. A commemorative blue plaque dedicated to Douglas Bader was unveiled by the Mayor of Hillingdon at the entrance to the Officers&#x27; Mess.
The Middlesex Wing Headquarters of the Air Training Corps (ATC) had been based at the station together with Squadron ATC, which met on Mondays and Thursdays for parade nights. As part of the closing ceremony, personnel of Squadron were presented with the station badge to adopt as their own. The squadron continued to meet at the station until July 2010, when a newly refurbished building at the TA Centre on Honeycroft Hill became available.

The Grade I listed Battle of Britain Bunker is now preserved as a museum open to the public, while the Grade II listed Hillingdon House will be partially converted into a restaurant. The station cinema is also Grade II listed. The Battle of Britain War Memorial is a scheduled protected monument. Although not listed, several other buildings on the site were identified within the plans for possible retention: the Sick Quarters, the Officers&#x27; Mess, the original gymnasium, the carpenters&#x27; block in the grounds of Hillingdon House and a building near the Battle of Britain Bunker. St. Andrew&#x27;s Gate will be retained, as will the Mons barrack block adjacent to the parade ground.

Plans to develop the remaining of the site were approved by the London Borough of Hillingdon in January 2011 for 1,340 homes, shops, a theatre and a primary school to be built over ten years. The council intends the development to become an extension of Uxbridge town centre. Early suggestions from the Leader of Hillingdon Council included a theatre with a statue of T.E. Lawrence outside, and a new museum built around the Battle of Britain Bunker. MP for Uxbridge John Randall called in 2009 for Hillingdon Hospital to be relocated to the site as an alternative to a planned rebuilding project on its existing site. The hospital trust ruled out such a move due to the projected costs.
The area around the Battle of Britain Bunker, including the Group memorial, will retain the RAF Uxbridge name and be maintained by RAF Northolt as an exclave. The Royal Air Force Ensign was moved to the area, together with the Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian, a fibreglass replica of aircraft BR600. The Spitfire was refurbished and painted in the D-Day invasion colours of Squadron as aircraft BS239, funded by the London Borough of Hillingdon. Uxbridge&#x27;s first gate guardian was a real Supermarine Spitfire which was unveiled on 23 May 1973. This was sold to a collector for restoration and replaced by the current guardian in 1988. At a service commemorating the Battle of Britain in September 2010, a new Hawker Hurricane gate guardian in the markings of Polish Fighter Squadron was unveiled, also near the bunker. The guardian is a fibreglass replica of the aircraft flown by Witold Urbanowicz during the Battle of Britain.

The South Hillingdon branch of the St. John Ambulance service was based at RAF Uxbridge until the closure in 2010 led to a period of uncertainty over its relocation. Eventually, RAF Northolt provided the charity with new premises, which were available from January 2011.

In June 2011, it was announced that the public right of way from St Andrew&#x27;s Gate in the north-west to Vine Lane in the north-east would be reopened, after work to fence off the pathway was completed. The path, long, was the subject of a petition submitted to Hillingdon Council in 2010 and had been closed since 1988. The path was reopened in early August 2011.

Since closing, the site has been used extensively for filming. Most recently, scenes for the television drama &quot;Endeavour&quot;, set in the 1960s, were filmed there.
In April 2012, VSM Estates announced it would be completing the purchase of the site from the MoD, with a view to commencing building work by the end of the year. VSM were provided with a £60 million five-year loan by HSBC, together with funding from joint parent companies, St. Modwen Properties and Vinci plc. Persimmon will develop of the site with 500 homes under an existing joint venture agreement with St Modwen. Demolition of the site in phases began in October 2012. The site will be developed under the St Andrew&#x27;s Park name.

A wood commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II was planted within the site in May 2012. Each school in the London Borough of Hillingdon was invited to plant a tree, and the Station Commander of RAF Northolt, Group Captain Tim O&#x27;Brien, also planted one on behalf of the RAF. The wood was officially dedicated by the London Borough of Hillingdon&#x27;s Representative Deputy Lieutenant, Wing Commander Edna Partridge, on 19 July 2012.

A ground-breaking ceremony was held on 2 July 2013 on the site, attended by the Mayor of Hillingdon and cabinet members of Hillingdon Council. The development is due to be completed within seven years.

A new primary school, built on the site of the former sports ground and gym, opened in September 2014. Named the John Locke Academy, the school will have 630 primary places and 90 nursery places when fully subscribed.

An additional planning application for the construction of office buildings was submitted by St. Modwen in June 2015.

<text>Lucius Shepard (August 21, 1943 – March 18, 2014) was an American writer. Classified as a science fiction and fantasy writer, he often leaned into other genres, such as magical realism.

==Career==
Shepard was a native of Lynchburg, Virginia, where he was born in 1943. His first short stories appeared in 1983, and his first novel, &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, appeared in 1984. At the time, he was considered part of the cyberpunk movement. Shepard came to writing late, having first enjoyed a varied career, including a stint playing rock and roll in the Midwest and extensive travel throughout Europe and Asia. Algis Budrys, reviewing &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, praised Shepard&#x27;s &quot;ease of narrative style that comes only from a profound love and respect for the language and the literatures that have graced it.&quot;

Lucius Shepard won several awards for his science fiction: in 1985 he won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, followed in 1987 with a Nebula Award for Best Novella for his story &quot;R&amp;R&quot;. This story later became part of his 1987 novel &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, which won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis in 1990. His novella &quot;Barnacle Bill the Spacer&quot; won a Hugo Award in 1993. His poem &quot;White Trains&quot; won the Rhysling Award in 1988. Two early collections of short stories won the World Fantasy Award for best collection: &quot;The Jaguar Hunter&quot; in 1988 and &quot;The Ends of the Earth Collection&quot; in 1992. His novella &quot;Vacancy&quot; won a Shirley Jackson Award in 2008.

Lucius Shepard resided in Portland, Oregon.

==Themes and evolution==

Shepard embraced many different themes throughout his career. In his early work, he wrote extensively about Central America. This included clearly science-fictional stories about near future high-tech jungle war (such as &quot;R&amp;R&quot; and &quot;Salvador&quot;), as well as stories that seemed more in line with magic realism. Many of these, such as &quot;Black Coral&quot; (which concerns an American living on an island off of Honduras) and &quot;The Jaguar Hunter&quot; (the story of a man whose wife&#x27;s debt forces him to hunt a mythical black jaguar, which his people consider sacred), explore cultural clashes. Shepard traveled extensively in Central America and lived there for a time.

Shepard stopped writing fiction for much of the 1990s. He returned near the end of that decade, producing such works as the novella &quot;Radiant Green Star&quot;, which won a Locus Award for Best Novella in 2001. Though he still wrote Central American fiction, Shepard&#x27;s interest seemed to be moving north: he published two short novels, &quot;A Handbook of American Prayer&quot; and &quot;Viator&quot;, both set in North America. On that same note, he published many works where culture and geography were secondary (his novella &quot;Jailwise&quot; is a prime example), preferring to focus on wider questions such as the role of justice in society.

Much of Shepard&#x27;s later work was nonfiction. He researched the Freight Train Riders of America and spent time riding the rails, writing both fiction and nonfiction based on those experiences. He was also a regular movie reviewer for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; and electricstory.com. His reviews are marked by general contempt for the current state of American film.

According to fellow author James Patrick Kelly, Shepard was an avid sports fan who often used dramatic sports moments as inspiration to write.

In the summer of 2008, Shepard moved to Neuchatel, Switzerland in order to work on several screenplays. He served on the jury of the Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival (NIFFF) with the American director Joe Dante.

He died in March 2014 at the age of 70 of complications from a stroke.

<text>Snellius is a lunar impact crater located near the southeast limb of the Moon.

The rim of Snellius is heavily worn and eroded, with overlapping craterlets. The floor is somewhat irregular and uneven. The western rim marks the start of the Vallis Snellius, one of the longest valleys on the Moon. It continues nearly 500 kilometers to the northwest to near the edge of Mare Nectaris. Its origin is most likely associated with the formation of the lunar mare.

To the northeast is the large crater Petavius. South of Snellius is the crater Stevinus. Just to the northwest is Snellius A, a crater with a notable ray system that overlaps the southwest reaches of Mare Fecunditatis to the north.

It is named after Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist, Willebrord Snellius.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Snellius.

<text>Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion was a surrealist magazine published in Chicago and edited by Franklin Rosemont. It appeared infrequently between 1970 and 1989. Apart from Rosemont, the editor in chief, the magazine&#x27;s editorial board included other members of the Chicago Surrealist group (such as Paul Garon, Joseph Jablonski, Philip Lamantia and Penelope Rosemont). The first issue of the magazine was published in October 1970. Four issues have appeared, the second in 1973, the third in 1976 and the fourth and most recent in 1989. The publisher of all four issues was Black Swan Press.

Contributors to Number 3 included Jayne Cortez and Philip Lamantia, a surrealist poet connected to the Beats. It was described as &quot;[a] stunning, lavish, damn huge production, with essays, art, poetry and invective from just about anyone who&#x27;s anyone... [a]ngry, uncompromising and provocative&quot;, with &quot;[m]ind blowing perspectives on just about everything.&quot;

Number 4 included work by Georges Bataille, Benjamin Paul Blood, André Breton, Luis Buñuel, Leonora Carrington, Karl Marx, George Orwell, Benjamin Péret and others.

<text>West Coast Railways (WCR) is a railway spot-hire company and charter train operator based at Carnforth MPD in Lancashire. Using buildings and other facilities previously owned by the Steamtown Carnforth visitor attraction, in June 1998 the company became the first privately owned company to be given a licence as a train operating company.

==History==

===Before 1998===

After British Rail closed the Lakeside branch to passengers on 6 September 1965, a group of enthusiasts chaired by Dr. Peter Beet formed the Lakeside Railway Estates Company, with the idea of preserving both the line and Carnforth MPD, to provide a complete steam operating system. After agreeing to rent out part of the Carnforth MPD site, but with the counter the development of the A590 road meaning that the complete vision was unsuccessful, Beet developed the visitor attraction Steamtown Carnforth, which became a mecca for steam enthusiasts from 1967.

In 1974, Sir Bill McAlpine became a shareholder in the company, with his 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; making Carnforth its home. McAlpine subsequently acquired a controlling interest in the company, in order to fund the purchase of the complete site including the track from British Rail.

In light of McAlpine&#x27;s declining interest, in 1990 his controlling interest in Steamtown Railway Museum was sold to David Smith, who over the following years has bought out most of the minority shareholders. With increasing Health &amp; Safety Executive regulations, and an increased reliance on revenue from supplying and servicing steam locomotives to power enthusiast trains, the commercial decision was taken not to reopen Carnforth as a museum or visitor attraction for the 1998 season. Steamtown Railway Museum still exists today as the holding company, and operates an extensive railway repair and operating facility on the site.

===After 1998===
In June 1998, West Coast Railway Company was granted an operating licence to become a train operating company. WCR is a spot hire company which provides locomotives, stock and crews to other companies within the rail industry. The company operates charter trains, some of which are hauled by steam locomotives. The company provides stock and crews for steam workings on the national network, and for diesel tours. The headquarters, engineering base and depot are at Carnforth, where locomotives and stock are stored and maintained, and where contract work is undertaken for other operators.

WCR own and operated steam locomotive 5972 &quot;Olton Hall&quot; under the guise of &quot;Hogwarts Castle&quot; for the Harry Potter film series, with the &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot;.

====March 2015 incident and operating licence suspension====

On 7 March 2015, the 16:35 east bound &quot;Cathedrals Express&quot; operated by WCR (Bristol Temple Meads to Southend East) approaching from Chippenham, headed by Battle of Britain class No. 34067 &quot;Tangmere&quot; and 13 coaches passed signal SN45 at danger at Wootton Bassett Junction on the Great Western Main Line, overrunning the signal by and coming to a stand blocking the junction. This occurred less than a minute after the up/east bound First Great Western (FGW) service from Swansea to London Paddington passenger service approaching via the South Wales Main Line from Badminton, Gloucestershire and operated by an InterCity 125 set, had cleared the junction at . The signal was being maintained at danger to ensure the safety of the FGW train after it had passed through the junction, as is signalling practice.

The incident was investigated by track owner Network Rail (NR), the Office of Rail Regulation and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB). The RAIB launched an investigation into the incident on 27 March, releasing a statement in which they described the incident as a &quot;dangerous occurrence&quot;. According to the RAIB, the incident was caused by driver error, after the traincrew isolated the Automatic Warning System and Train Protection &amp; Warning System on approach to a temporary speed restriction in the area of line immediately after signal SN43, the signal before signal SN45. These were not reinstated on approach to signal SN45; as a result, the train was not automatically stopped by the safety systems as it passed the signal at danger. down the line, the train was manually brought to a stop by the driver; it came to a rest across Wootton Bassett Junction.

WCR and NR met on 30 March 2015. NR subsequently expressed the view that at that meeting &quot;WCR demonstrated that its controls, communication and commitment following the recent SPAD were inadequate&quot; and that since then &quot;the response by the senior management of WCR to the issues raised&quot; had been &quot;inadequate&quot;, suspending WCR&#x27;s operator&#x27;s licence effective from midnight 3 April 2015. Previously operators had been banned from certain routes, but this was a total network ban unprecedented since privatisation. The suspension notice states:
WCR stated that it was in negotiations with NR regarding the terms of the suspension, and also with other train operating companies in order to prevent the cancellation of many scheduled WCR operated railtours during the period of suspension.

On 8 May 2015, Network Rail lifted the track access ban off the company. This meant that the company could continue its scheduled tours for the coming months including the first of the Jacobite railtours.
On 9 December 2015, the Office of Rail &amp; Road (ORR) announced that the WCR and the driver of the train involved in the incident at Wootton Bassett were to be prosecuted for offences contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. An initial hearing was scheduled at Swindon Magistrates Court for 11 January 2016. The case came to trial at Swindon Crown Court on 27 June 2016. WCR and driver Melvyn Cox both pleaded guilty. WCR was fined £200,000 and £64,000 costs. Cox was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for eighteen months. He was also ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work.

====June 2015====
On 13 June 2015 it was reported that a service had moved forward at Reading at the same time as the doors were open. This was attributed to a miscommunication between the guard and the driver.

====August 2015====
On 19 August 2015 it was reported that the company had no systems in place for keeping drivers updated with route changes, instead getting updates from other operators, and no system for managing driver training.

====September 2015====
On 5 September 2015 it was reported that a service had hit the buffer at Weymouth. This was not reported to the ORR, contrary to RIDDOR rules.

On 15 September 2015 it was reported that risk assessments for steam operation were outdated, and staff were unaware of them.

====October 2015====
On 2 October 2015 it was reported that a service had an unauthorised TPWS activation at Doncaster signal 264 at Hexthorpe Junction, between Doncaster and Conisbrough, whilst a locomotive and support coach was reversing.

====November 2015====
On 24 November 2015 it was reported that the ORR had temporarily prohibited WCR from operating steam trains on the mainline rail network, following an initial investigation into an incident near Doncaster on 2 October 2015 when 45231 &quot;The Sherwood Forester&quot; was hauling a WCR &#x27;Spirit of the Lakes&#x27; charter train and the footplate crew of the engine had isolated the Train Protection &amp; Warning System equipment which would have applied the emergency brake if the driver made a safety critical error.

On 26 November 2015 it was reported that a service had moved at Bath Spa, approximately 1 meter, with the doors open and passengers boarding.

====December 2015====
On 1 December 2015 it was reported that an Improvement Notice was served on WCR following an inspection at Southall Railway Depot, due to issues around managing health and safety risks.

====February 2016 Prohibition Notice====
On 17 February 2016 the ORR issued a Prohibition Notice to WCR preventing it running its heritage rail services on the mainline railway. The notice related to concerns about WCR&#x27;s management of safety, following a number of incidents over the past year.

Under the terms of the notice, the company was not able to operate trains on the mainline network until the ORR was satisfied its governance and operations meet industry practice. Steps the company were required to take included: the introduction of clearer governance structures with proper accountability for safety; more robust risk assessments; and enhanced processes for managing staff with a focus on safety culture. Ian Prosser, HM Chief Inspector of Railways at ORR, said the decision to revoke the company&#x27;s safety certificate had &quot;not been taken lightly&quot;.

On 23 March 2016 the track access ban was lifted.

On 25 September 2018, the ORR, after extensive review and consultation with other affected parties, renewed West Coast Railway safety certificate for a period of five years.

====June 2023====

On 9 June 2023, a safety inspector attended the Jacobite service and found issues which were considered a breach of Health and Safety. A prohibition notice was issued, coming into effect on 15 June 2023, preventing West Coast Railways from running the Jacobite until the issues discovered were rectified. Service was resumed on 21 August 2023.

====January 2024 Exemption Revoked====
In January 2024, The Office of Road and Rail issued West Coast Railways with a certificate of revocation for the exemption of its hinged door rolling stock with immediate effect from 11 January (the exemption was originally intended to expire on 29 February). Following the revocation of their exemption to run hinged door rolling stock until the end of February, West Coast Railways issued a statement: “We are extremely disappointed by this decision. We remain committed to working with the ORR to agree how we can safeguard the future of our heritage services. We are already considering a range of options and have asked the ORR to allow the current exemption to run its course, to give us time to put forward detailed proposals.&quot;

====March 2024 New Request Sent====
In March 2024, WCR Announced that due to the ongoing issues with their coaches all &quot;Jacobite&quot; services which were due to start on 28 March were to be suspended until further notice. A new exemption request was submitted to the ORR on 8 March to allow the use of their MK1 and MK2 coaches for their 2024 railtour season alongside 2024&#x27;s &quot;Jacobite&quot; services. In April 2024, it was confirmed that the deliberation for a new exemption request would take four months.

==Services==
===Jacobite===
WCR operates several regular steam-hauled excursions every summer. The most famous of these trains is &quot;The Jacobite&quot; (named for the historic Jacobite political movement). It runs along the West Highland Line from Fort William to Mallaig, crossing Glenfinnan Viaduct. It runs Monday to Fridays from the middle of May until the end of October and also runs at weekends from the end of June until the end of August.

In 2011, WCR added a second &quot;Jacobite&quot; service, leaving Fort William in the afternoons from the start of June until the end of August running on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. 2012 saw this second service increase to five days a week, between June and August. In July 2023, all services were suspended following an inspection by the ORR. The morning services resumed on 9 August and the afternoon services restarted on 18 August.

In January 2024, WCR announced that discussions were being made regarding the viability of running a third &quot;Jacobite&quot; service. This service would however only run from Fort William to Arisaig, departure was set to be at 17:43 and arrive at 19:43 (a half hour long break at Glenfinnan is to be included). The return arrival at Fort William was provisionally going to be 21:18, this idea was later abandoned. In March 2024, WCR Announced that due to the ongoing issues with their coaches all &quot;Jacobite&quot; services which were supposed to start on 28 March were to be suspended until further notice. In April 2024, WCR announced that the ongoing deliberation between WCR and the ORR for a new exemption on central door locking is expected to take four months and that should their exemption request be rejected, &quot;Jacobite&quot; services would not be run for 2024. 

The morning &quot;Jacobite&quot; services restarted on 15 April 2024 but at a shorter length and a reduced capacity. As of May 2024, the afternoon &quot;Jacobite&quot; services are yet to restart.

===Scarborough Spa Express===
In July 2002, WCR began to operate the steam-hauled &quot;Scarborough Spa Express&quot; operated from York to Scarborough three times a week between July and September. After a steam ban on the eastern region in 2014 which resulted in the season being axed a restricted season ran for 2015 over three days in October. This was once again put into place for three days in October 2016; the tour was also renamed &quot;The Scarborough Flyer&quot; for the 2016 season.

The tour originally ran from York to Scarborough travelling via Normanton and Wakefield Westgate with steam haulage throughout. From 2016 the tour ran once a week from Carnforth to Scarborough traveling via Hellifield and Leeds with steam haulage only between York and Scarborough. From 2023 the tour now follows the same routing from 2016 but now runs with steam haulage throughout.

===Cambrian===

In 2007, West Coast Railways took over operation of the &quot;Cambrian Coast Express&quot; running over the Cambrian Line from Machynlleth to Porthmadog and Pwllheli and renamed it &quot;The Cambrian&quot;. The service ran from the last week of July until the end of August between 2007 and 2010. Before the 2011 season, WCR issued a statement stating that due to Network Rail&#x27;s implementation of the new European Train Control System (ETCS) signalling on the Cambrian Coast, which necessitated new in-cab signalling equipment, the seasonal steam services had to cease running because there isn&#x27;t yet a system available for fitment in steam locomotives.

===Dalesman &amp; Pendle Dalesman===

In 2014, &quot;The Dalesman&quot; was brought back after a few years absence. The tour started at York and travelled to Carlisle via Normanton, Wakefield, Leeds, Keighley, Skipton, Hellifield and the Settle &amp; Carlisle line. The tour was diesel-hauled from York to Hellifield where steam traction took over the train and travelled along the Settle and Carlisle line to Carlisle and then back to Hellifield. It had been planned to run only on Thursdays for 2016 but due to a landslip north of Appleby on the Settle and Carlisle line, &quot;The Dalesman&quot; did not run again until 2017 when the line re-opened.

In 2016, to replace &quot;The Dalesman&quot; season, a new set of tours of &quot;The Scarborough Spa Express&quot; were run from Carnforth to Scarborough with steam haulage being between York and Scarborough. Alternating each week the tour would for one week run from Carnforth to York via Hellifield and Keighley and then the following week would run via Preston, Blackburn and Brighouse. As of 2020 these trips are still running in place of the original Scarborough Spa Express trains; the tours start off diesel worked from Carnforth with a steam loco taking over in York.
Following the transfer of &quot;The Fellsman&quot; to &quot;Saphos Trains&quot; and operation changed to Locomotive Services Limited after the 2018 season, WCR used the path formerly used for &quot;Fellsman&quot; trains and re-branded it as &quot;The Pendle Dalesman&quot;. The routing and pickups remain the same, but the pickup at Long Preston has now been dropped.

===Other Operations===
From 2009 until 2018, West Coast Railways provided motive power and coaches for &quot;The Fellsman&quot; which was run by &quot;Statesman Rail&quot;, the tour started in and ran to traveling via the Settle and Carlisle Line. Pickups for the tour included Preston, Bamber Bridge (until 2011), , and .

In June 2018, West Coast Railways ran a service on the Windermere branch line between Oxenholme and Windermere after Arriva Rail North cancelled all trains on the line in the short term in an attempt to fix the disruption and cancellations around their network.

==Train Operating Company==
Former companies operated with:
* Vintage Trains (WCR unable to provide crews for tours from start of 2018, trains now operated by Vintage Trains CBS)
* Belmond Royal Scotsman (Contracted ended April 2016 by owners due to running issues with WCR and awarded to GB Railfreight)

==Routes==
Routes commonly operated over by WCR include the nearby Cumbrian Coast line, Furness line, Little North Western Line, Settle &amp; Carlisle line, and the West Highland Line. The company utilises several sidings at Hellifield, south of Settle Junction, where the lines to and diverge, allowing easy access to the WCR home base.

==Depots==
The headquarters and main depot is at Carnforth MPD. The former LMS depot coded 10A has workshops for steam and diesel locomotives, and also carriage and wagon facilities to maintain the company&#x27;s fleet of Mark 1 and Mark 2 carriages. The site includes extensive sidings plus a paint shop.

The company&#x27;s second base is the former Great Western Railway depot at Southall Railway Centre in West London which it has occupied since 2008. &quot;The Green Train&quot; is based here, used on &quot;The Cathedrals Express&quot;.

For half of the year the company also uses part of Fort William depot as a base for the stock and locomotives for its &quot;Jacobite&quot; service. The Transport for Wales depot at Machynlleth has also been used previously for the Cambrian trains, but due to the line having the new ETCS system fitted which presently isn&#x27;t compatible with steam locos the services had to cease.

==Rolling stock==

The company owns and operates a fleet of diesel locomotives, which are primarily used to haul charter trains, but have also been hired to other railway operators. The fleet is mainly composed of Class 37 and Class 47 locomotives, but also includes Class 57 locomotives, including the prototype passenger locomotive 57601.

Several Class 37 locomotives were purchased from Ian Riley Engineering, which ceased its spot-hire operations in mid-2004. In 2005, WCR won the contract to haul &quot;The Royal Scotsman&quot; luxury train. As a result, its two operational Class 37 locomotives and a Class 47 were repainted into a revised maroon livery, officially known as Royal Scotsman Claret, based on that of the Royal Scotsman carriages. In late 2005, WCR sold its two operational Class 37 locomotives (nos. 37197 and 37261) to Direct Rail Services, and received four Class 33 locomotives in exchange. As of 2011, WCR started investing in more Class 57 locomotives, bought from Advenza Freight, Harry Needle Railroad Company, Freightliner and Porterbrook.

The company&#x27;s coaching stock consists of vacuum and air plus dual braked Mark 1 and Mark 2 coaches, mostly painted in the British Railways maroon livery, albeit with West Coast Railways branding on the bodyside. Some of these coaches were built as British Railways Pullman coaches. Until January 2024 the company&#x27;s hinged door coaches were locked and unlocked from a simple sliding bolt by one of the train stewards for each coach. West Coast Railways had previously applied for an exemption which was intended to expire on 29 February 2024, however the Office of Road and Rail revoked the exemption with immediate effect from 11 January 2024. Each of the company&#x27;s coaches which are now operated on the mainline for either steam or diesel railtours now need to be fitted with Central Door Locks operated by a member of staff. With the company needing to supply dual braked Mark 1 and Mark 2 coaches for the full programme of railtours for 2024, West Coast Railways submitted a new exemption application to the ORR in March 2024 to allow the busy summer programme to run as normal for themselves alongside other railtour companys.

==Fleet details==
===Steam locomotives===
Locomotives listed here are not owned by WCR, but are made available to operate on the mainline by their respective owners (assuming they have the appropriate mainline certification).

Some engines may not now be operated on the mainline because their mainline or boiler ticket has expired or may be on display away from the national network. 5972 &quot;Olton Hall&quot; was on a 2-year loan agreement from November 2014 to the Warner Bros Studio Tour in Leavesden for their Harry Potter tour.

===Modern Traction===
All locomotives below are owned and operated by West Coast Railways.

====Diesel locomotives====
Note: Marked names indicate that the loco is not presently wearing them.

<text>Brodmann area 4 refers to the primary motor cortex of the human brain. It is located in the posterior portion of the frontal lobe.

Brodmann area 4 is part of the precentral gyrus. The borders of this area are: the precentral sulcus in front (anteriorly), the medial longitudinal fissure at the top (medially), the central sulcus in back (posteriorly), and the lateral sulcus along the bottom (laterally). 

This area of cortex, as shown by Wilder Penfield and others, has the pattern of a homunculus. That is, the legs and trunk fold over the midline; the arms and hands are along the middle of the area shown here; and the face is near the bottom of the figure. Because Brodmann area 4 is in the same general location as primary motor cortex, the homunculus here is called the motor homunculus.

The term area 4 of Brodmann-1909 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon. It is located predominantly in the precentral gyrus. Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the human gigantopyramidal area 4 and noted that it occupies a much greater fraction of the frontal lobe in the monkey than in the human.

Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is unusually thick; the layers are not distinct; the cells are relatively sparsely distributed; giant pyramidal (Betz) cells are present in the internal pyramidal layer (V); lack of an internal granular layer (IV) such that the boundary between the external pyramidal layer (III) and the internal pyramidal layer (V) is indistinct; lack of a distinct external granular layer (II); a gradual transition from the multiform layer (VI) to the subcortical white matter.

<doc id="993488" wikidata="Q7500540" url="?curid=993488" title="Shooters Island">
<text>Shooters Island is a uninhabited island at the southern end of Newark Bay, off the North Shore of Staten Island in New York City. The boundary between the modern states of New York and New Jersey runs through the island, with a small portion on the north end of the island belonging to the nearby cities of Bayonne and Elizabeth in New Jersey and the rest since 1898, as a part of the borough of Staten Island in New York City of New York state.

In colonial era times Shooters Island was used as a hunting preserve for colonists of nearby Province of New Jersey and New York Province and New York Town across the bays / harbors. During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), Commanding General George Washington and his Continental Army used the island as a drop-off point for messages, and the place became a suitable isolated haven for spies.

Following the war, the island&#x27;s large oyster beds were heavily harvested, ultimately exhausted from over harvesting by the 19th century.

==Shipyard==


The first shipyard on Shooters Island by Newark Bay and Staten Island on the west shore of Upper New York Bay was established in 1860 by David Decker. From 1898 until 1910, the island was home to a major shipyard, the Townsend-Downey Shipbuilding Company. Theodore E. Ferris (1872-1953), who later was a prominent maritime architect designed ships used by the American government in the First World War (1914/1917-1918), was an employee of the firm. By 1903, the island site was acquired by the Tidewater Oil Company founded 1887 by E. W. Marland for the next decade, Around this time it was also home to the later Standard Shipbuilding Company (both firms later subsidiaries of the huge conglomerate Standard Oil Company and its Rockefeller family interests. Standard which bought the entire island in 1915, the year after the Great War began in Europe, anticipating future American military and shipping needs with access and expansion space alongside the New York Bay and bustling major port of New York on the East Coast of the United States. The entire island by the late 19th century was occupied by buildings, industrial facilities, shops, docks, including a foundry, pattern shop, and offices. There were major docks, piers and shipways that faced to the east and Upper New York Bay / New York Harbor..

The Townsend-Downey Company had earlier built a famous royal yacht, &quot;Meteor&quot;, for Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire (Germany). Its launch in February 1902 was attended by many hundreds of spectators, including 26th President Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919, served 1901-1909), and his guests Prince Heinrich (Henry) of Prussia (1862-1929, younger brother of Kaiser Wilhelm II). The President&#x27;s eldest 18-year old daughter Alice Roosevelt (1884-1980), christened the boat for the German Emperor and Prince Heinrich of the House of Hohenzollern royal dynasty in Prussia and Imperial Germany. Famous scientist / inventor Thomas A. Edison (1847-1931), sent a motion pictures cameraman who made one of the first newsreel news recording movies / film of the event. It is available online / internet from the archived collections of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. The next day a reception was held at the White House in Washington for Mr. Downey, owner of the shipbuilding yard and representatives of the Imperial German Government.

The following year the fast three-masted schooner was also built and launched at the yard. The following year in 1905, it raced across the Atlantic Ocean and won the Kaiser&#x27;s Cup with the winning prize and set a speed record for the crossing under sail which stood unbroken for almost 90 more years. The brigantine yacht was built for the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. for use in scientific 
/ geographic magnetic surveys in the Pacific Ocean. Constructed entirely of wood and nonferrous metals so as not to interfere with taking the magnetic measurements, she was named after the Institution&#x27;s founder / endowed of the famous steel industrialist and wealthy philanthropist Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New York City, who also was a friend of shipbuilder Mr. Downey.

The island came under the later control in November 1903 of the Tidewater Oil Company, founded in 1887 by lawyer, businessman and politician E. W. (Ernest Whitworth) Marland (1874-1941) of Pennsylvania and later Oklahoma. It later became a subsidiary after 1911 of the huge dominant Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, one of the several smaller firms remaining of the former oldest and larger Standard Oil Company and its later subsidiary Standard Oil Company of Ohio (a.k.a. the oil trust / monopoly) after being broken up. It was founded in 1870 by wealthy and famous industrial titan John D. Rockefeller, (1839-1937). Two years later in 1905, the eight buildings of the plant and its surrounding industrial complex of 33 acres were purchased by the Colonial Trust Company of New York City (now merged into the Trust Company of America) for $516,000. At the time, the shipyard was valued at two million dollars.

The island was used for continued industrial and shipbuilding operations through to 1922. Abandoned, scuttled and broken vessels began to accumulate around the perimeter of the island in Newark Bay, near Staten Island by the following decade in 1930.

==Bird sanctuary==
Shooters Island began to support nesting wading birds, cormorants and gulls in the early 1970s. At its peak in 1995, the island supported 400 nesting pairs of herons, egrets, ibis and 121 nesting pairs of double-crested cormorants. The island is now owned by the City of New York and is maintained by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a bird sanctuary. 

The island and decayed remnants of old piers are visible to users of the Bayonne Bridge between Staten Island and Bayonne, New Jersey.

<doc id="993492" wikidata="Q981008" url="?curid=993492" title="Sociology of scientific knowledge">
<text>The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) is the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing with &quot;the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity.&quot; The sociology of scientific ignorance (SSI) is complementary to the sociology of scientific knowledge. For comparison, the sociology of knowledge studies the impact of human knowledge and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises.

Sociologists of scientific knowledge study the development of a scientific field and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of political, historical, cultural or economic factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote relativism or to attack the scientific project; the objective of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances.

The field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at Cornell University). Major theorists include Barry Barnes, David Bloor, Sal Restivo, Randall Collins, Gaston Bachelard, Harry Collins, Karin Knorr Cetina, Paul Feyerabend, Steve Fuller, Martin Kusch, Bruno Latour, Mike Mulkay, Derek J. de Solla Price, Lucy Suchman and Anselm Strauss.

==Programmes and schools==
The sociology of scientific knowledge in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American Robert K. Merton, generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science. Merton&#x27;s was a kind of &quot;sociology of scientists,&quot; which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Ludwik Fleck, Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the late Wittgenstein. David Bloor, one of SSK&#x27;s early champions, has contrasted the so-called &#x27;weak programme&#x27; (or &#x27;program&#x27;—either spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the &#x27;strong programme&#x27;, which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs.

The &quot;weak&quot; programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite sociological factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. Imre Lakatos and (in some moods) Thomas S. Kuhn might be said to adhere to it. The &quot;strong&quot; programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the &#x27;Edinburgh School&#x27; (David Bloor, Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh) in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, and the &#x27;Bath School&#x27; (Harry Collins and others at the University of Bath) in the same period. &quot;Edinburgh sociologists&quot; and &quot;Bath sociologists&quot; promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with Michael Mulkay at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK&#x27;s relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore).

The sociology of scientific knowledge has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Latin America. It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics.

==The sociology of mathematical knowledge==
Studies of mathematical practice and quasi-empiricism in mathematics are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge since they focus on the community of those who practice mathematics. Since Eugene Wigner raised the issue in 1960 and Hilary Putnam made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as physics and mathematics should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number-proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is more than merely modeling of reality and the objective basis is upon observational demonstration. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as &#x27;mathematics&#x27; and &#x27;physics&#x27; is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish.

Fundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by Sal Restivo and David Bloor. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as Oswald Spengler (&quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, 1918), Raymond Louis Wilder and Leslie Alvin White, as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. David Bloor draws upon Ludwig Wittgenstein and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently Paul Ernest has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists.

==Criticism==
SSK has received criticism from theorists of the actor-network theory (ANT) school of science and technology studies. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological reductionism and a human centered universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article titled &quot;Epistemological Chicken&quot;.

<doc id="993494" wikidata="Q881372" url="?curid=993494" title="Blancanus (crater)">
<text>Blancanus is a lunar impact crater located in the rugged southern region of the Moon, to the southwest of the walled plain Clavius. To the northwest lies the comparably sized crater Scheiner, and south-southwest of Blancanus is the worn Klaproth.

The outer rim of Blancanus is considerably less worn than that of Scheiner crater to the northwest, and the edge is still fairly well defined and it has a d structure on the interior. The floor is relatively flat with several low rises at the midpoint. There is a cluster of small craterlets in the southern part of the crater floor.

Crater Blancanus is named after the Jesuit astronomer and natural philosopher, Giuseppe Biancani (1566–1624).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Blancanus.

<text>It&#x27;s a Knockout! is a British game show first broadcast in 1966. It was adapted from the French show &quot;Intervilles&quot;, and was part of the international &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; franchise.

==History==
The series was broadcast on BBC1 from 7 August 1966 to 30 July 1982; thereafter a number of specials were broadcast until 25 December 1988. An episode was made by TVS for ITV which aired on 28 May 1990 as part of its ITV Telethon that year with Bernie Clifton as the host.

===Welsh version===
A Welsh version, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Games without Frontiers&quot;), was broadcast from 3 August 1991 to 24 December 1994 on S4C. It had Welsh teams battling against European contestants dressed in pink colours. Nia Chiswell and Iestyn Garlick presented. Locations included Bodelwyddan Castle, with Nia dressed as Alice in Wonderland. The series won a BAFTA Cymru award in 1994.

The series was later re-dubbed into English by Stuart Hall and broadcast on The Family Channel, from 1993 to 1994.

===Channel 5 version===
In April 1999, Channel 5 bought the rights to the show, and started filming on 15 August in Reading, Berkshire with new presenters Keith Chegwin and Lucy Alexander, alongside referee Frank Bruno and scorekeeper Nell McAndrew.

The series returned from 3 September 1999 to 6 January 2001 for two series, produced by Richard Hearsey and Ronin Entertainment, and used consultants and games from the French production. It was developed for Channel 5 with Alan Nixon, and the first show featured Stuart Hall tied up with rope in his garage wishing the new presenters well with the series. As in the previous versions, the theme tune was &quot;Bean Bag&quot; by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.

On 20 April 2001, it was announced that a third series would not be produced and that it would be replaced by two new challenge game shows, &quot;The Desert Forges&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot;.

==Format==
Teams representing a town or city complete tasks in absurd games, often dressed in large foam rubber suits. Games were played in the home town&#x27;s park, with weather often turning grassland into mud. The team scoring most points would advance to the next stage. Teams could double points in one round by choosing to &quot;play their Joker&quot;. The games were originally refereed by rugby league commentator Eddie Waring and later by former international football referee Arthur Ellis from 1969 to 1982.

===The games===
The games were described as school sports day for adults. For example, teams would carry buckets of water over greasy poles or rolling logs. Other teams would interfere, squirting water cannon or throwing custard pies. Limited budgets meant games were often a variation on what could be done with a long piece of elastic, a lot of water, a portable swimming pool and a roundabout.

In its earliest form, the show emphasised skill or organisation applied in a bizarre way, for instance picking up eggs with an industrial excavator, as well as traditional village sports such as climbing a greasy pole. Games of strength were included, for example, carrying a Mini Moke without wheels. From the beginning, a &quot;mini-marathon&quot; would run the length of the programme, with updates on progress between shorter contests. The shift to spectacular displays, with or without costumes, came later, to improve audience appeal and to follow continental traditions.

A recurring event in early episodes was &quot;piano smashing&quot; where the teams had to break up an old upright piano with sledgehammers into small enough pieces to push through an aperture shaped like a large letterbox. The event drew regular complaints from viewers who did not like to see pianos end in this way. The complaints eventually drove the managing director of BBC Television Huw Weldon to have the event withdrawn.

The winning team in each event scored three points, the second-place finisher scored two, and the third-place team scored one. Each team was given a joker card, which they could play before any one event to double the points they scored for it.

The winner of each edition was awarded an &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot; trophy and a chance to represent the UK in &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot;. Three local teams appeared in the UK show, with around 6 to 8 countries competing in the European finals.

==In other countries==
===Europe===
The format of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot; was used in many European countries, with each version forwarding teams for the international version, &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, participants came from the heats of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;. The original presenter was McDonald Hobley, but he stayed for just one series before handing over to Katie Boyle, who in turn was replaced by David Vine and Eddie Waring. It was not until 1971 that the presenter most associated with the role, Stuart Hall, took over presenting the UK heats and also provided the British commentary for the international version along with Waring, who was better known as the BBC&#x27;s Rugby League commentator.

Wales had its own team between 1991 and 1994 and the programme was broadcast on S4C in Welsh by Iestyn Garlick and Nia Chiswell.

===Australia===

&quot;Almost Anything Goes!&quot; aired in Australia from 1976 to 1978. It was hosted by Tim Evans and Brendan Edwards and featured Sean Kramer and Australian Rules player Ron Barassi. It was filmed in Melbourne. The 1976 season featured two complete competitions with initial heats and finals, while the 1977 and 1978 seasons featured only one each. Following the 1977 grand final, the season finale featured a competition between the top two teams from the grand final and a team representing New Zealand.

An Australian version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot; ran on Network Ten from 1985 to 1987. The teams were divided into the Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. The show was hosted by Billy J. Smith, along with Fiona MacDonald for the duration that it aired in Australia. They would arrive to the show in a golf buggy. The show was filmed in a field in Dural, New South Wales, but due to numerous complaints from local residents, the show was dropped in 1987. This version aired in Mexico on the TV Cable Network Multivisión and was a success in 1992, and also in the U.S. on KCAL-TV in Los Angeles &amp; WWOR-TV in New York in 1990–91. It was also adapted and shown in Argentina as &quot;Supermatch&quot;. This version was heavily edited, and the anchors were replaced by off-screen commentators.

In October 2011, it was announced that Channel 10 Australia would re-launch a new version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot; for its 2011–12 summer programming line-up hosted by HG Nelson, Charli Robinson and Brad McEwan. Due to insurance costs, the show was filmed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and ran for eight 1-hour episodes between December 2011 and January 2012 and featured teams of 15 from each state of Australia.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, a series based on &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot; called &quot;Top Town&quot; ran from 1976 to 1990, and was revived in 2009.

===United States: &quot;Almost Anything Goes!&quot;===
The American version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout!&quot;, re-titled &quot;Almost Anything Goes!&quot;, by Bob Banner, aired on ABC in the United States from 31 July to 28 August 1975. It won the time slot on Thursday nights against reruns of &quot;The Waltons&quot; on CBS and a short-lived Ben Vereen variety show (&quot;Comin&#x27; at Ya!&quot;) on NBC.

In the first season, there were four regional events (North, East, South, and West); each had teams representing cities with populations of 20,000 or smaller from three different states, and each city had to be within 200 miles of the other two. The four winners then met in a national final. The second season consisted of 14 episodes, broken up into nine episodes where all three cities were from a particular state, three regional finals (East, South, and West – there was no North regional in the second season) consisting of three state winners, a national final consisting of the three regional winners, and a &quot;Supergames&quot; where the second season winner competed against the first season winner and a team of celebrities representing Hollywood.

For its second season (24 January to 2 May 1976), &quot;AAG!&quot; moved to Saturday nights after the cancellation of the short-lived &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot; variety show. Sports announcers Charlie Jones and Lynn Shackelford were the play-by-play and color men on this version which featured small towns across America playing the games. Sam Riddle, who was one of the producers, served as field reporter in 1975 along with Dick Whittington, the latter being replaced by Regis Philbin in 1976.

Boulder City, Nevada, won the 1975 series and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, won the 1976 series. In a showdown, Boulder City beat Chambersburg and a celebrity all-star team (the &quot;Hollywood Tinsel Towners&quot;). However, it was up against &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;Doc&quot; on CBS and &quot;Emergency!&quot; on NBC, and was shortly cancelled thereafter due to low ratings.

A children&#x27;s version, called &quot;Junior Almost Anything Goes!&quot; and hosted by Soupy Sales, ran on Saturday mornings from 11 September 1976 to 4 September 1977. A syndicated celebrity version (&quot;All Star Anything Goes!&quot;) hosted by Bill Boggs ran from 16 September 1977 to September 1978. Tony DeFranco of The DeFranco Family performed the theme song for the &quot;All Star Anything Goes&quot; syndicated show.

==Charity specials==
Two charity specials were made in the 1980s. &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; of 1987 featured four teams of celebrities, each figureheaded by a member of the British royal family. The event, held at the Alton Towers theme park, was widely derided as a failure, particularly in terms of public perception of the royal family.

In 1988 brought &quot;It&#x27;s a Charity Knockout!&quot;. Games took place around Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, US, and featured celebrity teams representing Australia, UK and US.

==Pop culture==
&quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; was the inspiration for Peter Gabriel&#x27;s hit song &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;. The words &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres&quot; are repeated as the chorus of the song by Kate Bush, and the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s a knockout!&quot; is used in the song as well.

The show was also featured prominently in &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot; as a motive for the Goodies to climb the giant beanstalk; the grand prize was 5,000 puppies.

In 1973 Blue Peter presenters John Noakes, Peter Purves and Lesley Judd participated in some of the games.

<text>Boguslawsky is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southern lunar limb, to the northwest of the slightly larger crater Demonax, and southwest of the concentric crater Boussingault. Due to its location, this crater appears very oblong in shape because of foreshortening.

The floor of this crater is flooded and relatively featureless. The rim is somewhat worn and relatively low above the surrounding surface. The crater Boguslawsky D lies across the eastern rim.

The crater was named after German astronomer Palm Heinrich Ludwig von Boguslawski.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boguslawsky.

The Luna 25 lunar lander mission by Roscosmos was planned to land in the vicinity of crater Boguslawsky. It was launched on 10 August 2023 and it successfully entered lunar orbit six days later. However, on August 19 communications were lost and it was reported to crash on the inner rim of Pontécoulant G crater. If successful, the mission would have sampled and studied the lunar regolith from the upper most layer of the subsurface and measured the content of dust, neutrals and plasma during the cycle of the lunar local time.

<text>Baghdad is a 7-inch EP, released by American punk rock band the Offspring on May 15, 1991. It is currently out of print, but sold 3000 copies within one week of its release. Although Baghdad has never been reissued on CD in its entirety, the title track, &quot;Baghdad&quot;, a re-recorded version of &quot;Tehran&quot; from the band&#x27;s debut studio album, was included on the &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot; compilation from Fat Wreck Chords. The band&#x27;s official website does not list Baghdad in the discography.

==Track notes==
The EP includes an early version of &quot;Get It Right&quot;, of which a later version was released on their second studio album &quot;Ignition&quot;. The title track &quot;Baghdad&quot; was a re-recording of the song &quot;Tehran&quot; which appeared on the Offspring&#x27;s debut self-titled album in 1989. It switches the words &quot;Tehran&quot; (the capital of Iran) for &quot;Baghdad&quot; (the capital of Iraq). The EP includes a re-recorded cover version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; composed by Billy Roberts, the original recording of which was released as a bonus track on the cassette version of the 1989 debut (that same recording was released on the &quot;Gone Away&quot; single and &quot;Happy Hour!&quot;). A previously unreleased instrumental track &quot;The Blurb&quot;, which would not appear on any future releases, served as the basis for an early version of &quot;Genocide&quot;, as well as &quot;Change the World&quot;.

<text>Jeux sans frontières (; &quot;Games Without Borders&quot; in French) is an international television competition organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for thirty seasons, from 1965 to 1999, between members of the union who participated representing their countries. Broadcasters sent mixed teams that competed against each other in a series of games, usually funny physical games played in outlandish costumes though none-the-less technically difficult, with the most successful teams of the season from each country competing in a grand final. Each episode was hosted by one of the participating broadcasters at a location in its country and was themed around a specific topic.

The show was created for the EBU by Guy Lux and Claude Savarit from the &quot;Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française&quot; (ORTF) as an international version of their own show &quot;Intervilles&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1962 in France. In non-French-speaking countries, &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; has alternative titles in the corresponding local languages. It is also widely known in English as &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;, the title of the BBC&#x27;s domestic version that was its national selection for the international competition. The show spawned a winter version held in ski resorts, and single-episode Christmas specials.

==History==
The idea of the show came from French President Charles de Gaulle, whose wish was that French and German youth would meet in a series of games to reinforce the friendship between the two countries. In 1965, Guy Lux and Claude Savarit from the &quot;Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française&quot; (ORTF), and creators of &quot;Intervilles&quot;, spread this idea to other broadcasters within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Teams representing France, West Germany, Belgium, and Italy took part in the first edition of the show held that same year with the title &quot;Inter Nations Games&quot;.

At the height of its popularity, &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; was watched by 110 million viewers across Europe. The original series ended in 1982. It was revived in 1988, with a different mix of countries. In its later editions, it was hosted by smaller broadcasters, with the notable exception of Italy&#x27;s RAI, which hosted three editions with a fixed location in 1996, 1998, and 1999.

==Format==
In its original conception, teams from Belgium, France, West Germany, and Italy competed each week in head-to-head competition between two cities or towns from two of the four competing countries. There would be sports events, but also studio-based quizzes each week. Eventually, all teams would have competed against each other and the teams with the highest cumulative points for each country from the series would meet in two semi-finals, with the two winners meeting in the final. The first series in 1965 ended in a tie between Belgian town Ciney and French town St. Amand. A similar format followed in the longer 1966 series, with more towns competing from each of the four countries.

The more familiar format began in 1967, when teams from Great Britain and Switzerland joined the competition and towns only appeared once in the series heats, with each heat being hosted by one of the participant broadcasters in its country, culminating in a grand final. The quiz element was abandoned and the games became more comical (though none-the-less technically difficult), and began to be played in outlandish costumes (often large foam latex suits) with the contestants competing to complete bizarre tasks in funny games. The teams could not choose which of their members played each game. A draw was held to determine the game participants, who were then allowed to rehearse the game once ahead of the broadcast recording. Each of the teams received a score for each game, and the games were umpired by one or two &quot;international&quot; judges (supported by referees from the participant countries), with the winner of each heat being awarded a silver trophy. The two judges/referees who became synonymous with the series were Swiss nationals Gennaro Olivieri and Guido Pancaldi, who were together on the show from 1966 to 1982. Pancaldi returned for the revived series in 1988.

Typically, the programmes were staged outdoors during the European summer months, although occasionally the competition took place indoors, such as the Dutch heat in 1971, staged at the Ahoy Sports Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Historic market squares or the grounds of famous buildings were often used for the settings, although the surrounds of swimming pools or quay sides for lakes or the sea were very commonly used. The outdoor settings meant that bad weather could often have an impact on the competition, but the games took place regardless of hostile weather conditions. Infamously, a freak storm suddenly hit the 1970 Grand Final staged in the Verona Amphitheatre, leading to the unprotected audience having to flee from the torrential rain and the presenters being stranded without protection, but the show continued.

The series culminated in a grand final, with the most successful team from each country in the series participating. Each finalist would qualify by winning their heat. If a country won more than one heat, the highest scoring winning team for that country would go to the final. Any country that had not won a heat would be represented by the highest scoring team that placed second. Occasionally, this meant that a team with a higher score, but who had finished lower than second, would be displaced by a lower-scoring team that had achieved a second place. In the rare event that none of the country&#x27;s teams had achieved a win or second place in any heat (such as GB in 1967, France in 1968 or Portugal in 1979), the highest-scoring team regardless of place would participate in the final.

Each participating broadcaster hosted one heat of the games in its country, with a rotation as to which of them hosted the grand final. The winner of the grand final would receive a gold trophy, with the runner-up receiving silver and the third-placed team bronze. It was not uncommon for countries to win the grand final with a team that had not won their heat or indeed for countries to win that had not won any heats at all. The Swiss won the grand final in both 1972 and 1974, the Germans in 1977, the Italians in 1978, the Portuguese in 1980 and the British in 1981, all with teams that had finished second in their heats and with none of their teams winning any heats at all. Portugal won the 1980 series trophy without ever having previously won any heats at all in either of their two series to date. The Swiss were twice series winners in 1972 and 1974 despite not winning a single heat in any series for four consecutive series from 1971 to 1974.

Only Belgium and Italy competed in the original series from start to finish (1965–1982). France participated in the 1968 series, but due to industrial action with French television, they were unable to broadcast any of the series domestically and had to cancel hosting their designated heat. West Germany hosted two heats that season in place of the French edition. With the strike action continuing, no French teams participated in the 1969 series. Liechtenstein participated in the series once, replacing the Swiss for the seventh and final heat in the 1976 series, designated as FL rather than CH for the episode. It had been agreed that, should the team from Liechtenstein win their heat, they would be allowed to compete in the Grand Final alongside the best Swiss team. This proved immaterial when Liechtenstein finished fourth of the seven teams in the heat. A team from Derry represented the UK in the German heat of the 1978 series and were designated as NI rather than GB for that episode.

Dutch TV (who joined the competition for the 1970 series) became the first broadcaster to permanently withdraw from the competition at the end of the 1977 series, having never won the series final. Flemish TV in Belgium carried all the series live, whereas Dutch TV recorded the episodes for later transmission (as did many others). Ratings were thus very low in the Netherlands as most viewers had already watched the show with Dutch commentary live from Flemish TV earlier. The Dutch were replaced in the series by Yugoslavia from 1978, who likewise were never the series champions. Portugal joined in 1979, but West Germany left the competition after the 1980 series due to falling ratings. It was agreed to end the contest before the commencement of the 1982 series, which ended with the first outright series win for original participant country Belgium, but it was later revived with a different set of competing countries in 1988.

Some episodes started being produced and broadcast in colour beginning in 1968, but it was not until the 1970 series that the entire series was produced in colour. However, some broadcasters, notably the French and Italians, continued to broadcast the episodes domestically in monochrome for many years, despite producing their own episode in colour. French TV began showing the entire series in colour in 1974, followed by Italy in 1976.

Each heat was presented almost exclusively in the language of the host broadcaster, necessitating commentators explaining and describing the games and state of play to their domestic audiences. This format made the episodes difficult to sell outside of the participants, offering few opportunities to recoup the programme costs from international sales (although the format itself was licensed to many countries). From the late 1970s the BBC was charged with packaging the episodes for international sale including the English/British commentary. This encouraged sales in English speaking countries leading to broadcasts around the world. In some cases, the BBC would add a pre-show introduction from host Stuart Hall and would often trim the show&#x27;s length from the broadcast version. Some episodes were occasionally cut to one hour editions for international sale.

Points were given for each game based on the ranking of the teams. For example, if there were six teams playing the game, the winner would get six points, with five for the second etc. Each team had to miss one game per episode, but all teams always played the final game. A joker could be played once by each team, which doubled their score for that game. The &#x27;Fil Rouge&#x27; round was played individually by each team and after the 1969 series, no joker could be played on that element, although prior to 1970 jokers could be played on the &#x27;Fil Rouge&#x27; and until the end of the 1971 series, jokers could also be played on the final game. This meant there were more points available for that game and many countries thus saved their jokers for the final game. The rules were changed from 1972 onwards, forbidding jokers on the last game. Belgium hosted the first heat of the 1972 series, but saved their joker for the final game. When the team captain presented it to the referees at the final game&#x27;s start, they were told it was not permissible and thus for this heat, Belgium were unable to play their joker at all; the only time any team&#x27;s joker was not contested. The Belgian team of Spa were too far behind the leading teams for the bonus joker points to have had any impact on the heat winners. With the increase in the number of teams to eight from the 1979 series on, the joker system was changed. Teams had to win the game to get a bonus of six points if they played their joker, with four points for finishing second and two points for finishing third. If they failed to finish in the top three for the game, there were no bonus joker points earned. The &#x27;Fil Rouge&#x27; format was changed in 1981 so that all teams competed together in four repetitions of the game, with different team members in each repetition. The teams retained their best score/time from each of the four repetitions to determine the points after the fourth repetition.

;Table key


Each country was assigned a unique colour which it was used on its teams uniforms and equipment. In the original series which ended in 1982, the colours were: Belgium – Yellow; Germany – Light Blue; Great Britain – Red; Italy – Dark Blue; Yugoslavia – White. France were originally assigned Purple, but this changed to Green after 1976. Switzerland were assigned Light Brown, but during the 1979 series, they switched to Red and White combined, confusing their teams with the British participants, necessitating returning to Light Brown in subsequent years, but again, still dressed in red and white for certain heats. The Netherlands were assigned Orange, but when the country left the series after 1977, the colour was reassigned to Portugal from 1979.

== Editions ==

The 1969 Grand Final ended in a tie between German team Wolfsburg and British team Shrewsbury, who both attained 32 points. Under the rules of the competition, Wolfsburg were declared the series winners as the team had scored higher in the Fil Rouge. However, the Wolfsburg team captain insisted that the trophy should be shared and the judges agreed to award both teams joint first place.

After the final game of the 1981 Grand Final was completed, it appeared GB team Dartmouth had won the series golden trophy. However, after an objection raised by the Portuguese, the referees reviewed the game and the French team were disqualified and placed last for the final game. This gained the Portuguese team of Lisbon an extra point, tying them for series winners with Dartmouth.

==Christmas specials==
A winter festive themed special version of the show, usually broadcast during the Christmas period, was a single episode edition contested each year from 1973 until 1981. It was generally alternately staged in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy by RAI (1973, 1975, 1976, 1979) and Aviemore, Scotland by the BBC (1974, 1977, 1981). Switzerland hosted the 1978 edition in Villars and Belgium hosted the 1980 edition in Liège.

In the UK, the show was entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Christmas Knockout!&quot;, with the other competing broadcasters naming it &quot;Zeskamp Speciaal&quot;, &quot;Giochi Sotto L&#x27;Albero&quot;, &quot;Jeux de Noël&quot;, &quot;Weihnachtsspiele&quot;, &quot;Nyårs Knockout&quot;, and &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres: Christmas Special&quot;.

The show was hosted around an indoor or outdoor ice-rink or on snowy ground. On more than one occasion, when snow failed to materialise for the recording, artificial snow or foam was used instead. The games would generally be played on ice-skates or skis. Mainly, only four countries participated in the winter edition: Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands (who continued to take part after leaving the main series) and they were joined by a fifth country, Switzerland that participated in the 1977–1980 editions.

After &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres&quot; ended following the 1982 Grand Final, a winter/Christmas edition was recorded featuring teams from Belgium, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the latter hosting the event in Praia Dourada, with Belgium winning. A decision was taken not to air the broadcast as it was considered sub-standard, with only Belgian television eventually airing the programme on 26 December 1982. A final edition of the original Christmas themed version was shown at Christmas 1983 in a direct competition between Great Britain and Sweden staged in Aviemore.

When &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres&quot; was revived in 1988, the one-off festive edition also returned. The 1990 Christmas special was held in Macau.

===Christmas special editions===
==Winter edition==
&quot;Interneige&quot; or &quot;Jeux sans frontières d&#x27;hiver&quot; is the winter spin-off edition of the competition held in ski resorts for eleven seasons (1965–1968, 1976–1981, and 1992). It was also variously entitled &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres on Ice&quot; or &quot;Jeux Sans Frontieres in the Snow&quot;.
===&quot;Interneige&quot; editions===
==Revival attempts==
In 2006, the EBU announced plans to relaunch the series in summer 2007, in collaboration with Mistral Production and Upside Television. Belgium, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Italy were thought to be participating countries. However, due to financial setbacks, the plans were put on hold—originally for twelve months, but later they were abandoned altogether.

In December 2016, the EBU in strategic planning for 2017–2020 included a new format based on the show, called &quot;Eurovision Super Games&quot;, a new attempt to revisit the TV programme last aired in 1999. Twelve countries had joined and were involved in the project, a competition between eight countries each represented by four athletes playing a series of mental and physical challenges. The audiences at home would have the possibility to elect the two athletes of their country to participate in the proposed challenge. However, due to the lack of financial guarantees, the EBU announced in June 2017 that it would not be created.

A revival of the show was confirmed on 18 June 2019 at the annual France Télévisions press conference, to be produced by Nagui and broadcast on France 2. This revival would later be cancelled in favor of that of &quot;Intervilles&quot;, announced at the turn of the 2020s. Nagui finally announced in October 2023 that the show was no longer a priority, given the cost of living and the financial difficulties of different cities. However, the revival of the show is still a possibility in the future.

=== &quot;Eurogames&quot; ===
In 2019, the EBU lost the rights of the format and was franchised by Mediaset for a season retitled &quot;&quot; filmed at Cinecittà World in Rome. The show was devoted to lighted matches between teams from Italy, Spain, Germany, and Greece alongside newcomers Poland, and Russia. The Italian version aired on Canale 5 from 19 September 2019 to 24 October 2019, with Ilary Blasi and Alvin as hosts. In Spain, six episodes premiered on the streaming service Mitele Plus on 3 January 2020, with Lara Álvarez and Joaquín Prat as hosts, and were later aired on Telecinco. In Greece it was aired on Skai TV and in Cyprus on Sigma TV.

==In popular culture==
* The show inspired Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1980 hit single, &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; (the direct English translation of the title), in which backing vocalist Kate Bush sings &quot;jeux sans frontières&quot; during breaks. The lyrics also refer to title of the British version of the show, &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;.
* The last album of the popular Macedonian pop singer Toše Proeski is named &quot;Games without borders&quot; (in Macedonian Cyrillic: &quot;Игри Без Граници&quot;).
* The &quot;Endeavour&quot; episode &quot;Quartet&quot; (series 5, episode 5) features a fictional 1968 &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot; competition held in Oxford, broadcast by Southern Independent Television (rather than the BBC).
* The show was a major component of &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode, &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot;.
* In &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;, the company that supplies the club with many of the fruit machines (including a &quot;Das Boot&quot; version that only pays out in Deutsche Marks) and other assorted gaming paraphernalia is called Jeux Sans Frontières.
* In 1986, a video game was made, based on the show. It was released on the Commodore 64, the Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum. It was critically panned.

<text>A noisemaker is something intended to make a loud noise, usually for fun. Instruments or devices commonly considered &quot;noisemakers&quot; include:
* pea whistles
* air horns, composed of a pressurized air source coupled to a horn, designed to create an extremely loud noise
* fireworks, such as firecrackers, bottle rockets, bang snaps and others
* party horns, paper tubes often flattened and rolled into a coil, which unrolls when blown into, producing a horn-like noise
* ratchets, orchestral musical instruments played by percussionists. See also derkach and rapach.
* sirens
* vuvuzelas, plastic horns that produce a loud monotone note
* the head joint of recorders
* couesnophones
* Groan Tubes
* moo boxes
* whirly tubes
* firecrackers
Noisemakers are popular with children as toy musical instruments. They can be perfectly included in loud rhythm bands and in the music education for young children.

<text>Hevelius is a low-rimmed lunar impact crater that lies at the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum, named after the astronomer Johannes Hevelius by the IAU in 1935. The smaller but prominent crater Cavalerius is joined to the northern rim by low ridges. Due south of Hevelius is the crater Lohrmann and the dark-hued Grimaldi.

The crater&#x27;s name was approved by the IAU in 1970.

Only a low, eroded rim of Hevelius rises above the surface. The western wall is overlain by several small impacts. The flat floor of the crater has been flooded by lava, and is now cross-crossed by a system of small clefts named the Rimae Hevelius. There is a low, one-km-high central peak offset to the northwest of the midpoint. The northeastern part of the interior is more irregular and contains a straight ridge running toward the southeast. Along the northwest floor, near the inner wall, is a small crater.

Hevelius is a crater of Nectarian age.

This feature is sometimes referred to as Hevel, the astronomer&#x27;s name in German (Hevelius is a Latinized form).

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hevelius.

<text>The science wars were a series of scholarly and public discussions in the 1990s over the social place of science in making authoritative claims about the world.
Encyclopedia.com, citing the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science and Religion&quot;, describes the science wars as the
:&quot;complex of discussions about the way the sciences are related to or incarnated in culture, history, and practice. [...] [which] came to be called a &#x27;war&#x27; in the mid 1990s because of a strong polarization over questions of legitimacy and authority. One side [...] is concerned with defending the authority of science as rooted in objective evidence and rational procedures. The other side argues that it is legitimate and fruitful to study the sciences as institutions and social-technical networks whose development is influenced by linguistics, economics, politics, and other factors surrounding formally rational procedures and isolated established facts.&quot;

The science wars took place principally in the United States in the 1990s in the academic and mainstream press. Scientific realists (such as Norman Levitt, Paul R. Gross, Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal) accused many writers, whom they described as &#x27;postmodernist&#x27;, of having effectively rejected scientific objectivity, the scientific method, empiricism, and scientific knowledge.

Though much of the theory associated with &#x27;postmodernism&#x27; (see post-structuralism) did not make any interventions into the natural sciences, the scientific realists took aim at its general influence. The scientific realists argued that large swathes of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th-century post-structuralist philosophers (such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard and others), whose work they declare to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicate a broad range of fields in this trend, including cultural studies, feminist studies, comparative literature, media studies, and especially science and technology studies, which does apply such methods to the study of science.

Solid-state physicist N. David Mermin understands the science wars as a series of exchanges between scientists and &quot;sociologists, historians and literary critics&quot; who the scientists &quot;thought ...were ludicrously ignorant of science, making all kinds of nonsensical pronouncements. The other side dismissed these charges as naive, ill informed and self-serving.&quot; Sociologist Harry Collins wrote that the &quot;science wars&quot; began &quot;in the early 1990s with attacks by natural scientists or ex-natural scientists who had assumed the role of spokespersons for science. The subject of the attacks was the analysis of science coming out of literary studies and the social sciences.&quot;

==Historical background==
Until the mid-20th century, the philosophy of science had concentrated on the viability of scientific method and knowledge, proposing justifications for the truth of scientific theories and observations and attempting to discover at a philosophical level why science worked. 
Karl Popper, an early opponent of logical positivism in the 20th century, repudiated the classical observationalist/inductivist form of scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. He is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist/verificationist account of knowledge which he replaced with critical rationalism, &quot;the first &quot;non justificational philosophy of criticism&quot; in the history of philosophy&quot;.
His criticisms of scientific method were adopted by several postmodernist critiques.

A number of 20th-century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice. It was the publication of Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part socially determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy.

Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called &quot;paradigms&quot;). Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure. (See sociology of scientific knowledge).

Some interpreted Kuhn&#x27;s ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, social constructs, which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality, and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories. In 1971, Jerome Ravetz published &quot;Scientific knowledge and its social problems&quot;, a book describing the role that the scientific community, as a social construct, plays in accepting or rejecting objective scientific knowledge.

=== Postmodernism ===

A number of different philosophical and historical schools, often grouped together as &quot;postmodernism&quot;, began reinterpreting scientific achievements of the past through the lens of the practitioners, often positing the influence of politics and economics in the development of scientific theories in addition to scientific observations. Rather than being presented as working entirely from positivistic observations, many scientists of the past were scrutinized for their connection to issues of gender, sexual orientation, race, and class. Some more radical philosophers, such as Paul Feyerabend, argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in religion) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations.

Imre Lakatos advanced a midway view between the &quot;postmodernist&quot; and &quot;realist&quot; camps. For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a &quot;core&quot; of a &quot;research program&quot; is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core. Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power. Resisting falsification only becomes &quot;ad-hoc&quot; and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less. But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive. Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified.

==The science wars==
In &quot;Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science&quot; (1994), scientists Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt accused postmodernists of anti-intellectualism, presented the shortcomings of relativism, and suggested that postmodernists knew little about the scientific theories they criticized and practiced poor scholarship for political reasons. The authors insist that the &quot;science critics&quot; misunderstood the theoretical approaches they criticized, given their &quot;caricature, misreading, and condescension, [rather] than argument&quot;. The book sparked the so-called science wars. &quot;Higher Superstition&quot; inspired a New York Academy of Sciences conference titled &quot;The Flight from Science and Reason&quot;, organized by Gross, Levitt, and Gerald Holton. Attendees of the conference were critical of the polemical approach of Gross and Levitt, yet agreed upon the intellectual inconsistency of how laymen, non-scientist, and social studies intellectuals dealt with science.

===&quot;Social Text&quot;===
In 1996, &quot;Social Text&quot;, a left-wing Duke University publication of postmodern critical theory, compiled a &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the social sciences and the humanities, that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science. In the introduction to the issue, the &quot;Social Text&quot; editor, activist Andrew Ross, said that the attack upon science studies was a conservative reaction to reduced funding for scientific research. He characterized the &quot;Flight from Science and Reason&quot; conference as an attempted &quot;linking together a host of dangerous threats: scientific creationism, New Age alternatives and cults, astrology, UFO-ism, the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of Aryan-Nazi science and the Soviet error of Lysenkoism&quot; that &quot;degenerated into name-calling&quot;.

In another &quot;Social Text&quot; article, the postmodern sociologist Dorothy Nelkin characterised Gross and Levitt&#x27;s vigorous response as a &quot;call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State&quot;—in contrast to the scientists&#x27; historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as creation science, the animal rights movement, and anti-abortionists&#x27; attempts to curb fetal research. At the end of the Soviet–American Cold War (1945–91), military funding of science declined, while funding agencies demanded accountability, and research became directed by private interests. Nelkin suggested that postmodernist critics were &quot;convenient scapegoats&quot; who diverted attention from problems in science.

Also in 1996, physicist Alan Sokal had submitted an article to &quot;Social Text&quot; titled &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot;, which proposed that quantum gravity is a linguistic and social construct and that quantum physics supports postmodernist criticisms of scientific objectivity. The staff published it in the &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue as a relevant contribution, later claiming that they held the article back from earlier issues due to Sokal&#x27;s alleged refusal to consider revisions. Later, in the May 1996 issue of &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;, in the article &quot;A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies&quot;, Sokal exposed his parody-article, &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries&quot; as an experiment testing the intellectual rigor of an academic journal that would &quot;publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors&#x27; ideological preconceptions&quot;. The matter became known as the &quot;Sokal Affair&quot; and brought greater public attention to the wider conflict.

Jacques Derrida, a frequent target of anti-relativist and anti-postmodern criticism in the wake of Sokal&#x27;s article, responded to the hoax in &quot;Sokal and Bricmont Aren&#x27;t Serious&quot;, first published in &quot;Le Monde&quot;. He called Sokal&#x27;s action sad (&quot;triste&quot;) for having overshadowed Sokal&#x27;s mathematical work and ruined the chance to sort out controversies of scientific objectivity in a careful way. Derrida went on to fault him and co-author Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith: they had accused him of scientific incompetence in the English edition of a follow-up book (an accusation several English reviewers noted), but deleted the accusation from the French edition and denied that it had ever existed. He concluded, as the title indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a &quot;quick practical joke&quot; to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.

===Continued conflict===
In the first few years after the &#x27;Science Wars&#x27; edition of &quot;Social Text&quot;, the seriousness and volume of discussion increased significantly, much of it focused on reconciling the &#x27;warring&#x27; camps of postmodernists and scientists. One significant event was the &#x27;Science and Its Critics&#x27; conference in early 1997; it brought together scientists and scholars who study science and featured Alan Sokal and Steve Fuller as keynote speakers. The conference generated the final wave of substantial press coverage (in both news media and scientific journals), though by no means resolved the fundamental issues of social construction and objectivity in science.

Other attempts have been made to reconcile the two camps. Mike Nauenberg, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, organized a small conference in May 1997 that was attended by scientists and sociologists of science alike, among them Alan Sokal, N. David Mermin and Harry Collins. In the same year, Collins organized the Southampton Peace Workshop, which again brought together a broad range of scientists and sociologists. The Peace Workshop gave rise to the idea of a book that intended to map out some of the arguments between the disputing parties. &quot;The One Culture?: A Conversation about Science&quot;, edited by chemist Jay A. Labinger and sociologist Harry Collins, was eventually published in 2001. The book&#x27;s title is a reference to C. P. Snow&#x27;s &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;. It contains contributions from authors such as Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont, Steven Weinberg, and Steven Shapin.

Other significant publications related to the science wars include &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; by Sokal and Jean Bricmont (1998), &quot;The Social Construction of What?&quot; by Ian Hacking (1999) and &quot;Who Rules in Science&quot; by James Robert Brown (2004).

To John C. Baez, the Bogdanov Affair in 2002 served as the bookend to the Sokal controversy: the review, acceptance, and publication of papers, later alleged to be nonsense, in peer-reviewed physics journals. Cornell physics professor Paul Ginsparg, argued that the cases are not at all similar and that the fact that some journals and scientific institutions have low standards is &quot;hardly a revelation&quot;. The new editor in chief of the journal &quot;Annals of Physics&quot;, who was appointed after the controversy along with a new editorial staff, had said that the standards of the journal had been poor leading up to the publication since the previous editor had become sick and died.

Interest in the science wars has waned considerably in recent years. Though the events of the science wars are still occasionally mentioned in the mainstream press, they have had little effect on either the scientific community or the community of critical theorists. Both sides continue to maintain that the other does not understand their theories, or mistakes constructive criticisms and scholarly investigations for attacks. In 1999, the French sociologist Bruno Latour—at the time believing that the natural sciences are socially constructivist—said, &quot;Scientists always stomp around meetings talking about &#x27;bridging the two-culture gap&#x27;, but when scores of people from outside the sciences begin to build just that bridge, they recoil in horror and want to impose the strangest of all gags on free speech since Socrates: only scientists should speak about science!&quot; Subsequently, Latour has suggested a re-evaluation of sociology&#x27;s epistemology based on lessons learned from the Science Wars: &quot;... scientists made us realize that there was not the slightest chance that the type of social forces we use as a cause could have objective facts as their effects&quot;.

Reviewing Sokal&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Hoax&quot;, Mermin stated that &quot;As a sign that the science wars are over, I cite the 2008 election of Bruno Latour [...] to Foreign Honorary Membership in that bastion of the establishment, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot; and opined that &quot;we are not only beyond Sokal&#x27;s hoax, but beyond the science wars themselves&quot;.

However, more recently, some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their critiques have, at times, been counter-productive and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests.

Writing about these developments in the context of global warming, Latour noted that &quot;dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we said?&quot;

Kendrick Frazier notes that Latour is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that Latour has said that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.

In 2016, Shawn Lawrence Otto, in his book &quot;The War on Science: Who&#x27;s Waging It, Why It Matters, and What We can Do About It,&quot; that the winners of the war on science &quot;will chart the future of power, democracy, and freedom itself.&quot;

<text>Textile manufacture during the British Industrial Revolution was centred in south Lancashire and the towns on both sides of the Pennines in the United Kingdom. The main drivers of the Industrial Revolution were textile manufacturing, iron founding, steam power, oil drilling, the discovery of electricity and its many industrial applications, the telegraph and many others. Railroads, steamboats, the telegraph and other innovations massively increased worker productivity and raised standards of living by greatly reducing time spent during travel, transportation and communications.

Before the 18th century, the manufacture of cloth was performed by individual workers, in the premises in which they lived and goods were transported around the country by packhorses or by river navigations and contour-following canals that had been constructed in the early 18th century. In the mid-18th century, artisans were inventing ways to become more productive. Silk, wool, and linen fabrics were being eclipsed by cotton which became the most important textile.

Innovations in carding and spinning enabled by advances in cast iron technology resulted in the creation of larger spinning mules and water frames. The machinery was housed in water-powered mills on streams. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered beam engines, and rotative mill engines transmitting the power to line shafts on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated power looms working in weaving sheds. The scale of production in the mill towns round Manchester created a need for a commercial structure; for a cotton exchange and warehousing. The technology was used in woollen and worsted mills in the West Yorkshire and elsewhere.

==Elements of the Industrial Revolution==

The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations, made in the second half of the 18th century:
*John Kay&#x27;s 1733 flying shuttle enabled cloth to be woven faster, of a greater width, and for the process to later be mechanised. Cotton spinning using Richard Arkwright&#x27;s water frame, James Hargreaves&#x27; Spinning Jenny, and Samuel Crompton&#x27;s Spinning Mule (a combination of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame). This was patented in 1769 and so came out of patent in 1783. The end of the patent was rapidly followed by the erection of many cotton mills. Similar technology was subsequently applied to spinning worsted yarn for various textiles and flax for linen.
*The improved steam engine invented by James Watt and patented in 1775 was initially mainly used for pumping out mines, for water supply systems and to a lesser extend to power air blast for blast furnaces, but from the 1780s was applied to power machines. This enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where waterpower was not available or not steady throughout the seasons. Early steam engines had poor speed control, which caused thread breakage, limiting their use in operations like spinning; however, this problem could be overcome by using the engine to pump water over a water wheel to drive the machinery.
*In the Iron industry, coke was finally applied to all stages of iron smelting, replacing charcoal. This had been achieved much earlier for lead and copper as well as for producing pig iron in a blast furnace, but the second stage in the production of bar iron depended on the use of potting and stamping (for which a patent expired in 1786) or puddling (patented by Henry Cort in 1783 and 1784). Using a steam engine to power blast air to blast furnaces made higher furnace temperatures possible, which allowed the use of more lime to tie up sulfur in coal or coke. The steam engine also overcame the shortage of water power for iron works. Iron production surged after the 1750s when steam engines were increasingly employed in iron works.

These represent three &#x27;leading sectors&#x27;, in which there were key innovations, which allowed the economic takeoff by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. Later inventions such as the power loom and Richard Trevithick&#x27;s high pressure steam engine were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering cotton mills and ironworks enabled these to be built in places that were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there was water to power a watermill.

==Industry and invention==
Before the 1760s, textile production was a cottage industry using mainly flax and wool. A typical weaving family would own one handloom, which would be operated by the man with help of a boy; the wife, girls and other women could make sufficient yarn for that loom.

The knowledge of textile production had existed for centuries. India had a textile industry that used cotton, from which it manufactured cotton textiles. When raw cotton was exported to Europe it could be used to make fustian.

Two systems had developed for spinning: the simple wheel, which used an intermittent process and the more refined, Saxony wheel which drove a differential spindle and flyer with a heck that guided the thread onto the bobbin, as a continuous process. This was satisfactory for use on handlooms, but neither of these wheels could produce enough thread for the looms after the invention by John Kay in 1734 of the flying shuttle, which made the loom twice as productive.

Cloth production moved away from the cottage into &quot;manufactories&quot;. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool, and worsted was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialized in weaving fabric was called a weaving shed.

==Early inventions==
===East India Company===
During the second half of the 17th century, the newly established factories of the East India Company in South Asia started to produce finished cotton goods in quantity for the British market. The imported Calico and chintz garments competed with, and acted as a substitute for Indian wool and the linen produce, resulting in local weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers petitioning their MPs and in turn Parliament for a ban on the importation, and later the sale of woven cotton goods. Which they eventually achieved via the 1700 and 1721 Calico Acts. The acts banned the importation and later the sale of finished pure cotton produce, but did not restrict the importation of raw cotton, or sale or production of Fustian.

The exemption of raw cotton saw two thousand bales of cotton being imported annually, from Asia and the Americas, and forming the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they wished to compete with the EIC imports.

Indian cotton textiles, mainly those from Bengal, continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with Indian goods, British merchants invested in labour-saving technical advancements, while the government implemented protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world&#x27;s leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century. 

===Britain===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, much of the imported cotton came from plantations in the American South. In periods of political uncertainty in North America, during the Revolutionary War and later American Civil War, however, Britain relied more heavily on imports from the Indian subcontinent to supply its cotton manufacturing industry. Ports on the west coast of Britain, such as Liverpool, Bristol, and Glasgow, became important in determining the sites of the cotton industry.

Lancashire became a centre for the nascent cotton industry because the damp climate was better for spinning the yarn. As the cotton thread was not strong enough to use as warp, wool or linen or fustian had to be used. Lancashire was an existing wool centre. Likewise, Glasgow benefited from the same damp climate.

The early advances in weaving had been halted by the lack of thread. The spinning process was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce. In the 1760s, James Hargreaves improved thread production when he invented the Spinning Jenny. By the end of the decade, Richard Arkwright had developed the water frame. This invention had two important consequences: it improved the quality of the thread, which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp, and it took spinning away from the artisans&#x27; homes to specific locations where fast-flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines. The Western Pennines of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry. Not long after the invention of the water frame, Samuel Crompton combined the principles of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his Spinning Mule. This provided even tougher and finer cotton thread.

The textile industry was also to benefit from other developments of the period. As early as 1691, Thomas Savery had made a vacuum steam engine. His design, which was unsafe, was improved by Thomas Newcomen in 1698. In 1765, James Watt further modified Newcomen&#x27;s engine to design an external condenser steam engine. Watt continued to make improvements on his design, producing a separate condenser engine in 1774 and a rotating separate condensing engine in 1781. Watt formed a partnership with businessman Matthew Boulton, and together they manufactured steam engines which could be used by industry.

Prior to the 1780s, most of the fine quality cotton muslin in circulation in Britain had been manufactured in India. Due to advances in technique, British &quot;mull muslin&quot; was able to compete in quality with Indian muslin by the end of the 18th century.

===Timeline of inventions===
In 1734 in Bury, Lancashire, John Kay invented the flying shuttle — one of the first of a series of inventions associated with the cotton industry. The flying shuttle increased the width of cotton cloth and speed of production of a single weaver at a loom. Resistance by workers to the perceived threat to jobs delayed the widespread introduction of this technology, even though the higher rate of production generated an increased demand for spun cotton. 

In 1738, Lewis Paul (one of the community of Huguenot weavers that had been driven out of France in a wave of religious persecution) settled in Birmingham and with John Wyatt, of that town, they patented the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing wool to a more even thickness. Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds yarn could be twisted and spun quickly and efficiently. This was later used in the first cotton spinning mill during the Industrial Revolution.

1742: Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by donkey; this was not profitable and was soon closed.

1743: A factory opened in Northampton, fifty spindles turned on five of Paul and Wyatt&#x27;s machines proving more successful than their first mill. This operated until 1764.

1748: Lewis Paul invented the hand driven carding machine. A coat of wire slips were placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder. Lewis&#x27;s invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, although this came about under great suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn&#x27;s factory in Leominster which specifically used Paul and Wyatt&#x27;s spindles. Bourn produced a similar patent in the same year.

1758: Paul and Wyatt based in Birmingham improved their roller spinning machine and took out a second patent. Richard Arkwright later used this as the model for his water frame.

=== Start of the Revolution ===
The Duke of Bridgewater&#x27;s canal connected Manchester to the coal fields of Worsley. It was opened in July 1761. Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Foundry engineering works in Handsworth, Birmingham in 1762. These were both events that enabled cotton mill construction and the move away from home-based production.
In 1764, Thorp Mill the first water-powered cotton mill in the world was constructed at Royton, Lancashire, England. It was used for carding cotton.

The multiple spindle spinning jenny was invented in 1764. James Hargreaves is credited as the inventor. This machine increased the thread production capacity of a single worker — initially eightfold and subsequently much further. Others credit the original invention to Thomas Highs. Industrial unrest forced Hargreaves to leave Blackburn, but more importantly for him, his unpatented idea was exploited by others. He finally patented it in 1770. As a result, there were over 20,000 spinning jennies in use (mainly unlicensed) by the time of his death.
Richard Arkwright first spinning mill, Cromford Mill, Derbyshire, was built in 1771. It contained his invention the water frame. The water frame was developed from the spinning frame that Arkwright had developed with (a different) John Kay, from Warrington. The original design was again claimed by Thomas Highs: which he purposed he had patented in 1769. Arkwright used waterwheels to power the textile machinery. His initial attempts at driving the frame had used horse power, but a mill needed far more power. Using a waterwheel demanded a location with a ready supply of water, hence the mill at Cromford. This mill is preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills Arkwright generated jobs and constructed accommodation for his workers which he moved into the area. This led to a sizeable industrial community. Arkwright protected his investment from industrial rivals and potentially disruptive workers. This model worked and he expanded his operations to other parts of the country.

Matthew Boulton partnership with Scottish engineer James Watt resulted, in 1775, in the commercial production of the more efficient Watt steam engine which used a separate condensor.

Samuel Crompton of Bolton combined elements of the spinning jenny and water frame in 1779, creating the spinning mule. This mule produced a stronger thread than the water frame could. Thus in 1780, there were two viable hand-operated spinning systems that could be easily adapted to run by power of water. Early mules were suitable for producing yarn for use in the manufacture of muslin, and were known as the muslin wheel or the Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood (pronounced Hall-ith-wood) wheel. As with Kay and Hargreaves, Crompton was not able to exploit his invention for his own profit, and died a pauper.

In 1783 a mill was built in Manchester at Shudehill, at the highest point in the city away from the river. Shudehill Mill was powered by a 30 ft diameter waterwheel. Two storage ponds were built, and the water from one passed from one to the other turning the wheel. A steam driven pump returned the water to the higher reservoir. The steam engine was of the atmospheric type. An improvement devised by Joshua Wrigley, trialled in Chorlton-upon-Medlock used two Savery engines to supplement the river in driving on overshot waterwheel.
In 1784, Edmund Cartwright invented the power loom, and produced a prototype in the following year. His initial venture to exploit this technology failed, although his advances were recognised by others in the industry. Others such as Robert Grimshaw (whose factory was destroyed in 1790 as part of the growing reaction against the mechanization of the industry) and Austin – developed the ideas further.

In the 1790s industrialists, such as John Marshall at Marshall&#x27;s Mill in Leeds, started to work on ways to apply some of the techniques which had proved so successful in cotton to other materials, such as flax.

In 1803, William Radcliffe invented the dressing frame which was patented under the name of Thomas Johnson which enabled power looms to operate continuously.

===Later developments===
With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanised textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure - the canals and, after 1831, the railways - facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth.

The use of water power to drive mills was supplemented by steam driven water pumps, and then superseded completely by the steam engines. For example, Samuel Greg joined his uncle&#x27;s firm of textile merchants, and, on taking over the company in 1782, he sought out a site to establish a mill. Quarry Bank Mill was built on the River Bollin at Styal in Cheshire. It was initially powered by a water wheel, but installed steam engines in 1810. In 1830, the average power of a mill engine was 48 hp, but Quarry Bank mill installed a new 100 hp water wheel. This was to change in 1836, when Horrocks &amp; Nuttall, Preston took delivery of 160 hp double engine. William Fairbairn addressed the problem of line-shafting and was responsible for improving the efficiency of the mill. In 1815 he replaced the wooden turning shafts that drove the machines at 50rpm, to wrought iron shafting working at 250 rpm, these were a third of the weight of the previous ones and absorbed less power. The mill operated until 1959.

====Robert&#x27;s power loom====

In 1830, using an 1822 patent, Richard Roberts manufactured the first loom with a cast-iron frame, the Roberts Loom. In 1842 James Bullough and William Kenworthy, made the Lancashire Loom. It is a semiautomatic power loom. Although it is self-acting, it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the Lancashire cotton industry for a century, when the Northrop Loom invented in 1894 with an automatic weft replenishment function gained ascendancy.

====Robert&#x27;s self acting mule====

Also in 1830, Richard Roberts patented the first self-acting mule. The Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824, this stimulated research into the problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule. The &quot;draw&quot; while spinning had been assisted by power, but the &quot;push&quot; of the wind had been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by semiskilled labour. Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after, self-acting mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built.
The savings that could be made with this technology were considerable. A worker spinning cotton at a hand-powered spinning wheel in the 18th century would take more than 50,000 hours to spin 100 lb of cotton; by the 1790s, the same quantity could be spun in 300 hours by mule, and with a self-acting mule it could be spun by one worker in just 135 hours.

==Working practices==
The nature of work changed during industrialisation from a craft production model to a factory-centric model. It was during the years 1761 to 1850 that these changes happened. Textile factories organized workers&#x27; lives much differently from craft production. Handloom weavers worked at their own pace, with their own tools, and within their own cottages. Factories set hours of work, and the machinery within them shaped the pace of work. Factories brought workers together within one building to work on machinery that they did not own. Factories also increased the division of labour. They narrowed the number and scope of tasks. They included children and women within a common production process. As Manchester mill owner Friedrich Engels decried, the family structure itself was &quot;turned upside down&quot; as women&#x27;s wages undercut men&#x27;s, forcing men to &quot;sit at home&quot; and care for children while the wife worked long hours. Factories flourished over manual craftsmanship because they had more efficient production output per worker, keeping prices down for the public, and they had much more consistent quality of product. The work-discipline was forcefully instilled upon the workforce by the factory owners, and he found that the working conditions were poor, and poverty levels were at an unprecedented high. Engels was appalled, and his research in Derby played a large role in his and Marx&#x27;s book &#x27;Das Kapital&#x27;.

At times, the workers rebelled against poor wages. The first major industrial action in Scotland was that of the Calton weavers in Glasgow, who went on strike for higher wages in the summer of 1787. In the ensuing disturbances, troops were called in to keep the peace and three of the weavers were killed. There was continued unrest. In Manchester in May 1808, 15,000 protesters gathered on St George&#x27;s Fields and were fired on by dragoons, with one man dying. A strike followed, but was eventually settled by a small wage increase.

In the general strike of 1842, half a million workers demanded the Charter and an end to pay cuts. Again, troops were called in to keep the peace, and the strike leaders were arrested, but some of the worker demands were met.

The early textile factories employed a large share of children, but the share declined over time. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. Sir Robert Peel, a mill owner turned reformer, promoted the 1802 Health and Morals of Apprentices Act, which was intended to prevent pauper children from working more than 12 hours a day in mills. Children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as mule scavengers under the working machinery until they were eight, they progressed to working as little piecers which they did until they were 15. During this time they worked 14 to 16 hours a day, being beaten if they fell asleep. The children were sent to the mills of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire from the workhouses in London and other towns in the south of England. A well-documented example was that of Litton Mill. Further legislation followed. By 1835, the share of the workforce under 18 years of age in cotton mills in England and Scotland had fallen to 43%. About half of workers in Manchester and Stockport cotton factories surveyed in 1818 and 1819 had begun work at under ten years of age. Most of the adult workers in cotton factories in mid-19th-century Britain were workers who had begun work as child labourers. The growth of this experienced adult factory workforce helps to account for the shift away from child labour in textile factories.

==A representative early spinning mill 1771==

Cromford Mill was an early Arkwright mill and was the model for future mills. The site at Cromford had year-round supply of warm water from the sough which drained water from nearby lead mines, together with another brook. It was a five-storey mill. Starting in 1772, the mills ran day and night with two 12-hour shifts.

It started with 200 workers, more than the locality could provide so Arkwright built housing for them nearby, one of the first manufacturers to do so. Most of the employees were women and children, the youngest being only 7 years old. Later, the minimum age was raised to 10 and the children were given 6 hours of education a week, so that they could do the record keeping their illiterate parents could not.

The first stage of the spinning process is carding, initially this was done by hand, but in 1775 he took out a second patent for a water-powered carding machine and this led to increased output. He was soon building further mills on this site and eventually employed 1,000 workers at Cromford. By the time of his death in 1792, he was the wealthiest untitled person in Britain.
The gate to Cromford Mill was shut at precisely 6am and 6pm every day and any worker who failed to get through it not only lost a day&#x27;s pay but was fined another day&#x27;s pay. In 1779, Arkwright installed a cannon, loaded with grapeshot, just inside the factory gate, as a warning to would-be rioting textile workers, who had burned down another of his mills in Birkacre, Lancashire. The cannon was never used.

The mill structure is classified as a Grade I listed building, it was first classified in June 1950.
==A representative mid-century spinning mill 1840==
Brunswick Mill, Ancoats is a cotton spinning mill in Ancoats, Manchester, Greater Manchester. It was built around 1840, part of a group of mills built along the Ashton Canal, and at that time it was one of the country&#x27;s largest mills. It was built round a quadrangle, a seven-storey block faced the canal. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in 1967.

The Brunswick mill was built around 1840 in one phase. The main seven storey block that faces the Ashton Canal was used for spinning. The preparation was done on the second floor and the self-acting mules with 400 spindles were arranged transversely on the floors above. The wings contained the blowing rooms, some spinning and ancillary processes like winding. The four storey range facing Bradford Road was used for warehousing and offices. The mill was built by David Bellhouse, but it is suspected that William Fairbairn was involved in the design. It is built from brick, and has slate roofs. Fireproof internal construction was now standard. Brunswick was built using cast iron columns and beams, each floor was vaulted with transverse brick arches. There was no wood in the structure. It was powered by a large double beam engine.

In 1850 the mill had some 276 carding machines, and 77,000 mule spindles, 20 drawing frames, fifty slubbing frames and eighty one roving frames.

The structure was good and it successfully converted to ring spinning in 1920- and was the first mill to adopt mains electricity as its principal source of power. The mill structure was classified as a Grade II listed building in June 1994.
==Export of technology==
While profiting from expertise arriving from overseas (e.g. Lewis Paul), Britain was very protective of home-grown technology. In particular, engineers with skills in constructing the textile mills and machinery were not permitted to emigrate — particularly to the fledgeling America. 

;Horse power (1780–1790)
The earliest cotton mills in the United States were horse-powered. The first mill to use this method was the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, built in Beverly, Massachusetts. It was started on 18 August 1788 by entrepreneur John Cabot and brothers. It was operated in joint by Moses Brown, Israel Thorndike, Joshua Fisher, Henry Higginson, and Deborah Higginson Cabot. The Salem Mercury reported that in April 1788 the equipment for the mill was complete, consisting of a spinning jenny, a carding machine, warping machine, and other tools. That same year the mill&#x27;s location was finalized and built in the rural outsets of North Beverly. The location had the presence of natural water, but it was cited the water was used for upkeep of the horses and cleaning of equipment, and not for mass-production.

Much of the internal designs of the Beverly mill were hidden due to concerns of competitors stealing designs. The beginning efforts were all researched behind closed doors, even to the point that the owners of the mill set up milling equipment on their estates to experiment with the process. There were no published articles describing exactly how their process worked in detail. Additionally, the mill&#x27;s horse-powered technology was quickly dwarfed by new water-powered methods.

;Slater
Following the creation of the United States, an engineer who had worked as an apprentice to Arkwright&#x27;s partner Jedediah Strutt evaded the ban. In 1789, Samuel Slater took his skills in designing and constructing factories to New England, and he was soon engaged in reproducing the textile mills that helped America with its own industrial revolution.

Local inventions spurred this on, and in 1793 Eli Whitney invented and patented the cotton gin, which sped up the processing of raw cotton by over 50 times.

=== 1800s ===

In the mid-1800s some of the technology and tools were sold and exported to Russia. The Morozovs family, a well known 19th-century Russian merchant and textile family established a private company in central Russia that produced dyed fabrics on an industrial scale. Savva Morozov studied the process at the University of Cambridge in England and later, with the help of his family, widened his family&#x27;s business and made it one of the most profitable in the Russian Empire.
