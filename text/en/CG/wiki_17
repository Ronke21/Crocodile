<text>The 2002 Australian Grand Prix (formally the 2002 Foster&#x27;s Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race contested on 3 March 2002 at the Albert Park Circuit, Albert Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The race, which drew 127,000 spectators, was the first of the 2002 Formula One World Championship and the 18th Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 58-lap race after starting second. Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya finished second, and McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen took third, his maiden podium finish.

Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello took pole position after setting the best qualifying lap. He retired at the start of the race after braking too early for the first corner, catching Williams driver Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the rear of Barrichello&#x27;s car. Six drivers were involved in a separate incident. The safety car was deployed for four laps to clear the track. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard led the first ten laps before a mistake on lap eleven allowed Michael Schumacher to pass him. Montoya then passed Schumacher for first place on lap twelve. He maintained the lead until he ran wide and Michael Schumacher passed him to retake it. He led the rest of the race to claim his 54th career victory.

Following this, the season&#x27;s opening round, Michael Schumacher left Australia leading the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points. Montoya was four points behind in second with Räikkönen third. With sixteen races left in the season, Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship from Williams and McLaren.

==Background==
The event&#x27;s planning began in January 2002. Due to the death of marshal Graham Beveridge in an accident in the 2001 race, it was only on the 2002 Formula One World Championship&#x27;s provisional calendar. Formula One&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), later confirmed it would be held following the publication of a coroner&#x27;s report ruling Beveridge&#x27;s death &quot;avoidable&quot;. It was the first of 17 races of 2002 and the 18th Formula One World Championship Australian race. It occurred at the Albert Park Circuit in the Melbourne suburb of Albert Park in Victoria on 3 March. To improve safety, the height of the safety fences was raised to , cages to safeguard race officials were installed and the size of access openings reduced.

Several teams retained their 2001 lineups for the 2002 season, while others changed drivers. The Benetton team was renamed Renault, ending its 16-year involvement in Formula One, and Toyota debuted with drivers Allan McNish and Mika Salo after the Japanese car maker spent 2001 developing the TF102. The Prost team was liquidated in January 2002 after failing to find funding from sponsors or a buyer. The double world champion Mika Häkkinen took a sabbatical and fellow Finn Kimi Räikkönen replaced him at McLaren, whose Sauber car was driven by Felipe Massa, the 2001 Euro Formula 3000 champion. At the Jordan team, the 2001 British Formula Three champion Takuma Sato paired with Giancarlo Fisichella, whom Jarno Trulli replaced at Renault. Former Prost driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen drove Jos Verstappen&#x27;s Arrows car, and Fernando Alonso left Minardi to become Renault&#x27;s test driver; he was replaced by International Formula 3000 competitor Mark Webber.

At the front of the field, the press and bookmakers tipped Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher to win his fifth World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya as his main rival. Schumacher stated that his goal for the season was to win the championship and tie Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s all-time record of five titles, &quot;Our motivation is still unchanged, our target and goals are still the same. We want to once again win both world championships and there is nothing nicer than winning with Ferrari.&quot; Montoya stated that he felt more relaxed than in 2001 since he knew his team better, &quot;I think I showed everyone out there that I am competitive and that&#x27;s the important thing. It was a lot harder to win in Formula One than in CART because it took longer to understand the car, but now that&#x27;s done I&#x27;m looking to do better in 2002.&quot; Former driver Derek Warwick believed Michael Schumacher was the best driver in Formula One and suspected Montoya lacked emotional maturity.

Due to performance and reliability issues, Ferrari brought the F2001B to Australia instead of the F2002. According to Ferrari team principal Jean Todt, the F2002 was fast in pre-season testing, but the team did not have enough time to ensure that it would be reliable in Australia, &quot;We think it will be able to bring home valuable points for the championship. Next week, we will continue our on-track development of the F2002, as well as fine-tuning the F2001 for the first race.&quot; During the first two practice sessions, the F2001 was fitted with a rear wing used on the F2002 in testing; both Michael Schumacher and his teammate Rubens Barrichello opted for one seen at the 2001 Japanese Grand Prix. The McLaren MP4-17 car had an attachment to its lower front suspension frame split to promote airflow beneath the front wing, as well as altered ailerons in the front and back. The Jordan, Arrows and Sauber teams copied the design.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first session, which was held in changing weather, resulted in the fastest times late on. Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:28.804, 0.363 seconds faster than his teammate Barrichello in second. Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher, Massa, the Jaguar duo of Pedro de la Rosa and Eddie Irvine, Frentzen, Salo and Renault&#x27;s Jenson Button foallowed in third through tenth.
Michael Schumacher set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:27.276 in the second session. His teammate Barrichello was 0.523 seconds slower in second. The two Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya, Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld, Salo, Räikkönen, Massa, Fisichella and Trulli were in positions three to ten. During the session, Enrique Bernoldi stopped his Arrows A23 car with a broken gearbox. Barrichello spun through 360 degrees across the grass and reemerged onto the circuit soon after. Montoya braked too late and returned to the track via an escape road and a gravel trap. A short light rain shower made the circuit slippery and caught out Alex Yoong; he beached his Minardi car in the turn one gravel trap. An engine failure ended Fisichella&#x27;s session early and his teammate Sato ran across a gravel trap.

The weather for the third session was cool, damp and overcast. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s updated unofficial lap record of 1:26.177 maintained Ferrari&#x27;s lead. Barrichello was 0.321 seconds slower in second. McLaren&#x27;s Coulthard and Räikkönen, Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher and Montoya, British American Racing (BAR) driver Olivier Panis, Sauber teammates Heidfeld and Massa along with Trulli followed in the top ten. Sato lost control of his Jordan EJ12 car&#x27;s rear on the entry to Stewart turn with 13 minutes and 34 seconds remaining and crashed into the left-hand side tyre barrier at . Sato was unhurt; practice was stopped for nine minutes to allow marshals to clean the track. Since spare cars could not be used in free practice, Sato missed the fourth session since his car required repairs.

A brief rain shower saturated the racetrack during the fourth session, preventing lap times from improving as some drivers drove off the track.Hence, no driver bettered Michael Schumacher&#x27;s fastest time, as Barrichello in second halved the gap to his teammate. The Williams duo of Montoya and Ralf Schumacher improved to third and fourth and the McLaren pair of Coulthard and Räikkönen fell to fifth and sixth. Heidfeld, the BAR duo of Jacques Villeneuve and Panis and Fisichella were seventh to tenth.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each racer was limited to twelve laps, with the starting position set by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, requiring each driver to achieve a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session began on a dry track until a heavy rainstorm fell halfway through, making the circuit slippery and prevented any improvement in lap time. Barrichello completed two laps before it rained (the first was compromised by slower traffic); he took the fourth career pole position and his first since the 2000 British Grand Prix with a time of 1:25.843. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Michael Schumacher, who made an error on a kerb in the first sector. Third-placed Ralf Schumacher stayed in the garage for the opening three minutes to avoid slower traffic. Fourth-placed Coulthard attempted to pass an unsighted Villeneuve on the outside of the final turn, but they collided. Coulthard&#x27;s right-rear wheel hit the wall and he spun onto a run-off area. An error put his teammate Räikkönen fifth. Montoya in sixth lost six-tenths of a second after Fisichella slowed his first timed lap. Trulli in seventh was slowed by a Jaguar car on his first lap. Fisichella in eighth expressed satisfaction with his car&#x27;s balance and performance. Massa was the highest-placed rookie in ninth after two errors. His teammate Heidfeld qualified tenth.

Button was the fastest driver who did not qualify in the top ten after being fourth early on. Panis completed one timed lap as he could not extract more performance from his BAR 004 and took 12th. Excess oversteer slowed his teammate Villeneuve in 13th. Salo, 14th, drove cautiously on his first timed lap. A minor fuel pressure fault limited Frentzen in 15th to one untroubled lap. McNish, 16th, had a set of tyres deducted from his qualifying allocation because Toyota erroneously used one set designated for Friday&#x27;s practice sessions on Saturday. A stoppage caught out Bernoldi at the start of his first timed lap and he qualified 17th. Webber took 18th and used wet-weather tyres. The two Jaguar R3 cars had a major aerodynamic deficiency and were 19th and 20th: A rear brake balance slowed Irvine and a handling deficiency saw de la Rosa drive the spare Jaguar. Yoong completed one timed lap for 21st. Five minutes in Sato&#x27;s spare Jordan EJ12 car stopped before Stewart turn with a hydraulic clutch problem that automatically selected third gear. The session was stopped for eight minutes to allow marshals to move his car. Sato returned to his garage and drove Fisichella&#x27;s race car but the rain made him more than 107 per cent slower than Barrichello.

=== Post-qualifying ===
Following qualifying, Jordan team principal and owner Eddie Jordan appealed to the stewards to allow Sato to run because he was under the 107 percent limit during free practice. They allowed him to race under &quot;exceptional circumstances,&quot; as in prior cases affected by changing weather.

===Qualifying classification===

;Notes
* – Takuma Sato set a time 107% slower than the fastest qualifying lap. He was granted permission from the stewards to start the race due to &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.

==Warm-up==

A half-hour warm-up session was held on Sunday morning in variable weather as heavy rain fell before it began. Teams used rain tyres and set-up their cars against the weather of the time. With a lap of 1:41.509, Michael Schumacher was fastest with teammate Barrichello 1.382 seconds slower in second. Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, Massa, Heidfeld, Fisichella, Trulli and Irvine made up positions three to ten. With 40 seconds to go, Salo drove off the racing line to allow Barrichello past into Ascari corner. He drove onto a white painted line, lost control of his Toyota and crashed into the barrier; Salo&#x27;s front wing detached heading towards an escape road.

==Race==
The weather at the start was dry and overcast with the air temperature between and the track temperature from . Sato drove the spare Jordan EJ12 car set up for his teammate Fisichella; after warm-up Jordan fixed an electrical problem that rendered its clutch inoperable. Before the race commenced at 14:00 local time before a crowd of 127,000 for 58 laps over a distance of , Frentzen and Bernoldi stalled their stationary cars; marshals and mechanics extricated them to the pit lane.

Ralf Schumacher used the outside grip to pass Michael Schumacher for second place and challenge Barrichello&#x27;s heavily fuelled Ferrari for the lead. As Michael Schumacher turned left to get the greatest possible approach into Brabham Corner, his teammate Barrichello switched lanes twice to try to prevent Ralf Schumacher, who responded by going to the centre in anticipation that momentum would give him the lead. Barrichello braked early for Brabham turn, catching out Ralf Schumacher, who struck the rear of Barrichello&#x27;s car at about . He launched over the Ferrari, grazed Barrichello&#x27;s helmet, careened and rested against the tyre wall in the run-off area upright. When Barrichello&#x27;s back wing was removed, his car spun broadside to a halt, causing an eight-car accident. His teammate Michael Schumacher and Räikkönen drove onto the grass to avoid a collision, as Massa cut the inside of the corner, and speared into Fisichella, the momentum collected Massa&#x27;s teammate Heidfeld and further causing Button, Panis and McNish to get caught up in the incident. Villeneuve, Salo, Webber, Irvine, de la Rosa, Yoong and Sato weaved through the crash scene. Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher were unhurt.

The drivers involved in the incident returned to the pit lane, anticipating that the race would be stopped and that they could drive their spare cars for a restart. However, the FIA race director, Charlie Whiting, did not stop the race and order a restart. He deployed the safety car with the damaged cars moved and debris cleared. This left Coulthard in the lead, followed by Trulli, Montoya, Michael Schumacher, Irvine and de la Rosa. At lap two&#x27;s conclusion, Räikkönen entered the pit lane for a 48-second pit stop for a new front wing and to remove debris lodged behind his back. Webber&#x27;s differential and traction control began to malfunction on lap three. On the same lap, Frentzen ignored a red light instructing drivers to stay in the pit lane until further notice and entered the circuit. The safety car was withdrawn when lap five ended and Coulthard led Trulli and Montoya. Going into Whiteford turn, Montoya drew close to Trulli and slid wide on oil laid on the circuit. This meant Michael Schumacher overtook Montoya for third. Further back, Räikkönen moved from eleventh to ninth.

Coulthard began to pull away from the rest of the field, increasing his lead to 4.5 seconds by lap seven. That same lap, Sato overtook de la Rosa for sixth, as Webber lost seventh to Räikkönen. At the back, Bernoldi rejoined the race after switching from his race car to the spare Arrows entry. Trulli blocked Michael Schumacher from passing him for second into Brabham corner on the eighth lap, allowing Montoya to gain on Schumacher; he was not close enough to affect a pass. There were overtakes further down the field: Räikkönen passed de la Rosa and Sato as Villeneuve overtook Webber for ninth. Trulli lost control of his Renault&#x27;s rear on oil at the exit of Jones turn on lap nine, breaking his suspension in a collision with the inside barrier. Because Trulli was stopped on the centre of the track, the safety car was deployed for the second time to allow marshals to move his car. When the safety car was withdrawn at the end of the 11th lap, an electrical fault distracted Coulthard, causing him to miss a gear change, lock his brakes, and understeer wide onto the grass entering Prost turn. He fell to fifth.

Michael Schumacher took the lead with Montoya second and Irvine third. Approaching Brabham corner Montoya&#x27;s higher straightline speed moved him past Michael Schumacher on the outside at the end of the main straight for the lead. Montoya then steered onto the inside to maintain the lead from Schumacher at Jones corner. Michael Schumacher had closed to within 0.8 seconds of passing Montoya by lap 13, but was unable to do so owing to slower traffic. Sato retired on lap 14 due to an unresolvable electronics issue that limited his gear selection. Michael Schumacher continued to pressure Montoya into an error, causing him to drive onto oil at Brabham Corner. He overtook Montoya on the inside as they exited Jones turn to take the lead to begin lap 17. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field as Montoya struggled to generate heat in his tyres. On lap 18, de la Rosa fell to eighth after Yoong, Webber and Villeneuve overtook him. On the following lap Frentzen was disqualified for his earlier transgression of ignoring the red light at the pit lane exit.

By lap 22 Michael Schumacher&#x27;s advantage over Montoya had grown to 11.3 seconds, with consecutive lap times in the 1:29 range. Räikkönen was 0.8 seconds behind Montoya. On the same lap, Coulthard went off the track at Prost corner. His slower speed promoted Irvine to fourth soon after. Bernoldi was disqualified from the race on lap 23 because the stewards determined he switched to the spare car after the race began. Webber and Villeneuve passed Coulthard for fifth and sixth on laps 25 and 26. Villeneuve in sixth had a rear wing failure, sending him into the tyre wall at high speed on the entry to Waite corner and retirement from his 100th race entry on lap 28. He was unhurt. On lap 29, Yoong overtook Coulthard for sixth. Seven laps later, Coulthard became the race&#x27;s final retirement when he pulled off to the side of track at Whiteford corner because his McLaren was stuck in sixth gear.

Webber was the first of the top six drivers to make a pit stop on lap 37. He had a problematic 34.9-second pit stop; the Minardi&#x27;s fuel cover did not open automatically and a mechanic used a screwdriver to unsecure it. Webber rejoined the track in sixth. Montoya and Michael Schumacher made their pit stops on laps 37 and 38. In the meantime, Räikkönen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:25.841 seconds on lap 37, as he sought to pass Montoya for second after his pit stop. He made his stop on lap 38. As Räikkönen drove onto the track, he drew alongside Montoya and carried excess speed into Brabham corner. He understeered wide onto the grass as he regained control of the rear of his car and fell to third, behind Montoya.

With the first four positions settled, attention switched to the battle for fifth between Webber and Salo. Webber short-shifted to avoid unnecessary car component stress when he noticed Salo closing up. He went faster and Minardi team owner Paul Stoddart radioed that he had to defend fifth from Salo, with Webber aware of a potential revenue bonus of $25 million for Minardi finishing ahead of Toyota in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Salo had seen the gap between himself and Webber and had closed it by the 57th lap. He attempted to pass Webber; Salo spun through 180 degrees on radiator coolant from Button&#x27;s car at Whiteford due to aerodynamic turbulence generated by airflow over Webber&#x27;s car and the latter&#x27;s block. He was able to restart his car and continue in sixth.

Michael Schumacher led the final 39 laps to take the 54th victory of his career. Montoya followed 18.628 seconds later in second. He was a further 6.4 seconds ahead of Räikkönen, who finished third for his first podium finish of his career. Irvine and Webber finished fourth and fifth after starting from 19th and 18th respectively. Salo took the final point in sixth place, the first time a team scored points in its debut race since JJ Lehto was fifth for Sauber at the 1993 South African Grand Prix. Yoong came seventh with a &quot;long&quot; brake pedal and a car optimised for wet-weather; marshals mistakenly waved blue flags at Yoong because they did not know which lap he was on. De la Rosa was the final classified finisher following a lengthy pit stop due to a misfiring engine. The attrition rate was high, with 8 of the 22 starters finishing the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Michael Schumacher called his battle with Montoya &quot;an interesting one&quot; and &quot;a bit back and forward&quot;, adding &quot;I think as well that the tyres played a little bit of a role in that; initially I struggled to get the temperature in where these guys seemed to get faster on top of temperatures but then it went the other way around, their tyres went off and my one came in so I had a nice chance to battle a little bit and finally got first position for us, which was ideal.&quot; Montoya said he enjoyed the battle and stated Ferrari had the fastest car, &quot;I think the conditions were not the best for the tyres. Hopefully in Malaysia it is going to be hotter, it could play into our hands a little bit.&quot; Räikkönen expressed astonishment at finishing third and mentioned how easy it was to overtake other cars, &quot;Some cars was more difficult and then it was helping me a lot big time because the safety car came out second time and I got behind the leaders and that was the main reason that I catch them, but it was quite a difficult and interesting race.&quot;

The Australian Grand Prix Corporation&#x27;s chairman, Ron Walker, convinced Webber and Stoddart to celebrate their fifth-place finish with an impromptu ceremony on the podium, which resulted in a £50,000 fine from FIA president Max Mosley. In a retrospective interview for &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot; in 2012, Stoddart called Webber&#x27;s fifth-place finish &quot;the most exciting two points in the history of Formula One&quot;. Webber commented on the result, &quot;Finishing the race fifth was unbelievable. We had people scaling catch fencing. Occupational health and safety would have gone ballistic these days. It was a unique day.&quot; The result saw Webber&#x27;s three-race contract with Minardi extended to the end of the season. The media compared Webber&#x27;s achievement to ice skater Steven Bradbury winning a gold medal in the men&#x27;s 1000 metres short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics; both men were successful after several participants crashed in their respective events.

Following their third collision in the previous two seasons, Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher were summoned to the stewards, who studied post-race television footage. Neither driver received a penalty and were given a warning. The stewards classed the crash as &quot;a racing incident&quot;, with neither competitor to blame. Michael Schumacher argued Barrichello braked earlier than normal, saying &quot;I was afraid to turn into the first corner because I suddenly saw cars flying next to me. I decided to go straight on and have a nice ride through the grass, which was a good decision, otherwise I guess I would have been hit.&quot; Barrichello said he was not to blame for the accident, &quot;If he wanted to overtake on the outside, he should have moved a lot further. I didn&#x27;t get in his way.&quot; Jackie Stewart, the three-time world champion, argued Ralf Schumacher had misjudged the braking distance for turn one, while Coulthard believed Barrichello caused the accident by braking earlier than usual.

Whiting&#x27;s decision not to stop the race after the eight-car crash was criticised. Jordan technical director Gary Anderson called it &quot;the most absurd thing I&#x27;ve seen in my life&quot;. Fisichella believed not stopping the race was &quot;ridiculous&quot;, and Michael Schumacher agreed it should have been stopped. Coulthard defended the decision, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that to deprive the spectators of a number of cars as a result of an incident at the first corner isn&#x27;t really good for the business. But this isn&#x27;t Hollywood. You don&#x27;t cut out the bits you don&#x27;t like. This is real. This is racing.&quot; Ralf Schumacher also backed Whiting&#x27;s ruling, noting &quot;Charlie Whiting took the right decision by not stopping the race. He had made it quite clear to us that he would not stop a race unless it was for safety reasons and that wasn&#x27;t the case.&quot;

Because this was the first race of the season, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points. Montoya was second with six points and Räikkönen was third with four. Irvine was fourth with three points and Webber was fifth with two points. Ferrari took the lead of the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with ten points. Williams were second with six points and McLaren followed in third with four points. With three points, Jaguar were fourth and Minardi fifth with two points with sixteen races left in the season.

<doc id="978911" wikidata="Q5158428" url="?curid=978911" title="Concepts of Modern Mathematics">
<text>Concepts of Modern Mathematics is a book by mathematician and science popularizer Ian Stewart about then-recent developments in mathematics. It was originally published by Penguin Books in 1975, updated in 1981, and reprinted by Dover publications in 1995 and 2015.

==Overview==
The book arose out of an extramural class that Ian Stewart taught at the University of Warwick about &quot;Modern mathematics&quot;. In the 1995 Dover edition Stewart wrote that the aim of the class was:

:&quot;to explain why the underlying abstract point of view had gained currency among research mathematicians, and to examine how it opened up entirely new realms of mathematical thought&quot;.

The book is aimed at non-mathematicians. However, there are frequent equations and diagrams and the level of presentation is more technical than some of Stewart&#x27;s other popular books such as &quot;Flatterland&quot;. Topics covered include analytic geometry, set theory, abstract algebra, group theory, topology, and probability.

<text>Modern Russian military ranks trace their roots to the Table of Ranks established by Peter the Great. Most of the rank names were borrowed from existing German/Prussian, French, English, Dutch, and Polish ranks upon the formation of the Russian regular army in the late 17th century.

== Russian Tsardom ==
The Kievan Rus had no standing army apart from small &quot;druzhina&quot; (), a permanent group of personal guards for the local knyaz (); an individual member of such a unit called a &quot;druzhinnik&quot; (). In times of war, the &quot;knyaz&quot; raised a militia comprising volunteers from the peasantry, and the &quot;druzhina&quot; served as the core of the troops. Each local knyaz served as the military leader of his troops. Such arrangements did not need permanent ranks or positions; they were created &quot;ad hoc&quot;, based on the task(s) at hand.

Upon the formation of &quot;Strelets troops&quot; in the mid-16th century, the low-level commanding officers were appointed to one of the following ranks:

* strelets (), a basic soldier
* desyatnik (), acting as sergeant/corporal
* sotnik (), acting as captain

These were not &quot;personal&quot; ranks and were retained only as long as the officer held the position. For battles, the &quot;knyaz&quot; organized his troops into temporary high-level units, usually a polk (полк, Old Slavonic for &quot;group of troops&quot;), a regiment commanded by a golova (голова́, &quot;head&quot;) or voyevoda (воево́да, &quot;war leader&quot;); these commanding positions were not permanent and did not persist after the battle. The cossack cavalry units had their own ranks of Kazak (коза́к), yesaul (есау́л) and ataman (атама́н); they were not comparable to the &quot;strelets&quot; ranks.

Upon the formation of standing regiments (&quot;prikaz&quot;, later polk) by Ivan IV, new ranks insinuated themselves into the hierarchy between the existing grades: pyatidesyatnik (пятидеся́тник, &quot;of fifty men&quot;) acting as lieutenant, golova acting as colonel of the regiment (also, &quot;tysyatskiy&quot; (ты́сяцкий, &#x27;of thousand men&#x27;). Later, a polugolova (полуголова́. &quot;half-golova&quot;) rank appeared; eventually &quot;golova&quot; was renamed polkovnik (полко́вник, &quot;of the polk&quot;), and &quot;polugolova&quot; was renamed podpolkovnik (sub-polkovnik). As usual, voyevoda was simply a &quot;commander&quot; of a large military group and not a rank of any kind.

Later, under the Romanov dynasty the companies of foreign mercenaries were formed; these incorporated the foreign ranks of Lieutenant and &quot;Rittmeister&quot;. They were later changed into the New Regiments of the Streltsy Troops and more Western ranks were adopted, including &quot;General&quot;. Finally, by 1680 the ranks of the New Regiments were unified with &quot;Strelets&quot; Troops.

== Russian Empire ==

During the beginning of the 18th century, military ranks were frequently changed by the tsar during efforts to reform the army and create a strong Navy. These many changes were routinely documented in the Army&#x27;s Rules of engagement since 1716 until they were finally incorporated into the first variant of Table of Ranks in 1722. Compared to Strelets Troops, a few more non-commissioned ranks were added, the soldier rank was replaced with many specialty ranks, and a few more General ranks were added. The naval ranks were created from scratch, ranks for the naval infantry and engineers would only come in the 19th century.

The officers were styled according to their rank as defined by the Table.

===1722–1917: Army===
By 1722, the ranks of both enlisted staff and commissioned/non-commissioned officers were somewhat settled; these ranks survived until the Russian Revolution with only minor adjustments.

&quot;Captain-Poruchik&quot; rank is comparable to &quot;Lieutenant Captain&quot;. Note that &quot;Poruchik&quot; can sometimes be styled as &quot;Porutchik&quot;, as it was originally written by the tsar himself.

Commissioned officers of artillery and engineers enjoyed a handicap of 1 grade, and the Leib Guards units enjoyed a handicap of 2 grades, ending in Life Guards Colonel.

In the 1798–1884 timeline, the General ranks were streamlined and the Brigadier rank was abolished. The Captain-Poruchik rank was reestablished again, this time as Staff-Captain. The Second Major and First Major ranks were united. In 1826, the Russian Army adopted shoulder insignia and distinct Cossack cavalry ranks.

In 1884, Major and Captain-Lieutenant ranks were abolished again and the ranks below were shifted several grades up. The latter was not reintroduced until 1907, but then again abolished in 1911.

=== 1722–1917: Navy ===
As stated earlier, most of the naval ranks and rates were formed from scratch in the 18th century, with many changes since then. Ranks for naval infantry, shore service personnel, and engineers would only come in the 19th century.



=== White Movement (1918-1921) ===

Although the White Movement generally retained the old imperial system, there were a few modifications. Most importantly, the ranks of praporshchik and lieutenant colonel were abolished as redundant by 1919.

== RSFSR and Soviet Union==

===1918–1925===
The October Revolution of 1917 abolished the privileges of the Russian nobility (Dvoryanstvo). The Table of Ranks was abolished and so were personal military ranks.
Based on the teachings of Karl Marx to replace a regular army with the general arming of the people, the Bolsheviks abolished the Imperial army on 16 March 1918. But the need for an armed struggle against the counter-revolution, and foreign military intervention forced the CEC and the CPC, January 15, 1918, to issue a decree establishing of the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Army&quot;, very early before the disbandment of the Imperial ground forces.

At first, the new army had no ranks, aside from the single rank of &quot;RedArmyMan&quot;. However, due to a real need, first informally and then more formally (although no document on an introduction of ranks or names of commanders was issued) in official correspondence acronyms began to appear representing position-holder titles. For example, &quot;komdiv&quot; was an acronym of &quot;Division Commander&quot;; likewise &quot;kombat&quot; stood for &quot;Battalion Commander&quot;, etc. By the middle of the civil war (January 1919), these &quot;positional ranks&quot; became quite formal, and since January 1920 the names of officers were fixed by the Order of the Red Army. Instead of ranks, these were officially known as &quot;categories of the Red Army.&quot; This system was maintained until May 1924. Some of these acronyms have survived as informal position names to the present day.

During the civil war, ships did not play a significant role. Many of the sailors and petty officers of the fleet went to fight on land in the Red Army. For a long time, a scale of naval ranks did not exist at all. Most of the naval officers were addressed either by their position or by their tsarist rank with the addition of the prefix &quot;byvshiy&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;b.&quot;), which meant &quot;former&quot;. In 1924, the real rehabilitation and creation of the fleet began. Personal ranks as such did not exist during this period in the Navy.

By then, the only new rank created was the Sergeant Major (Starshina) rank in the Red Army. It was first introduced in the Worker&#x27;s and Peasant&#x27;s Red Navy at the same time, with the old Imperial Naval rank of Bootsmann in the Navy the only old rank still used.

The Soviet Air Forces began as a committee for ex-Imperial military aviation in 1918 and was later transformed into a separate service as the Workers and Peasants Red Air Fleet. It shared the same ranks as the Army and the naval air component shared the ranks of its mother service.

===1925–1935===
By that year, the ranks were expanded to match the military ranks of other countries&#x27; armed forces. The Soviet Air Forces soon received its own ranks.

===1935–1940===
Personal ranks were formally introduced in the Red Army on September 22, 1935, including the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union which was adopted the year before.

Ranks of Junior Lieutenant and Junior Military Technician were introduced in 1937. Also restored were most of the military officer ranks in the Army and Navy, except for the General officer ranks and the Admiral officer ranks, with the naval rank of 3rd-class Captain being the new officer rank introduced.

===1940–1943===
General ranks were restored in May 1940. The new ranks were based on the military ranks of the Russian Empire, although they underwent some modifications; modified Imperial rank insignia were reintroduced in 1943. The new ranks also abolished the specialist ranks for the other arms and services, and they were replaced by the new ranks with the service name attached. 

Ranks &quot;Lieutenant Colonel&quot; and &quot;Senior Battalion Commissar&quot; were introduced in 1937. By 1940 the Army rank of Corporal and the Naval rank of Midshipman were revived, and the old rank of Junior Sergeant was reinstated into its modern form (the rank is from the Estonian Army but has a Russian origin in the Imperial Russian Army).

In 1942, the political commissars&#x27; service in the Red Army was finally disbanded for good, and its ranks dissolved.

===1943–1991===
In 1943, all ranks became standardized throughout the Soviet Armed Forces, with the full inclusion of Air/Arm/Branch Marshal and Air/Arm/Branch Chief Marshal ranks. All specialist ranks remaining were replaced by the 1940 standard ranks with the service name attached to them, and Private and Seaman became the basic enlisted ranks. The new Imperial Russian Armed Forces-style shoulder rank insignia also debuted.

From 1943 to 1961, naval ranks were adjusted to match the naval ranks of other countries. The rank of Admiral of the Fleet was introduced during the Great Patriotic War and was the equivalent rank to Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1955; it was renamed Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union. The rank was soon revived in 1962 as a General of the Army-equivalent rank in compliance with new Soviet Navy regulations for officers.

On June 27, 1945, the rank of Generalissimus Sovietskogo Soyuza (Generalissimo of the Soviet Union) was created and granted to Joseph Stalin following the tradition of the Russian Imperial Army which granted to the Tsars the military rank in their capacity as Commanders-in-Chief. Formally it existed until 1993 but it was never used after Stalin&#x27;s death.

In the 1970s, the non-commissioned officers serving under contract and holding Starshina (Master Sergeant) rank were reassigned to newly created Praporshchik rank (not to be confused with similarly named Russian Empire rank of commissioned officers); &quot;starshina&quot; was reserved for conscripts only. In the Soviet Navy, however, as the Midshipman rank was formally elevated to that of a warrant officer, the NCO role of Midshipmen was replaced by the new rank of Ship Chief Master Sergeant as a result of the naval rank change. At the same time all rank insignia became uniform for the Army and Air Force plus the other services, the Navy retained theirs.

Generals of the Army and Admirals soon had their insignia changed in 1974.

The final change was in 1981 when Senior Praporshchik and Senior Midshipman ranks were added to the ranks of warrant officers.

The table of Soviet military ranks can be seen in military ranks of the Soviet Union or in the section below (as they were the same as the present military ranks of the Russian Federation).

==Russian Federation==
The independent Russia inherited the ranks of the Soviet Union, although the insignia and uniforms were altered a little. The following is a table of ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

Russian armed forces have two styles of ranks: deck ranks (navy style ranks) and troop ranks (army and other forces style ranks). The following table of Ranks is based on those of the Russian Federation.

Troop ranks are used by:
* Ministry of Defence
** Ground Forces (Army)
** Aerospace Forces
** Navy — Naval Infantry (Marines), Naval Aviation other various shore services of the navy
** Special Operations Forces
** Strategic Importance Missile Troops (Independent Corps)
** Airborne Troops (Independent Corps)
** Federal Agency of Special Construction
** Railway Troops of the Russian Federation
** Rear of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation
* Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD)
** Police, formerly Militia
* National Guard of Russia
** National Guard Forces Command
* Federal Security Service (FSB) and
** Border Service of the FSB
* Federal Protective Service (FSO)
* Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)
* Chief directorate of special programs of the President
* Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM)
** Civil Defense Troops
** Military personnel of the Russian State Fire Service

Deck (Navy) ranks are used by:
* Ministry of Defence
** Navy — deck personnel
* Federal Security Service
** Coast Guard of the Border Service of FSB
* National Guard
** National Guard Naval Service Corps

The highest troop rank is Marshal of the Russian Federation.

The highest Navy &#x27;deck&#x27; rank is Admiral of the Fleet. In the Soviet era the rank &quot;Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union&quot; was equivalent to the rank of Marshal and only three persons were given that rank. Since 1991 this rank is no longer used.

Ranks can have additional descriptors according to assignment or status. For example, the rank of a serviceman of a &quot;Guards&quot; unit, formation, or ship may be followed by the word &quot;Guards&quot; (&quot;Gefreitor of Guards&quot;); the rank of a serviceman of the legal, medical, or veterinary professions is followed by &quot;of Justice&quot;, &quot;of the Medical service&quot;, or &quot;of the Veterinary service&quot; (&quot;Captain of the Medical Service&quot;); and the rank of a reserve or retired serviceman is followed by the words “Reserve” or “Retired,” respectively (&quot;Major of Reserve&quot;). The Russian Federation abolished the descriptor &quot;of Aviation&quot; for pilots, however, that descriptor is still in common use.
Note: the descriptor &quot;of Aviation&quot; has been officially abolished but usage is still common within the Air Force and Naval Aviation.

On March 11, 2010, by Law No.2010-293 of the President of Russia, a new set of rank insignia debuted. Privates, Airmen, and Seamen sport plain shoulder epaulets and the chevrons are removed for the ranks of senior NCOs and are now replaced by plain bars (small horizontal from Corporal/Senior Airman/Leading Seaman to Sergeant/Staff Sergeant/Petty Officer increasing by seniority, large horizontal for Staff Sergeants, Flight Sergeants, and Chief Petty Officers, and vertical bars for petty officers and Ship CPOs).

WO&#x27;s and Officer ranks received updated shoulder rank epaulets (and for the Navy, cuff rank insignia), and all General Officer and Flag Officer rank insignia now reflecting service affiliation in the duty dress uniform (the old pattern epaulets were replaced by the army green, aerospace forces blue and navy blue epaulets (duty dress depending on service) and gold (parade dress) epaulets similar to those used in the mid-1970s by the Soviet Armed Forces). This was also the case for the Marshal of the Russian Federation rank epaulet, which still retained the Coat of arms of Russia and the Marshal&#x27;s Star. But this change is now evident in the battle dress and duty uniforms only, in the new 2008 dress uniforms the change is evident in the enlisted and NCO epaulets, but in the epaulets of all warrant officers and officers, the gold and black epaulets stayed as is in the dress uniforms.

As part of the 2008 Russian military reform, the Praporshchik (Warrant Officer) rank was effectively abolished in the Russian Armed Forces, though the rank still may be used in other uniformed services of the government such as the Interior Ministry, the Police, The Ministry of Emergency Situations and the Border Guard Service.

The general and flag officer ranks changed again on February 22, 2013. Thus, for Generals of the Army and Fleet Admirals, instead of sporting 4 stars, the shoulder rank insignia for both were changed back to the Marshal&#x27;s Star with additional emblems for Generals of the Army and Fleet Admiral&#x27;s Star for Fleet Admirals. Some retired generals and flag officers were spotted wearing the old pre-1994 rank insignia instead of the new.

<doc id="978913" wikidata="Q898288" url="?curid=978913" title="Brittleness">
<text>A material is brittle if, when subjected to stress, it fractures with little elastic deformation and without significant plastic deformation. Brittle materials absorb relatively little energy prior to fracture, even those of high strength. Breaking is often accompanied by a sharp snapping sound.

When used in materials science, it is generally applied to materials that fail when there is little or no plastic deformation before failure. One proof is to match the broken halves, which should fit exactly since no plastic deformation has occurred.

==Brittleness in different materials==
===Polymers===
Mechanical characteristics of polymers can be sensitive to temperature changes near room temperatures. For example, poly(methyl methacrylate) is extremely brittle at temperature 4˚C, but experiences increased ductility with increased temperature. 

Amorphous polymers are polymers that can behave differently at different temperatures. They may behave like a glass at low temperatures (the glassy region), a rubbery solid at intermediate temperatures (the leathery or glass transition region), and a viscous liquid at higher temperatures (the rubbery flow and viscous flow region). This behavior is known as viscoelastic behavior. In the glassy region, the amorphous polymer will be rigid and brittle. With increasing temperature, the polymer will become less brittle.

===Metals===
Some metals show brittle characteristics due to their slip systems. The more slip systems a metal has, the less brittle it is, because plastic deformation can occur along many of these slip systems. Conversely, with fewer slip systems, less plastic deformation can occur, and the metal will be more brittle. For example, HCP (hexagonal close packed) metals have few active slip systems, and are typically brittle.

===Ceramics===
Ceramics are generally brittle due to the difficulty of dislocation motion, or slip. There are few slip systems in crystalline ceramics that a dislocation is able to move along, which makes deformation difficult and makes the ceramic more brittle. 

Ceramic materials generally exhibit ionic bonding. Because of the ions’ electric charge and their repulsion of like-charged ions, slip is further restricted.

==Changing brittle materials==
Materials can be changed to become more brittle or less brittle.

===Toughening===
When a material has reached the limit of its strength, it usually has the option of either deformation or fracture. A naturally malleable metal can be made stronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation (reducing grain size, precipitation hardening, work hardening, etc.), but if this is taken to an extreme, fracture becomes the more likely outcome, and the material can become brittle. Improving material toughness is, therefore, a balancing act.

Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are not difficult to toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb the tip of a propagating crack or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral. The polyvinyl butyral, as a viscoelastic polymer, absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by Prince Rupert&#x27;s Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.

A different philosophy is used in composite materials, where brittle glass fibers, for example, are embedded in a ductile matrix such as polyester resin. When strained, cracks are formed at the glass–matrix interface, but so many are formed that much energy is absorbed and the material is thereby toughened. The same principle is used in creating metal matrix composites.

===Effect of pressure===
Generally, the &quot;brittle strength&quot; of a material can be increased by pressure. This happens as an example in the brittle–ductile transition zone at an approximate depth of in the Earth&#x27;s crust, at which rock becomes less likely to fracture, and more likely to deform ductilely (see rheid).

==Crack growth==
Supersonic fracture is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a brittle material. This phenomenon was first discovered by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart (Markus J. Buehler and Huajian Gao) and IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California (Farid F. Abraham).

<doc id="978916" wikidata="Q1060653" url="?curid=978916" title="Customer service">
<text>[[Customer]] service is the assistance and advice provided by a company through phone, online chat, mail, and e-mail to those who buy or use its products or services. Each industry requires different levels of customer service, but towards the end, the idea of a well-performed service is that of increasing revenues. The perception of success of the customer service interactions is dependent on employees &quot;who can adjust themselves to the personality of the customer&quot;. Customer service is often practiced in a way that reflects the strategies and values of a firm. Good quality customer service is usually measured through customer retention. 

Customer service for some firms is part of the firm’s intangible assets and can differentiate it from others in the industry. One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization. It is expected that AI-based chatbots will significantly impact customer service and call centre roles and will increase productivity substantially. Many organisations have already adopted AI chatbots to improve their customer service experience.

The evolution in the service industry has identified the needs of consumers. Companies usually create policies or standards to guide their personnel to follow their particular service package. A service package is a combination of tangible and intangible characteristics a firm uses to take care of its clients.

==Customer support==

Customer support is a range of consumer services to assist customers in making cost-effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product. These services may even be provided at the place in which the customer makes use of the product or service. In this case, it is called &quot;at home customer service&quot; or &quot;at home customer support.&quot; Customer support is an effective strategy that ensures that the customer&#x27;s needs have been attended to. Customer support helps ensure that the products and services that have been provided to the customer meet their expectations. Given an effective and efficient customer support experience, customers tend to be loyal to the organization, which creates a competitive advantage over its competitors. Organizations should ensure that any complaints from customers about customer support have been dealt with effectively.

==Automation and productivity increase== 
Customer service may be provided in person (e.g. sales / service representative), or by automated means, such as kiosks, websites, and apps. An advantage of automation is that it can provide service 24 hours a day which can complement face-to-face customer service. There is also economic benefit to the firm. Through the evolution of technology, automated services become less expensive over time. This helps provide services to more customers for a fraction of the cost of employees&#x27; wages. Automation can facilitate customer service or replace it entirely.

A popular type of automated customer service is done through artificial intelligence (AI). The customer benefit of AI is the feel for chatting with a live agent through improved speech technologies while giving customers the self-service benefit. AI can learn through interaction to give a personalized service. The exchange the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates within devices, lets us transfer data when we need it, where we need it. Each gadget catches the information it needs while it maintains communication with other devices. This is also done through advances in hardware and software technology. Another form of automated customer service is touch-tone phone, which usually involves IVR (Interactive Voice Response) a main menu and the use of a keypad as options (e.g. &quot;Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Spanish&quot;).

In the Internet era, a challenge is to maintain and/or enhance the personal experience while making use of the efficiencies of online commerce. &quot;Online customers are literally invisible to you (and you to them), so it&#x27;s easy to shortchange them emotionally. But this lack of visual and tactile presence makes it even more crucial to create a sense of personal, human-to-human connection in the online arena.&quot;
Examples of customer service by artificial means are automated online assistants that can be seen as avatars on websites, which enterprises can use to reduce operating and training costs. These are driven by chatbots, and a major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing. 

==Metrics== 
The two primary methods of gathering feedback are customer surveys and Net Promoter Score measurement, used for calculating the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer.

==Instant feedback==
Many outfits have implemented feedback loops that allow them to capture feedback at point of experience. For example, National Express in the UK has invited passengers to send text messages while riding the bus. This has been shown to be useful, as it allows companies to improve their customer service before the customer defects, thus making it far more likely that the customer will return next time.

<doc id="978919" wikidata="Q1849476" url="?curid=978919" title="List of Orchidaceae genera">
<text>This is a list of genera in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), originally according to The Families of Flowering Plants - L. Watson and M. J. Dallwitz. This list is adapted regularly with the changes published in the &quot;Orchid Research Newsletter&quot; which is published twice a year by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The most up to date list of accepted genera, natural nothogenera, species and natural nothospecies with their synonyms can be found on the World Checklist of Selected Plants Families Search Page and Plants of the World Online published by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. This list is reflected on Wikispecies and the new eMonocot website Orchidaceae Juss.

This taxonomy undergoes constant change, mainly through evidence from DNA study. Orchids were traditionally defined by morphological similarity (structure of their flowers and other parts). However, recent changes to nomenclature have been driven primarily by DNA studies and also by re-examination of herbarium specimens. This has led to a reduction of genera and species as well as re-circumscription of subfamilies, tribes and subtribes. Orchid taxonomy is still being revised and each year about another 150 new species are being discovered. The list of genera alone currently stands just short of 1000 entries.

From a cladistic point of view, the orchid family is considered to be monophyletic, i.e. the group incorporates all the taxa derived from an ancestral group.

The taxonomy of the orchids is explained on the page Taxonomy of the orchid family.

== Subfamilies ==
There are five recognized subfamilies:
* Apostasioideae (two genera, &quot;Neuwiedia&quot; and &quot;Apostasia&quot;)
* Cypripedioideae (five genera: &quot;Cypripedium&quot;, &quot;Mexipedium&quot;, &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; and &quot;Selenipedium&quot; 
* Epidendroideae (has 15,000 species in 576 genera)
* Orchidoideae (7 tribes and 3,630 species; has 2 subclades with tribes Orchideae and Diseae then the other has tribes Cranichideae, Chloraeeae and Diurideae)
* Vanilloideae (15 genera and about 180 species: Tribe Pogonieae (77 species; &quot;Cleistes&quot;, &quot;Cleistesiopsis&quot;, &quot;Duckeella&quot;, &quot;Isotria&quot;, and &quot;Pogonia&quot;) also Tribe Vanilleae (with 172 species; &quot;Clematepistephium&quot;, &quot;Cyrtosia&quot;, &quot;Epistephium&quot;, &quot;Eriaxis&quot;, &quot;Erythrorchis&quot;, &quot;Galeola&quot;, &quot;Lecanorchis&quot;, &quot;Pseudovanilla&quot; and &quot;Vanilla&quot;)

<text>Sheikh Yusuf Estes (born: Joseph Estes, 1944), is an American Islamic preacher and chaplain from Texas. Estes converted from Christianity to Islam in 1991. He served as a Muslim chaplain for the United States Bureau of Prisons during the 1990s, and as a delegate to the United Nations World Peace Conference for Religious Leaders held at the UN in September 2000.

Estes has served as a guest presenter and a keynote speaker at various Islamic events. Estes was named as the Islamic Personality of the Year at the Dubai International Holy Quran Award ceremony on 8 August 2012.

Estes is the founder and president of Guide US TV, a free-to-air Internet and satellite TV channel, which broadcasts programs about Islam. In 2010 Estes was list as one of the top 500 most influential Muslims.

In November 2017, Estes was denied entry into Singapore for having expressed views which were deemed by the Ministry of Home Affairs as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;contrary&quot; to the values of Singapore&#x27;s multiracial and multi-religious society for advising Muslims against celebrating Christmas and Hannukah, which goes against the Islamic faith. This was the basis used for the prevention of entry alleging his &quot;divisive views breed intolerance and exclusivist practices that will damage social harmony, and cause communities to drift apart,&quot; according to the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs. This resulted in criticism as Estes planned to enter Singapore as a tourist and not as a speaker and that people could make such judgements for themselves.

<doc id="978925" wikidata="Q441330" url="?curid=978925" title="Jens Otto Krag">
<text>Jens Otto Krag (; 15 September 1914 – 22 June 1978) was a Danish politician, who served as the prime minister of Denmark from 1962 to 1968 and again from 1971 to 1972, and as leader of the Social Democrats from 1962 to 1972. He was president of the Nordic Council in 1971.

== Early life and career ==
Krag was born on 15 September 1914 in Randers, Jutland, into the impoverished family of a tobacconist. Krag attended the local gymnasium, and as a teenager, he joined the Social Democratic Youth of Denmark, the youth wing of Social Democratic Party. In 1933, Krag began studying economics at the University of Copenhagen. During this period, he emerged as an active journalist and teacher in the labour movement, and became acquainted with the leadership of the Social Democrats and the trade unions.

Following the Nazi invasion of Denmark, Krag received his degree in 1940. During the Nazi occupation, Krag worked as a civil servant in a Danish government agency and became a leading economic advisor to the labour movement, as well as a protégé of prominent social democrat and future prime minister Hans Hedtoft.

== Political career ==
In 1944, Krag began his political career as the secretary of a program committee set up by the Social Democratic Party, as it prepared itself for politics in the post-war period. Under his leadership, the committee developed the new party program &quot;Denmark of the Future&quot; (), which presented proposals for nationalisation and notions of Keynesian economics and economic democracy. Despite the party&#x27;s poor performance in the first post-war election in 1945, Krag and new party program of the Social Democrats achieved notoriety in Danish politics under Vilheim Buhl&#x27;s cabinet.

=== Member of Folketing ===
Krag was elected to Parliament (Folketing) in 1947 and was appointed Minister of Commerce. He supported the strengthening of the Danish military and Danish membership of NATO in 1949.

In 1950, Krag resigned from Parliament partially due to a conflict with Vilhelm Buhl and H. C. Hansen and, in order to become more fluent in the English language and see more of the world, requested a position at the Danish embassy in the United States. He received the position, and was in America until 1953 when he was re-elected to parliament and became a minister without portfolio. He was minister of the new department of foreign economic affairs from 1953 until 1958 and Foreign Minister from 1958 until 1962.

=== Prime minister ===
In September 1962 he succeeded Viggo Kampmann as prime minister and leader of the Danish Social Democratic Party. He was prime minister until February 1968 when the Social Democrats lost power. He became prime minister again in 1971 when his party returned to power. Less than a year into his first term as prime minister, the opposition held a referendum which rejected a set of land laws already passed by Krag&#x27;s government.

During his second term as prime minister, Krag campaigned particularly for European cooperation and unity. He sponsored a referendum for Denmark to join the European Economic Community. In 1972 the referendum passed, but the nation was divided over the issue, and Krag resigned, claiming that he had become tired of politics. His last role in public life was as the European Common Market representative to the United States from 1974 until 1975.

In social policy, a number of progressive reforms were implemented during Krag&#x27;s time as prime minister. Under the New Care of Children and Juveniles Act of May 1964, local child and juvenile welfare committees were authorized to grant cash benefits to certain families with children, to avoid placing children in the care of the Municipal Social Welfare Offices. New criteria for day-care institutions stressing social, educational, and therapeutic aspects were also introduced, and municipalities were obliged to provide facilities for day-care and other related services. Under the Employment Service and Unemployment Insurance Act of February 1967, unemployment benefits were raised and indexed to the official wage index and waiting times were abolished. In addition, an accident insurance act of December 1964 indexed benefits. The Basic Education Act of April 1972 extended compulsory basic education from 7 to 9 years. while A law passed in June 1972 introduced a new scheme for daily cash benefits in cases of sickness and maternity. In 1964, a supplementary pension scheme was established, together with universal child allowances in 1967.

== Personal life ==
Krag had a difficult personal life. He married two times, with two marriages ending in divorce, largely due to his own infidelity.

In 1950, he married his first wife, Swedish actress Birgit Tengroth. They officially divorced in 1952 after two years marriage; the couple had no children. Seven years later, he was married his second wife, Danish actress Helle Virkner (1925–2009) from 1959 until their divorce in 1973. The couple had two children, Jens Christian (son) (born 1960) and Astrid Helene &quot;Søsser&quot; (daughter) (1962–2014), as well as another child outside of wedlock (Peter Hansted). During his time in politics, Krug struggled with alcoholism, an addiction that became more pronounced after his retirement.

Krag was an atheist.

== Death and legacy ==
Krag died of congestive heart failure at his home in Skiveren, Ålbæk, Denmark, at the age of 63.

In Denmark, Krag is widely recognized as one of the greatest Danish politicians of all time. He was in the front line of politics for 25 years, holding high ministerial offices for most of that time. He managed to raise Denmark&#x27;s profile on the world stage, striking up strong relationships with fellow European leaders as well as American presidents Kennedy and Johnson. His list of political achievements is also one of the most impressive, overseeing one of the longest periods of economic expansion in Danish history. However, his largest achievement, and the one he himself was most proud of, was taking Denmark into the European Economic Community in 1973. With that task accomplished he felt he could retire at a high point.

Krag was at one and the same time one of the most charismatic and withdrawn Danish politicians ever. He never enjoyed the attention to which he had to subject himself, and many people found him rather arrogant. According to his most thorough (and quite sympathetic) biographer (Bo Lidegaard, &quot;Krag I-II&quot;, 2001/2002), he never truly settled into the role as a politician, always considering himself on the way &quot;to somewhere else.&quot; He had always dreamed of holding the position of governor of the National Bank of Denmark. Only when he had definitively quit politics in 1972 did he realise that he would not be able to achieve this goal.

In the Danish TV series &quot;Krøniken&quot; (2004–2006), he was portrayed by the actor Lars Mikkelsen.

<text>National Velvet are a Canadian goth rock band, popular in the 1980s and 1990s. They took their name from the 1944 movie starring Elizabeth Taylor.

The band members have included vocalist Maria Del Mar, guitarist Mark Crossley, guitarist Mich Gzowski, drummer Ken Sinclair, guitarist Tim Welch, bassist Mark Storm (born Mark Erickson), saxophonist Chris Reis and drummer Garry Flint. 

The band came together after a chance meeting between Del Mar and Storm in an alley during a party in Toronto, Ontario; that initial meeting was actually an argument about musical taste, because Storm was a fan of gothic rock bands such as Bauhaus, while Del Mar was into Spanish classical music, Motown, swing music and punk rock. Mark introduced Maria to some friends that were looking to start a band. Maria Del Mar worked the coat check at Toronto nightclub The Diamond, while Tim Welch was the lighting technician there. They began playing the local Toronto circuit, they used the money they made to record a 4-track demo. They shopped the demos around to record labels, but grew impatient. Six months after forming, they released a self-titled independent EP, which they sold at their shows. Their EP caught the attention of Capitol Records President, Dean Cameron. He was impressed and signed them to Capital affiliate Intrepid Records in 1987. Original members, Sinclair, Gzowski and Reis had left the band prior to the Capitol deal and Gary Flint was added.

Their self-titled debut album was released in 1988, and spawned the radio single &quot;Flesh Under Skin&quot;. In 1989, their single and video for &quot;68 Hours&quot; garnered them a CASBY Award. &quot;Pacifist At Risk&quot; and &quot;Change My Mind&quot; were also released as singles but failed to make the charts.

Their follow-up album, &quot;Courage&quot; was recorded in England with producer Zeus B. Held, and was released in 1990. Guitarist Tim Welch (formerly of Images In Vogue) was added as a full time band member. The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour, and gave the band further radio airplay for the singles &quot;Shine On&quot; and &quot;Sex Gorilla&quot;. (The latter title was a band in-joke. The song had actually been written as &quot;Sarsparilla&quot;, but the fans kept misunderstanding the lyrics, so the band relented and retitled the song.) &quot;Sex Gorilla&quot; also led to a fan tradition of throwing bananas at the stage during their shows.
Sex Gorilla and Shine On were played in heavy rotation on Much Music and MTV. Courage was certified gold. A third single, &quot;A Place Called Hysteria&quot; was released off the album but received little push from the record label. The band continued to tour for the next few years, mainly in smaller clubs around Ontario, Canada.

The band subsequently left Capitol Records, and released their third and final album &quot;Wildseed&quot; in 1995 on the independent label Iron Music. The album was recorded at eNVy Studio and produced by Gary Flint. Guitarist Darrell Flint was added, replacing Mark Storm. The album received little attention and almost no airplay. 

In 1996, Maria Del Mar joined the all female band Hassenpfeffer and recorded an album &#x27;Songs of Convenience&#x27; (MaGaDa International).

Despite frequent confusion, Del Mar is not the same person as television actress Maria del Mar. To further confusion, Maria Del Mar (singer) has done some acting, including the 1991 Toronto indie film &quot;The Events Leading Up to My Death&quot;, directed by Bill Robertson.

Maria continued to work in the Toronto music scene into the early 2000&#x27;s, including gigs with Classic Albums Live and with the Rolling Stones tribute band Midnight Ramblers.

Storm was reported missing in November 2002. The following June, his body was found in Lake Ontario. The band got together in 2003 for a benefit concert to help Mark&#x27;s family during the difficult time.

The band has performed periodically, including shows at Toronto&#x27;s Bovine Sex Club in 2011 and 2012, and continue to perform at select venues.

<text>The &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class cruisers were a class of eight oil-fired light cruisers of the Royal Navy all ordered in September 1912, primarily for service in the North Sea. They had three funnels with the middle one somewhat larger in diameter than the others. All served in the First World War. They were found to be very cramped internally.

==Design and description==
The earlier scout cruisers were too slow to accomplish their intended duties of working with destroyer flotillas and defending the fleet against attacks by enemy destroyers. The primary emphasis of the &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class cruisers was a design speed of , to allow them to lead destroyers in combat. In support of this goal, they were the first cruisers to use destroyer-type high-speed steam turbines and oil-fired boilers were chosen to save weight and increase their power to meet the specification. They retained the side protection introduced in the later ships of the previous , but reverted to a mixed main armament that was a feature of the earlier ships of that class.

The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a deep draught of . Displacement was at normal and at full load. The &quot;Arethusa&quot; class were powered by four direct-drive steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of and gave a speed of about . The six ships that used Parsons turbines were equipped with cruising turbines on the outer shafts, but the two ships that used Brown-Curtis turbines were not so fitted. The turbines used steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers at a working pressure of . They carried tons of fuel oil that gave the ships with cruising turbines a range of and for those without, both at .

The main armament of the &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class ships was two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and six QF 4-inch Mk V guns in waist mountings. They were also fitted with a single QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft gun and four  torpedo tubes in two twin mounts.

<doc id="978934" wikidata="Q377571" url="?curid=978934" title="Volcán Atitlán">
<text>Volcán Atitlán () is a large, conical, active stratovolcano adjacent to the caldera of Lake Atitlán in the Guatemalan Highlands of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas range. It is within the Sololá Department, in southwestern Guatemala.

The volcano has been quite active historically, with more than a dozen eruptions recorded between 1469 and 1853, the date of its most recent eruption. Atitlán is part of the Central American Volcanic Arc. The arc is a chain of volcanoes stretching along Central America formed by subduction of the Cocos Plate underneath the Caribbean Plate. These volcanoes are part of the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean.

Volcán Atitlán is a few miles south of Volcán Tolimán, which rises from the southern shore of Lake Atitlán. Volcán San Pedro rises above Lake Atitlán northwest of Volcán Atitlán. A long narrow bay separates Volcán Atitlán and Volcán Toliman from Volcán San Pedro.

== Wildlife ==
Atitlán is home to two particularly rare and beautiful birds that are endemic to the cloud forests of this region. The horned guan (&quot;Oreophasis derbianus&quot;) is a Pleistocene relic of the family Cracidae that persists today only in small fragments of its previous range. Its habitat is limited to cloud forests above approximately . This bird is the size of a turkey and the adult male has a one-inch scarlet-colored &quot;horn&quot; projecting straight up from the top of its head. The Cabanis&#x27;s or azure-rumped tanager (&quot;Tangara cabanisi&quot;) is probably the most restricted-range species in the region. It occurs only at mid-elevations within the Sierra Madre del Sur of Chiapas, Mexico and western Guatemala.

<doc id="978938" wikidata="Q273276" url="?curid=978938" title="Lake Atitlán">
<text>Lake Atitlán (, ) is a lake in the Guatemalan Highlands of the Sierra Madre mountain range. The lake is located in the Sololá Department of southwestern Guatemala. It is known as the deepest lake in Central America.

==Name==
Atitlán means &quot;between the waters&quot;. In the Nahuatl language, &quot;atl&quot; is the word for water, and &quot;titlan&quot; means between. The &quot;tl&quot; at the end of the word &quot;atl&quot; is dropped (because it is a grammatical suffix) and the words are combined to form &quot;Atitlán&quot;.

==Geography==
The lake has a maximum depth of about and an average depth of . Its surface area is . It is approximately with around of water. Atitlán is an endorheic lake, fed by two nearby rivers and not draining into the ocean. It is shaped by deep surrounding escarpments and three volcanoes on its southern flank. The lake basin is volcanic in origin, filling an enormous caldera formed by a supervolcanic eruption 84,000 years ago. The culture of the towns and villages surrounding Lake Atitlán is influenced by the Maya people. The lake is about west-northwest of Antigua. It should not be confused with the smaller Lake Amatitlán.

Lake Atitlán is renowned as one of the most beautiful lakes in the world, and is one of Guatemala&#x27;s most important national and international tourist attractions. German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt called it &quot;the most beautiful lake in the world,&quot; and Aldous Huxley famously wrote of it in his 1934 travel book &quot;Beyond the Mexique Bay&quot;: &quot;Lake Como, it seems to me, touches on the limit of permissibly picturesque, but Atitlán is Como with additional embellishments of several immense volcanoes. It really is too much of a good thing.&quot;

The area around San Marcos has particularly tall cliffs abutting the lake and in recent years has become renowned for cliff diving.

==Agriculture==
The area supports extensive coffee and avocado orchards and a variety of farm crops, most notably corn and onions. Significant agricultural crops include: corn, onions, beans, squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic, chile verde, strawberries and pitahaya fruit. The lake itself is a significant food source for the largely indigenous population.

==Geological history==

The first volcanic activity in the region occurred about 11 million years ago, and since then the region has seen four separate episodes of volcanic growth and caldera collapse, the most recent of which began about 1.8 million years ago and culminated in the formation of the present caldera. The lake now fills a large part of the caldera, reaching depths of up to .

The caldera-forming eruption is known as Los Chocoyos eruption and ejected up to of tephra. The enormous eruption dispersed ash over an area of some : it has been detected from Florida to Ecuador, and can be used as a stratigraphic marker in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (known as Y-8 ash in marine deposits). A &quot;chocoyo&quot; is a type of bird which is often found nesting in the relatively soft ash layer.

Since the end of Los Chocoyos, continuing volcanic activity has built three volcanoes in the caldera. Volcán Atitlán lies on the southern rim of the caldera, while Volcán San Pedro and Volcán Tolimán lie within the caldera. San Pedro is the oldest of the three and seems to have stopped erupting about 40,000 years ago. Tolimán began growing after San Pedro stopped erupting and probably remains active, although it has not erupted in historic times. Atitlán has developed almost entirely in the last 10,000 years and remains active, its most recent eruption having occurred in 1853.

On February 4, 1976, a very large earthquake (magnitude 7.5) struck Guatemala, killing more than 26,000 people. The earthquake fractured the lake bed and caused subsurface drainage from the lake, allowing the water level to drop within one month.

==Ecological history==
In 1955, the area around Lake Atitlán became a national park. The lake was mostly unknown to the rest of the world, and Guatemala was seeking ways to increase tourism and boost the local economy. It was suggested by Pan American World Airways that stocking the lake with a fish prized by anglers would be a way to do just that. As a result, an exotic non-native species, the black bass, was introduced into the lake in 1958. The bass quickly took to its new home and caused a radical change in the species composition of the lake. The predatory bass caused the elimination of more than two-thirds of the native fish species in the lake and contributed to the extinction of the Atitlan grebe, a rare bird that lived only in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán.

A unique aspect of the climate is what is referred to as Xocomil (of the Kaqchickel language meaning &quot;the wind that carried away sin&quot;). This wind is common late morning and afternoon across the lake; it is said to be the encounter of warm winds from Pacific meeting colder winds from the North. The winds can result in violent water turbulence, enough to capsize boats.

In August 2015 a thick bloom of algae known as Microcystis cyanobacteria re-appeared in Lake Atitlan; the first major occurrence was in 2009. Bureaucratic red tape has been blamed for the lack of action to save the lake. If current activities continue unchecked, the toxification of the lake will make it unsuitable for human use.

==Culture==

The lake is surrounded by many villages in which Maya culture is still prevalent and traditional dress is worn. The Maya people of Atitlán are predominantly Tz&#x27;utujil and Kaqchikel. During the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the Kaqchikel initially allied themselves with the invaders to defeat their historic enemies, the Tz&#x27;utujil and K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya, but were themselves conquered and subdued when they refused to pay tribute to the Spanish.

Santiago Atitlán is the largest of the lakeside communities, and it is noted for its worship of Maximón, an idol formed by the fusion of traditional Mayan deities, Catholic saints, and conquistador legends. The institutionalized effigy of Maximón is under the control of a local religious brotherhood and resides in various houses of its membership during the course of a year, being most ceremonially moved in a grand procession during Semana Santa. Several towns in Guatemala have similar cults, most notably the cult of San Simón in Zunil.
While Maya culture is predominant in most lakeside communities, Panajachel has been overwhelmed over the years by Guatemalan and foreign tourists. It attracted many hippies in the 1960s, and although the civil war caused many foreigners to leave, the end of hostilities in 1996 saw visitor numbers boom again, and the town&#x27;s economy is almost entirely reliant on tourism today.

Several Mayan archeological sites have been found at the lake. Sambaj, located approximately 55 feet below the current lake level, appears to be from at least the pre-classic period. There are remains of multiple groups of buildings, including one particular group of large buildings that are believed to have been the city center.

A project titled &quot;Underwater archeology in the Lake Atitlán. Sambaj 2003 Guatemala&quot; was recently approved by the Government of Guatemala in cooperation with Fundación Albenga and the Lake Museum in Atitlán. Because of the concerns of a private organization as is the Lake Museum in Atitlán the need to start the exploration of the inland waters in Guatemala was analyzed.

There is no road that circles the lake. Communities are reached by boat or roads from the mountains that may have brief extensions along the shore. Jaibalito can only be reached by boat. Santa Catarina Palopó and San Antonio Palopó are linked by road to Panajachel. Main places otherwise are Santa Clara La Laguna, San Juan La Laguna, and San Pedro La Laguna in the west; Santiago Atitlán in the south; Cerro de Oro in the southeast; and San Lucas Tolimán in the east.

Recent studies indicate that a ceremonial site named Samabaj was located on an island about long in Lake Atitlán. The site was revered for its striking connection to the Popol Wuj of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; Mayan peoples. 
==Guatemalan civil war==
During the Guatemalan Civil War (1960 - 1996), the lake was the scene of many terrible human rights abuses, as the government pursued a scorched earth policy. Indigenous people were assumed to be universally supportive of the guerrillas who were fighting against the government, and were targeted for brutal reprisals. Some believe that hundreds of Maya from Santiago Atitlán have disappeared during the conflict.

Two events of this era made international news. One was the assassination of Stanley Rother, a missionary from Oklahoma, in the church at Santiago Atitlán in 1981. In 1990, a spontaneous protest march to the army base on the edge of town was met by gunfire, resulting in the death of 11 unarmed civilians. International pressure forced the Guatemalan government to close the base and declare Santiago Atitlán a &quot;military-free zone&quot;. The memorial commemorating the massacre was damaged in the 2005 mudslide.

==Hurricane==
Torrential rains from Hurricane Stan caused extensive damage throughout Guatemala in early October 2005, particularly around Lake Atitlán. A massive landslide buried the lakeside village of Panabaj, causing the death of as many as 1,400 residents, leaving 5,000 homeless, and many bodies buried under tonnes of earth. Following this event, Diego Esquina Mendoza, the mayor of Santiago Atitlán, declared the community a mass gravesite: &quot;Those buried by the mudslide may never be rescued. Here they will stay buried, under five meters of mud. Panabáj is now a cemetery.&quot;

Four and a half years after Hurricane Stan, Tropical Storm Agatha dropped even more rainfall causing extensive damages to the region resulting in dozens of deaths between San Lucas Tolimán and San Antonio Palopó.
Since then roads have been reopened and travel to the region has returned to normal.

<text>The Polyfuze Method is the second studio album by American musician Kid Rock. Released in 1993 by Continuum and Top Dog Records, the album marked the beginning of Kid Rock&#x27;s shift from hip hop music to rap rock. &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; saw Kid Rock further develop his &quot;trailer-park pimp-daddy persona&quot;.

Producer Mike E. Clark worked with Kid Rock to give the album a more rock-oriented sound with live instruments, including heavy metal guitar and flute. The album was noted for its extensive sampling-based sound showcasing &quot;a love and mastery of &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;-esque sample-collage based production&quot;.

==Recording==

In 1990, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records and released his debut album, &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s success, Kid Rock was dropped by Jive. In 1992, Kid Rock signed with Detroit independent record label Continuum; the following year, he recorded his second studio album, &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; with producer Mike E. Clark.

==Artistry==
&quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; shows Kid Rock developing a rap rock sound. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Chaz Kangas described Kid Rock on this album as having &quot;a love and mastery of &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;-esque sample-collage based production&quot;. Producer Mike E. Clark worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut, utilizing live heavy metal guitars and sampling rock artists like Pink Floyd, as well as hiring a flute player to perform on the album. The album served as a crossroads between his hip hop and rock career, still maintaining a strong hip hop sound carried over from &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot;, while beginning Kid Rock&#x27;s use of rock and roll and country influences via sampling. A 2017 profile by &quot;Billboard&quot; categorized the album as being defined by &quot;trippy AOR samples&quot;.

According to Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus, &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; &quot;represents a significant leap forward not only in the development of Kid Rock&#x27;s unlikely mixture of classic rock, hip-hop, and country influences, but his own trailer-park pimp-daddy persona.&quot; Loftus feels the music on &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; was influenced by Public Enemy and N.W.A. He describes &quot;Killin&#x27; Brain Cells&quot; as being categorized by &quot;big percussion and a funky guitar sample&quot;, and that the song&#x27;s lyrics were defined by &quot;the confluence of blind bravado, hard liquor&quot;—these characteristics, along with the mixture of rock and hip hop, foreshadowed Kid Rock&#x27;s 1998 multiplatinum major label album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;, according to Loftus.

Chaz Kangas, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, said that &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; &quot;his approach’s metamorphosis into painting with broad strokes of other genres in his work&quot;. &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, an autobiographical song, lyrically describes Kid Rock leaving his family home to pursue a music career. Kangas wrote that &quot;In retrospect, the song today almost sounds like his outlaw manifesto.&quot; The song &quot;Fuck You Blind&quot; contained live guitars, which was not typical of the era&#x27;s hip hop. Atypical of the album&#x27;s sound was the more commercial-sounding &quot;U Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, which Kid Rock recorded as a joke to prove that &quot;anyone can [write a pop song]&quot;.

==Release and reception==

Kid Rock titled the album &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; after a line in a HairClub commercial. He intended to film a music video for the song &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, but Continuum Records dissuaded him against doing so, in favor of a video for the more commercial-sounding &quot;U Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, which the label had put out as a single and on the album without Kid Rock&#x27;s knowledge or approval. The video cost $30,000 to produce. With the production of the &quot;Back from the Dead&quot; music video, Kid Rock was given more creative control, being allowed to produce and direct the video. At $1,500, the video also cost less than the &quot;U Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; video. After signing with Atlantic Records, Kid Rock licensed &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot; to the label. The album was not offered for sale when Kid Rock&#x27;s catalog became available on iTunes.

The album received mixed reviews upon release. In a retrospective review, Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus gave the album three out of five stars, writing, &quot;Despite its strong suggestion of what was to come, &quot;Polyfuze Method&quot; doesn&#x27;t really go anywhere.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, however, praised the album&#x27;s sample-based sound and called the song &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; a &quot;classic&quot;.

==Track listings==

<doc id="978946" wikidata="Q1946691" url="?curid=978946" title="Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp">
<text>Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp is the third studio album by American rapper Kid Rock and the first to feature his backing band Twisted Brown Trucker. Released on January 9, 1996, by Top Dog Records, the album saw Kid Rock showcasing a more eclectic sound than his previous albums, encompassing funk, hip hop, soul and rock. It was considered the most rock-oriented album he had made at the time and the first to explore his Southern rock influences.

The album is considered to be a further shift in Kid Rock&#x27;s sound toward rock music, as well as furthering his rap metal sound and shaping the redneck image he would become known for. It &quot;captured the laid back pimp desperado persona that Rock had finally perfected&quot;.

==Background==

The recording sessions saw Kid Rock work with R&amp;B singer Thornetta Davis, who says that she asked him not to credit her on the album due to its risque lyrics on the song &quot;Paid&quot;, but this request was ignored. The album&#x27;s title came from engineer Bob Ebeling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, &quot;Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp.&quot; The recording sessions marked the first time Kid Rock would work with Jimmie &quot;Bones&quot; Trombly, who soon joined his backup band, Twisted Brown Trucker.

&quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; was originally recorded for the album, but remained unreleased until Kid Rock&#x27;s self-titled 2003 album.

==Artistry==
&quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; features what MTV describes as &quot;[an] eclectic collection of funk, rap, soul and rock.&quot; It was his most rock-oriented album at the time, and is seen as furthering the rap metal style of &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot;, and also for shaping Kid Rock&#x27;s redneck image and being the first album of his to explore his Southern rock influences, after &quot;two albums of pure Beastie Boys worship&quot;.

The title track &quot;captured the laid back pimp desperado persona that Rock had finally perfected&quot;, according to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Chaz Kangas. The song&#x27;s lyrics also diss Billy Ray Cyrus. &quot;Where U At Rock?&quot; references philosopher Ayn Rand.

In Chuck Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Always Forgets: A Quarter Century of Music Criticism&quot;, the music on &quot;Early Morning Stoned Pimp&quot; is categorized by musical elements such as &quot;descending symphonic blaxploitation wah-wah&quot;, &quot;hardboiled barbeque rib joint boogie drama, soul sister backup&quot;, &quot;synth sirens&quot;, &quot;Frampton vocoders&quot;, &quot;shotgun blasts, [and] spy movie organ&quot;. Eddy believes the album exhibits influence from Blowfly, Rudy Ray Moore, Swamp Dogg, Parliament and the dozens.

The lyrics of &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; deal with Kid Rock&#x27;s ten-year off-and-on relationship with a classmate named Kelley South Russell. Rock fathered a son with Russell; he also raised her son from a previous relationship. He broke up with her after finding out that a third child he was raising was not his. After this, he gained custody of his son, Robert James Ritchie Jr. These events became the inspiration for this song, which discusses them directly. However, Russell denies some of the allegations made against her in the lyrics.

==Release==

According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, &quot;Early Morning Stoned Pimp&quot; sold 14,000 copies. The album was not offered for sale when Kid Rock&#x27;s catalog became available on iTunes.

AllMusic, which did not review the album, gave it two and a half out of five stars. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Chaz Kangas called the title track a &quot;classic&quot;, writing, &quot;The reason the track works so well is because Rock’s own love and incorporation of his musical references isn’t rooted in a nostalgia or a &#x27;tribute,&#x27; but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention.&quot;

<text>Mary Joe Fernández Godsick (born María José Fernández; August 19, 1971) is an American former professional tennis player, who reached a career-high ranking of world No. 4 in both singles and doubles. In singles, Fernández was the runner-up at the 1990 and 1992 Australian Open, and the 1993 French Open. She also won a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. In doubles, she won the 1991 Australian Open with Patty Fendick and the 1996 French Open with Lindsay Davenport, plus two Olympic gold medals.

==Career==
Fernández first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as an outstanding junior player who won four straight Orange Bowl junior titles. In 1985, aged 14 years and eight days, she became the youngest player to win a main draw match at the US Open when she defeated Sara Gomer in the first round.

Turning professional in 1986, she won her first tour doubles title in 1989 at Dallas, partnering Betsy Nagelsen. She was also semifinalist at the 1989 French Open, losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario 2–6, 2–6.

She reached her first Grand Slam singles final in 1990 at the Australian Open, where she was defeated by Steffi Graf 3–6, 4–6 (having held a 4–1 lead herself in the second set). She won her first WTA Tour singles title the same year at the Tokyo Indoor championships, and finished the year ranked a career-high world No. 4 in singles.

In 1991, Fernández reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, where she was match point up against Monica Seles, before eventually losing 3–6, 6–0, 7–9. She teamed with Patty Fendick to win the women&#x27;s Australian Open doubles title. At Wimbledon, she reached the semifinals, losing to Steffi Graf in straight sets.

She reached the Australian Open singles final again in 1992, beating world No. 3, Gabriela Sabatini, in the semifinals before losing to Seles, 2–6, 3–6. She also reached the semifinals of the US Open, beating Sabatini in the quarterfinals and losing once again to Seles. At the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Fernández was selected to represent the United States and won both a gold medal in women&#x27;s doubles (with Gigi Fernández) and a bronze medal in singles.

In 1993, she won the title in Indian Wells, defeating Amanda Coetzer in the final. At the French Open, she defeated world No. 5 Sabatini in the quarterfinals and world No. 3 Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. In the final against Steffi Graf, Fernandez held several points to lead 3–0 in the final set, but eventually lost 6–4, 2–6, 4–6.

Fernández won her second Grand Slam doubles title in 1996 at the French Open, partnering with Lindsay Davenport. The pair went on to capture the year-end WTA Tour Championships doubles title later that year.

She was a late replacement for Chanda Rubin on the United States team for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. She won a second straight women&#x27;s doubles gold medal, again in partnership with Gigi Fernández. She was also entered in the singles competition (owing to a withdrawal), and reached the semifinals, defeating world No. 2, Conchita Martínez, in the quarterfinals. She was defeated for the bronze medal by Jana Novotná. Later that year, Fernández was a member of the U.S. team that won the Fed Cup.

Fernández reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in 1997, losing to Martina Hingis 1–6, 3–6. In May, she won her first and only Tier I tournament in Berlin, beating Jana Novotná in the semifinals and Mary Pierce in the final. At the end-of-year WTA Finals, she defeated world No. 2, Lindsay Davenport.

In 1999, she defeated Serena Williams in the third round of the French Open and in her last Grand Slam appearance she lost to Venus Williams in the fourth round of the US Open the same year.

She retired from the tour in 2000, having won a total of 24 titles: seven WTA singles titles and 17 doubles titles.

==Post retirement==
Fernández coached the US Fed Cup team from 2008 to 2016 and served as the woman&#x27;s coach for the 2012 U.S. Olympic tennis team in London.

She currently works as an analyst and commentator for ESPN.

==Personal life==
Fernández was born in the Dominican Republic; her parents were immigrants to the country. Her father José is from Asturias, Spain, and her mother Silvia Pino is from Cuba. She completed her high school education at the Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart in Miami, Florida.

In April 2000, Fernández married Anthony (Tony) Godsick, a sports agent with International Management Group. Monica Seles was a bridesmaid at the wedding. They have two children. Her husband is the current agent of Roger Federer. One of their children, Nicholas Godsick, is also a tennis player.

She has homes in Cleveland, Ohio, and Key Biscayne, Florida.

<doc id="978951" wikidata="Q1266546" url="?curid=978951" title="Record linkage">
<text>Record linkage (also known as data matching, data linkage, entity resolution, and many other terms) is the task of finding records in a data set that refer to the same across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, and databases). Record linkage is necessary when joining different data sets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), which may be due to differences in record shape, storage location, or curator style or preference. A data set that has undergone RL-oriented reconciliation may be referred to as being &quot;cross-linked&quot;. 

== Naming conventions ==
&quot;Record linkage&quot; is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others, to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity. However, many other terms are used for this process. Unfortunately, this profusion of terminology has led to few cross-references between these research communities.

Computer scientists often refer to it as &quot;data matching&quot; or as the &quot;object identity problem&quot;. Commercial mail and database applications refer to it as &quot;merge/purge processing&quot; or &quot;list washing&quot;. Other names used to describe the same concept include: &quot;coreference/entity/identity/name/record resolution&quot;, &quot;entity disambiguation/linking&quot;, &quot;fuzzy matching&quot;, &quot;duplicate detection&quot;, &quot;deduplication&quot;, &quot;record matching&quot;, &quot;(reference) reconciliation&quot;, &quot;object identification&quot;, &quot;data/information integration&quot; and &quot;conflation&quot;.

While they share similar names, record linkage and linked data are two separate approaches to processing and structuring data. Although both involve identifying matching entities across different data sets, record linkage standardly equates &quot;entities&quot; with human individuals; by contrast, Linked Data is based on the possibility of interlinking any web resource across data sets, using a correspondingly broader concept of identifier, namely a URI.

== History ==
The initial idea of record linkage goes back to Halbert L. Dunn in his 1946 article titled &quot;Record Linkage&quot; published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;.

Howard Borden Newcombe then laid the probabilistic foundations of modern record linkage theory in a 1959 article in &quot;Science&quot;. These were formalized in 1969 by Ivan Fellegi and Alan Sunter, in their pioneering work &quot;A Theory For Record Linkage&quot;, where they proved that the probabilistic decision rule they described was optimal when the comparison attributes were conditionally independent. In their work they recognized the growing interest in applying advances in computing and automation to large collections of administrative data, and the &quot;Fellegi-Sunter theory&quot; remains the mathematical foundation for many record linkage applications.

Since the late 1990s, various machine learning techniques have been developed that can, under favorable conditions, be used to estimate the conditional probabilities required by the Fellegi-Sunter theory. Several researchers have reported that the conditional independence assumption of the Fellegi-Sunter algorithm is often violated in practice; however, published efforts to explicitly model the conditional dependencies among the comparison attributes have not resulted in an improvement in record linkage quality. On the other hand, machine learning or neural network algorithms that do not rely on these assumptions often provide far higher accuracy, when sufficient labeled training data is available.

Record linkage can be done entirely without the aid of a computer, but the primary reasons computers are often used to complete record linkages are to reduce or eliminate manual review and to make results more easily reproducible. Computer matching has the advantages of allowing central supervision of processing, better quality control, speed, consistency, and better reproducibility of results.

== Methods ==

=== Data preprocessing ===
Record linkage is highly sensitive to the quality of the data being linked, so all data sets under consideration (particularly their key identifier fields) should ideally undergo a data quality assessment prior to record linkage. Many key identifiers for the same entity can be presented quite differently between (and even within) data sets, which can greatly complicate record linkage unless understood ahead of time. For example, key identifiers for a man named William J. Smith might appear in three different data sets as so:

In this example, the different formatting styles lead to records that look different but in fact all refer to the same entity with the same logical identifier values. Most, if not all, record linkage strategies would result in more accurate linkage if these values were first &quot;normalized&quot; or &quot;standardized&quot; into a consistent format (e.g., all names are &quot;Surname, Given name&quot;, and all dates are &quot;YYYY/MM/DD&quot;). Standardization can be accomplished through simple rule-based data transformations or more complex procedures such as lexicon-based tokenization and probabilistic hidden Markov models. Several of the packages listed in the &quot;Software Implementations&quot; section provide some of these features to simplify the process of data standardization.

===Entity resolution===
Entity resolution is an operational intelligence process, typically powered by an entity resolution engine or middleware, whereby organizations can connect disparate data sources with a view to understanding possible entity matches and non-obvious relationships across multiple data silos. It analyzes all of the information relating to individuals and/or entities from multiple sources of data, and then applies likelihood and probability scoring to determine which identities are a match and what, if any, non-obvious relationships exist between those identities.

Entity resolution engines are typically used to uncover risk, fraud, and conflicts of interest, but are also useful tools for use within customer data integration (CDI) and master data management (MDM) requirements. Typical uses for entity resolution engines include terrorist screening, insurance fraud detection, USA Patriot Act compliance, organized retail crime ring detection and applicant screening.

For example: Across different data silos – employee records, vendor data, watch lists, etc. – an organization may have several variations of an entity named ABC, which may or may not be the same individual. These entries may, in fact, appear as ABC1, ABC2, or ABC3 within those data sources. By comparing similarities between underlying attributes such as address, date of birth, or social security number, the user can eliminate some possible matches and confirm others as very likely matches.

Entity resolution engines then apply rules, based on common sense logic, to identify hidden relationships across the data. In the example above, perhaps ABC1 and ABC2 are not the same individual, but rather two distinct people who share common attributes such as address or phone number.

====Data matching====
While entity resolution solutions include data matching technology, many data matching offerings do not fit the definition of entity resolution. Here are four factors that distinguish entity resolution from data matching, according to John Talburt, director of the UALR Center for Advanced Research in Entity Resolution and Information Quality:

* Works with both structured and unstructured records, and it entails the process of extracting references when the sources are unstructured or semi-structured
* Uses elaborate business rules and concept models to deal with missing, conflicting, and corrupted information
* Utilizes non-matching, asserted linking (associate) information in addition to direct matching
* Uncovers non-obvious relationships and association networks (i.e. who&#x27;s associated with whom)

In contrast to data quality products, more powerful identity resolution engines also include a rules engine and workflow process, which apply business intelligence to the resolved identities and their relationships. These advanced technologies make automated decisions and impact business processes in real time, limiting the need for human intervention.

=== Deterministic record linkage ===
The simplest kind of record linkage, called &quot;deterministic&quot; or &quot;rules-based record linkage&quot;, generates links based on the number of individual identifiers that match among the available data sets. Two records are said to match via a deterministic record linkage procedure if all or some identifiers (above a certain threshold) are identical. Deterministic record linkage is a good option when the entities in the data sets are identified by a common identifier, or when there are several representative identifiers (e.g., name, date of birth, and sex when identifying a person) whose quality of data is relatively high.

As an example, consider two standardized data sets, Set A and Set B, that contain different bits of information about patients in a hospital system. The two data sets identify patients using a variety of identifiers: Social Security Number (SSN), name, date of birth (DOB), sex, and ZIP code (ZIP). The records in two data sets (identified by the &quot;#&quot; column) are shown below:

The most simple deterministic record linkage strategy would be to pick a single identifier that is assumed to be uniquely identifying, say SSN, and declare that records sharing the same value identify the same person while records not sharing the same value identify different people. In this example, deterministic linkage based on SSN would create entities based on A1 and A2; A3 and B1; and A4. While A1, A2, and B2 appear to represent the same entity, B2 would not be included into the match because it is missing a value for SSN.

Handling exceptions such as missing identifiers involves the creation of additional record linkage rules. One such rule in the case of missing SSN might be to compare name, date of birth, sex, and ZIP code with other records in hopes of finding a match. In the above example, this rule would still not match A1/A2 with B2 because the names are still slightly different: standardization put the names into the proper (Surname, Given name) format but could not discern &quot;Bill&quot; as a nickname for &quot;William&quot;. Running names through a phonetic algorithm such as Soundex, NYSIIS, or metaphone, can help to resolve these types of problems. However, they may still stumble over surname changes as the result of marriage or divorce, but then B2 would be matched only with A1 since the ZIP code in A2 is different. Thus, another rule would need to be created to determine whether differences in particular identifiers are acceptable (such as ZIP code) and which are not (such as date of birth).

As this example demonstrates, even a small decrease in data quality or small increase in the complexity of the data can result in a very large increase in the number of rules necessary to link records properly. Eventually, these linkage rules will become too numerous and interrelated to build without the aid of specialized software tools. In addition, linkage rules are often specific to the nature of the data sets they are designed to link together. One study was able to link the Social Security Death Master File with two hospital registries from the Midwestern United States using SSN, NYSIIS-encoded first name, birth month, and sex, but these rules may not work as well with data sets from other geographic regions or with data collected on younger populations. Thus, continuous maintenance testing of these rules is necessary to ensure they continue to function as expected as new data enter the system and need to be linked. New data that exhibit different characteristics than was initially expected could require a complete rebuilding of the record linkage rule set, which could be a very time-consuming and expensive endeavor.

=== Probabilistic record linkage ===
&quot;Probabilistic record linkage&quot;, sometimes called &quot;fuzzy matching&quot; (also &quot;probabilistic merging&quot; or &quot;fuzzy merging&quot; in the context of merging of databases), takes a different approach to the record linkage problem by taking into account a wider range of potential identifiers, computing weights for each identifier based on its estimated ability to correctly identify a match or a non-match, and using these weights to calculate the probability that two given records refer to the same entity. Record pairs with probabilities above a certain threshold are considered to be matches, while pairs with probabilities below another threshold are considered to be non-matches; pairs that fall between these two thresholds are considered to be &quot;possible matches&quot; and can be dealt with accordingly (e.g., human reviewed, linked, or not linked, depending on the requirements). Whereas deterministic record linkage requires a series of potentially complex rules to be programmed ahead of time, probabilistic record linkage methods can be &quot;trained&quot; to perform well with much less human intervention.

Many probabilistic record linkage algorithms assign match/non-match weights to identifiers by means of two probabilities called formula_1 and formula_2. The formula_1 probability is the probability that an identifier in two &quot;non-matching&quot; records will agree purely by chance. For example, the formula_1 probability for birth month (where there are twelve values that are approximately uniformly distributed) is formula_5; identifiers with values that are not uniformly distributed will have different formula_1 probabilities for different values (possibly including missing values). The formula_2 probability is the probability that an identifier in &quot;matching&quot; pairs will agree (or be sufficiently similar, such as strings with low Jaro-Winkler or Levenshtein distance). This value would be formula_8 in the case of perfect data, but given that this is rarely (if ever) true, it can instead be estimated. This estimation may be done based on prior knowledge of the data sets, by manually identifying a large number of matching and non-matching pairs to &quot;train&quot; the probabilistic record linkage algorithm, or by iteratively running the algorithm to obtain closer estimations of the formula_2 probability. If a value of formula_10 were to be estimated for the formula_2 probability, then the match/non-match weights for the birth month identifier would be:

The same calculations would be done for all other identifiers under consideration to find their match/non-match weights. Then, every identifier of one record would be compared with the corresponding identifier of another record to compute the total weight of the pair: the &quot;match&quot; weight is added to the running total whenever a pair of identifiers agree, while the &quot;non-match&quot; weight is added (i.e. the running total decreases) whenever the pair of identifiers disagrees. The resulting total weight is then compared to the aforementioned thresholds to determine whether the pair should be linked, non-linked, or set aside for special consideration (e.g. manual validation).

==== Blocking ====

Determining where to set the match/non-match thresholds is a balancing act between obtaining an acceptable sensitivity (or &quot;recall&quot;, the proportion of truly matching records that are linked by the algorithm) and positive predictive value (or &quot;precision&quot;, the proportion of records linked by the algorithm that truly do match). Various manual and automated methods are available to predict the best thresholds, and some record linkage software packages have built-in tools to help the user find the most acceptable values. Because this can be a very computationally demanding task, particularly for large data sets, a technique known as &quot;blocking&quot; is often used to improve efficiency. Blocking attempts to restrict comparisons to just those records for which one or more particularly discriminating identifiers agree, which has the effect of increasing the positive predictive value (precision) at the expense of sensitivity (recall). For example, blocking based on a phonetically coded surname and ZIP code would reduce the total number of comparisons required and would improve the chances that linked records would be correct (since two identifiers already agree), but would potentially miss records referring to the same person whose surname or ZIP code was different (due to marriage or relocation, for instance). Blocking based on birth month, a more stable identifier that would be expected to change only in the case of data error, would provide a more modest gain in positive predictive value and loss in sensitivity, but would create only twelve distinct groups which, for extremely large data sets, may not provide much net improvement in computation speed. Thus, robust record linkage systems often use multiple blocking passes to group data in various ways in order to come up with groups of records that should be compared to each other.

===Machine learning===
In recent years, a variety of machine learning techniques have been used in record linkage. It has been recognized that the classic Fellegi-Sunter algorithm for probabilistic record linkage outlined above is equivalent to the Naive Bayes algorithm in the field of machine learning, and suffers from the same assumption of the independence of its features (an assumption that is typically not true). Higher accuracy can often be achieved by using various other machine learning techniques, including a single-layer perceptron, random forest, and SVM. In conjunction with distributed technologies, accuracy and scale for record linkage can be improved further.

===Human-machine hybrid record linkage===
High quality record linkage often requires a human–machine hybrid system to safely manage uncertainty in the ever changing streams of chaotic big data. Recognizing that linkage errors propagate into the linked data and its analysis, interactive record linkage systems have been proposed. Interactive record linkage is defined as people iteratively fine tuning the results from the automated methods and managing the uncertainty and its propagation to subsequent analyses. The main objectives of interactive record linkage systems is to manually resolve uncertain linkages and validate the results until it is at acceptable levels for the given application. Variations of interactive record linkage that enhance privacy during the human interaction steps have also been proposed.

=== Privacy-preserving record linkage ===
Record linkage is increasingly required across databases held by different organisations, where the complementary data held by these organisations can, for example, help to identify patients that are susceptible to certain adverse drug reactions (linking hospital, doctor, pharmacy databases). In many such applications, however, the databases to be linked contain sensitive information about people which cannot be shared between the organisations.

Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) methods have been developed with the aim to link databases without the need of sharing the original sensitive values between the organisations that participate in a linkage. In PPRL, generally the attribute values of records to be compared are encoded or encrypted in some form. A popular such encoding technique used are Bloom filter, which allows approximate similarities to be calculated between encoded values without the need for sharing the corresponding sensitive plain-text values. At the end of the PPRL process only limited information about the record pairs classified as matches is revealed to the organisations that participate in the linkage process. The techniques used in PPRL must guarantee that no participating organisation, nor any external adversary, can compromise the privacy of the entities that are represented by records in the databases being linked.

== Mathematical model ==
In an application with two files, A and B, denote the rows (&quot;records&quot;) by formula_12 in file A and formula_13 in file B. Assign formula_14 &quot;characteristics&quot; to each record. The set of records that represent identical entities is defined by

formula_15

and the complement of set formula_16, namely set formula_17 representing different entities is defined as

formula_18.

A vector, formula_19 is defined, that contains the coded agreements and disagreements on each characteristic:

formula_20

where formula_14 is a subscript for the characteristics (sex, age, marital status, etc.) in the files. The conditional probabilities of observing a specific vector formula_19 given formula_23, formula_24 are defined as

formula_25

and

formula_26
respectively.

== Applications ==

===Master data management===
Most Master data management (MDM) products use a record linkage process to identify records from different sources representing the same real-world entity. This linkage is used to create a &quot;golden master record&quot; containing the cleaned, reconciled data about the entity. The techniques used in MDM are the same as for record linkage generally. MDM expands this matching not only to create a &quot;golden master record&quot; but to infer relationships also. (i.e. a person has a same/similar surname and same/similar address, this might imply they share a household relationship).

=== Data warehousing and business intelligence ===
Record linkage plays a key role in data warehousing and business intelligence. Data warehouses serve to combine data from many different operational source systems into one logical data model, which can then be subsequently fed into a business intelligence system for reporting and analytics. Each operational source system may have its own method of identifying the same entities used in the logical data model, so record linkage between the different sources becomes necessary to ensure that the information about a particular entity in one source system can be seamlessly compared with information about the same entity from another source system. Data standardization and subsequent record linkage often occur in the &quot;transform&quot; portion of the extract, transform, load (ETL) process.

=== Historical research ===
Record linkage is important to social history research since most data sets, such as census records and parish registers were recorded long before the invention of National identification numbers. When old sources are digitized, linking of data sets is a prerequisite for longitudinal study. This process is often further complicated by lack of standard spelling of names, family names that change according to place of dwelling, changing of administrative boundaries, and problems of checking the data against other sources. Record linkage was among the most prominent themes in the History and computing field in the 1980s, but has since been subject to less attention in research.

=== Medical practice and research ===

Record linkage is an important tool in creating data required for examining the health of the public and of the health care system itself. It can be used to improve data holdings, data collection, quality assessment, and the dissemination of information. Data sources can be examined to eliminate duplicate records, to identify under-reporting and missing cases (e.g., census population counts), to create person-oriented health statistics, and to generate disease registries and health surveillance systems. Some cancer registries link various data sources (e.g., hospital admissions, pathology and clinical reports, and death registrations) to generate their registries. Record linkage is also used to create health indicators. For example, fetal and infant mortality is a general indicator of a country&#x27;s socioeconomic development, public health, and maternal and child services. If infant death records are matched to birth records, it is possible to use birth variables, such as birth weight and gestational age, along with mortality data, such as cause of death, in analyzing the data. Linkages can help in follow-up studies of cohorts or other groups to determine factors such as vital status, residential status, or health outcomes. Tracing is often needed for follow-up of industrial cohorts, clinical trials, and longitudinal surveys to obtain the cause of death and/or cancer. An example of a successful and long-standing record linkage system allowing for population-based medical research is the Rochester Epidemiology Project based in Rochester, Minnesota.

== Criticism of existing software implementations==
The main reasons cited are:
* Project costs: costs typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
* Time: lack of enough time to deal with large-scale data cleansing software
* Security: concerns over sharing information, giving an application access across systems, and effects on legacy systems
* Scalability: Due to the absence of unique identifiers in records, record linkage is computationally expensive and difficult to scale.
* Accuracy: Changing business data and capturing of all rules for linking is a tough and extensive exercise

<text>João Fernandes Lavrador (1453–1501) () was a Portuguese explorer of the late 15th century. He was one of the first modern explorers of the Northeast coasts of North America, including the large Labrador peninsula, which was named after him by European settlers in eastern Canada. The popular dog breed Labrador Retriever is named after the peninsula and thus by effect also bears his name.

== Expeditions ==
Lavrador was granted a patent by King Manuel I in 1498 that gave him the right to explore the part of the Atlantic Ocean as set out in the Treaty of Tordesillas.

Together with Pero de Barcelos, Lavrador first sighted what is now known as Labrador in 1498. Lavrador also charted the coasts of Southwestern Greenland and of adjacent Northeastern North America around 1498; he reported on these observations and gave notice of them in Europe. The areas are believed to have been named &quot;island of the Labrador&quot; and &quot;land of the Labrador&quot; (modern-day Labrador), respectively, after him.

Upon his return from Greenland, Lavrador sailed to Bristol. He received a patent for exploration from King Henry VII. In 1501 Lavrador set sail for discovery of lands in the name of England. He was never heard from again.

Lavrador was granted title to much of the lands he had discovered and is considered the first European landowner in Labrador.

<text>Air Marshal Sir Charles Roderick Carr, (31 August 1891 – 15 December 1971) was a senior Royal Air Force commander from New Zealand. He held high command in the Second World War and served as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief in India.

==Education and military career==

Educated at a Feilding public school and Wellington College, New Zealand, Carr was commissioned as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service in July 1915. He saw action as a spotter at the Battle of Loos in October 1915 during the First World War.

In 1919, Carr went to Russia to fight on the anti-Bolshevist side in the civil war, where he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for action against the enemy. The citation was as follows:

Between 28 November 1919 and 18 February 1920, Carr served as chief of the Lithuanian Air Force (Aviacijos dalis).

In 1921, Carr was a member of Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s final Antarctic expedition. On his return, he was granted an RAF short service commission in the rank of flying officer.

In 1927, Carr and Flight Lieutenant L.E.M. Gillman attempted a non-stop flight to India, in a specially modified Hawker Horsley aircraft carrying much extra fuel and taking off at a weight of over . Carr and Gillman took off from RAF Cranwell on 20 May 1927, but ran out of fuel &quot;en route&quot;, ditching in the Persian Gulf near Bandar Abbas, Iran. Despite this they had covered a distance of , which was sufficient to set a new world distance record, but which was beaten in turn within a few hours by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo Atlantic flight between New York and Paris in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, covering .

During the Second World War, Carr served in Bomber Command as Air Officer Commanding No. 4 Group RAF for the majority of the war. Carr was promoted and appointed Deputy Chief of Staff (Air) at the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force in June 1945, in the final stages of the North West Europe Campaign. Two months later, Carr became Air Marshal Commanding, HQ Base Air Forces South East Asia, and then BAFSEA was disbanded, and on 1 April 1946, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Headquarters India.

His war services were recognised with the award of Commander of the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre by the President of France. In the 1941 New Year Honours, Carr was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and he was promoted to Knight Commander of the same order in July 1945. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1943 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

In retirement, he lived in Bampton, Oxfordshire. He died at RAF Hospital Uxbridge.

<doc id="978957" wikidata="Q3116101" url="?curid=978957" title="Green Left (Australian newspaper)">
<text>Green Left, previously known as Green Left Weekly, is an Australian socialist newspaper, written by activists to, according to itself, &quot;present the views excluded by the big business media&quot;. The newspaper was founded in 1990. &quot;Green Left&quot; is the de facto newspaper of the Socialist Alliance.

==Overview==
The newspaper is a notionally independent Australian source of local, national and international news, and provides left-wing analysis and debate. In an editorial in the first issue, &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; stated:
In 2023, the paper stated:

Although the newspaper was initiated by the Democratic Socialist Perspective, the newspaper has been supported by a variety of groups throughout its history. In the early 1990s, Australian Democrats senators Sid Spindler and Janet Powell supported and sponsored the newspaper.

Subjects of particular importance to &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; include anti-capitalism, workers rights, refugees, women&#x27;s rights, global warming, environmental destruction, Australian Aboriginal land rights, and foreign policy, especially Australia&#x27;s military intervention in the Asia-Pacific region, the US led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and other forms of US political intervention overseas.

In 2011, Victorian Consumer Affairs Minister Michael O&#x27;Brien asked the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate whether a number of groups, including &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;, had breached secondary boycott laws by supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement pickets at the premises of the Max Brenner chain of chocolate shops. The ACCC determined that the protests were not a secondary boycott.

The newspaper strongly supports the socialist policy of Bolivia and Ecuador and the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela led by Hugo Chávez, and in the past opened a bureau in Caracas to improve its coverage of events there. At the time, it claimed to be the only Australian newspaper with a bureau in Latin America.

It is also the only Australian newspaper to regularly print articles by left-wing journalist John Pilger. Pilger has said of &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;: &quot;There are few other newspapers — radical or any other kind — that draw together news and analysis that is as well informed, credible, and non-sectarian as &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;. Its work has influenced mine and has been a beacon to those who believe the press ought to be an agent of the people.&quot;

Since 2008, &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; has published a monthly Arabic language supplement, &quot;The Flame&quot;, edited by Socialist Alliance members of the growing Sudanese Australian community. In 2009, &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; launched a new Spanish language supplement, &quot;Foro Social Latinamericano&quot;, edited by the Latin America Social Forum in Sydney, a collaboration between left-wing members and groups in the Latin American community in Australia.

In 2009, &quot;The Australian&quot; accused &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; of supporting terrorism for its criticism of Israel.

In 2024 the &quot;Green Left&quot; facebook page was banned twice by social media corporation Meta. The second ban is to be for ten years and reasoning is due to the page publishing content of Leila Khalid, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front.

==Awards==
In June 2005 &quot;Green Left weekly&quot; won an award from web-surveying company Hitwise. Hitwise ranked the website as the most popular Australian-based political site. &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; received a similar award in 2006, and in the period between June and December 2009, &quot;Green Left weekly&quot; once again ranked in the top ten, achieving 7th position.

<doc id="978967" wikidata="Q904623" url="?curid=978967" title="Devil Without a Cause">
<text>Devil Without a Cause is the fourth studio album by American musician Kid Rock. Released on August 18, 1998, the album saw Kid Rock continuing to develop his sound, and marked the finalization of his stage persona as a &#x27;redneck pimp&#x27;. Additionally, the song &quot;Cowboy&quot; is seen as being instrumental in the development of the fusion genre country rap.

&quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; was a major commercial success. Spurred by the popularity of the single &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, the album sold over 14 million copies, and was certified diamond. The album also received critical acclaim for its genre-mixing sound.

==Recording==
In 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock&#x27;s performances, and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Feel This&quot; and &quot;I Got One for Ya&quot;, which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records. As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label. By this time, Kid Rock had fully developed his pimp redneck stage persona and rap rock musical style and wanted to make a &quot;redneck, shit-kicking rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rap&quot; album.

The album was recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles. Kid Rock spent two months in the studio with &quot;a hot tub, some girls and some illegal substances&quot;. In addition to the newly written songs, the band also re-recorded some of Kid Rock&#x27;s older songs, including &quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot; from the album &quot;The Polyfuze Method&quot;, and &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; from the album &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot;.

During the recording sessions, Eminem was mixing &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; at the same studio, and, being friends with Kid Rock, asked him to record scratching for the song &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck.&quot; In return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid&#x27;s song &quot;Fuck Off.&quot; In a 1999 interview with Spin Magazine, Eminem told the interviewer that he used cocaine for the first and last time ever while writing and recording his verse with Kid. According to Eminem, Kid was in &quot;full party mode with tons of different drugs just laid out near the studio mixing board. There were &quot;Playboy&quot; playmates just passed out naked with coke on their nose. It was overwhelming. I never touched that shit again.&quot;

==Composition==
===Style===
&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that while &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; is &quot;not nü-metal, [it] extended the lineage of rap-rock that Run-DMC and Aerosmith had first established.&quot; Nevertheless, the album has been described as a notable nu metal release, that helped &quot;create the rap-rock/nu-metal phenomenon&quot;. AllMusic said that the album best demonstrated the &quot;organic, integrated sound&quot; of rap rock that differed sharply from that of rap metal, which in contrast sounded &quot;as if the riffs were merely overdubbed over scratching and beat box beats&quot;, whereas rap rock, as &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; demonstrated, was defined as &quot;rock song[s] where the vocalist rapped instead of sang&quot;. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;The key to [the album&#x27;s] success is that it&#x27;s never trying to be a hip-hop record. It&#x27;s simply a monster rock album.&quot; Erlewine credits Kid Rock&#x27;s backing band, Twisted Brown Trucker, for crafting a sound defined by &quot;thunderous, funky noise -- and that&#x27;s funky not just in the classic sense, but also in a Southern-fried, white trash sense, as he gives this as much foundation in country as he does hip-hop.&quot; Erlewine believes the album&#x27;s sound owed influence to Bob Seger, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Van Halen.&quot; Erlewine also believed the album was &quot;firmly in the tradition of classic hard rock&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;it’s not a stretch to call &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;, Rock’s breakthrough fourth record, the &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; or &quot;The Chronic&quot; of rap-rock.&quot;

===Music and lyrics===

&quot;Bawitdaba&quot; has been described as having a nu metal sound. To create the chorus, Kid Rock combined the choruses of Busy Bee&#x27;s &quot;Making Cash Money&quot;, the Marcels&#x27; recording of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; and the Sugar Hill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; into a &quot;neo-gregorian drone&quot;. The lyrics of the song are dedicated to &quot;chicks with beepers&quot; and the I.R.S., as well as &quot;all the crackheads, the critics, the cynics / And all my heroes in the methadone clinic.&quot; In the demo recording of the song, Kid Rock shouts, &quot;Now get in the pit and try to kill someone!&quot; On the album version, Kid Rock changed the lyrics, replacing the word &quot;kill&quot; with &quot;love&quot;. Regarding the change, Kid Rock told the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; that he was glad he changed the lyrics, explaining that mosh pits are about coexistence.

The country rap song &quot;Cowboy&quot; was newly written for the album. It is a fusion of hip hop, country music, Southern rock and heavy metal. &quot;Billboard&quot;, as well as Kid Rock himself, described the song as a cross between Run DMC and Lynyrd Skynyrd. The instrumentation includes Jew&#x27;s harp, blues harmonica and a piano solo. The lyrics feature Kid Rock rapping about moving to California to become a pimp, and start an escort service &quot;for all the right reasons&quot;, located at the top of the Four Seasons hotel, as well as getting thrown out of bars and buying a yacht.

&quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot;, according to AXS, was a tribute to the band Monster Magnet. azcentral described the song&#x27;s style as Southern rock, with elements of funk, while &quot;Billboard&quot; categorized the song as stoner rock. The lyrics refer to drinking Jim Beam bourbon whiskey; Kid Rock declares that &quot;I am free and I feed on all that is forsaken&quot; and that &quot;I never was cool with James Dean&quot;, a reference to the actor who starred in the film that inspired this album&#x27;s title, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;.

The song &quot;Wasting Time&quot; contains an interpolation of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Second Hand News&quot;. &quot;Welcome 2 the Party (Ode 2 the Old School)&quot; refers to Orson Welles&#x27; Paul Masson adverts with the lyric &quot;I will serve no rhymes before their time&quot;. &quot;Where U At Rock?&quot; references philosopher Ayn Rand.

&quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; is a country ballad, noted for its prominent use of Auto-Tune. The lyrics of &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; deal with Kid Rock&#x27;s ten-year off-and-on relationship with a classmate named Kelley South Russell, with whom he fathered one child and raised another child from a previous relationship, but broke up with her after finding out that a third child he was raising wasn&#x27;t his, after which he gained custody of his son, Robert James Ritchie Jr.; these events became the inspiration for this song, which discusses them directly, although Russell denies some of the allegations made against her in the lyrics.

==Reception==
===Critical reviews===

The album received critical acclaim upon release. Robert Christgau gave the album an A−, writing, &quot;Belatedly fulfilling the rap-metal promise of &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, [Kid Rock] makes the competition sound clownish, limp, and corny, respectively, and the Eminem cameo is a draw [...] [Kid Rock] is, and I quote, all of that and a bag of chips.&quot;

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, its byline hailing it as &quot;a trailer trash triumph of metal guitars, hip-hop beats, and I&#x27;m-an-American-band egomania.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, writing, &quot;[Kid Rock] came up with the great hard rock album of the late &#x27;90s -- a fearlessly funny, bone-crunching record that manages to sustain its strength, not just until the end of its long running time, but through repeated plays.&quot;

In a negative review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album 1.3 out of 10, writing, &quot;The hook is that &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot; combines rap with metal, but this combination&#x27;s already been done a million times, and in each case, the result was better than this. Do you really need predictable pimping rhymes over wack-ass metal beats with third-tier, grunge-derived choruses among your records? I ask you: is this what you&#x27;re missing from your life?&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Starting in 1998, Kid Rock disembarked on his Devil Without a Cause Tour. In the spring of 1999, Kid Rock joined Limp Bizkit and Staind on the Limptropolis tour. Through extensive promoting, including appearances on HBO, MTV (including a performance alongside Aerosmith and Run-DMC) and performing at Woodstock 1999, &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; sold over 14 million copies, the album&#x27;s success spurred by Kid Rock&#x27;s breakthrough hit single &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;.

By April 1999, the album was certified gold, and the following month it was certified platinum, a certification the album received 11 times. The album has since been certified diamond. The album had sold 8.9 million copies per Nielsen SoundScan as of 2007.

In 2000, Kid Rock was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years.

==Legacy==
The album continued to be popular long after its release, and in 2012, Kid Rock said that he wanted to re-record the album in its entirety, partly to celebrate the album&#x27;s 15th anniversary, and partly because he would own the master recordings.

The album&#x27;s critical appraisal has continued long after the album&#x27;s release, with Allmusic labeling &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; a &quot;rap-rock masterpiece&quot;. The song &quot;Cowboy&quot; is considered by AXS to be the first in the country rap genre; &quot;Cowboys &amp; Indians&quot; claims that Kid Rock&#x27;s song had a major impact on the country music scene and that artists Jason Aldean and Big &amp; Rich, among others, were influenced by the song.

Fifteen years after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Chaz Kangas praised Kid Rock&#x27;s artistry, writing, &quot;in the Clinton era when your most viable pop stars were pristine teen-pop sensations, raucous nu-metal antagonists or alternative-to-alternative-to-alternative rock weirdos, Rock stood alone.&quot; Praising the song &quot;Cowboy&quot;, Kangas called it &quot;one track from this era that&#x27;s timeless without even trying to be.&quot;

Loudwire named &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; one of the 10 best hard rock albums of 1998. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine named &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; one of 10 essential rap metal albums. &quot;Blender&quot; named &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; one of the 100 greatest American albums. The album was also listed as one of the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Track listing==
*The song &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; ends at 7:07 and the remix begins at 7:10; the remix is presented as a hidden track on the compact disc, but is credited on digital services. The remix is omitted from the Japanese version of the album. &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; does not appear on the clean version.

<doc id="978969" wikidata="Q1049628" url="?curid=978969" title="DOS/V">
<text>DOS/V is a Japanese computing initiative starting in 1990 to allow DOS on IBM PC compatibles with VGA cards to handle double-byte (DBCS) Japanese text via software alone. It was initially developed from PC DOS by IBM for its PS/55 machines (a localized version of the PS/2), but IBM gave the driver source code to Microsoft, who then licensed a DOS/V-compatible version of MS-DOS to other companies. 

Kanji fonts and other locale information are stored on the hard disk rather than on special chips as in the preceding AX architecture. As with AX, its great value for the Japanese computing industry is in allowing compatibility with foreign software. This had not been possible under NEC&#x27;s proprietary PC-98 system, which was the market leader before DOS/V emerged. DOS/V stands for &quot;Disk Operating System/VGA&quot; (not &quot;version 5&quot;; DOS/V came out at approximately the same time as DOS 5). In Japan, IBM compatible PCs became popular along with DOS/V, so they were often referred to as &quot;DOS/V machine&quot; or &quot;DOS/V pasocom&quot; even though DOS/V operating systems are no longer common by the late 1990s.

The promotion of DOS/V was done by IBM and its consortium called PC Open Architecture Developers&#x27; Group (OADG). Digital Research released a Japanese DOS/V-compatible version of DR DOS 6.0 in 1992.

==History==
In the early 1980s, IBM Japan developed two x86-based personal computer lines for the Asia-Pacific region, IBM 5550 and IBM JX. The 5550 reads Kanji fonts from the disk, and draws text as graphic characters on 1024×768 high resolution monitor. The JX extends IBM PCjr and IBM PC architecture. It supports English and Japanese versions of PC DOS with 720×512 resolution monitor. Both machines couldn&#x27;t break dominant NEC&#x27;s PC-98 in consumer market in Japan. Because the 5550 was expensive, it was mostly sold for large enterprises who used IBM&#x27;s mainframe. The JX used 8088 processor instead of faster 8086 processor because IBM thought a consumer-class JX mustn&#x27;t surpass a business-class 5550. It damaged buyer&#x27;s reputations whatever the actual speed was. In another point, a software company said IBM was uncooperative for developing JX software. IBM Japan planned a 100% PC/AT compatible machine codenamed &quot;JX2&quot;, but cancelled it in 1986.

Masahiko Hatori was a developer of JX&#x27;s DOS. Through the development of JX, he learned the skills needed to localize an English computer into Japanese. In 1987, he started developing the DOS/V during spare time at IBM Yamato Development Laboratory. He thought the 480-line mode of VGA and a processor as fast as the 80386 would realize his idea, but they were expensive hardwares as of 1987. In this era, Toshiba released the J-3100 laptop computer, and Microsoft introduced the AX architecture. IBM Japan didn&#x27;t join in the AX consortium. His boss, Tsutomu Maruyama , thought IBM&#x27;s headquarters wouldn&#x27;t allow to adopt the AX because they requested IBM Japan to use the same standard as worldwide IBM offices used. In October 1987, IBM Japan released the PS/55 Model 5535 which was a proprietary laptop using a special version of DOS. It was more expensive than the J-3100 because its LCD display used a non-standard 720×512 resolution. Hatori thought IBM needed to shift their own proprietary PC to IBM PC compatibles. Maruyama and Nobuo Mii thought Japan&#x27;s closed PC market needed to be changed and this attempt couldn&#x27;t be done by IBM alone. In summer of 1989, they decided to carry out the development of DOS/V, disclose the architecture of PS/55, and found the PC Open Architecture Developers&#x27; Group (OADG).

The DOS/V development team designed the DOS/V to be simple for better scalability and compatibility with original PC DOS. They had difficulty reducing text drawing time. &quot;A stopwatch was a necessity for DOS/V development&quot;, Hatori said.

IBM Japan announced the first version of DOS/V, IBM DOS J4.0/V, on 11 October 1990, and shipped out in November 1990. At the same time, IBM Japan released the PS/55 Model 5535-S, a laptop computer with VGA resolution. The announcement letter stated DOS/V was designed for low-end desktops and laptops of PS/55, but users reported on BBS that they could run DOS/V on IBM PC clones. The development team unofficially confirmed these comments, and modified incompatibilities of DOS/V. It was a secret inside the company because it would prevent sales of PS/55 and meet with opposition. Hatori said,

Maruyama and Mii had to convince IBM&#x27;s branches to agree with the plan. In the beginning of December 1990, Maruyama went to IBM&#x27;s Management Committee, and presented his plan &quot;The low-end PC strategy in Japan&quot;. At the committee, a topic usually took 15 minutes, but his topic took an hour. The plan was finally approved by John Akers.

After the committee, Susumu Furukawa, a president of Microsoft Japan, could make an appointment with IBM Japan to share the source code of DOS/V. On 20 December 1990, IBM Japan announced they founded OADG and Microsoft would supply DOS/V for other PC manufacturers. From 1992 to 1994, many Japanese manufacturers began selling IBM PC clones with DOS/V. Some global PC manufacturers entered into the Japanese market, Compaq in 1992 and Dell in 1993. Fujitsu released IBM PC clones (FMV series) in October 1993, and about 200,000 units were shipped in 1994.

The initial goal of DOS/V was to enable Japanese software to run on laptop computers based on the IBM global standards rather than the domestic computer architecture. As of 1989, the VGA was not common, but they expected the LCD panels with VGA resolution would be affordable within a few years. The DOS/V lacked its software library, so IBM Japan requested third-party companies to port their software to the DOS/V. The PS/55 Model 5535-S was released as a laptop terminal for the corporate sector. They only had to supply a few major business software to the DOS/V.

In March 1991, IBM Japan released the PS/55note Model 5523-S which was the lower-price laptop computer. It was a strategically important product to popularize the DOS/V into the consumer market, and led to the success of subsequent consumer products such as the ThinkPad. However, the DOS/V itself sold much better than the 5523S because advanced users purchased it to build a Japanese language environment on their IBM compatible PCs.

In 1992, IBM Japan released the PS/V (similar to the PS/ValuePoint) and the ThinkPad. They were based upon an architecture closer to PC compatibles, and intended to compete with rivals in the consumer market. As of December 1992, the PS/V was the most selling DOS/V computer. In January 1993, NEC released a new generation of the PC-98 to take back its initiative. NEC advertised that the scrolling speed of the word processor Ichitaro on the PC-9801BX was faster than on the PS/V 2405-W. Yuzuru Takemura of IBM Japan said, &quot;Let us suppose the movement towards Windows is inevitability. Processors and graphics cards will become faster and faster. If the PC-98 holds its architecture, it never beat our machine at speed. Windows is developed for the PC/AT architecture. Kanji glyphs are also supplied as a software font. The only thing IBM have to do is tuning up it for the video card. On the different architecture, it will be hard to tune up Windows&quot;.In 1993, Microsoft Japan released first retail versions of Windows (Windows 3.1) for both DOS/V and PC-98. The DOS/V contributed the dawn of IBM PC clones in Japan, yet PC-98 had kept 50% of market share until 1996. It was turned round by the release of Windows 95.

==Drivers==
Three device drivers enable DBCS code page support in DOS on IBM PC compatibles with VGA; the font driver, the display driver and the input assisted subsystem driver. The font driver loads a complete set of the glyphs from a font file into the extended memory. The display driver sets the 640×480 graphics mode on the VGA, and allocates about 20 KB of the conventional memory for text, called the simulated video buffer. A DOS/V program writes the codes of the characters to the simulated video buffer through DOS output functions, or writes them directly and calls driver&#x27;s function to refresh the screen. The display driver copies the font bitmap data from the extended memory to the actual video memory, corresponding to the simulated video buffer. The input assisted subsystem driver communicates with optional input methods and enables the text editing in the on-the-spot or below-the-spot styles. Without installing these drivers, the DOS/V is equivalent to the generic MS-DOS without DBCS code page support.
* $FONT.SYS – Font driver
* $DISP.SYS – Display driver
* $IAS.SYS – Input assist subsystem (IAS) with front end processor (FEP) support driver
* $PRN.SYS – Printer driver
* $PRNUSER.SYS – Printer driver
* $PRNESCP.SYS – Printer driver for Epson ESC/P J84

==Versions==

In 1988, IBM Japan released a new model of the PS/55 which was based on the PS/2 with Japanese language support. It is equipped with a proprietary video card, the Display Adapter, which has a high resolution text mode and a Japanese character set stored in a ROM on the card. It supports Japanese DOS K3.3, PC DOS 3.3 (English) and OS/2.

IBM DOS J4.0 was released in 1989. It combines Japanese DOS and PC DOS, which runs Japanese DOS as the Japanese mode (PS/55 mode) and PC DOS as the English mode (PS/2 mode). Although it had two separated modes that needed a reboot to switch between them, IBM Japan called it &quot;bilingual&quot;. This version requires the PS/55 display adapter.
The first version of DOS/V, IBM DOS J4.0/V (J4.05/V), was released in the end of 1990. The word &#x27;DOS/V&#x27; was quickly known to Japanese computer industry, but the DOS/V itself didn&#x27;t spread quickly. As of 1991, some small companies sold American or Taiwanese computers in Japan, but DOS J4.0/V caused some issues on PC compatibles. Its EMS driver only supports IBM&#x27;s Expanded Memory Adapter. The input method doesn&#x27;t support the US keyboard nor the Japanese AX keyboard, so it locates some keys at the wrong place. PS/55 keyboards were available from IBM, but it must be used with an AT to PS/2 adapter because AX machines (thus PC/AT clones) generally have the older 5-pin DIN connector. Scrolling text with the common Tseng Labs ET4000 graphics controller makes the screen unreadable. This issue can be fixed by the new codice_1 switch of codice_2 in DOS J4.07/V. &quot;Some VGA clones did not correctly implement the CRTC address wraparound. Most likely those were Super VGAs with more video memory than the original VGA (i.e. more than 256 KB). Software relying on the address wraparound was very rare and therefore the functionality was not necessarily correctly implemented in hardware. On the other hand, the split screen technique was relatively well documented and well understood, and commercial software (especially games) sometimes used it. It was therefore likely to be tested and properly implemented in hardware.&quot;

IBM Japan released DOS J5.0/V in October 1991, and DOS J5.0 in December 1991. DOS J5.0 combines Japanese DOS and DOS/V. This is the last version developed for the PS/55 display adapter. DOS J5.02/V was released in March 1992. It added official support for the IBM PS/2 and the US English layout keyboard.

The development of MS-DOS 5.0/V was delayed because IBM and Microsoft disputed how to implement the API for input methods. It took a few months to make an agreement that the OEM adaptation kit (OAK) of MS-DOS 5.0/V provided both IAS (Input Assist Subsystem) and MKKC (Microsoft Kana-Kanji Conversion). Microsoft planned to add the AX application support into DOS/V, but cancelled it because its beta release was strongly criticized by users for lacking compatibility. Some PC manufacturers couldn&#x27;t wait Microsoft&#x27;s DOS/V. Toshiba developed a DOS/V emulator that could run DOS/V applications on a VGA-equipped J-3100 computer. AST Research Japan and Sharp decided to bundle IBM DOS J5.0/V. Compaq developed own DOS/V drivers, and released their first DOS/V computers in April 1992.

On 10 December 1993, Microsoft Japan and IBM Japan released new versions of DOS/V, MS-DOS 6.2/V Upgrade and PC DOS J6.1/V. Although both were released at the same time, they were separately developed. MS-DOS 6.2/V Upgrade is the only Japanese version of MS-DOS released by Microsoft under its own brand for retail sales. Microsoft Japan continued selling it after Microsoft released MS-DOS 6.22 to resolve patent infringement of DoubleSpace disk compression.

IBM Japan ended support for PC DOS 2000 on 31 January 2001, and Microsoft Japan ended support for MS-DOS on 31 December 2001.

Japanese versions of Windows 2000 and XP have a DOS/V environment in NTVDM. It was removed in Windows Vista.

<text>HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot; was the name ship of her class of eight light cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. She saw a considerable amount of action during the early years of the First World War, participating in the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the Battle of Dogger Bank.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class cruisers were intended to lead destroyer flotillas and defend the fleet against attacks by enemy destroyers. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a deep draught of . Displacement was at normal and at full load. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was powered by four Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of . The turbines used steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about . She carried of fuel oil that gave a range of at .

The main armament of the &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class ships consisted of two BL Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and six QF Mk V guns in waist mountings. They were also fitted with a single QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft gun and four  torpedo tubes in two twin mounts.

==Construction and career==

She was laid down at Chatham Dockyard in October 1912, launched on 25 October 1913, and commissioned in August 1914 as flotilla leader for the Harwich Force. On 28 August 1914, she fought at the Battle of Heligoland Bight, flying the flag of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. She was seriously damaged by the German cruisers and and had to be towed home. On 25 December, &quot;Arethusa&quot; took part in the Cuxhaven Raid and on 24 January 1915 she fought at the Battle of Dogger Bank. Later in the same year, she was transferred to the 5th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Harwich Force. In September 1915, she captured four German trawlers. On 11 February 1916, she struck a mine off Felixstowe, drifted onto a shoal while under tow, and broke her back. Approximately near Harwich (51.925, 1.295) 

== Legacy ==

One of the four relief panels on Brierley Hill War Memorial, in Dudley, England, depicts &quot;Arethusa&quot; sending out its boats to rescue German sailors from a ship it had sunk.

One of &quot;Arethusa&quot;″s 4-inch guns was salvaged from the wreck on 27 March 1916. It was fitted to the yacht &quot;Vittoria&quot;, serving as a minesweeper, until 27 February 1918. It was then taken on by the drill ship HMS &quot;Satellite&quot; on 25 September 1920, where it was used in anti-submarine training until the beginning of the Second World War. It was presented by the shipbreaking firm J. G. Potts to the Armstrong &amp; Aviation Museum at Bamburgh Castle on 16 February 1948, where it remains as of 2024.

<text>Audrey Riley is an English cellist and string arranger.

== Career ==
Riley trained at the Guildhall School of Music with Leonard Stehn. She was a cellist for Virginia Astley from 1983 to 1986 and a one-time auxiliary member of the Family Cat.

Riley has been a member of the post-minimalist band Icebreaker since 1989, and a frequent indie session artist.

During 2002/03, Riley embarked on her own project, entitled A Change of Light, a collaboration between musicians, composers and visual artist Philip Riley, with Andrew Zolinsky (piano), James Woodrow (guitar), Nick Allum (The Fatima Mansions, the Apartments, Cathal Coughlan) and Rob Allum (High Llamas, Turin Brakes) both on drums, to present music for cello in an expanded recital. New works have been written by composers Gavin Bryars, David Lang, Steve Hillier (Dubstar), Mark Brydon (Moloko), Emma Anderson (Lush), Cathal Coughlan, Piet Goddaer (Ozark Henry), David Gavurin, Harriet Wheeler (The Sundays) and Damian le Gassick. After many performances in art galleries and venues in the UK, the project was recorded in 2003/04 for a combined CD/DVD release, with a second series being subsequently developed.

She took part in the first performance of a new work, &quot;Views&quot;, with music by Cage, performing with the experimental Japanese violinist Takahisa Kosugi and the composer Christian Wolff which toured throughout Europe in 2005–6.

In 2014, Riley joined London music college the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance as the tutor for arrangement classes.

==Work==
As an arranger and improvising session cellist she has recorded for two decades with numerous groups including The Style Council (&quot;A Stones Throw Away&quot;), the Smiths (&quot;Stop Me&quot;), Nick Cave (on &quot;Tender Prey&quot;), Dubstar, The Cure, The Go-Betweens, The Sundays, Lush, the Smashing Pumpkins (for whom she conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra strings) and Dave Matthews (for whom she conducted the Seattle Symphony Orchestra in eight of her arrangements for the album &quot;Some Devil&quot;), as well as live and television appearances with many others. She has contributed her playing and arrangements to new albums by Foo Fighters (&quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot;), Coldplay (&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; and &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;), Feeder (&quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;, &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; and &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot;), Muse (&quot;Absolution&quot;, &quot;Black Holes &amp; Revelations&quot;, &quot;The Resistance&quot; and &quot;Drones&quot;), Moloko (&quot;Statues&quot;) and Fightstar (&quot;Be Human&quot;).

She has worked extensively with dance companies including Siobhan Davies, Royal Scottish Ballet and Random Dance. Since 2001 she has toured with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company performing Gavin Bryars &quot;Bi-ped&quot; and the solo work for cello, &quot;One8&quot; by John Cage, in Paris, Mullhouse, Berlin, Dublin, Reykjavik, Bergen, Hong Kong, Brazil and at The Barbican Centre, London.

<text>A stamp act is any legislation that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents. Those who pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents, making them legal documents. A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including playing cards, dice, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts, marriage licenses and newspapers. The items may have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common.

This system of taxation was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax. Stamp acts have been enforced in many countries, including Australia, Canada, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The taxes raised under a stamp act are called stamp duty.

==Australia==

Stamps acts were enacted in various Australian states in 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, and 1894, with amendments from 1892 to 1907. According to these acts, stamps were required on many types of business transactions: negotiable instruments, promissory notes, bills of lading, and receipts.

In Western Australia, duties of this type were overhauled in the Western Australian Stamp Act 1921, which took effect on 1 January 2010. In South Australia, the Stamp Duties Act 1923 was first enacted in 1923, then revised or amended almost yearly until its current version of 2017.

==United Kingdom==

===Stamps Act 1694===



A stamp duty was first introduced in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as &quot;An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper for four years, towards carrying on the war against France&quot; (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 21). The duty ranged between 1 penny to several shillings on a number of different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, grants of honour, grants of probate and letters of administration. It raised around £50,000 a year and although it was initially a temporary measure, it proved so successful that its use was continued.

===Stamp Act 1712===


The Stamp Act 1712 was an act passed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 1712 to create a new tax on publishers, particularly of newspapers. The initial assessed rate of tax was one penny per whole newspaper sheet, a halfpenny for a half sheet, and one shilling per advertisement contained within. Other than newspapers, it required that all pamphlets, legal documents, commercial bills, advertisements, and other papers be issued the tax. The act was increased in 1797 with greater taxes and wider spectrum of materials affected, reached its height around 1815 during the &quot;taxes on knowledge&quot; struggle, reduced in 1836, and repealed in 1855.

The stamp tax was a tax on each newspaper and thus hit cheaper papers and popular readership harder than wealthy consumers, because it formed a higher proportion of the purchase price. The act had a chilling effect on publishers; the tax is blamed for the decline of English literature critical of the government during the period, notably with &quot;The Spectator&quot; ending the same year of the tax&#x27;s enactment. Its repeal in 1855 allowed a cheap press again.

=== Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 and Stamp Act 1891===

The above act were superseded by the Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. 38) and the Stamp Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. 39), which still constitute the bulk of UK law on stamp duties today.

===The modern UK Stamp Act===

From 1914 to 1928, the Director of Stamping at the Stamp Office oversaw the production of &quot;Treasury Notes&quot; (a type of banknote, not to be confused with US Treasury notes). These were issued for denominations of £1 and 10&#x27;s to enable coins to be removed from circulation and were not convertible to gold. Existing Bank of England banknotes in higher denominations continued to circulate alongside the Treasury Notes. In 1963 production of postage stamps passed to the General Post Office.

The Finance Act 1986 introduced Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. From October 27, 1986, the charge was imposed on &#x27;closing&#x27; transactions at the London Stock Exchange which until then had been transactions where no document was used and therefore exempt from Stamp Duty.

A public display of Stamp Office artifacts and records was held at the Courtauld Institute in 1994 to commemorate the three hundredth anniversary of the introduction of UK Stamp Duty. The Stamp Office was also awarded the Charter Mark by John Major&#x27;s Advisory Committee as a reward for its public service.

Stamp duties are the oldest taxes still raised by the HM Revenue and Customs.

==Israel==
Israel used to have a stamp duty on signed documents, which was regulated by the 1961 &quot;Stamp Tax on Documents&quot; (Law 5731-1961), the 1965 &quot;Stamp Tax on Documents Regulations&quot;, and subsequent Additions. The stamp duty was repealed as of 2006.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==
As part of domestic taxation, the PRC includes a stamp tax as one of the &quot;behavioural taxes&quot;. Foreign investors are also subject to a stamp tax. Stamp taxes in China are governed by &quot;Provisional Regulations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Concerning Stamp Tax Detailed Rules for Its Implementation&quot;, implemented in 1988. In 1997, stamp taxes produced revenue of 26.63 billion yuan and comprised 3.6% of China&#x27;s gross domestic product.

==United States==

===Stamp Act 1765===

After Great Britain was victorious over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War – which manifested in America as the French and Indian War – a small Stamp Act was enacted that covered all sorts of documents. The Stamp Act 1765 (short title &quot;Duties in American Colonies Act 1765&quot;; 5 Geo. 3. c. 12) was a direct tax imposed by the British Parliament on the colonies of British America. The act required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London and carrying an embossed revenue stamp. These printed materials were on every legal document, magazine, and newspaper, plus many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, including playing cards. Unlike previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.

The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America. The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and the colonial population should pay at least a portion of the expense. The colonists claimed their constitutional rights were violated since only their own colonial legislatures could levy taxes. The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent. Some opponents of the Stamp Act distinguished between &quot;internal&quot; taxes like the stamp duty, which they claimed Parliament had no right to impose, and revenue legitimately raised through the regulation on trade. In general, however, most colonists considered the Act to be a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent – consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant because Americans were unrepresented in Parliament. The rallying cry of &quot;No Taxation without Representation&quot; reflected an increasingly major grievance that led to the American Revolution. The Americans saw no need for the troops or the taxes; the British saw colonial defiance of their lawful rulers.

The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests. Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence – the so-called &quot;Committees of Correspondence – that created a loose coalition extending from New England to Georgia. British goods were boycotted. Opposition to the tax also took the form of violence and intimidation. Custom houses and tax collectors were attacked. Protests and demonstrations initiated by the newly formed Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved. A word used frequently by colonists was &quot;liberty&quot; during the Stamp Act upheaval. Opponents of the new tax staged mock funerals in which &quot;liberty&#x27;s&quot; coffin was carried to a burial ground. They insisted that liberty could not be &quot;taken away without consent.&quot;

A more reasoned approach was taken by some elements. James Otis, Jr. wrote the most influential protest, &quot;The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved&quot;. Otis, the radical leader in Massachusetts, convinced the Massachusetts assembly to send a circular letter to the other colonies, which called for an inter-colonial meeting to plan tempered resistance. The Stamp Act Congress convened in New York City on October 7, 1765, with nine colonies in attendance; others would likely have participated if earlier notice had been provided. The Stamp Act Congress was another step in the process of attempted common problem-solving. The Albany Congress in 1754 had been held at the urging of royal officials as a forum for voicing constitutional concerns and afforded the more conservative critics of British policy some hope of regaining control of events from the unruly mobs in the streets of many cities; in contrast, the Stamp Act Congress was strictly a colonial affair, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure. Delegates to the Stamp Act Congress approved a fourteen-point &quot;Declaration of Rights and Grievances&quot; as a petition to the Parliament and the King, formulated largely by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania. The statement echoed the recent resolves of the Virginia House of Burgesses, which argued that colonial taxation could only be carried on by their own assemblies. The delegates singled out the Stamp Act and the use of the vice-admiralty courts for special criticism, yet ended their statement with a pledge of loyalty to the King.

Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies. In Canada, Nova Scotia largely ignored the Act; they allowed ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. Newfoundland experienced some protests and petitions based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries. The Caribbean colonies also protested. Political opposition was expressed in a number of colonies, including Barbados and Antigua, and by absentee landowners living in Britain. The worst violence took place on St. Kitts and Nevis, with rioting and blockage of stamp delivery. Montserrat and Antigua also succeeded in avoiding the use of stamps. In Jamaica there was also vocal opposition, and much evasion of the stamps. British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial boycotts, also pressured Parliament.

The act was repealed in early 1766, although the Declaratory Act maintained Parliament&#x27;s right to tax the colonies.

===Revival===
&quot;Revenue stamps&quot; were revived in the United States during the American Civil War. In 1862, the United States (Union) government began taxing a variety of goods, services, and legal dealings, in an effort to raise revenue for the great costs of the war. To confirm that taxes were paid a &quot;revenue stamp&quot; was purchased and appropriately affixed to the taxable item. This excise tax continued until the federal government finished paying the war debt in 1883, at which time the tax was repealed.

In 1898, revenue stamps were again issued, to provide funding for the Spanish–American War. Tax was levied on a wide range of goods and services including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions such as stock certificates, bills of lading, manifests, and marine insurance. To pay these tax duties revenue tax stamps were purchased and affixed to the taxable item or respective certificate.

Revenue stamps were issued at irregular intervals for alcohol products, tobacco products, matches, proprietary medicines, and perfumes. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.

<doc id="978997" wikidata="Q663596" url="?curid=978997" title="Gilead Sciences">
<text>Gilead Sciences, Inc. () is an American biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Foster City, California, that focuses on researching and developing antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza, and COVID-19, including ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir. Gilead is a member of the Nasdaq-100 and the S&amp;P 100.

Gilead was founded in 1987 under the name Oligogen by Michael L. Riordan. The original name was a reference to oligonucleotides, small strands of DNA used to target genetic sequences. Gilead held its initial public offering in 1992, and successfully developed drugs like Tamiflu and Vistide that decade.

In the 2000s, Gilead received approval for drugs including Viread and Hepsera, among others. It began evolving from a biotechnology company into a pharmaceutical company, acquiring several subsidiaries, though it still relied heavily on contracting to manufacture its drugs.

The company continued its growth in the 2010s. However, it came under heavy scrutiny over its business practices, including extremely high pricing of drugs such as Sovaldi and Truvada in the United States relative to production cost and cost in the developing world.

==History==
===Foundation===
In June 1987, Gilead Sciences was originally founded under the name Oligogen by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor. Riordan graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and the Harvard Business School. The idea for Gilead began as a research project at Menlo Ventures, where Michael was an associate. Three scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company: Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold M. Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, along with H. Dubose Montgomery, one of Menlo Ventures founders. Riordan served as CEO from the company&#x27;s founding until 1996. Menlo Ventures subsequently made the first investment in Gilead of $2 million. Riordan also recruited scientific advisers, including Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.

The company&#x27;s primary therapeutic focus was in antiviral medicines, a field that piqued Riordan&#x27;s interest after he contracted dengue fever. Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member but was unsuccessful.

The company focused its early research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers, or more particularly, oligonucleotides) to target specific genetic code sequences – that is, antisense therapy, a form of gene therapy. According to Riordan, he had always wanted to use the name Gilead Sciences all along. Still, he used Oligogen as a temporary name because he needed to deal with a trademark clearance issue with a California nonprofit organization that was already using the word Gilead in its name. He had first heard of the Balm of Gilead when he read Lanford Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; while in medical school, then learned that naturally occurring acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) had been found in modern times in a willow tree species from that part of that world, and was therefore inspired to name his company Gilead. After founding Oligogen, he contacted the nonprofit about the naming issue and secured the right to use the Gilead Sciences name in exchange for a $1,000 donation.

By 1988, the company had moved its headquarters to Foster City&#x27;s Vintage Park neighborhood, where it has been based ever since. The company began to develop small molecule antiviral therapeutics in 1991, when the company in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds including tenofovir.

Riordan later recalled that Gilead&#x27;s first decade as a startup was an extremely stressful experience for him, as a young venture capitalist serving for the first time as the founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of his own biotech company. The new company had no products and very little income, and narrowly escaped going out of business on several occasions: &quot;It was touch and go for a long time&quot;. Finding a way for Gilead to make money was Riordan&#x27;s top priority &quot;every second of the day for eight years&quot;.

===1990–1999: IPO===
Gilead&#x27;s antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Ionis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.

In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS.

In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld was appointed chairman, but left the board in January 2001 when he was appointed United States Secretary of Defense during George W. Bush&#x27;s first term as president.

In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado. At the time, NeXstar&#x27;s annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead&#x27;s sales; it sold AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. That same year, Roche announced FDA approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.

One reason for entering into the Tamiflu licensing agreement was that with only 350 employees, Gilead still did not yet have the capability to sell its drugs directly to overseas buyers. To avoid having to license future drugs in order to access international markets, Gilead simply acquired the 480-employee NeXstar, which had already built its own sales force in Europe to market AmBisome there.

===2000 to 2009===

Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.

In 2002, Gilead changed its corporate strategy to focus exclusively on antivirals, and sold its cancer assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals for $200 million.

In December 2002, Gilead and Triangle Pharmaceuticals announced that Gilead would acquire Triangle for around $464 million; Triangle&#x27;s lead drug was emtricitabine that was near FDA approval, and it had two other antivirals in its pipeline. The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year, Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.

During this era, Gilead completed its gradual evolution from a biotech startup into a pharmaceutical company. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted that by 2003, the Gilead corporate campus in Foster City had expanded to &quot;seven low-slung sand-colored buildings around a tiny lake on which ducks happily paddle.&quot; Like many startups, Gilead originally leased its space, but in 2004, the company paid $123 million to buy all its headquarters buildings from its landlords. However, even as Gilead developed its ability to distribute and sell its own drugs, it remained distinct from most pharmaceutical companies in terms of its strong reliance on subcontracting most of its manufacturing to contract manufacturing organizations.

In 2004, during the Avian flu pandemic scare, Gilead Sciences&#x27; revenue from Tamiflu almost quadrupled to $44.6m as more than 60 national governments stockpiled the antiviral drug, though the firm had made a loss in 2003 before concern about the flu started. As stocks soared, US Defense Secretary and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld sold shares of the company, receiving more than $5 million in capital gains, while still maintaining up to $25m-worth of shares by the end of the year. Sales of Tamiflu almost quadrupled again in 2005, to $161.6m, during which time the share price tripled. A 2005 report showed that, in all, Rumsfeld owned shares worth up to $95.9m, from which he got an income of up to $13m.

In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead&#x27;s entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.

In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.

Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006, for a price of . Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.

Later in the same year, Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then its largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead&#x27;s position in this therapeutic arena. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan, also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.

Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.

In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead&#x27;s cardiovascular franchise. Later that year, the company was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies by &quot;Fortune&quot;.

===2010 to 2019===

In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead&#x27;s research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.

In February 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead&#x27;s oncology and inflammation areas. Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition – and by then most expensive – with the purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).

In October 2011, Gilead broke ground on a massive multi-year expansion of its 17-building headquarters campus in Foster City. By replacing eight one or two-story buildings with seven new structures ranging as tall as 10 stories, Gilead nearly doubled its headquarters real estate footprint from about 620,000 square feet to about 1.2 million square feet.

On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead&#x27;s Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.

In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead&#x27;s oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.

In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:
* It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
* It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.
* It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn&#x27;s disease.

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Also in 2016, the company was named the most generous company on the 2016 &quot;Fortune&quot; list of The Most Generous Companies of the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500. Charitable donations to HIV/AIDS and liver disease organizations totaled over 440 million in 2015.

In August 2017, the company announced it would acquire Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion, equating to $180 cash per share, a 29% premium over the closing price of the shares. The deal was Gilead&#x27;s entry into the cell therapy market and added a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy candidate to the company&#x27;s portfolio. By 2022 this acquisition had led to two marketed products for lymphoma: Yescarta and Tecartus. In November, the company announced it will acquire Cell Design Labs for up to $567 million, after it indirectly acquired a stake of 12.2% via the Kite Pharma deal.

On May 9, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that Gilead Sciences will donate Truvada, the only drug approved to prevent infection with H.I.V., for free to 200,000 patients annually for 11 years. On December 3, 2019, HHS explained how the government would distribute the donated drugs. HHS Secretary Alex Azar explained that the U.S. government will pay Gilead $200 per bottle for 30 pills for costs associated with getting the drug from factories into the eventual hands of patients.

===2020 onwards===
In March 2020, the company announced it would acquire Forty Seven Inc. for $95.50 a share ($4.9 billion in total). On April 7, 2020, Gilead completed acquisition of Forty Seven, Inc. for &quot;$95.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, or approximately $4.9 billion in the aggregate.&quot;

In June 2020, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that AstraZeneca Plc had made a preliminary approach to Gilead for a potential merger, worth almost $240 billion. In the same month, the company announced it would acquire a 49.9% stake in privately held Pionyr Immunotherapeutics Inc for $275 million.

In September 2020, Gilead announced it had reached a deal to acquire Immunomedics for $21 billion ($88 per share), gaining control of the cancer treatment Trodelvy (Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) – a first-in-class Trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate. In December, the business announced it would acquire German biotech, MYR GmbH, for €1.15 billion plus up to a further €300 million. MYR focuses on the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus.

On August 11, 2021, U.S. Senator Rand Paul disclosed that his wife Kelley Paul had purchased a stake in Gilead Sciences on February 26, 2020.

In November 2021, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

In January 2022, Gilead pulled its cancer drug Zydelig (idelalisib) from its accelerated approval in relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and relapsed small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL). In September, the company completed its acquisition of MiroBio for $405 million.

In February 2023, the business, through Kite Pharma completed its acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics In May, the business announced it would acquire XinThera and its small molecule inhibitors.

In February 2024, the company acquired CymaBay Therapeutics, and in September, paid Genesis Therapeutics $35 million for AI-based drug discovery work.

==Treatments for hepatitis C==
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as &quot;one of the best pharma acquisitions ever&quot;. Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year&#x27;s final quarter would be $53 million, and &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the &quot;potentially revolutionary&quot; drug as a positive indicator for the stock.

On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi&#x27;s high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating &quot;efficiently and rationally&quot;, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug. The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price. For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill&#x27;s price was as low as $4.29.

Gilead later combined Sovaldi with other antivirals in single-pill combinations. First, Sovaldi was combined with ledipasvir and marketed as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1). By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased. Later single-pill combinations were Epclusa (with velpatasvir) and Vosevi (with velpatasvir and voxilaprevir).

==Finances==
For the fiscal year 2017, Gilead Sciences reported earnings of US$4.628 billion and annual revenue of US$26.107 billion, a decline of 14.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Gilead Sciences&#x27;s shares traded at over $70 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$93.4 billion in October 2018.
===Prospects for the future===
As of 2017, Gilead&#x27;s challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Gilead benefited from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead&#x27;s HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals. Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it. Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.

Gilead&#x27;s Entospletinib has shown a 90% complete response rate for MLL type acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

==Criticisms==
=== TAF development delays ===
Several mass tort lawsuits have been filed against Gilead alleging that the company deliberately delayed development of antiretroviral drugs based on tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) in order to maximize profits from previous-generation medications containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Plaintiffs allege that Gilead suspended TAF in 2004 despite clear evidence indicating that TAF-based medications were safer than TDF, a compound whose long-term use was associated with adverse side effects such as nephrotoxicity and bone density loss.

Gilead&#x27;s first TAF medication, marketed under the trade name Genvoya, came out in 2015. Lawsuits allege that in the interim period, many HIV patients who continuously took Gilead&#x27;s older TDF-based drugs suffered severe side effects, including nephrotoxicity.

=== Pricing ===

==== Biktarvy ====
In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Biktarvy&#x27;s wholesale acquisition cost rose by 5.49%, leading to an additional $815 million in costs to U.S. payers.

==== Sovaldi ====
Gilead came under intense criticism for its high pricing of its patented drug sofosbuvir (sold under the brand name Sovaldi), used to treat hepatitis C. In the US, for instance, it was launched at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the standard 84-day course, but it was drastically cheaper in the developing world; in India, it dropped as low as $4.29 per pill. While Sovaldi represented a significant improvement over contemporary treatments, the controversy surrounding its price ignited a national debate in the US, according to Reuters.

The United States Senate Committee on Finance launched an 18-month investigation of Gilead&#x27;s Sovaldi pricing, and argued in its 2015 report that Gilead set prices high in disregard of the human cost and in order to set the stage for a higher eventual price for Sovaldi&#x27;s successor, Harvoni. The committee&#x27;s investigation, based in part on internal documents obtained from Gilead, revealed that the company had considered prices ranging from $50,000 to $115,000 per year, trying to strike a balance between revenue and predicted activist and public relations blowback, with little regard to research and development costs.

The high prices forced state Medicaid programs to ration treatment to patients, delaying treatment of less advanced hepatitis C cases. In Oregon, for example, 10,000 Medicaid patients were deemed good candidates for Sovaldi therapy, but the Oregon Health Authority estimated that treating half of these patients would more than double the state&#x27;s total drug expenditures. The state thus opted to limit treatment to 500 patients per year.

====Truvada and Descovy====
Truvada was introduced to the market by Gilead in 2004 to treat HIV infections. In the following years, the United States government conducted research demonstrating that Truvada was able to prevent HIV infection. The US Centers for Disease Control holds the patent for this use of Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP).

Gilead introduced Truvada for PreP in 2012, at which point a prescription cost approximately $1,200 per month in the United States. By 2018, this price had increased to up to $2,000, despite generally costing less than $100 outside the U.S. Gilead made over $3 billion in sales of Truvada in 2018.

The high price drew the ire of activist groups such as ACT UP and was the subject of a Congressional hearing in May 2019. Gilead&#x27;s CEO defended its pricing in the hearing by noting the large sums the company spends on HIV/AIDS research. Activists pressured the US government to enforce its patent on Truvada in order to combat the high prices set by Gilead.

In May 2019, Gilead announced it would donate enough Truvada to treat up to 200,000 patients annually for up to 11 years, the result of discussions with the Department of Health and Human Services under Trump. Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted that the donations still covered less than one-fifth of the people who need the drug, and argued it was possibly a move to help the company market Descovy, a more advanced successor drug. Walensky led a 2020 study that concluded the high costs of Descovy would on the whole negate any comparative advantage of prescribing it over a generic Truvada alternative.

In July 2021, Gilead announced it would decrease 340B Drug Pricing Program reimbursements to clinics serving primarily low-income communities; clinics argued this severely hinders their ability to provide HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services among vulnerable populations.

=== Anticompetitive behavior ===

Gilead has also been accused of stifling competition. A lawsuit filed in the United States in 2019 alleged that the company entered &quot;pay for delay&quot; agreements with other manufacturers, wherein the manufacturers agreed to delay releasing generic versions of Truvada. In 2021, CVS Pharmacy and RiteAid filed a lawsuit on similar grounds against Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2021.

In response to criticisms over the price of Sovaldi, Gilead began licensing the rights to produce generic versions of the drug to select producers in India in 2015. Included in the licensing agreements were &#x27;anti-diversion&#x27; provisions, designed to prevent the drug from being exported back to developed countries where the cheaper, generic alternatives were still unavailable. (In India, a one-month treatment cost approximately US$300, versus $1,000 per pill in the United States.) Gilead required the Indian producers to screen patients to determine who could buy Sovaldi, which was criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières since it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups like refugees and migrants from accessing the medicines. In response to the criticism, Gilead eventually relaxed these requirements.

===Tax structures and tax avoidance===
Gilead has been criticized for tax avoidance. Tax avoidance, as opposed to tax evasion, is the use of legal means to shift tax burdens from the one jurisdiction to overseas affiliates that pay a lower tax rate, even if revenue is primarily generated outside the overseas jurisdiction.

A 2016 report by the liberal think tank Americans for Tax Fairness argued that Gilead was able to avoid up to $10 billion in taxes on U.S. sales through mechanisms such as transfer pricing, the sale of assets between affiliated entities. In particular, Gilead sells intellectual property to an Irish subsidiary, which then sells the finished products, such as Sovaldi, in the United States and elsewhere, paying the low Irish tax rate on profits. The practice is common among multinational pharmaceutical companies like Gilead.

On December 26, 2018, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Gilead had used the Double Irish arrangement to avoid U.S. corporate taxes on global profits, stating that the firm &quot;used a controversial tax loophole arrangement to shift almost in profits through an Irish entity in just two years&quot; without paying Irish taxes. The company repatriated a portion of the Irish subsidiary&#x27;s holdings, $28 billion, to the United States in 2018 following reductions of the corporate tax rate. For this it paid an estimated $5.5 billion in tax.

== Remdesivir ==

Gilead sought and obtained orphan drug designation for remdesivir from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 23, 2020. This designation is intended to encourage the development of drugs affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans by granting strengthened and extended legal monopoly rights to the manufacturer, along with waivers on taxes and government fees.

Remdesivir became a candidate for treating COVID-19; at the time the status was granted, fewer than 200,000 Americans had COVID-19, but numbers were climbing rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic reached the US, and crossing the threshold soon was considered inevitable. Gilead retains 20-year remdesivir patents in more than 70 countries.

In 2021, remdesivir (tradename &quot;Veklury&quot;) generated more than $4.5 billion in annual revenues, and was Gilead&#x27;s highest selling product.

===COVID-19===

Emergency use authorization for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on May 1, 2020, for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19. In September 2020 following a review of the evidence, the WHO issued guidance not to use remdesivir for people with COVID-19, as there was no good evidence of benefit. However, over 2020–22 with further clinical research, remdesivir had been approved for treatment of hospitalized people with COVID-19 in the United States, European Union, and multiple other countries. In 2022, the Canadian component of the WHO international Solidarity Trial reported that in-hospital people with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir had lower death rates (by about 4%) and reduced need for oxygen and mechanical ventilation compared to people receiving standard-of-care treatments.

====Regulatory approval====
&quot;Veklury&quot; received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2020 use in hospitalized adults and children 12 years and older for treatment of severe COVID-19 infections. In January 2022, the FDA gave regulatory approval to &quot;Veklury&quot; for use in adults and children (12 years of age and older who weigh at least and are positive for COVID-19, not hospitalized, and are ill having high risk for developing severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

The FDA also provided Emergency Use Authorization for &quot;Veklury&quot; treatment of children under age 12 who are COVID-positive and not hospitalized, but have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with high risk of developing severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

<text>Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life (published in the US, and UK second edition as What Does a Martian Look Like?: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life) is a 2002 popular science book about xenobiology by biologist Jack Cohen and mathematician Ian Stewart.

The concept for the book originated with a lecture that Cohen had revised over many years, which he called POLOOP, for &quot;Possibility of Life on Other Planets&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Cohen and Stewart argue against a conception of extraterrestrial life that assumes life can only evolve in environments similar to Earth (the so-called Rare Earth hypothesis), and that extraterrestrial lifeforms will converge toward characteristics similar to those of life on Earth, a common trope of certain science fiction styles. They suggest that any investigation of extraterrestrial life relying on these assumptions is overly restrictive, and it is possible to make a scientific and rational study of the possibility of life forms that are so different from life on Earth that we may not even recognise them as life in the first instance.

Cohen and Stewart return to two contrasts throughout the book. The first is between &quot;exobiology&quot; (which considers the possibilities for conventional, Earth-like biology on Earth-like planets) and &quot;xenoscience&quot; (which embraces a much broader and more speculative range for the forms that life may take). The second contrast drawn is between &quot;parochials&quot; (features of life that are likely to be unique to Earth) and &quot;universals&quot; (features that are likely to appear wherever life arises).

Cohen and Stewart supplement the limited hard science available on their subject with numerous references to science fiction of both their own and others&#x27; creation, including 28 plot summaries of classic SF stories.

==Reception==
In its review of &quot;Evolving the Alien&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; commented that Cohen and Stewart&#x27;s speculative approach is useful in exposing errors in conventional thinking, and is &quot;painlessly educative&quot; on the current state of the applicable sciences, but criticized their &quot;naive optimism&quot; with respect to future technological breakthroughs in human space travel.

In his review for &quot;Nature&quot;, Lawrence M. Krauss admitted to not being completely sure of the book&#x27;s intended goal and audience, but noted that it may serve as a counterpoint to arguments put forth in Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee&#x27;s book, &quot;Rare Earth&quot;.

<text>KwaZulu was a semi-independent Bantustan in South Africa, intended by the apartheid government as a homeland for the Zulu people. The capital was moved from Nongoma to Ulundi in 1980.

It was led until its abolition in 1994 by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and head of Inkatha, who implemented the limited self-governing powers decided by the South African government as part of apartheid, but rejected the nominal independence which four other homelands accepted, complaining about the fragmented nature of the state, and the inability of the apartheid government to consolidate a viable and contiguous territory for KwaZulu, in the face of stiff resistance from whites. F. W. de Klerk later commented in an interview that he believed that Buthelezi would have accepted independence had his homeland been given the port of Richards Bay, a proposal that failed due to the white population&#x27;s resistance to the idea.

An attempt to transfer parts of the homeland, along with parts of the Swazi homeland KaNgwane, to the neighbouring country of Swaziland (now Eswatini) in 1982 was never realized. This would have given land-locked Swaziland access to the sea. The deal was negotiated by the governments of South Africa and Swaziland, but was met by popular opposition in the territory meant to be transferred. The territory had been claimed by King Sobhuza of Swaziland as part of the Swazi monarchs&#x27; traditional realm, and the South African government hoped to use the homeland as a buffer zone against guerrilla infiltration from Mozambique. South Africa responded to the failure of the transfer by temporarily suspending the autonomy of KaNgwane, then restoring it in December 1982 and granting it nominal self-rule in 1984.

KwaZulu was merged with the surrounding South African province of Natal to form the new province of KwaZulu-Natal.

The name &quot;kwaZulu&quot; translates roughly as &quot;Place of Zulus&quot;, or more formally &quot;Zululand&quot;.

In March 1996, two years after South Africa&#x27;s transition to majority rule, the trial of &quot;The State v. Peter Msane &amp; Others&quot; was held due to the accusation against thirteen retired white generals, including Magnus Malan (who served as defence minister at the height of emergency rule in the mid-1980s) and seven Zulus, partisans of Buthelezi&#x27;s Inkatha Freedom Party of complicity in a massacre of thirteen people, ten years earlier, in a rural village in the KwaZulu homeland known as KwaMakhutha. The trial was an attempt by Nelson Mandela&#x27;s new government to bring to justice those at the top of apartheid&#x27;s security forces. They were alleged to have purposefully fanned violence among blacks by arming and training one faction as a proxy force, in the tradition of divide and rule. However, all of the defendants were acquitted.

<text>Cocky is the fifth studio album by American musician Kid Rock. Released in 2001, it is his third release for Atlantic Records.

The album is known for featuring the ballad &quot;Picture&quot;, recorded as a duet with Sheryl Crow. In May 2011, the album was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA and has sold 5,344,000 copies in the US as of December 2013. According to Kid Rock&#x27;s official website that made a timeline for his 45th birthday in January 2016, &quot;Cocky&quot; was certified 6× platinum on August 26, 2008. However, RIAA only certified the album at 5× platinum.

The album was dedicated to Rock&#x27;s former assistant and hype man Joe C., who died in November of the previous year from celiac disease complications. 75 songs were written for the album, but only 30 of them were recorded as a song for the album. One of the recorded songs that did not make the album was &quot;If I Was President&quot;, a standard blues song that Kid Rock plays frequently in concert. Another song left off the album was the Joe C. eulogy &quot;In Your Lifetime&quot;. &quot;Picture&quot; received a CMA nomination in 2003 for Vocal Event of the Year and would go on to be Rock&#x27;s first gold single. Some of the songs that were recorded during this album&#x27;s sessions appeared on Kid Rock&#x27;s self-titled album.

==Music==
&quot;Cocky&quot; saw a shift in Kid Rock&#x27;s sound, featuring more ballads and less rapping than the preceding albums; the album also has more of a classic rock influence.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Rob Brunner described &quot;Cocky&quot; as a concept album, stating, &quot;Boastful and defensive, confrontational and thin-skinned, loud, rude, and proud of it, Kid Rock is a composite of blatantly unpleasant stereotypes sure to scare the neighbors: strutting ghetto pimp, Skynyrd-loving redneck, heavy metal burnout.&quot;

&quot;Trucker Anthem&quot; contains a sample from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Brunner described &quot;Midnight Train to Memphis&quot; as MOR country, and &quot;Lonely Road of Faith&quot; as a power ballad.

&quot;You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me&quot; makes lyrical references to Hank Williams Jr., ZZ Top&#x27;s Billy Gibbons, Run-DMC&#x27;s Joseph Simmons, and Willie Nelson.

The single song Cocky was also used for WWF Royal Rumble.

==Reception==
&quot;Cocky&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 57 out of 100 rating on Metacritic.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, gave the album four out of five stars, writing, &quot;unpretentious, blue-collar hard rock hasn&#x27;t sounded this good in nearly 20 years, and that&#x27;s reason enough to celebrate.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Rob Brunner gave the album a B, writing, &quot;Kid Rock&#x27;s tear-down-the-walls ideal of a world where rappers can sip whiskey with rednecks is a compelling fiction, and if the cross-pollinated musical results aren&#x27;t always as exciting as the conversation no doubt would be, you have to at least admire the breadth of his vision.&quot; Brunner felt that &quot;Too much of &quot;Cocky&quot; meanders into boring stylistic experiments&quot;, calling &quot;Picture&quot; a &quot;sappy duet&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Barry Walters gave &quot;Cocky&quot; three out of five stars, writing, &quot;Rock self-consciously builds on his badass-hick-with-a-heart-of-gold image [...] [The execution] is really corn, [...] Rock&#x27;s AC/DC, Run-D.M.C. and Lynyrd Skynyrd. tributes now come across as clunky imitation.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The album&#x27;s first single was the rap rock track &quot;Forever&quot;. The song charted at number 18 on Mainstream Rock and number 21 on Modern Rock. He performed the song on TRL and The Late Show with David Letterman, leading to a number 8 debut (it would climb to number 3 after release of Picture). He and Hank Williams Jr would perform on CMT Crossroads in late 2001. The second single was the ballad &quot;Lonely Road of Faith&quot;, released in January 2002. The song was heavily promoted by WWE in the video tribute to the History of WWE. The song was also heard on WB&#x27;s Smallville and MTV&#x27;s Real World. Kid Rock would go on &quot;The Cocky Tour&quot; then join Aerosmith and Run DMC on the &quot;Girls Of Summer Tour&quot;. The song would peak at number 15 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. In July 2002, a censored version of &quot;You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me&quot; was released to radio and peaked at number 32 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. Kid Rock would test out &quot;Picture&quot; at CMT&#x27;s Farm Aid with Allison Moorer filling in for Sheryl Crow. When Sheryl Crow&#x27;s label butted heads with Rock he released the song in November 2002 with Allison Moorer. As the Allison Moorer version began climbing the country charts, Sheryl Crow&#x27;s people changed their minds. The Sheryl Crow version was released in January 2003. It would become Kid Rock&#x27;s first crossover hit charting at number 4 on the Hot 100, number 5 on the Top 40, number 2 on Adult Contemporary and number 17 on country radio. The single would be certified gold and spend 52 weeks on top the Country Singles Sales chart; it also peaked at number 1 on the US Singles Sales charts and number 2 on the Canadian Singles Sales chart. The song would be Sheryl Crow&#x27;s second most successful single after &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. The album climbed all the way back to number three. The song was nominated for CMA Vocal Event of The Year.

==Track listing==

A clean version is also available, removing most vulgarity, as well as the song &quot;WCSR&quot;. The clean version of the disc also features a picture of Kid Rock&#x27;s face on the disc, while the unedited version has an image of Rock&#x27;s hands with raised middle fingers (a reference to Rock&#x27;s previous album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; which featured just Rock&#x27;s right hand making the same gesture); both feature Kid Rock&#x27;s name. The edited version of &quot;Cocky&quot; also renames track 8 &quot;You Never Met a White Boy Quite Like Me&quot;.

<doc id="979007" wikidata="Q445096" url="?curid=979007" title="Jocelyn Pook">
<text>Jocelyn Pook (, rhyming with &quot;book&quot;) (born 14 February 1960) is an English composer who is known for her scores for many films, including &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;The Wife&quot;. Her principal instrument is the viola. Her scores and performances have been widely recorded, and have received multiple awards.

==Education==
Pook graduated in 1983 from London&#x27;s Guildhall School of Music and Drama where she studied the viola with David Takeno and piano with Carola Grindea. 
One of Pook`s first performance jobs was playing the violin in the musical composition for the Internationalist Theatre production of Miss Julie.

==Career==
Pook took part in the band ABC&#x27;s Lexicon Of Love World Tour and appeared in the Julian Temple/ABC movie &quot;Mantrap&quot;, continuing with a period of recording and performing with artists including Massive Attack, PJ Harvey, Peter Gabriel and as a member of The Communards for their three-year life. She also performed in this period as musician/actor with experimental theatre companies Impact Theatre Co-operative and Lumiere &amp; Son, as well as in several productions with The National Theatre.

As a composer her early works were mainly for dance and she wrote scores for DV8 Physical Theatre, O Vertigo Danse, Wayne MacGregor, Phoenix Dance Company, Shobana Jeyasingh Dance and more recently Akram Khan Company and English National Ballet. She worked on several DV8 Physical Theatre shows including Strange Fish which won a Prix Italia Award for Music.

Pook was a member of composer Jeremy Peyton Jones&#x27;s post systems music ensemble Regular Music, and recorded their albums for Rough Trade and Century XXI. She co-founded neoclassical chamber quartet Electra Strings alongside Australian violinist Sonia Slany. The Electra Quartet recorded, arranged and performed with many artists including Jools Holland, Mark Knopfler, The Stranglers, The Cranberries, This Mortal Coil, Nick Cave, Divine Comedy, Paul Weller, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Michael Nyman and Laurie Anderson, and in 1991 appeared in Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Edward II&quot;.

As a solo recording artist, Pook released several albums, including &quot;Deluge&quot; (Virgin Records 1997), &quot;Flood&quot; (Virgin Records 1999) and &quot;Untold Things&quot; (RealWorld Records 2001 - 2013). These also featured several singers she works regularly with, notably Melanie Pappenheim with whom she has collaborated on many projects.

Her career as a film composer took off when Stanley Kubrick heard her album &quot;Deluge&quot; and asked her to score his film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. The piece “Masked Ball”, which incorporated a fragment of an Orthodox Liturgy played backwards and lyrics sung (or chanted) in Romanian, underscored the masked ball sequence. Pook&#x27;s score for &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; received a Chicago Film Award and a Golden Globe nomination.

Pook&#x27;s score to Michael Radford&#x27;s film &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Al Pacino featured countertenor Andreas Scholl and was nominated for a Classical Brit Award. Other notable film scores include &quot;Brick Lane&quot; (Dir: Sarah Gavron), &quot;Heidi&quot; (Dir: Paul Marcus), &quot;Time Out&quot; (L’Emploi Du Temps, Dir: Laurent Cantet), Julio Medem&#x27;s &quot;Caótica Ana&quot; and &quot;Room in Rome&quot;, and a piece for the soundtrack to &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; directed by Martin Scorsese.
In 2018, she composed the soundtrack for &quot;The Wife&quot; starring Glenn Close, Jonathan Pryce and Christian Slater, which won the 2019 Music &amp; Sound Award for Best Original Composition in a Feature Film.

Pook was nominated for a BAFTA for her score for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; and, in April 2018, she won a BAFTA for her music for the 2017 TV film version of &quot;King Charles III&quot; (Dir: Rupert Gould). She wrote the score for Netflix documentary series &quot;The Staircase&quot; directed by Jean-Xavier Lestrade.

Pook wrote several concert, music theatre and opera pieces as well as touring with &quot;The Jocelyn Pook Ensemble&quot;.

In 2002 she was commissioned by The Proms to write a piece for The King&#x27;s Singers, &quot;Mobile&quot;, in collaboration with Andrew Motion. In 2003 she won a British Composer Award (currently named the Ivors Composer Awards) for her music-theatre piece &quot;Speaking in Tunes&quot;. She was commissioned to write a short opera, &quot;Ingerland&quot;, for ROH2 (the contemporary producing arm of London&#x27;s Royal Opera House) which was performed in the Royal Opera House&#x27;s Linbury Studio Theatre in June 2010. In December 2012 her symphonic song cycle &quot;Hearing Voices&quot;, exploring experiences of mental illness, featuring Melanie Pappenheim with Charles Hazlewood conducting the BBC Concert Orchestra was premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.

Pook won a second British Composer Award in 2012 for her soundtrack to Akram Khan&#x27;s dance production &quot;DESH&quot;. In June 2014 she composed music for English National Ballet&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival debut on the Pyramid Stage, performing Akram Khan&#x27;s First World War-themed &quot;Dust&quot;, broadcast on BBC2. Her most recent ballet for English National Ballet, &quot;M-Dao&quot; choreographed by Yabin Wang, premiered in 2016 at Sadler&#x27;s Wells.

She won an Olivier Award in 2008 for the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;St Joan&quot; (Dir: Marianne Elliot). Other theatre work includes the 2014 play &quot;King Charles III&quot; by Mike Bartlett which premiered at Almeida Theatre, transferred to West End&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre and then to Broadway, New York. Pook wrote the score for National Theatre of Scotland&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Adam&quot;, which premiered at Edinburgh International Festival in 2017 and featured a 120-strong, international digitally connected trans choir.

In 2019, Pook was commissioned by The Proms to write a new piece for Prom 49: The Lost Words. &quot;You Need To Listen To Us&quot; sets words from speeches by environmental activist Greta Thunberg to music. She also composed the soundtrack for &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;, a documentary about the controversial political career of Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, directed by Lauren Greenfield.

==Politics==
In November 2019, along with other public figures, Pook signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

<text>Portrait in Jazz is the fifth studio album by American jazz pianist Bill Evans as a leader, released in 1960. It is the first of only two studio albums to be recorded with his famous trio featuring bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian.

==Background==
Eight months after his successful collaboration with Miles Davis on the album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, Evans recorded &quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; with a new group, the first Bill Evans Trio, that helped change the direction of modern jazz.

Most notably, LaFaro&#x27;s bass is promoted from a mere accompanying instrument to one of almost equal status to the piano, although not to the extent that it would be on later albums such as &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot;. Evans said of LaFaro, &quot;I was astounded by his creativity ... There was so much music in him, he had a problem controlling it. ... He certainly stimulated me to other areas, and perhaps I helped him contain some of his enthusiasm. It was a wonderful thing and worth all the effort that we made later to suppress the ego and work for a common result.&quot;

Motian had recorded previously with Evans on his debut album, &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot;, as well as in groups led by Tony Scott, George Russell, and others. Evans biographer Keith Shadwick notes that Motian at this point tended to avoid standard bop formulas and would &quot;react instead to what he actually heard coming from the other two musicians,&quot; which &quot;added in no small degree to the unique quality of Evans&#x27;s first working trio.&quot;

==Repertoire==
The album includes seven jazz standards and two Evans compositions. The Disney song &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; had first been used as a vehicle for modern jazz by Dave Brubeck two years earlier on his album &quot;Dave Digs Disney&quot; and two years later would serve as the title track for an album by Miles Davis. It would remain a staple of Evans&#x27;s repertoire to the end of his career, with many later live recordings of it in circulation.

Evans&#x27;s composition &quot;Peri&#x27;s Scope&quot; was inspired by his then-girlfriend, Peri Cousins, who said the recording made her feel &quot;immortal.&quot; It has gone on to be covered several dozens times, including by important jazz artists such as Fred Hersch (1990) and Chick Corea (2011). The last track on the album is a new trio version of &quot;Blue in Green,&quot; a composition with disputed authorship that had first appeared as the third track on &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, where it was credited exclusively to Miles Davis. Here, it&#x27;s co-credited to Davis and Evans. The pianist said that &quot;it&#x27;s my tune, even though Miles is credited ... for reasons only he understands. One day at Miles&#x27;s apartment he wrote on some manuscript paper the symbols for G-minor and A-augmented. And he said, &#x27;What would you do with that?&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know, but I went home and wrote &#x27;Blue in Green.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; is one of Evans&#x27;s more up-tempo and swinging albums, the presence of several ballads notwithstanding.

==Reception==

Reviewing the album for AllMusic, critic Scott Yanow wrote, &quot;the influential interpretations were far from routine or predictable at the time. LaFaro and Motian were nearly equal partners with the pianist in the ensembles ... A gem.&quot; Danny Eccleston of &quot;Mojo&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Portrait In Jazz&quot;Evans&#x27; fifth record as a band leadergets you every which way. At its least great, it is merely brilliant ... But what makes Evans extra-extra-special is the way his playing drags you in and shares the vulnerability at its core. Oh, the humanity!&quot;

Evans biographer Peter Pettinger says that &quot;the plateau attained on &quot;Portrait&quot; was high indeed, its fresh vistas possessed of a new subtlety in the execution.&quot; He also singles out the performance of &quot;Spring Is Here&quot; by Richard Rodgers as &quot;a magnificent example of [Evans&#x27;s] lyrical touch.&quot; Shadwick refers to the album as establishing &quot;the blueprint for every subsequent working trio that Evans would run.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; was released on compact disc in 1987 by Riverside/Original Jazz Classics with four alternative takes as bonus tracks. In 2008, a 24-bit remastered edition was released by Riverside as part of its &quot;Keepnews Collection.&quot;

<text>Otpor (, , stylized as Otpor!) was a political organization in Serbia (then part of FR Yugoslavia) from 1998 until 2004.

In its initial period from 1998 to 2000, Otpor began as a civic protest group, eventually turning into a movement, which adopted the &quot;Narodni pokret&quot; (the People&#x27;s Movement) title, against the policies of the Serbian authorities under the influence of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. Following Milošević&#x27;s overthrow in October 2000, Otpor became a political watchdog organization monitoring the activities of the post-Milošević period of the DOS coalition. Finally, during fall 2003, Otpor briefly became a political party which, due to its failure to pass the 5% threshold needed to get any seats in the Serbian parliament, soon merged with another party.

Founded and best known as an organization employing nonviolent struggle as a course of action against the Milošević-controlled Serbian authorities, Otpor grew into a civic youth movement whose activity culminated on 5 October 2000 with Milošević&#x27;s overthrow. In the course of a two-year nonviolent struggle against Milošević, Otpor spread across Serbia, attracting in its heyday more than 70,000 supporters who were credited for their role in the 5 October overthrow.

After the overthrow, Otpor launched campaigns to hold the new government accountable, pressing for democratic reforms and fighting corruption, as well as insisting on cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTY) at the Hague.

Soon after the 2003 elections, Otpor merged into the Democratic Party (DS).

==Initial activity==

Otpor was formed in Belgrade on 10 October 1998 in response to a controversial piece of legislation in Serbia – the university law – introduced earlier that year by the Serbian government under Prime Minister Mirko Marjanović. Also, days before Otpor got announced, the government introduced a decree (uredba) outlining special measures in the wake of the ongoing NATO bombing threat. Citing the decree, on 14 October 1998, the government&#x27;s Ministry of Information headed by Aleksandar Vučić banned the publishing of &quot;Dnevni telegraf&quot;, &quot;Danas&quot;, and &quot;Naša borba&quot;, three Belgrade dailies which were critical of the government to varying degrees.

The newly formed group named Otpor mostly consisted of the Demokratska omladina (Democratic Party&#x27;s youth wing) members, activists of the various NGOs that operated in Serbia, and students from the two public universities in Belgrade – University of Belgrade and University of Arts. It quickly grew from a small group into a network of similarly politically minded young people, many of whom were already veterans of anti-Milošević demonstrations such as the 1996-97 protests and the 9 March 1991 protest. With the political opposition in Serbia in disarray, Otpor decided to build a broad political movement rather than a traditional NGO or political party. Frustrated with opposition leaders protecting their narrow personal and party interests, which often degenerated into infighting, the group also decided that &quot;it would have no leaders&quot;.

Early on, Otpor defined its objectives and methods, including an account of what it saw as the main problems of the country, in the &quot;Declaration of the Future of Serbia.&quot; The declaration was signed and supported by all prominent student organizations in Serbia. An advisory body was set up and its members became the main promoters of the declaration.

Initially, Otpor&#x27;s activities were limited to the University of Belgrade. In an effort to gather new nonpartisan energy, not to mention making it harder for state media to discredit and smear them as just another opposition political group, Otpor avoided publicizing its ties to the Democratic Party (DS) even though the two organizations held similar political goals and shared many of the same members. Early on they agreed the organization&#x27;s symbol to be the clenched fist. Young designer Nenad &quot;Duda&quot; Petrović created the logo.

===Four students get arrested for stenciling Otpor logo===
The authorities&#x27; immediate reaction to the appearance of Otpor was extremely heavy-handed, even before the movement held any public gatherings. In the early morning hours of Wednesday, 4 November 1998, four students – 22-year-old Teodora Tabački (enrolled at the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy), Marina Glišić (22, Faculty of Philosophy), Dragana Milinković (22, Faculty of Philology), and Nikola Vasiljević (19, University of Arts&#x27; FDU) – were arrested for stencil spraying the clenched fist symbol on the UofB&#x27;s Faculty of Mathematics building facade. Later that same day, after reportedly being intimidated into signing a pre-typed, joint statement of guilt, the four students were taken before a misdemeanor judge who handed them a sentence of 10 days in prison. In his explanation of the sentence, judge Željko Muniža cited that &quot;with their brazen and reckless behaviour, the four students have endangered the citizens&#x27; calm and disturbed the public order.&quot; On 5 November, the students&#x27; legal representatives – Nikola Barović, Branko Pavlović, and Dušan Stojković – appealed the respective sentences citing &quot;improper use of both the misdemeanor process and the misdemeanor law as well as the scandalous subsequent sanction.&quot; One day later, the misdemeanor council rejected the appeal as baseless.

The case generated some public reaction with the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Electrical Engineering professor and Otpor member Srbijanka Turajlić calling the sentences &quot;inappropriate&quot; and further scolding the University of Belgrade rector Jagoš Purić as well as University of Arts rector Radmila Bakočević for &quot;not publicly reacting to their own students being rounded-up on the street and hauled off to jail&quot;.

===&quot;Dnevni telegraf&quot; gets fined for publishing an Otpor ad===
The organization gained further prominence when the &quot;Dnevni telegraf&quot; (daily tabloid owned and edited by Slavko Ćuruvija) 7 November issue appeared on newsstands with Otpor&#x27;s ad featuring the clenched fist symbol on the front page. The paper had previously been banned for &quot;spreading defeatism by running subversive headlines&quot;, a punishment meted out under the controversial new government decree. And though the ban was lifted within a week as the decree was put out of effect only to be replaced by the new information law, &quot;Dnevni telegraf&quot;&#x27;s publishing hiatus continued past the ban being lifted and the 7 November issue was its return to the newsstands. Seeing the Otpor ad on the front page, the authorities quickly reacted again, taking Ćuruvija and his collaborators to court within days via a trumped up private citizen&#x27;s complaint and handing them another draconian fine under the information law, this time prompting the newspaper&#x27;s relocation to Podgorica.

===Veran Matić wears Otpor t-shirt during MTV Europe Awards live broadcast===
Several days later, on Thursday, 12 November, another instance of Otpor&#x27;s public exposure occurred – this time at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Assago near Milan where Radio B92 was the recipient of the Free Your Mind award. Accepting the award presented by Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, and Mike Mills of R.E.M. during live broadcast, B92 head Veran Matić came out on stage in an Otpor T-shirt with inscription &quot;Живи Отпор!&quot; (Live the Resistance) above the clenched fist logo. In his acceptance speech, delivered in Serbian, Matić explicitly mentioned the four students that were arrested and sentenced the previous week.

The awards ceremony was carried live in Serbia on TV Košava, a station owned at the time by Milošević&#x27;s daughter Marija. However, when it came time for the Free Your Mind award to be handed out in the live broadcast, only the initial intro by R.E.M. and part of the accompanying pre-taped video piece about Radio B92 was shown before abruptly cutting to an extended block of commercials.

Otpor&#x27;s first significant gathering took place on Saturday, 14 November at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering – over a thousand students marched across town to the Faculty of Philology where a number of students were under lockdown inside the building as the authorities wanted to prevent them from joining the protest. Otpor leader Srđa Popović (also a member of the Democratic Party) was arrested that day and then released on intervention from Amnesty International after being detained for 8 hours. By late November, Otpor ideas reached Novi Sad, Serbia&#x27;s second city, with the first graffiti appearing on buildings in the city.

During the NATO air-strikes against FR Yugoslavia in 1999 regarding the Kosovo War, Otpor ceased its activities. In the aftermath of NATO bombing, the organization began a political campaign aimed directly against the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. This resulted in nationwide police repression against Otpor activists, during which nearly 2,000 were arrested, some beaten.

===Organization grows into a movement===
Otpor next managed to bring opposition parties together and mobilize the population of Serbia against Milošević. It stressed the importance of mobilizing the population to vote, but also promoted &quot;individual resistance&quot; (i.e. nonviolent methods of civic disobedience in order to counter possible electoral fraud). This strategy was slowly embraced by the opposition parties in the months to come.

The strategy was based on two assumptions:
* That the opposition had to be united around one presidential candidate in order to get more votes than Milošević; and
* That Milošević would never accept defeat in the elections (and he would falsify ballots and even use force to defend his power).

By fall 1999 and early 2000, the Serbian opposition political parties, most notably the Democratic Party and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), realized the potency of Otpor&#x27;s methods and the resonance of its message with the youth. Thus began the battle for control of Otpor between DS and SPO. Since both parties already had a significant number of their youth wing members within Otpor, this trend continued on a large scale with both DS and SPO (and other opposition parties as well) instructing their local chapters throughout Serbia to recruit party youth members en masse into Otpor. As a result, Otpor&#x27;s membership swelled into tens of thousands.

Otpor&#x27;s unified message and diverse membership proved much more attractive to young activists than the deeply divided opposition parties of the time. Although they had found common ground in Otpor, the separate opposition parties were still reluctant to cooperate among themselves. Otpor&#x27;s major challenge was to bring these divided groups together in preparation for the 2000 election campaign. Instead of using old methods of &quot;bringing everyone to the table and then…trying to come up with a common strategy and goal&quot;, the original core group of Otpor founders had gathered to first find a single goal that everyone could agree upon: removing Milošević.

During the presidential campaign of September 2000, Otpor launched its &quot;Gotov je&quot; (He&#x27;s Finished!) and the &quot;Vreme Je!&quot; (It&#x27;s Time!) campaigns, which galvanized national discontent with Milošević and eventually resulted in his defeat. Some students who led Otpor used Serbian translations of Gene Sharp&#x27;s writings on nonviolent action as a theoretical basis for their campaigns.

Otpor became one of the defining symbols of the anti-Milošević struggle and his subsequent overthrow. By aiming their activities at the pool of youth abstainers and other disillusioned voters, Otpor contributed to one of the biggest turnouts ever for the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections with more than 4,77 million votes (72% of the total electorate).

Persuading a large number of the traditional electorate to abandon Milošević was another one of the areas where Otpor played a key role. Milošević had in the past succeeded in persuading the public that his political opponents were traitors working for foreign interests, but in the case of Otpor, the tactic largely backfired, as the beatings and imprisonments of their members during the summer of 2000 only further cemented the decision to vote against the government in many voters&#x27; minds.

==Strategy and tactics==

===Principles of the movement===
Otpor operated on the basis of three principles: unity, planning, and nonviolent discipline.

It used the following ten strategies to achieve success:
# Take an offensive approach
# Understand the concept of &quot;power in numbers&quot;
# Develop a superior communication strategy
# Create the perception of a successful movement
# Invest in the skills and knowledge of activists
# Cultivate external support
# Induce security force defections
# Resist oppression 
## By means of decentralized leadership, education, using humor to maintain morale, and supporting members who had been arrested
# Use elections to trigger change
# Enable peaceful transition of power

===Tactics===

====Protest and persuasion====
* Public theater and street acts to mock Milošević
* Extensive branding by hanging posters and stickers in widely trafficked areas
* Rallies, marches, and demonstration
* Electoral politics – campaigning &amp; coalition-building
* Concerts and cultural celebrations
* Distribution of anti-Milošević materials
* Strategic use of internet, fax, and email to organize and distribute information and volunteers 
* Covert and public communication important community leaders to cultivate allies
* Public statements, press releases, petitions, and speeches
* Distribution of training manuals, frequent workshops for activists

====Noncooperation====
* Boycotts and strikes by students, artists, actors, and business owners
* General strikes
* Defection of both security forces and members of the media
* Organization that occurred outside the electoral system
* Election monitors and well-organized election results reporting system

====Nonviolent intervention====
* Blockades of highways in order to debilitate the economy and demonstrate power
* Occupation of key public buildings, occasional nonviolent invasions of said buildings
* Bulldozers moving aside police barricades

===Examples of specific campaigns===

Humor was the basis of Otpor&#x27;s campaigns; it used irony to provoke the government and motivate Serbians to join the movement. The following are specific campaigns designed by Otpor in 1998-2000

A Dinar for Change: Otpor activists painted Milošević&#x27;s face on a barrel and set up in front of the Belgrade National Theater, asking passersby to pay one Yugoslav dinar to hit the portrait. The activists went to the sidelines and watched as the barrel attracted more and more attention. Police eventually confiscated the barrel.

Happy Birthday Milošević: Activists in Niš created this event to &quot;celebrate&quot; Milošević&#x27;s party with a cake, a card, gifts, and wishes. More than 2,000 citizens had the opportunity to sign the card, and gifts such as handcuffs, a one-way ticket to the Hague, and a prison uniform were received on his behalf.

The Fist is the Salute: A poster campaign depicting many well-known Serbians raising their fists in opposition to Milošević. Over 50,000 copies were distributed. The campaign ended on New Year&#x27;s with a Santa Claus fist poster.

Resistance, Because I Love Serbia: The most widespread poster campaign with a circulation of 150,000.

This is THE Year: 3,000 people gathered in downtown Belgrade for a New Year&#x27;s party in January 2000. After a night of celebration, Otpor interrupted the jubilation with pictures of the horrors of the past ten years, telling Serbian they had nothing to celebrate. The people were asked to go home peacefully and to think about how they were going to change their situation.

It&#x27;s spreading: In Spring 2000, Otpor undertook efforts to spread the movement to rural areas and the nonacademic population.

It&#x27;s time!: A clock showing five minutes to twelve with the slogan &quot;vreme je!&quot; was used to convince all audiences that they must quickly act.

He&#x27;s finished!: Otpor&#x27;s most well-known campaign. Close to the elections, volunteers put up over 1,500,000 &quot;He&#x27;s finished!&quot; (Gotov je! / Готов је!) stickers on existing posters of Milošević and all over cities.

Use it!: Campaign for raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and approaching general elections in December. Posters, pamphlets, and condom packages featured stylized image of human brain.

Stamp it!: Campaign employed by Otpor after the fall of Milošević. The campaign reminded Serbians that they must follow through by defeating Milošević in the December general elections.

==Post-Milošević==
In the immediate months following 5th October Overthrow, Otpor members were suddenly the widely praised heroes throughout FR Yugoslavia as well as in the eyes of Western governments. From the wide range of local celebrities and public figures seeking positive attention by wearing Otpor T-shirts, to Partizan basketball club painting the Otpor logo in the center circle for their FIBA Suproleague game, the clenched fist was omnipresent. This widespread popularity inspired even some individuals tied to the former government to become involved with the DOS authorities by praising Otpor and its activities.

The pop-culture component of Otpor&#x27;s activities became especially pronounced in this period. On 16 November, little over a month after the overthrow, Otpor received the Free Your Mind award at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards. Activists Milja Jovanović and Branko Ilić were on hand in Stockholm to accept the award presented to them by French actor Jean Reno. Back home a couple of days later, FR Yugoslavia&#x27;s foreign minister Goran Svilanović held a reception for Otpor&#x27;s delegation consisting of Milja Jovanović, Ivan Andrić, and Nenad Konstantinović in order to congratulate them on the MTV award. Then, in early December, Serbian singer-songwriter Đorđe Balašević held a concert in Belgrade&#x27;s National Theater specifically for and in praise of Otpor members, which was televised nationally on RTS2. The movement even turned to concert promotion itself, organizing several Laibach gigs in Belgrade.

In the midst of all the praise and adulation, the movement promised to keep on. Otpor initially attempted to establish itself in a &quot;watch dog&quot; role after the revolution by launching campaigns holding the new government accountable, pressing for democratic reforms, and fighting corruption. It started weeks after the revolution with &quot;Samo vas gledamo&quot; (We&#x27;re Watching You) campaign, sending the message of accountability to new authorities. In parallel, by November 2000, with the upcoming December 2000 parliamentary elections, launched two campaigns named &quot;Overi&quot; (Verify It) and &quot;Upotrebi ga&quot; (Use It). Though some already questioned the movement&#x27;s , the idea behind both was to encourage the electorate to &quot;verify&quot; the 5 October revolution by voting against the parties that were part of the government – the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) – at the upcoming constituent republic-level parliamentary election.

In 2001, the corruption monitoring becoming the new focus with several new anti-corruption campaigns started (&quot;Bez anestezije&quot;, etc.), but it was clear that Otpor experienced problems staying relevant on the transformed political scene of Serbia and FR Yugoslavia.

===Revelation of U.S. involvement===
By late November 2000, information started appearing about substantial outside assistance Otpor received leading up to the revolution. Otpor was a recipient of substantial funds from U.S. government-affiliated organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), and US Agency for International Development (USAID).

Contacting various officials from the U.S. based organizations, in his &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; piece, journalist Roger Cohen sought to shed some light on the extent of American logistical and financial assistance received by Otpor. Paul B. McCarthy from the Washington-based NED stated that Otpor received the majority of US$3 million spent by NED in Serbia from September 1998 until October 2000. At the same time, McCarthy himself held a series of meetings with Otpor&#x27;s leaders in Podgorica, as well as Szeged and Budapest.

Just how much of the US resources appropriated in the year 2000 by USAID, for democracy and governance, which included support to groups that worked to bring an end to the Milošević era through peaceful, democratic means, went to Otpor is not clear. However, what &quot;is&quot; clear is that the Democratic Opposition of Serbia—a broad alliance of those seeking Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s downfall, among them the Democratic Party (Serbia) Otpor would later merge with—received in excess of $30 million to &quot;purchase cell phones and computers for DOS&#x27;s leadership and to recruit and train an army of 20,000 election monitors&quot; as well as to supplement them with &quot;a sophisticated marketing campaign with posters, badges and T-shirts.&quot; Donald L. Pressley, the assistant administrator at USAID said that several hundred thousand dollars were given to Otpor directly for similar purposes.

===Transformation into a political party===
The official announcement of Otpor&#x27;s transformation into a political party was made on 19 November 2003, days after the parliamentary elections had been set for 23 December. The party didn&#x27;t name an official leader. However, cousins Slobodan Homen and Nenad Konstantinović played key roles. Asked about the new party&#x27;s finances in November 2003, Konstantinović said it was funded by the Serbian companies.

Otpor started its election campaign on Saturday, 29 November 2003 by submitting its 250-person candidate list. In addition to former Otpor activists such as Slobodan Homen, Nenad Konstantinović, Ivan Marović, Predrag Lečić, Stanko Lazendić, and Srđan Milivojević, the candidate list featured established professionals in other arenas such as professor and anti-corruption campaigner Čedomir Čupić, political analyst Dušan Janjić, psychologist Žarko Trebješanin, lawyer Boža Pelević, and former Serbian Supreme Court vice-president Zoran Ivošević. The candidate list named &quot;Otpor—Freedom, Solidarity and Justice&quot; led by Čupić fared poorly, with only 62,116 votes (1.6% of total vote) in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election, which left it out of the parliament (the census required a minimum of 5%).

By spring 2004, in the aftermath of the election, the organization faced more turmoil when Branimir Nikolić, a prominent activist from Otpor&#x27;s Subotica chapter, publicly accused the party central, namely Homen and Konstantinović, of embezzlement. Soon after, another member of Otpor, Zoran Matović, joined Nikolić&#x27;s accusations, claiming that out of the €2.1 million that came into the organization during 2001 and 2002, more than half went missing. Responding to the accusations in both instances, Homen announced his intention to sue both Nikolić and Matović.

===End===
In early September 2004, amid internal turmoil, the remnants of Otpor merged into the Democratic Party led by Boris Tadić.

The observer reaction in Serbia to the dissolution of Otpor was mixed. Some talked of Otpor&#x27;s &quot;ideologically heterogeneous membership that in addition to progressives also contained those well infected with Milošević&#x27;s war propaganda&quot;, seeing the organization&#x27;s eventual demise in the post-Milošević period as the victory of the latter over the former, while others believed Otpor&#x27;s failure in the political arena was caused by its inability to disassociate itself from foreign aid.

===Commemorative reunions and usage of Otpor symbols===
In the years since its dissolution, Otpor&#x27;s symbols and imagery occasionally reappeared in Serbian political life. Some of the former Otpor activists also organized a few official commemorative gatherings.

In April 2008, during the election campaign ahead of the parliamentary election, the clenched fist was stenciled on several walls in Novi Sad. This led to an announcement of Otpor&#x27;s reactivation by its former activist Nenad Šeguljev, however nothing ever came of it.

Later that year on 13 November, Serbian president Boris Tadić held a reception to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Otpor&#x27;s founding. Former activists Srđa Popović, Slobodan Đinović, Slobodan Homen, Nenad Konstantinović, Dejan Ranđić, Ivan Andrić, Andreja Stamenković, Milja Jovanović, Branko Ilić, Srđan Milivojević, Jovan Ratković, Predrag Lečić, Vlada Pavlov, Stanko Lazendić, Miloš Gagić, and Siniša Šikman were on hand at the presidential palace at Andrićev Venac, giving Tadić an old Otpor poster. Tadić underscored Otpor&#x27;s &quot;important role in the democratization of Serbia&quot;. The next day, in Stari dvor, the exhibition of Otpor&#x27;s materials was opened with Belgrade mayor Dragan Đilas saluting the former movement for &quot;the courage shown in the fight for democratic changes and thus enabling others to live in a normal country&quot;.

In July 2011, posters with clenched fist and a message &quot;Pruži Otpor svakoj lošoj vlasti&quot; (Resist all bad authorities) appeared all over the city of Bor, protesting the local authorities&#x27; decision to build a roundabout.

In October 2011, the Democratic Party (DS) official web site (ds.org.rs) was taken down by unknown hackers who left the Otpor logo on the site.

==Otpor leaders after Otpor==
Though its members often proudly talked of the movement&#x27;s &quot;horizontal command hierarchy&quot; and its lack of established leadership structure, Otpor still exhibited a top-down organizational model with several members from its Belgrade central office clearly asserting themselves as the main decision makers. Their involvement in Otpor served as a springboard to Serbian political, business, and NGO careers.

===Srđa Popović and Ivan Marović===
In terms of media exposure, Srđa Popović is Otpor&#x27;s best known member. He features prominently in Western television news items and documentaries about the movement such as the BAFTA-winning feature documentary &quot;How to Start a Revolution&quot; and PBS&#x27; &quot;Bringing Down A Dictator&quot; as well as numerous international print and Internet media pieces about the direct and indirect influence of former Otpor members on various post-2000 revolutions around the globe.

Shortly after 5 October 2000 revolution, he left Otpor to pursue a political career in Serbia, becoming a Democratic Party (DS) MP in the Serbian assembly as well as an environmental adviser to prime minister Zoran Đinđić. In essence, it was 27-year-old Popović&#x27;s return to the DS since he was active in the party&#x27;s youth wing since the early 1990s.

Simultaneous to his political engagement, Popović, together with former colleagues from Otpor Predrag Lečić and Andreja Stamenković, founded the environmental non-governmental organization Green Fist. Conceptualized as an &quot;ecological movement&quot;, it attempted to transfer some of Otpor&#x27;s mass appeal into environmental issues by using similar imagery, but soon folded.

In 2003, Popović, with another prominent former Otpor member Slobodan Đinović, co-founded Centre for Applied Non Violent Actions and Strategies, (CANVAS), an organization focused on the use of nonviolent conflict to promote human rights and democracy, and eventually quit actively participating in Serbian politics. Instead, he started to cooperate with Stratfor, which paid for Popović lectures about CANVAS fomenting color revolutions also in Iran, Venezuela and Egypt.

In 2006, Popović and two of his former Otpor colleagues, now CANVAS members – Slobodan Đinović and Andrej Milivojević – authored a book called &quot;Nonviolent Struggle: 50 Crucial Points&quot;, a how-to guide to nonviolent struggle, which can be downloaded for free in six languages from their website. The book was financed with a grant from the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), an organization founded and funded by the U.S. Congress. The book has been downloaded some 20,000 times in the Middle East, mostly by Iranians. Due to their involvement in regime changes all around the globe, CANVAS has been labeled &quot;Academy of Revolution&quot; while Popović and others involved in the organization have been referred to by various media outlets as &quot;professors of revolution&quot;, &quot;revolution consultants&quot;, &quot;professional revolutionaries&quot;, and &quot;revolution exporters&quot;.

In 2007, Popović became adviser to Serbian deputy prime minister Božidar Đelić.

Popović additionally heads the Ecotopia fund, the non-profit organization dealing with the environmental issues, financially backed by various Serbian governmental institutions as well as the private sector. In 2009, the fund organized a wide environmental campaign featuring well-known Serbian actors and media personalities with television spots and newspaper ads. On top of that Popović is a board member of International Communications Partners, a media and PR consulting company.

Today, in addition to their revolution-consulting and training activities through CANVAS that according to one report take up a third of their year, Popović is active on the speaking engagement circuit throughout various Western countries where they&#x27;re frequently hired by universities, institutes, and think-tanks to give lectures and hold workshops on strategy and organization of nonviolent struggle. Since 2008. Popović and Đinović have also launched CANVAS-related graduate program in cooperation with University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Political Science.

From 2011 to 2012, Popovic was a visiting scholar at Columbia University&#x27;s Harriman Institute.

In November 2011, &quot;Foreign Policy Magazine&quot; listed Srdja Popovic as one of the &quot;Top 100 Global Thinkers&quot; of 2011 for inspiring the Arab Spring protesters directly and indirectly and educating activists about nonviolent social change in the Middle East.

In February 2012, Srdja Popovic was named to &quot;The Smart List 2012&quot; by &quot;Wired UK&quot; magazine as one of 50 people who will change the world.

Popovic appeared in the 2011 BAFTA award-winning film, &quot;How to Start a Revolution&quot;.

In addition to Popović, Ivan Marović is another Otpor activist with significant media presence, both before and after Milošević fell. During the movement&#x27;s activist days leading up to the overthrow, his appearances in the anti-government Serbian media were in the capacity of one of the movement&#x27;s spokespeople.

He stayed at Otpor even after the transformation into the political party and was its MP candidate at the December 2003 parliamentary election. He also became active on the speaking engagement circuit, mostly in the United States, where like Popović he gives lectures on his experiences from Otpor days. Additionally, Marović is one of the designers behind &quot;A Force More Powerful&quot; and &quot;People Power: The Game of Civil Resistance&quot;, video games that promote nonviolent struggle as a political tool. During the mid-2000s (decade) he moved to the United States where in 2007 he earned his master&#x27;s degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. In the late 2000s (decade) he returned to Serbia. Since the mid-2000s (decade), he has maintained a blog on B92.net.

===Slobodan &quot;Cole&quot; Homen and Nenad &quot;Neca&quot; Konstantinović===
Unlike Popović and Marović, Slobodan Homen mostly kept behind the scenes while at Otpor. Born to affluent parents – prominent Belgrade lawyers Borivoje Homen and Dušanka Subotić – young Slobodan was raised in privileged circumstances. During his days studying law, before becoming one of Otpor&#x27;s founding members, he was the president of the University of Belgrade&#x27;s student parliament. Described by sources quoted in the Serbian media as Otpor&#x27;s &quot;alpha and omega&quot; during the movement&#x27;s heyday in the spring and summer of 2000, Homen and his cousin Nenad Konstantinović handled everything from money to transportation. Homen was also the main point of contact for the foreign-based organizations that donated significant funds to Otpor. Otpor&#x27;s headquarters was owned by Homen&#x27;s family. Some accused Homen of an obvious conflict of interest in this situation after allegations appeared that his family actually rented out the space to Otpor, which was paying for it with the money from the incoming donations.

After Milošević&#x27;s overthrow, Homen and Konstantinović were of the opinion that Otpor should evolve into a political party, which put them at odds with some of the movement&#x27;s other activists. The two eventually got their way in 2003, but did poorly at the parliamentary elections later that year. Simultaneously, Homen and his family were involved in various high-profile real-estate business ventures in the city of Belgrade, some of which raised controversy.

After Otpor merged into the Democratic Party, Homen set about building a political career there. In 2008, he became state secretary in the Serbian Ministry of Justice working under cabinet minister Snežana Malović, within the government of prime minister Mirko Cvetković. Following the 10 October 2010 mass rioting by the right-wing groups in protest of the Belgrade gay pride parade, standing in front of the Democratic Party headquarters that were attacked by the rioters, Homen went on state-television airwaves, delivering a threatening message to the &quot;hooligans&quot;. Speaking to a reporter, Homen said: &quot;I can guarantee you that they&#x27;ll remember this day because the state&#x27;s response to this will be chilling&quot;. In March 2011, Homen was named the Serbian government&#x27;s PR coordinator.

Konstantinović, another Otpor founding member, also went on to a notable career within the Democratic Party (DS). He&#x27;s the president of the Serbian parliamentary administrative board and was a high-ranking official of the ruling coalition that held power in Serbia from 2008 until 2012.

===Slobodan Đinović===
During his Otpor days, Slobodan Đinović, leader of the student organization at the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, founded an NGO called the Center for Political Analysis (CPA). The idea behind the venture was to set up an organization ready to become an alternative source for disseminating information in case Milošević shut down all the non-governmental media outlets.

Soon after Milošević fell, Đinović founded Media Works, the first Wi-Fi provider in Serbia. Center for Political Analysis eventually folded as Đinović decided to focus more on his budding telecommunications business. In parallel, he was active with CANVAS.

In early 2010, Media Works merged with wired Internet providers Neobee.net and SezamPro to form Orion Telekom, of which Đinović is the CEO. Utilizing a government-issued licence for providing fixed wireless services that Media Works won in 2009, Orion began offering fixed telephony services throughout Serbia using the CDMA method of access in June 2010.

In the documentary film &quot;The Revolution Business&quot; produced by Austrian TV ORF and distributed by Journeyman Pictures, Srdja Popović claimed Đinović is the main financial backer of CANVAS. Đinović is also the managing board member of the state-owned Ada Ciganlija company, which manages the public grounds of the eponymous river island.

===Ivan Andrić and Dejan Ranđić===
The creative presence behind many of Otpor&#x27;s visuals and media campaigns was Ivan Andrić. After the revolution, he left the movement for politics, joining the Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS) and becoming managing board member of the state-owned Belgrade Youth Center. He later joined the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), becoming its MP. Furthermore, in 2002, with close friend from Otpor days and Youth Center managing board colleague Dejan Ranđić (who would also later go on to become high-ranking LDP official), Andrić founded the marketing agency Gistro Advertising that has in the years since done prominent product launches and ad campaigns for various clients in Serbia such as government ministries, political parties (including the transformed Otpor), local municipalities, and state-owned enterprises.

==Legacy==
In addition to contributing to Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s overthrow, Otpor has become the
model for similar youth movements around Eastern Europe. MTV granted Otpor the Free Your Mind award in 2000. There were several award-winning documentaries made about the movement, most notably &quot;Making of The Revolution&quot; by Eric Van Den Broek and Katarina Rejger (launched at the Amnesty International Film Festival in 2001) and &quot;Bringing Down A Dictator&quot; by Steve York, which won a Peabody Award in 2002, narrated by Martin Sheen. It has reportedly been seen by over 23 million people around the world.

Otpor members were instrumental in inspiring and providing hands-on training to several other civic youth organizations in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, including Kmara in the Republic of Georgia (itself partly responsible for the downfall of Eduard Shevardnadze), PORA (black) (which was part of the Orange Revolution) and Vidsich (opposing the president Viktor Yanukovych) in Ukraine, Zubr in Belarus (opposing the president Alexander Lukashenko), MJAFT! in Albania, Oborona in Russia (opposing the president Vladimir Putin), KelKel in Kyrgyzstan (active in the revolution that brought down the president Askar Akayev), Bolga in Uzbekistan (opposing Islam Karimov) and Nabad-al-Horriye in Lebanon. A similar group of students was present in Venezuela against Hugo Chávez. In 2008, an April 6 Youth Movement was founded in Egypt, which facilitated and joined the 2011 Egyptian protests, and took advice from Otpor in the process.

In 2002, some former Otpor members, most notably Slobodan Đinović and Srđa Popović, founded the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). This NGO disseminated the lessons learned from their successful nonviolent struggle through scores of trainings and workshops for pro-democracy activists and others around the world, including in Egypt, Palestine, Western Sahara, West Papua, Eritrea, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Tonga, Burma and Zimbabwe as well as labor, anti-war, and immigration rights activists in the United States.

In their search for lessons learned from other activist movements, the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt consulted with Otpor members and adopted some of their strategies in their rallying for the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

In interviews, the leaders and consultants of Otpor have described their involvement in the planning, coordination and implementation of the 2011 &quot;Arab spring&quot; revolutions.

<doc id="979014" wikidata="Q2328768" url="?curid=979014" title="Kid Rock (album)">
<text>Kid Rock is the sixth studio album by American musician Kid Rock, his fourth Atlantic Records album. It was released in 2003 and is his final release on Lava Records. It was critically acclaimed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which named it one of the 50 Greatest Albums of 2003. &quot;Black Bob&quot; and &quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; were recorded for his 1996 album &quot;Early Mornin&#x27; Stoned Pimp&quot; in 1995, but were left off the album. &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;, &quot;Cold and Empty&quot;, &quot;Intro&quot;, &quot;Hillbilly Stomp&quot; and &quot;Run Off to LA&quot; were recorded for the demo sessions for 2001&#x27;s &quot;Cocky&quot;, but did not make the cut as well. &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; originally had Sheryl Crow on the song. Country singer Kenny Chesney co-wrote &quot;Cold and Empty&quot;.

The cover image was later reused for Rock&#x27;s 2018 compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits: You Never Saw Coming&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==

The album&#x27;s lead single was a cover of Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;. It was released October 2, 2003, to radio and peaked at number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song was performed on The Tonight Show, Big In 03 Awards and the American Music Awards for its promotional push. The promotional push was capped off by the VH-1 Special A Kid Rock Christmas. He would then go on the Rock N Roll Pain Train Tour. In January 2004 he released the dark southern metal song &quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; to rock stations and the country love ballad &quot;Cold and Empty&quot; to AC and Pop stations. &quot;Jackson&quot; peaked at number 14 on the Mainstream Rock chart while &quot;Cold and Empty&quot; peaked at number 20 on the AC chart. The song failed to chart on either the Top 40 or Hot 100. &quot;Cold And Empty&quot; was used on the WB&#x27;s Smallville. In July 2004 he followed the same route releasing dual singles again, releasing the acoustic ballad &quot;I Am&quot; to rock radio and the country ballad &quot;Single Father&quot;, a cover of David Allan Coe, to country radio. &quot;I Am&quot; peaked at number 28 on the Mainstream Rock chart and was performed on the Tonight Show and Last Call. &quot;Single Father&quot; would become Kid Rock&#x27;s second charting country song, after &quot;Picture&quot;. It would peak at number 50. Kid Rock was criticized at Super Bowl 38 for wearing the American flag as a poncho. The incident was overshadowed by Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and &quot;Nipplegate&quot;.

<text>Peter Munk (November 8, 1927 – March 28, 2018) was a Hungarian-Canadian businessman, investor, founder and philanthropist. He was the founder and chief executive officer of a number of high-profile business ventures, including the hi-fi electronics company Clairtone, real estate company Trizec Properties, and Barrick Gold, formerly the world&#x27;s largest gold-mining corporation.

Munk is known for his philanthropy, as a donor to Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre at the Toronto General Hospital. He is also well known for supporting the Munk Debates.

==Early years and family==

Munk was born in Budapest, into a prosperous Hungarian-Jewish family, the son of Katharina Adler Munk and Lajos &quot;Louis&quot; Munk (1898–1977). His grandfather, Gábor &quot;Gabriel&quot; Munk, had descended from a family of rabbis, was a brother of the noted linguist and ethnologist Bernát Munkácsi (né Munk), and uncle of the Hungarian jurist and writer Ernő Munkácsi. Gábor became wealthy via Austro-Hungarian distribution rights for the popular Viennese chocolate brand, Manner, invested in real estate, then, during World War II, used what remained of his fortune to buy safe passage out of Hungary to neutral Switzerland for members of his immediate family, including his grandson Peter. 

Hungary was occupied by Nazi Germany in March 1944, when Munk was aged 16; along with 14 members of his family, he escaped on the Kastner train, which carried 1,684 Jews to safety in Switzerland. The journey had been arranged by Rudolf Kastner of the Zionist Aid and Rescue Committee, as a result of secret negotiations with Adolf Eichmann—the high-ranking Nazi had allowed some Jews to leave in exchange for money, gold, and diamonds, part of a series of so-called &quot;blood for goods&quot; deals. Munk&#x27;s mother, who divorced his father when he was four, was deported from Budapest to Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944. She survived, but later died by suicide.

Munk arrived in Canada in 1948, via Switzerland, initially on a student visa, then graduated from the University of Toronto, in 1952, with a degree in electrical engineering. Decades later, he praised Canada: &quot;I arrived in this place not speaking the language, not knowing a dog... This is a country that does not ask about your origins; it only concerns itself with your destiny.&quot;

==Career==
===Clairtone===
In 1958, with $2,800 from his father-in-law, Webber Pharmaceuticals (now Webber Naturals) founder William Jay Gutterson, he co-founded Clairtone with Scandinavian furniture importer David Gilmour. Clairtone manufactured high-end console stereos, and later televisions, which were recognizable icons of their day. The most celebrated Clairtone designs were the striking &quot;Project G&quot; series, introduced in 1964, composed of sleek rosewood cabinets with cantilevered black aluminum &quot;sound globes&quot; (speakers). The Project G and G2 were seen in the films &quot;Marriage on the Rocks&quot; and &quot;The Graduate,&quot; awarded a silver medal for excellence at the Milan Triennial design exhibition, and endorsed by Frank Sinatra and Oscar Peterson. Fans of the Project G included Hugh Hefner.

Clairtone&#x27;s downfall began with &quot;an ill-advised plan to build a plant in Nova Scotia.&quot; The plant, built in Stellarton, opened in 1966 with funding from the province&#x27;s Industrial Estates Limited (IEL). According to William Mingo, chief counsel for IEL, as quoted in his daughter Nina Munk&#x27;s book about Clairtone, &quot;Munk was too good a salesman for his own good. He could sell anything to anyone, including himself. My, he was a promoter. My, he had energy. My, he had charm. My, he had imagination.&quot; In 1967, as a result of mounting losses and in order to try to recoup its multi-million dollar investments, the Government of Nova Scotia took over Clairtone and fired Munk and Gilmour. Munk faced accusations of insider trading &quot;that were eventually settled out of court.&quot; A report commissioned by Clairtone in the aftermath of the factory&#x27;s failure found that one of the main issues was the local workforce. &quot;The general population is basically not geared to the manufacturing frenzy and especially the five-day workweek... The welfare situation is such that it has created conditions similar to Appalachia in the United States where the third generation is already on relief.&quot;

===Hospitality and real estate===
After the collapse of Clairtone, Munk and Gilmour invested in a plot of ocean-front land in Fiji which they soon developed into a hotel and resort. This venture grew into the Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation, which at its peak consisted of 54 resorts in Australia and the South Pacific. In 1978, the firm signed a deal with the President of Egypt to build a resort near the Great Pyramids. When Anwar Sadat cancelled the project, Munk sued the Egyptian government, eventually winning the arbitration case at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

In 1979, Munk returned to Canada to start a new venture called Barrick, which he would eventually build into the world&#x27;s largest gold company. At the time, bankers and the establishment viewed him as &quot;a fugitive and a loser,&quot; according to Munk.

Munk was also founder, chairman, and CEO of Trizec Properties (formerly TrizecHahn Corporation), one of the largest American real estate investment trusts. In 2006, Trizec Properties was sold to Brookfield Properties in a transaction valued at approximately $9 billion.

In 2007, Munk invested with partners in Porto Montenegro, a former naval base on the Adriatic Sea, turning it into a superyacht destination to rival Cannes and Monte Carlo. He was the majority shareholder of Montport Capital, which owned the centrepieces of the complex, Porto Montenegro Marina and Resort. He developed the site on the Bay of Kotor, putting Montenegro on the map for high-end tourism. In 2016 Munk sold the marina and hotel to Investment Corporation of Dubai, a sovereign wealth fund, for an undisclosed amount, believed to be about 200 million euros.

===Barrick Gold===

In 1980, Munk created Barrick Petroleum to invest in the oil sector, but he quickly realized that investments in this sector were ruinous. After the acquisition of a small company, Camflo Mines, Barrick left the oil sector and became overnight a mining company. In 2011, Munk planned to merge with Glencore, Ivan Glasenberg&#x27;s company, to create one of the world&#x27;s largest commodities giants on par with BHP and Rio Tinto. The gold market was not aligned with Glencore&#x27;s other activities, however, and the deal did not go through.

In 2008, Munk, as the chair of Barrick Gold, intervened at the shareholder meeting to block a proxy shareholder, who had travelled from Papua New Guinea for the meeting, from speaking about her reports of deadly violence and sexual violence perpetuated by Barrick Gold&#x27;s security contractors at Porgera Gold Mine. 

By 2016, Barrick had proven and probable reserves of two billion tons (1.33 grams of gold per tonne of ore). It is the world&#x27;s largest gold mining company and the largest Canadian company by capitalization. Munk retired from the day-to-day management but he remained the founder and President Emeritus. &quot;Barrick is my legacy,&quot; Munk said.

==Charitable contributions==
In 1992, the Peter and Melanie Munk Charitable Foundation was founded. It has disbursed more than $300 million to a variety of organizations that work to improve the health, education and international reputation of Canadians. In a speech he delivered in September 2017, on announcing a $100 million donation to the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre at the Toronto General Hospital, Munk spoke of his philanthropy in the context of his gratitude to the country that saved his life: &quot;You opened the door. You gave us everything,&quot; he added, referring to Canada as &quot;paradise.&quot;

===Education===
Munk was a major donor to the University of Toronto, his &quot;alma mater&quot;. Beginning with a gift of $35 million in 2010, the Munk Foundation enabled the establishment of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. In total, Munk gave $51 million to his alma mater. The &quot;Peter Munk Professor of Entrepreneurship&quot; at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management is named after him.

Peter Munk also made a substantial donation of $43 million to Technion – Israel Institute of Technology to establish that university&#x27;s Peter Munk Research Institute.

===Public policy===
In 2016, Munk made a $5 million donation to the Fraser Institute, a think tank, to launch the Peter Munk Centre for Free Enterprise Education. 
====Aurea Foundation====
Peter Munk and Melanie Munk established the Aurea Foundation in 2006.
Subsequently, Peter Munk established the semi-annual Munk Debates in 2008 with a $12 million donation from Aurea Foundation, a sub-division of his primary charitable foundation.

===Health===
In 1997, Munk helped create the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre at the Toronto General Hospital with an initial donation of $6 million. In May 2006, he announced that he would donate another $37 million, at the time the largest gift ever made to a Canadian medical institution. In September 2017, he donated another $100 million. As well, Peter and Melanie Munk established University Health Network’s first endowed chair for the cardiac program: the Melanie Munk Chair in Cardiovascular Surgery.

===Controversy===
A contract between the Munk Foundation and the University of Toronto came under criticism due to the secrecy that shrouded its approval, and the fact that Munk&#x27;s contribution of $35 million were conditional on $25 million contributions each by the federal government and the university. Coming at a time of downsizing and threats to the funding of other academic units, critics charge that these decisions are emblematic of the government&#x27;s and the University&#x27;s ceding of academic resource allocation decisions to the corporate sector.

According to Linda McQuaig&#x27;s book, &quot;The Trouble with Billionaires&quot;, Munk&#x27;s donation to the University of Toronto came with strings attached to ensure that the school would &quot;fit with the political views and sensitivities of Peter Munk.&quot; McQuaig writes that &quot;according to Munk&#x27;s written agreement with the university, the Munk donations will be paid over an extended time period, with much of the money to be paid years from now – and subject to the Munk family&#x27;s approval of the school. For that matter, the school&#x27;s director will be required to report annually to a board appointed by Munk &#x27;to discuss the programs, activities and initiatives of the School in greater detail.&#x27;&quot;

University president David Naylor rejected personal attacks on donors as &quot;a deplorable affront to the values of rational and respectful discourse that are supposed to characterize a university&quot; and stated &quot;I later served on the board of the University Health Network, in the years when Dr. Munk made two gifts exceeding $40 million to support the cardiovascular program at that hospital. There was not a single instance where Peter Munk interfered with the educational, research or clinical priorities of the institution.&quot;

==Personal life==
On September 3, 1956, Munk married Linda Joy Gutterson, the daughter of a Forest Hill pharmaceutical entrepreneur who gave Munk the start-up capital to fund his first company. Linda was 19, not long out of Havergal College; he was 10 years older. &quot;&#x27;Linda tracked me down with a laser beam,&#x27; said Munk. &#x27;I was a curiosity; I was different. Not because I was so great, let me tell you, I was fat, bald, poor, a boring engineering student.&#x27;&quot; The couple separated and reunited more than once in the 1960s, having three children and divorcing in 1970 but staying on very good terms. After the marriage was over, she pursued an academic career, becoming a professor of English at the University of Toronto.

On June 26, 1973, Munk married his second wife, Melanie Jane Bosanquet, in London with whom he had two more children. She is the cousin of Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, a British land-owner and Olympic skier. Munk skied for 71 years, and built with his wife in 1972 a ski chalet called Viti Levu in Klosters, which they consider home. It overlooks the mountain of Gotschnagrat.

His children are: Anthony Munk, a senior managing director at Onex private equity; Nina Munk, a journalist and contributing editor for &quot;Vanity Fair;&quot; Marc-David Munk, a physician and healthcare executive; Natalie; and Cheyne. In his late 70s Munk was fitted with a pacemaker.

== Views ==
In 2008, Munk praised Canada for being a place where he could come as an immigrant, without wealth, knowledge, language skills or a network and set up a successful business and grow it into an empire.

==Death==
Munk died in Toronto on March 28, 2018, at the age of 90. The cause of death was not disclosed, but Munk had been dealing with heart problems for several years and wore a pacemaker.

&quot;The Financial Post&quot; posthumously lauded him as &quot;An entrepreneur with a Midas touch, he was one of Canada&#x27;s most high-flying, international deal makers, with friends ranging from Brian Mulroney and Prince Charles to the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and French billionaire Bernard Arnault, as well as one its most generous benefactors.&quot;

==Honours==
He received several honorary degrees:
* Doctorate from Upsala College, New Jersey in 1991
* Doctorate from Bishop&#x27;s University, Quebec in 1995
* Doctor of Laws from Trinity College, University of Toronto in 1995
* Doctorate from Concordia University, Montreal in 1999
* Doctorate from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel in 2001
* Doctor of Sacred Letters from Trinity College, University of Toronto in 2004, jointly with his wife Melanie Munk

He became Officer of The Order of Canada (the country&#x27;s highest civilian honour) in 1993 and was promoted to Companion in 2008; received The Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship in 2002 (the first time awarded outside the U.S.); was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame. In 2012 Munk was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. His homeland awarded him the Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary in 2016.

<text>A Torah scroll (, , lit. &quot;Book of Torah&quot;; plural: ) is a handwritten copy of the Torah, meaning the five books of Moses (the first books of the Hebrew Bible). The Torah scroll is mainly used in the ritual of Torah reading during Jewish prayers. At other times, it is stored in the holiest spot within a synagogue, the Torah ark, which is usually an ornate curtained-off cabinet or section of the synagogue built along the wall that most closely faces Jerusalem, the direction Jews face when praying.

The text of the Torah is also commonly printed and bound in book form for non-ritual functions, called a (plural ; &quot;five-part&quot;, for the five books of Moses), and is often accompanied by commentaries or translations.

==History==
Findings from Qumran, Masada, and the Bar Kokhba refuge caves indicate that biblical scrolls were abundant and widely circulated in late Second Temple Judaea.

===Single-scroll Pentateuch===

The researchers working on the En-Gedi Scroll have concluded that by the fourth century CE, there was no halakhic rule yet prescribing that scrolls used for liturgical purposes must contain the entire Pentateuch. As of 2018, no other statements regarding when this rule came into being could be made with any degree of certainty. It must be noted that, while the physically determined date for the scroll points to the 3rd or 4th centuries, its text has been palaeographically dated by Ada Yardeni to the first century CE or the early second at the latest, a discrepancy not uncommon in this field, which could push back in time the entire discussion.

===En-Gedi Scroll=== 
The En-Gedi Scroll is a Hebrew parchment radiocarbon-dated to the 3rd or 4th century CE (88.9% certainty for 210–390 CE), although paleographical considerations suggest that it may date back to the 1st or early 2nd century CE. The charred scroll, found &quot;in situ&quot; in the synagogue&#x27;s Torah niche, was discovered to contain a portion of Leviticus, making it the earliest copy of a Pentateuchal book ever found in a Holy Ark. The deciphered text fragment is identical to what was to become during the Middle Ages the standard text of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic Text, which it precedes by several centuries; it thus constitutes the earliest evidence of this authoritative text version. The scroll is badly charred and fragmented and required noninvasive scientific techniques to virtually unwrap and read.

==Usage==
Torah reading from a Torah scroll or &quot;Sefer Torah&quot; is traditionally reserved for Monday and Thursday mornings, as well as for Shabbat, fast days, and Jewish holidays. The presence of a quorum of ten Jewish adults (&quot;minyan&quot;) is required for the reading of the Torah to be held in public during the course of the worship services. As the Torah is sung, following the often dense text is aided by a &quot;yad&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;), a metal or wooden hand-shaped pointer that protects the scrolls by avoiding unnecessary contact of the skin with the parchment.

All Jewish prayers start with a blessing (&quot;berakhah&quot;), thanking God for revealing the Law to the Jews (&quot;Matan Torah&quot;), before Torah reading and all days during the first blessings of the morning prayer (&quot;Shacharit&quot;).

==Production==


According to halakha (Jewish law), a Torah scroll is a copy of the Hebrew text of the Torah handwritten on special types of parchment by using a quill or another permitted writing utensil, dipped in ink. Producing a Torah scroll fulfills one of the 613 commandments.

Written entirely in Biblical Hebrew, a Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained scribe, or &quot;sofer&quot;, an effort which may take as long as approximately one and a half years. An error during transcription may render the Torah scroll &quot;pasul&quot; (&quot;invalid&quot;).

===Parchment and ink===
According to the Talmud, all scrolls must be written on &quot;gevil&quot; parchment that is treated with salt, flour and &quot;m&#x27;afatsim&quot; (a residue of wasp enzyme and tree bark) in order to be valid. Scrolls not processed in this way are considered invalid.

There are only two types of kosher parchment allowed for a Torah scroll: &quot;gevil&quot; and &quot;klaf&quot;.
The ink used is subject to specific rules. The ink needs to adhere to a surface that flexes and bends as the scroll is rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink slowly flakes off with time and use; if ink from too many letters wears away, a Torah scroll is rendered &quot;pasul&quot; (&quot;invalid&quot;) and can no longer be used.

===Scribal work===
After the preparation of the parchment sheet, the scribe must mark out the parchment using the &quot;sargel&quot; (&quot;ruler&quot;) ensuring the guidelines are straight. Only the top guide is done and the letters suspended from it. Most modern Torah scrolls are written with forty-two (42) lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty-one (51)). Very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew alphabet are observed. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care.

Some errors are inevitable in the course of production. If the error involves a word other than the names of God the mistaken letter may be obliterated from the scroll by scraping the letter off the scroll with a sharp object. If the name of God is written in error, the entire page must be cut from the scroll and a new page added, and the page written anew from the beginning. The new page is sewn into the scroll to maintain continuity of the document. The old page is treated with appropriate respect, and is buried with respect rather than being otherwise destroyed or discarded.

The completion of the Torah scroll is a cause for great celebration, and honoured guests of the individual who commissioned the Torah are invited to a celebration wherein each of the honored guests is given the opportunity to write one of the final letters. It is a great honour to be chosen for this.

==Commandment to write a scroll==
It is a religious duty or &quot;mitzvah&quot; for every Jewish male to either write or have written for him a Torah scroll. Of the 613 commandments, one – the 82nd as enumerated by Rashi, and the final as it occurs in the text the Book of Deuteronomy () – is that every Jewish male should write a Torah scroll in his lifetime. This is law number 613 of 613 in the list of Laws of the Torah as recorded by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin in his book &quot;Biblical Literacy&quot;, 1st edition, New York: Morrow 1997, p. 592: &quot;The commandment that each Jew should write a Torah scroll during his lifetime.&quot;

It is considered a tremendous merit to write (or commission the writing of) a Torah scroll, and a significant honour to have a Torah scroll written in one&#x27;s honour or memory.

==Professional scribes (&quot;soferim&quot;)==

In modern times, it is usual for some scholars to become &quot;soferim&quot; and to be paid to complete a Torah scroll under contract on behalf of a community or by individuals to mark a special occasion or commemoration. Because of the work involved, these can cost tens of thousands of US dollars to produce to ritually proper standards.

==Printed Torah (&quot;Chumash&quot;)==

A printed version of the Torah is known colloquially as a Chumash (plural &quot;Chumashim&quot;). Although strictly speaking it is known as Chamishah Chumshei Torah (Five &quot;Fifths&quot; of Torah). They are treated as respected texts, but not anywhere near the level of sacredness accorded a Torah scroll, which is often a major possession of a Jewish community. A &quot;chumash&quot; contains the Torah and other writings, usually organised for liturgical use, and sometimes accompanied by some of the main classic commentaries.

==Torah ark==
While not in use, a Torah scroll (&quot;Sefer Torah&quot;) is housed in the Torah ark (&quot;Aron Kodesh&quot; or &quot;Hekhal&quot;), which in its turn is usually veiled by an embroidered parochet (curtain), as it should be according to .

==Torah decorations==


The gold and silver ornaments belonging to the scroll are collectively known as &quot;kele kodesh&quot; (sacred vessels). The scroll itself will often be girded with a strip of silk (see wimpel) and &quot;robed&quot; with a piece of protective fine fabric, called the &quot;Mantle of the Law&quot;. It is decorated with an ornamental priestly breastplate, scroll-handles (&quot;‘etz ḥayyim&quot;), and the principal ornament—the &quot;Crown of the Law&quot;, which is made to fit over the upper ends of the rollers when the scroll is closed. Some scrolls have two crowns, one for each upper end. The metalwork is often made of beaten silver, sometimes gilded. The scroll-handles, breastplate and crown often have little bells attached to them.

The housing has two rollers, each of which has two handles used for scrolling the text, four handles in all. Between the handles and the rollers are round plates or disks which are carved with images of holy places, engraved with dedications to the donor&#x27;s parents or other loved ones, and decorated with gold or silver.

===Mizrachi and Romaniote traditions===
In the Mizrachi and Romaniote traditions, the Torah scroll is generally not robed in a mantle, but rather housed in an ornamental wooden case which protects the scroll, called a &quot;tik&quot;, plural &quot;tikim&quot;. Some Sephardic communities — those communities associated with the Spanish diaspora, such as Moroccan Jews, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews (with the exception of the Hamburg tradition), and the Judaeo-Spanish communities of the Ottoman Empire — also use &quot;tikim,&quot; though this is not always the case.

==Inauguration==
The installation of a new Torah scroll into a synagogue, or into the sanctuary or study hall (&quot;beth midrash&quot;) of a religious school (&quot;yeshiva&quot;), rabbinical college, university campus, nursing home, military base, or other institution, is done in a ceremony known as &quot;hachnosas sefer Torah&quot;, or &quot;ushering in a Torah scroll&quot;; this is accompanied by celebratory dancing, singing, and a festive meal.

===Biblical roots===
This practice has its source in the escorting of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, led by King David. As described in the Books of Samuel, this event was marked by dancing and the playing of musical instruments (). Both the priests or &quot;kohanim&quot; and David himself &quot;danced before the Ark&quot; or &quot;danced before the Lord&quot;.

==Handling the scroll==

Special prayers are recited when the Torah scroll is removed from the ark and the text is chanted, rather than spoken, in a special melodic manner (see Cantillation and Nigun). Whenever the scroll is opened to be read it is laid on a piece of cloth called the &quot;mappah&quot;. When the Torah scroll is carried through the synagogue, the members of the congregation may touch the edge of their prayer shawl (&quot;tallit&quot;) to the Torah scroll and then kiss the shawl as a sign of respect.
As it is important to guard the sanctity of a Torah, dropping it, or allowing it to fall, is regarded as 
a desecration.

<text>Haarzuilens is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Utrecht, and lies about 12 km west from the city centre of Utrecht. It was a separate municipality until 1954, when it was joined to the municipality of Vleuten. 

Website: www.haarzuilens.com

In 2018, the village of Haarzuilens has about 500 inhabitants.

Pronounced “&quot;Harzollens&quot;” by the local Dutch inhabitants, the village was built around the turn of the 19th century after its predecessor and the local castle De Haar had been destroyed in a devastating fire. The trees surrounding the castle are said to have originated in a forest on the other side of Utrecht. Local lore has it that several houses in Utrecht were demolished in order to move the trees to their new location and to give the castle&#x27;s landlord his forest without the decades of delay usually required to grow new trees. Nevertheless, the landlord allegedly went on a five-year honeymoon trip before the trees had been replanted.

It is famous for De Haar Castle, which is surrounded by gardens and which is the location of the annual Elf Fantasy Fair. The castle, after 1892 fully refurbished by the Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and owned by baron since 2000, attracted 76,500 visitors in 2002.

<text>James Edmund Groppi (November 16, 1930 – November 4, 1985) was an erstwhile Catholic priest and noted civil rights activist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He became well known for leading numerous protests, many times being arrested during them. In 1976, he was excommunicated by the church for marrying. In 1985, he died of brain cancer at the age of 54.

==Early years, education, ordination as priest==
James Groppi was born in the Bay View neighborhood on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Italian immigrant parents. Giocondo and Giorgina Groppi had twelve children, of which James was the eleventh. In this working-class community, Giocondo joined others from Italy in Milwaukee&#x27;s grocery business, opening &quot;Groppi&#x27;s&quot; store in Bay View, where James and his siblings worked. Typical of boys in heavily Catholic south side Milwaukee, James attended a parochial grade school (Immaculate Conception), but went on to the public high school in Bay View, where he was captain of the basketball team in his senior year.

A year after graduation, James Groppi enrolled at St. Lawrence Seminary (1950–1952) in Mount Calvary, Wisconsin. According to writer Frank Aukofer, &quot;It was during his seminary years that Father Groppi began developing an empathy with the Black poor. He worked summers at a youth center in Milwaukee&#x27;s inner core. It was there that he saw the social suffering and ostracism that Negroes lived with every day&quot;. Groppi was ordained to the priesthood in June 1959 after studying at St. Francis Seminary (1952–1959).

==Civil rights activism==
At first assigned to St. Veronica&#x27;s Church in Milwaukee, in 1963 Groppi was transferred to St. Boniface, the latter parish having a predominantly African-American congregation. Groppi became interested in – and active in – the cause of civil rights for Africans-Americans, participating in the 1963 March on Washington and the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 on behalf of the Voting Rights Act. He also participated in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference voter registration project in the South, led by Martin Luther King Jr., during the summer of 1965.

Later in 1965, Groppi returned to Milwaukee, becoming the advisor to the Milwaukee chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Youth Council, organizing protests against the segregation of Milwaukee public schools. He served as advisor to the Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council until 1968. He also became second vice president of Milwaukee United School Integration Committee (1965–1966).

==Civil rights leader==
In his capacity as NAACP advisor, Groppi organized an all-Black male group called the Milwaukee Commandos. They were formed to protect marchers and help quell violence during the &quot;Freedom Marches.&quot; With the NAACP Youth Council, Groppi mounted a lengthy, continuous demonstration against the city of Milwaukee on behalf of fair housing. He led these fair housing marches across the 16th Street Viaduct (since renamed in his honor) spanning the Menomonee River Valley. The half-mile wide valley was considered to be a symbolic divide for the city. Throughout this period, he received both physical and moral support from human rights activists like Dick Gregory and Martin Luther King Jr. Though Groppi was denigrated and arrested on numerous occasions for standing firm in his beliefs, he was instrumental in dramatizing the segregated housing situation in Milwaukee. These efforts led to enactment of an open-housing law in the city. 

In 1966 Groppi acted on common knowledge in the Milwaukee area that most judges and elected officials belonged to the Fraternal Order of Eagles, which at the time did not admit people of color to its membership. He questioned how a judge who was a member of an organization that did not welcome African-Americans as members could rule impartially in cases involving African-Americans. He organized pickets at the homes of some of the member judges, most notably Circuit Court Judge Robert Cannon, despite the fact that Cannon was a liberal and had voiced opposition to the Eagles&#x27; membership policies. These demonstrations continued, on and off, until 1967. During this period, Groppi also worked for passage of legislation which would outlaw discrimination in the buying and renting of homes (in 1968 such a law was passed on the federal level, known as the Fair Housing Act).

In 1968 Groppi was awarded the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award by the Davenport Catholic Interracial Council. It was named after a 1963 encyclical by Pope John XXIII that called upon people of good will to secure peace among all nations. &quot;Pacem in terris&quot; is Latin for &quot;Peace on earth&quot;.

On September 29, 1969, Groppi organized and led the &quot;Welfare Mothers&#x27; March on Madison,&quot; during which over 1,000 welfare mothers marched into Wisconsin&#x27;s State Assembly chamber, seizing it in protest against planned welfare cuts. Groppi and his supporters held the State Assembly chamber in a sitdown strike for 11 hours before police recovered the chamber. Cited in a bill of attainder for &quot;contempt of the State Assembly&quot; and sentenced to six months in jail, Groppi appealed to the federal courts, which quickly reversed his conviction. His last appeal was to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in &quot;Groppi v. Leslie&quot; invalidated the contempt citation on notice and due process grounds.

==Later years and death==
Groppi&#x27;s ecclesiastical superiors did not always approve of his activities and transferred him to St. Michael&#x27;s Church in 1970. Groppi repeatedly requested to be assigned to a parish in the African-American community, several of which were opened in the archdiocese during his priesthood, but he was consistently rebuffed. Groppi eventually resigned from the priesthood in 1976 and began studies at Antioch School of Law.

Groppi later married Margaret Rozga, who became an English professor at the University of Wisconsin–Waukesha. They had three children together. 

From 1975 to 1976, Groppi worked for the Tri-County Voluntary Service Committee, where he was responsible for recruiting and supervising VISTA volunteers in Racine, Kenosha and Walworth counties. He rose again to public attention when he joined Marlon Brando to mediate the clash between the Menominee Indians and the Alexian Brothers at the Alexian Novitiate in Gresham, Wisconsin, in 1975. The Menominee wanted to reclaim the land on which the Novitiate is located.

Groppi attended the Virginia Theological Seminary (Episcopal) in Alexandria, Virginia, during the fall of 1978. In January 1979, he continued preparations for the Episcopal priesthood by working for St. Andrews Church, an inner-city parish in Detroit, Michigan. However, his lifelong commitment to Catholicism caused him to question whether it was spiritually possible for him to continue conversion to the Episcopal priesthood, and he aborted that pursuit later that year.

In 1977, Groppi became a bus driver for the Milwaukee County Transit System. In 1983 he was elected president of the bus drivers&#x27; local union, ATU 998. In 1984, he became partially paralyzed following an unsuccessful surgery that aimed to remove a cancerous brain tumor. He died the following year due to complications of the same cancer.

His papers are maintained at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

<doc id="979031" wikidata="Q16902924" url="?curid=979031" title="Warwick Arts Centre">
<text>Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England. It attracts around 300,000 visitors a year to over 3,000 individual events embracing all types of theatre and performance, contemporary and classical music, dance, comedy, visual art, films, talks and family events. Warwick Arts Centre is the largest arts centre in the Midlands, and the largest venue of its kind in the UK outside the Barbican Centre in London.

Warwick Arts Centre consists of numerous spaces on the same site, including a large 1,500 capacity concert hall, theatre, three cinemas, art gallery (Mead Gallery), Helen Martin Studio and conference room, as well as learning space, hospitality suites, a café and bars.

The centre houses the University of Warwick Music Centre with practice rooms, and an ensemble rehearsal room where music societies and groups rehearse.

== History ==

The Arts Centre was the brainchild of first vice-chancellor Jack Butterworth and American benefactor Helen Martin – who was at the time anonymous.

Commissioned in 1970 – and opened in October 1974 – the Arts Centre was designed by architects Renton, Howard, Wood Associates, and the building went on to win a RIBA award. initially with a theatre, studio theatre, conference room and a music centre, the venue was expanded further with the larger Butterworth Hall in 1981 and Mead Gallery, along with a cinema, in 1986.

Following a four-year redevelopment, the largest in its history, the Arts Centre reopened to events in October 2021. Work included extensive upgrades of existing spaces, a new foyer, three new cinemas, and a new restaurant.

This was followed in January 2022 with the reopening of the repositioned Mead Gallery. With a floor area of 6,458sq ft, it&#x27;s the largest single dedicated contemporary exhibition space in the region.

In autumn 2024, Warwick Arts Centre celebrated its 50th anniversary &quot;with a programme honouring community creativity and its power to make change&quot;. The programme was entitled Rebels With A Cause!

Among those who&#x27;ve visited the Arts Centre are Terry Pratchett, Jeremy Irons, Jimmy Carr, Eddie Izzard, Hugh Laurie, Ken Loach, and Russell Brand, as well as Motionhouse, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Chineke! Orchestra, Goodness Gracious Me, The Smiths, Jasper Carrott, Kirsty McColl, Yehudi Menuhin, Kiri Te Kanawa, Nigel Kennedy and Evelyn Glennie.

Warwick Arts Centre has been described as &quot;one of the best places in the Midlands to watch theatre, comedy and other shows&quot; with the building providing a &quot;vibrant showcase for the very best in contemporary art, events and entertainment.&quot;
== Mead Gallery ==

Warwick Arts Centre&#x27;s dedicated visual arts space, Mead Gallery, opened in May 1986. It was named to honour Phil Mead, a Coventry businessman who worked to develop support for the University and for Warwick Arts Centre, and designed by Renton Howard Wood Levine. It is a large, L-shaped space and presents three white cubes, which can be divided into three galleries.

The Mead opened with two exhibitions: &quot;Surprises In Store: Fifty Years of British Art&quot; (featuring work by Barbara Hepworth, L. S. Lowry, Paul Nash, Bridget Riley and others), and an exhibition exploring stage designs and sculptures by Fernand Léger.

Other artists who have had their work showcased by Mead over the years include sculptors Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Henry Moore, Elisabeth Frink, David Nash, and Liliane Lijn; photographers Robert Doisneau, Bill Brandt, Fay Godwin, Willy Ronis, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange; and printmaker Hokusai. Further exhibitions have highlighted the work of Steve McQueen, Peter Lanyon, Tom Phillips, Graham Sutherland, John Piper, Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Hurvin Anderson, Grayson Perry, Douglas Gordon, Jeremy Deller, Joseph Beuys, Tacita Dean, and Olafur Eliasson.

The gallery closed in 2018 as part of the Warwick Arts Centre 20:20 Project to redevelop the building, reopening in January 2022 with Rana Begum: &quot;Dappled Light&quot;.

== The Koan ==

A distinctive feature outside of the arts centre is White Koan by American-born artist Liliane Lijn, which was purchased by the university in 1972.

Taking the form of a rotating, conical construction with light-up elements, the piece combines industrial materials and artistic processes. Liliane is known for exploring the interaction between art, science, technology and eastern philosophy and mythology.

A number of popular myths have grown around the piece since it was installed, including that it was the nose cone of a failed Apollo mission, and has several nightclubs underneath it.

The work forms part of the Sculpture Park which also includes work by Richard Deacon, Peter Randall-Page, Laura Ford, David Nash, Allen Jones, Jake and Dinos Chapman and others.

<doc id="979039" wikidata="Q175976" url="?curid=979039" title="Top10 (rugby union)">
<text>The Top10, known as the [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] Top10 for sponsorship reasons, and formerly Top 12, is Italy&#x27;s top level professional men&#x27;s rugby union competition. The Top 10 is run by Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) and is contested by 10 teams as of the 2019–2020 season, following the Italian federation&#x27;s decision to name Peroni as the official partner of the Top10 competition.

The leading teams qualify to play against teams from the other leading rugby union nations in Europe in the European Challenge Cup. Aironi and Benetton Treviso began competing in the league now known as Pro14 in the 2010–11 season, and took both Italian places in the Heineken Cup. Owing to financial problems, the FIR revoked Aironi&#x27;s professional licence after the 2011–12 season; that team was replaced in Pro12 by the FIR-operated Zebre. From 2014 to 2015, one of the two Italian Pro12 sides competes in the Heineken Cup&#x27;s replacement, the European Rugby Champions Cup; the other plays in the European Rugby Challenge Cup. Both Pro12 teams are intended to concentrate the best domestic talent and help develop the quality of Italian players and therefore improve the talent pool for the national team.

==History==

The competition was originally named Divisione Nazionale since its origin in 1928 until the 1945–46 season where the name of the National Championship was changed to the Serie A. Upon 1959, the competition&#x27;s name was changed was changed to the Eccellenza before becoming the Serie A once again 26 years after in 1985. However, shortly after the name change, in 1986 the Serie A became the Serie A1 with the second tier taking the name of the Serie A2.

Since the 1987–88 season, the championship has been played under a play-off phase format after a regular season with the title being assigned through a final (several cities to have hosted finals include Padua, Bologna and Rome). After a major restructuring in 2001, the national championship was named Super 10 leaving the Serie A1 and Serie A2 to become the second and third divisions of Italian rugby respectively. Upon the 2009–10 season, the Super 10 championship which was founded (in 2001) and operated by the L.I.R.E. (Lega Italiana Rugby d&#x27;Eccellenza) (&quot;Italian Elite Rugby Union League&quot; in Italian) had folded in 2009, the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) had taken over organising the championship.

The name of championship was changed once again to the Eccellenza for the 2010–11 season. After 8 years of the Eccellenza, the competition was increased to 12 teams and was rebranded as the Top12.

Upon the year 2010, the then known Celtic League (now the Pro14) had decided to expand their competition to 12 teams and add two Italian teams, one of them being Benetton Treviso (which would mean they would stop participating in the Super 10 and another being Aironi (a newly founded team that was later replaced by Zebre in the 2012–2013 season of the Pro 12 after folding due to financial reasons and having its license revoked by the Italian Rugby Federation).

The competition&#x27;s name was changed from Top 12 to Top 10 in 2020 when teams I Medicei and San Donà withdrew their participation.

From 2023-24 season, competition is going to a reduction of teams, from 10 to 9 (with the leak of Calvisano), and 8 from 2024-25 with also the come back of name in Serie A Elite.
From 2024-25 season, competition confirmed with 10 teams.

==Current teams==

The leading title holder is Amatori Milano who have won eighteen titles (the first one in 1929, the most recent in 1996) before being disbanded in 2011; Benetton Treviso follow with fifteen (first in 1956 as Rugby Treviso); Petrarca (rugby union club from Padua that won their first title in 1970) with thirteen and Rovigo (first title in 1951) who won twelve titles.
Apart from the aforementioned teams no one has won more than five titles. The team that wins the Italian championship wears the &quot;Scudetto&quot; on their jerseys the following season, The clubs that hold at least ten titles win the right to wear a golden star on their jerseys.

==Celtic League participation==
Despite rising playing standards and more media attention on rugby union, Italian teams competing in the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup have generally struggled to compete against the established club teams of the other Six Nations countries. In response both John Kirwan, the former Italian head coach, and David Pickering, the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, suggested that merged Italian teams should enter the Celtic League, now known as Pro14, and in March 2009 the Celtic Rugby Board and FIR announced an agreement in principle to add two Italian teams to the Magners League for 2010–11. The two teams were intended to offer Italian qualified players a higher standard of rugby to hone their skills. It removed the best Italian players from the top-tier league, and it was envisaged that the Super 10 would be a semi-professional league.

On 18 July 2009 it was announced that the two Magners League teams would be the newly formed Aironi, based in Viadana, and &quot;Praetorians Roma&quot;, from the capital. As of October 2009, there was a change and it was announced the two teams will be Aironi and Benetton Treviso. Praetorians Roma were nominated in the first round but failed to meet the criteria set down by the evaluators and Benetton Treviso took their place. These new sides also played in the Heinken Cup and Italy retained its four places in the Challenge Cup, which were taken by top Super 10 teams, become Eccellenza, orphan of Benetton Treviso and Viadana.

After the 2011–12 season, the first for the league under the Pro12 name, the FIR revoked the licence of Aironi due to financial problems. That team was replaced in Pro12 by a new FIR operated side, Zebre.

Beginning in the 2014–15 season, the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup will be replaced by a new three-tiered European competition structure: the Heineken Cup will be replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Challenge Cup will be replaced by the European Rugby Challenge Cup, and a new third-tier Qualifying Competition will be added. The highest-placed Italian Pro12 side automatically qualifies for the Champions Cup, the other Pro12 side will compete in the new Challenge Cup unless it qualifies for the Champions Cup by being one of the three highest-placed teams apart from the top team of each Pro12 country (Italy, Ireland, Scotland, Wales). Select sides from the Excellence will play in the Qualifying Competition, to be held before the main season. Along with club sides from second-tier European rugby nations, the Eccellenza sides will compete for two places in the new European Rugby Challenge Cup with 4 teams. From the 2016–17 season the third-tier is named European Rugby Continental Shield.

==Format==
Currently the Italian senior leagues are structured in the following way:

*Top12 made up of 12 teams; the first four go into the playoff stage and the winner is the &quot;Champion of Italy&quot;; the last two classified are relegated in Serie A.
*Serie A: is the second level of Italian rugby union, divided in 3 same-rank territorial pools of 10 teams each, who play each other home and away. There are 4 relegations in Serie B, scheduled for the 3 teams that end the season in 10th place in their own pool and one of the three teams ranked 9th after a mini-playout. With the same scheme are organized the 4 promotions to Top12: the three teams that win their own pool automatically qualify for the finals, reached by one of the second teams after a mini-round of playoff. The finals, played home and away, are used to determine the two teams promoted to Top12.
*Serie B: divided in 4 same-rank territorial pools of 12 teams each, who play each other home and away. A playoff stage determines the 4 teams promoted to Serie A and a playout stage the 8 teams relegated in Serie C.
* Serie C: is the very 4th tier of Italian rugby union, divided into regional divisions. A playoffs stage determines the 8 teams that are promoted to Serie B.

<doc id="979043" wikidata="Q4337031" url="?curid=979043" title="Oropom language">
<text>Oropom (Oworopom, Oyoropom, Oropoi) is an African language, possibly spurious and, if real, almost certainly extinct. The language was purportedly once spoken by the Oropom people in northeastern Uganda and northwestern Kenya between the Turkwel River, the Chemorongit Mountains, and Mount Elgon.

==History of research==
There is only one article containing any original research on the language, Wilson (1970), which only a handful of other articles discuss. John G. Wilson&#x27;s article furnishes only a short word list, and was written at a time when the language, if it existed, was nearly extinct. The article was based mainly on the limited memories of two very old women, one &quot;a child of one of the residual Oropom families that had remained after the break-up of the Oropom here (Matheniko county)&quot; who &quot;remembered a few words of the language&quot;, the other an old lady called Akol &quot;descended from the prisoners taken by the Karimojong on the Turkwel&quot; who was &quot;able to furnish many Oropom words&quot;. Under the circumstances, only the barest details of Oropom could be ascertained.

On this basis, Wilson concluded that it must have had at least two dialects: one spoken around the Turkwel area, containing a significant number of Luo words, and some Bantu words, and one spoken around Matheniko county with fewer Luo words. Both contain Kalenjin loanwords.

==Classification==
Wilson ascribed it to the Khoisan group, seemingly based solely on its physical appearance; but this identification is unreliable; Harold C. Fleming describes it as a &quot;ridiculous suggestion&quot;. Elderkin (1983) says that &quot;The Oropom data of Wilson (1970) shows some resemblances to Kuliak, some of which could well be mediated through Nilotic, with which it seems to have more resemblances (F. Rottland, personal communication)... There are many fewer resemblances worth noting with Hadza and only a minimal number with Sandawe.&quot; He quotes 8 potentially similar words between Oropom and Hadza, and 4 between Oropom and Sandawe. Harold Fleming also notes that &quot;initial inspection suggests some possible commonality&quot; between Oropom and the Kuliak languages, a probably Nilo-Saharan relic group found in Northern Uganda among such tribes as the Ik. However, in the absence of further work, Oropom remains an unclassified language.

==Skepticism==
Bernd Heine, who surveyed the area less than ten years after Wilson and found no trace of the language, expressed skepticism that it existed at all. Both Lionel Bender and Roger Blench have opined that the language was made up as a joke. Souag (2004) lists several motives Wilson&#x27;s informants might have had to fabricate the language, and observes that even in his article, Wilson notes that he had to deal with &quot;charlatans&quot; once word got out that he was looking for anyone with knowledge of the language.

==Wordlist==
This wordlist, taken from the appendix to Wilson (1970), is based on Akol&#x27;s memories (and thus is considered by Wilson as belonging to the &quot;Turkwell dialect&quot;). He says that he collected words from the other dialect as well, but apparently never published them. The list consists of less than a hundred words, which are likely to be all the vocabulary that will ever be known of the language.

<doc id="979049" wikidata="Q1815205" url="?curid=979049" title="Ticuna language">
<text>Ticuna, Tikuna, Tucuna or Tukuna is a language spoken by approximately 50,000 people in the Amazon Basin, including the countries of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. It is the native language of the Ticuna people and is considered &quot;stable&quot; by ethnologue. Ticuna is generally classified as a language isolate, but may be related to the extinct Yuri language (see Tïcuna-Yuri) and there has been some research indicating similarities between Ticuna and Carabayo. It is a tonal language, and therefore the meaning of words with the same phonemes can vary greatly simply by changing the tone used to pronounce them.

Tïcuna is also known as Magta, Maguta, Tucuna/Tukuna, and Tukna.

== Sociolinguistic situation ==

=== Brazil ===
Ticuna is the Indigenous language most widely spoken in Brazil.

Despite being home to more than 50% of the Ticunas, Brazil has only recently started to invest in native language education. Brazilian Ticunas now have a written literature and an education provided by the Brazilian National Foundation for the Indian (FUNAI) and the Ministry of Education. Textbooks in Ticuna are used by native teachers trained in both Portuguese and Ticuna to teach the language to the children. A large-scale project has been recording traditional narrations and writing them down to provide the literate Ticunas with some literature to practice with.

Ticuna education is not a privilege, but part of a wider project carried on by the Brazilian government to provide all significant minorities with education in their own language.

In 2012, the Brazilian government launched an educational campaign for the prevention of AIDS and violence against women, the first such campaign in Brazil ever conducted in an indigenous language.

=== Peru ===
Ticunas in Peru have had native language education at least since the 1960s. They use a writing system that was, apparently, the base for the development of the Brazilian one. However, much of the literature available to Peruvian Ticunas comprise standard textbooks.

=== Colombia ===
Colombian Ticunas are taught in Spanish, when they have access to school at all. Since the establishment of Ticuna schools in Brazil some have ventured to attend them .

=== Christian Ministries ===
A number of Christian ministries have reached the Ticuna people. These ministries have translated the bible into the native Ticuna language and even have a weekday radio show that is broadcast in Ticuna, Portuguese, and Spanish by the Latin American Ministries (LAM).

== Literacy ==
Besides its use at the Ticuna schools, the language has a dozen books published every year, both in Brazil and Peru. Those books employ a specially devised phonetic writing system using conventions similar to those found in Portuguese (except for K instead of C and the letter Ñ instead of NH) instead of the more complex scientific notation found, for instance, at the Language Museum.

In school Ticuna is taught formally. Children in schools typically in areas of Catholic Missionaries are also taught either Portuguese or Spanish as well.

== Linguistic structure ==
Ticuna is a fairly isolating language morphologically, meaning that most words consist of just one morpheme. However, Ticuna words usually have more than one syllable, unlike isolating languages such as Vietnamese. Ticuna is an unusually tonal language for South America, with over 10 mostly contour tones. Tones are only indicated orthographically, with diacritics, when confusion is likely. The six vowels may be nasal or laryngealized; consonants may also be glottalized. Glottal stop is spelled &quot;x&quot;, and the sixth vowel &quot;ü&quot;. Typologically, Ticuna word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), though unusually this can vary within the language.

Research has indicated isolated tonal languages with complex tones are more likely to occur in regions of higher humidity and higher mean average temperature because it is believed the vocal folds can produce less consistent tones in colder, drier air. Ticuna was one of the languages of focus in this study due to its prevalence—and complexity—of tones.

=== Classification ===
Some have tentatively associated the Ticuna language within the proposals of the macro-arawakano or with macro-tukano stocks, although these classifications are highly speculative given the lack of evidence. A more recent hypothesis has linked Yuri-Ticuna with the Saliban and Hoti languages in the Duho stock. However, the linguistic consensus is that Ticuna may actually be a language isolate in its present-day situation, since Yuri is extinct.

===Phonology===

;Vowels
Vowels qualities are . Vowels may be nasalized and/or show creaky voice, under which tones are lowered. There are diphthongs and that carry a single tone, contrasting with vowel sequences and that carry two tones.

;Tones
Ticuna has one of the largest tone inventories in the world with 8–12 phonemic tones depending on the dialect.

;Consonants
The consonants of Ticuna consist of the following phonemes:
Natively, Ticuna has no lateral or uvular consonants, although /l/ is found in some Spanish loanwords.

The affricate (spelled &quot;y&quot;) may be pronounced as , and also , but only before the vowel . A central vowel sound may also be pronounced as a back sound. Other sounds, are found in Spanish loans.

=== Syntax ===
Ticuna displays nominative/accusative alignment, with person, number, noun class, and clause type indexed on the verb via proclitics. Transitive and unergative verbs tend to favor an Subject-(Object)-Verb word order, while unaccusative verbs show a preference for Verb-Subject word order.

=== Common words ===

The counting words in Ticuna imply a base five system of counting as the word for five is the combination of &quot;one five&quot;. Six through nine all contain the same beginning &quot;naixmixwa rü&quot; and then append the values for one through four respectively (such that six is &quot;naixmixwa rü&quot; and &quot;wüxi&quot; meaning one).

=== Examples of spoken language ===

<text>Pora! (), meaning &quot;It&#x27;s time!&quot; in Ukrainian, is a civic youth organization (Black Pora!) and political party in Ukraine (Yellow Pora!) espousing nonviolent resistance and advocating increased national democracy. The group was established in 2004 (as only a civic youth organization) to coordinate young people&#x27;s opposition to the Kuchma government in opposition to what they claimed was the authoritarian governing style of Ukraine&#x27;s president Leonid Kuchma. After the Orange Revolution Pora! split up in two different entities, Black Pora! (since 2006 OPORA) and Yellow Pora!

==The civic youth organization==
Pora! was inspired and partly trained by members of the Serbian Otpor movement which helped bring down President Slobodan Milošević, and is also allied to related movements throughout Eastern Europe, including Kmara in the republic of Georgia (itself partly responsible for the downfall of President Eduard Shevardnadze), Zubr in Belarus (opposing President Alexander Lukashenko), Oborona in Russia, and MJAFT! in Albania.

According to Pora! has never received U.S. funding and that while 10 members traveled to Serbia in the spring of 2004 and met with Otpor leaders at a seminar in the city of Novi Sad, they paid for themselves.

Prior to the 2004 presidential election, pro-democracy movements such as Pora! had created political networks throughout Ukraine, including 150 groups responsible for spreading information and coordinating election monitoring, 72 regional centers, and 30,000 registered participants. This allowed Pora! to mobilize protesters after widespread reports of electoral fraud.

Pora! supported Viktor Yushchenko in protests following the disputed 2004 presidential election. It claimed to have about 10,000 members. Its methods have apparently been influenced by Gene Sharp&#x27;s manual &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot;. Apart from the mass demonstrations of the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;, the group&#x27;s tactics have included the use of visually striking posters showing confrontational images such as a giant boot crushing a cockroach, and stickers with &quot;revolutionary&quot; slogans such as &quot;Time to Arise!&quot;. Not surprisingly, this has aroused the ire of the Ukrainian authorities and Pora! activists have often been harassed and arrested. Pora! activists were arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (on what was reported President Leonid Kuchma&#x27;s personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition. Pora! was seen as being on the radical wing of the reform movement.

==The split==
After the success of the Orange Revolution in defeating election fraud, from early 2005 Pora formally split into two branches with different goals for the future. The difference, however, always existed without being publicly known, between the original Black Pora! - a student movement associated with civic resistance and anti-Kuchma campaigns and the Yellow Pora! – organized by a group of politicians more closely connected to oppositional parties in the Parliament – such as Nasha Ukraina (Our Ukraine) of Viktor Yuschenko and PRP (Reforms and Order Party).

Yellow Pora stated in January 2005 it focused on spreading its &quot;revolution&quot; to other countries, particularly Belarus and Russia. A Russian wing of Yellow PORA was created in December 2004 in order to harness the experience of successful democratic revolutions in Serbia, Georgia, and Ukraine (pora.org.ru).

==The political party==
Now Yellow Pora! is a Ukrainian political party registered on March 23, 2005. Yellow Pora was united with Party Reform and Order and founded bloc PRP-PORA for the parliamentary elections 2006. Vitali Klitschko was the head of this political bloc. At the parliamentary elections on 26 March 2006, this alliance won 1,47% of the popular vote and no seats. The alliance was disbanded after the election when the parties became members of different electoral alliances.

In the parliamentary elections on 30 September 2007, the party was part of the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc alliance, which won 72 out of 450 seats.

In the 2010 local elections the party biggest achievement was winning 3 seats in the Lviv City Council.

The party did not participate in the 2012 parliamentary elections. And again did not participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

In December 2022 the party was renamed &quot;Oberih&quot; ().

==OPORA==
Black Pora, functions mainly as a pro-democracy watchdog trying to clean Ukraine of &#x27;Kuchmism&#x27; (i.e. the legacy of the former authoritarian President Leonid Kuchma) and does not see the possibility of exporting its experience to other countries. Black Pora! remains a non-partisan movement and has formally registered as an NGO - All-Ukrainian Civic Organization Pora! Part of its public campaigns – such as the one aimed at pressuring major political parties to clean their electoral lists of notorious personalities – connected to the old regime or having criminal background. Around the March 2006 Parliamentary elections Black Pora changed its name to OPORA (Foundation) (, Russian: ОПОРА).

<text>The Romania national rugby union team, nicknamed Stejarii (&quot;The Oaks&quot;), has long been considered one of the stronger European teams outside the Six Nations. They have participated in all but one Rugby World Cup and currently compete in the first division of the European Nations Cup, which they won in 2017. Rugby union in Romania is administered by the Romanian Rugby Federation.

France first played rugby against Romania in 1924 when they tried to establish a rival to the Five Nations championship. Romania holds with 25 matches the record for the longest unbeaten run. Although not regarded as a first-tier team in more recent times, their history includes an away draw against Ireland, and wins against four (France, Italy, Scotland, Wales) of the other Six Nations Championship teams.

Romania played in every Rugby World Cup through to 2015, but were disqualified from the 2019 Rugby World Cup after fielding an ineligible player during the qualification process. In the 2023 Rugby World Cup which saw the teams return to the tournament, Romania was in Pool B and finished bottom; losing all of their matches.

==History==
===Early history===
The game itself was introduced by students returning with rugby balls from their studies in Paris to form clubs such as Stadiul Roman from 1913 onwards. Seventeen other teams would be formed in the capital, Bucharest.

Romania&#x27;s first international was played against the US in 1919. France first officially played rugby union against Romania in May 1924 when they tried to establish a rival to the Five Nations Championship (now the Six Nations). France were victorious by 59 points to 3.

Romania were one of three teams who entered the 1924 Olympics in Paris. France won 59–3, scoring 13 tries including four by the fine Stade Francais winger Adolphe Jaureguy. The United States then defeated Romania 39–0. Romania finishing third claimed the bronze medal. The Federaţia Română de Rugby was formed in 1931. In 1939 a team was formed in Braşov at an aircraft factory. This was the first team outside Bucharest.

===Post-World War II===



A generation of French school trained coaches from late 1940s, and 1950s built a system and led the national team to success of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. In this era Romania began to compete more regularly against the major nations. Their first win over France came in 1960 in Bucharest, in a tour match won by 11–5. In 1974 Romania won against France 15–10 in Bucharest, and the FIRA – Association of European Rugby championship. In 1975 Romania went for an 8-game tour to New Zealand, concluding in Wellington with a 10–10 draw against the Junior All Blacks. Exposure to international rugby developed the country&#x27;s game and they began to form their own distinctive style of play, built around strong, bruising packs. That Romania was emerging as a real force on the world stage became clear on their 1979 Romania rugby union tour of Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, in an unofficial, non-cap international. The Oaks led going into the dying minutes, when only a last-gasp drop goal from Gareth Davies gave a narrow 13–12 victory for Wales. The improvement continued in 1980, when Romania crushed the French in a record 15–0 win in Bucharest. A trip to Lansdowne Road in the 1980 Romania rugby union tour of Ireland then yielded a 13–13 draw against Ireland in another unofficial, non-cap match.

In the 1980s the country boasted more than 12,000 players in 110 clubs. Home nations sides began to award international caps for matches against Romania in 1981; Scotland were the first to do so when Romania visited them on their 1981 tour, Scotland winning the international by 12 points to 6. Wales travelled to Bucharest in November 1983 and were totally overwhelmed, falling to a 24–6 defeat. Romania&#x27;s first win over Scotland came in Bucharest in 1984 and their first away win against Five Nations opposition came in 1988 against Wales; 15–9 at Cardiff Arms Park.

Their national side beat Wales (twice – 1983: 24–6 in Romania, 1988: 15–9 in Wales), Scotland (the 1984 Grand Slam side 28–22 in Romania), France (twice 1980: 15–0 in Romania, 1982: 13–9 in Romania) and drew with Ireland (13–13, in 1980, at Dublin). In 1981, they lost to the All Blacks 14–6 but had two tries disallowed. Many felt it was wrong for the rugby union powers to fail to bring them into top-flight competition. Romania beat Zimbabwe 21–20 in their first ever Rugby World Cup match in 1987 but did not win any other games and failed to progress beyond the group stage.

===After the collapse of Communism===
However, with the deterioration of the domestic political and economic situation in the country in the 1990s, Romanian rugby union suffered; the two leading rugby union teams – Dinamo Bucharest and Steaua Bucharest, represented the police and the army respectively, so their state funding fell. 

Post-revolution, Romanian rugby union was still alive and kicking. In 1990 they recorded a prestigious win to date by beating France 12–6 on French soil for the first time. The following year they beat Scotland 18–12. At the 1991 World Cup they beat Fiji 17–15 and as recently as the 1995 World Cup, Romania held the eventual winners South Africa to a highly respectable 21–8.

The professionalism that followed immediately upon the heels of that World Cup was the undoing of the sport in Romania. Approximately 200 Romanian players are thought to be playing in France and Italy. It was not just playing numbers that suffered, but a whole generation of potential referees and administrators was lost to the game. By 1994 Romania&#x27;s rugby fortunes had declined sharply, when a Welsh team travelled to Bucharest for an uncapped international the visitors came away with a 16–9 win. In 1997 the Romanians toured Wales. They lost 36–21 to Wales A at Pontypridd and 70–21 in a test held in Wrexham. At the 1999 World Cup Romania could again only manage a single win 27–25 against the United States.

===The new millennium===

In 2000, Romania won the first European Nations Cup by a large margin, recording victories in all four matches. By 2001, Romania had been caught by the likes of Georgia who defeated them to take the 2001 European Nations Cup, crowned with a decisive 31–20 win over Romania in Bucharest. The national side lost to England by 134–0 in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151–0 to Saracens in the European Rugby Shield. Several French-based players refused to turn up for the England debacle simply because their clubs refused to pay them for the week. Players in that Romanian squad were getting £30 a day in expenses while England&#x27;s top earners scooped £6,000 for their afternoon&#x27;s work.

In January 2002, Bernard Charreyre was appointed coach of the national team both supplied by and paid by the French Rugby Federation (FFR). Under Charreyre (known by The Oaks as &#x27;Little Napoleon&#x27;), the Oaks&#x27; decline has been stopped and the team has started to slowly climb from the basement of international rugby union. With a change of format in the European Nations Cup, Romania started in 2002 trailing Georgia due to the inclusion of 2001 results. The Oaks won all of the remaining five games, including a hard-fought 31–23 victory in Tbilisi to win the tournament. They qualified for the World Cup in 2003, where they beat Namibia and lost to Ireland (45–17), after an honourable display, and then to Australia (90–8) and Argentina (50–3). Charreyre was dismissed after the World Cup as the Romanian Federation was not satisfied by the World Cup performance and decided not to renew his contract. Three other French coaches followed: first, Phillipe Sauton, for a very short period, Robert Antonin as a temporary stand-in and then Daniel Santamans.

In the 2003–2004 European Nations Cup, Portugal were surprise 16–15 winners over Romania in Lisbon and installed themselves on the top of the 2003 table. In the second half of the competition, Romania seemed back on track (36–6 against Portugal in Constanţa), but went down 24–33 to Russia in Krasnodar following allegations of players having been doped. Then Portugal clinched their first title with a last-minute 19–18 win over Russia in Lisbon. In 2004, the Romanians scored a narrow 25–24 victory over Italy, their first victory to date over a Six Nations Championship side.

In 2005 Romania was given &#x27;second tier&#x27; status by the IRB and replaced Russia in the Super Powers Cup. The USA beat a Romanian team stripped of their France-based players 23–16 in the third place play-off. The 2005–06 European Nations Cup also served as a qualifying group for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Romania triumphed despite finishing level on points with Georgia.

Romania qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, finishing at the top of their pool during the Round 5 of the European qualifying tournaments. Romania won their first qualifying match on 7 October, defeating Georgia in Bucharest 20–8. Their 43–20 win over Spain in Madrid on 14 October ensured that they qualified directly for the World Cup in 2007. In June 2007, Romania hosted the IRB Nations Cup in Bucuresti. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup finals, Romania won a bonus point in the 18–24 loss to Italy and to win a second game with Portugal by a narrow margin (14–10), but suffered heavy losses to Scotland (42–0) and New Zealand (85–8).

On 21 March 2009, Romania lost 22–21 at home to Portugal, leaving them with an uphill struggle to qualify for the 2011 World Cup – qualification for which is determined by performances in the European Nations Cup in 2009 and 2010. Romania went unbeaten, with a draw at Russia, in the 2010 phase of the European Nations Cup. The Oaks&#x27; strong finish put them in third place and the final phase of the European qualification playoffs, in which they easily defeated Ukraine over two legs (94–10 on aggregate) for the European place in the Final Place Playoff for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Romania emerged as the last qualifier for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand by overcoming first Tunisia in a winner-takes-it-all game (56–13) and later Uruguay (60–33 on aggregate). Thus, the Oaks are one of only 12 teams to participate at all World Cups alongside New Zealand, Australia, England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Argentina, Canada, and Japan.

In November 2016, Romania achieved home soil wins against the US, Canada and Uruguay.

In 2018, Romania finished top of the Rugby Europe Championship, meaning they qualified for the 2019 Rugby World Cup to be played in Japan in 2019. But after the conclusion of the tournament World Rugby conducted a review of player eligibility and found Romania fielded Sione Faka&#x27;osilea, who previously played for the Tonga Sevens team, which made him ineligible to play for Romania in the competition. Romania was stripped of 30 competition points, which placed them third and meant that they failed to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, with Russia taking their place.

On 29 May 2018, it was confirmed that Romania had appealed the decision. On 6 June, the appeal failed and the decision was upheld, meaning Russia was confirmed as Europe 1 and qualified for the World Cup, whilst Germany advanced to round 6.

===Notable players===
 

The 1924 Romania Olympic team are the only Romanian inductee to have been inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame. Nicolae Mărăscu captained the Hall of Fame side. The highest point of Mărăscu&#x27;s career was at the 1924 tournament, earning Romania the bronze medal. He played as a centre and had five caps, without ever scoring, since his first match, in 1919, a 48–5 loss to France, in Paris, for the Inter-Allied Games, and his last, at 22 May 1927, in a 21–5 win over Czechoslovakia, in Bratislava.

Iulian Dumitraș was Romania&#x27;s main man. Dumitraș was known to be one of the Oaks&#x27; most gifted playmakers, with an accurate kicking boot and a penchant for sparking attacks. Having made his test debut in 2002, he went on to start in every match a Rugby World Cup 2007 in France, bringing plenty of experience to the nation. The then standing 1.88m and weighing in a 110 kg, Dumitraș was a punishing runner when he chimes into the line on attack, which he looked to do often, and he provided a solid and dependable last obstacle in defence.

Sorin Socol is regarded by many good judges as the then best player in the current squad and was one of the rocks of the Romanian forward pack. He has captained the most matches to date for Romania, between 2003 and 2011. A total of 61 tests, 36 of them were as captain. He captained Romania for the first time on 30 October 2003 during the 2003 Rugby World Cup match against Namibia. He went on and featured in the 2007 World Cup squad and eventually retired from all international rugby after the 2011 tournament. Socol had one of Romania&#x27;s highest winning percentage as a captain of 63.88.

Florin Vlaicu is Romania&#x27;s top ever point scorer and also the most capped player appearing in 104 tests so far. Vlaicu made his international debut in 2006 as a substitute against Ukraine. He played for Romania in the IRB Nations Cup and in their 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying before appearing for them in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He played two Tests at the World Cup as a substitute against both Scotland and the All Blacks. He also played at the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cups.

Cristian Petre is Romania&#x27;s most recognized player after dominating the lock position for eleven years. He is one of Romania&#x27;s most capped player with a total of 92 matches and a career span that started in 2001 against England and ended in 2012 against Italy. Petre has featured in three Rugby World Cups, first in 2003, going on to feature in 2007 and his last being in 2011. Petre has scored a total of six tries and had winning percentage of 55.43.

Cătălin Fercu is generally regarded as one of Romania&#x27;s true global superstar of rugby union. Fercu is Romania&#x27;s top try scorers. He had quickly made appearances on the international stage at a very young age and played against France and Scotland in the Autumn internationals in 2006. He also scored a try against the French. Fercu helped guide Romania to the 2007 Rugby World Cup as he played in the qualifier matches including the vital games against Georgia and Spain and scored a try against Spain in the game that sealed their qualification to the Rugby World Cup. Fercu was a late withdrawal from their Rugby World Cup squad in 2011 because he was not prepared to fly all the way to New Zealand. The Romanian side arrived in Christchurch to prepare for their first game of the tournament against Scotland in Invercargill on 10 September without Fercu, who failed to get on the plane when it left Romania.

Another one of the Oaks greatest players are Romeo Gontineac, represented Romania in four Rugby World Cups from 1995 to 2007. The hard running centre, who became the national coach in 2010, was capped 75 times for the nation, scoring 13 tries and a drop goal. During his career he played professionally in Romania, South Africa and France.

==Kits and symbols==
Romania usually wears a yellow shirt with blue shorts and red socks as home uniform, with the exceptions being at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, where a light blue shirt with the Royal coat of arms was worn, as well in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where a blue uniform was worn in all of the matches. Since 2014, the jerseys are adorned with Romanian traditional embroidering motifs and Dacian patterns.

The origins of the oak leaf as symbol for the Romanian team date from 1979, after former Romanian international player Viorel Morariu and then-president of Federația Română de Rugby, decided, with the consultation of specialists, that an oak leaf would be the team emblem (as during the touris in the British Isles and Ireland, the Communist coat of arms painted on the Romanian players&#x27; shirts became unrecognisable due to the rain). The Latin word for oak, &quot;robur&quot;, also meant &quot;strength&quot; in that same language. In 1980, a new badge, a shield with an oak leaf (which made the Romanian team be nicknamed &quot;Stejarii&quot;, which means &quot;the oaks&quot;) and the acronym &quot;FRR&quot; on the top. The adoption of said emblem could be also seen as an act of defiance towards the then-ruling regime in Romania, whose approval was given to the Romanian federations&#x27;s requests to be affiliated to the IRFB. After the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the oak leaf was seen without the shield, usually accompanied by the inscription &quot;Rugby Romania&quot;.

<text>A drone is a male bee. Unlike the female worker bee, a drone has no stinger. He does not gather nectar or pollen and cannot feed without assistance from worker bees. His only role is to mate with a maiden queen in nuptial flight.

==Genetics==
Drones carry only one type of allele at each chromosomal position, because they are haploid (containing only one set of chromosomes from the mother). During the development of eggs within a queen, a diploid cell with 32 chromosomes divides to generate haploid cells called gametes with 16 chromosomes. The result is a haploid egg, with chromosomes having a new combination of alleles at the various loci. This process is called arrhenotokous parthenogenesis or simply arrhenotoky.

Because the male bee technically has only a mother, and no father, its genealogical tree is unusual. The first generation has one member (the male). One generation back also has one member (the mother). Two generations back are two members (the mother and father of the mother). Three generations back are three members. Four back are five members. This sequence – 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on – is the Fibonacci sequence.

Much debate and controversy exists in scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the haplodiploid sex-determination system. The drones have two reproductive functions: each drone grows from the queen&#x27;s unfertilized haploid egg and produces some 10 million male sperm cells, each genetically identical to the egg. Drones also serve as a vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female worker bees develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16 chromosomes for a total of 32: one set from each parent. Since all the sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.

A laying worker bee exclusively produces totally unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones. As an exception to this rule, laying worker bees in some subspecies of honey bees may also produce diploid (and therefore female) fertile offspring in a process called thelytoky, in which the second set of chromosomes comes not from sperm, but from one of the three polar bodies during anaphase II of meiosis.

In honey bees, the genetics of offspring can best be controlled by artificially inseminating (referred to in beekeeping as &quot;instrumental insemination&quot;) a queen with drones collected from a single hive, where the drones&#x27; mother is known. In the natural mating process, a queen mates with multiple drones, which may not come from the same hive. Therefore, batches of female offspring have fathers of a completely different genetic origin.

==Anatomy==
A drone is characterized by eyes that are twice the size of those of worker bees and queens, and a body size greater than that of worker bees, though usually smaller than the queen bee. His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight. The average flight time for a drone is about 20 minutes.

An &quot;Apis cerana&quot; colony has about 200 drones during high summer peak time.
Drones depend on worker bees to feed them.

Drones die off or are ejected from the hive by the worker bees in late autumn, dying from exposure and the inability to protect or feed themselves, and do not reappear in the bee hive until late spring. The worker bees evict them as the drones would deplete the hive&#x27;s resources too quickly if they were allowed to stay.

==Role==
The drones&#x27; main function is to be ready to fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a virgin queen of the same hive because the queen flies further to a drone congregation area than the drones do. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is not understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen of the same hive, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous empty cells on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker). The worker bees remove the inbred brood and consume it to recycle the protein.

Mating occurs in flight, which accounts for drones needing better vision, which is provided by their large eyes. Should a drone succeed in mating, the first thing that happens is all of the blood in the drone&#x27;s body rushes to his endophallus, which causes him to lose control over his entire body. His body falls away, leaving a portion of his endophallus attached to the queen which helps guide the next drone in the queen.

Honey bee queen breeders may breed drones to be used for instrumental insemination or open mating. A queen mating yard must have many drones to be successful.

In areas with severe winters, all drones are driven out of the hive in the autumn. A colony begins to rear drones in spring and drone population reaches its peak coinciding with the swarm season in late spring and early summer. The life expectancy of a drone is about 90 days.

Although the drone is highly specialized to perform one function, mating and continuing the propagation of the hive, they may have other purposes. All bees, when they sense the hive&#x27;s temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wings—behaviours which drones share with worker bees.

==Behavior==
Drones do not exhibit typical worker bee behaviors such as nectar and pollen gathering, nursing, or hive construction. While drones are unable to sting, if picked up, they may swing their tails in an attempt to frighten the disturber. In some species, drones buzz around intruders in an attempt to disorient them if the nest is disturbed.

Drones fly in abundance in the early afternoon and are known to congregate in drone congregation areas a good distance away from the hive.

==Mating and the drone reproductive organ==
The drone endophallus is optimized to disperse a large quantity of seminal fluid and spermatozoa with great speed and force. The endophallus is held internally in the drone. During mating, the organ is everted (turned inside out), into the queen. The eversion of the endophallus is achieved by contracting abdominal muscles, which increases hemolymph pressure, effectively &quot;inflating&quot; the endophallus. Cornua claspers at the base of the endophallus help to grip the queen.

Mating between a single drone and the queen lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often completed within 1–2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and above ground. Since the queen mates with 5–⁠19 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must make the most of his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen&#x27;s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. The process of ejaculation is explosive—semen is blasted through the queen&#x27;s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a &quot;popping&quot; sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during mating—so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover endophallus remaining in the queen&#x27;s oviduct is referred to as the &quot;mating sign&quot;. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the oviduct.

==Drone congregation areas==
Mating between the drones and a virgin queen takes place away from the colony, in mid-air mating sites. These mating sites, called &quot;congregation areas&quot;, are specific locations, where drones wait for the arrival of virgin queens. A congregation area is typically above ground, and can have a diameter of . The boundaries of a congregation area are distinct; queens flying a few meters outside the boundaries are mostly ignored by the drones. Congregation areas are typically used year after year, with some spots showing little change over 12 years. Since drones are expelled from a colony during the winter, and new drones are raised each spring, inexperienced drones must find these congregation areas anew. This suggests some environmental cues define a congregation area, although the actual cues are unknown.

Congregation areas are typically located above open ground, away from trees or hills, where flight is somewhat protected from the wind (calm winds may be helpful during mating flight). At the same time, many congregation areas do not show such characteristics, such as those located above water or the forest canopy. Some studies have suggested that magnetic orientation could play a role, since drones older than 6 days contain cells in the abdomen that are rich in magnetite.

Congregation areas can be located by attaching a virgin queen (in a cage) to a balloon floating above ground. The person then moves around, taking note of where drones are attracted to the caged queen. Congregation areas are not found closer than from an apiary, and congregation areas located farther away from apiaries receive more drones. In a congregation area, drones accumulate from as many as 200 colonies, with estimates of up to 25,000 individual drones. This broad mixing of drones is how a virgin queen can ensure she will receive the genetic diversity needed for her colony. By flying to congregation areas further away from her colony, she further increases the probability of out-breeding.

A single drone visits multiple congregation areas during his lifetime, often taking multiple trips per afternoon. A drone&#x27;s mating flight averages 20–25 minutes, before he must return to the colony to refuel with honey. While at the site, the drones fly around passively, waiting for the arrival of a virgin. When the virgin queen arrives to the congregation area, the drones locate her by visual and olfactory cues. At this point, it is a race to mate with the virgin queen, to be genetically represented in the newly founded colony. The swarming drones, as they actively follow the queen, reportedly resemble a &quot;drone comet&quot;, dissolving and reforming as the drones chase the virgin queen. Drones greatly outnumber the quantity of virgin queens produced per season, so even with multiple mating by the queen, very few drones mate successfully (estimated at less than one in 1,000). If needed, a virgin queen can embark on multiple &quot;nuptial flights&quot;, to be sure to receive enough semen from enough drones.

==&quot;Varroa destructor&quot;==
&quot;Varroa destructor&quot;, a parasitic mite, propagates within the brood cell of bees. The &quot;Varroa&quot; mite prefers drone brood as it guarantees a longer development period, which is important for its own propagation success. The number of &quot;Varroa&quot; mites can be kept in check by removing the capped drone brood and either freezing the brood comb or heating it.

<text>In music, a drone is a harmonic or monophonic effect or accompaniment where a note or chord is continuously sounded throughout most or all of a piece. A drone may also be any part of a musical instrument used to produce this effect; an archaic term for this is burden (bourdon or burdon) such as a &quot;drone [pipe] of a bagpipe&quot;, the pedal point in an organ, or the lowest course of a lute. Α &quot;burden&quot; is also part of a song that is repeated at the end of each stanza, such as the chorus or refrain.

==Musical effect==
&quot;Of all harmonic devices, it [a drone] is not only the simplest, but probably also the most fertile.&quot;

A drone effect can be achieved through a sustained sound or through repetition of a note. It most often establishes a tonality upon which the rest of the piece is built. A drone can be instrumental, vocal or both. Drone (both instrumental and vocal) can be placed in different ranges of the polyphonic texture: in the lowest part, in the highest part, or in the middle. The drone is most often placed upon the tonic or dominant (play &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot; with a drone on the , on the , or on . Compare with .). A drone on the same pitch as a melodic note tends to both hide that note and to bring attention to it by increasing its importance.

A drone differs from a pedal tone or point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a form of nonchord tone and thus required to resolve unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be considered a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.

==History and distribution==

The systematic use of drones originated in instrumental music of ancient Southwest Asia, and spread north and west to Europe and south to Africa. It is used in Indian music and is played with the tanpura (or tambura) and other Indian drone instruments like the ottu, the ektar, the dotara (or dotar; dutar in Persian Central Asia), the surpeti, the surmandal (or swarmandal) and the shankh (conch shell). Most of the types of bagpipes that exist worldwide have up to three drones, making this one of the first instruments that comes to mind when speaking of drone music. In America, most forms of the African-influenced banjo contain a drone string. Since the 1960s, the drone has become a prominent feature in drone music and other forms of avant-garde music.

In vocal music drone is particularly widespread in traditional musical cultures, particularly in Europe, Polynesia and Melanesia. It is also present in some isolated regions of Asia (like among Pearl-divers in the Persian Gulf, some national minorities of South-West China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Afghanistan).

==Part(s) of a musical instrument==
&quot;Drone&quot; is also the term for the part of a musical instrument intended to produce the drone effect&#x27;s sustained pitch, generally without the ongoing attention of the player. Different melodic Indian instruments (e.g. the sitar, the sarod, the sarangi and the rudra veena) contain a drone. For example, the sitar features three or four resonating drone strings, and Indian notes (sargam) are practiced to a drone. Bagpipes (like the Great Highland Bagpipe and the Zampogna) feature a number of drone pipes, giving the instruments their characteristic sounds. A hurdy-gurdy has one or more drone strings. The fifth string on a five-string banjo is a drone string with a separate tuning peg that places the end of the string five frets down the neck of the instrument; this string is usually tuned to the same note as that which the first string produces when played at the fifth fret. The bass strings of the Slovenian drone zither also freely resonate as a drone. The Welsh Crwth also features two drone strings.

== Use in musical compositions ==
Composers of Western classical music occasionally used a drone (especially one on open fifths) to evoke a rustic or archaic atmosphere, perhaps echoing that of Scottish or other early or folk music. Examples include the following:

* Haydn, Symphony No. 104, &quot;London&quot;, opening of finale, accompanying a folk melody.
* Beethoven, Symphony No. 6, &quot;Pastoral&quot;, opening and trio section of scherzo.
* Mendelssohn, Symphony No. 3 in A minor, opus 56, &#x27;Scottish&#x27;, especially the finale.
* Berlioz, Harold in Italy, accompanying oboes as they imitate the piffero of Italian peasants
* Richard Strauss, Also sprach Zarathustra, Introduction: the opening grows out of a drone effect in the orchestra. 
* Mahler, Symphony No. 1, introduction; a seven-octave drone on A evokes &quot;the awakening of nature at the earliest dawn&quot;.
* Bartók, in his adaptations for piano of Hungarian and other folk music.

The best-known drone piece in the concert repertory is the Prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (1854) wherein low horns and bass instruments sustain an E throughout the entire movement. The atmospheric ostinato effect that opens Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, which inspired similar gestures in the opening of all the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, represents a gesture derivative of drones. 

One consideration for composers of common practice keyboard music was equal temperament. The adjustments lead to slight mistunings as heard against a sustained drone. Even so, drones have often been used to spotlight dissonance purposefully. 

Modern concert musicians make frequent use of drones, often with just or other non-equal tempered tunings. Drones are a regular feature in the music of composers indebted to the chant tradition, such as Arvo Pärt, Sofia Gubaidulina, and John Tavener. The single-tones that provided the impetus for minimalism through the music of La Monte Young and many of his students qualify as drones. David First, the band Coil, the early experimental compilations of John Cale (&quot;Sun Blindness Music&quot;, Dream Interpretation, and &quot;Stainless Gamelan&quot;), Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster, Alvin Lucier (&quot;Music On A Long Thin Wire&quot;), Ellen Fullman, Lawrence Chandler and Arnold Dreyblatt all make notable use of drones. The music of Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi is essentially drone-based. Shorter drones or the general concept of a continuous element are often used by many other composers. Other composers whose music is entirely based on drones include Charlemagne Palestine and Phill Niblock. &quot;The Immovable Do&quot; by Percy Grainger contains a sustained high C (heard in the upper woodwinds) that lasts for the entirety of the piece. Drone pieces also include Loren Rush&#x27;s &quot;Hard Music&quot; (1970) and Folke Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Was??&quot; (1968), as well as Robert Erickson&#x27;s &quot;Down at Piraeus&quot;. The avant-garde guitarist Glenn Branca also used drones extensively. French singer Camille uses a continuous B throughout her album &quot;Le Fil&quot;.

Drones continue to be characteristic of folk music. Early songs by Bob Dylan employ the effect with a retuned guitar in &quot;Masters of War&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The song &quot;You Will Be My Ain True Love&quot;, written by Sting for the 2003 movie &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; and performed by Alison Krauss and Sting, uses drone bass.

Drones are used widely in the blues and blues-derived genres. Jerry Lee Lewis featured drones in solos and fills. Drones were virtually absent in original rock and roll music, but gained popularity after the Beatles used drones in a few popular compositions (for example, &quot;Blackbird&quot; has a drone in the middle of a texture throughout the whole song, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; makes use of tambura). They also used high drone for the dramatic effect in some sections of several of their compositions (like the last verses of &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;). Rock band U2 uses drones in their compositions particularly widely. In the Led Zeppelin song &quot;In The Light&quot;, a keyboard drone is used throughout the song, mostly in the intro.

American musician Roy Ayers used this technique in most of his repertoire. Examples being &quot;Everybody Loves the Sunshine&quot; (1976) and Searching (1976)) which have a high sustained synth string note through most of their duration.

Afrocentric acts influenced by Ayers like acid jazz or neo soul tend to use this technique very often. compositions like Erykah Badu&#x27;s &quot;Otherside of the Game&quot;, Slum Village&#x27;s &quot;Untitled/Fantastic&quot; or Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot; (in a lower extent for that case) use a synthesized or acoustic high sustained string.
Scott Walker - &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Today&quot; from 1969&#x27;s SCOTT 3 Uses a drone and this song was used in Tv. Shows as a hunting effect.

== Use for musical training ==
Drones are used by a number of music education programs for ear training and pitch awareness, as well as a way to improvise ensemble music. A shruti box is often used by vocalists in this style of musical training. Drones, owing to their acoustic properties and following their longstanding use in ritual and chant, can be useful in constructing aural structures outside common practice expectations of harmony and melody.

<text>Above is the only studio album by the American rock band Mad Season, released on March 14, 1995, through Columbia Records. &quot;Above&quot; peaked at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States. The band&#x27;s singer Layne Staley created the artwork on the album cover and inside the inlay.

==Background==
During the production of Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he met John Baker Saunders, who would a short while later become bassist in The Walkabouts. In 1994, when the two returned to Seattle, they formed a side band with Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin. Immediately the trio set up rehearsal time together and began writing material. McCready then brought in friend and Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley to round out the line-up. McCready had hoped that being around sober musicians would push Staley to get himself sober.

==Recording==
The album was recorded in 1994 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington. Producer and mixer Brett Eliason previously worked with McCready as Pearl Jam&#x27;s sound engineer.

The music for &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;River of Deceit&quot; came from group rehearsals before Staley joined. &quot;Artificial Red&quot; came together at the band&#x27;s show at the Crocodile Cafe in October 1994. &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot; were premiered on Pearl Jam&#x27;s January 8, 1995 &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; satellite radio show – a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast from Seattle that was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it. 

&quot;We did all the Mad Season music in about seven days,&quot; McCready said. &quot;It took Layne just a few more days to finish his vocals, which was intense since we only rehearsed twice and did four shows. So this has been the most spontaneous thing I&#x27;ve ever been involved in. This was done even quicker than &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot;, which took about four weeks… With Mad Season we just went in and started jamming on tunes and everybody had ideas and it just happened with three or four days.&quot;

McCready said, &quot;I told [Staley]… &#x27;You do what you want, you write all the songs and lyrics. You&#x27;re the singer.&#x27; He&#x27;d come in, and he&#x27;d do these beautiful songs.&quot; 

During the making of the album, Staley read &quot;The Prophet&quot; by Kahlil Gibran. &quot;Layne Staley felt as though he was on a spiritual mission through his music,&quot; said Martin. &quot;Not a rock mission, a spiritual mission.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album &quot;sounds like a cross between Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam, taking the ponderous seriousness of Alice and PJ&#x27;s &#x27;90s update of winding &#x27;70s guitar rock.&quot; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot;&#x27;s verse bar features a droning, overdriven guitar melody centered on the use of harmonics. &quot;Long Gone Day&quot; takes influence from genres as diverse as jazz, psychedelic rock, classic rock, and blues. Saxophonist Skerik contributes to the song.

Staley is credited for writing all the lyrics on the original release within the liner notes of the 2013 deluxe issue. As was the case with much of his work with Alice in Chains, Staley&#x27;s lyrics dealt with his struggle against addiction as well as other personal troubles. Lyrically, much of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; was inspired by Khalil Gibran&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Vocalist Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees contributes guest vocals on &quot;I&#x27;m Above&quot; and &quot;Long Gone Day&quot;; he is also credited for co-writing the music to those tracks along with McCready and Martin. Lanegan also wrote the lyrics for the three bonus tracks on disc 1 of the deluxe issue - &quot;Locomotive&quot;, &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot;, and &quot;Slip Away&quot;. R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck is credited for co-writing the music to &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot; along with McCready, Martin, Saunders, and Lanegan.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Above&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics and was very well received by grunge fans, but some critics pointed out the album&#x27;s flaws. Despite some negative criticism, the album was a moderate commercial success. Over the course of 1995, &quot;Above&quot; scaled the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart eventually peaking at number 24. &quot;Above&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; called the album &quot;a Country Sabbath combination&quot; and &quot;a refreshing holiday from the pressures of corporate ultra-stardom.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that &quot;the album meanders without much direction, yet there are flashes of invention, particularly in Staley&#x27;s work, with McCready contributing a few tasty licks.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Barbara Davies gave &quot;Above&quot; two and a half out of five stars but was later changed to a more positive three out of five stars, saying that Mad Season &quot;take artistic risks and set out to make something fresh on &quot;Above&quot;.&quot; However, she criticized the album for having a &quot;hit-or-miss quality.&quot; Davies ended the review by stating that &quot;the band is—at times—more than the mere sum of its parts.&quot; Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C. He said, &quot;A sax solo and zooming guitars provide momentary relief, but most Mad Season sludge is unbearably immobile.&quot; He ended by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s big trouble when one of the most upbeat songs is called &#x27;Lifeless Dead&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Above&quot; included the singles &quot;River of Deceit&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot;, and &quot;Long Gone Day&quot;. The lead single &quot;River of Deceit&quot; had an accompanying music video, while other music videos were taken from performances from the band&#x27;s home video release, &quot;Live at The Moore&quot;. &quot;River of Deceit&quot; was the most successful song from &quot;Above&quot; on the rock charts, reaching number two on the Mainstream Rock charts and number nine on the Modern Rock charts. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot; also charted on the Mainstream Rock charts. &quot;River of Deceit&quot; is arguably the group&#x27;s best known song while &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot; still maintains modest radio play today.

===Rerelease===
In October 2012, drummer Barrett Martin announced a Mad Season box set would be released on March 12, 2013, nearly 18 years to the day after the release of &quot;Above&quot;. The release date was later pushed back to April 2, 2013. Martin said that

On January 7, 2013, Blabbermouth.net reported that Legacy Recordings would release an expanded deluxe edition of &quot;Above&quot;, a three-disc boxset comprising two CDs and one DVD. It includes the original studio album and a host of extras, specifically some unreleased tracks from the band&#x27;s unfinished second album with lyrics and vocals by Mark Lanegan; the full audio set of the band&#x27;s &quot;Live at The Moore&quot; performance on April 29, 1995; and the first official DVD release of &quot;Live at The Moore&quot;, including a previously unreleased full concert video of the band&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve performance from the now-defunct Seattle club RKCNDY.

In April 2019, &quot;Above&quot; was ranked No. 18 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s gloomy, black and white cover art featuring a couple tongue-kissing was illustrated by Staley. The drawing was based upon a photograph of Staley and his ex-fiancée, Demri Lara Parrott. The album&#x27;s title comes from the song &quot;I&#x27;m Above&quot;.

==Track listing==
All lyrics by Layne Staley, except where noted. All music by Mad Season, except where noted.


===DVD: &quot;Live at The Moore&quot; plus bonus footage===

==Outtakes==
A promotional version of &quot;Above&quot; has a bonus track entitled &quot;Interlude&quot;, an instrumental piece by McCready which was also sometimes played live by Pearl Jam, labelled as &quot;Going Home (improv)&quot;, which follows &quot;Artificial Red&quot;. Mad Season&#x27;s cover of the John Lennon song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; was also recorded around this time. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; appeared on the 1995 John Lennon tribute album, &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;.

<doc id="979072" wikidata="Q559349" url="?curid=979072" title="Edgar Winter">
<text>Edgar Holland Winter (born December 28, 1946) is an American multi-instrumentalist, working as a vocalist along with playing keyboards, saxophone, and percussion. His success peaked in the 1970s with his band the Edgar Winter Group and their popular songs &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Free Ride&quot;. He is the brother of late blues singer and guitarist Johnny Winter.

==Early life==
Winter was born to John Winter II and Edwina Winter on December 28, 1946, in Beaumont, Texas. Both he and his elder brother Johnny were born with albinism. By the time he left the family home, Winter had mastered numerous instruments and reading and writing music.

==Career==

Winter composed and performed songs of numerous genres, including rock, jazz, blues, and pop. His critically acclaimed 1970 debut release, &quot;Entrance&quot;, was first to demonstrate his unique style of genre-blending musicianship. His early recording of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; gained attention. Edgar followed &quot;Entrance&quot; with two hit albums backed by his group White Trash, a group originally composed of musicians from Texas and Louisiana. White Trash, with Winter and Jerry Lacroix both on lead vocals and sax, released the studio album &quot;Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash&quot;, in 1971. It reached #111 on the charts, and 1972&#x27;s follow-up album (partially recorded at New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater) &quot;Roadwork&quot; achieved gold status.

In late 1972, Winter brought together Dan Hartman, Ronnie Montrose and Chuck Ruff to form The Edgar Winter Group, who created such hits as the number one &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Free Ride&quot; (with lead vocals by its writer Hartman). Released in November 1972, &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot;, peaked at the number 3 position on the Billboard Hot 200 and stayed on the charts for 80 weeks. It was certified gold in April 1973 by the RIAA, and double platinum in November 1986.

Winter invented the keyboard body strap early in his career, an innovation that allows him the freedom to move around on stage during his multi-instrument high-energy performances.

After &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot;, Winter released &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, featuring guitarist Rick Derringer in place of Ronnie Montrose. That album contained Winter&#x27;s third and final Top 40 single &quot;River&#x27;s Risin, again sung by Hartman. Later albums included &quot;Jasmine Nightdreams&quot;, &quot;The Edgar Winter Group with Rick Derringer&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Recycled&quot;, a reunion with White Trash, &quot;Standing on Rock&quot;, &quot;Mission Earth&quot;, &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, &quot;Not a Kid Anymore&quot;, &quot;The Real Deal&quot;, &quot;Winter Blues&quot; and &quot;Rebel Road.&quot;

Winter also kept busy doing session work, playing saxophone on Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;All Revved Up with No Place to Go&quot;, Dan Hartman&#x27;s solo hit &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Simply the Best&quot; and David Lee Roth&#x27;s remake of &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;, as well as appearing on material by Rick Derringer, Johnny Winter, Ronnie Montrose, Todd Rundgren, Michael McDonald and many others.

Major national television and radio campaigns have used Winter&#x27;s music to advertise their products. Winter has also made frequent television appearances, both to promote his music and to give his opinions, on shows such as &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;. Winter also starred with George Hamilton in a commercial for Miller Lite beer. He appeared in the film &quot;Netherworld&quot; and the TV shows &quot;The Cape&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

Winter&#x27;s music has been used in many film and television projects, including &quot;Netherworld&quot;, &quot;Air America&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, &quot;Encino Man&quot;, &quot;Son in Law&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, &quot;Starkid&quot;, &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, &quot;Knockabout Guys&quot;, &quot;Duets&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. &quot;&quot;, a biography of rapper Tupac Shakur, produced and co-written by Eminem, sampled Winter&#x27;s song &quot;Dying to Live&quot; as &quot;Runnin&#x27; (Dying to Live),&quot; incorporating vocals by the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac, and Winter himself. &quot;Runnin peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Singles Sales chart and the soundtrack was #1 for 8 consecutive weeks. Blues performer Jonny Lang also covered &quot;Dying to Live&quot; around this time. Winter performed the song solo at the piano on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

Winter&#x27;s 2003 CD and DVD titled &quot;Live at the Galaxy&quot; was recorded live at the Galaxy Theatre for Classic Pictures. It features the songs, &quot;Keep Playing That Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot;, &quot;Free Ride&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Show Your Love&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. In addition, the DVD includes a 30-minute documentary, &quot;Edgar Winter: The Man and His Music&quot;.

Winter also played with Ringo Starr in the ninth (2006), tenth (2008), eleventh (2010-2011) and fifteenth (2022-) iterations of his All-Starr Band. The band&#x27;s 2010–11 tour featured the reunion of Winter and Rick Derringer. From August to early-September 2017, The Edgar Winter Band toured as the opening act for both Deep Purple and Alice Cooper as they performed several North American tour dates as part of The Long Goodbye Tour.

In 2017, Cherry Red released a four-CD remastered compilation of all of the Edgar Winter solo albums from 1970 until 1980, entitled &quot;Tell Me in a Whisper: The Solo Albums 1970 - 1980&quot;. In 2018, Cherry Red also released a remastered six-CD compilation of the Edgar Winter: White Trash Band and the Edgar Winter Band albums entitled &quot;I&#x27;ve Got News for You: Featuring the Edgar Winter Group &amp; Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash 1971 - 1977&quot;.

===&quot;Mission Earth&quot;===
Winter also produced, arranged, and performed on the 1986 album &quot;Mission Earth&quot;. This album&#x27;s lyrics and music were written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard is said to have left detailed instructions and audio tapes for the musicians and producers to follow when making the album. Winter described &quot;Mission Earth&quot; as &quot;both a return to rock&#x27;s primal roots and yet highly experimental.&quot; Winter wrote, &quot;Ron&#x27;s technical insight of the recording process was outstanding.&quot; Winter also described Hubbard&#x27;s delineation of counter-rhythm in rock as something &quot;which was nothing short of phenomenal, particularly in as much as it had then been entirely unexplored and only later heard in the African-based rhythms of Paul Simon&#x27;s work, some five years after Ron&#x27;s analysis.&quot;

==Personal life==
Winter and his wife, Monique, live in Beverly Hills, California. The couple have no children. Winter stated in an interview: &quot;I can see how that would be a wonderful rewarding thing, but I think there are enough people in the world&quot; and that &quot;it might have been more problematical if I had children with a career and all of it. I tour all the time. If I were to have children, I would want to be home all the time.&quot;

<doc id="979084" wikidata="Q2915916" url="?curid=979084" title="National Intelligence Agency (South Africa)">
<text>The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) was the previous name of an intelligence agency of the South African government. Currently it is known as the Domestic Branch of the State Security Agency. It is responsible for domestic and counter-intelligence within the Republic of South Africa. The branch is run by a Director, who reports to the Director-General of the State Security Agency. The Director is also a member of the National Intelligence Co-Ordinating Committee (NICOC).

==Origins==
The NIA was formed in 1994, the same year South Africa&#x27;s first multi-racial elections were held. It was created to take over from the domestic intelligence segment of the then National Intelligence Service (NIS) with the foreign intelligence functions being taken over by the South African Secret Service (SASS). Both the SASS and NIA were created as part of the Intelligence Act of 1994. They were created out of the six intelligence organisations consisted of the NIS, Department of Intelligence and Security (ANC), Pan African Security Service (PAC), and the three intelligence services of Venda, Transkei and Bophuthatswana. These two new organisations would consist of a total of 4000 people with 2130 from the NIS, 910 from DIS (ANC), 304 from Bophuthatswana Intelligence and Internal Security Service (BISS), 233 from Transkei Intelligence Service (TIS), 76 from Venda National Intelligence Service (VNIS) and the rest from the PASS (PAC).

==Function and mandate==
The National Strategic Intelligence Act of 1994 defines the primary functions of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) as being to gather, correlate, evaluate and analyse domestic intelligence to:

* identify any threat or potential threat to the security of the Republic or its people
* supply intelligence regarding any such threat to the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee (NICOC)
* gather departmental intelligence at the request of any interested department of state and without delay to transmit such intelligence that constitutes departmental intelligence to the relevant department
* fulfil the national counter-intelligence responsibility and for this purpose to conduct and coordinate counter-intelligence to gather, correlate, evaluate, analyse and interpret information regarding counter-intelligence to identify any threat or potential threat to the security of the Republic or its people
* inform the President of any such threat
* supply (where necessary) intelligence relating to any such threat to the South African Police Services (SAPS) for the purposes of investigating any offence or alleged offence.

In view of these functions, NIA (the Domestic Branch) is responsible for the following:

* To fulfil a proactive, anticipatory or early warning role of scanning and assessing the total (economic, social, political and environmental) domestic security situation to identify and report to the policy maker or executive departments any signs or warning signals of threats or potential threats to the constitutional order and the safety of the people
* To perform a reactive monitoring role of tracking events when a threat/crime has been identified or a crisis has already arisen, without duplication of the role of the other executive departments. The purpose of this monitoring role is mainly to enhance investigation and prosecution by providing tactical information and intelligence to enforcement and prosecution institutions and to decide the extent and the implications of threats or potential threats to the national security of the Republic and the safety of the people
* To provide an integrated multi-analytical strategic projective assessment of patterns, trends and of security relevant issues, to provide strategic early warning and to enhance NIA&#x27;s support/involvement in policy formulation.

==Directors-General/Directors==
The following people have held the position of Director-General or Director since the restructure of the South African intelligence services in 1994:
* 1995–1999: Sizakele Sigxashe
* 1999–2004: Vusi Mavimbela
* 2004–2005: Billy Masetlha
* 2005–2009: Manala Manzini
* 2009–2011: Lizo Gibson Njenje
* 2011–2013: ?????
* 2013–2014: Simon Ntombela
* 2015–2017: Bheki WJ Langa
* 2017-2019: Bob Mhlanga 
* 2019-2021: Mahlodi Sam Muofhe

== Organisational structure ==
The Domestic Branch&#x27;s organisational structure is largely unknown but sources have mentioned the following departments or sections:

* Counter-intelligence
* Domestic collection
* Security

In 1999, the agency employed about 1,500 persons.

== Past names ==
Although commonly referred to as the NIA, the organization has undergone a name change:

* 1 January 1995: National Intelligence Service
* 2 October 2005: Domestic Branch - State Security Agency

==History==
The history of the NIA has been recorded by the South African media, mostly in the cases were operations have gone wrong or have been leaked, but with all intelligence organisations, their successes remain mostly as state secrets:

===Sizakele Sigxashe===
Formerly an intelligence officer in Umkhonto we Sizwe, Sizakele Sigxashe was appointed the first director-general of the NIA on 1 January 1995. His task was to unify a new organization made up of members of many of the pre-1994 intelligence agencies each with its own culture and work techniques.

On 2 October 1995, Muziwendoda Mdluli, NIA chief of security, was found dead in his car in Pretoria from a gunshot wound to his head that would shock the organisation. A pathologist at the inquest would later claim that the suicide shooting was unusual as the victim had shot himself in the forehead and not the right temple. From the documents left at home he may have been investigating apartheid police hit-squads and gun-running to Rwanda. The police investigation went nowhere and an unhappy NIA conducted its own investigation of possible third force involvement with claims later that it had conducted wiretap surveillance on Police Commissioner George Fivaz and other senior policemen further degrading the relationship.

Sigxashe found himself in the news in October 1995 when police were called to his home after it was claimed that he had drawn a pistol on his wife and family. The NIA denied the pistol claim and later said that the police had leaked the allegation to the press resulting in tension between the two organisations.

In 1997, during its move to a new office, centralizing many offices under a single headquarters, it had vehicles and computer equipment stolen with the thieves never found nor brought to justice. In January 1997, the NIA had been instructed by Deputy Intelligence Minister Joe Nhlanhla to do an audit of its service files to determine if any were missing and whether any current personnel were in possession of files or if they had been destroyed as these may be required by Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).

===Vusi Mavimbela===
Vusi Mavimbela was appointed as the new Director-General of the NIA on 20 October 1999 replacing Sizakele Sigxashe. Prior to 1994, he was a member of the ANC&#x27;s Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS) and previously to the new appointment, was Deputy Director-General of the NIA from 1995 to 1997. In his opening address to his new organization, he highlight his aims which included strengthening the NIA deficiencies when it came to discipline and accountability in its corporate culture. Joe Nhlanhla, Minister of Intelligence Services, would also say at the same time that the NIA needed to accelerated its transformation into an institution whose personnel reflect the demographic profile of the country as a whole, united by a commitment to the new, non-racial South Africa and attain &quot;full representativity &quot; in gender, disability and race.

A NIA spokesperson, in November 1999, responded to claims by the Democratic Alliance (DA) of the bugging of their Western Province offices from an adjacent Government building saying there was no reason for surveillance of the organisation, despite the DA ever alleging it was the NIA. During the same month, a Ministry of Intelligence spokesperson said an investigation was under way to investigate claims made in a South African paper, that the NIA were running a counter-intelligence operation against the German Embassy since 1995 after it was claimed the latter was attempting to recruit South African citizens. The paper also claimed that the NIA had attempted to recruit German Embassy workers to establish the reasons for the Germans security services effort and had established a surveillance operation from a house opposite the embassy. On 18 November 1999, a covert security camera had been found in a waste bin opposite the German Embassy which officials would claim was part of an anti-crime operation and not the monitoring of visitors to the building.

In October 1998, police would arrest two members of the NIA after they attempted to cash stolen share certificates worth more than R180 million and the two were also linked to a financial brokerage which had accepted three illegal promissory notes from the Mpumalanga Parks Board, which had been used to secure a R340 million offshore loan. It was said the two members of the NIA had been laundering money through the brokerage and had claimed it was part of a NIA operation to against foreign exchange control violations. When the certificates were cashed by the brokerage in January 1999, the buyer, BFS Capital, established they were stolen and two brokerage members arrested. The two brokerage members later have the charges dropped would later have the charges dropped against them but the brokerage was closed down by the Reserve Bank, but one member would later be arrested in the United States for extradition to Switzerland for fraud. The two NIA members said they would disclose their handlers involvement in court in June 2000, though the handler insisted to the police that the two NIA members had gone beyond their mandate and pocketed profits from the operation. The NIA handler and his unit would later be suspended based on allegations of fraud, misuse of state resources and death threats.

NIA was also involved with the vetting of members of parliament&#x27;s Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, who would then appoint the Inspector-General of Intelligence. The Democratic Partys nominee was rejected, having been an old member of the ANC and its intelligence operations prior to 1994 though it was claimed that this not the reason for his rejection.

In early 2000, NIA was accused by Pagad&#x27;s leader, Abdus Salaam Ebrahim, of being involved in a bombing at the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront in the previous years and the murders and attempted murder of its members. Pagad had led a vigilante campaign against crime and drugs in the Western Cape since 1995. The police dismissed the allegations as false but it appeared that the NIA had infiltrated the organisation.

During April 2000, the NIA and SASS became embroiled in an international fraud that had been initiated by a now former member of the NIA whom had used a series of apartheid-era front companies, created before 1994. The scam, having been discovered, resulted in a group American investors successfully suing the South African government in an American court for $14 million (R94 million). The front companies had been set up in the late 80s by a number of former apartheid South African intelligence officials including Eugene de Kock.

The Scorpions had failed to act on intelligence supplied when in September 2000, the NIA had provide information that Pagad was planning to assassinate a judicial official. Later that month, Cape Town magistrate, Pieter Theron was assassinated outside his house.

At the end of 2004, Mavimbela&#x27;s appointment ended and he left the public sector for the private sector joining Mvelaphanda Holdings and the Mvelaphanda Group, responsible for business strategy development.

===Billy Masetlha===
Billy Masetlha was suspended on 22 October 2005 because of allegations that he had conducted illegal intelligence operation against an ANC official and businessman Saki Macozoma, a Mbeki supporter, a potential alternative candidate for president. It appeared that a succession battle for the presidency was occurring within the ANC between Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma, with high-ranking civil servants involved. Saki Macozoma had complained to Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils that he was under NIA surveillance, an operation that Kasrils was not aware was occurring. The Inspector-General of Intelligence Zolile Ngcakani was asked to investigate the allegations by Kasrils as to whether the operation had taken place and whether it was legal, which took three weeks to investigate, and he announced that it was unlawful and illegal. The other two suspended NIA officials were Gibson Njenje and Funokwakhe Madlala. It appeared that Macozoma become entangled during surveillance of another person in an authorized operation. On 6 November 2005, Gibson Njenje, head of operations of the NIA, who had been suspended because of his illegal surveillance of Saki Macozoma, resigned though he was not involved in the false e-mail issue being investigated by the Inspector General of Intelligence. With the withdrawal of his legal action against Ronnie Kasrils and the later lifting of his suspension, Njenje had resigned with his pension intact and a settlement package included. Njenje would be back with the NIA in four years as its director.

Later in November 2005, Masetlha challenged his dismissal in the Pretoria High Court alleging that Kasrils did not have the right to suspend him while the state alleged that President Mbeki had instructed the latter to suspend him and therefore was legal. On 22 March 2006, President Mbeki announced that suspended NIA director Masetlha&#x27;s services had been terminated after a breakdown of trust and that trust could not be repaired. His remaining contract would be paid and criminal charges could still be pending. The following day, Inspector General Zolile Ngcakani released details of his investigation of the reasons leading to Masetlha&#x27;s dismissal. Project Avani initially involved no targeting of individuals but was to evaluate potential threats occurring from the succession battle for the Presidency as well as any foreign interference in it, Zuma&#x27;s corruption trial, problems from poor service delivery in the townships and lastly the security and stability in the country. Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils was not aware of the project which appeared legitimate though he should have been informed to provide executive oversight because of the sensitivity of the research. Ngcakani alleged that the project had been highjacked by Masetlha which involved the telephonic interception of conversations of senior ANC officials, the opposition, businessmen and civil servants as well as surveillance of some people. He alleged there appeared to be an authorization from Masetlha to fabricate fake intercepted emails externally and which showed divisions in the ANC&#x27;s succession battle, and these email&#x27;s were included in a report submitted to President Mbeki.

In December 2006 the High Court in Pretoria ruled that there had been a breakdown of trust and the president was within his right to suspend and then sack Masetlha. Masetlha took his dismissal further by going to the Constitutional Court to get his job back and in October 2007 the court ruled in favor of him receiving all the benefits owed to him but ruled for his dismissal saying President Mbeki had the constitutional right to fire him.

He successfully defended the two other criminal cases he was charged with. In November 2007, Billy Masetlha was acquitted of charges of contravening the Intelligence Oversight Act when it was alleged that he had withheld information from the Inspector-General of Intelligence concerning the NIA&#x27;s attempt to spy on businessman Sakumzi Macozoma. By January 2009, Billy Masetlha, IT expert Muziwendoda Kunene and former NIA manager for electronic surveillance Funokwakhe Madlala were acquitted in a Pretoria court of fraud charges relating to hoax emails that implicating senior ANC members in a conspiracy against Jacob Zuma.

===Manala Manzini===
On 29 March 2006, President Thabo Mbeki appointed Manala Manzini as director general of the National Intelligence Agency, who&#x27;d been the acting head since October 2005 with the suspension and eventual termination of Billy Masetlha&#x27;s services. Manzini&#x27;s appointment was for three years. Prior to this appointment, he held the position as head of the technical interception division and after his change of position had appointed Arthur Fraser as head of operations and Pete Richer as NIA deputy director general for systems development. During June 2006, he was part of a delegation including the Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils and the SASS, that visited Zimbabwe and President Robert Mugabe with the aim of kick-starting the South African diplomatic effort to resolve the economic and political issues occurring in that country. His tenureship was tarnished in October 2007 with allegations concerning domestic violence being raised by his wife which he himself would confirm later though no government action was taken against him.

In January 2008, Manzini, the NIA, the President Thabo Mbeki and the South African Police Service became involved in preventing National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi from being charged for corruption by the Scorpions and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Manzini and police Crime Intelligence Service member Mulangi Mphego managed secured an affidavit from the NPA main witness Glenn Agliotti retracting most of his bribery allegations against Selebi and claimed that Gerrie Nel&#x27;s Scorpions and the NPA were engaged in a political campaign against Selebi and that their chief witness Aliotti had been threatened and intimidated into making the allegations. Agliotti would later recant his affidavit against the Scorpions saying he had been drinking before making the statement and police crime intelligence boss Mulangi Mphego was later arrested and charged with defeating the ends of justice in obtaining the affidavit. Further investigations by the Mail and Guardian in November 2008 would find that Manzini had conducted business undertakings and a dodgy property deal with Tania Volschenk, Glenn Agliotti&#x27;s landlady and fixer. Other members of the NIA were also involved in business with Volschenk. By May 2010, the State no longer pursued a prosecution against the now former head of police crime intelligence Mulangi Mphego. Selebi was later found guilty of corruption on 2 July 2010, but not guilty of further charges of perverting the course of justice. In May 2008, the NIA claimed that the xenophobic violence against foreigners in the country was being investigated as to whether there was a political aspect to the violence (third force) other than criminal and social reasons, aimed at destabilising and influencing the forthcoming 2009 general elections.

During October 2008, Manzini was accused by Joe Matthews of blocking the official release of a ministerial review of the intelligence services by ex-Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils despite the report being in the public domain and then attempted to retrieve it from the publisher of the review claiming if had never been declassified. The review recommended significant reforms to the South African intelligence services and called for an end to the vague mandate the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) had to gather domestic political and economic intelligence, which has been open to abuse.

By 9 May 2009, Jacob Zuma had assumed the presidency of South Africa and with Manzini&#x27;s term ending on 31 August, it became clear that Zuma would prefer a trusted and loyal colleague as the new director general of the NIA with one name being mentioned, Mo Shaik. Manzini&#x27;s contract, as anticipated, was not extended and on 2 October 2009, Lizo Gibson Njenje was appointed as director of the NIA. On the same date in 2009, the National Intelligence Agency now became a division of the new State Security Agency and would still responsible for domestic intelligence, retaining its own branch Director. The State Security Agency Director General and the domestic intelligence Director in turn report via the National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (NICOC) to the Minister of State Security.

===Gibson Njenje===
Gibson Njenje prior to his current appointment as director of the NIA in October 2009 had previously been head of NIA operations between 2003 and 2005 before resigning and returning to the private sector with involvement in at least thirty businesses. Prior to the NIAs formation in 1995, he was the Deputy Head of Counter Intelligence in the ANCs Department of Intelligence and Security.

He would hold the current position for almost two years before ANC infighting would again claim a head of the NIA. On 10 September 2011, Brian Dube, spokesman for State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele, announced director of the NIA, Gibson Njenje, had resigned which was promptly denied by Njenje demanding proof of a resignation letter. It was said that his relationship with President Jacob Zuma and State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele had become acrimonious. Reason for his &#x27;resignation&#x27; concerned issues with Cwele that included political intelligence gathering operations being conducted on senior ANC members and ministers involved in a succession battle in Mangaung. In parliament, Cwele would not be drawn on the reasons for Njenje resignation nor whether Mo Shaik, foreign intelligence branch director and Jeff Maqetuka, State Security Agency director-general would lose their jobs too.

Other reasons mentioned for the breakdown included Cwele&#x27;s lack of experience and management style in relation to the security environment and intelligence protection for his wife, Sheryl, during her drug-smuggling trial that resulted in her conviction and sentence to 12 years in jail which she would appeal. By 2013 it was believed the real reason for the &#x27;resignations&#x27; was the intelligence agencies investigation of the Gupta family&#x27;s influence of South African political leaders and government officials, regarding it as a threat to national security but when Cwele found out, he had the investigation stopped.

===Dennis Dlomo===
Dennis Thokozani Dlomo has been appointed National Intelligence Co-ordination Committee (Nicoc) intelligence co-ordinator on the 2 August 2013. No sources say who was the acting director of the domestic branch (NIA) was, but during the 2011-2013 period, Dlomo was the acting director-general of the State Security Agency.

===Simon Ntombela===
In August 2013, the Minister for State Security, Siyabonga Cwele, announced the new Domestic Intelligence Director as Simon Ntombela. Previous to this appointment, Ntombela had been the acting director of the foreign intelligence branch (old South African Secret Service). Other appointments made at the same time were Nozuko Bam Deputy Director: Domestic Collection, Africa and Thulani Dlomo as Deputy Director: Counter-Intelligence. But by the 3 September 2014, the now new Minister of State Security, David Mahlobo announced that Director of the Domestic Branch of the State Security Agency, Simon Ntombela and Deputy Director General of Domestic Collection Nozuko Bam, both appointed in 2013, have been “redeployed” to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. DA Shadow Deputy Minister of State Security David Maynier MP expressed concern at the loss of experienced intelligence officials while Thulani Dhlomo, Deputy Director Counter Intelligence was retained despite serious allegations of corruption against him. He would refer the matter to Chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence (JSCI), Connie September to investigate. Ntombela was later appointed South African Ambassador to Poland.

===Bheki WJ Langa===
Bheki WJ Langa was appointed head of the domestic branch of the State Security Agency on 1 August 2015 filling the post that remained empty since the redeployment of Simon Ntombela in September 2014. Prior to his appointment, he was an ambassador to China and has a PhD in economics and prior to 1994 received comprehensive intelligence training in Russia. During January 2015, the State Security Agency was rocked by the leaking of NIA intelligence documents to the news agency al-Jazeera where the NIA was described by a quote from an intelligence officer to The Guardian as being politically factionalised and penetrated by foreign agencies.

<doc id="979088" wikidata="Q60109" url="?curid=979088" title="Michael Stich">
<text>Michael Detlef Stich (; born 18 October 1968) is a German former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 2 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), achieved in 1993, and No. 9 in men&#x27;s doubles, achieved in 1991. Stich won 18 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including the 1991 Wimbledon Championships, as well as the 1993 ATP Tour World Championships and the 1992 Grand Slam Cup. He also won ten doubles titles, including the men&#x27;s doubles title at the 1992 Wimbledon Championships, partnering John McEnroe, and the gold medal in men&#x27;s doubles 1992 Barcelona Olympics, partnering Boris Becker. Stich was part of the victorious German team at the 1993 Davis Cup, and was also the singles runner-up at the 1994 US Open and the 1996 French Open.

==Career==
Stich was raised in Elmshorn, Schleswig-Holstein. He turned professional in 1988 and won his first top-level singles title in 1990 at Memphis, Tennessee.

Stich won Wimbledon in 1991. He defeated the defending champion and world No. 1 Stefan Edberg in the semifinals, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6, 7–6, without breaking his service once. Then in the final, he beat his compatriot and three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker in straight sets.

In 1992, Stich teamed with John McEnroe to win the men&#x27;s doubles title at Wimbledon in a five-set, five-hour final that stretched into Monday (the day after the tournament normally ends) and ended with a 19–17 set. No male player since has won both singles and doubles at Wimbledon. Then at the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Stich teamed with Becker to win the men&#x27;s doubles gold medal. Stich also won the 1992 Grand Slam Cup, defeating Michael Chang in the final.

A major highlight of 1993 for Stich came at the end-of-year ATP World Championships, where he was the only player in the 1990s history of the Championship tournament to claim the title undefeated, overcoming Pete Sampras in the final. Playing for Germany, Stich also won both the Davis Cup and the Hopman Cup in 1993.

He reached his second Grand Slam singles final at the 1994 US Open, where he lost in straight sets to Andre Agassi. Stich also helped Germany win the World Team Cup in 1994.

He upset defending champion Thomas Muster in four sets in the fourth round of the 1996 French Open en route to appearing in his third and final Grand Slam singles final, where he lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in straight sets. He also won his final career singles title that year at Antwerp. His last doubles title came in 1997 at Halle.

Stich&#x27;s all-round ability, both from the baseline and at the net, allowed him to become one of the few players to win both singles and doubles tournaments on all surfaces. He is one of only five players of his generation to have a positive career head-to-head record against Sampras.

Stich announced his retirement from the professional tour in 1997, after Wimbledon. His last run at Wimbledon started with a win over US top-ten player Jim Courier and ended with a five-set loss to Cédric Pioline in the semifinals.

Since his retirement, he has devoted most of his time to his AIDS foundation. He also works as a tennis commentator for the BBC. In 2018, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Stich was married to the German actress Jessica Stockmann from 1992 to 2003. In 2005, he married Alexandra Rikowski. They live in Hamburg.

<text>Justice League Unlimited (JLU) is an American superhero animated television series that was produced by Warner Bros. Animation with DC Comics in season 3 and aired on Cartoon Network. Featuring a wide array of superheroes from the DC Universe, and specifically based on the Justice League superhero team, it is a direct sequel to the previous &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series and picks up around two years after it. &quot;JLU&quot; debuted on July 31, 2004, on Toonami and ended on May 13, 2006.

It is the eighth and final series of the DC Animated Universe, serving as the conclusion to a shared universe which began with &quot;&quot;. Notably, it is the most continuity-heavy show of the DC Animated Universe, and weaves together characters and plot lines from past series. &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; received critical acclaim.

==Overview==
According to producer Bruce Timm, the series finale of &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Starcrossed&quot;, was possibly meant to be the final episode of the series; however, Cartoon Network ordered the production of season 3 and 4. The network wanted the show to be rebranded, including changing the episode format, so instead of two-part episode stories, the standard half an hour format was used. Additionally, alongside the name change, the show features a greatly expanded League, in which the characters from the original series—now referred to as &quot;founding members&quot;—are joined by many other superheroes from the DC Universe; in the first episode, well over 50 characters appear. A number of these were heroes who had made guest appearances in &quot;Justice League&quot;, but many heroes and other characters made their first animated appearances in this series. The general format of each episode is to have a small team assemble to deal with a particular situation, with a focus on both action and character interaction. This extension of the Justice League was originally planned to be explained in a planned direct-to-video feature film, but the project never materialized.

===Production===
&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; features both episodic and serialized episodes, the first major overarching story arc involves the growing conflict between the League and a secret government agency known as Project Cadmus. This plot line builds upon events that occurred during the second season of &quot;Justice League&quot; (which in turn built upon events in &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;), and would go on to affect the plotlines of most of its episodes. It was resolved in a four-part story at the end of the second season of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

The third and final season story arc focuses on the new Secret Society, a loose-knit organization formed to combat the increased superhero coordination of the first season. Towards the end of the series, certain characters became off-limits to the show, particularly characters associated with Batman, were restricted due to the unrelated animated series &quot;The Batman&quot; and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s live-action &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, to avoid continuity confusion, thus leading to the popular term known as “Bat-embargo&quot;. Aquaman and related characters were unavailable due to the development of a pilot for a live-action series featuring the character as a young man (planned to be a spin-off of &quot;Smallville&quot;). To compensate for this, the last season focused their stories on previously overlooked DC Comics characters and mythos. These included characters like Deadman, Viking Prince, and Warlord.

The series, along with the entire DC Animated Universe, was originally planned to end after the second-season finale &quot;Epilogue&quot;, which concluded the story of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; and thus the entire DCAU chronologically. But a third season was greenlit by Cartoon Network. The third season started in 2005 with the episode &quot;I Am Legion&quot; (which was written before the announcement of a third season) and ended in 2006 with the episode &quot;Destroyer&quot;. Stan Berkowitz, a member of the production team, left the show later for the TV series &quot;Friends and Heroes&quot;, and writer Matt Wayne was contracted to replace him. According to Matt Wayne, if the show had been renewed for a fourth season, he would have liked to write more episodes focusing on Superman and Wonder Woman.

DC Comics created an ongoing monthly comic book series based on the TV series, as part of its Johnny DC line of &quot;all ages&quot; comics, which did not have the same restrictions regarding character appearances.

&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, like the second season of &quot;Justice League&quot;, is animated in widescreen. The show also features new theme music and intro (nominated for an Emmy). The two-part series finale was aired in the UK on February 8 and 18, 2006, and in the United States on May 6 and 13, 2006.

==Reception==
&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; received critical acclaim and is listed as one of the best animated television shows of all time. IGN named &quot;Justice League/Justice League Unlimited&quot; as the 20th best animated television series of all time. Similarly, IndieWire also ranked the series as the 20th best animated show of all time.

James Whitbrook, editor of io9, wrote &quot;&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; is simply the greatest superhero show of all time&quot;, further stating &quot;it embraced its source material wholly, and was unafraid to be the wildest, biggest, comic-book-iest show it could be.&quot;

Producer Bruce Timm has stated that amongst all the shows he has worked on, this show is his favorite.

==Home media==
From 2006 to 2007, Warner Home Video (via DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the entire series of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; on DVD. The series is presented in original broadcast presentation and story arc continuity order. The series was also released on Blu-Ray.
Warner Home Video also released another DVD set titled &quot;Justice League: The Complete Series&quot;. It contained all 91 episodes of &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; on a 15-disc set with the 15th disc containing a bonus documentary. The same episodes were later sold as a 10-disc set without the bonus documentary.

==Soundtrack==
La-La Land Records released a 4-disc &quot;Justice League&quot; soundtrack on July 29, 2016. A potential &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; soundtrack depends on how well the &quot;Justice League&quot; soundtrack sells.

<doc id="979094" wikidata="Q4877045" url="?curid=979094" title="Beatification and canonization process prior to 1983">
<text>The process of beatification and canonization has undergone various reforms in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. For current practice, as well as a discussion of similar processes in other churches, see the article on canonization. This article describes the process as it was before the promulgation of the &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot; (&quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;) of 1983.

The causes of martyrs were considered somewhat differently from those of confessors, for some points of the process.

Until after the Second Vatican Council, the conclusive acts of the canon practice and procedure of canonization were
# the Pontifical Bull of Canonization,
# and the Pontifical High Mass of Canonization (Beatification) celebrated in the Vatican Basilica, during which the Pope officially proclaimed the martyr or the confessor to be Saint for the whole Catholic Church. 
The saint may have a church consecrated with his or her name, or be prayed to as an intercessor during a Votive Mass.

==Beatification==

===Of Confessors===

In order to secure beatification, the most important and difficult step in the process of canonization, the regular procedure was as follows:

#Selection of a vice-postulator by the postulator-general of the cause, to promote all the judicial inquiries necessary in places outside of Rome. Such inquiries were instituted by the local episcopal authority.
# The preparation of the inquiries (&quot;processus&quot;) all of which were carried on by the ordinary episcopal authority. They were of three kinds: (a) Informative inquiries regarded the reputation for sanctity and miracles of the servants of God, not only in general, but also in particular instances; there might be several such inquiries if the witnesses to be examined belonged to different dioceses. (b) Processes &quot;de non cultu&quot; were instituted to prove that the decrees of Pope Urban VIII regarding the prohibition of public veneration of servants of God before their beatification had been obeyed; they were generally conducted by the bishop of the place where the relics of the servant of God were preserved. (c) Other inquiries were known as &quot;processiculi diligentiarum&quot; and had for their object the writings attributed to the person whose beatification was in question; they varied in number according to the dioceses where such writings were found, or were thought likely to be found, and might not be judicially executed before an &quot;instruction&quot; was obtained from the Promotor of the Faith by the Postulator General and by him sent to the bishop in question.
# The results of all these inquiries were sent to Rome, to the Congregation of Rites, in charge of a messenger (&quot;portitor&quot;) chosen by the judges, or by some other secure way, in case a rescript of the Congregation dispensed from the obligation of sending a messenger.
# They were opened, translated if necessary into Italian, a public copy was made, and a cardinal was deputed by the Pope as relator (&quot;ponens&quot;) of the cause, for all which steps rescripts of the Congregation, confirmed by the Pope, must be obtained.
# The writings of the servant of God were next revised by theologians appointed by the cardinal Relator himself, authorized to so act by a special rescript. Meanwhile, the Advocate and the Procurator of the cause, chosen by the Postulator General, had prepared all the documents that concerned the introduction of the cause (&quot;positio super introductione causae&quot;). These consisted of (a) a summary of the informative processes, (b) an information, and (c) answers to the observations or difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith sent by him to the Postulator.
#This collection of documents (&quot;positio&quot;) was printed and distributed to the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites 40 days before the date assigned for their discussion.
#If nothing contrary to faith and morals was found in the writings of the servant of God, a decree was published that authorized further action (&quot;quod in causa procedi possit ad ulteriora&quot;), i. e., the discussion of the matter (&quot;dubium&quot;) of appointment or non-appointment of a commission for the introduction of the cause.
# At the time fixed by the Congregation of Rites an ordinary meeting (&quot;congregatio&quot;) was held in which this appointment was debated by the cardinals of the aforesaid Congregation and its officials, but without the vote or participation of the Consultors, though this privilege was always granted them by prescript.
# If in this meeting the cardinals favoured the appointment of the aforesaid Commission, a decree to that effect was promulgated, and the Pope signed it, but, according to custom, with his baptismal name, not with that of his pontificate. Thenceforward the servant of God was judicially given the title of &quot;Venerable&quot;.
# A petition was then presented asking remissorial letters for the bishops outside of Rome (&quot;in partibus&quot;), authorizing them to set on foot, by Apostolic authority, the inquiry (&quot;processus&quot;) with regard to the fame of sanctity and miracles in general. This permission was granted by rescript, and such remissorial letters were prepared and sent to the bishops by the Postulator General. In case the eyewitnesses were of advanced age, other remissorial letters were usually granted for the purpose of opening a process known as &quot;inchoative&quot; concerning the particular virtues of miracles of the person in question. This was done in order that the proofs might not be lost (&quot;ne pereant probationes&quot;), and such inchoative process preceded that upon the miracles and virtues in general.
# While the Apostolic process concerning the reputation of sanctity was under way outside of Rome, documents were prepared by the Procurator of the cause for the discussion &quot;de non cultu&quot;, or absence of &quot;cultus&quot;, and at the appointed time an ordinary meeting (&quot;congregatio&quot;) was held in which the matter was investigated; if it was found that the decree of Pope Urban VIII had been obeyed, another decree provided that further steps might be taken.
# When the inquiry concerning the reputation of sanctity (&quot;super fama&quot;) had arrived in Rome, it was opened (as already described in speaking of the ordinary processes, and with the same formalities in regard to rescripts), then translated into Italian, summarized, and declared valid. The documents &quot;super fama&quot; in general were prepared by the Advocate, and at the proper time, in an ordinary meeting of the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites, the question was discussed: whether there was evidence of a general repute for sanctity and miracles of this servant of God. If the answer was favourable, a decree embodying this result was published.
# New remissorial letters were then sent to the bishops &quot;in partibus&quot; for Apostolic processes with regard to the reputation for sanctity and miracles in particular. These processes must be finished within 18 months and when they were received in Rome were opened, as above described, and by virtue of an equal number of rescripts, by the cardinal Prefect, translated into Italian, and their summary authenticated by the Chancellor of the Congregation of Rites.
# The Advocate of the cause next prepared the documents (&quot;positio&quot;) which had reference to the discussion of the validity of all the preceding processes, informative and Apostolic.
# This discussion was held in the meeting called &quot;congregatio rotalis&quot; from the fact that it was only judges of the Roman Rota who voted. If the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith were satisfactorily answered, the decree establishing the validity of the inquiries or processes was published.
# Meanwhile, all necessary preparation was made for the discussion of the question (&quot;dubium&quot;): Is there evidence that the venerable servant of God practiced virtues both theological and cardinal, and in an heroic degree? (&quot;An constet de virtutibus Ven. servi Dei, tam theologicis quam cardinalibus, in heroico gradu?&quot;) In the causes of confessors this step was of primary importance. The point was discussed in three meetings or congregations called respectively, ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general. The first of these meetings was held in the palace of the cardinal Relator of the cause, and in it only consultors of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, and with their prefect presiding, the third was also held in the Vatican City, and at it the Pope presided, and both cardinals and consultors voted. For each of these congregations the Advocate of the cause prepared and printed official reports (&quot;positiones&quot;), called respectively &quot;report&quot;, &quot;new report&quot;, &quot;final report&quot;, report &quot;concerning the virtues&quot;, et cetera (&quot;positio&quot;, &quot;positio nova&quot;, &quot;positio novissima&quot;, &quot;super virtutibus&quot;, et cetera). In each case, before proceeding to the subsequent meeting, a majority of the Consultors must decide that the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith had been satisfactorily solved.
# When the Congregation of Rites in the above described general meeting had decided favourably, the Pope was asked to sign the solemn decree which asserted that there existed evidence of the heroic virtues of the servant of God. This decree was not published until after the Pope, having commended the matter to God in prayer, gave a final consent and confirmed by his supreme sentence the decision of the Congregation.
# The miracles now remained to be proved, of which two of the first class were required in case the practice of virtues in the heroic degree had been proved, in both ordinary and Apostolic inquiries or processes by eyewitnesses: three, if the eyewitnesses were found only in the ordinary processes and four, if the virtues were proven only by hearsay (&quot;de auditu&quot;) witnesses. If the miracles had been sufficiently proven in the Apostolic processes (&quot;super virtutibus&quot;) already declared valid, steps were taken at once to prepare the documents with regard to miracles (&quot;super miraculis&quot;). If in the Apostolic processes only general mention had been made of the miracles, new Apostolic processes must be opened, and conducted after the manner already described for proving the practice of virtues in an heroic degree.
# The discussion of the particular miracles proceeded in exactly the same way and in the same order as that of the virtues. If the decisions were favourable, the general meeting of the Congregation was followed by a decree, confirmed by the Pope, in which it was announced that there was proof of miracles. In the &quot;positio&quot; for the ante-preparatory congregation there were required and were printed opinions of two physicians, one of whom had been chosen by the Postulator and the other by the Congregation of Rites. Of the three reports (&quot;positiones&quot;) above mentioned, and which were now also required, the first was prepared in the usual way; the second consisted of an exposition of the heroic virtues of the servant of God, an information, and a reply to later observations of the Promotor of the Faith; the last consisted only of an answer to his final observations.
# When the miracles had been proved, another meeting of the Congregation of Rites was held in which it was debated once, and only once, whether or not, given the approbation of the virtues and miracles, it was safe to proceed with the solemnities of beatification. If a majority of the Consultors was favourable, the Pope issued a decree to this effect and at the time appointed by him the solemn beatification of the servant of God occurred in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, on which occasion a Papal brief was issued permitting the public &quot;cultus&quot; and veneration of the beatified person, now known as &quot;Blessed&quot; (&quot;&quot;Beatus&quot;).

===Of Martyrs===

# The causes of martyrs were conducted in the same way as those of confessors as far as the informative processes and those &quot;de non cultu&quot; and &quot;ad introductionem causae&quot; were concerned. But when once the commission of introduction had been appointed they advance much more rapidly.
# No remissorial letters were granted for Apostolic processes concerning the general reputation for martyrdom and miracles; the letters sent called for an immediate investigation into the fact of martyrdom, its motive, and the particular miracles alleged. There was no longer a discussion of the general reputation for martyrdom or miracles.
# The miracles were not discussed, as formerly, in separate meetings, but in the same meetings that dealt with the fact and the motive of the martyrdom.
# The miracles (&quot;signa&quot;) required were not those of the first class; those of the second class sufficed, nor was their number determined. On some occasions the decision as to miracles was entirely dispensed with.
# The discussion as to martyrdoms and miracles, formerly held in three meetings or congregations, viz. the ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general, was at a later time usually conducted, through a dispensation to be had in each instance from the sovereign pontiff, in a single congregation known as particularis, or special. It consisted of six or seven cardinals of the Congregation of Rites and four or five prelates especially deputed by the pope. There was but one positio prepared in the usual way; if there was an affirmative majority a decree was issued concerning the proof of martyrdom, the cause of martyrdom, and miracles. (&quot;Constare de Martyrio&quot;, &quot;causâ Martyrii et signis&quot;.)
# The final stage was a discussion of the security (&quot;super tuto&quot;) with which advance to beatification might be made, as in the case of confessors; the solemn beatification then followed.

===Confirmation of Cult===
This procedure was followed in all cases of formal beatification in causes of both confessors and martyrs proposed in the ordinary way (&quot;per viam non cultus&quot;). Those proposed as coming under the definition of cases excepted (&quot;casus excepti&quot;&quot;) by Pope Urban VIII were treated differently. In such cases proof is required that an immemorial public veneration had been paid to the servant of God, whether as a confessor or martyr, for at least 100 years before the promulgation in 1640 of the decrees of Pope Urban VIII. Such cause was proposed under the title of &quot;confirmation of veneration&quot; (&quot;de confirmatione cultus&quot;); it was considered in an ordinary meeting of the Congregation of Rites. When the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith had been satisfied, a Pontifical decree confirming the &quot;cultus&quot; was promulgated. Beatification of this kind was denominated &quot;equivalent&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot;.

==Canonization==
The canonization of confessors or martyrs might be taken up as soon as two miracles were reported to have been worked at their intercession, after the pontifical permission of public veneration as described above. At this stage it was only required that the two miracles worked after the permission awarding a public cultus be discussed in three meetings of the congregation. The discussion proceeded in the ordinary way; if the miracles were confirmed, another meeting (&quot;super tuto&quot;) was held. The pope then issued a Bull of Canonization in which he not only permitted, but commanded, the public cultus, or veneration, of the saint.

It may be easily conjectured that considerable time must elapse before any cause of beatification or canonization could be conducted, from the first steps of the information, inquiry, or process, to the issuing of the decree super tuto. According to the constitution of this Congregation, more than one important discussion (&quot;dubia maiora&quot;) could not be proposed at the same time. It must be remembered:

* that the same cardinals and consultors must vote in all discussions;
* that there was but one promotor of the Faith and one sub-promotor, who alone had charge of all observations to be made with regard to the &quot;dubia&quot;; and
* that these cardinals and consultors had to treat questions of ritual as well as processes of canonization and beatification.

To execute all this business there was but one weekly meeting (&quot;congressus&quot;), a kind of minor congregation in which only the cardinal prefect and the major officials voted; in it less important and practical questions were settled regarding rites as well as causes, and answers were given, and rescripts which the Pope afterwards verbally approved. The other meetings of the congregation (ordinary, rotal, and &quot;upon virtues and miracles&quot;) might be as few as sixteen in the course of the year. Some other cause must therefore be found for the slow progress of causes of beatification or canonization than a lack of good will or activity on the part of the Congregation of Rites.

<text>The South African Secret Service (SASS) was the previous name of a South African intelligence agency. Currently, it is known as the Foreign Branch of the State Security Agency. It is responsible for all non-military foreign intelligence and for counterintelligence within the Service itself. It is also responsible for gathering, correlating, evaluating and analysing this intelligence.

==History==
The SASS was formed in 1994 following South African first multiracial elections. It was created to take over the foreign intelligence functions of the now-defunct National Intelligence Service (NIS), with the domestic intelligence responsibilities taken up by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA). Both the SASS and NIA were created as part of the Intelligence Act of 1994. The service performs intelligence at the request of the President and the Minister of State Security. The Service is run by a Director-General. Prior to 2009, the Service was a self-governing organisation which was a member of the National Intelligence Co-Ordinating Committee (NICOC). Since 2009, the South African Secret Service is now a division of the State Security Agency (South Africa) and still responsible for foreign intelligence, retaining its own branch Director. The State Security Agency Director General and the SASS foreign intelligence Director in turn report via the National Intelligence Co-Ordinating Committee to the Minister of State Security. In August 2013, the Minister for State Security, Siyabonga Cwele, announced the new foreign intelligence Director as Batandwa Siswana. Other appointments made at the same time were Joyce Mashele as deputy director general for collection, Africa and Matshidiso Mhlambo as deputy director general for the rest of the world.

==Directors-General==
* 1995 – 1996 Mike Louw
* 1996 – 1999 Billy Masetlha
* 1999 – 2009 Hilton Dennis
* 2009 – 2012 Mo Shaik
* 2012 – 2013 Simon Ntombela (acting DG)
* 2013 – 2016 Batandwa Siswana
* 2016 – 2020 Joyce Mashele (acting DG)
* 2020 – 2021 (suspended) Robert McBride
* 2021–present Joyce Mashele (acting DG)

==Current status==
The Service is extremely secretive about its operations, and thus few details reach the public. However, when taking current South African policy and concerns into account, it appears the attentions of the SASS are currently focused on two main areas: The activities of Al-Qaeda and similar groups abroad in relation to South Africa&#x27;s security, and the activities of illegal South African mercenaries, most especially in parts of Africa and Iraq. The South African Secret Service is one of the elite intelligence organisations in Africa; another is the State Security Service in Nigeria.

==In popular culture==
The SASS appear in the 2017–2018 Millarworld comic book series &quot;&quot;, primarily embodied by Agent Kwaito.

<text>Hrastnik (, German: &quot;Hrastnigg&quot;) is a town in the Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Hrastnik. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The entire municipality is now included in the Central Sava Statistical Region.

==History==
In the past, the majority of locals were employed in the glass, coal, or chemical industry. Today the glass and chemicals factories still operate, but many people also go to work in neighbouring towns such as Trbovlje or Zagorje ob Savi. Coal started being mined in Hrastnik in 1822. Production was limited until 1849, when the town was connected to the Austrian Southern Railway. Hrastnik is also known for glass manufacturing. The first school was opened in Hrastnik in 1860. It was originally operated for miners&#x27; children at the miners&#x27; restaurant but became a public school in 1872. A separate school building was built in 1879. A German-language school was established in 1907 and operated until the end of the First World War.

===Mass grave===

Hrastnik is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Senica Ravine Mass Grave () is located below an orchard by the house at Pot na Kal no. 2. It contains an undetermined number of victims.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Christ the King and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It was built in 1936. A second church in the south of the settlement, belonging to the same parish, is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. It dates to the 16th century with major 17th-century adaptations.

<text>Kamnik (; or &quot;Stein in Oberkrain&quot;) is the ninth-largest town of Slovenia, located in the traditional province of Upper Carniola (northern Slovenia). It is the seat of the Municipality of Kamnik, which encompasses a large part of the Kamnik Alps and the surrounding area. The town of Kamnik has three castles as well as many examples of historical architecture.

==History==
The name Kamnik was first mentioned in the 11th century. The first time it was mentioned as a town was in 1229, when it was an important trading post on the road between Ljubljana and Celje. This makes the town one of the oldest in Slovenia. In the Middle Ages, Kamnik had its own mint and some aristocratic families among its residents. The town was among the most influential centers of power for the Bavarian counts of Andechs in the region of Carniola at the time. The only remnant of the Bavarian nobility are the two ruined castles which are both strategically built on high ground near the town center. The Franciscan monastery built in the town itself is a testament to its importance. The building is well preserved and has undergone extensive renovation in recent years.

Historical suburbs of the town include Šut(i)na (), Na Produ (), Novi Trg (, ), Pred Mostom (, ), Graben, and Podgoro. In 1934 the following formerly independent settlements were annexed by Kamnik: Fužine (), Žale (in older sources also &quot;Žalje&quot;, ), Zaprice (), Kratno, Pugled, Zgornje Perovo (), Spodnje Perovo (), Bakovnik, and the lower part of Mekinje.

Most of the old town center is built in an Austro-Hungarian style. Most of the facades have been renovated in recent years but the process is still ongoing.

===Mass grave===

Kamnik is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Cuzak Meadow Mass Grave () is located in the southeast part of the town, in a grassy area encircled by a road on the premises of the Svit factory. The grave contains the remains of several hundred soldiers and civilians, mostly Croats but also some Serbs, that were murdered on 11 May 1945.

<doc id="979140" wikidata="Q682330" url="?curid=979140" title="Triumvirat">
<text>Triumvirat was a West German progressive rock band from Cologne in then-West Germany. They became, during the 1970s, a key figure in Eurock, the progressive rock of continental Europe whose German variant is called krautrock. The name Triumvirat comes from the Latin word &quot;triumvirate&quot;, which refers to a group of three powerful individuals.

Members of the original band were Hans-Jürgen Fritz (aka Jürgen Fritz) on keyboards, Werner Frangenberg on bass and vocals, and drummer-percussionist-lyricist Hans Bathelt. However, that line-up would be in a constant state of flux over the band&#x27;s career, with each album featuring at least one different member. 

The band was often criticized for the similarity of their sound to British band Emerson, Lake and Palmer, something that band members may have had in mind when they wrote the song &quot;Lucky Girl&quot; for their &quot;Illusions on a Double Dimple&quot; album, perhaps in response to one of ELP&#x27;s greatest hits &quot;Lucky Man&quot;.
== History ==
=== Beginnings (1969–1972) ===
The group was formed in 1969 in Cologne, Germany. They became known by playing chart hits in local clubs around town. Heavily influenced by the musical style of The Nice and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, they incorporated some of these bands&#x27; songs into their repertoire, like &quot;Rondo&quot; (The Nice) and &quot;Hoedown&quot; (ELP). They eventually abandoned cover versions and started composing their own music, still with a strong Keith Emerson influence for keyboard sounds that is most evident in the prominent use of the Hammond organ. At the height of their glory, the band was often called a clone of ELP by the specialized press, not only because of the similarity of their music and the sound of their keyboards, but also because of keyboardist Fritz&#x27;s virtuosity and classical training.

=== First recordings (1972–1975) ===
In 1972, the trio sent a demo to the EMI Group, and signed their first recording contract. The group then produced their first album, &quot;Mediterranean Tales&quot; in 1972, consisting of two full-side suites. Just before entering the studio, bassist Frangenberg had left the band, to be replaced by Hans-Georg Pape to handle bass duties as well as vocals, with notable exceptions on the song &quot;Eleven Kids,&quot; sung by Fritz, who also delivers two verses in the song &quot;Broken Mirror.&quot;

Bassist-singer Pape left the band to get married. He was replaced by Helmut Köllen, a young guitarist-bassist-singer and Fritz&#x27;s cousin. Köllen was already working with the band as a sound technician.

They returned to the studio in 1974 to produce their second album, &quot;Illusions on a Double Dimple&quot; with the Cologne Opera House Orchestra, Kurt Edelhagen&#x27;s brass section and Karl Drewo&#x27;s saxophone for the &quot;Mister Ten Percent&quot; suite, as well as a chorus composed of Ulla Wiesmer, Brigitte Thomas, and Hanna Dölitzsch. The resulting album showcased the work of both bassists, with Pape playing bass on most of side one&#x27;s &quot;Illusions on a Double Dimple&quot; suite, and Köllen playing bass and guitar on side two&#x27;s &quot;Mister Ten Percent&quot; suite. Köllen handled vocals for the entire album.

Arguably their most accomplished release musically, the album was listed at position 45 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2015 list of &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;.

They undertook a European and American tour at the end of 1974 and into 1975, opening for Fleetwood Mac in the United States. The set consisted of an excerpt from &quot;Mediterranean Tales&quot;&#x27; &quot;Across the Waters&quot; suite followed by the &quot;Illusions on a Double Dimple&quot; album in its entirety.

=== &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Old Loves Die Hard&quot; (1975–1977) ===
In 1975, the trio began recording their third album, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, a retelling of the story of the famed Roman slave and Thracian gladiator in the year 73 BC. The lyrics were written by drummer Hans Bathelt, with the help of keyboardist Fritz and the album was released on EMI / Electrola, distributed in America by Capitol Records. The album debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

The US tour of &quot;Spartacus&quot; included many dates opening for Supertramp. Triumvirat was very well-rehearsed, and often out-shone Supertramp on the tour. They also had an element of fun in their live shows that was rare for a prog band.

After the album release, Helmut Köllen left to pursue a solo career. He began recording his first solo album with the help of Fritz on keyboards and Hans Bathelt for lyrics on one of the songs, &quot;The Story of Life.&quot; He did return to the band, who had already composed new songs, but this return was cut short, among other reasons because the new songs no longer suited his tone of voice. He then dedicated himself to his new solo career, which was also cut short when he unfortunately died on May 3, 1977 at 27 years old, making him a member of the 27 Club. He was listening to a demo tape of his future solo album on his car radio in his garage while the engine was running and died from carbon monoxide poisoning. His completed album would be released posthumously two years later after his death under the title &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; on the Harvest Records label and dedicated to his parents.

The Köllen album included a Beatles song (the title-track), which he was fond of, and another whose lyrics were written by Triumviurat&#x27;s drummer, &quot;The Story of Life.&quot; Musicians present on the album include, among others, Hans-Jürgen Fritz on keyboards, Brigitte Witt on choirs who would later take part in the New Triumvirat band, as well as Helmut&#x27;s sister, Elke Köllen also on chorus. Matthias Holtmann played drums while Köllen handled guitar, bass and vocals. Köllen also featured as a guest on songs by the group Jail, including a single called &quot;Julie&quot; in 1976. Shortly after his death, the German group Birth Control recorded and published a song in tribute to the bassist, entitled &quot;We All Thought We Knew You,&quot; on their album &quot;Increase&quot; produced in 1977.

Triumvirat replaced Köllen with British singer Barry Palmer and calling on their original bassist Werner Frangenberg to record their next album &quot;Old Loves Die Hard&quot;, released in 1976. The album&#x27;s American cover would be the last to feature the iconic white rat that had become the group&#x27;s mascot since their second album. Other markets featured a text-only cover.

=== &quot;Pompeii&quot; and &quot;À la Carte&quot; (1977–1979) ===
In 1977, bassist Frangenberg and drummer-lyricist Hans Bathelt left the band, which called on Curt Cress on drums (from the German band Passport) and bassist Dieter Petereit for the album &quot;Pompeii&quot;. After temporary legal quarrels between the keyboardist Hans-Jürgen Fritz and the drummer Hans Bathelt concerning the name of the group, the album was released under the new name of New Triumvirat. It would be the last album to contain prog-rock; the rest of their discography would not be the same style. This was the main reason for the departure of drummer and lyricist Hans Bathelt, dissatisfied with the direction taken by Hans-Jürgen Fritz and pressure from the record company, which pushed the group towards a more commercial pop music sound.

The next album released in 1978, &quot;À la Carte&quot;, had little or nothing to do with the band of previous years, due to the pressures of the record company that wanted more sales from the group. As the last original member, the other musicians on the album being merely contract players, Fritz did not feel able to protest, and the result was this album that sold less than the previous ones. Changes of personnel for this album comprised Barry Palmer&#x27;s replacement on vocals by David Hanselmann, Werner Kopal taking bassist Dieter Petereit&#x27;s place, and Curt Cress giving way to drummer Matthias Holtmann.

=== &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; and separation (1980) ===
The band&#x27;s last album &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; was released in 1980, with Toto members Steve Lukather on guitar and bass and drummer Jeff Porcaro (who had also played with Steely Dan) plus other studio musicians. But the album dissatisfied keyboardist Fritz who subsequently disbanded the group.

=== Solo Projects ===
In 1987, Barry Palmer produced a maxi single titled &quot;Shimmering Gold&quot; (Max Version) / &quot;Shimmering Gold&quot; (Single Version) / &quot;Cold Nights&quot;, co-produced by Hans-Jürgen Fritz and Andreas Martin Krause; Fritz also wrote the lyrics of &quot;Shimmering Gold&quot;, whilst the music was composed by Eugen Römer. It was released on Titan Records.

In 1989, Hans-Jürgen Fritz released the soundtrack album for the movie &quot;Es ist nicht leicht, ein Gott zu sein&quot; (known as &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot; in English), on the CBS Records label. The last song, &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot;, was sung by Grant Stevens, the rest of the album being instrumental. The film was by Peter Fleischmann, based on a screenplay by Peter Fleischmann and Jean-Claude Carrière, with Edward Zentara and Werner Herzog. Then in 1990, he released his only solo album, again on Columbia Records in Europe, and Sony in America, in the Millennium collection, entitled &quot;Dreams of Amadeus&quot; with Ralf Hildenbeutel, in which the music is based on Mozart themes.

=== Aborted return and reissue of their discography ===
Since 2002, according to the band&#x27;s official website, Triumvirat had to be back with a project called &quot;The Website Story&quot;, which they recorded in 1999, with songs written in partnership with Fritz and John Miles; the project remains unpublished for lack of interest from record companies.

In 2012, EMI released the Essential compilation with songs from their seven albums. Note that all their albums, including their latest &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; have been reissued in 2002 with additional titles, previously only available in singles, special mention for &quot;Illusions on a Double Dimple&quot; which is adorned with a different cover.
