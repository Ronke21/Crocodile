<text>Michael Lee Alfonso (January 24, 1965 – February 17, 2007) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances with the American professional wrestling promotions Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) under the ring name Mike Awesome and for his appearances in Japan with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling as The Gladiator.

Alfonso achieved the biggest success of his career in FMW as The Gladiator, where he became a three-time world champion, with two reigns as Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and one reign as Independent Heavyweight Champion. His second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign from 1996–1997 was the longest reign in the title&#x27;s history, lasting for 489 days. During this reign, he defeated W*ING Kanemura to unify the title with the Independent Heavyweight Championship at the 1996 Year End Spectacular. He would then tour with ECW, where he became a two-time World Heavyweight Champion. He was a member of two separate stables Team Canada in both FMW and WCW.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1989–1990)===
Alfonso was trained to wrestle by Steve Keirn, debuting on February 26, 1989, at the Eddie Graham Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida. Alfonso trained for about one year along with former professional wrestlers, Dennis Knight (Mideon, Phineas Godwin) and &quot;Big&quot; Al Green before making his debut. Alfonso competed in Florida Championship Wrestling, USWA, NWA and World Championship Wrestling, before making his way to FMW in Japan.

===Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling===

====Initial years (1990–1992)====
Alfonso moved on to Japan, joining Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) in September 1990 and using the name The Gladiator. He was recruited by FMW as the replacement for Al Green, who was originally scheduled to compete as Gladiator but moved to WCW. Alfonso debuted in FMW as a monster villain on September 20 in a street fight with Mr. Pogo against Atsushi Onita and Jimmy Backlund, which Alfonso&#x27;s team won. Gladiator was Pogo&#x27;s ally who feuded with Onita and competed with Pogo against Onita and his partners. He lost to Onita in a Chain Deathmatch on October 1, after which Alfonso returned to United States. Onita was impressed by Gladiator and called him back for more tours with FMW. He returned to the company as Mr. Pogo&#x27;s partner in a tag team tournament on January 6, 1991, where the duo lost their first match in the tournament against Onita and Sambo Asako. Pogo and Gladiator made to the semi-final, where they beat Grigory Verichev and Boris Gogichashivili and then defeated Onita and Asako in the final on January 15 to win the tournament. The success of the tournament led Alfonso to work full-time with FMW.

In the summer of 1991, Gladiator would form a villainous alliance with Tarzan Goto, Big Titan and Horace Boulder after Mr. Pogo&#x27;s departure from FMW and resumed the feud with Atsushi Onita. On August 17, Gladiator participated in the Barbed Wire Deathmatch Tournament, in which he defeated Horace Boulder in the quarter-final and lost to Sambo Asako in the semi-final. During this time, Gladiator was inspired by Damian&#x27;s lucha libre videos on travels, which led him to adopt a high-flying style despite his big size. The following month, Gladiator and Big Titan defeated Sambo Asako and Ricky Fuji in a street fight stretcher match at the 2nd Anniversary Show. This partnership led the two to form a tag team which lasted nearly three years. In the fall of the year, Gladiator and Titan participated in the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Team Tournament to determine the inaugural WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Champions, but were eliminated from the round robin stage with total six points. Gladiator and his allies would join The Sheik and Sabu to resume the feud with Onita and his allies throughout 1992. At 3rd Anniversary Show, Big Titan, The Gladiator and Horace Boulder defeated Sambo Asako, Ricky Fuji and The Great Punk in a street fight stretcher match. Later that year, Gladiator and Boulder participated in the Street Fight Tag Team Tournament, where they qualified for the semi-final against Tarzan Goto and Big Titan, which they lost.

====Team Canada and W*ING Alliance (1993–1995)====
In 1993, Gladiator formed the first villainous faction in FMW called Team Canada with Ricky Fuji, Big Titan, Horace Boulder, Dr. Luther and Dr. Hannibal after The Sheik and Sabu turned fan favorites and formed an alliance with Atsushi Onita. At 4th Anniversary Show, the team of Gladiator, Ricky Fuji and Big Titan defeated Katsuji Ueda, The Great Punk and Tarzan Goto in a Captain&#x27;s Fall Losing Captain Leaves Town No Rope Barbed Wire Tornado Street Fight Deathmatch, which Team Canada won. The group strengthened its dominance after Mr. Pogo returned to FMW in the summer of 1993 and took over as the leader of the group. Gladiator and Titan were defeated by Sambo Asako and Mr. Gannosuke at Summer Spectacular. The team of Gladiator, Titan and Fuji gained more success by defeating Asako, Katsuji Ueda and Grigory Verichev in a street fight at Year End Spectacular.

The following year, Gladiator and Titan participated in a double-elimination tournament for the newly created Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, in which they defeated Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya in the quarter-final, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masaru Toi in the semi-final and Mr. Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto in the final to succeed in their block and then defeated Atsushi Onita and Katsutoshi Niiyama in the tournament final on January 18, 1994, to win the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, marking Alfonso&#x27;s first title in FMW. They successfully defended the title against Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako in a street fight on March 29 and then lost the title to Mr. Pogo and Hisakatsu Oya in their second title defense on April 21. The title loss created dissension between Titan and Gladiator. At 5th Anniversary Show, Gladiator, Titan and Fuji took on Fuyuki-Gun in a match, where Gladiator and Titan had a miscommunication with each other but fortunately still managed to win their match. However, Gladiator abandoned his partners after the match to quietly join Team Canada. As a result, Gladiator began feuding with Titan and defeated him in their first singles match against each other on July 31. Gladiator won a rematch at Summer Spectacular, before finally losing to Titan on September 7 to end the rivalry.

In October, Gladiator joined the new W*ING Alliance with Mr. Pogo, Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, Yukihiro Kanemura, Goro Tsurumi, Horace Boulder, Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya. The group mostly consisted of wrestlers from the former W*ING promotion, who held Atsushi Onita and FMW responsible for ending the promotion and had formed the alliance to bring the demise of FMW just like W*ING suffered its demise. On October 28, Gladiator and Pogo defeated Atsushi Onita and Mr. Gannosuke to win the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. They lost the tag titles to Onita and Gannosuke in a rematch on February 24, 1995. At 6th Anniversary Show, Gladiator and Horace Boulder lost to Katsutoshi Niiyama and Masato Tanaka. Later at the event, Mr. Pogo turned on W*ING Alliance by blowing a fireball on Yukihiro Kanemura after Pogo and Kanemura lost their match, which led Gladiator, Boulder and Hisakatsu Oya to follow Pogo and join Lethal Weapon.

====Longest reigning world champion (1995–1997)====
The retirement of Atsushi Onita led FMW to change its direction from deathmatch wrestling to technical wrestling style and Gladiator received a strong push as the archrival of the company&#x27;s new top star Hayabusa. He was booked to win the Grand Slam Tournament in September, in which he defeated Hayabusa in the tournament final on September 26 to win the company&#x27;s top title, the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and cemented his place as the company&#x27;s top villain. Gladiator made his first successful title defense against Horace Boulder on October 25. He suffered a knee injury in the fall of 1995, which forced him to vacate the title on January 5, 1996. Gladiator returned from injury to challenge Super Leather for the title on March 15, but was defeated by Leather. During this time, Víctor Quiñones&#x27; group Puerto Rican Army overturned W*ING and Lethal Weapon to become the top villainous group in FMW and Quinones was luring away members of both factions into his Puerto Rican Army, which led Gladiator to turn fan favorite for the first time in his career. At 7th Anniversary Show, Hisakatsu Oya, Horace Boulder and The Gladiator lost to Super Leather and The Headhunters in a match for the inaugural World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.

On May 27, Gladiator defeated Super Leather to win his second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. Gladiator successfully defended the title against Leather in a rematch on September 1. On September 15, Gladiator and Horace Boulder turned on Ricky Fuji during a match against Hideki Hosaka, Hido and Taka Michinoku. The entire Lethal Weapon attacked Fuji and turned on him to join Terry Funk&#x27;s new group Funk Masters of Wrestling, which led Gladiator to turn into a villain again. On October 12, Gladiator attacked W*ING Kanemura after Kanemura successfully defended the Independent Heavyweight Championship against Hisakatsu Oya and Gladiator challenged Kanemura to a title unification match for both Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship at Year End Spectacular, which Gladiator won and unified both titles to become the first-ever FMW Double Champion. Gladiator successfully defended his Double Championship against Masato Tanaka on February 18, 1997. Gladiator would then resume his feud with the returning Atsushi Onita as the team of Gladiator, Terry Funk and Cactus Jack was defeated by Atsushi Onita, Masato Tanaka and W*ING Kanemura at 8th Anniversary Show on April 29. The following day, on April 30, Gladiator surpassed Atsushi Onita&#x27;s fourth reign of 337 days to become the longest reigning Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion by having reigned for 338 days at that point.

On August 5, Hisakatsu Oya, Mr. Gannosuke and The Gladiator defeated Fuyuki-Gun at a Fuyuki Army show to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to the team of Hayabusa, Koji Nakagawa and Masato Tanaka on August 31. At Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular, Gladiator lost the Double Championship to Masato Tanaka, thus ending his Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign at 489 days and his Independent Heavyweight Championship reign at 291 days, making him the longest reigning Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and the longest reigning Independent Heavyweight Champion.

====ZEN and departure (1997–1998)====

Following Terry Funk&#x27;s departure from FMW, Funk Masters (FMW) of Wrestling began to cripple as Atsushi Onita denounced himself as a FMW wrestler and formed ZEN on September 30, 1997, to feud with FMW. On October 21, Super Leather and The Gladiator lost a match to their former teammates Hisakatsu Oya and Mr. Gannosuke, after which Gladiator attacked Leather and officially ended Funk Masters of Wrestling. Later that night, Gladiator attacked Hayabusa after ZEN members defeated Hayabusa&#x27;s team in the main event and then Gladiator raised the flag of ZEN and joined ZEN, which marked the first time in his career that he had become Atsushi Onita&#x27;s ally after having feuded with him for the past seven years. Gladiator had lost his significance as a main event competitor after losing the Double Championship despite being the longest reigning champion and became a mid-card member of ZEN. The group turned fan favorites in the fall of 1997 when three of its members Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido turned on Atsushi Onita and left the group and they would form Team No Respect in 1998.

In March, Gladiator participated in a tournament to determine the #1 contender for the Double Championship at 9th Anniversary Show. He defeated Hisakatsu Oya in the quarter-final and Yukihiro Kanemura in the semi-final to become the runner-up of the tournament as he lost to Hayabusa in the final. At FMW&#x27;s first pay-per-view event FMW 9th Anniversary Show, Gladiator teamed with ZEN teammate Tetsuhiro Kuroda to take on TNR members Super Leather and Horace Boulder in a losing effort. Later at the event, Atsushi Onita lost a match to TNR member Kodo Fuyuki, which forced Onita to end ZEN. Gladiator became a free agent after ZEN&#x27;s dissolution on May 5. Gladiator&#x27;s last pay-per-view appearance in FMW was at the Welcome to the Darkside pay-per-view on August 22, where he defeated Naohiko Yamazaki, Yoshinori Sasaki and Mr. Pogo #2 in a gauntlet match. On August 26, Gladiator wrestled his last FMW match, in which he defeated longtime rival Super Leather. Alfonso injured his knee during the match and went on a hiatus, during which he returned to United States and toured with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for the rest of the year. He left the company due to disagreement over Kodo Fuyuki&#x27;s style of booking.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1998–1999)===
Alfonso wrestled as The Gladiator for a brief period in All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1998 and 1999.

===Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1994, 1997, 1998, 1999–2000)===
In 1993, Alfonso appeared in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) for a short period (as &quot;Awesome&quot; Mike Awesome), he was convinced to do so by Sabu, whom he befriended during their time in Japan. After Sabu started working for ECW, he returned to Japan and told Michael about the promotion and how he should work there. Although he was initially hesitant, citing a lack of interest, Sabu managed to talk Alfonso into it, who used his frequent-flier miles to go to Philadelphia and wrestle a match for ECW.

On February 5, 1994, at ECW&#x27;s event, The Night the Line Was Crossed, Awesome nearly injured wrestler, J.T. Smith when he performed a high-risk dive to the outside of the ring. Smith&#x27;s back was folded backwards against the guard rail during the impact. This spot appeared in many ECW highlight reels including the intro to a variety of their television programs for years to come (according to ECW announcer Joey Styles his own reaction to the spot inspired his &quot;Oh my God&quot; catchphrase).
Awesome returned to ECW in January 1997 at House Party, defeating Balls Mahoney. At Crossing the Line Again the following month, he lost to Louie Spicolli, departing ECW once more thereafter.

In July 1998, Awesome began appearing for ECW again and continued his feud with Masato Tanaka in the United States. Awesome began in ECW by losing to Tanaka on an episode ECW&#x27;s weekly &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. However, following the match, he delivered an Awesome Bomb to Tanaka over the top rope through a table set up on the outside. Awesome lost to Tanaka again at the August Heat Wave pay-per-view event. In September 1998 at UltraClash, Awesome tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a bout with Balls Mahoney; he did not wrestle again until September 1999.

Almost immediately upon arriving in ECW for his third stint in September 1999, he shocked the wrestling world by winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Anarchy Rulz by defeating the reigning champion Taz and nemesis Masato Tanaka in a three-way dance, which was signed on the spot. Awesome continued to be a major factor in ECW early in 2000, including teaming with Raven to beat Tanaka and Tommy Dreamer for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. He gained a new manager, Judge Jeff Jones, who managed Awesome to the top of winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice in 1999.

===World Championship Wrestling (2000–2001)===
On April 10, 2000, Awesome made a surprise appearance on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;—aiding The New Blood by attacking Kevin Nash—while still reigning as ECW World Heavyweight Champion. Awesome&#x27;s friend Lance Storm has said that he had refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages.

Due to concerns over legal issues, WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on their television shows with the ECW belt. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and ECW champion) appeared a few days later at an ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, accompanied by WCW&#x27;s head of security, where he lost the title to Tazz (a World Wrestling Federation employee), who lost it a week later to Tommy Dreamer (a full-time ECW wrestler) (who incidentally lost it approximately 20 minutes later to Justin Credible). In a shoot interview released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome expressed that he would have rather faced off with his former ECW and WWE colleague Rhyno and suggested that they could have put on a more entertaining match regardless of the circumstances and the manner in which he had left ECW.

Now with WCW, Awesome continued to be a major factor with the New Blood for the next month, teaming with Billy Kidman occasionally to aid him in his feud with Hulk Hogan. Awesome also engaged in an on-and-off feud with Kevin Nash, as well as feuding with Diamond Dallas Page and Kanyon. In May 2000, Awesome threw Kanyon off the top of the first level of a triple cage onto the entrance ramp, which started his &quot;Career Killer&quot; gimmick.

After Bash at the Beach in July 2000, his gimmick was tweaked, with him becoming infatuated with heavyset women and calling himself &quot;The Fat Chick Thriller&quot; and feuded with Scott Steiner and Lance Storm for the WCW United States Championship.

On the September 6, 2000, edition of Thunder, Awesome&#x27;s gimmick was changed to &quot;That &#x27;70s Guy&quot; (a reference to the TV series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;), for which he dressed in 1970s-inspired attire and hosted the &quot;Lava Lamp Lounge&quot; interview segment. He was additionally given a bus that resembled the one featured on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; to drive into arenas as part of his entrance. During this time, he had a feud with Vampiro, which resulted in brawls between Awesome and Vampiro&#x27;s allies, the rap duo Insane Clown Posse (Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope). Awesome battled both ICP members in a handicap match on an episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, during which he hit Shaggy with a powerbomb on the roof of the bus that caused Shaggy to fall to the concrete floor below.

On the January 3, 2001, edition of Thunder, Awesome dropped the 1970s gimmick in favor of a &quot;Canadian Career Killer&quot; gimmick and joined WCW&#x27;s Team Canada stable with Lance Storm and Elix Skipper. A feud with The Filthy Animals led to Awesome challenging Billy Kidman to a Hair-vs-Hair match, on January 15, however before the bout could take place, Team Canada attacked Kidman backstage, leaving him unable to compete. Kidman&#x27;s bald stablemate Konnan replaced him and got the win, giving the Animals the right to cut off Awesome&#x27;s longtime mullet. Awesome then faded into the background, mostly helping Storm in his battles against Ernest &quot;The Cat&quot; Miller. On the final Nitro on March 26, 2001, Awesome and Storm were defeated by Chuck Palumbo and Sean O&#x27;Haire in a WCW World Tag Team Championship match.

In an shoot interview released by Highspots in 2003, Awesome said that the infamous incident between Vince Russo and Hulk Hogan at Bash at the Beach 2000 may have been one of the underlying reasons as to why he was plagued by a string of unfavorable gimmicks. As a cousin of Michael Bollea (Horace Hogan, who also left WCW following the incident), Awesome suggested that Russo may have thought that he was just &quot;too close of kin&quot; to Hulk Hogan and decided to take it out on him.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1996, 2001–2002)===
He first made an appearance in WWF as a jobber on December 12, 1996, losing to Justin Credible who was known then as Aldo Montoya in a dark match for WWF Superstars of Wrestling.

After the March 2001 purchase of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Awesome became part of The Invasion storyline in the WWF. His WWF debut came on the June 25, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during a match which saw Test defending his Hardcore Championship against Rhyno. After Rhyno Gored Test against a wall and pinned him he stood celebrating his new title only to be attacked by Awesome wielding a metal pipe. He then powerbombed Rhyno onto a ladder and pinned him, becoming champion himself due to the 24/7 rule. Awesome was the first &quot;Invader&quot; to gain gold in the WWF, stealing away with the Hardcore belt before any WWF wrestlers could catch him. Awesome&#x27;s hardcore reign came to an end a few weeks later on the July 12 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when he was pinned by Jeff Hardy, thanks to distraction from Edge.
Awesome defeated Edge on the July 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

The feud continued when Edge introduced his tag team partner Christian into the rivalry. Awesome and Lance Storm were defeated by Edge and Christian at Invasion on July 22, Awesome&#x27;s first WWF pay-per-view match. From here Awesome&#x27;s push diminished and he began appearing mostly on WWF&#x27;s b-shows, before being sidelined with an injury in November 2001.

Awesome returned to the SmackDown! brand on the July 27, 2002, edition of &quot;Velocity&quot; where he was defeated by Tajiri. Awesome was a mainstay on &quot;Velocity&quot;, SmackDown!&#x27;s tertiary show, for the next few months jobbing to wrestlers such as Faarooq, Bull Buchanan, Mark Henry and Funaki.

Awesome was released from the WWE on September 27, 2002, along with Shawn Stasiak and Horace Hogan. Awesome was quoted saying, &quot;Being in the WWE (formerly the WWF) sucked. I hated it. You had to kiss everybody&#x27;s ass... You had to be on your political toes all the time. You would not believe the backstage politics. You were getting stabbed in the back constantly. I was so happy when I was told I was gone&quot;.

===Later career (2002–2006)===
From 2002 to 2006, Awesome competed on the independent circuit in the United States and Japan where he returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling as &quot;The Gladiator&quot; once again. On the independent circuit, he had a short stint with Major League Wrestling (MLW) where he won the MLW World Heavyweight Championship from Satoshi Kojima, only to lose it ten minutes later to Steve Corino (Kojima&#x27;s employers, AJPW would not allow him to drop the title to an employee of a rival company Zero-1).

He worked for Pro Wrestling Noah from 2004 to 2005.

In February 2006, after 17 years in the ring, Awesome announced his retirement from wrestling, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and adding that he felt underpaid for his work at the One Night Stand event and that he would only return to the ring &quot;if the money was right&quot;.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)===
In April 2003, Awesome debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He wrestled several matches for the promotion before leaving in May 2003. His TNA in-ring debut was on April 16, 2003, where Awesome defeated Perry Saturn by DQ when The Sandman and New Jack interfered. On April 23, Awesome teamed with Brian Lee and Slash in a losing effort against Perry Saturn, New Jack and The Sandman. On May 14, Awesome competed in his final TNA match where he lost to Mike Sanders in a Tables Match.

===Return to WWE (2005)===
Awesome made an appearance at WWE&#x27;s (formerly the WWF) ECW One Night Stand reunion pay-per-view on June 12, 2005, defeating Masato Tanaka. The crowd greeted Awesome with jeers at the beginning of the match, and commentator Joey Styles made frequent references to Awesome&#x27;s leaving of ECW for WCW and during the match, after Awesome performed a suicide dive, Styles infamously said, &quot;And it&#x27;s a shame he didn&#x27;t succeed in taking his own life&quot;, but by the end the crowd were chanting &quot;This match rules!&quot; and gave both men a standing ovation.

==Other media==
Alfonso appeared in at least four wrestling video games including &quot;ECW Hardcore Revolution&quot;, &quot;WCW Backstage Assault&quot;, &quot;Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō&quot;, and &quot;Fire Pro Wrestling Returns&quot;. The ECW toy series manufactured by Original San Francisco Toymakers released a Mike Awesome action figure in 2000. A WCW action figure of Awesome was released by Toy Biz in 2001.

==Personal life==
Alfonso attended King High School in Tampa, Florida and trained at Stan&#x27;s Gym, an old school muscle gym, on 56th Street. On May 11, 1991, he married his high school sweetheart Delisa Diann Bowers in Hillsborough, Florida. They had two children together; son Casey (born 1996) and daughter Carissa (born 2000). Alfonso was an avid outdoorsman and enjoyed fishing and trail bike riding with friends and his son. He enjoyed mountain biking and would ride frequently at Alafia River State Park in Florida, close to his Tampa home.

Alfonso was the cousin of Hulk Hogan&#x27;s nephew Michael Bollea, who was better known for his stint in WCW under the name Horace Hogan.

After Awesome&#x27;s retirement from professional wrestling, he served as a real estate agent in New Tampa, Florida.

==Death==
On February 17, 2007, a group of Alfonso&#x27;s friends found him dead after he had hanged himself inside his Tampa home. WWE acknowledged his death on the February 20 broadcast of &quot;ECW on Sci-Fi&quot; with an &quot;In Memory...&quot; graphic at the opening of the program, and two days later his family received flowers at Serenity Meadows Funeral Home in Riverview, Florida.

<doc id="994054" wikidata="Q699433" url="?curid=994054" title="Junkers Jumo 211">
<text>The Jumo 211 was a German inverted V-12 aircraft engine, Junkers Motoren&#x27;s primary aircraft engine of World War II. It was the direct competitor to the Daimler-Benz DB 601 and closely paralleled its development. While the Daimler-Benz engine was mostly used in single-engined and twin-engined fighters, the Jumo engine was primarily used in bombers such as Junkers&#x27; own Ju 87 and Ju 88, and Heinkel&#x27;s H-series examples of the Heinkel He 111 medium bomber. It was the most-produced German aero engine of the war, with almost 70,000 examples completed.

==Design and development==
The Jumo 211 was developed by Dr. Franz Josef Neugebauer as scaled-up successor to the earlier Jumo 210. The 210 was Germany&#x27;s first modern aviation engine, with three valves per cylinder, a cast crankcase, and supercharger as standard. When it was designed in the early 1930s, its 700 PS design power was a relatively common power rating and many pre-war German designs were based around it. As it was further developed, the 210G introduced a piston-driven direct fuel injection, allowing it to reach its full potential.

The 1930s saw rapid improvement in aircraft performance and great increases in size. In 1934, even before the new Jumo 210 had completed its acceptance tests, the RLM sent out a request for a new -class engine of about weight. Both Jumo and Daimler-Benz responded, and in order to reach service before the new Daimler-Benz DB 600, the Jumo team decided to make their new design as similar as possible to their 210H model, currently in testing.

The resulting Jumo 211 was first prototyped at Jumo&#x27;s Dessau plant in 1935 and started testing in April 1936. Like the 210H, it featured a mechanical direct fuel injection system using small pistons driven off the crankshaft, three valves per cylinder, and an inverted V layout. It also had an open-cycle cooling system, working at atmospheric pressure. Limited production of the 1,000 PS Jumo 211A started in April 1937 at Dessau, with just over 1,000 completed before full production was started at Magdeburg in July.

Three models were provided with varied settings for its two-speed supercharger, tuned for different low- &quot;versus&quot; high-altitude performance. The first prototype aircraft powered by the 211A appeared in late 1937. Development of the 211 continued with the 211B being released in 1938, with a slightly increased maximum RPM of 2,400 which boosted power to 1200 PS (1184 HP). The later 211C and 211D differed primarily in the propeller gear ratios and other features.

The competing DB 600 design was generally similar but lacked the direct injection system. When the RLM expressed their opinion that all future engines include this feature, Daimler responded by introducing the DB 601 in late 1937.

A major upgrade was started by Junkers in 1940 adapting the Jumo 211 with a pressurized cooling system. Under pressure, the boiling point of water increases, allowing the engine to run hotter. This, in turn, allows a given amount of cooling fluid to carry away more energy. As a result, the engine could run at higher power settings with a smaller radiator system. The resulting 211E proved to be able to run at much higher power settings without overheating, so it was quickly followed by the 211F which included a strengthened crankshaft and a more efficient supercharger. Running at 2,600 RPM the 211F delivered and the 211J (a 211F with intercooler) . Further improvements to this basic line led to the 211N and 211P in 1943, they were equivalent to the 211F/J but with slight boost increases and running at up to 2,700 rpm. Continued development of the 211 line evolved into the Jumo 213.

The Jumo 211 became the major bomber engine of the war, in no small part due to Junkers also building a majority of the bombers then in use. Of course, since it was the Luftwaffe that selected the final engine to be used after competitive testing on prototypes (such as the Dornier Do 217), there is certainly more to it. Limited production capacity for each type, and the fact that the Jumo was perfectly capable (if not superior) in a bomber installation meant that it made sense to use both major types to the fullest; since the Daimler had a slight edge in a lightweight, single-engine application, that left the Jumo to fill in the remaining roles as a bomber engine. Even this wasn&#x27;t enough in the end, and radial engines like the BMW 801 were increasingly put into service alongside the Jumo and DB series, most often in multi-engine installations like the Jumo.

Total production of the 211 series amounted to 68,248 engines, including 1,046 prototypes and development engines, with a production peak of 1700 engines per month in the autumn of 1942. From 1937 to mid-1944, production was spread between factories in Magdeburg, Köthen, Leipzig, Stettin and Strasburg. It was the most-produced German aviation engine of the World War II years, and was quite likely to have been the first model of German aviation engine selected for &quot;unitizing&quot; as a &quot;Kraftei&quot; pre-packaged &quot;engine module&quot; – such &quot;Kraftei&quot; units for the Ju 88A were, as one example, used as to power the Messerschmitt Me 264 V1 competitor for the &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; contract in December 1942.

<text>Steven Eugene Grove (born November 27, 1962), better known as Euge Groove, is an American smooth jazz saxophonist.

==Early life and career==
Born in Hagerstown, Maryland, he graduated from the University of Miami School of Music in 1984. Grove did not record his first solo album until 2000. Prior to that, he had replaced Richard Elliot in the Tower of Power when Elliot decided to pursue a solo career; he also did session work with various pop acts, most noticeably the Miami girl group Exposé. He has a sax solo on their No. 1 hit &quot;Seasons Change,&quot; and another on their 1993 hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me).&quot;

Grove adopted the name Euge Groove; initially presumed to be coined by fans who saw him perform in Europe, Grove later indicated in an interview on XM Radio in 2006 that his mother-in-law conceived the idea for his stage name.

Euge Groove&#x27;s best-known solo hits include &quot;Sneak a Peek,&quot; &quot;Slam Dunk,&quot; &quot;Rewind,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,&quot; &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot; and &quot;XXL.&quot; His most recent hits include &quot;Get &#x27;Em Going&quot;, &quot;Chillaxin&#x27;, and &quot;S7ven Large&quot;. Albums include: “S7ven Large” (2011), “Born 2 Groove” (2006), “Livin&#x27; Large” (2004), “Play Date” (2002) and “Sunday Morning” (2009). In 2008 he went on tour with Tina Turner.

<doc id="994072" wikidata="Q3363263" url="?curid=994072" title="Hills Like White Elephants">
<text>&quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; is a short story by Ernest Hemingway. It was first published in August 1927 in the literary magazine &quot;transition&quot;, then later that year in the short story collection &quot;Men Without Women&quot;. In 2002, the story was adapted into a 38-minute short film starring Greg Wise,  Emma Griffiths Malin and Benedict Cumberbatch. 

== Summary ==

The story focuses mainly on a conversation between an American man and a young woman, described as a &quot;girl,&quot; at a Spanish train station while waiting for a train to Madrid. The girl compares the nearby hills to white elephants. The pair indirectly discuss an &quot;operation&quot; that the man wants the girl to have, which is implied to be an abortion, that was taboo to talk about.

== Analysis ==
While there is little context or background information about the characters, several scholars have analyzed how the setting influences the story. The expatriate atmosphere is &quot;a motivating factor in character action,&quot; writes Jeffrey Herlihy in &quot;In Paris or Paname: Hemingway’s Expatriate Nationalism&quot;. Setting the piece in Spain &quot;dramatizes the peripatetic subject&quot; and allows the man to discuss abortion outside the &quot;restraints from the behavioral prescriptions of his place of origin.&quot; This use of a foreign setting makes Spain not merely a background but &quot;a catalyst of textual irony&quot; in the story. 

Readers must come to their own conclusions based on the dialogue. This has led to varying interpretations of the story. One point of debate is whether or not the woman decides to get an abortion. Critics like Stanley Renner assert that the details in the story imply that the woman decides to keep the baby: &quot;The logic of the story&#x27;s design enjoins the conclusion that she smiles brightly at the waitress&#x27;s announcement of the train because she is no longer headed in the direction of having the abortion that she has contemplated only with intense distress&quot;. Other critics conclude that the woman ultimately decides to get an abortion. Furthermore, most critics acknowledge that the story has several possible interpretations: &quot;The two organizing questions of the narrative—will they have the abortion or the baby? Will they break up or stay together?—imply four possible outcomes: 1) they will have the abortion and break up; 2) they will have the abortion and stay together; 3) they will have the baby and break up; and 4) they will have the baby and stay together&quot;. There are many essays written which argue for all of these possibilities and more. There is no universal consensus because of the nature of the story; the reader is simply not given much information.

=== Symbolism ===
The description of the valley of Ebro, in the opening paragraph, is often seen as having deeper meanings: &quot;It has long been recognized that the two sides of the valley of the Ebro represent two ways of life, one a sterile perpetuation of the aimless hedonism the couple have been pursuing, the other a participation in life in its full natural sense.&quot; Critics also point to the various positions of the characters, with relation to the train tracks and the valley, to show a wide variety of possible symbolic interpretations.

Doris Lanier writes about the significance of absinthe (which the girl is reminded of when they drink anisette) in the story. Lanier explains the drink &quot;was alluring not only because of its narcotic effects but also because of its reputation as an aphrodisiac.&quot; Lanier asserts that every detail in &quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; is intentionally placed by Hemingway, and that the absinthe could have several possible connotations. She postulates that &quot;the addictive quality of the drink…is meant to emphasize the addictive nature of the couple&#x27;s lifestyle…It is an empty, meaningless existence that revolves around traveling, sex, drinking, looking at things, and having pointless conversations about these things&quot;. Another possible interpretation of the absinthe relates to its appeal and effects. Like the man and woman&#x27;s relationship, it is alluring at first, but &quot;it becomes a destroyer of the child, who is aborted; a destroyer of the girl, who endures the physical and emotional pain of aborting the child she wants; and a destroyer of the couple&#x27;s relationship&quot;. This interpretation assumes the couple have the abortion and end their relationship, as well as that the young woman wants to continue the pregnancy; none of these are certain, due to the ambiguity of the story.

The title &quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; is a symbol within Hemingway&#x27;s short story that requires analysis to depict its meaning and relevance to the story as well. Repetition of words and phrases is a common trait found within Hemingway&#x27;s short story, a habit that is not done without cause. This was done in an attempt to emphasize importance on certain matters, such as he does with the title of the story. Within the story, Hemingway makes &quot;two references to the whiteness of the hills and four to them as white elephants&quot;. The most common belief as to the meaning of this reference has to do with color comparisons used throughout the story. In correlation with the drink &quot;absinthe&quot; as mentioned above, there is believed to be a contrast of joy and sorrow between the black licorice of the alcoholic drink and the whiteness of the hills. This can also be contrasted with the comparison between the white hills and the dry, brown countryside that represents the same joy and sorrow as the former. However, the true meaning of the title does not become fully known until the topic of getting an abortion is revealed between the couple, as the man states, it&#x27;s an &quot;awfully simple operation... not really an operation at all... just to let the air in&quot;. It is then understood that the use of the term &quot;white elephants&quot; may in fact be a reference to the white elephant sale. It&#x27;s a sale put together through the donation of unwanted gifts, making the reader believe that this may be correlating with the act of getting an abortion. It could also mean the literal translation of elephant in the room meaning something painfully obvious that is not to be spoken about or referenced. &quot;Elephant in the room&quot; is a term used mainly by couples having a relationship crisis or difficulty including break-ups, divorce, cheating, marriage, adoption, or abortion. This is viewed differently between the couple. The child is seen &quot;as simply a white elephant to the man&quot; to be rid of, whereas the woman only sees it as this due to the father&#x27;s views.

The final reference to the hills is when the girl contemplates her decision of getting an abortion through the following line, &quot;it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and you&#x27;ll like it?&quot; This is to provide an immediate understanding of the white elephant reference when we learn that the story&#x27;s conflict revolves around an unwanted pregnancy is associated with the ubiquitous white elephant sale. These sales raise money that is worthwhile cause for people to donate unwanted objects. This is shown in &quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; as to the man, the girl is a white elephant with the child.

Another important symbol in the story is the bamboo curtain. Many interpretations see the curtain as a barrier between Jig and the American. Literally, the curtain is a barrier between the American and the girl while he drinks in the bar among other &quot;reasonable people&quot; while the girl sits outside. Figuratively, the beaded curtain separates Jig, a sensitive girl who notices and touches the beads from the American who only acknowledges the drink advertisement and pays no more attention to the curtain than the hills.

David Gilmour points out that the bead curtain has an even more specific symbolism. When Jig takes hold of two strands, the American believes that she views them as a rosary, giving a clue to Jig being Catholic. Gilmour goes on to state that any leap to thinking of Spain, Catholicism, and the abortion as connected ideas is a stretch and if Jig were praying, she would most likely be praying to turn back time so that she may not be entangled with the American. This belief is supported when she states, while holding the two strands, that she wants things to be as they were before. In contrast, Gary Elliott writes that the beaded curtain and its similarity to a rosary lends insight to the girl’s reluctance to go through with the abortion and is almost certainly indicative of her Catholic background. He goes on to say that while the curtain is a physical barrier between the two, it is really her religion, symbolized by the beads, that separates them.

==Dialogue==

&quot;They look like white elephants,&quot; she said. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen one,&quot; the man drank his beer.
&quot;No, you wouldn&#x27;t have.&quot;
&quot;I might have,&quot; the man said. &quot;Just because you say I wouldn&#x27;t have doesn&#x27;t prove anything.&quot;
The girl looked at the bead curtain. &quot;They&#x27;ve painted something on it,&quot; she said. &quot;What does it say?&quot;
&quot;Anis del Toro. It&#x27;s a drink.&quot;
&quot;Can we try it?&quot;
The reader must interpret their dialogue and body language to infer their backgrounds and their attitudes with respect to the situation at hand, and their attitudes toward one another. From the outset of the story, the contentious nature of the couple&#x27;s conversation indicates resentment and unease. Some critics have written that the dialogue is a distillation of the contrasts between stereotypical male and female relationship roles: in the excerpt above, for instance, the woman draws the comparison with white elephants, but the hyper-rational male immediately denies it, dissolving the bit of poetry into objective realism with &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen one.&quot; By saying, &quot;No, you wouldn&#x27;t have&quot; she implies he hadn&#x27;t had a child before, or hadn&#x27;t allowed birth in the past. She also asks his permission to order a drink. Throughout the story, the woman is distant; the American is rational. There may be more serious problems with the relationship than the purely circumstantial. Though the immediate problem is the unwanted pregnancy, the experience has revealed that the relationship is a shallow one. While most critics have espoused relatively straightforward interpretations of the dialogue, a few have argued for alternate scenarios.

== Reception ==
&quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; has been criticized for being anti-feminist; it has also been interpreted as being pro-feminist. The anti-feminist perspective emphasizes the notion that the man dominates the woman in the story, and she ultimately succumbs to his will by getting the abortion. Frederick Busch asserts that the woman &quot;&#x27;buries her way of seeing as she will bury her child.&#x27;&quot; However, critics also argue that the female character makes her own decision in the end, and the story is actually pro-feminist. Stanley Renner claims that &quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; is primarily empathetic towards the female character: &quot;So firmly does the story&#x27;s sympathy side with the girl and her values, so strong is her repugnance toward the idea of abortion, and so critical is the story of the male&#x27;s self-serving reluctance to shoulder the responsibility of the child he has begotten that the reading I have proposed seems the most logical resolution to its conflict.&quot; However, Doris Lanier describes the drink that the woman has as &quot;absinthe,&quot; a narcotic that the man uses to influence the woman&#x27;s mind.

<text>Brodmann areas 41 and 42 are parts of the primary auditory cortex. 

Brodmann area 41 is also known as the anterior transverse temporal area 41 (H). It is a cytoarchitectonic division of the cerebral cortex occupying the anterior transverse temporal gyrus (H) in the bank of the lateral sulcus on the dorsal surface of the temporal lobe. Brodmann area 41 is bounded medially by the parainsular area 52 (H) and laterally by the posterior transverse temporal area 42 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

Brodmann area 42 is also known as the posterior transverse temporal area 42 (H), and is also a subdivision of the temporal lobe. Brodmann area 42 is bounded medially by the anterior transverse temporal area 41 (H) and laterally by the superior temporal area 22 (Brodmann-1909).

==Function==
Brodmann areas 41 and 42 are parts of the primary auditory cortex. This is the first cortical destination of auditory information stemming from the thalamus. Neural activity in this brain part corresponds most strongly with the objective physical properties of a sound.

<doc id="994076" wikidata="Q7248137" url="?curid=994076" title="Professor Branestawm">
<text>Professor Branestawm is a series of thirteen children&#x27;s books written by the English author Norman Hunter. Professor Theophilus Branestawm is depicted throughout the books as the archetypal absent-minded professor and his name is a variant of the word &quot;brainstorm&quot;. The first two books in the series were first published in the 1930s, but the other 11 appeared much later, from 1970 onwards.

==Characters==

Professor Branestawm is always at work in his &quot;Inventory&quot; creating bizarre inventions, all of which either malfunction or work in unanticipated ways, and which lead him into incredible adventures, often accompanied by his friend Colonel Dedshott of the Catapult Cavaliers (soldiers who use catapults as their only weapon), and his housekeeper Mrs Flittersnoop. He lives in Great Pagwell, which is apparently surrounded by other Pagwells (Little Pagwell, Pagwell Heights, Pagwell Gardens, Lower Pagwell, Upper Pagwell, Pagwell Green, Pagwell Centre, Pagwell Market, Pagwell Docks etc.). In &quot;The Professor Borrows a Book&quot;, he manages to lose fourteen different copies of the same book from fourteen different public libraries, and has to cycle frantically between fourteen different Pagwells to renew his books to avoid being fined. In &quot;The Fair at Pagwell Green&quot;, the Professor is mistaken for a waxwork, only because of Colonel Dedshott. The Colonel thought the waxwork to be a frozen professor, so he and Mrs Flittersnoop heated it, melting the waxwork. Meanwhile, the Professor was covered along with all the waxworks when he was lost in thought. He suddenly stopped thinking and when trying to get out of the fair, was thought to be a living waxwork.

The Professor is described in the first book as having, like all great men, simple tastes: &quot;His coat was simply fastened with safety pins because the buttons had simply fallen off. His head was simply bald and it simply shone like anything when the sun caught it.&quot; He has five pairs of spectacles – one for reading, one for writing, one for out of doors, one for looking at you over the top of and a fifth pair for looking for the others on the frequent occasions when they get lost. Other pairs of spectacles are often mentioned.

Mrs Flittersnoop, his housekeeper, causes trouble a few times through her lack of understanding for the Professor&#x27;s genius. In &quot;The Wild Waste Paper&quot;, she throws what seems to be a bottle of cough medicine into the waste bin. The liquid turns out to be the Professor&#x27;s elixir of life, which was in the bottle because cough medicine is the only thing that can stop the stuff dead without actually destroying it. Since the bottle was uncorked to allow air in (nothing can live without air), the waste paper in the bin comes to life. Even when stuck up a pear tree surrounded by giant, predatory bits of waste paper, the Professor retains his scientific detachment, wondering if a carpenter&#x27;s bill would know a saw if it saw one, and if so, whether the gas bill might explode at any moment.

The names of other characters in the books, like the Professor&#x27;s, are puns:

* Mrs Flittersnoop – the Professor&#x27;s housekeeper
* Colonel Dedshott – his best friend
* General Shatterfortz – the Colonel&#x27;s commanding officer
* Commander Hardaport (Retired) – a neighbour of the Professor&#x27;s
* Mr Chintzbitz – a friend of the Colonel&#x27;s who owns a furniture shop
* Dr Mumpzanmeasle – the local doctor

==Plot devices==
Many of the Professor&#x27;s perils result from simple absent-mindedness. In &quot;The Screaming Clocks&quot;, he invents a clock that doesn&#x27;t need winding up, but the omission of an important component (&quot;I forgot to put a little wiggly thing in&quot;) means the clock doesn&#x27;t stop at twelve but continues striking thirteen, fourteen and so forth until it can&#x27;t keep up with itself. In &quot;Burglars!&quot;, the Professor invents an automatic burglar catcher, but forgets his house key, tries to get in the window and is grabbed and trussed up by his own machine so thoroughly that even Mrs Flittersnoop fails to recognise him and bashes him over the head for good measure.

Many of the troubles that the professor experiences are the result of his inventions&#x27; rebelling and showing anthropomorphic personalities. For instance, the phrase &quot;No Branestawm invention was going to stand for that&quot; occurs several times in the series. Branestawm inventions frequently object to anyone&#x27;s using them in ways for which they were not designed. For instance, in a story about the Professor&#x27;s making cuckoo clocks for all his friends, a fight broke out between the clocks, resulting in the destruction of all of them.

==Illustrators==

The first book featuring Professor Branestawm was &quot;The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm&quot;, first published in 1933 and illustrated by W. Heath Robinson. Heath Robinson was famous for his rickety contraptions, and the illustrations were a perfect foil to the outlandish plots of these short stories, each picture typically featuring the professor&#x27;s unfeasibly large forehead. The original book contained a section called &quot;seventy-six illustrations by W. Heath Robinson&quot;, each with evocative titles such as &quot;A telescope of his own invention&quot; or &quot;With nothing on at all but a big smile&quot; (referring to a picture of an &quot;extra specially young&quot; professor).

The sequel was &quot;Professor Branestawm&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;, published 1937. The first edition was illustrated by James Arnold, with George Adamson illustrating the 1966 reissue. Adamson went on to illustrate &quot;The Peculiar Triumph of Professor Branestawm&quot;, &quot;Professor Branestawm up the Pole&quot; and the Puffin edition of &quot;Professor Branestawm&#x27;s Great Revolution&quot;, as well as a Branestawm story in the &quot;Puffin Annual&quot; and two in &quot;Puffin Post&quot;. &quot;The Peculiar Triumph of Professor Branestawm&quot; with Adamson&#x27;s illustrations was reissued by Red Fox Classics (Random House) in 2003.

== Adaptations ==
Later &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; writer Trevor Preston adapted the first two books into a seven-episode television sitcom for Thames Television starring Jack Woolgar as Branestawm, entitled &quot;The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm&quot;, broadcast from 10 July to 28 August 1969. Episodes were directed by Pamela Lonsdale (nos. 1–5) and Voytek (nos. 6–7).

In 2001 five stories were adapted for BBC Radio 4, with the Professor voiced by John Fortune.

In 2014, a BBC hour-long television film adaptation of Hunter&#x27;s books, written by Charlie Higson and starring Harry Hill as Professor Branestawm, was broadcast on Christmas Eve. Filming for this took place in Shere, Surrey in early October 2014, then Wallingford in mid October, and included David Mitchell, Simon Day, Ben Miller and Miranda Richardson. In 2015, a sequel, also an hour-long, entitled &quot;Professor Branestawm Returns&quot; aired on Christmas Eve at 5.20pm on BBC One.

<doc id="994080" wikidata="Q1069344" url="?curid=994080" title="Balk">
<text>In baseball, a balk is a set of illegal motions or actions that a pitcher may make. Most of these violations involve pitchers pretending to pitch when they have no intention of doing so. In games played under the Official Baseball Rules that govern professional play in the United States and Canada, a balk results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a balk may be wholly or partially disregarded. In the United States, under the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS Baseball Rules), a balk results in an immediate dead ball. In the event a balk is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat with the previous count. The balk rule in Major League Baseball was introduced in 1898.

According to the Official Baseball Rules: &quot;Umpires should bear in mind that the purpose of the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately deceiving the base runner.&quot;

==Balk actions==
A pitcher is restricted to a certain set of motions and one of two basic pitching positions before and during a pitch. If these regulations are violated with one or more runners on base, an umpire may call a balk. The batter at home plate does not advance on a balk.

With a runner on base and the pitcher on or astride (with one leg on each side of) the rubber, under Official Baseball Rules, it is a balk when the pitcher:
* Switches pitching position from the windup to the set (or vice versa) without properly disengaging the rubber
* While on the rubber, makes a motion associated with a pitch and does not complete the delivery
* When pitching from the set position, fails to make a complete stop with his hands together before beginning to pitch
* Throws from the mound to a base without stepping toward (gaining distance in the direction of that base)
* Throws or feints a throw from the rubber to an unoccupied base, unless a play is imminent
* Steps or feints from the rubber to first or third base without completing the throw
* Delivers a quick return, a pitch thrown right after receiving the ball back, with intent to catch the batter off-guard
* Drops the ball while on the rubber, even if by accident, if the ball does not subsequently cross a foul line
* Unnecessarily delays the game 
* Pitches while facing away from the batter
* After bringing his hands together on the rubber, separates them except in making a pitch or a throw
* Stands on or astride the rubber without the ball, or mimics a pitch without the ball
* Attempts to throw to a fielder in a spot not directly at a base
* Delivers a pitch during a squeeze play or a steal of home, if the catcher or some other player steps on or in front of home plate without possession of the ball, or touches the batter (or the bat). The ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, the pitcher is charged with a balk, and the run scores
With the addition of new pace-of-play rules introduced for the 2023 season, a pitcher is charged with a balk if he attempts a pickoff more than twice in a single at-bat without recording an out, and without the runner advancing.

Under NFHS Rules, a balk occurs when

* There is any feinting toward the batter or first base, or any dropping of the ball (even though accidental) and the ball does not cross a foul line.
* The pitcher fails to step with the non-pivot foot directly toward a base (occupied or unoccupied) when throwing or feinting there in an attempt to put out, or drive back a runner; or throwing or feinting to any unoccupied base when it is not an attempt to put out or drive back a runner.
* An illegal pitch from any position.
* Failing to pitch to the batter in a continuous motion immediately after any movement of any part of the body such as he habitually uses in his delivery
* Taking a hand off the ball while in a set position (unless he pitches to the batter or throws toward a base or he steps toward and feints a throw to second or third base)
* Failing to pitch to the batter when the entire non-pivot foot passes behind the perpendicular plane of the back edge of the pitcher’s plate, except when feinting or throwing to second base in an attempt to put out a runner
* The pitcher makes a movement naturally associated with pitching and/or places his feet on the pitcher&#x27;s plate without the ball. 

The pitcher&#x27;s acts of spitting on the ball, defacing or altering the ball, rubbing the ball on the clothing or body, or applying a foreign substance to the ball are not balks; however, it will result in the pitcher&#x27;s ejection from the game if caught.

==Clarifications==
A pitcher was allowed to feint toward third (or second) base, and then turn and throw or feint to first base if the pitcher&#x27;s pivot foot disengaged the rubber after the initial feint. This is called the &quot;fake to third, throw to first&quot; play. However, Major League Baseball classified this as a balk beginning with the 2013 season.

If no runners are on base and the pitcher commits an otherwise balkable action, there generally is no penalty. However, delivering a quick return or pitching while off the rubber (which constitute balks when runners are on base) results in a ball being called with the bases empty. If the pitcher commits an act confusing to the batter with nobody on, stops their delivery, or otherwise violates, play is restarted without penalty and time is called. If a pitcher repeatedly commits illegal actions without runners on base, they may be subject to ejection for persistently violating the rules.

If, during an attempt to execute the &quot;hidden ball trick&quot; (where the defensive team deceives the runner(s) as to the ball&#x27;s location while the play is live), the pitcher stands on the rubber prior to the fielder revealing the ball and applying the tag, the runner is not out. Instead, it is a balk, with all runners on base being awarded their next base.

==Common misconceptions==
&quot;Catcher&#x27;s balk&quot; is not a term in the official rules, but is sometimes used to describe an atypical situation relating to an intentional walk: if the catcher is not completely within the catcher&#x27;s box when the pitcher releases the ball during delivery, it is a violation. The balk is still charged to the pitcher, because such a pitch is defined as a &quot;Pitcher Illegal Action.&quot;

A pitcher is not required to step off the rubber before throwing to an occupied base in a pick-off attempt. With his pivot foot in contact with the rubber in either the windup position or the &quot;set&quot; position, the pitcher may either: 1) deliver the ball to the batter: 2) throw to a base for a pickoff; or 3) step off the rubber.

MLB rules state that: &quot;Pitchers shall take signs from the catcher while in contact with the pitcher’s plate&quot; (the rubber), but the rules do not describe the infraction as a balk.

==Major League Baseball balk records==
Steve Carlton had 90 balks during his major league career.

The major league record in a single season is held by Dave Stewart, who had 16 balks in 1988 while pitching for the Oakland Athletics.

The major league record for the most balks in one game is held by Bob Shaw, who had five balks in a May 4, 1963, game while pitching for the Milwaukee Braves against the Chicago Cubs. Four of the five balks came when the Cubs&#x27; Billy Williams was on base: one in the first inning, then three more in the third inning. In the latter frame, Shaw walked Williams, and then proceeded to balk him to second, third and home. Shaw&#x27;s balks were blamed on his difficulty adjusting to a then-new point of emphasis in the rules: umpires were told to strictly enforce the section of the balk rule that required the pitcher, when going from the stretch to the set position, to come to a complete stop with his hands together for one full second before pitching. The rule had been virtually ignored before.

Knuckleballer Charlie Hough was once called for nine balks in a single major league exhibition game, occurring in March 1988. Hough was called for seven balks in a single inning of the game, as umpires set out to &quot;enforce a full set position&quot; for the coming season.

On September 27, 2022, Miami Marlins reliever Richard Bleier was called for three balks in a row by first-base umpire John Tumpane, all while facing New York Mets batter Pete Alonso. Bleier had given up a single, and was then called for three balks while facing Alonso, balking the runner home. Marlins Manager Don Mattingly was ejected for arguing the third balk. After Alonso grounded out for the third out of the inning, Bleier was also ejected for continuing to argue the balks. Until that point, Bleier had never had a balk called against him in his seven-year major league career, over the course of 303 games. This instance tied the record for most balks in an inning and for most balks in a single at bat. CBS Sports opined: &quot;Some balks are obvious. Those are not... You almost have to be looking for a reason to call a balk to ring Bleier up on that motion three -- again, three! -- times in a single inning.&quot;

==Notable balks==

During the 1947 World Series (New York Yankees vs. Brooklyn Dodgers) Spec Shea dropped the ball trying to pick off Jackie Robinson at first base; after at least one other attempt, he dropped the ball and umpire Babe Pinelli waved Robinson to second base.

A famous balk came in the first All-Star Game of 1961, when strong winds at Candlestick Park caused pitcher Stu Miller to sway erratically and be called for a balk. This story is often exaggerated in re-tellings of baseball lore, some having Miller being blown off the pitching mound.

The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Texas Rangers on June 18, 2015, when Rangers relief pitcher Keone Kela committed a balk in the bottom of the ninth inning of a tie game with Dodger Enrique Hernández at third base. There have been at least 25 such walk-off balks (or &quot;balk-offs&quot;) in major league history since 1914. 

The Kansas City Royals won two games in the 2023 season via a balk-off. The first was on August 1 vs. the New York Mets in the bottom of the 10th inning when relief pitcher Josh Walker balked before throwing a single pitch, scoring MJ Melendez and resulting in a 7-6 victory for the Royals. The Royals&#x27; second balk-off victory came 36 days later in a game against the Chicago White Sox on September 5 when Gregory Santos balked with 2 outs in the 9th inning and the bases loaded to score Maikel García; coincidentally, this game also ended with a score of 7-6. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the 2023 Royals are the only team in the Live Ball Era to have multiple balk-off wins in a single season.

On June 14, 2019, Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen intentionally balked during a game with the Chicago Cubs. With the Dodgers leading, 5–3, and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, the Cubs&#x27; Jason Heyward was on second base. Concerned that a runner at second base could possibly steal signs, Jansen intentionally balked, advancing the runner to third base. Jansen then struck out batter Víctor Caratini for the final out of the game. Other intentional balks, while rare, have subsequently occurred in MLB.

<doc id="994085" wikidata="Q3477182" url="?curid=994085" title="Second lady">
<text>Second lady and second gentleman are honorary titles often used in reference to the spouse of a vice president, or spouse of a lieutenant governor or other second-ranked government official. The title is styled after first lady or first gentleman, which are used to describe the spouse of a president or governor. In discussing both spouses, they may be referred to as the second couple, and if they have children, they are known collectively as the second family. 

The expression &quot;second lady in the land&quot; has also been used to refer to the second-highest ranking female in a monarchy, such as a crown princess if there is a queen. 

== United States ==

=== Spouse of the vice president ===
The role of the second lady is unpaid and not formally defined. The wife of the vice president of the United States was traditionally expected to serve as a hostess and appear at society functions. As the Office of the Vice President itself gained power and influence, the spouse of the vice president also became more visible. Second Lady Lady Bird Johnson often replaced First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy when she withdrew from public appearances. Pat Nixon, wife of Vice President Richard Nixon, was the first second spouse to add a great deal of substance to the role, traveling independently of the vice president and setting her own event schedule. Historian Kate Andersen Brower wrote, &quot;she helped to define this nebulous role for an entire generation of women who would succeed her.&quot; Subsequent second ladies also had their own issues which they advocated, such as education reform and literacy.

==== Usage of title ====
Writers including William Safire and Jeff McQuain have suggested that use of the term &quot;second lady&quot; to refer to the wife of the vice president of the United States did not become more commonplace until the 1980s. However, in 2017, &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Philip Bump argued that use of the phrase &quot;second lady&quot; could be traced back as early as the 1860s, strengthening in popularity around 1892, and &quot;spiking&quot; around the turn of the 20th century, according to his research using the Google Ngram tool.

In 1996, Tipper Gore wrote that the spouse of the vice president did not have an official title, and that people were often unsure about how to introduce her, saying: &quot;Sometimes they call me the Second Lady. Sometimes they refer to me as the Second First Lady. Once I was even introduced as the Second Lady of Vice.&quot; In 2008, when a Fox News host remarked that calling Lynne Cheney the Second Lady of the United States was &quot;weird&quot;, Cheney acknowledged, &quot;Well, it is, a little, but it&#x27;s ok.&quot; The abbreviation for the Second Lady of the United States is SLOTUS.

==== Second gentleman ====
In 2021, Merriam-Webster added the term &quot;second gentleman&quot; to its dictionary, in light of Doug Emhoff becoming the first male spouse of an American vice president. Emhoff, who followed Biden&#x27;s example and started teaching entertainment law at Georgetown University at the same time he assumed his ceremonial role as Second Gentleman of the United States, has acknowledged the many generations of women who had served in the role &quot;without much accolade&quot;, and vowed to continue building on &quot;their legacy of progress&quot;. The abbreviation for Second Gentleman of the United States is SGOTUS.

=== Spouse of the lieutenant governor ===

At the state level, second lady or second gentleman is used to refer to the spouse of the lieutenant governor. In political fiction, novelist and journalist Jim Lehrer referred to Jackie, wife of fictional Lieutenant Governor &quot;One-Eyed Mack&quot;, as the Second Lady of Oklahoma from the late 1980s.

In 2020, Second Lady Giselle Fetterman told CNN that she prefers the titular acronym SLOP over the more &quot;stuffy&quot; title of Second Lady of Pennsylvania. Andrew Rosati of &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; said in 2022 that Fetterman, a former undocumented immigrant to the U.S. from Brazil, has &quot;transformed the ceremonial role of Second Lady of Pennsylvania...into a megaphone for the marginalized&quot;. 

== Other countries ==

=== Spouse of the vice president ===

In Brazil, the second lady (&quot;Segunda-dama do Brasil&quot;), is the wife of the vice president and resides with him at Jaburu&#x27;s Palace.

In Colombia, the second lady or second gentleman is the equivalent of the spouse or partner of the vice president of Colombia who, together with the vice president, resides in the Vice Presidential House.

In Ghana, an emoluments committee set up in June 2019 recommended that the spouse of the vice president should receive compensation equivalent to the salary of a cabinet minister-MP, along with the spouse of the president. Although the recommendation was approved by Parliament in 2021, both the first lady and Second Lady Samira Bawumia rejected the proposed payments and promised to refund the allowances they had been paid since 2017, following public backlash against the emoluments. In opposing their monthly salaries, the Trades Union Congress acknowledged the role of the first and second ladies, particularly in supporting women&#x27;s rights, children&#x27;s rights, and other causes promoting social and economic development, but stressed that they were not assigned official duties according to the Constitution of Ghana or other national laws.

In Nigeria, former Second Lady Titi Abubakar, the wife of Vice President Atiku Abubakar (1999–2007), used her role to combat human trafficking. During her tenure, she founded WOTCLEF (Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication Foundation), and became the first civilian in Nigerian history to propose draft legislation.

=== Other uses ===
In the United Kingdom, Camilla Parker Bowles was said to become the &quot;second lady in the land&quot;, ranking second only to Queen Elizabeth II, upon marrying Charles, Prince of Wales, in 2005. In 1958, &quot;The Times&quot; noted that the duties of an American second lady at home in Washington, D.C., &quot;have no exact counterpart in England&quot;.

In France, Penelope Fillon, the British-born wife of former Prime Minister François Fillon, was nicknamed &quot;France&#x27;s second lady&quot; in the media. However, &quot;France Magazine&quot; reported in 2008 that Fillon was trying to play down the role, which had traditionally remained outside the limelight.

<text>Brian Christopher Lawler (January 10, 1972 – July 29, 2018) was an American professional wrestler. He is best remembered for his career in the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), where he performed as &quot;Too Sexy&quot; Brian Christopher and Grand Master Sexay. Lawler was a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion as part of Too Cool with Scotty 2 Hotty, and won 44 titles within the United States Wrestling Association, the promotion formerly co-owned by his father, professional wrestler Jerry Lawler.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== United States Wrestling Association (1988–1997) ===
Lawler began his career as one half of the masked tag team &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; with Tony Williams under the individual ring names of Nebula (Lawler) and Quasar (Williams). After they were unmasked, Brian continued to wrestle in the United States Wrestling Association under the name &quot;Too Sexy&quot; Brian Christopher. He feuded with wrestlers such as Jeff Jarrett, Bill Dundee, Tom Prichard, and The Moondogs, and his father Jerry Lawler. Among his partners were The Rock (known as Flex Kavana at the time), Tony Williams (as the New Kids), Doug Gilbert, Scotty Flamingo, and &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; Eddie Gilbert.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1997–2001) ===
Lawler, still known as Brian Christopher, joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1997 and began competing in the light heavyweight division. Taka Michinoku defeated him in the finals of a tournament for the Light Heavyweight Championship. In mid-1998, he started teaming up with Scott &quot;Too Hot&quot; Taylor to form the tag team &quot;Too Much&quot;. When he was known as Brian Christopher, his father Jerry Lawler would talk him up as being superior to all the other Light Heavyweights but never publicly acknowledged that Brian was his son, although after Paul Heyman revealed that fact on &quot;Raw&quot;, Jim Ross (Jerry&#x27;s broadcast partner) always hinted at it. Often a running joke was that someone (usually a commentator) would mention their relationship, which led to both of them adamantly denying that they were related.

On the June 13, 1999, episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Brian and Scott adopted the ring names Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty, returning after a hiatus. Their tag team was renamed Too Cool, and they were later joined by Rikishi. They defeated Edge &amp; Christian in May 2000 on &quot;Raw&quot; to become the Tag Team Champions. They were even occasionally involved with top-card feuds, notably being enemies to the McMahon-Helmsley Faction and their associates, such as The Radicalz, Edge and Christian, and T &amp; A. The trio&#x27;s run ended in late 2000 when Rikishi was revealed as the man behind the wheel of the car that hit Stone Cold Steve Austin at Survivor Series. Shortly after, Rikishi turned on his teammates. While Scotty was sidelined in 2001 with a broken ankle, Lawler formed a short-lived tag team with Steve Blackman. In June 2001, he was released from the WWF for illegally conveying drugs across the Canada–United States border.

=== World Wrestling All-Stars (2001–2002) ===
In November and December 2001, Lawler (as Brian Christopher) wrestled in the United Kingdom and Ireland for World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA). On February 24, 2002, at the WWA pay per view &quot;The Revolution&quot; in the United States, Lawler wrestled WWA Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett for the title, but lost. In April 2002, at the WWA pay-per-view &quot;The Eruption&quot; in Australia, Lawler teamed with Ernest Miller to defeat Buff Bagwell and Stevie Ray.

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action (2002–2003) ===
From 2002 until 2003, he worked for NWA Total Nonstop Action as Brian Lawler. He formed a group called Next Generation with fellow second generation stars David Flair and Erik Watts. They were involved in a rivalry with Dusty Rhodes and harassed him with a replica of the NWA World Title belt that he wore when he was champion.

=== Return to World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2004–2014) ===
Lawler returned to WWE as Grand Master Sexay on April 12, 2004, but he was released the following month.

On the March 14, 2011 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lawler returned to the WWE as a heel in a segment between Michael Cole and his father, Jerry Lawler, where Brian would side with Cole, saying that he felt that Jerry never cared for him and that he was ashamed to be his son. Lawler indirectly agreed, telling Brian that he was a bigger screw-up than Charlie Sheen. 

Lawler returned to the WWE on January 6, 2014, appearing on the &quot;Old School&quot; edition of &quot;Raw&quot; and reuniting with Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty to take on 3MB in a six-man tag team match. His team was successful in winning. He made what would be his final WWE appearance, on NXT Arrival in February 2014 as part of Too Cool in a losing effort as mystery opponents to The Ascension, who defended their NXT Tag Team Championship.

=== Independent circuit (2007–2017) ===

In July 2007, Christopher reunited with Scotty 2 Hotty at the UWF Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express Tag Team Tournament, after Scotty was released by WWE. 

In 2009, he worked for the Hulkamania Let the Battle Begin Tour in Australia where he teamed with Rikishi. 

In 2014, Christopher and Scotty 2 Hotty continued teaming together in the independent circuit, England and Germany until 2016. 

On the weekend of September 22 and 23, 2017, Christopher teamed with his dad and Doug Gilbert for two matches to Terry Funk and The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express for Big Time Wrestling in Raleigh, North Carolina and Spartanburg, South Carolina, both resulting in a loss. 

Christopher&#x27;s last match was on November 11, 2017 where he defeated Donnie Primetime for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Canton, Georgia.

==Personal life==
Lawler was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, in stark contrast to his father, who is a diehard Cleveland Browns fan. According to his brother Kevin, Lawler was buried in a Steelers-themed casket with his ring name.

Lawler was arrested in February 2009 for disorderly conduct. On June 26, 2009, he was arrested for public intoxication just before 3 a.m. According to the police report, he &quot;became very belligerent&quot; once in custody and threatened the police officer who arrested him. On July 13, 2009, he was jailed for 30 days after failing to attend an in-patient treatment center as part of his plea agreement.

==Death==
Around 1 a.m. EDT on July 7, 2018, Lawler was again jailed for driving under the influence, and for evading police. On the early morning of July 29, 2018, Lawler was found hanging in a cell at the Hardeman County Jail and was observed to be brain dead. His life support was disabled a few hours after his father Jerry Lawler had arrived to the hospital to see him. Lawler was pronounced dead at around 4:40 p.m. EDT at the age of 46. 

On the one year anniversary of his death, Jerry Lawler filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Hardeman County, Hardeman County Sheriff John Doolen, and others for allegedly failing to protect Lawler. He alleged that Doolen had personally promised to &quot;keep an eye&quot; on Lawler after he was incarcerated.

<text>Mindi Abair ( ; born May 23, 1969) is an American saxophonist, vocalist, author, and National Trustee for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that puts on the Grammy Awards show.

Her solo career has produced ten No. 1 radio singles, two No. 1 Billboard Jazz CDs, and four more solo CDs that have landed No. 5 and above on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Charts. She was the featured saxophonist for the 2011 and 2012 seasons of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and performed with the rock band Aerosmith. Abair&#x27;s recordings have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards.

== Early life ==
She acted as drum major of her high school marching band in her junior and senior years at Northside Christian School in St. Petersburg. As a senior in high school, she won the first chair alto saxophone for the Florida All-State Jazz Band. Abair spent her first year of college on a full scholarship at the University of North Florida, a jazz program started by Rich Matteson. She transferred to Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, attending on a scholarship and studying saxophone with Joe Viola and George Garzone. Abair graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1991 with a degree in Woodwind Performance. She formed her first band in college.

== Career ==
=== Performances and releases ===
In 1991, after college, Abair moved to Los Angeles, California, where she began booking her band into clubs, coffee shops and hotels. She played solo on the street at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California and garnered the attention of jazz keyboardist Bobby Lyle, who hired her to record on his &quot;Power of Touch&quot; CD and tour with him. Her touring opportunities expanded over the next decade, as she toured as a saxophonist/singer and keyboardist with Adam Sandler, John Tesh, Jonathan Butler, Teena Marie, Rick Braun as well. Abair was featured on saxophone in the Go West video &quot;Tell Me&quot;. In 1996, she appeared on Adam Sandler&#x27;s HBO Special and recorded on his platinum CD &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name?&quot; playing the saxophone solo on &quot;The Lonesome Kicker&quot; and singing on various tracks.

In 1999, Abair joined the Backstreet Boys for their Millennium World Tour, and spent the next year and a half as their saxophonist, keyboardist and percussionist. She assembled Mandy Moore&#x27;s first band and acted as musical director, keyboardist, background singer and percussionist for many of Moore&#x27;s first television appearances and shows.

When not touring, Abair released her first complete solo album, &quot;Always and Never the Same&quot;, an all-vocal pop record, independently. Abair performed in local Los Angeles rock clubs to promote the record, in addition to her touring with the Backstreet Boys.

In 2003, Abair signed to Verve Records and released the album &quot;It Just Happens That Way&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. 2004&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait for Christmas,&quot; the title track to her Christmas album of the same name, became a regional hit, particularly in Buffalo, New York, where both incarnations of WTSS have included the record among their Christmas music playlists.

In 2004, Abair released &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz charts. She followed that with &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; in 2006, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart and remained in the top 20 for 45 weeks. Her songs &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Bloom&quot; hit No. 1 on R&amp;R.

Abair signed to Concord Records in 2007 and released her genre breaking &quot;Stars&quot; in 2008 which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. Her single &quot;Stars&quot; (co-written and produced by Matthew Hager) charted at No. 29 Adult Contemporary R&amp;R simultaneously with her single &quot;Smile&quot; which reached No. 1 on the R&amp;R jazz airplay charts. She released &quot;Hi-Fi Stereo&quot; in 2010 which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. The album spawned the No. 1 hit &quot;Be Beautiful&quot; written by David Ryan Harris.

The album &quot;Summer Horns&quot;, a collaboration with Dave Koz, Gerald Albright, and Richard Elliot, was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

On May 27, 2014, Abair released &quot;Wild Heart&quot; on Concord Records imprint, Heads Up International. The record debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz chart and No. 152 on the Billboard Top 200. The record, which included collaborations with the late Gregg Allman, Joe Perry and Trombone Shorty, was nominated for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album in the 2015 Grammy Awards.

Abair received the Mad Skills Award at the third annual She Rocks at NAMM Show on January 24, 2015. Held in Anaheim, California, the event was founded by the Women&#x27;s International Music Network.

In 2015, after working with Randy Jacobs (founder of The Boneshakers) on the tour for &quot;Wild Heart&quot;, he and Abair decided to form Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers, which includes Mindi Abair (saxophone, vocals), Randy Jacobs (guitar, vocals), Sweet Pea Atkinson (vocals), Rodney Lee (keyboards), Derek Frank (bass, vocals), and Third Richardson (drums, vocals). In late 2015, they released a live album &quot;Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers Live in Seattle&quot; via Pledge Music and HeadsUp, which featured a performance from Seattle&#x27;s Dimitriou&#x27;s Jazz Alley in February 2015. In summer 2017, the group announced their first studio project via Randy Jacobs&#x27; website. Recorded over five days at EastWest Studios with producer Kevin Shirley, &quot;The EastWest Sessions&quot;, included 11 blues and rock tracks, was released on September 15, 2017. Joe Bonamassa and Fantastic Negrito were featured guests. The album debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Albums Chart on the week of October 7, 2017.

&quot;Pretty Good for a Girl,&quot; a tongue-in-cheek track co-written by Abair and Jacobs for the album, inspired Abair to launch the web platform PrettyGoodForAGirl.net. The goal of the website is to celebrate exceptional women and turn &quot;pretty good for a girl&quot; into a phrase of empowerment.

In October 2018, Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers released their first blues rock holiday album, &quot;All I Got For Christmas Is The Blues&quot;. It debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Albums Chart, number 1 on the RMR Holiday Album and Song Chart and number 13 on Sirius XM Bluesville. It featured four original songs including &quot;All I Got For Christmas Is The Blues&quot; and five holiday classics including &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;.

In June 2019, Abair and The Boneshakers released &quot;No Good Deed.&quot; It debuted at number 3 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Albums Chart.
=== Radio host ===
In 2007, Abair took over the nationally syndicated radio program &quot;Chill with Chris Botti&quot; which he had hosted for two years. The name changed to &quot;Chill With Mindi Abair,&quot; which she hosted from 2007 to 2015. The focus of the program was chill out music.

=== Television appearances ===
Abair featured on the 2011 &quot;American Idol&quot; season as a soloist with Paul McDonald and Casey Abrams and playing behind contestants Jacob Lusk and Haley Reinhart. Steven Tyler remarked to McDonald after her debut on the show &quot;Forget you, who&#x27;s your sax player?&quot; Abair was featured on the 2012 &quot;American Idol&quot; season, performing with Phillip Phillips and Joshua Ledet. Abair appeared with Phillips six times as a featured saxophonist, performing the songs &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; originally by Usher, &quot;Disease&quot; originally by Matchbox Twenty, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival, &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; originally by Billy Joel, &quot;In The Midnight Hour&quot; originally by Wilson Pickett and &quot;Give A Little More&quot; originally by Maroon 5. She was also part of the selected brass section for Ledet&#x27;s performance of &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; originally by James Brown. Tyler was so impressed with Abair that he invited her to join Aerosmith on the summer leg of their 2012 world tour playing sax and singing backing vocals.

She filled in as the saxophonist with the CBS Orchestra on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on April 3 and 4, 2012. She sat in with the band again on July 29, 2014, and she also performed her original songs &quot;Wild Heart&quot; and &quot;Train.&quot;

Abair has also appeared on &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; and more than once on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

<text>The auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and many other vertebrates. It is a part of the auditory system, performing basic and higher functions in hearing, such as possible relations to language switching. It is located bilaterally, roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes – in humans, curving down and onto the medial surface, on the superior temporal plane, within the lateral sulcus and comprising parts of the transverse temporal gyri, and the superior temporal gyrus, including the planum polare and planum temporale (roughly Brodmann areas 41 and 42, and partially 22).

The auditory cortex takes part in the spectrotemporal, meaning involving time and frequency, analysis of the inputs passed on from the ear. The cortex then filters and passes on the information to the dual stream of speech processing. The auditory cortex&#x27;s function may help explain why particular brain damage leads to particular outcomes. For example, unilateral destruction, in a region of the auditory pathway above the cochlear nucleus, results in slight hearing loss, whereas bilateral destruction results in cortical deafness.

==Structure==
The auditory cortex was previously subdivided into primary (A1) and secondary (A2) projection areas and further association areas. The modern divisions of the auditory cortex are the core (which includes primary auditory cortex, A1), the belt (secondary auditory cortex, A2), and the parabelt (tertiary auditory cortex, A3). The belt is the area immediately surrounding the core; the parabelt is adjacent to the lateral side of the belt.

Besides receiving input from the ears via lower parts of the auditory system, it also transmits signals back to these areas and is interconnected with other parts of the cerebral cortex. Within the core (A1), its structure preserves tonotopy, the orderly representation of frequency, due to its ability to map low to high frequencies corresponding to the apex and base, respectively, of the cochlea.

Data about the auditory cortex has been obtained through studies in rodents, cats, macaques, and other animals. In humans, the structure and function of the auditory cortex has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography.

===Development===
Like many areas in the neocortex, the functional properties of the adult primary auditory cortex (A1) are highly dependent on the sounds encountered early in life. This has been best studied using animal models, especially cats and rats. In the rat, exposure to a single frequency during postnatal day (P) 11 to 13 can cause a 2-fold expansion in the representation of that frequency in A1. Importantly, the change is persistent, in that it lasts throughout the animal&#x27;s life, and specific, in that the same exposure outside of that period causes no lasting change in the tonotopy of A1. Sexual dimorphism within the auditory cortex can be seen in humans between males in females through the planum temporale, encompassing Wernicke&#x27;s region, for the planum temporale within males has been observed to have a larger planum temporale volume on average, reflecting previous studies discussing interactions between sex hormones and asymmetrical brain development.

== Function ==
As with other primary sensory cortical areas, auditory sensations reach perception only if received and processed by a cortical area. Evidence for this comes from lesion studies in human patients who have sustained damage to cortical areas through tumors or strokes, or from animal experiments in which cortical areas were deactivated by surgical lesions or other methods. Damage to the auditory cortex in humans leads to a loss of any awareness of sound, but an ability to react reflexively to sounds remains as there is a great deal of subcortical processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain.

Neurons in the auditory cortex are organized according to the frequency of sound to which they respond best. Neurons at one end of the auditory cortex respond best to low frequencies; neurons at the other respond best to high frequencies. There are multiple auditory areas (much like the multiple areas in the visual cortex), which can be distinguished anatomically and on the basis that they contain a complete &quot;frequency map.&quot; The purpose of this frequency map (known as a tonotopic map) likely reflects the fact that the cochlea is arranged according to sound frequency. The auditory cortex is involved in tasks such as identifying and segregating &quot;auditory objects&quot; and identifying the location of a sound in space. For example, it has been shown that A1 encodes complex and abstract aspects of auditory stimuli without encoding their &quot;raw&quot; aspects like frequency content, presence of a distinct sound or its echoes.

Human brain scans indicated that a peripheral part of this brain region is active when trying to identify musical pitch. Individual cells consistently get excited by sounds at specific frequencies, or multiples of that frequency.

The auditory cortex plays an important yet ambiguous role in hearing. When the auditory information passes into the cortex, the specifics of what exactly takes place are unclear. There is a large degree of individual variation in the auditory cortex, as noted by English biologist James Beament, who wrote, &quot;The cortex is so complex that the most we may ever hope for is to understand it in principle, since the evidence we already have suggests that no two cortices work in precisely the same way.&quot;

In the hearing process, multiple sounds are transduced simultaneously. The role of the auditory system is to decide which components form the sound link. Many have surmised that this linkage is based on the location of sounds. However, there are numerous distortions of sound when reflected off different media, which makes this thinking unlikely. The auditory cortex forms groupings based on fundamentals; in music, for example, this would include harmony, timing, and pitch.

The primary auditory cortex lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe and extends into the lateral sulcus and the transverse temporal gyri (also called &quot;Heschl&#x27;s gyri&quot;). Final sound processing is then performed by the parietal and frontal lobes of the human cerebral cortex. Animal studies indicate that auditory fields of the cerebral cortex receive ascending input from the auditory thalamus and that they are interconnected on the same and on the opposite cerebral hemispheres.

The auditory cortex is composed of fields that differ from each other in both structure and function. The number of fields varies in different species, from as few as 2 in rodents to as many as 15 in the rhesus monkey. The number, location, and organization of fields in the human auditory cortex are not known at this time. What is known about the human auditory cortex comes from a base of knowledge gained from studies in mammals, including primates, used to interpret electrophysiological tests and functional imaging studies of the brain in humans.

When each instrument of a symphony orchestra or jazz band plays the same note, the quality of each sound is different, but the musician perceives each note as having the same pitch. The neurons of the auditory cortex of the brain are able to respond to pitch. Studies in the marmoset monkey have shown that pitch-selective neurons are located in a cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex. This location of a pitch-selective area has also been identified in recent functional imaging studies in humans.

The primary auditory cortex is subject to modulation by numerous neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, which has been shown to decrease cellular excitability in all layers of the temporal cortex. alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation, by norepinephrine, decreases glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at AMPA receptors.

=== Relationship to the auditory system ===
The auditory cortex is the most highly organized processing unit of sound in the brain. This cortex area is the neural crux of hearing, and—in humans—language and music. The auditory cortex is divided into three separate parts: the primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortex. These structures are formed concentrically around one another, with the primary cortex in the middle and the tertiary cortex on the outside.

The primary auditory cortex is organized, which means that neighboring cells in the cortex respond to neighboring frequencies. Tonotopic mapping is preserved throughout most of the audition circuit. The primary auditory cortex receives direct input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and thus is thought to identify the fundamental elements of music, such as pitch and loudness.

An evoked response study of congenitally deaf kittens used local field potentials to measure cortical plasticity in the auditory cortex. These kittens were stimulated and measured against a control (an un-stimulated congenitally deaf cat (CDC)) and normal hearing cats. The field potentials measured for artificially stimulated CDC were eventually much stronger than that of a normal hearing cat. This finding accords with a study by Eckart Altenmuller, in which it was observed that students who received musical instruction had greater cortical activation than those who did not.

The auditory cortex has distinct responses to sounds in the gamma band. When subjects are exposed to three or four cycles of a 40 hertz click, an abnormal spike appears in the EEG data, which is not present for other stimuli. The spike in neuronal activity correlating to this frequency is not restrained to the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex. It has been theorized that gamma frequencies are resonant frequencies of certain areas of the brain and appear to affect the visual cortex as well. Gamma band activation (25 to 100 Hz) has been shown to be present during the perception of sensory events and the process of recognition. In a 2000 study by Kneif and colleagues, subjects were presented with eight musical notes to well-known tunes, such as &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; and &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;. Randomly, the sixth and seventh notes were omitted and an electroencephalogram, as well as a magnetoencephalogram were each employed to measure the neural results. Specifically, the presence of gamma waves, induced by the auditory task at hand, were measured from the temples of the subjects. The omitted stimulus response (OSR) was located in a slightly different position; 7 mm more anterior, 13 mm more medial and 13 mm more superior in respect to the complete sets. The OSR recordings were also characteristically lower in gamma waves as compared to the complete musical set. The evoked responses during the sixth and seventh omitted notes are assumed to be imagined, and were characteristically different, especially in the right hemisphere. The right auditory cortex has long been shown to be more sensitive to tonality (high spectral resolution), while the left auditory cortex has been shown to be more sensitive to minute sequential differences (rapid temporal changes) in sound, such as in speech.

Tonality is represented in more places than just the auditory cortex; one other specific area is the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC). A study explored the areas of the brain which were active during tonality processing, using fMRI. The results of this experiment showed preferential blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation of specific voxels in RMPFC for specific tonal arrangements. Though these collections of voxels do not represent the same tonal arrangements between subjects or within subjects over multiple trials, it is interesting and informative that RMPFC, an area not usually associated with audition, seems to code for immediate tonal arrangements in this respect. RMPFC is a subsection of the medial prefrontal cortex, which projects to many diverse areas including the amygdala, and is thought to aid in the inhibition of negative emotion.

Another study has suggested that people who experience &#x27;chills&#x27; while listening to music have a higher volume of fibres connecting their auditory cortex to areas associated with emotional processing.

In a study involving dichotic listening to speech, in which one message is presented to the right ear and another to the left, it was found that the participants chose letters with stops (e.g. &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;k&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;) far more often when presented to the right ear than the left. However, when presented with phonemic sounds of longer duration, such as vowels, the participants did not favor any particular ear. Due to the contralateral nature of the auditory system, the right ear is connected to Wernicke&#x27;s area, located within the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the left cerebral hemisphere.

Sounds entering the auditory cortex are treated differently depending on whether or not they register as speech. When people listen to speech, according to the strong and weak speech mode hypotheses, they, respectively, engage perceptual mechanisms unique to speech or engage their knowledge of language as a whole.

<doc id="994098" wikidata="Q471375" url="?curid=994098" title="Rubber bridge">
<text>Rubber bridge is a form of contract bridge played by two competing pairs using a particular method of scoring. A rubber is completed when one pair becomes first to win two &quot;games&quot;, each &quot;game&quot; presenting a score of 100 or more contract points; a new game ensues until one pair has won two games to conclude the rubber. Owing to the availability of various additional bonus and penalty points in the scoring, it is possible, though less common, to win the rubber by amassing more total points despite losing two games out of three. Rubber bridge involves a high degree of skill but there is also a fair amount of luck involved in who gets the best cards. A popular variation of rubber bridge is known as Chicago.

==Playing rubber bridge==

Rubber bridge is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. From high to low, the cards are ranked A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. Suits are ranked Spades (), Hearts (), Diamonds (), Clubs (). Four players play in two partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. Gameplay rotates clockwise around the table.

===Choosing partners and dealing===

At the beginning of the , cards are drawn to determine s and the of the first hand. A pack of cards is spread face down on the table and each player takes a card, but not from the ends. The player with the highest card deals the first hand and has choice of seat. The player with the second highest card partners with the dealer against the other two. The dealer selects a pack of cards and passes it to the player on their left to be shuffled. Dealer, who may give the cards a quick shuffle at this point, then passes it to be cut by the player on their right. They then deal one card at a time clockwise starting with the player on their left. Meanwhile, if a second pack is being used, dealer&#x27;s partner shuffles it and places it on their right, ready for the next dealer. This speeds up play and maintains the dealing order because there is always a shuffled pack of cards on the dealer&#x27;s left and each side deals the same pack throughout the rubber. The deal rotates clockwise after each hand until the rubber is completed.

===Auction===

The to be played is determined by an auction in which the players for the number of s they will make and the trumps or no trumps. A bid consists of the number of tricks above six one needs to make and the denomination; e.g. &quot;1&quot; is seven tricks with clubs as trumps, &quot;3NT&quot; is nine tricks with no trump suit. The dealer bids first. At their turn players may either: , bid to make a higher contract, &quot; an opponent&#x27;s contract (which increases the penalties for failing to make the contract or the points for making the contract) or &quot; their side&#x27;s doubled contract which doubles the points again. A player may bid again after an initial pass. The auction ends when any bid is followed by three consecutive passes. If all four players pass the hand is passed in and the deal rotates.

===Play===

Once the contract has been decided, the player of the winning pair who first mentioned the denomination of the contract becomes . The opening is made by the player to the declarer&#x27;s left. Declarer’s partner then lays down their hand face up on the table as , with the trump suit on their right. Declarer plays both his and dummy&#x27;s cards. Each player, in turn, plays a card to the trick and they must play a card of the suit led if they have one. A player who has no cards of the suit led may play any card either discarding or trumping. A trick is won by the highest card of the suit led unless trumps are played, when the highest trump wins. The winner of the trick leads to the next trick.

==Scoring==

The main article includes a detailed description of rubber bridge scoring with examples. Essentially, each winning bid&#x27;s value is scored &quot;below the line&quot; (e.g., 3 Spades nets 90 points below the line) and overtricks, bonuses, etc. are scored &quot;above the line&quot;, as are points for defeating contracts. Once a pair reaches 100 points &quot;below the line&quot;, the game ends and a new one begins, with a new line drawn underneath all previous points. The first team to win two games wins what is called the &quot;rubber&quot; and receives a large point bonus. Whoever has the highest point total after this bonus is assigned wins the match overall.

==Variants==
===Nullos===
Nullos is a variant of rubber bridge for two players.

The dealer deals thirteen cards to each player, who then view their hand. The remaining 26 cards become the &#x27;draw deck&#x27;. 

The player who did not deal then discards any number of their cards, between zero and 13, and draw back up to 13 from the draw deck. The dealer then discards any number of cards from their hand and redraws up to 13.

Players then bid in the usual way, starting with the player who did not deal, with an additional &#x27;nullos&#x27; bid.

A nullos bid is similar to a misère bid where the player tries to lose tricks. A winning nullos bid has no trumps.

Instead of bidding on how many tricks they will win, a player bidding nullos is stating how many tricks they will lose. For example, a bid of &#x27;1 nullos&#x27; means the player must lose at least 7 tricks, and a bid of &#x27;7 nullos&#x27; means they must lose all 13 tricks.

In the order of bidding, nullos is ranked between diamonds and hearts, so the order from lowest to highest is Clubs, Diamonds, nullos, Hearts, Spades, no trumps.

The player who did not deal leads first, and play happens in turn in the usual way, with winner of the trick leading next.

When scoring, nullos is scored at the same value as hearts and spades. For example, making a bid of &#x27;1 nullos&#x27; scores 30 points above the line.

If a player loses more tricks than they bid, they score overtricks. If they lose fewer tricks than they bid, they score undertricks. For example, a bid of &#x27;1 nullos&#x27; would score one overtrick if 8 tricks were lost or one undertrick if 6 tricks were lost.

==Tactics==
At rubber the goal is to win the most points over a series of hands and it is important to make contracts to try to win the rubber and get the bonus. Overtricks do not matter - even less than at IMPs. Balancing over low-level contracts is not as attractive, because unless one can make contract one has little to gain and may force the opponents into a higher-scoring contract. Sacrificing can be expensive and only preserves the current state rubber as far as points below the line go and a 500-point penalty is possibly worth as much as winning the rubber.

At rubber every hand is affected by the context of the score and there are many different factors to consider and weigh. One needs to be constantly aware of not just the vulnerability but what legs (part-games) both sides have as affects the meanings of bids. Game may only require 2 so it is worth stretching to bid it with a weak hand but not to go higher with a strong hand unless 6 is a reasonable chance. Part-scores like 40 and 60 are highly worthwhile as one can make game with two of major or 1NT respectively on a later hand.

This is very different from duplicate bridge where each part-score and game are worth fixed amounts and each hand is an individual battle over points.

==Laws of rubber bridge==
There are no universally accepted rules for rubber bridge, but some zonal organisations have published their own. An example for those wishing to abide by a published standard is &quot;The Laws of Rubber Bridge&quot; as published by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL).

==History==
Rubber bridge is the traditional form of contract bridge and remains the most common variant for club- or home-based social games, usually played with a fixed number of hands. It is not used for ACBL sanctioned duplicate play. It gained a lot of publicity after a celebrated match, referred to as the &quot;Bridge Battle of the Century&quot;, was held December 1931 to January 1932 between teams led by Ely Culbertson and Sidney Lenz. A total of 150 rubbers were played, and was ultimately won by the Culbertson team by a margin of 8,980 points. The match was a success both for the game itself and the concepts of bidding as promoted by Culbertson.

<doc id="994104" wikidata="Q1375092" url="?curid=994104" title="Super Crazy">
<text>Francisco Islas Rueda (born December 3, 1973), better known by his ring name Super Crazy, is a Mexican &quot;luchador&quot; (or professional wrestler). In Mexico, Islas has worked for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and made appearances for various independent promotions but is not currently associated with one specific Mexican promotion. As Super Crazy, Islas gained American exposure by working for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) between 1998 and 2000 and for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) between 2005 and 2008. He has also toured Japan on several occasions, working for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero-1), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1988–1997)===
Francisco Islas made his professional wrestling debut in February 1988, at just 14 years of age, after being trained by his older brother Rey Pantera. Islas took the ring name &quot;Super Crazy&quot;. He initially worked as an &quot;enmascarado&quot;, or masked wrestler, but lost the mask just over a month after his debut when he lost a &quot;Luchas de Apuestas&quot; (a &quot;bet match&quot;) to El Seminarista in March 1988. From 1988 until 1995 Super Crazy was a mainstay on the Mexican independent circuit working for various promotions, including appearances for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) in the year leading up to its closure. In the UWA Super Crazy won the UWA World Welterweight Championship on November 17, 1995, and held the title when the UWA closed in December 1995. After the UWA closed Super Crazy still used and defended the UWA title on various independent shows but once he signed with the AAA promotion in 1996 the title was not mentioned. In AAA he was given a new gimmick, a masked &quot;Rudo&quot; (villain or heel) character called &quot;Histeria&quot; (sometimes Anglicised as &quot;Hysteria&quot;). Together with Abismo Negro, Maniaco, Mosco de la Merced I and Mach-1 he comprised a wrestling group called &quot;Rudos de la Galaxia&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The bad guys of the universe&quot;), a group that was involved in a storyline feud with a &quot;tecnico&quot; (good guy or face) group called &quot;Los Cadetos del Espacio&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the Space Cadets&quot;). In the spring of 1997 Islas, as Histeria, made a couple of appearances for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) due to an AAA/WWF working agreement. Histeria worked mainly against &quot;Los Cadetos del Espacio&quot;, especially Venum in his appearances on &quot;RAW is WAR&quot; and &quot;Shotgun&quot;. In September 1997 Islas left AAA, giving the &quot;Histeria&quot; name and outfit to another AAA wrestler who had worked as &quot;Quarterback&quot; up until that time, he still wrestles as Histeria today.

Islas resumed working as &quot;Super Crazy&quot; when he left AAA to join the newly created Promo Azteca. Super Crazy also continued his feud with Venum, who now worked as &quot;Venum Black&quot; after leaving AAA, a feud that culminated in a &quot;mask vs. hair&quot; &quot;Luchas de Apuesta&quot; that Super Crazy won, unmasking Venum Black. After leaving AAA Super Crazy began defending the UWA World Welterweight title, losing it to Kid Guzmán in 1997. Super Crazy regained the title on June 15, 1998, during a show in Japan and successfully defended the title until October 13, 2000, where he lost it to El Oriental. In November 1997 Islas began working for WWF under the name &quot;Super Loco&quot;, mainly on their &quot;Super Astros&quot; shows, his only &quot;Main show&quot; appearance was a loss to El Águila in the first round of the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship tournament.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling ===
==== Early years (1998–2000) ====
Super Crazy was signed to a contract by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) owner Paul Heyman in 1998 after Heyman saw him work for the WWF and on the recommendation of Konnan who had worked for Heyman. Crazy defeated Antifaz del Nortre in his televised ECW debut on the December 31 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. He was brought in to showcase cruiserweight action and was paired with other smaller wrestlers in a series of well-received matches for the next two years.

His first major rivalry in the cruiserweight division came against Yoshihiro Tajiri as the duo competed against each other in a series of matches in the first half of 1999, where the duo exchanged wins on &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, supercards and the Guilty as Charged and the Living Dangerously pay-per-view events. Crazy followed with participation in a series of matches with international cruiserweights as he racked up wins against fellow luchador Mosco de la Merced at CyberSlam, Japanese wrestler Taka Michinoku at Hardcore Heaven while losing to Italian Little Guido at Hostile City Showdown and defeating him at July&#x27;s Heat Wave pay-per-view.

Crazy closed the year with two high-profile three-way dance matches, the first against Tajiri and Guido at Anarchy Rulz and the second against Tajiri and Jerry Lynn at November to Remember. In the end of the year, Crazy joined forces with rival Tajiri and defeated Jerry Lynn and Little Guido in a tag team match at Guilty as Charged on January 9, 2000.

==== World Television Champion and various feuds (2000–2001) ====
Super Crazy was booked to win a tournament in March for the World Television Championship after the title had been vacated by Rob Van Dam due to an injury. He defeated CW Anderson in the quarter-final round on March 4, Little Guido in the semi-final round and Rhino in the final round at the Living Dangerously pay-per-view, despite interference from The Network. Crazy made his first televised title defense against Rhino on the March 31 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;. He dropped the title to Yoshihiro Tajiri in a three-way dance, also involving Little Guido on the April 14 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;. After the title loss, Crazy faced Guido and Kid Kash in a three-way dance at CyberSlam, which Guido won.

Super Crazy went on a hiatus for the next few months until pre-taped vignettes began airing on television in October, which hyped his return at the November to Remember pay-per-view. He was initially booked to face CW Anderson at the event but he was replaced by Kid Kash. Later in the night, he participated in a match for the World Tag Team Championship between The Unholy Alliance (Yoshihiro Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck) and Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke). Crazy substituted for Whipwreck after the latter got injured. FBI retained the titles. Crazy teamed with Unholy Alliance against Hot Commodity (E. Z. Money, Julio Dinero and Chris Hamrick) in a six-man tag team match on the November 19 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. Crazy&#x27;s team lost and the Unholy Alliance turned on him when Whipwreck helped Tajiri in defeating Crazy in a match. Crazy brought Kid Kash as his mystery partner against Unholy Alliance in a tag team match at Massacre on 34th Street on December 3, which Crazy&#x27;s team lost. Crazy and Kash were pitted against Unholy Alliance and Full Blooded Italians in a three-way dance at ECW&#x27;s final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001. Unholy Alliance won the match. Crazy performed at ECW&#x27;s final show on January 13, where he lost to Tajiri. ECW folded down as it was bought by WWF due to the bankruptcy.

===Independent circuit (2001–2005)===
After ECW folded, Super Crazy wrestled for different promotions in the US, including the hardcore promotions Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) and Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), cementing his status as &quot;the Extreme Luchador&quot; or &quot;the Insane Luchador&quot;. He also began working for Puerto Rico-based International Wrestling Association (IWA). At Ring of Honor&#x27;s debut show, &quot;The Era of Honor Begins&quot; on February 23, 2002, Crazy defeated Eddie Guerrero to become the inaugural IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. He was defeated for the title on April 6 by Andy Anderson. Crazy regained the title on April 13 when Anderson forfeited it due to injury. Crazy lost the title once more on April 20, when he was defeated by Anarchy. Super Crazy also held the IWA Hardcore Championship on nine occasions between 2002 and 2005. He also held the IWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship three times in that time period. On February 24, 2001, Super Crazy defeated Pablo Marquez to win the UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, which like the UWA Welterweight title was still used on the independent scene in Mexico and Puerto Rico. By the end of 2001 Super Crazy vacated the UWA Junior Heavyweight title. Super Crazy made a couple of special appearances for his old company AAA, teaming with El Alebrije and Randy to defeat Máscara Magligna, Pentagón and Monsther at the 2001 &quot;Verano de Escandalo&quot;. At the following year&#x27;s &quot;Verano de Escandalo&quot; Super Crazy teamed with Mr. Águila, La Parka and Latin Lover to defeat Cibernético, Heavy Metal, Héctor Garza and Leatherface.

He made four tours with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in 2002 and 2003. His first tour lasted from November to December 2002 and saw Super Crazy work mainly tag matches, teaming mainly with Koji Kanemoto and/or The Stampede Kid against a variety of opponents including Jushin Thunder Liger, El Samurai and Heat. His second tour took place in February 2003 and saw Super Crazy team up mainly with Curry Man and Tiger Mask. Super Crazy mainly faced Jushin Thunder Liger&#x27;s CTU faction. The third tour took place in May 2003, this time Super Crazy often worked with other &quot;Luchadors&quot; touring NJPW at the time including Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero and Sangre Azteca. His fourth, and so far final, NJPW tour took place in October and November 2003, again Crazy mainly worked in tag team matches, siding with Koji Kanemoto or Tiger Mask against a variety of opponents. Super Crazy appeared on the March 5, 2003 edition of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s weekly PPV&#x27;s as one of Konnan&#x27;s &quot;luchador&quot; challengers, where he lost to Jerry Lynn. Between January and March 2005 Super Crazy worked for the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE, winning the ZERO-ONE/UPW/WORLD-1 International Junior Heavyweight Championship from Tatsuhito Takaiwa on December 18, 2004. Crazy lost the title to Ikuto Hidaka on April 14, 2005, at Zero-1&#x27;s &quot;Outburst Revolution&quot; show.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====The Mexicools (2005–2006)====

In 2005, Crazy signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He initially appeared at the WWE-promoted ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005, winning an international three-way dance by pinning Yoshihiro Tajiri in the final pinfall of the match, which also involved Little Guido Maritato During the match, he performed a moonsault from a second story balcony.

Crazy&#x27;s first appearance on WWE television came during the June 18, 2005 airing of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;&#x27;s sister show &quot;WWE Velocity&quot;, teaming with Psicosis to defeat Akio and Billy Kidman. Psicosis, Super Crazy, and Juventud grouped together to form a stable known as the Mexicools. The group made their debut as heels on the June 23, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when all three members rode to the ring on John Deere lawn mowers with the decals altered to say &quot;Juan&quot; Deere (&quot;John&quot; in Spanish) and wearing matching coveralls. They then attacked Chavo Guerrero and Paul London during their Cruiserweight Championship match. Juventud cut a promo questioning the lack of &quot;true Mexican luchadores&quot; in the Cruiserweight Division, before going on to deride the current state of Mexican Americans in general. Psicosis dubbed the lawnmower they arrived on a &quot;Mexican Limo 2005&quot; and the group claimed that even Mexico&#x27;s president mocks Mexicans in the United States (in reference to Vicente Fox&#x27;s controversial remark that Mexican immigrants do the jobs &quot;not even the blacks want to do&quot;). Juventud then stated that they were &quot;no longer there to clean toilets and work for &quot;them&quot; (the &quot;gringos&quot;) but &quot;they&quot; were going to be working for &quot;us&quot; (The Mexicools)&quot;, before dubbing the team &quot;not Mexi&quot;cans&quot; but Mexi&quot;cools&quot;!&quot; In the following weeks, they continued to interfere in matches and mock the stereotypical image of Mexicans in the United States.

Despite being introduced as heels, the group quickly became favorites of the audience and eventually began acting as faces. They received strong approval from the audience even during their debut, which occurred in Tucson, Arizona. The Mexicools&#x27; first PPV debut was on July 24 at The Great American Bash, defeating bWo in a six-man tag team match. During the December 2 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Super Crazy and Psicosis competed in an over the top rope battle royal against 5 other tag teams. The pair managed to win and earned themselves a match against MNM at Armageddon for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Unfortunately for the Mexicools, MNM lost the tag team titles before their match. Not long after, Super Crazy and Psicosis became the only Mexicools left in WWE, as Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006. Super Crazy and Psicosis continued to wrestle as a tag team, but Crazy got his own push as a singles competitor, eventually earning himself #1 contendership for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. By June 2006 Super Crazy&#x27;s partnership with Psicosis on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; began to crumble when Psicosis repeatedly abandoned Crazy during incidents with monster heel The Great Khali. This resulted in the pairing splitting up and then engaging in a short-lived feud after Psicosis turned heel. After the breakup, both Psicosis and Super Crazy disappeared off WWE programming.

====Singles competition (2006–2008)====
On September 4, Super Crazy made his &quot;Raw&quot; debut match and defeated Chris Masters using his trademark moonsault. Crazy continued his feud with Masters throughout September, defeated him once more and competing with Masters, along with four other wrestlers (Johnny Nitro, Carlito, Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton) in a Six-Pack Challenge Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on the September 18 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, which neither Masters or Crazy were able to win. Crazy was then involved in angles with Nitro and Melina, during which he was aligned with Mickie James, who was feuding with Melina at the time.

Super Crazy suffered an injury to his left knee at a house show which occurred on April 21, 2007, in Oberhausen, Germany. The injury was believed to be a MCL tear. Super Crazy returned to action on June 1 in a match taped for &quot;Heat&quot;, losing to the returning William Regal. On the July 2 of &quot;Raw&quot;, Super Crazy was Mr. Kennedy&#x27;s opponent in a &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; match. Before the match began, Super Crazy appeared to have agreed to let Kennedy win, however, he defeated Kennedy with a roll-up shortly after the match began, while Kennedy was performing his introduction. Kennedy assaulted Super Crazy later that night. Kennedy then defeated Super Crazy in a grudge match two weeks later. In October 2007, Super Crazy formed a tag team with Jim Duggan. The team primarily competed on &quot;Heat&quot; to moderate success until Super Crazy was drafted to the ECW brand.

As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Super Crazy was drafted to the ECW brand. Super Crazy returned to SmackDown (although wearing an ECW shirt), losing to The Brian Kendrick. On the August 19 episode of &quot;ECW on Sci-Fi&quot;, Super Crazy debuted on the ECW brand, teaming with Evan Bourne and Tommy Dreamer against and lost to John Morrison, Chavo Guerrero and The Miz. On the September 5 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, he defeated Ryan Braddock but was kicked by Vladimir Kozlov after the match. On the October 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he lost to Kendrick&#x27;s bodyguard, Ezekiel Jackson. Super Crazy&#x27;s last WWE match took place the following week on the October 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, losing to Kendrick. On November 5, 2008, WWE announced that Islas had requested and granted his release from his WWE contract, due to being unhappy with his spot in the company.

In the first fall Crazy pinned XL to win the XNL Championship, but the roles were reversed in the second fall, when XL pinned Crazy to win the X–LAW Junior Heavyweight Championship.

In 2010 and 2011, Super Crazy represented &quot;Los Perros del Mal&quot; in the group&#x27;s feud with Los Psycho Circus. On May 29, 2011, at &quot;Perros del Mal Producciones&quot;&#x27; third anniversary show, the two groups faced each other in a six man tag team steel cage Masks vs. Hairs &quot;Lucha de Apuesta&quot;, which ended with Super Crazy being left in the cage, forcing him to have his head shaved bald.

In July 2012, he returned to Noah. On July 22, Crazy, along with Ricky Marvin, defeated Special Assault Team (Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki), won the GHC Heavyweight Junior Tag Team Championship.

On March 10, 2013, Crazy and Marvin lost the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to Genba Hirayanagi and Maybach Taniguchi Jr. Crazy spent the first six months of 2013 in Mexico.

In June 2013, he returned to Noah with his nephew Pesadilla, in the Southern Navigation tour.

Despite winning his first three matches jumping out to an early lead in his block, Crazy lost his final three matches including a match on the final day against Bengala (played by former partner Ricky Marvin) which would have brought Crazy into at least a tie for first place in his block. Alas, Crazy finished in a four-way tie for third place with six points. In September, Crazy teamed with Hitoshi Kumano in the Global Junior Tag League marking Crazy&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance in the tournament.

<doc id="994106" wikidata="Q1789113" url="?curid=994106" title="Marjan, Split">
<text>Marjan () is a hill on the peninsula of the city of Split, the second largest city of Croatia. It is covered in a dense Mediterranean pine forest and completely surrounded by the city and the sea, making it a unique sight. Originally used as a park by the citizens as early as the 3rd century, it is a favorite weekend excursion destination and a recreational center for the city. It is also the setting for numerous beaches and jogging trails as well as tennis courts and the city Zoo, all surrounded by the scenic forest. The tip of the peninsula houses the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (&quot;Institut za oceanografiju i ribarstvo,&quot; IZOR).

Marjan is 178 m tall and offers a view of the entire city, the surrounding islands, and the nearby mountains of Mosor and Kozjak.

Beaches Obojena, Kašjuni and Bene are located at the foot of Marjan hill.

== History ==
In ancient times Emperor Diocletian built his palace a few minutes walk from Marjan. This opulent palace-city was actually inhabited by up to 8,000 to 10,000 people,
who required parks and recreation space, Diocletian therefore organized some areas of Marjan nearer to the palace as a park. There is also a small rustic early 13th century AD church situated on Marjan Hill. The church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas (Sv. Nikole) a favourite saint of fishermen, of which there are many in Split. Two and a half kilometres further along the path that runs along the south rim of Marjan is the fifteenth century church of St. Jerome (Sv. Jeronima). The church has an altar carved by Andrija Aleši. Built into clefts in the cliffs directly above and behind St. Jerome are a group of Renaissance hermitage caves, first used in the 15th century. On the eastern slopes of the Marjan, just above the city, is Split&#x27;s Old Jewish Cemetery. First established in 1573, the cemetery has over 700 graves, with readable tombstones from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, the last burial taking place in 1945 when it was closed and protected as a monument.

Marjan has become a symbol of Split in the last century and a half, before that it was considered an ordinary part of the landscape. As the city grew, however, it was left out because of its rocky and difficult terrain, and became, in effect, a part of the wilderness next to the very center of the city. Soon the citizens started to frequent it as a picnic spot and a romantic retreat, its many beaches adding to its popularity as well.

During the Second World War, Marjan was the subject of a popular Partisan song &quot;Marjane, Marjane&quot;, sung by the Split (and Dalmatian) members of that anti-fascist movement and was reportedly a favorite song of resistance leader and future president of the new SFR Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito. Indeed, the flamboyant Partisan leader was so fond of the hill itself, he chose it as the site for the summer residence of the Yugoslav president, the &quot;Vila Dalmacija&quot;. In the 1950s, during the period of the second Yugoslavia, the Federal Government, in conjunction with local Split authorities, undertook a massive project for the transformation of the entire wild hill into a forest park. The hill was intensively forested (large parts of it were barren until then), many recreational facilities were built, including jogging tracks, a road system encircling the peninsula, a maritime research institute, the Split City Zoo (now fallen into disrepair), botanical garden (recently abandoned) and a water pipeline reaching all the way to the top of the hill. The authorities also constructed the city weather station and two &quot;vidilice&quot;, or &quot;look-out points&quot;, as resting places connected with a long stairway all the way to the Diocletian&#x27;s Palace, the &quot;Riva&quot; promenade and the rest of the city center.

On the south side of the Marjan is the Meštrović Gallery housed in the former villa of Ivan Meštrović, thought by many to be one of the greatest sculptors of religious subjects since the Renaissance.

<doc id="994108" wikidata="Q1558507" url="?curid=994108" title="Transverse temporal gyrus">
<text>The transverse temporal gyrus, also called Heschl&#x27;s gyrus () or Heschl&#x27;s convolutions, is a gyrus found in the area of each primary auditory cortex buried within the lateral sulcus of the human brain, occupying Brodmann areas 41 and 42. Transverse temporal gyri are superior to and separated from the planum temporale (cortex involved in language production) by Heschl&#x27;s sulcus. Transverse temporal gyri are found in varying numbers in both the right and left hemispheres of the brain and one study found that this number is not related to the hemisphere or dominance of hemisphere studied in subjects. Transverse temporal gyri can be viewed in the sagittal plane as either an omega shape (if one gyrus is present) or a heart shape (if two gyri and a sulcus are present).

Transverse temporal gyri are the first cortical structures to process incoming auditory information. Anatomically, the transverse temporal gyri are distinct in that they run mediolaterally (toward the center of the brain), rather than front to back as all other temporal lobe gyri run.

The &quot;Heschl&#x27;s gyri&quot; are named after Richard L. Heschl.

== Processing tone ==

The transverse temporal gyri are active during auditory processing under fMRI for tone and semantic tasks. Transverse temporal gyri were found in one study to have significantly faster processing rates (33 Hz) in the left hemisphere compared to those in the right hemisphere (3 Hz). Additionally this difference in processing rate was found to be related to the volume of rate-related cortex in the gyri; right transverse temporal gyri were found to be more active during temporal processing, and these gyri were found to have more “rate-related cortex”. White and grey matter volumes of transverse temporal gyri were not found to relate to this processing speed, although larger white matter volumes in subjects are associated with increased sensitivity to “rapid auditory input”.

The role of transverse temporal gyri in auditory processing of tone is demonstrated by a study by Wong, Warrier et al. (2008). This study revealed the following: subjects who could successfully form an association between Mandarin Chinese “pitch patterns” and word meaning were found to have transverse temporal gyri with larger volume than subjects who had “difficulty learning these associations.” Successful completion of the previous task also was found to be associated with a “greater concentration of white matter” in the left transverse temporal gyri of the subject. In general, larger transverse temporal gyri “could be associated with more efficient processing of speech-related cues which could facilitate learning and perceiving new speech sounds.”

== Inner voice ==

Research on the inner voice perceived by humans led to the identification of these gyri as the area of the brain activated during such dialogue with oneself. Specifically, Heschl&#x27;s gyrus responded to spontaneous inner speech, while it was hypoactive during task-elicited inner speech (repeating words prompted by an experimenter).

==Mismatch negativity==
One of the famous event-related potential (ERP) components is mismatch negativity. This component is considered to represent a prediction error process in the brain. This ERP has probably two generators, one in the right prefrontal lobe, and the other in the primary auditory regions - the transverse temporal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus.

<doc id="994118" wikidata="Q463678" url="?curid=994118" title="Grover Washington Jr.">
<text>Grover Washington Jr. (December 12, 1943 – December 17, 1999) was an American jazz-funk and soul-jazz saxophonist and Grammy Award winner. Along with Wes Montgomery and George Benson, he is considered by many to be one of the founders and legends of the smooth jazz genre.
He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Washington made some of the genre&#x27;s most memorable hits, including &quot;Mister Magic&quot;, &quot;Reed Seed&quot;, &quot;Black Frost&quot;, &quot;Winelight&quot;, &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;, &quot;Let it Flow (For &#x27;Dr. J&#x27;)&quot;, and &quot;The Best is Yet to Come&quot;. In addition, he performed very frequently with other artists, including Bill Withers on &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, Patti LaBelle on &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;, and Phyllis Hyman on &quot;A Sacred Kind of Love&quot;.

==Early life==
Washington was born in Buffalo, New York, on December 12, 1943. His mother was a church chorister, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well, so music was everywhere in the home. He grew up listening to the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, and others like them. At the age of 8, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone. He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians. His younger brother, drummer Darryl Washington, would follow in his footsteps. He also had another younger brother named Michael Washington, who was an accomplished gospel music organist who mastered the Hammond B3 organ. Washington was part of a vocal ensemble, the Teen Kings, which included Lonnie Smith.

==Career==
===Early career===
Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs and then the Mark III Trio from Mansfield, Ohio. Shortly thereafter, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he met drummer Billy Cobham. A music mainstay in New York City, Cobham introduced Washington to many New York musicians. After leaving the Army, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967. In 1970 and 1971, he appeared on Leon Spencer&#x27;s first two albums on Prestige Records, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.

Washington&#x27;s big break came when alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor&#x27;s Kudu Records, and Washington took his place, even though he was a backup. This led to his first solo album, &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;. He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones. Refreshing for his time, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.

===Rise to fame===
While his first three albums established him as a force in jazz and soul music, it was his fourth album in 1974, &quot;Mister Magic&quot;, that proved a major commercial success. The album climbed to number 1 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B album chart and number 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 album chart. The title track reached No. 16 on the R&amp;B singles chart (#54, pop). All these albums included guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington&#x27;s arsenal. His follow-up on Kudu in 1975, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; also made No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B album chart and No. 10 on the pop album chart. Both albums were major parts of the jazz-funk movement of the mid-1970s.

A string of acclaimed records brought Washington through the 1970s, culminating in the signature piece for everything he would do from then on. &quot;Winelight&quot; (1980) was the album that defined everything Washington was then about, having signed for Elektra Records, part of the major Warner Music group. The album was smooth, fused with R&amp;B and easy listening feel. Washington&#x27;s love of basketball, especially the Philadelphia 76ers, led him to dedicate the second track, &quot;Let It Flow&quot;, to Julius Erving (Dr. J). The highlight of the album was his collaboration with soul artist Bill Withers, &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, a hit on radio during the spring and summer of 1981, peaking at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album went platinum in 1981, and also won Grammy Awards in 1982 for Best R&amp;B Song (&quot;Just The Two of Us&quot;), and Best Jazz Fusion Performance (&quot;Winelight&quot;). &quot;Winelight&quot; was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.

In the post-&quot;Winelight&quot; era, Washington is credited for giving rise to a new batch of talent that would make its mark in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is known for bringing Kenny G to the forefront, as well as artists such as Kirk Whalum, Walter Beasley, Steve Cole, Pamela Williams, Najee, Boney James and George Howard. His song &quot;Mister Magic&quot; is noted as being influential on go-go music starting in the mid-1970s.

==Equipment==

(Although he was later photographed with Keilwerth SX90 and SX90R black nickel plated soprano, alto, and tenor saxophones on album covers, he rarely played them live or in the studio.)

==Death==
On December 17, 1999, five days after his 56th birthday, Washington collapsed while waiting in the green room after performing four songs for &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot;, at CBS Studios in New York City. He was taken to St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 pm. His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack. He is interred at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

==Tributes==
A large mural of Washington, part of the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is just south of the intersection of Broad and Diamond streets. A Philadelphia middle school in the Olney section of the city is named after Washington. Grover Washington Jr. Middle School caters to fifth- to eighth-grade students interested in the creative and performing arts.

There is a mural dedicated to Grover Washington, Jr. in Buffalo, where he grew up and attended school.

==Inductions and other awards==
In 1992, Washington was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Alliance Walk Of Fame.

On April 24, 2023, Washington was inducted into the newly established, Atlantic City Walk Of Fame presented by, The National R&amp;B Music Society Inc. Washington&#x27;s daughter Shana Washington, was in attendance to accept the honor. Jazz and R&amp;B artist Jean Carn inducted Washington. James Brown, The Delfonics and Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials were also inducted in the inaugural class.

<text>Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) is an agency of the Zimbabwe government managing national parks. Zimbabwe&#x27;s game reserves are managed by the government. They were initially founded as a means of using unproductive land.

== History ==
The first proclaimed game reserve was Wankie (now Hwange), formed in 1928 and upgraded in the 1949 National Parks Act. The then-Rhodesia&#x27;s game section was originally formed in 1952 as a subsidiary of the Department of Mines, Lands and Surveys. This was the nucleus that became the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management in 1964.

The Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975 established the agency. It was a quintessential breakthrough for conservation. The attitude of people towards wildlife underwent a profound change. Under the act, ownership of wildlife passed from the state to whoever owned the land the animal lived on.

When the landowners (both communal and private) became custodians of the wildlife, a change in mindset occurred. People began to see their wildlife resources as an asset to be nurtured, ensuring their benefits continued into the future. Gradually, fence-breaking elephant and zebra were not viewed as nuisances to be eradicated; herds of impala were no longer a quick, easy meal.

Within the Parks and Wildlife Act, various levels were defined at which state-owned land was to be protected and utilised. Gone was the old Game Department that issued hunting licences which, for a nominal fee, allowed settlers to hunt wildlife in all areas but a few game reserves. A system of national parks, botanical reserves and gardens, sanctuaries, recreational parks and safari areas was set firmly in place. Since 1975, the act has been amended and refined, allowing the evolution of a dynamic wildlife-protection process.

Many African countries have since adopted this philosophy. So far-reaching was the concept of the original act that it now enshrines many aspects of grassroots conservation being implemented worldwide. Communal or traditional tribal areas and privately owned land were also categorised for different levels of utilisation.

Communal areas harbouring significant wildlife resources or bordering national parks were given Appropriate Authority status through their Rural Councils, and as a result the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources was born. CAMPFIRE has developed into an important conservation strategy, ensuring that significant financial earnings revert to rural communities for their benefit. This philosophy has been adopted on a pan-African basis and is slowly being implemented in Asia and South America as well.

Many of Zimbabwe&#x27;s national parks, such as Victoria Falls, Mana Pools and Hwange, are renowned worldwide, though the country also has lesser-known gems such as Chizarira and Gonarezhou. Parts of the Rhodes Estate, established in Rhodes&#x27; will of 1902, were bequeathed to the nation for farming, forestry and agricultural research. This land later became part of the rocky Matobo and mountainous Nyanga National Parks.

<doc id="994124" wikidata="Q3348196" url="?curid=994124" title="Oblasts of Ukraine">
<text>An oblast (, ; ), sometimes translated as region or province, is the main type of first-level administrative division of Ukraine. The country&#x27;s territory is divided into 24 oblasts, as well as one autonomous republic and two cities with special status.

As Ukraine is a unitary state, oblasts do not have much legal scope of competence other than that which is established in the Ukrainian Constitution and devolved by law. Articles 140–146 of of the constitution deal directly with local authorities and their competence.

Oblasts are divided into raions, with each oblast having between three and eight raions following the July 2020 reform.

==General characteristics==
In Ukraine, the term &quot;oblast&quot; denotes a primary administrative division. Under the Russian Empire and into the 1920s, Ukraine was divided between several governorates. The term &quot;oblast&quot; was introduced in 1932 by Soviet authorities when the Ukrainian SSR was divided into seven oblasts, replacing the previous subdivision system based on okruhas and encompassing 406 raions (districts). The first oblasts were Vinnytsia Oblast, Kyiv Oblast, Odesa Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Soon after that, in the summer of 1932, Donetsk Oblast was formed out of eastern parts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts; in the fall of 1932 Chernihiv Oblast was formed on the border of Kyiv and Kharkiv oblasts.

Between 1935 and 1938, there were several newly created and self-governed special border okrugs (okruhas) located along the western border of the Soviet Union in Ukraine and Belarus. Upon liquidation of the okruhas in 1937–1938, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Kharkiv oblasts were each split into four additional oblasts (Zhytomyr Oblast, Kamianets-Podilsky Oblast (later Khmelnytskyi), Mykolaiv Oblast, Poltava Oblast). Just before World War II, the Donetsk Oblast was split into Stalino Oblast and Voroshylovhrad Oblast and the Kirovohrad Oblast was created out of portions of Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Odesa oblasts.

During World War II, Ukraine added eight more oblasts of the West Ukraine and Bessarabia. Upon the occupation of Ukraine by Nazi Germany the territory was split between General Government, Kingdom of Romania and Reichskommissariat Ukraine and carried out a completely different administrative division, see Reichskommissariat Ukraine. With the re-establishing of Soviet power in the state after the war, the administrative division by oblast resumed, adding one more oblast—Zakarpattia. In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian SSR; parts of the surrounding oblasts were incorporated into the Cherkasy Oblast, while Izmail Oblast was absorbed by Odesa Oblast. In 1959, Drohobych Oblast was merged with Lviv Oblast.

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their respective administrative centers, which are also the largest and most developed cities in the region. Oblast populations range from 904,000 in Chernivtsi Oblast to 4.4 million in the eastern Donetsk Oblast.

===Original in 1932===
* Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, centered in Dnipropetrovsk (subdivided into raions)
* Kharkiv Oblast, centered in Kharkiv (subdivided into raions)
* Kyiv Oblast, centered in Kyiv (subdivided into raions)
* Odesa Oblast, centered in Odesa (subdivided into raions)
* Vinnytsia Oblast, centered in Vinnytsia (subdivided into raions)

==Constitutional provisions and authority==
The Ukrainian constitution establishes Ukraine as a unitary state. The specific text of the constitution that refers to the territorial structure is as follows.

Each of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts has its own legislative and executive authority, most of which is subordinate to the central government authorities in Kyiv. Each region is administered under laws passed by the Ukrainian government and the Constitution of Ukraine. Each region levies its own taxes and, in return, receives a portion of its budget from Kyiv, which gives them a portion of the taxes it levies.

Executive power in each of the oblasts (as well as in other subdivisions of Ukraine) is exercised by local elected administrations. The heads of local administrations are in turn appointed and dismissed by the President of Ukraine upon nomination by the Cabinet of Ministers. Since Ukraine is a unitary state, there is little true political power and weight that these local administrations actually hold. Carrying out their authority, the heads of local administrations are accountable to the President and are subordinate to higher bodies of executive leadership. According to the Constitution the head of the heads of the local Oblast administrations should resign after a new President is elected.

Legislative power in the oblast governments is exercised by their respective oblast councils, which in turn supervise the activities of local administrations. They also have considerable budgets managed by an oblast council () made up of people&#x27;s deputies (representatives) voted into office in regional elections every four years, the last of which took place in 2020.

==Nomenclature==
The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city. For example, Poltava is the administrative center of Poltava Oblast. Most of them are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, such as Poltava Oblast, which is also called &quot;Poltavshchyna&quot; ().

Exceptions to this rule include two oblasts, Volyn and Zakarpattia, which retain the names of their respective historical regions, &quot;Volyn&quot; (Volhynia) and &quot;Zakarpattia&quot; (Transcarpathia), whose respective capitals are Lutsk and Uzhhorod.

The capital cities of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Kirovohrad Oblast were renamed to Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi in 2016 as part of a process of replacing Soviet toponyms. As the names of the oblasts are mentioned in the Ukrainian constitution, changing them requires a complicated and lengthy process, thus as of 2024, the two oblasts still formally retain their Soviet-era names.

==List==
According to the Ukrainian constitution, Ukraine is divided into 24 oblasts. However, the majority of four oblasts are under Russian occupation. These oblasts are written in the &quot;italic&quot; typeface.

===Former===
* Izmail Oblast (initially as Akkerman Oblast) existed in 1940–41 and 1944–54 (under Romanian occupation, later was added to Odesa Oblast)
* Drohobych Oblast existed from 1939–1941 and 1944–1959 (under German occupation, it was merged into Lviv Oblast)
* Crimean Oblast (1954–1991) was transformed into Crimean ASSR

===Renamed===
* Stalino Oblast was the name of Donetsk Oblast 1938–41 and 1943–61 (created out of the united Donetsk Oblast 1932–38, German occupation 1941–43)
* Akkerman Oblast was the name of Izmail Oblast 1940
* Stanislav Oblast was the name of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast 1939–41 and 1944–62 (German occupation 1941–44)
* Kamianetsk-Podilska Oblast was the name of Khmelnytskyi Oblast 1937–41 and 1944–54 (German occupation 1941–44, later transfer of administrative center to Khmelnytskyi)
* Voroshylovhrad Oblast was the name of Luhansk Oblast 1938–42, 1943–58 and 1970–90 (German occupation 1942–43)
* Tarnopil Oblast was the name of Ternopil Oblast 1939–41 (renamed soon after World War II)
The Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Kirovohrad Oblast are pending renaming following the renaming of their capital cities to Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi.

<doc id="994127" wikidata="Q13581185" url="?curid=994127" title="HMS Gurkha (G63)">
<text>HMS &quot;Gurkha&quot; was an L-class destroyer in Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy during World War II. She was originally to be named &quot;Larne&quot; in line with her class letter. However, after the was sunk in April 1940 the officers and men of the Gurkha regiments each subscribed one day&#x27;s pay to replace her and &quot;Larne&quot; was renamed before launching.

Her only commanding officer (Commander Charles Nugent Lentaigne) was brother of Joe Lentaigne who was an officer in the 4th (Prince of Wales&#x27; Own) Gurkhas.

==Construction and design==
On 31 March 1938 an order was placed with Cammell Laird for &quot;Larne&quot;, one of eight L-class destroyers ordered that day and was laid down on 18 October 1938, the first of her class.

In April 1940, the Tribal-class destroyer was sunk off Norway, and in June it was decided to rename &quot;Larne&quot; as &quot;Gurkha&quot; to continue the relationship between the ship and the Gurkha Regiment. She was launched on 8 July 1940 by Mary Churchill, the youngest child of the Prime Minister and his wife Clementine. Only 17 years old at the time, she later recalled the &quot;emotion and excitement&quot; of the launch, describing the occasion as &quot;thrilling&quot;:

&quot;It was a beautiful day and I waved the new vessel away most proudly. It was at that time customary for the shipbuilders to give the sponsor of a ship a present: my &#x27;prize&#x27; was a lovely Victorian diamond necklace.&quot; 

Her parents were not present at the launch, but Soames says that when she got home they were &quot;. . . knocked endways by my diamonds.&quot; Even near the end of her life, she remembered the launch as being like a &quot;fairy-tale.&quot;

The L class was intended to have a main gun armament of six QF 4.7 inch Mark XI guns in three enclosed twin Mark XX mounts, but delays in production of the new gun mount resulted in the July 1940 decision to complete four of the class, including &quot;Gurkha&quot;, with a revised main gun armament of eight QF Mk XVI naval guns in four twin mounts. Close-in anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single quadruple 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot;, two single 20 mm cannon and two quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mounts. Eight torpedo tubes were carried in two quadruple mounts. 110 depth charges were carried.

&quot;Gurkha&quot; reached a speed of on sea trials and was completed on 18 February 1941.

==Service history==
On commissioning, &quot;Gurkha&quot; joined the 11th Escort Group. On 25 March 1941, the steamer &quot;Beaverbrae&quot; was sunk by German bombers and &quot;Gurkha&quot;, together with the destroyer rescued &quot;Beaverbrae&quot;″s crew. While returning to Scapa Flow the next day, &quot;Gurkha&quot; collided with a wooden drifter, sinking the fishing boat and sustaining serious damage. She was under repair at Rosyth until June 1941.

Following repair, &quot;Gurkha&quot; was deployed on convoy escort duties in the Western Approaches. She guarded Malta Convoys (1941), destroyed the Italian submarine , and guarded United Kingdom to Gibraltar convoys.

She was torpedoed by off Sidi Barrani on 17 January 1942 and sank after 90 minutes. The surviving crew members were saved by the Dutch destroyer .

<text>Daubach is an &quot;Ortsgemeinde&quot; – a municipality belonging to a &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;, a kind of collective municipality – in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Bad Sobernheim, whose seat is in the like-named town.

==Geography==

===Location===
Daubach lies in the southern Hunsrück north of Bad Sobernheim. It is a residential community that is nonetheless characterized by agriculture. The municipal area measures 292 ha.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Clockwise from the north, Daubach&#x27;s neighbours are the municipalities of Rehbach, Bockenau, Nußbaum and the town of Bad Sobernheim, although this is in fact the outlying piece of that town&#x27;s municipal area, a mostly rural swathe of land, not the one containing the actual town. Daubach&#x27;s municipal area also comes to within a matter of metres of a salient jutting out of Waldböckelheim’s municipal area.

===Constituent communities===
Also belonging to Daubach are the outlying homesteads of Birkenhof and Sonnenhof.

==History==
About how the village came to have the name Daubach nothing is known. What is known, however, is that the name was written &quot;Daupach&quot; in 1377, thus showing at least that the village has had a similar name for well over six hundred years. It lay on the road that led from Meisenheim and Sobernheim by way of Eckweiler (a now vanished village that was given up in 1979, lying in what is now Bad Sobernheim’s municipal exclave northwest of Daubach), Gemünden and Kirchberg to Trier. Daubach’s membership in the church parish called “&quot;Geh in Kirche&quot;” (“Go to Church”) was mentioned quite early on. With the partition of the County of Sponheim about 1232, Daubach passed to the “Further” County of Sponheim-Kreuznach and to the newly founded &quot;Amt&quot; of Winterburg. Between 1580 and 1600, Daubach had 12 houses and 54 inhabitants. Daubach and Eckweiler for centuries shared the same history. In 1866, the Evangelical church was built, but it remained a branch church of Eckweiler. The Catholics belonged to the parish of Rehbach.

===Population development===
Daubach&#x27;s population development since Napoleonic times is shown in the table below. The figures for the years from 1871 to 1987 are drawn from census data:
==Religion==
As at 31 August 2013, there are 228 full-time residents in Daubach, and of those, 105 are Evangelical (46.053%), 66 are Catholic (28.947%), 1 (0.439%) belongs to another religious group and 56 (24.561%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

===Mayor===
Daubach&#x27;s mayor is Harald Klotz.

===Coat of arms===
The German blazon reads: &quot;Ein rot-silberner geschachteter Schild, belegt mit einem grünen Wellenbalken.&quot;

The municipality&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Chequy of twenty gules and argent a fess wavy vert.

Since there is not much of a clue about the village&#x27;s local history, the municipality adopted the arms formerly borne by the “Hinder” County of Sponheim, but with the addition of a wavy fess (horizontal stripe). The former county&#x27;s “chequy” arms of course recall the village&#x27;s allegiance thereto in centuries gone by, and the fess is canting for the second syllable in Daubach&#x27;s name, &quot;Bach&quot; being the German word for “brook”.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===
The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:
* Evangelical church, Hauptstraße 44: Late Classicist sandstone quarrystone building, latter half of the 19th century
* In Hauptstraße 43, in the Catholic church&#x27;s new building: altar installation and baptismal font, both about 1750, three gravestones, late 18th century, from the demolished church at Rehbach

====Other buildings====
Successful transformations resulting from village renewal measures can be seen in various places in Daubach, for instance at the newly built belltower in the village centre. This was built in memory of the old town hall and a bakehouse with the original bell from 1719.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
Running by 8 km south of Daubach are &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 41 and the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken), on which is a station at Bad Sobernheim.

<doc id="994133" wikidata="Q898186" url="?curid=994133" title="Low Ki">
<text>Brandon Silvestry (born September 6, 1979) is an American professional wrestler of Italian and Puerto Rican descent, better known by his ring name Low Ki. He is known for his time with TNA Wrestling, Ring of Honor and Major League Wrestling as Low Ki and Senshi and with WWE as Kaval.

He is a one-time PWG World Champion, the inaugural ROH World Champion, one-time MLW World Heavyweight Champion and a three-time NWA World Tag Team Champion, and has won a number of tournaments and other championships on the independent circuit, and was the winner of the second season of &quot;NXT&quot; in 2010. Silvestry has also worked extensively in Japan, most notably for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he was a three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion, and Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero-One), where he was a one-time Zero-One International Junior Heavyweight and NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Champion. He is a three time world champion, and is the only wrestler in history to have been ROH, PWG, and MLW World Champion.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1998–2002) ===
Silvestry began wrestling in late 1998 under the ring name Low Ki, which he derived from the lyrics of the song &quot;No Diggity&quot;. He began wrestling for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) in 1998, challenging Homicide and Kane D for the JAPW Tag Team Championship. The following year he challenged for the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship twice, unsuccessfully, but defeated Crazy Ivan and Judas Young to win the second Best of the Light Heavyweights tournament.

In 2000, he began making several appearances in the World Wrestling Federation on their programs &quot;Metal&quot; and &quot;Jakked&quot;, where he competed against the likes of Raven, Crash Holly, Christian and Essa Ríos. The following year he made it through to the finals of All Pro Wrestling&#x27;s King of the Indies tournament, losing the crown to American Dragon. It was also during 2001 that he defeated Nick Berk and Homicide in separate matches on the same evening to win both the JAPW Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Titles; he would successfully defend both titles in separate matches at their Fourth Anniversary Show later that month in July. He lost both titles in a Three Way match the following month to Homicide, with Xavier as the other competitor.

=== Ring of Honor (2002–2006) ===

Low Ki made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut at its first show, The Era of Honor Begins, on February 23. In the show&#x27;s main event, he defeated Bryan Danielson and &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot; Christopher Daniels. On July 27, 2002, at Crowning a Champion, he became the first ever ROH Champion by defeating Daniels, Spanky and Doug Williams in a Four Way Ironman match. On August 24, Low Ki successfully defended his title against A.J. Styles. On September 21, at Unscripted, he lost the title to Xavier, who, after winning the title, became a member of Daniels&#x27;s faction The Prophecy. Low Ki then faced Samoa Joe on October 5 in what was Joe&#x27;s official ROH debut in a &quot;Fight Without Honor&quot;. In what resembled more of an MMA fight, Low Ki won the match and they shook hands after the match. Low Ki left the promotion in 2004 due to the Feinstein incident, but he returned on July 17, 2004, during a match, where Samoa Joe and the Briscoe Brothers fought against The Rottweilers (Homicide and the Havana Pitbulls). It looked like Low Ki would save Samoa Joe from a beatdown by The Rottweilers, but instead he spat on the ROH Championship, which was then held by Joe, and joined The Rottweilers.

At Weekend of Thunder Night 2 on November 6, 2004, he started a feud with Bryan Danielson, who was Low Ki&#x27;s partner in a match against Samoa Joe and Jushin Thunder Liger. Low Ki and Danielson lost the match and Low Ki blamed his partner for that, so The Rottweilers started a beatdown on Danielson. On December 4, at All Star Extravaganza II, Danielson defeated Homicide of The Rottweilers. In that same event, Low Ki wrestled Austin Aries in a number one contender&#x27;s match to determine who would face ROH Champion Samoa Joe for the title. The match ended in a draw. Officials extended the match, but Low Ki refused to wrestle, so Aries was declared the winner. Instead of facing Joe at Final Battle 2004, Low Ki wrestled Danielson, but got himself disqualified and then attacked the referee. This was enough for ROH officials to suspend him indefinitely as a result.

Low Ki returned on May 7, 2005, and immediately attacked Jay Lethal and Samoa Joe at Manhattan Mayhem with his fellow Rottweilers, Homicide, Julius Smokes, Monsta Mack and Rocky Romero. The impromptu tag team match was made: The Rottweilers vs. Samoa Joe and Jay Lethal. Low Ki and Homicide won the match and injured Lethal with a Ghetto Stomp/Cop Killa combination. The feud continued on June 18 at Death Before Dishonor III, where he and Lethal faced each other in a singles match, but it ended in a no contest. They had a rematch on August 12 at Redemption, but the ending was the same and Rottweilers beat Lethal down after the match. Finally, on September 17 at Glory By Honor IV, a &quot;Fight Without Honor&quot; between the two ended with Low Ki getting a pinfall victory over Lethal. After Samoa Joe went on to save Colt Cabana from a beatdown by The Rottweilers, Lethal came out to even the odds and said that he wanted yet another rematch with Low Ki, which Lethal won this time, ending the feud. Later in the year, Low Ki helped Homicide in his feud against Colt Cabana. On December 17, 2005, at Final Battle 2005, he challenged Kenta for his GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, but came up short. Low Ki left ROH once again in January 2006 due to a &quot;disagreement in business arrangements&quot;. He won his last match on January 28 against Jack Evans. ROH covered his leaving by having the ROH commissioner Jim Cornette ban Low Ki from Ring of Honor for life after it was discovered that he was the one who knocked Cornette&#x27;s tooth out at that show. He was also used as a focus point (in name only) in the Cornette/Homicide feud in the summer of 2006, with Cornette refusing to reinstate Low Ki as Homicide&#x27;s &quot;third wish.&quot;

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action (2002–2004) ===
Low Ki&#x27;s first stint with NWA Total Nonstop Action (NWA TNA) was for its debut show on June 19, 2002, in a six-man tag team match alongside A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn against the Flying Elvises. On June 26, he attempted to become the first X Division Champion, but was beaten by Styles. He would, though, eventually go on to win the title from Styles on August 7, but lost it three weeks later to Lynn. He would later form the Triple X faction with Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper that year and hold the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times under the &quot;Freebird Rule&quot;. Low Ki wrestled beside Skipper when Triple X defeated America&#x27;s Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) for the title on January 22, 2003. When Daniels&#x27;s greed for the X Division Championship initially forced Low Ki out of Triple X, Low Ki would go on to battle Daniels in Ultimate X, but his pursuit was unsuccessful. He left NWA TNA in July 2004 and made his return to ROH.

=== Japan (2002–2009) ===

Low Ki made his first trip to Japan with Pro Wrestling Zero-One in 2002. On September 16, he defeated Leonardo Spanky for the International Junior Heavyweight Championship from him. He held the championship until August 31, 2003, when he lost it to Wataru Sakata. During 2003, Low Ki also made several appearances for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW).

Low Ki left Zero-One in mid-2004 to join Pro Wrestling Noah, where he was instantly given a title shot against Global Honored Crown (GHC) Junior Heavyweight Champion Yoshinobu Kanemaru, which he was unable to win. During this period, he represented Noah in MXW Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Gaijin Battle Series. He later joined New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and joined Shinsuke Nakamura&#x27;s stable RISE, replacing the injured Milano Collection A.T.; in his first match back, he suffered a knee injury, which required surgery. Low Ki returned to the promotion in September, defecting from RISE to join New Japan&#x27;s main villainous faction, Great Bash Heel (GBH).

After joining GBH, he captured the International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) Junior Heavyweight Championship from Tiger Mask on September 21, 2008, on NJPW&#x27;s Circuit 2008 New Japan Generation tour. He subsequently lost it back to Tiger Mask on NJPW&#x27;s Wrestle Kingdom III show in Tokyo on January 4, 2009. After losing the championship, Low Ki made several appearances for Hustle.

=== Return to TNA (2006–2008) ===
At Lockdown, Christopher Daniels&#x27;s mystery opponent was revealed to be the returning Low Ki, who wrestled under the name of Senshi (Japanese for &quot;warrior&quot; or &quot;soldier&quot;). Following Lockdown, Senshi was not seen in action for several weeks. Instead, he was built up with a series of vignettes hyping his background, training, and desire to dominate the X Division once more, hinting at the possibility of challenging the X Division Champion, the undefeated Samoa Joe.

Senshi defeated Alex Shelley, Jay Lethal, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt at Slammiversary to become the number one contender to the X Division Championship. Senshi went on to become X Division Champion again on the June 22, 2006, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, defeating Joe and Dutt after he pinned Dutt. He remained undefeated for six months, successfully defending the X Division Championship against Kazarian at Victory Road, Jay Lethal and Petey Williams in a three-way match at Hard Justice, and Chris Sabin at No Surrender, before losing the title to Sabin in October at Bound for Glory.

Senshi later feuded with Austin Starr. Their feud would continue until Lockdown in a Six Sides of Steel match, which he won. At Slammiversary, he teamed with Rhino to defeat The Latin American Xchange (LAX). At Victory Road, Senshi competed in a 10-Man Ultimate X Match, which he lost. After the match, however, Triple X was reformed with Daniels, Senshi, and the returning Skipper. They won their reunion match on the July 19, 2007, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; against Serotonin.

Triple X faced Lethal and Dutt and The Motor City Machine Guns at Hard Justice in a losing effort. Skipper and Senshi also went on to face LAX at Bound for Glory in Ultimate X, ultimately losing.

At Turning Point, Senshi competed in the Feast or Fired match in which he one of four briefcases. On the following episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, it was revealed that Senshi&#x27;s case contained a pink slip which meant he was fired.

In December 2007, it was reported that Senshi had submitted his resignation to TNA and he left the promotion shortly after. In 2008, Silvestry helped TNA during the development of its first ever video game by providing both voicing and motion capture for the game&#x27;s protagonist, Suicide.

=== Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2007–2008, 2011) ===

Low Ki made his debut for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) on April 7, 2007, defeating Davey Richards at &quot;All Star Weekend V – Night One&quot;. On January 5, 2008, Low Ki won the PWG World Championship after defeating Bryan Danielson in an unannounced match. He had one successful title defense against El Generico, before a knee injury forced him to forfeit the championship just a month later.

Low Ki returned to PWG at &quot;All Star Weekend 7 – Night One&quot; on August 30, 2008, where he was a part of a four-way match for the World Championship; the bout also featured Eddie Kingston, Necro Butcher, and defending champion Chris Hero, who retained by pinning Kingston. On November 1 and 2 in Burbank, California, Low Ki defeated Roderick Strong in the opening round, Masato Yoshino in the quarterfinals, Nigel McGuinness in the semifinals, and Chris Hero in a non-title final match to win the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament.

After his World Wrestling Entertainment tenure, Low Ki returned to PWG on January 29, 2011, during the WrestleReunion 5 weekend, in a rematch from 2007, where he defeated Davey Richards. In his next appearance on April 9, Low Ki defeated Akira Tozawa. On May 28, during the second night of &quot;All Star Weekend 8&quot;, Low Ki unsuccessfully challenged Claudio Castagnoli for the World Championship.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2008–2010) ===
Low Ki appeared on the November 7, 2008, edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; in a dark match, losing to then-WWE Tag Team Champion Primo. Low Ki then won a match against Trent Beretta at the Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) tapings on January 8. It was later announced on his official website that he had signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Initially, he wrestled under the name Kawal – &quot;soldier&quot; in the Tagalog language – in FCW, WWE&#x27;s development territory, but later changed it to Kaval. In January 2009, he took a hiatus from FCW due to a leg injury, which would keep him sidelined until late October. On November 24, Kaval defeated Paul Burchill in a dark match prior to the SmackDown/ECW tapings. At the December 8 tapings, he was defeated by Goldust in another dark match. On the February 7 episode of &quot;FCW&quot;, he defeated Bryan Danielson, for whom this was a debut match, after hitting him with &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Way&quot;, and on February 8 won a fatal four-way match against Alberto Banderas, Wade Barrett and Michael Tarver to become the number one contender for the Florida Heavyweight Championship. Kaval received his title shot two weeks later, but was defeated by the defending champion, Justin Gabriel. On July 15, Kaval and Michael McGillicutty defeated &quot;Los Aviadores&quot; (Hunico and Epico) to win the Florida Tag Team Championship. Kaval and McGillicutty only held the championship for a single day before losing it back to &quot;Los Aviadores&quot;.
It was announced on June 1 that Kaval would be a participant in the second season of &quot;NXT&quot;, with Team Lay-Cool (Michelle McCool and Layla) as his storyline mentors. He debuted on the June 8 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, but did not compete in a match. On the June 15 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, he was defeated by Alex Riley in his debut, and the following week he was defeated by Eli Cottonwood. On the June 29 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Kaval teamed with Michael McGillicutty and Lucky Cannon against Riley, Cottonwood and Titus O&#x27;Neil, which his team won when he pinned Riley, giving Kaval his first win on &quot;NXT&quot;. Later that night, he was ranked first in the poll. Four weeks later on July 27, he slipped down to second place in the second poll, behind McGillicutty. On August 9, the rookies appeared in a six-man tag team match on Raw, which Kaval&#x27;s team lost when he was pinned by Husky Harris. Following the match, he was attacked by Sheamus. The following night on &quot;NXT&quot;, Kaval&#x27;s team won a rematch when Kaval pinned McGillicutty. In the poll later that night, Kaval regained the number one ranking. On the August 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kaval and Daniel Bryan lost a triple threat tag team match to The Miz and Alex Riley. On August 31, Kaval won the second season of &quot;NXT&quot;, with McGillicutty ranked second and Riley in third place.

=== Return to NJPW and second return to TNA (2011–2013) ===

On May 13, 2011, Silvestry, under the name Low Ki, made his return to NJPW, during the Invasion Tour 2011, the promotion&#x27;s first tour of the United States, teaming with Homicide in a tag team match, where they defeated Jushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask. The following day, Low Ki unsuccessfully challenged Prince Devitt for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship.

On April 21, 2012, Low Ki returned to NJPW, aligning himself with the Chaos stable and teaming with Gedo, Jado and Rocky Romero in an eight-man tag team match, where they defeated Jushin Thunder Liger, Prince Devitt, Ryusuke Taguchi and Tiger Mask, with Ki pinning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Devitt for the win. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2012, Low Ki defeated Devitt to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On May 27, Low Ki entered New Japan&#x27;s 2012 Best of the Super Juniors tournament.

Low Ki had told New Japan office that he did not want to wrestle at an upcoming event in Fukushima because of health and safety reasons stemming from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Low Ki wrestled the WK7 match in the suit in protest. NJPW was reportedly &quot;furious&quot; over Low Ki wrestling a title match in a suit without clearing it with them first to the point that even years later, the company was said to be open to bringing anyone back &quot;with the exception of Low Ki&quot;.

On June 25, 2015, Low Ki announced that he had parted ways with the company.

=== Fourth return to Impact (2017) ===
On the April 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Low Ki made his return, debuting a Hitman / Agent 47 inspired gimmick. He defeated Trevor Lee, Andrew Everett, Sonjay Dutt, Dezmond Xavier and Suicide in a six-way match to win his fifth Impact Wrestling X Division Championship. As champion, he would make appearances in the United Kingdom, defeating Mark Haskins for 4 Front Wrestling and Ultimo Tiger for Pro Wrestling Pride.

After that, he was joined with the Latin American Xchange (LAX), starting a storyline with the Impact World Champion Alberto El Patron. Ki was scheduled to face Alberto for the title at Bound for Glory, but since Impact stripped him from the title, the match was cancelled. Instead, Eli Drake was crowned new champion and Johnny Impact was pointed as the challenger at Bound for Glory. On August 23, it was reported that Silvestry had parted ways with Impact. Sources agreed that Silvestry had made the decision to leave, but disagreed whether the departure was over financial or creative differences.

He would hold the title 205 days, losing it to Tom Lawlor at SuperFight on February 2, 2019.

<text>The Visitors&#x27; Gallery, formerly known as the Strangers&#x27; Gallery, is set aside for members of the public at the British House of Commons, and is intended for both invited and uninvited members of the public to watch the proceedings of the House. A similar gallery exists in the House of Lords.

The gallery of the House of Commons is located on a level above the floor of the Commons chamber and looks down on it. The section of the gallery above the Speaker&#x27;s chair is reserved for members of the press, while the area set aside for members of the general public is situated above the entrance to the chamber. There is a glass screen at the front of the public area of the gallery to prevent the throwing of objects into the chamber, which was installed in April 2004 at the cost of £600,000.

Members of the public may obtain tickets from their Member of Parliament. It is possible to queue outside St Stephen&#x27;s Tower and be admitted to the gallery without booking, especially on Fridays, however during popular debates it will be nearly impossible to obtain a place without booking. The former name &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Gallery&quot; refers to the traditional use of the term &quot;strangers&quot; to refer to those present in Parliament that are neither members nor staff.

Other parliaments throughout the Commonwealth have similar facilities, which are known by the same terms.

<text>Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist–Leninist) was created through the merger of Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, Northern Zone Committee RCUC(M-L), West Bengal Communist Unity Centre and West Bengal Co-ordination Committee of Revolutionaries (WBCCR). The formation took place at a unity conference in April 1975. The unity conference adopted a resolution on martyrs, programme, path, method of work, constitution and a statement on unification. The unity conference elected a Central Committee with [[Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist–Leninist)|Devulapalli Venkateswara Rao]] as its secretary. UCCRI(ML) had as its ambition to unite all communist revolutionary forces, including people within the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)) fold. UCCRI(ML) started publishing the SPARK as its central organ.

== Overview ==

Shortly after the formation of UCCRI(ML), the State of Emergency was proclaimed by the Indira Gandhi regime. UCCRI(ML) was proscribed and forced underground.

There was a decision on behalf of the Kerala Communist Unity Centre to merge with UCCRI(ML) in June 1975, but that organization suffered internal splits and the merged was cancelled.

In July 1976 T. Nagi Reddy, who had been the most important leader of the party, died. His death became a severe set-back for UCCRI(ML). In August the same year the organization suffered a split. A conflict had emerged in the CC, and D. V. Rao had been removed from the post of secretary. D. V. Rao accused three other CC members (led by a CC member from the NZC) of having formed a &quot;rival centre&quot;, and suspended them unilaterally. In the split the Northern Zone Committee (i.e., Rajasthan) and Bengal Committee had broken away, along with the &quot;rival centre&quot;. The break-away group later developed a pro-Albanian line.

D. V. Rao returned to Andhra Pradesh and rallied the Andhra organization around him. D. V. Rao pushed through a merger of the Punjab Communist Revolutionary Committee with the UCCRI(ML) in June 1976. He resurrected a Central Committee including himself, the PCRC secretary Harbhajan Sohi and two leaders from Andhra (Madhu and Anand), which was to function until a regular conference would be held.

UCCRI(ML) of D. V. Rao later evaluated the split in the following way:

From whatever the discussion that had taken place, we can draw some conclusions.

1. Excepting on two issues, there reflected no divergencies in the CC on political positions adopted by Com. D. V. Rao in the course of whole development.

2. Com. D. V. Rao viewed the whole course of development like this: The NZC and its allies did not accept the line with convictions and genuinity. This was the basic cause for the split. They were manipulators, careerists and doubtful elements. They were incorrigible. Hence the split was unavoidable sooner or later.

Branches were started in Orissa and Kerala. In 1978 a group from the Debra area of Midnapore, West Bengal joined UCCRI(ML) after some rounds of discussions with the CC. The convenor of the erstwhile Maharashtra State Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (which had left All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries after the expulsion of Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries) joined UCCRI(ML), leading to the formation of a unit in Maharashtra.

UCCRI(ML) split for the second time in September 1979 when the Punjab committee, under the leadership of Harbhajan Sohi, broke away. HBS had developed a criticism of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Three Worlds Theory. D. V. Rao, on the other hand, defended the Three Worlds Theory and the new leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Punjab committee came to establish a parallel UCCRI(ML).

Ahead of the 1980 elections, UCCRI(ML) reviewed their stand towards participation. UCCRI(ML) always saw the issue of elections as a tactical issue. Initially the party had taken the policy of non-participation. But in 1980 UCCRI(ML) came out with an appeal to &quot;defeat pro-super power reactionary forces in elections&quot;. An article written by D. V. Rao in the January 1980 issue of Proletarian Line (the central organ of UCCRI(ML) at the time) proposed the following:

We have been treating and are treating the participation or boycott... as a form of struggle and our practice is the same. We do not think that &quot;boycott&quot; can be the slogan of present day... In the same way it is too premature to think of candidates in the prevailing situation in which the defective nature of electoral system is one. In these conditions our participation will be one of taking measures to advance the revolutionary movement by utilizing this opportunity. The people are being mobilised to see the real face of contesting parties who have not been serving them in any way what so ever.&lt;br&gt;

Keeping all the points in view, we appeal to the people to defeat the game of the two super powers in general and Soviet Union in particular. We appeal to people to defeat the game of landlords who are trying to survive by diverting the agrarian revolutionary movement. Almost all the election parties are connected with these forces in one way or the other.

The article continues; &quot;Since pro-super power and reactionary forces in general and pro-Soviet forces in particular pose the main danger to our country we will mobilse all those forces who are opposed to them and see that they are strengthened so that they are able to defeat them as far as possible. In this connection, we ask the people to differentiate between genuine and fake anti-Soviet, democratic forces.&quot;

In the actual electoral campaign, however, the new policy was not consistent. In Andhra Pradesh the party promoted non-participation, in reality a boycott, whereas the party supported certain candidates in West Bengal and Orissa. In the aftermath of the elections, a split surged with D. V. Rao leaving the party with a group of followers in Andhra. D. V. Rao set up his own UCCRI(ML). After D. V. Rao&#x27;s departure, Anand became the new CC Secretary of the remaining UCCRI(ML).

In 1988 Anand broke away from UCCRI(ML) after a long period of dissent in the organization. The rift between Anand and other surged in the preparations to hold a party conference. Anand was able to win over the Maharashtra unit. Anand also reopened relations with Sohi&#x27;s UCCRI(ML). After the split, the faction of Anand together with Sohis faction created the Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India together with three other groups the same year.

The remaining UCCRI(ML) faction, led by Viswam and Madhu, merged into the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti in 1992. Madhu signed the merger agreement on behalf of UCCRI(ML).

<text>Ostmark (, &quot;Eastern March&quot;) was a name that referred historically to the Margraviate of Austria, a medieval frontier march. It was also used in Nazi propaganda from 1938 to 1942 to refer to the formerly independent Federal State of Austria after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Nazi Germany. From the &quot;Anschluss&quot; until 1939, the official name used was Land Österreich (&quot;State of Austria&quot;).

==History==
Once Adolf Hitler completed the union between Austria and Germany &quot;(Anschluss)&quot;, the Nazi government renamed the incorporated territory. The name &quot;Austria&quot; (&quot;Österreich&quot; in German, meaning &quot;Eastern Realm&quot;) was at first replaced by &quot;Ostmark&quot;, referring to the 10th century &quot;Marcha orientalis&quot;. The change was meant to refer to Austria as the new &quot;eastern march&quot; of the Reich.

==Subdivisions==
According to the &quot;Ostmarkgesetz&quot; with effect from 1 May 1939, the former States of Austria were reorganized into seven of the German Reich, each under the rule of a government official holding the dual offices of &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (governor) and &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (Nazi Party leader):
*Carinthia, including East Tyrol; increased by Slovenian Carinthia and Upper Carniola as occupied territories after the 1941 Balkans Campaign
*&quot;Lower Danube&quot; (&quot;Niederdonau&quot;), name for Lower Austria, with its capital at Krems an der Donau, including the northern districts of Burgenland with Eisenstadt, the South Moravian territories around Znojmo (&quot;Deutsch-Südmähren&quot;) annexed with the Sudetenland according to the 1938 Munich Agreement and also the Bratislava boroughs of Petržalka (Engerau) and Devín (Theben)
*Salzburg
*Styria, including the southern districts of Burgenland; increased by Lower Styria as occupied territory after the 1941 Balkans Campaign
*&quot;Upper Danube&quot; (&quot;Oberdonau&quot;), name for Upper Austria, including the Styrian Aussee region (&quot;Ausseerland&quot;) and the South Bohemian territories around Český Krumlov annexed with the &quot;Sudetenland&quot; according to the 1938 Munich Agreement
*Tyrol, i.e. North Tyrol, with the administrative district of Vorarlberg
*Vienna, i.e. &quot;Greater Vienna&quot;, including several surrounding Lower Austrian municipalities incorporated in 1938.
A &quot;Reichsgau&quot; was a new, simple administrative sub-division institution which replaced the federal states in the otherwise completely centralized Third Reich. From April 8, 1942, as the term &quot;Ostmark&quot; was still too reminiscent of the old, independent state of Austria, the chosen official name for the seven entities was Alpen- und Donau-Reichsgaue (&quot;Danubian and Alpine Reichsgaue&quot;). In the course of the Allied occupation after World War II, the Austrian state was restored in its pre-1938 borders according to the 1943 Moscow Declaration.

<text>Mehdi Akhavān-Sāles, or Akhavān-Sāless () (March 1, 1929 in Mashhad, Iran – August 26, 1990 in Tehran, Iran), pen name Mim. Omid (, meaning &quot;M. Hope&quot;) was a prominent Iranian poet. He is one of the pioneers of Free Verse (&quot;New Style Poetry&quot;) in the Persian language.

==Biography==
&quot;Mehdi Akhavan Sales&quot; was born on 1 March 1929, in Mashhad, Khorasan Province. His father, Ali, was originally from Fahraj in Yazd, he was an apothecary (ʿaṭṭār), and his mother, Maryam, was a native of Khorasan. 
Akhavan Sales had to give up an interest in music to appease his father. He finished his elementary education in Mashhad and studied welding in the city&#x27;s Technical School (honarestān) in 1941. It was in Mashhad that he was familiarized with the elementary principles of classical Persian prosody by one of his instructors in the technical school in Mashad, named Parviz Kāviān Jahromi, (Akhavan, 2003c, p. 386). Afterwards, Akhavan soon found his way to the literary circles of Mashad. One of the most notable of these circles was the Khorasan Literary Society. He chose M. Omid (Omid means hope) as his pen name and as he grew older, he began to play with the meaning of his poetic name with a sense of irony. 
Akhavan, along with a few others, formed Bahār, a literary circle more in tune with modernist trends in poetry. Later he became involved in leftist politics and a member of the provincial committee of the recently established Youth Organization of the Tudeh Party. 
Following his education, Akhavan moved to Tehran (1949) and worked as a teacher. He married his cousin Ḵadijeh (Irān) in 1950 and they had six children: Laleh, Luli, Tus, Tanasgol, Zardošt, and Mazdak ʿAli.
Akhavan’s first collection of poetry, Arḡanun (The organ; Figure 3), was published in 1951 and when the government of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was toppled by a coup, he took part in political activities and was imprisoned along with Nima Yooshij and other activists.

Akhavan’s second poetry collection named Zemestān (Winter) was published in 1956. After his release from prison in 1957, he started to work in radio, and soon after was transferred to Khouzestan to work in TV. Later on, he taught literature on radio and TV and at the university. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution he was granted membership to the Iranian Academy of Artists and Writers. In 1981 he was forced to retire from government service without pay. In 1990, following an invitation from the cultural organization in Germany, he traveled abroad for the first time. Few months after his return, he died in Tehran. He is buried on the grounds of the mausoleum of Ferdowsi in Tus.

==Poetry==
Although Akhavan Sales&#x27;s poetic career began as early as 1942, he did not acquire a degree that recognized his achievements, which was necessary for breaking into literary circles, in his time; however, this changed when he published his third volume of poetry in 1956, entitled &quot;Zemestan&quot; (Winter); this volume boosted Sales&#x27;s career and placed him among the top runners for the mantle of Nima Yushij. In fact, within many circles, Nader Naderpour and Akhavan Sales were equally recognized as worthy successors of the Bard of Mazandaran. The fact that, like Nima, both poets had begun as traditionalists and then worked their way into new realms of New Poetry (sic) through individual initiative itself, both deserved praise for singular effort (why single one out when two can hold the same title at once?).

Akhavan&#x27;s forte, like the bard of Tus, Ferdowsi, is epic; more precisely, he chooses themes of epical proportion and expresses them with the same zeal that Ferdowsi uses in the Shahnameh. The difference is that they wrote for diametrically opposed audiences. Akhavan Sales was free from involving his poetry in &#x27;gavel by gavel&#x27; battles with Iranian and Turanian &#x27;political&#x27; magistrates; on the contrary, he could focus on the themes and illustrating aspects of life with diverse, often far-fetched similes, metaphors, and symbols (without concerning himself, that is, with political consequences).

Sales&#x27;s language is complex. While translating his verse, one cannot ignore the impact of the internal rhythm, the interconnection of seemingly disparate images, and the ubiquitous presence of his thematic focus. Sales&#x27;s &quot;Winter,&quot; for example, displays his understanding the depth of his philosophic convictions and, at the same time, the dexterity and finesse that distinguishes his writing. Iraj Bashiri&#x27;s translation gives us the English equivalent:

As Abdolali Dastgheib, literary critic writer puts it: Mehdi Akhavan-Sales benefitted from ancient treasures of Persian literature and was able to skillfully combine the old, traditional style with modern or even, everyday words to create some of the best works of Iranian poetry. His later works have a rich style and are a symbolic portrait of political and social atmosphere of the time. For example, his famous poem ‘Winter (Zemestān زمستان, 1956)’ which was written shortly following the coup against Iranian popular and liberal prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, and the suppression of freedom by the Shah’s government, shows his despair and loss of hope. In this poem, even close friends are not extending hands to each other or talking as “the cold is severely bitter”.
Mehdi Akhavan Sales is one of the best contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of Free Verse (New Style Poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics who has introduced a fresh style into Persian poetry.

<text>Nuufolau Joel &quot;Joe&quot; Seanoa (born March 17, 1979), known by the ring name Samoa Joe, is an American professional wrestler, voice actor, and film and television actor. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is a member of the Opps. He is a former two-time AEW TNT Champion and one-time AEW World Champion.

Debuting in 1999, Joe joined Ring of Honor (ROH) soon after its formation in 2002, going on to hold the ROH World Championship for a record 21 months from March 2003 to December 2004 as well as holding the ROH Pure Championship. At Slammiversary in June 2005, he joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he embarked on a 19-month-long undefeated streak that ended in a critically acclaimed feud with Kurt Angle. During his 10-year stint in TNA, he held the TNA World Heavyweight Championship once, the TNA X Division Championship five times, the TNA World Tag Team Championship twice, and the TNA Television Championship once.

After departing TNA in 2015, Joe began wrestling for WWE on its NXT brand. After winning the NXT Championship twice, he joined the main roster in January 2017, going on to win the WWE United States Championship on two occasions and headline several WWE pay-per-views and livestreaming supercards. In 2019, he began working as a color commentator due to accumulated injuries. He was released from his contract in April 2021, but was rehired that June, winning the NXT Championship a third time before being released once again in January 2022.

Joe was named part of the inaugural class of the ROH Hall of Fame in January 2022, and three months later made his debut in AEW, and concurrently returned to ROH, which by then was AEW&#x27;s sister promotion following its purchase by AEW co-owner/chief executive officer Tony Khan. In AEW/ROH, Joe held the AEW TNT Championship twice and the ROH World Television Championship once (at one time holding both titles simultaneously) and set a new record for the longest reign as ROH Television Champion. He then defeated MJF for the AEW World Championship in December 2023, making him the only wrestler to have held the AEW, ROH, and TNA World Championships.

Outside of wrestling, Seanoa is an actor and voice actor; he is known for playing Sweet Tooth in the 2023 television series &quot;Twisted Metal,&quot; voicing King Shark in the 2024 video game &quot;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&quot; and lending both appearance and voice to antagonist Raymond Law in &quot;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.&quot;

== Early life ==
Seanoa was born on March 17, 1979 to Pete and Portia Seanoa. He was raised in Orange County, California. As a child, Seanoa performed for &quot;Tiare Productions&quot;, a Polynesian dance troupe founded by his parents in 1965. At the age of five, Seanoa performed in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He became a California State Junior Judo Champion and was an all league football player while attending Ocean View High School. Seanoa attended college, where he played football. Before becoming a wrestler, he worked as a mortgage broker.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1999–2001) ===
Seanoa became involved in professional wrestling after attending a Jiu-Jitsu class and being encouraged by instructors to attend a professional wrestling school taking place afterwards, whereupon he &quot;fell in love with it&quot; and began training regularly. Seanoa attended the United Independent Wrestling Alliance (UIWA) West Coast Dojo, where he trained under Cincinnati Red, Johnny Hemp and, occasionally, John Delayo. He debuted in December 1999 in a match against &quot;Uncle&quot; Jess Hansen three months after beginning his training, adopting the ring name &quot;Samoa Joe&quot;. In 2000, Joe began appearing with the California-based Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) promotion, then a developmental affiliate of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), after being scouted by Brett Wagner. While in UPW, Joe feuded with John Cena and held the UPW No Holds Barred Championship from March to April 2001. He was named Southern California&#x27;s Rookie of the Year for 2000. In February 2001, he appeared on an episode of &quot;WWF Jakked&quot;, losing to Essa Rios; he was subsequently told by WWF personnel that he &quot;didn&#x27;t have a future in [the WWF]&quot;. In March 2001, Joe defeated Christopher Daniels to win the UPW Heavyweight Championship; he held the title for a record 258 days before losing to Mikey Henderson in November 2001. In October 2001, Joe competed in All Pro Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;King of Indies&quot; tournament that was won by American Dragon.

=== Pro Wrestling Zero-One (2001–2003) ===
As part of a working arrangement between Ultimate Pro Wrestling and Shinya Hashimoto&#x27;s Pro Wrestling Zero-One promotion, Joe made his first appearance in Japan in June 2001 during Pro Wrestling Zero-One&#x27;s &quot;Shingeki&quot; pay-per-view. In his debut match he teamed with Keiji Sakoda to defeat Katsumi Usuda and Yuki Ishikawa to become the inaugural Intercontinental Tag Team Champions; the titles were awarded to Mike Rapada and Steve Corino the following month. Joe went on to take part in the 2001 Fire Festival, finishing second in his block with four points after defeating George Takano and Masato Tanaka but losing to Kohei Sato.

Joe returned to Pro Wrestling Zero-One in January 2002, where Masato Tanaka and Shinjiro Otani defeated him and Tom Howard to win the vacant Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. He continued to work for the promotion throughout 2002, participating in a number of its biggest shows and tournaments as &quot;Samoa Joe&quot; and later &quot;King Joe&quot;. He tagged with several other American wrestlers, including Samoan Savage. Joe took part in the 2002 Fire Festival, finishing last in his block with two points after defeating Kintaro Kanemura but losing to TAKA Michinoku, Masato Tanaka, and eventual overall winner Shinjiro Otani.

Joe made his final appearances with Pro Wrestling Zero-One in August 2003 as part of its &quot;Summer Festival 2003&quot; tour. Wrestling as &quot;King Joe&quot;, he competed in a series of tag team matches and six-man tag team matches, including teaming with King Adamo to unsuccessfully challenge Kohei Sato and Hirotaka Yokoi for the All Asia Tag Team Championship.

=== Independent circuit (2001–2015) ===
Joe wrestled for many independent promotions from 2001 to 2015, including IWA Mid-South, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, the United Wrestling Federation, Full Impact Pro, and Major League Wrestling. In 2004, Joe won IWA Mid-South&#x27;s Revolution Strong Style Tournament. In 2006, Joe won the Twin Wrestling Entertainment Championship and the Ballpark Brawl Natural Heavyweight Championship. In the same year, he won the Extreme Wrestling Federation&#x27;s Xtreme 8 Tournament.

=== Ring of Honor (2002–2007, 2008, 2015) ===
In 2002, Samoa Joe joined the ranks of the nascent Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), which had been impressed by his work in Japan and on the United States independent circuit. He debuted in October 2002 at &quot;Glory By Honor&quot; as Christopher Daniels&#x27;s &quot;hired assassin&quot;, brought in to defeat Daniels&#x27;s chief enemy, Low Ki. Originally booked for a single match against Low Ki, Joe impressed fans with his extremely stiff and hard-hitting style that resembled a mixed martial arts fighter more than a wrestler, resulting in ROH booking him full-time.

Joe quickly rose through the ranks and became ROH Champion by defeating Xavier at Night of Champions in March 2003. After he defeated The Zebra Kid at &quot;Frontiers of Honor&quot; in London, England in May 2003, the title was renamed the ROH World Championship. Joe held the title for a record 645 days, defending the title 29 times in the United States and in Europe. During this time, he had a critically acclaimed trilogy of title defenses against CM Punk (the second of which received a &quot;five star&quot; rating from veteran journalist Dave Meltzer, the first match in the United States in seven years to do so). In October 2003, Joe faced Ares in a bout promoted by the German Wrestling Association in Bad Schwalbach, Germany with both Joe&#x27;s ROH World Championship and the vacant GWA Heavyweight Championship on the line, defeating Ares to win the GWA Heavyweight Championship (the title was deactivated later that year). In March 2004, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Championship against Ahmed Chaer in a bout promoted by German Stampede Wrestling in Lennestadt in Germany. In June 2004, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Championship against Shinya Makabe in a bout promoted by New Japan Pro-Wrestling at the Inoki Dojo in Santa Monica, California. Joe&#x27;s reign finally ended after 645 days when he lost to Austin Aries at Final Battle in December 2004.

Soon after losing the ROH World Championship to Aries, Joe became the ROH Pure Champion by defeating his on-screen protégé Jay Lethal in May 2005. He lost the title to Nigel McGuinness at &quot;Dragon Gate Invasion&quot; in August 2005. In October 2005, when Japanese heavyweight superstar Kenta Kobashi made a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; trip to the United States, he was signed to two Ring of Honor shows. ROH officials selected Joe to face him in a singles match on the first night and a tag match on the second. Joe proved to be a formidable opponent for Kobashi, in a back and forth match, which Dave Meltzer again gave a five-star rating. The match went on to win the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; award for &quot;Match of the Year&quot;, with the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; also naming Joe &quot;Most Outstanding Wrestler&quot; for 2005. In 2015, the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; described the match as being &quot;widely considered one of the company&#x27;s defining moments&quot;.

In 2006, Joe was one of the principal wrestlers representing Ring of Honor in their war against rival Philadelphia promotion Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). The war culminated in a five-on-five &quot;Cage of Death&quot; match at &quot;Death before Dishonor IV&quot; in July 2006. Joe helped ROH dominate in the match, until, after picking up CZW wrestler Chris Hero for the muscle buster, he was attacked by fellow ROH wrestler Bryan Danielson. Danielson repeatedly hit Joe&#x27;s injured knee with a steel chair, forcing him to quit the match. Joe was later replaced in the match by Homicide, who went on to win the match for ROH. At the September 16, 2006 ROH show, Joe got into an argument and pull-apart brawl with Pro Wrestling Noah star Takeshi Morishima. Subsequently, a match was signed for February 2007 pitting Joe against Morishima which Joe won. Joe later teamed with Homicide to fight against the Briscoes, and, like Homicide, found himself back in the ROH World Championship hunt. Joe, however, came up short against champion Bryan Danielson in several matches, including a match that ended in a time limit drawn after 60 minutes and a cage match in December 2006.

Joe ceased to be a full-time performer in ROH on March 4, 2007. His appearances leading up to that date were billed as the &quot;Samoa Joe Farewell Tour&quot;. On March 4, he defeated long-time rival Homicide in the Liverpool Olympia in Liverpool, England in his final ROH match. On November 22, 2008, Joe made a one night return to ROH at Rising Above (its second every pay-per-view), defeating Tyler Black in a dark match.

After departing Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in February 2015, Samoa Joe briefly returned to ROH the following month. After defeating Kyle O&#x27;Reilly, ACH, and Michael Elgin in successive matches, Joe unsuccessfully challenged ROH World Champion Jay Briscoe in the main event of Supercard of Honor IX on March 27. On June 20, Joe teamed with AJ Styles to defeat ROH World Tag Team Champions Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian in a non-title match. Joe subsequently left Ring of Honor once again.

=== Inoki Dojo (2004) ===
In 2004, Joe appeared with Inoki Dojo, an American offshoot of New Japan Pro-Wrestling based in Santa Monica, California. He made his first appearance in April 2004, teaming with Bobby Quance in a loss to Aaron Aguilera and American Dragon, then later that month wrestled Aguilera to a time limit draw. Joe made a handful of appearances with Inoki Dojo in June and July 2004, including successfully defending the ROH World Championship against Shinya Makabe. Joe made his final appearance with Inoki Dojo in December 2004, teaming with Chad Malenko in a loss to Katsushi Takemura and Osamu Nishimura.

==== Undefeated streak; feud with Kurt Angle (2005–2007) ====
After being courted by both Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Joe signed a contract with TNA in June 2005. He debuted later that month at Slammiversary, defeating Sonjay Dutt. Joe subsequently entered the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, defeating Sonjay Dutt and Alex Shelley before defeating AJ Styles in the tournament finals at Sacrifice in August 2005 following interference from Christopher Daniels. As a result of Daniels&#x27; interference, TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko booked a three-way match for Daniels&#x27; X Division Championship at Unbreakable in September 2005. The match was won by Styles, though Joe&#x27;s undefeated streak remained intact as it was Daniels who was pinned. The match received an elusive &quot;five star&quot; rating from journalist Dave Meltzer. At Bound for Glory in October 2005, Joe defeated New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s Jushin Liger.

Joe defeated Styles to win the X Division Championship at Turning Point in December 2005. At Final Resolution in January 2006, Joe defended the championship against Daniels, winning by technical knockout. At Against All Odds in February 2006, Joe defeated Daniels and Styles in a rematch from Unbreakable to retain the title. At Destination X in March 2006, Joe lost the title to Daniels in an Ultimate X match (a match in which there is no pinfall or submission, thus preserving Joe&#x27;s undefeated streak).

On the April 13, 2006 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe defeated Christopher Daniels to win the X Division Championship for a second time.

At Victory Road in July 2006, Joe, Steiner, Sting, and Christian Cage took part in a four-way match to determine the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship; the match ended when Sting pinned Steiner. At No Surrender in September 2006, Joe defeated Jeff Jarrett in a non-title &quot;fan&#x27;s revenge lumberjack match&quot;. After the match, he took Jarrett&#x27;s title belt. On the October 12 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe agreed to return the belt to the winner of the forthcoming bout between Jarrett and Sting at Bound for Glory on the condition that the winner give him a title shot. This offer was turned down by TNA Management Director Jim Cornette, who gave Joe the choice of returning the title or be fired. After Joe again refused to return the belt, he got into a brawl with the debuting Kurt Angle, allowing Jarrett to retrieve the belt. At Bound for Glory later that month, Joe defeated Abyss, Brother Runt, and Raven in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match after guest referee Jake Roberts performed a DDT on Raven, allowing Joe to defeat Raven. Later that night, Joe was involved in a pull-apart brawl with Angle after Cornette announced that he would be fired if he interfered in the match between Jarrett and Sting that involved Angle as special enforcer. At Genesis in November 2006, Joe lost to Angle after submitting to Angle&#x27;s ankle lock. This ended his 18-month undefeated streak.

On the July 12 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe defeated Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin to win the X Division Championship. His victory entitled him to take part in the &quot;Match of Champions&quot; at Victory Road later that month; during the Match of Champions, Joe pinned Brother Ray to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, making him the first wrestler in TNA to simultaneously hold multiple TNA championships. He opted to hold the Championship by himself rather than choosing a tag team partner. At Hard Justice in August 2007, Joe put up the X Division Championship the TNA World Tag Team Championship against Kurt Angle&#x27;s TNA World Heavyweight Championship and IWGP Heavyweight Championship, losing the match (and both his titles) thanks to interference by Karen Angle.

At Turning Point in December 2007, Joe was scheduled to team with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall to face the Angle Alliance. However, Hall, no-showed the event. Before the match, Joe was asked to cut a promo introducing Eric Young as Hall&#x27;s replacement. Joe went five minutes overtime and criticized Hall, Nash and several other wrestlers, legitimately angering Nash and TNA president Dixie Carter, The match saw Joe, Nash, and Young defeat the Angle Alliance when Joe pinned Tomko. After the match, Joe and Nash briefly argued and shoved one another backstage, with Joe apologizing at a talent meeting the following day. The incident was parlayed into a storyline where Joe directed his frustrations towards TNA management, After complaining to TNA Management Director Jim Cornette that he did not have a match at Final Resolution in January 2008, Cornette scheduled a match pitting Joe and Nash against TNA World Tag Team Champions AJ Styles and Tomko. The match saw Nash refuse to tag himself in, leading to Styles and Tomko defeating Joe.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2008) ====
At Against All Odds in February 2008, Joe served as the special enforcer for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between champion Kurt Angle and challenger Christian Cage. During the match, AJ Styles interfered and fought Joe away from the ring, enabling Tomko to interfere to help Angle win the match.

At Lockdown in April 2008, Joe defeated Angle in a title versus career match to win his first and only TNA World Championship. Writing in 2015, the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; described the bout between Angle and Joe as &quot;arguably the company&#x27;s peak in terms of creative, match quality, business, and production coming together&quot;.

At No Surrender in September 2008, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Kurt Angle in a three way match to retain his title.

During the match, Joe suffered an injury after landing back-first on a flight of cement stairs while executing a dropkick; the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; stated that subsequently Joe &quot;was never the same [...] His work noticeably slowed down, he gained weight&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, Kyle Johnson stated &quot;Joe’s standing as a main event star in the company entered a downward spiral from 2009 on and never recovered. His TNA World Heavyweight Championship run was almost completely unmemorable, ending at Bound for Glory 2008 in a match where he attempted a dropkick from a press box onto concrete stairs to horrifying effect. Joe was truly never the same after that bump.&quot;

==== Front Line; Main Event Mafia (2008–2009) ====
On the October 30, 2008 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe and AJ Styles formed a faction of younger wrestlers called the &quot;Front Line&quot;, to oppose the Main Event Mafia of Kurt Angle, Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner. At Turning Point in November 2008, Nash defeated Joe by cheating. At Final Resolution in December 2008, the Front Line lost to the Main Event Mafia in an eight man tag team match. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe and Styles defeated Sting and Nash in a Six Sides of Steel match.

After being off TV for several weeks, Joe returned on the February 4 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, attacking Styles. At Against All Odds later that month, Joe unsuccessfully challenged Styles in a no disqualification match refereed by Eric Bischoff. On the following episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Joe was attacked and abducted by &quot;ninjas&quot;.

Joe returned on the April 19, 2020 episode of &quot;Impact&quot; as the surprise partner of &quot;Team Hogan&quot; (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, and Rob Terry) in an eight-man tag team match against &quot;Team Flair&quot; (Desmond Wolfe, James Storm, Robert Roode, and Sting); his abduction never was explained. In the following weeks, Joe randomly attacked wrestlers including Brian Kendrick, Douglas Williams, and Matt Morgan. In May 2010, Joe was ranked number 10 in the inaugural TNA Championship Committee rankings to determine the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Joe subsequently climbed the rankings, ultimately wrestling number two ranked Jeff Hardy to a 10-minute time limit draw on the July 22 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;. After the match with Hardy, Joe was upset with TNA&#x27;s production crew for displaying a countdown to the time limit draw which Joe had specifically requested not be done to avoid spoiling the ending of the match; the &quot;blow-up&quot; resulted in Joe being suspended from TNA.

==== Various feuds; losing streak (2010–2011) ====
Joe returned from his suspension in August 2010, aligning himself with Hulk Hogan and Jeff Jarrett in their feud with Kevin Nash and Sting. At No Surrender in September 2010, Joe and Jarrett defeated Nash and Sting in a tag team match. At Bound for Glory in October 2010, Joe and Jarrett faced Nash, Sting, and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero in a handicap match after Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Joe and Jarrett, pulled out of the match due to injury.

At Turning Point in November 2010, Jarrett defeated Joe after choking him out with a baton following interference from Immortal. The following month at Final Resolution, Joe lost to Jarrett in a submission match, again following interference from Immortal.

After losing all nine of his matches in the 2011 Bound for Glory Series to determine the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Joe initially ended his losing streak on the August 4 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; by defeating D&#x27;Angelo Dinero via submission; however, the decision was reversed after Joe refused to release the Coquina Clutch after the bell rang. Joe then gave a promo in which he accused TNA management of being against him and stated &quot;the blood would be on [their] hands&quot;. Joe went on to attempt to disrupt the Bound for Glory Series by attacking various participants, including Crimson, who was forced to withdraw from the Series after suffering a storyline ankle injury at the hands of Joe. In the final week of the Bound for Glory Series, Joe attempted to interfere in a match between Gunner and Rob Van Dam, but was stopped by guest color commentator Matt Morgan. This led to a grudge match at No Surrender in September 2011 where Joe lost to Morgan. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Joe definitively ended his losing streak by defeating Morgan in a submission match. Joe then resumed his feud with the returning Crimson, who defeated Joe in a singles match on the October 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, and then again in a three-way match, also involving Matt Morgan, at Bound for Glory later that month.

==== World Tag Team Champion; Television Champion (2011–2012) ====

On October 25, 2007, Joe made his debut for the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah as part of its &quot;Autumn Navigation&quot; tour. Wrestling in Yokohama, he teamed with Yoshihiro Takayama to defeat Mitsuharu Misawa and Takeshi Morishima. Two days later, Joe challenged Misawa for the GHC Heavyweight Championship in a one-on-one match at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, losing by pinfall after Misawa struck the back of Joe&#x27;s head with his elbow.

On July 22, 2012, Joe returned to Pro Wrestling Noah as part of its &quot;Great Voyage&quot; tour. Teaming with Magnus, he defeated Special Assault Team (Akitoshi Saito and Jun Akiyama) to win the GHC Tag Team Championship in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. Joe made his final appearance with Pro Wrestling Noah several months later on October 8, when he and Magnus lost the GHC Tag Team Championship to No Mercy (Kenta and Maybach Taniguchi) in Yokohama.

===WWE (2015–2022)===
==== NXT Champion (2015–2017) ====
In 2015, Samoa Joe was signed to a non-exclusive developmental contract by WWE. On May 20, 2015, during the main event of NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable, he made what was his first appearance with WWE since February 2001, stopping Kevin Owens from attacking an injured Sami Zayn with a chair. Joe made his in-ring debut at the May 21 &quot;NXT&quot; tapings, defeating Scott Dawson in a match that aired on June 10. While initially Joe&#x27;s contact enabled him to continue working outside WWE, on June 1, WWE signed him to a full-time contract due to his impressive merchandise sales. On the same day, Joe wrestled Tyson Kidd in a &quot;WWE Superstars&quot; dark match; the match ended when Kidd suffered a legitimate career-ending spinal cord injury when Joe gave him a muscle buster. On the June 17 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, a match between Joe and Kevin Owens ended in a no contest, with the two continuing to brawl after the match until they were separated. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn in August 2015, Joe defeated Baron Corbin by technical submission. Joe then entered the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament with NXT Champion Finn Bálor as his partner, defeating the Lucha Dragons in the first round, Enzo and Cass in the quarter-finals, The Mechanics in the semi-finals, and Baron Corbin and Rhyno in the finals at NXT TakeOver: Respect in October 2015.

On the November 4, 2015 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Joe turned on Finn Bálor by attacking him after a match against Apollo Crews. In December 2015 at NXT TakeOver: London, Joe unsuccessfully challenged Bálor for the NXT Championship. Writing for the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, Kyle Johnson described Joe as &quot;leaner, focused, motivated, and completely revitalized [...] as hungry as he had been in 2003-05 when he was still making his name in Ring of Honor and TNA.&quot; After defeating Sami Zayn in a two out of three falls match to become the number one contender on the March 9 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Joe challenged Bálor once again at NXT TakeOver: Dallas in April 2016, losing after suffering a large laceration to his right cheek minutes into the match. Later that month at a NXT live event in Lowell, Massachusetts, Joe finally defeated Bálor to win the NXT Championship. In his first title defense, Joe defeated Bálor in a steel cage match in June 2016 at NXT TakeOver: The End, marking the end of their feud.

Joe then engaged in a feud with Shinsuke Nakamura, who defeated him in a title match on August 20 at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II, ending his reign at 121 days. During the match, Joe suffered a legitimate dislocated jaw. On November 19 at NXT TakeOver: Toronto, Joe defeated Nakamura in a rematch to win back the title. However, he lost the title back to Nakamura on December 3, 2016, in Osaka, Japan, ending his second reign at 14 days. Joe&#x27;s feud with Nakamura ended on December 8, 2016, in Melbourne, Australia when Nakamura successfully defended the NXT Championship against him in a steel cage match.

==== World championship pursuits (2017–2019) ====
Joe debuted on WWE&#x27;s main roster on the January 30, 2017 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, attacking Seth Rollins and aligning himself with Triple H. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, he defeated Roman Reigns after a distraction by Braun Strowman. At Fastlane in March 2017, Joe defeated Sami Zayn by technical submission. At Payback in April 2017, Joe lost to Seth Rollins; he retaliated by costing Rollins a match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on &quot;Raw&quot; the following night.

At Extreme Rules in June 2017, Joe defeated Finn Bàlor, Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and Bray Wyatt in an Extreme Rules match to become the number one contender to the WWE Universal Championship. At WWE Great Balls of Fire in July 2017, Joe unsuccessfully challenged Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship. On the July 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Joe faced Reigns to determine the next number one contender for the Universal Championship; the match ended in a no contest after Braun Strowman interfered and attacked both men. At SummerSlam in August 2017, Joe, Reigns, and Strowman all challenged Lesnar for the Universal Championship in a fatal four-way match, with Lesnar pinning Reigns to retain his title. At a house show later that month, Joe suffered a knee injury.

Joe returned from injury on the October 30, 2017 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Apollo Crews. At Survivor Series in November 2017, Joe teamed with Finn Bálor, Braun Strowman, Triple H and Kurt Angle (as &quot;Team Raw&quot;) to defeat Bobby Roode, John Cena, Randy Orton, Shane McMahon, and Shinsuke Nakamura (as &quot;Team SmackDown&quot;) in a Survivor Series match. He went on to feud with The Shield, costing Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins a Raw Tag Team Championship match against Cesaro and Sheamus and unsuccessfully challenging Roman Reigns for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. In January 2018, Joe suffered a tear to the plantar fascia in his right foot during a match with Titus O&#x27;Neil.

On the March 5, 2019 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, Joe defeated R-Truth, Rey Mysterio, and Andrade in a fatal four way match to win the WWE United States Championship. At Fastlane later that month, Joe successfully defended the title in a rematch. At WrestleMania 35 in April 2019, Joe successfully defended the title against Mysterio in a singles match lasting under one minute. At Money in the Bank in May 2019, Joe lost the title to Mysterio. On the June 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mysterio was forced to relinquish the WWE United States Championship due to a separated shoulder, and surrendered the title to Joe. At Stomping Grounds later that month, Joe lost the WWE United States Championship to Ricochet.

The night after losing the United States Championship, Joe attacked WWE Champion Kofi Kingston, leading to a title match at Extreme Rules in July 2019 that was won by Kingston. At the Smackville event later that month, Joe unsuccessfully challenged Kingston for the title in a triple threat match also involving Dolph Ziggler. In August to September 2019, Joe competed in the 2019 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Cesaro in the first round, wrestling Ricochet to a draw in the quarter-finals, and losing to Baron Corbin in the semi-finals in a triple threat match also involving Ricochet. Following the match, Joe became inactive while rehabilitating a broken thumb. While injured, Joe began appearing as a color commentator on the November 18, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (replacing Dio Maddin) as well as appearing on &quot;WWE Backstage&quot;.

On the December 23, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Joe was attacked by the Authors of Pain. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Joe saved Kevin Owens from an attack by the Authors of Pain and Seth Rollins. Joe returned to the ring in January 2020. Later that month he competed in the Royal Rumble, being eliminated by Rollins. On the February 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Joe teamed with Owens and the Viking Raiders in a loss to Rollins, the Authors of Pain, and Murphy; this was his penultimate match with WWE and his last match for 18 months. Later that month, it was reported that Joe had injured his head during a commercial shoot and was not medically cleared to compete. Four days later, Joe was suspended for 30 days for violating the WWE wellness policy.

Joe returned to television on the April 27, 2020 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, replacing Jerry Lawler as the &quot;Raw&quot; color commentator. He was named &quot;Commentator of the Year&quot; for 2020 by CBS Sports. He remained on the &quot;Raw&quot; commentary team until April 12, 2021, when he was replaced by Corey Graves. He was released by WWE on April 15, 2021.

==== Return to NXT (2021–2022) ====
In June 2021, Joe was rehired by WWE, reportedly at the behest of NXT&#x27;s head producer Triple H. Joe made his return on the June 15 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, being presented as the &quot;enforcer&quot; of NXT&#x27;s general manager William Regal. Over the next few weeks, Joe feuded with NXT Champion Karrion Kross, leading to a title match at NXT TakeOver 36 in Orlando, Florida on August 22 where Joe defeated Kross to win the NXT Championship for an unprecedented third time. This was Joe&#x27;s sole match during his 2021 to 2022 run with WWE. On September 12, 2021, Joe relinquished the NXT Championship before making any title defenses; he stated in 2022 that he vacated the title due to a combination of him testing positive for COVID-19 and WWE chairman Vince McMahon wanting to change the overall creative direction of NXT. After recovering from COVID-19, Joe was assigned to work as a trainer backstage. He was released by WWE once again on January 6, 2022, having not reappeared on television since his third reign as NXT Champion.

=== All Elite Wrestling / Return to ROH (2022–present) ===

==== Championship reigns (2022–2024) ====
Samoa Joe returned to Ring of Honor, now owned by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) co-founder and president Tony Khan, on April 1, 2022, at Supercard of Honor XV, coming to the aid of Jonathan Gresham and Lee Moriarty after they were attacked by Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt. Following this, Tony Khan announced that Joe had signed with AEW. On the April 6 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, Joe made his in-ring AEW debut, defeating Max Caster to qualify for the 2022 Owen Hart Foundation Tournament. On the following episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, Joe defeated Minoru Suzuki to win the ROH World Television Championship, becoming an ROH Triple Crown winner in the process. Joe defeated Johnny Elite in the quarter-finals and Kyle O&#x27;Reilly in the semi-finals of the Owen Hart Foundation Tournament before losing to Adam Cole in the final at Double or Nothing due to interference by Bobby Fish.

At Death Before Dishonor in July 2022, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Television Championship against Jay Lethal. Due to their common problems with Lethal, Sonjay Dutt, and Satnam Singh, Joe began teaming with AEW TNT Champion Wardlow as &quot;WarJoe&quot;. The duo defeated Josh Woods and Tony Nese at Grand Slam in September 2023. The team broke up due to Joe attacking Wardlow after Powerhouse Hobbs began eyeing Wardlow&#x27;s TNT Championship, causing Wardlow to unintentionally undermine Joe and his ROH World Television Championship turning heel. This set up a three-way match for the TNT Championship between Joe, Wardlow, and Hobbs at Full Gear in November 2022, where Joe defeated Wardlow and Hobbs to win the TNT Championship, making him a double champion. After winning both television championships, Joe began referring to himself as the &quot;King of Television&quot;. On the November 30, 2022 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Joe made his first successful TNT Championship defense against AR Fox. The following week on &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Joe defeated former TNT Champion Darby Allin in another defense. After Joe attacked Allin post-match, Wardlow ran to the ring, causing Joe to flee. At the ROH pay-per-view Final Battle in December 2022, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Television Championship against Juice Robinson. Later that month at &quot;&quot;, Joe successfully defended the TNT Championship against Wardlow, then cut off a portion of Wardlow&#x27;s hair after the match.

On the January 4, 2023 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Joe lost the TNT Championship to Allin, ending his reign at 46 days. On the February 1 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Joe regained the title after defeating Allin in a no holds barred match. After the match, he was attacked by a returning Wardlow. Wardlow subsequently defeated Joe to win the TNT Championship at Revolution in March 2023.

Throughout mid-2023, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Television Championship against challengers such as Mark Briscoe, Colt Cabana, Blake Christian, Matt Sydal, and Dalton Castle. In June 2023, he entered the 2023 Owen Hart Foundation Tournament, but was eliminated by CM Punk in the semi-finals the following month.

At All In in August 2023, Joe unsuccessfully challenged CM Punk for the &quot;Real World Championship&quot;. The following month at All Out, Joe successfully defended the ROH World Television Championship against Shane Taylor; on his way to the ring, Joe jostled AEW World Champion MJF, leading to a brawl. Subsequently, Joe entered the Grand Slam World Championship Eliminator Tournament, defeating Jeff Hardy in the quarter-finals; Penta El Zero Miedo in the semi-finals; and Roderick Strong in the final; at Grand Slam on September 20, he unsuccessfully challenged MJF for the AEW World Championship. On November 2, Joe became the longest-reigning ROH World Television Champion in history at 574 days.
n November 10, 2023, Joe vacated the ROH World Television Championship in order to focus on challenging for the AEW World Championship. At Full Gear later that month, Joe (substituting for the injured Adam Cole) teamed with MJF to successfully defend the ROH World Tag Team Championship against the Gunns. In return for teaming with MJF, Joe was granted a second shot at the AEW World Championship at Worlds End in the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York in December 2023. The match saw Joe cleanly defeat MJF by technical submission using the Coquina Clutch to win the AEW World Championship. He defeated Hook in his first title defense in January 2024. At Revolution in March 2024, Joe successfully defended his title against &quot;Hangman&quot; Adam Page and Swerve Strickland in a three-way match, submitting Page using the Coquina Clutch. Joe went on to successfully defend his title against Wardlow at AEW Big Business. At AEW Dynasty in April 2024, Joe lost the title to Strickland, ending his reign at 113 days.

==== The Opps (2024–present) ====

Following his loss to Strickland, Joe formed a tag team with Hook. After a short feud with the Premier Athletes, Joe, Hook, and Katsuyori Shibata defeated Chris Jericho&#x27;s Learning Tree stable in a trios match at Forbidden Door in June 2024. In July 2024, Joe was removed from the Scotiabank Saddledome in an ambulance after losing a &quot;Stampede Street Fight&quot; to Jericho when Jericho drove him through a wall using a forklift; the angle was used to explain Joe going on hiatus to film season two of &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;. He returned in January 2025 at AEW Maximum Carnage, saving Hook from an attack by The Patriarchy. In February 2025, the trio of Joe, Hook, and Shibata were named &quot;The Opps.&quot;

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Samoa Joe wrestles in a &quot;technician&quot; and &quot;powerhouse&quot; style, with &quot;blistering, MMA-inspired offense&quot;. Ring of Honor described him as &quot;one of the hardest-hitting and most intense competitors in the sport&quot;. His signature moves include the &quot;Coquina Clutch&quot; (a rear naked choke), the &quot;Coquina Plex&quot; (a sleeper suplex), the facewash, the &quot;Island Driver&quot; (a sitout side powerslam), the muscle buster, the &quot;Olé Kick&quot; (a Yakuza kick), the STF, the &quot;STJoe&quot; (an STO), and the uranage. Joe is also known for a maneuver colloquially dubbed the &quot;nope spot&quot;, which sees him casually walk out of the way of an opponent executing an aerial maneuver.

Joe&#x27;s ring attire typically comprises shorts colored black and gold, green, or red, along with black knee pads, athletic tape on his left fist, and a towel draped around his neck.

Joe&#x27;s use of submission holds saw him nicknamed the &quot;Samoan Submission Machine&quot;. In 2022, after winning the AEW TNT Championship and ROH World Television Championship, Joe began referring to himself as the &quot;King of Television&quot;.

== Other media ==
In 2006, Joe made brief appearances on the American version of the television show &quot;Distraction&quot;, participating in a round where wrestlers performed moves on contestants while they answered questions. In June 2022, Joe was announced as doing the physical performance of the character Sweet Tooth for Peacock&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; (the character was voiced by Will Arnett). Joe has voiced characters in the animated web series &quot;&quot; and video games including &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Dota Underlords&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, &quot;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&quot; and &quot;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.&quot;

In April 2014, Joe launched a video game streaming channel on Twitch. He has appeared on Rob Van Dam&#x27;s web-based reality show &quot;RVD TV&quot; numerous times. In 2023, Joe appeared on the &quot;Doughboys&quot; podcast, reviewing Taco Bell.

<doc id="994161" wikidata="Q6982450" url="?curid=994161" title="Navigator Badge">
<text>The Navigator Badge is a military qualification badge of the United States Air Force which was first created during the Second World War. The current USAF badge is designated by Air Force Instructions as the Navigator/Observer Badge and is issued to rated officers in both rating categories. In 2009, it was renamed as the Combat Systems Officer badge.

The badge recognizes the Aeronautical Rating of Navigator, now Combat Systems Officer. The original Navigator badge was a successor to the Observer Badge, which was issued to military aviation navigators in the 1920s and 1930s. With an increase in aircraft technology, however, the Navigator, Bombardier, Engineer, and Gunner badges were created to recognize the advanced training and qualifications required of various aircrew members.

The original Navigator badge was issued by the U.S. Army Air Forces and consisted of an armillary sphere centered between two wings. The badge was similar to the Aviator Badge and the Aircrew Badge. On July 26, 1947, the U.S. Air Force became a separate Branch of Service in the U.S. armed forces. and in late 1951 the Aircraft Observer, Navigator, and Bombardier badges were replaced with a single design, with the Air Force shield centered between two wings. At the same time, the aeronautical ratings of Navigator and Bombardier were merged into a single rating. The Aircraft Observer rating continued for Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs), but eventually EWOs were awarded the Navigator-Bombardier aeronautical rating.

The current USAF Navigator/Combat Systems Officer/Observer Badge is issued in three degrees: Basic, Senior, and Master. The degree of the Navigator/Combat Systems Officer/Observer Badge is determined by years of flying service in the Air Force and by logged hours of flight time or flying duty assignment time. The degrees are annotated by a star alone (senior) and a star and wreath (master) centered above the badge.

There is also an astronaut version of the badge for those who have flown the NASA Space Shuttle and/or served on the International Space Station. Like its pilot astronaut counterpart, the Navigator/Observer Astronaut Badge is modified by the addition of the astronaut &quot;shooting star&quot; logo over the USAF shield on the wings. Navigator Astronauts or Combat Systems Officer Astronauts are those officers who have previously flown USAF aircraft as aeronautically rated Navigators / Combat Systems Officers and subsequently qualify as astronauts. A third variant of this same insignia is the Observer Astronaut. Today, the only personnel awarded the Observer rating are otherwise unrated U.S. Air Force officers who complete NASA Mission Specialist (astronaut) training and subsequently fly in space.

For Navy and Marine Corps officers, the equivalent of the Navigator Badge / Combat Systems Officer badge is known as the Naval Flight Officer insignia and is similar to the Naval Aviator insignia for pilots, being differentiated by two crossed fouled anchors behind the insignia&#x27;s United States shield, versus the single upright fouled anchor of their USN, USMC and USCG pilot counterparts. The Coast Guard briefly had Naval Flight Officers when they operated E-2 Hawkeye aircraft bailed from the Navy. There is also an astronaut version of the badge for those who have flown the NASA Space Shuttle and/or served on the International Space Station. Like its Naval Aviator Astronaut counterpart, the Naval Flight Officer Astronaut Badge is modified by the addition of the astronaut &quot;shooting star&quot; logo over the US shield on the wings.

The Marine Corps also issues the Marine Aerial Navigator insignia to enlisted personnel trained as navigators for the KC-130. Unlike their USAF counterpart, the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard aviation insignia have no basic, senior or master/command degrees. The Army has no equivalent to the Navigator Badge.

===Combat System Officer ratings===

The Combat System Officer (CSO) awarded by the Commander or delegated wing commanders. Under a program that began in the fall of 2004 to replace the &quot;Joint Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training&quot; course, portions of the previous navigator and electronic warfare officer training courses were combined into a curriculum with the objective of developing an aviator with cross-flow capability between the two positions on combat aircraft. The curriculum includes a wider range of topics, with an increased emphasis on warfighting, to develop leadership, decision-making and mission management skills. Navigators and CSOs wear identical badges. rating is awarded to individuals who entered the CSO Undergraduate Flying Training after 1 October 2004. The USAF awards combat system officer ratings at three levels: &quot;Combat System Officer&quot;, &quot;Senior Combat System Officer&quot;, and &quot;Master Combat System Officer&quot;, for active duty officers and officers considered rated assets in the Air Reserve Components. The insignia is identical to USAF Navigator, but rated navigators who are not CSO rated are not eligible for award of advanced CSO ratings. The following additional criteria are required for rating as a USAF Combat System Officer:

===Navigator ratings===
The USAF awards navigator ratings at three levels: &quot;Navigator&quot;, &quot;Senior Navigator&quot;, and &quot;Master Navigator&quot;, for active duty officers and officers considered &quot;rated assets&quot; in the Air Reserve Components. After 2009 only Combat System Operators receive ratings formerly awarded to navigators, as the occupational field is being phased out. The following additional criteria are required for rating as a USAF Navigator:
===Observer ratings===

The USAF awards observer ratings at three levels: &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Senior Observer&quot;, and &quot;Master Observer&quot;, for active duty officers and officers considered &quot;rated assets&quot; in the Air Reserve Components. The insignia is identical to USAF Navigator/CSO and is typically only awarded as an &quot;observer&quot; insignia with the Astronaut emblem to USAF officers who have completed training as NASA Mission Specialist Astronauts, have flown at least once in space in the Space Shuttle and/or served at the International Space Station, and are not otherwise rated as USAF Pilots or USAF Navigators/CSOs. The following additional criteria are required to be rated as a USAF Observer:

<text>William Walter Boyd (January 27, 1906 – November 21, 1997) was a professional poker player.

Boyd was a five-card stud player; he won all four of his World Series of Poker bracelets in five-card stud. Boyd, Doyle Brunson and Loren Klein are the only players in WSOP history to have won bracelets in four consecutive years.

Additionally, Boyd is responsible for the spread of Omaha hold &#x27;em. In 1983, Robert &quot;Chip Burner&quot; Turner approached Boyd, who was then the director of operations at the Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The game, being previously unnamed, was called &quot;Nugget hold &#x27;em&quot;. Sometime later, it was renamed to its current name of &quot;Omaha&quot;.

Boyd managed the card room at the Golden Nugget from the day it opened in 1946 until its closing in 1988.

As a tribute to his long career, he was dealt the first poker hand ever at the Mirage. He was elected to the Poker Hall of Fame in 1981.

Boyd died in Las Vegas on November 21, 1997, at the age of 91.

<doc id="994170" wikidata="Q471879" url="?curid=994170" title="Joss Ackland">
<text>Sidney Edmond Jocelyn Ackland (29 February 1928 – 19 November 2023) was an English actor who appeared in more than 130 film, radio and television roles. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for portraying Jock Delves Broughton in &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987).

==Early life==
Sidney Edmond Jocelyn Ackland was born in a basement flat in &quot;then insalubrious&quot; North Kensington, London, on 29 February 1928, the son of Sydney Norman Ackland (died 1981), an Irish journalist who had been sent to England to live with an aunt by his parents for seducing their maid, but subsequently seduced his aunt&#x27;s maid, Ruth Izod (died 1957), whom he married. The Acklands&#x27; basement flat was one of &quot;a string of similar places&quot; in which they lived, invariably with &quot;one bedroom and the absolute bare essentials&quot;; Ackland described his upbringing in the Ladbroke Grove area as being &quot;very poor&quot;.

Ackland was trained by Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

Ackland and Rosemary Kirkcaldy were married on 18 August 1951, when Ackland was 23 and she was 22. She was an actress and Ackland wooed her when they appeared on stage together in Pitlochry, Scotland. The couple struggled initially as Ackland&#x27;s acting career was in its infancy. In 1954 they moved to Lilongwe in what was then Nyasaland, now Malawi, where Ackland managed a tea plantation for six months but, deciding it was too dangerous, they moved to Cape Town, South Africa. Though they both obtained steady acting jobs in South Africa, after two years they returned to England in 1957.

==Career==
After attending London&#x27;s Central School of Speech and Drama, he made his professional debut on stage at just 17 years old, starring in the 1945 production of The Hasty Heart. Ackland joined the Old Vic, appearing alongside other notable actors including Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Tom Courtenay. Ackland worked steadily in television and film in the 1960s and 70s. 

He worked opposite Alec Guinness in the 1979 television serial &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, playing sporting journalist and intermittent British espionage operative Jerry Westerby, and his career advanced through the 1980s with important parts in such films as &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;White Mischief&quot;.
On television Ackland appeared as Jephro Rucastle with Jeremy Brett and David Burke in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes;&quot; the episode entitled &quot;The Copper Beeches&quot;. Other appearances included &quot;Passion of Mind&quot; with Demi Moore and the two-part TV serial &quot;Hogfather&quot; based on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot;. He played C. S. Lewis in the television version of &quot;Shadowlands&quot; before it was adapted into a stage play starring Nigel Hawthorne and then a theatrical film with Anthony Hopkins in the same role. His voice (as well as that of Roy Dotrice) was heard reading quotations in several episodes of Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s 1973 documentary series &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;.

His voice was also a mainstay of many British television commercials including Yellow Pages, WK Kellogg Co and Homepride.

Ackland&#x27;s stage roles included creating the role of Juan Perón in Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Evita&quot; opposite Elaine Paige. He also starred in the London production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s and Hugh Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; with Jean Simmons and Hermione Gingold, performing on the RCA Victor original London cast album.

Ackland appeared in the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; 1988 film &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, and in the video for their version of the song &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, which was taken from the film. Several years later, he said in an interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot; that he had appeared with the band purely because his grandchildren liked their music.

Ackland also co-starred as Emilio Estevez&#x27;s mentor and friend Hans in the 1992 Disney &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. He reprised the role four years later in 1996&#x27;s &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot;.

In a 2001 interview with the BBC, Ackland said that he had appeared in some &quot;awful&quot; films due to being a workaholic. He said that he &quot;regretted&quot; appearing in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; and the Pet Shop Boys music video. He also criticised former co-star Demi Moore as &quot;not very bright or talented&quot;, though he worked with her again years later in &quot;Flawless&quot; (2008).

Also in 2007, Ackland appeared in the film &quot;How About You&quot; opposite Vanessa Redgrave, portraying a recovering alcoholic living in a residential home after being forced to retire and losing his wife to cancer.

In 2008, Ackland returned to the small screen as Sir Freddy Butler, a much married baronet, in the ITV1 show &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. The episode was entitled &quot;Vixens Run&quot;.

In September 2013, Jonathan Miller directed a Gala Performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Old Vic in London, with Ackland in the role of Lear.

==Personal life and death==
Ackland and his wife Rosemary (née Kirkcaldy) were married for 51 years. They had seven children, thirty-two grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Despite his filming taking him to far-flung locations, he said Rosemary and he &quot;were hardly ever apart&quot;. Daughter Kirsty married Anthony Shawn Baring, a descendant of the merchant banker Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet and a descendant of Robert Rundell Guinness, founder of the merchant bank Guinness Mahon. 

In 1963, their house in Barnes caught fire. Rosemary saved their five children but broke her back when jumping from the bedroom window. She was told she would miscarry and never walk again, but she later gave birth and after 18 months in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, was able to walk again. Their eldest son, Paul, died of a heroin overdose in 1982, aged 29. In 2000, Rosemary was diagnosed with motor neurone disease; she died on 25 July 2002. 

In 2020, Ackland participated in the &quot;Letters Live&quot; project, and was recorded from his home in Clovelly, Devon. His letter reflected on the COVID-19 crisis and his hopes for how the country could draw &quot;strength from adversity&quot;.

<text>James F. Coleman is an American musician who plays keyboards and sampler. He was a member of the 1990s noise rock band Cop Shoot Cop, and afterwards worked as a solo musician specializing in instrumental electronic music and film scores.

==Biography==
He was a founding member of New York&#x27;s Cop Shoot Cop, and performed under a variety of stage names: Cripple Jim (he toured on crutches due to a broken leg), and usually as Filer. For most of their existence the band had two bassists and no guitar, leaving Coleman&#x27;s keyboards to occupy much of the middle-frequency range normally filled by a guitarist in a rock band. Coleman&#x27;s use of found sounds and other unusual noises was described as &quot;inventive&quot; by critics Art Black David Sprague of Trouser Press. On &quot;Release&quot; (1994), Cop Shoot Cop&#x27;s final album, Coleman relied more on conventional piano playing rather than his early sample-based approach.

He has recorded solo albums as Phylr and the closely related project Here (with Teho Teardo) and collaborates with JG Thirlwell as Baby Zizanie.

Most recently, Coleman has released the ambient album &quot;Trees&quot; (2012) under his own name. He has been doing sporadic live shows of this material in Europe and the US.

Additionally, Coleman has scored a good number of indie films and TV series. Indie features emerging in 2014 are &quot;Exposed&quot; by Beth B and &quot;Stay Then Go&quot; by Shelli Ainsworth. He has worked with directors such as Todd Phillips, Hal Hartley, Richard Kern and Danny Leitner.

Coleman is currently working on a number of music tracks that are based on recordings of people&#x27;s near death experiences.

In 2018-2019, Coleman co-formed a new group called Human Impact.

<text>Karur () is a municipal corporation in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the administrative headquarters of Karur district and is administered by the Karur Municipal Corporation. It is located on the banks of the rivers Amaravathi, Kaveri and Noyyal. It is situated at about southwest of the state capital Chennai.

The region was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period and the town might have been part of the Chera capital at Vanchi-Karuvoor. It formed a part of the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Archeological evidence points to Karur being a centre of trade during the Chera period. The region was ruled later by the Cholas, as evident from temple epigraphs. It was under the control of Pandyas, Vijayanagara Empire and the Madurai Nayaks across various periods in history. In the later part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company annexed it to the Madras Presidency in 1799. After Indian Independence in 1947, it became pert of Madras State, the predecessor of Tamil Nadu.

The economy of the town is dependent on agriculture and textiles. Hindus form the majority of the urban population, with a minor population of Muslims and Christians. Tamil is the major spoken and official language. Karur is a part of the Karur Assembly constituency that elects a member to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly once every five years.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Karur&quot; came from &quot;Karuvur&quot;, the Chera capital of the same name. In Tamil, the name literally means &#x27;&quot;embryo town&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Karu&quot; meaning &quot;embryo&quot; and &quot;Oor&quot; meaning &quot;town&quot; or &quot;place&quot;). It is probably derived from the Hindu mythology linked with the creator God Brahma and was earlier referred to as Brahmapuri. In vernacular parlance, the town was referred by names such as Tiruvanilai and Pasupati.

== History ==
Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of the Sangam period (3rd century BC to 3rd century CE), ruled over the region with their capital at Vanchi-Karuvoor. Historians are divided on the exact location of the Chera capital and have opined that it might correspond to either the present day Karur in Tamil Nadu or Kodungalur in Kerala. Karur, which was known as Karuvur, was part of the Kongu Nadu region in the ancient Tamilakam and was one of the oldest inhabited towns in the state. Archaeological excavations from Kodumanal, further along the Noyyal River from Karur, show traces of civilization from 4th century BCE.

Archeological evidence points to Karur being a centre of trade during the Chera period. The Tamil epic &quot;Silapathikaram&quot; mentions that the Chera king Senguttuvan ruling from Karuvur. The archaeological excavations undertaken in Karur have yielded pottery, bricks, mud-toys, Roman Amphorae, Rasset coated ware, rings and coins belonging to various eras. Karur might have been the center for old jewellery-making and gem setting, as seen from various excavations. In 150 CE, Greek scholar Ptolemy mentioned &quot;Korevora&quot; as an inland trading center in South India. The region was part of an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris in the west coast to Arikamedu along the east coast of India. Early Tamil Brahmi writings have been found on coins, seals and rings obtained from Amaravati River bed near Karur.

The region came under the influence of the Pandyas during the reign of Arikesari Maravarman in the seventh century CE. Later, the region was ruled by various dynasties such as Rashtrakutas and Western Gangas. The Cholas led by Aditya I, conquered the region in ninth century CE. While the region was directly under the control of the Imperial Cholas till 1064 CE, the Kongu Cholas who were probably vassals or viceroys of the Cholas, ruled the region autonomously later. Temple inscriptions found near Karur dated to the period of Kulothunga Chola I mention the location as &quot;Vanchimanagarama Karuvur&quot; (Vanchi city of Karuvur). 

It was later ruled by the Vijayanagara Empire and the Madurai Nayaks, who were vassals of Vijayanagara earlier. In the latter part of the 17th century, the region came under the influence of the Kingdom of Mysore. In the later part of the 18th century, the place changed hands multiple times between the Mysore Kingdom and the British East India Company. In 1790, the British captured it for the third time and the Karur fort remained as a British garrison until 1801.

Under the British Raj, the region was annexed to the Madras Presidency and served as the headquarters of the sub-collector. The Karur municipality was constituted in 1874. After Indian Independence in 1947, the region was part of the Madras State. After the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which re-organized state boundaries, majority of the region became part of the new Madras state, which would become Tamil Nadu in 1969.

<doc id="994174" wikidata="Q842156" url="?curid=994174" title="Lagwagon">
<text>Lagwagon is an American punk rock band originally from Goleta, California, just outside Santa Barbara. They formed in 1989, went on hiatus in 2000, and reunited several times over the years. Their name comes from the band&#x27;s tour van, which can be seen on the back cover of their 1994 second album &quot;Trashed&quot;.

The band has 12 releases through Fat Wreck Chords: nine studio albums, one EP, one live album and a collection of B-sides, compilation tracks and demos. Lagwagon has never had, nor have they seemed to pursue, strong mainstream success, but they do have a devoted underground following in North America, Europe and Asia. Their moderate success reflected a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands Rancid, Green Day and The Offspring. Their song &quot;May 16&quot; was also featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;.

== History ==

Lagwagon originally started under the name Section 8 but were dissatisfied with the name because multiple other bands were already using it. According to the liner notes of the re-release of &quot;Duh&quot;, it was Fat Mike&#x27;s idea to switch to Lagwagon based on the already written song of the same name about the band&#x27;s unreliable touring van. After signing to Fat Mike&#x27;s label Fat Wreck Chords, Lagwagon released their debut album for the label, &quot;Duh&quot;, in 1992. Frontman Joey Cape commented on how the album was made, &quot;Back then, we were inexperienced in the studio. It was less about the recording process and more about rehearsing. We recorded and mixed &quot;Duh&quot; in 4 days. There&#x27;s something to be said for a budget. You have to have your shit together before you go into the studio and the end result is a record that better reflects the band&#x27;s sound at the time.&quot; Two years later, Lagwagon released &quot;Trashed&quot;, their second record on Fat, which turned out to be highly successful, leading to the eventual production of a video for &quot;Island of Shame.&quot; During this time, a number of punk bands, such as Green Day, The Offspring and Rancid, had hit the mainstream and Lagwagon turned down offers to join several major labels. &quot;Hoss&quot;, the third Lagwagon album, was released on November 21, 1995. After the release of that album and an extensive tour in Europe, Australia, and Japan, both guitarist Shawn Dewey and drummer Derrick Plourde would leave the band and be replaced temporarily by Kenneth Stringfellow (The Posies) on guitar, and permanently by Dave Raun (RKL) on drums. Shawn Dewey, already in the side project band Buck Wild on Lobster Records would go on to release two full-length LPs, &quot;Beat Me Silly&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Overdrive&quot;, and do two European tours with Good Riddance and Ten Foot Pole.

After two more albums, &quot;Double Plaidinum&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Feelings&quot;, the band went on indefinite hiatus in 2000, due to all members working on side projects. Lagwagon resurfaced in 2002, and released their sixth album &quot;Blaze&quot; the following year. In 2004, frontman Joey Cape released a split album with No Use for a Name vocalist Tony Sly featuring acoustic versions of songs by both bands. On November 1, 2005, Lagwagon released &quot;Resolve&quot;, which is a homage to the life of Derrick Plourde, original drummer for Lagwagon and Bad Astronaut.

In 2008, Lagwagon released an EP titled &quot;I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen to Lagwagon&quot;. Despite earlier reports that the band would begin recording their next full-length studio album by 2009, Lagwagon had gone on hiatus from touring and writing again, due to Cape launching a solo career, releasing &quot;Bridge&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Play Well with Others&quot; in 2010.

In January 2010, Joey Cape announced during an interview with Canada&#x27;s &quot;Exclaim!&quot; magazine that Jesse Buglione had left Lagwagon, having been with the band since its foundation in 1990. However, Cape dismissed rumors of Lagwagon breaking up. While he was not sure if Lagwagon would record a new album or embark on another full-scale tour, he said that he was open to playing shows and possibly recording and releasing new Lagwagon songs sporadically. Jesse Buglione confirmed his departure on Lagwagon&#x27;s official message board himself, as reported by sputnikmusic.com and punknews.org. Lagwagon toured with No Use for a Name that summer. In an interview with fasterlouder.com.au Joey Cape, revealed former RKL bassist Joe Raposo is Lagwagon&#x27;s new bassist. In a June 2011 interview with ExploreMusic however, Joey Cape said that things didn&#x27;t work out with Raposo, and the band is testing a new bassist. After first announcing Patrick Solem as the new bass player in August 2011, the band decided that Raposo would remain in the band permanently.

On September 22, 2011, Fat Wreck announced they would be re-issuing expanded editions of the first five albums on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The albums were available both separately and in a box set titled &quot;Putting Music In Its Place&quot;. The reissues were released November 22, 2011, with a short line-up of concerts in the U.S. played in December and January, and a European tour following in April 2012. Lagwagon headlined a full U.S. tour titled The Fat Tour 2012, with Dead To Me, The Flatliners, and Useless ID as support.

In October 2012, Joey Cape stated that there will be a new Lagwagon album, which will be their first since 2005&#x27;s &quot;Resolve&quot;. While details and release dates are not yet known, the band announced on its Twitter feed that songs are being written for a new album. The September 22 Tweet reads, &quot;Writing, writing, writing. New album... It&#x27;s gonna happen!&quot; 

The band recorded their eighth album, &quot;Hang&quot;, with Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at The Blasting Room, Ft Collins, CO. The album was released on October 28, 2014, and debuted at #95 on the Billboard 200.

On October 4, 2019, the band released their ninth studio album &quot;Railer&quot;, with the lead single being &quot;Bubble&quot;. To support the new release, a tour was announced with Face to Face as a co-headlining event.

<doc id="994177" wikidata="Q266816" url="?curid=994177" title="José María Arguedas">
<text>José María Arguedas Altamirano (18 January 1911 – 2 December 1969) was a Peruvian novelist, poet, and anthropologist. Arguedas was an author of mestizo descent who was fluent in the Quechua language. That fluency was gained by Arguedas’s living in two Quechua households from the age of 7 to 11. First, he lived in the Indigenous servant quarters of his stepmother&#x27;s home, then, escaping her &quot;perverse and cruel&quot; son, with an Indigenous family approved by his father. Arguedas wrote novels, short stories, and poems in both Spanish and Quechua.

Generally regarded as one of the most notable figures of 20th-century Peruvian literature, Arguedas is especially recognized for his intimate portrayals of Indigenous Andean culture. Key in his desire to depict Indigenous expression and perspective more authentically was his creation of a new idiom that blended Spanish and Quechua and premiered in his debut novel &quot;Yawar Fiesta&quot;.

Notwithstanding a dearth of translations into English, the critic Martin Seymour-Smith has dubbed Arguedas &quot;the greatest novelist of our time,&quot; who wrote &quot;some of the most powerful prose that the world has known.&quot;

==Biography==

José Maria Arguedas was born on 18 January 1911 in Andahuaylas, a province in the southern Peruvian Andes. He was born into a well-off family, but his mother died when he was two years old. Because of the absence of his father, a lawyer who traveled frequently, and his bad relationship with his step-mother and step-brother, he comforted himself in the care of the family&#x27;s Indigenous servants, allowing him to immerse himself in the language and customs of the Andes, which came to form an important part of his personality. He went to primary school in San Juan de Lucana, Puquio, and Abancay, and completed his secondary studies in Ica, Huancayo, and Lima.

He began studying at National University of San Marcos (Lima) in 1931; there he graduated with a degree in literature. He later took up studies in Ethnology, receiving his degree in 1957 and his doctorate in 1963. Between 1937 and 1938 he was sent to El Sexto Prison for protesting an envoy sent to Peru by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

Arguedas also worked for the Ministry of Education, where he put into practice his interests in preserving and promoting Peruvian culture, in particular traditional Andean music and dance. He was the director of the Casa de la Cultura (1963) and of the National Museum of History (1964–1966).

In 1968, Arguedas was awarded the &quot;Inca Garcilaso de la Vega&quot; literary prize, where he gave his famous speech &quot;No soy un aculturado&quot; (I am not an acculturated man), which has been described by academic sources as a &quot;powerful&quot; embracing of his mixed heritage.

Arguedas&#x27; depression became a crisis in 1966, leading him to a first suicide attempt by overdose on April 11 of that year. After the suicide attempt, his life dramatically changed. To treat his illness, he contacted the Chilean psychiatrist Lola Hoffman, who recommended, as a treatment, that he continue writing. Following her instructions, he published another book of short stories &quot;Amor Mundo&quot; and worked on what would be his posthumous work: &quot;The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below.&quot;

On November 29, 1969, Arguedas locked himself in one of the university bathrooms and shot himself at the National Agrarian University in La Molina, leaving behind very specific instructions for his funeral, a diary depicting his depression, and the final unfinished manuscript of &quot;The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below&quot;.

This work includes portions of Arguedas&#x27;s diary, memories of his distressing childhood, thoughts on Peruvian culture, and his reasons for suicide. He depicts his struggle between his desire to authentically illuminate the life of the Andean Indians and his personal anguish trapping him in depression:

The title of the book originates in a Quechua myth that Arguedas translated into Spanish earlier in his life. “El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo” refers to the Quechua symbols for life and death, and modernity and tradition.

==Literary career==
Arguedas began his literary career by writing short stories about the Indigenous environment familiar to him from his childhood. He wrote in a Spanish highly influenced by Quechua syntax and vocabulary.

By the time he published his first novel in 1941, &quot;Yawar Fiesta&quot; (&quot;Blood Fest&quot;), he had begun to explore the theme that would interest him for the rest of his career: the clash between Western &quot;civilization&quot; and the Indigenous &quot;traditional&quot; way of life. He was thus considered part of the indigenista movement in South American literature, and continued to explore this theme in his next two books &quot;Los ríos profundos&quot; (&quot;Deep Rivers,&quot; 1958) and &quot;Todas las Sangres&quot; (&quot;All the Bloods,&quot; 1964). Yet he also was conscious of the simplistic portrayal of the Indigenous peoples in other &quot;indigenista&quot; literature and worked hard to give the Andean Indians a true voice in his works. This effort was not always successful as some critics contend that Arguedas portrayed Indian characters as too gentle and childlike. Another theme in Arguedas&#x27; writing is the struggle of mestizos of Indian-Spanish descent and their navigation between the two seemingly separate parts of their identity. Many of his works also depicted the violence and exploitation of race relations in Peru&#x27;s small rural towns and haciendas.

Arguedas was moderately optimistic about the possibility of a rapprochement between the forces of &quot;tradition&quot; and the forces of &quot;modernity&quot; until the 1960s when he became more pessimistic. In his last (unfinished) work, &quot;El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo&quot; (&quot;The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below,&quot; 1969), he abandoned the realism of his earlier works for a more postmodern approach. This novel expressed his despair, caused by his fear that the &quot;primitive&quot; ways of the Indians could not survive the onslaught of modern technology and capitalism. At the same time that Arguedas was becoming more pessimistic about race relations in his country, younger Peruvian intellectuals became increasingly militant, often criticizing his work in harsh terms for his poetic, romanticized treatment of Indigenous and rural life. An instance of the debate that ensued can be seen in the famous &quot;Mesa redonda sobre Todas las Sangres&quot; (Roundtable on All the Bloods) of 1965, in which Arguedas&#x27;s penultimate novel was the object of blunt criticism from several social scientists at the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos.

=== Centenary of His Birth ===
In 2011, on the occasion of the centenary of José María Arguedas&#x27;s birth, various activities were planned in honor of the indigenist novelist. The first of these was the proposal for the Government of Peru to declare 2011 as the &quot;Year of the Centenary of the Birth of José María Arguedas&quot;. However, this was set aside, and on December 31, 2010, President Alan García declared 2011 as the &quot;Year of the Centenary of Machu Picchu for the World,&quot; also commemorating the centenary of the rediscovery of the Inca citadel in 2011. This decision sparked controversy, as many believed it was unfair not to dedicate the year to one of Peru&#x27;s greatest scholars.

On his centenary, January 18, 2011, various activities were held in his honor. In Lima, a parade organized by the Catholic University Theater (TUC) started from the Congress of the Republic, down Abancay Avenue, to the Parque Universitario, featuring floats, stilt walkers, and typical characters from Arguedas&#x27;s literature. An artistic performance followed, incorporating texts, testimonies, poems, excerpts from his works, and figures like the &quot;Zorro de Arriba&quot; and the &quot;Zorro de Abajo&quot;, using masks and a large cast of actors. The event continued at the historic Casona of the National University of San Marcos, where the Minister of Culture inaugurated the exhibition &quot;Arguedas and Popular Art&quot;.

In Andahuaylas, Apurímac, more than 5,000 people paraded through the city from seven in the morning, accompanied by folk dances and the scissors dance. The celebration began with a Quechua mass at 7:00 a.m. in the Church of San Pedro, followed by the ringing of bells.

In Bermillo de Sayago—the town that served as a study site for his doctoral thesis &quot;The Communities of Spain and Peru&quot;—a tribute was held under the slogan &quot;Peru in the &#x27;Sayaguese Soul&#x27;, Bermillo de Sayago, 1958, in the Light of Arguedas&quot;.

=== Banknote ===
In July 2022, a new 20 sol banknote featuring a photograph of José María Arguedas taken by artist Baldomero Pestana was issued. The issuance was controversial because the BCRP did not seek permission from the photographer to use the image.

<doc id="994183" wikidata="Q7934413" url="?curid=994183" title="Virginia Minstrels">
<text>The Virginia Minstrels or Virginia Serenaders was a group of 19th-century American entertainers who helped invent the entertainment form known as the minstrel show. Led by Dan Emmett, the original lineup consisted of Emmett, Billy Whitlock, Dick Pelham, and Frank Brower.

After a successful try-out in the billiard parlor of the Branch Hotel on New York City&#x27;s Bowery, the group is said to have premiered to a paying audience nearby at the Chatham Theatre, probably on January 31, 1843. They followed with a brief run at the Bowery Amphitheater in early February before an expanded schedule of venues.

== Early beginnings ==
Dan Emmett and Frank Brower both toured with The Cincinnati Circus Company during the spring of 1841. It was there that their friendship first began. Dan learned to play the banjo, and Frank accompanied him in the new song &quot;Old Tar River.&quot; In early November 1841, the playbills announced Dan Emmett as a performer.

Dan and Frank then turned to New York City. As they were already quite respected, it did not take long for them to gain fame in New York. They began performing at the Chatham Theatre with a third performer named Pierce. It is assumed that Frank and Pierce danced to Dan&#x27;s banjo accompaniment, which sometimes included vocal lines from one of the performers who wasn&#x27;t dancing.

Frank briefly left the group in the middle of December 1842. Emmett and Pierce continued to perform and were billed as &quot;the renowned Minstrel and his Little Darkey Ariel.&quot; A few weeks later, Dan Emmett and Frank Brower teamed up with Bill Whitlock and Dick Pelham, who were also popular blackface comedians. Bill Whitlock describes their formation as a happy accident, as Dan Emmett and Bill Whitlock were practicing together, and Frank Brower and Dick Pelham happened to come by and visit, joining in the practice session. After practicing for a while, they took their instruments down to the Branch Hotel and performed for the first time as the Virginia Minstrels.

== Troupe members ==
Dan Emmett - founding member and Bones (instrument) player, as well as banjo. Most famous for writing the song Dixie.

Frank Brower - toured with Dan in the circus, and would commonly accompany him in acts. Mainly a banjo player.

Billy Whitlock - would typically practice fiddle with Dan before he started the troupe. Was a large success in New York before the start of the troupe.

Dick Pelham - most established dancer out of the troupe. Played several instruments as well.

== Changes to the minstrel show ==
The main difference between the Virginia Minstrels and earlier minstrel shows was the type of performance the audience experienced. Their marketing and presentation on stage resembled that of the Hutchinson Family Singers, a group earning at least ten times the performance fees paid to minstrel troupes. While the Virginia Minstrels weren&#x27;t the first blackface performers to band together and present a show, they were the first to present a concert.

== Critical reception ==
The change of perception from being a variety show to being a concert afforded the Virginia Minstrels with patrons of a slightly upper class. Their work was deemed as refined and a breath of fresh air in the New York scene.

One critic wrote: 
&quot;Chaste, Pleasing and Elegant!&quot; - &quot;The Virginia Minstrels, who have been giving their novel and refined concerts at the Temple in Boston, and have been so liberally patronized by the elite of that city, beg most respectfully to announce to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Worcester, that they intend giving their last concert at Brinley Hall, on Wednesday eve&#x27;g, Mar. 22&quot;

The editorial that accompanied this notice stated &quot;The harmony and skill with which the banjo, violin, castinets, and tambourine are blended by these truly original minstrels, in their Ethiopian characters, is a redeeming feature to this species of amusement, and cannot fail of making it acceptable to the most refined and sensitive audience.&quot;

== Significant works ==
Unlike earlier blackface acts that featured solo singers or dancers, the Virginia Minstrels appeared as a group in blackface and what would become iconic costumes and performed more elaborate shows. In March 1843 they appeared in Welch&#x27;s Olympic Circus as part of an equestrian act. Although they primarily appeared within a larger schedule of entertainment in their earliest months, they surely were the first minstrels to also be hired to perform by themselves at smaller venues.
Among other things, they are credited with the songs &quot;Jimmy Crack Corn&quot; and &quot;Old Dan Tucker&quot;, which passed into American folk culture.

<doc id="994186" wikidata="Q2368408" url="?curid=994186" title="Indianism (arts)">
<text>Indianism () was a Brazilian literary and artistic movement that reached its peak during the first stages of Romanticism in the country, though it had been present in Brazilian literature since the Baroque period.

In Romantic contexts, it is called &quot;the first generation of Brazilian Romanticism&quot;, being succeeded by the &quot;Ultra-Romanticism&quot; and the &quot;Condorism&quot;.

==Historical context==
After the independence of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, a heavy wave of nationalism spread through the Brazilian people. Inspired by this, poets and writers began to search for an entity that could represent and personify the newly created Brazilian nation.

Since there was no Middle Ages in Brazil, it could not be the knight, as in the European chivalric romances; it could not be the Portuguese man either, since Brazilians still held resentment for the years of colonization; it could not be the black man either, since the mentality of the time did not allow it. Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, especially works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the &quot;noble savage&quot; archetype, the authors chose the Brazilian Indian to represent the new nation.

==Characteristics==
Indianist works are characterized by always having an Indian as the protagonist. The poetry is very patriotic and nationalistic, exalting Brazilian fauna, flora, riches and people.

<text>It&#x27;s a Living (renamed Making a Living for Season 2) is an American ensemble sitcom television series set in a restaurant at the top of the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. The show aired on ABC from October 30, 1980, until June 11, 1982. After the series was canceled by ABC, new episodes aired in first-run syndication from September 28, 1985, to April 8, 1989. The series was created by Stu Silver, Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon and produced by Witt/Thomas Productions, later in association with Golden West Television (1985–86) and Lorimar-Telepictures (1986–89). The series is now distributed by Paul Brownstein Productions and Warner Bros. Television Distribution.
==Plot==
The show follows the lives of the waitresses at the posh, fictional restaurant called Above the Top, located atop the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, California. At the helm is supervisor Nancy Beebe, the restaurant&#x27;s maître d’, who sometimes fraternizes with the girls but usually gives orders and demands excellence. The plot often involves annoying Nancy in some minor way. Adding to the elegant but chaotic working environment is wisecracking pianist Sonny Mann, who makes rude comments to the women and receives insults in return. The kitchen is first the domain of Chef Mario, then Dennis Hubner and finally Howard Miller. Howard and Nancy eventually fall in love and marry.

==Cast==

Richard Kline also appears as recurring character Richie Gray, Jan&#x27;s new husband, in seasons 3 through 6.

==Episodes==

The show&#x27;s two broadcast seasons produced 27 episodes. An additional 93 episodes were produced for the syndication run, making a total of 120 episodes.
==Title changes==
As with many other sitcoms from the 1980–81 television season, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; felt the effects of the 1980 Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike, which limited the show to just 13 episodes in its first season.

The series was not a ratings success. For Season 2, the cast was largely retooled and the series was renamed &quot;Making a Living&quot;. Two of the five waitresses from the first season—Lois Adams and Vicki Allen, played by actresses Susan Sullivan and Wendy Schaal, respectively—were removed, and waitress Maggie McBurney, portrayed by Louise Lasser, was added. However, this iteration also failed to find success, and the show was canceled at the end of the season. In syndication, the second season airs under the original title of &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;.

Of all the cast members, only Gail Edwards (Dot Higgins), Marian Mercer (Nancy Beebe Miller), Barrie Youngfellow (Jan Hoffmeyer Gray) and Paul Kreppel (Sonny Mann) lasted through the show&#x27;s network and syndicated runs. Ann Jillian (Cassie Cranston) appeared during the network run and the first year of syndication. Crystal Bernard and Richard Stahl appeared during the entire syndicated run.

==Syndication==
While the show was never a hit on network television, its fortunes would later turn in 1983 when all 27 episodes entered syndication. The series began to attract a following along with surprising ratings for the reruns, which prompted the producers and Golden West Television to revive it. Another factor in its sudden rediscovery was Ann Jillian&#x27;s 1984 public disclosure that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

In 1985, the show was revived under its old name for the syndicated market. Most of the cast remained intact from the former version. A new waitress, Amy Tompkins (Crystal Bernard), arrived at the restaurant and was immediately accepted by the group. Jillian, who had committed to just one season in syndication, left the show in 1986 to continue her cancer treatments. Her character was explained to have married and started a family. She was replaced by Ginger St. James (Sheryl Lee Ralph). With these core cast members in place, the show continued to produce episodes for syndication until it ended in 1989.

From 2000 to 2001, TV Land aired the series occasionally for special programming blocks. In April 2018, Logo TV began to carry the series in marathon form several times a month. Antenna TV ran the series from January 2, 2020 to August 30, 2021, and it later ran on Rewind TV.

It is also available for streaming online on FilmRise and its partner streaming services Pluto TV, the Roku Channel, Tubi and Amazon Prime Video (via Amazon Freevee), under license from the show&#x27;s current distributor, Paul Brownstein Productions.
==Broadcast==
A partial list of stations the show was syndicated to during its revival in syndication:

==International Broadcast==
In Italy, the show aired on Rai Uno (Rai 1) under the name &quot;Nancy, Sonny &amp; Co.&quot; in 1988. It was also known as &quot;Roof Garden&quot;.

<text>A consent decree is an agreement or settlement that resolves a dispute between two parties without admission of guilt (in a criminal case) or liability (in a civil case). Most often it is such a type of settlement in the United States. The plaintiff and the defendant ask the court to enter into their agreement, and the court maintains supervision over the implementation of the decree in monetary exchanges or restructured interactions between parties. It is similar to and sometimes referred to as an antitrust decree, stipulated judgment, or consent judgment. Consent decrees are frequently used by federal courts to ensure that businesses and industries adhere to regulatory laws in areas such as antitrust law, employment discrimination, and environmental regulation.

==Legal process==

The process of introducing a consent decree begins with negotiation. One of three things happens: a lawsuit is filed and the parties concerned reach an agreement prior to adjudication of the contested issues; a lawsuit is filed and actively contested, and the parties reach an agreement after the court has ruled on some issues; or the parties settle their dispute prior to the filing of a lawsuit and they simultaneously file a lawsuit and request that the court agree to the entry of judgment. The court is meant to turn this agreement into a judicial decree. In many cases, the request for entry of a consent decree prompts judges to sign the documents presented then and there. In some cases, however, such as criminal cases, the judge must make some sorts of assessments before the court&#x27;s entry of the agreement as a consent decree.

The usual consent decree is not self-executing. A consent decree is implemented when the parties transform their agreements from paper to reality. The judge who signed the decree may have no involvement or may monitor the implementation. The judge can only step in to assist in enforcement if a party complains to the court that an opponent has failed to perform as agreed. In this case, the offending party would be committed for contempt.

Decrees by consent are more binding than those issued , or against an unwilling party, which are subject to modification by the same court, and reversal by higher courts. The decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. If the decree was obtained by means of fraud or given by mistake, it may be set aside by a court. Errors of law or of inferences from the facts may invalidate it completely.

Typically, a consent decree dispenses with the necessity of having proof in court, since by definition the defendant agrees to the order. Thus, the use of a consent decree does not involve a sentence or an admission of guilt. Likewise, the consent decree prevents a finding of facts, so the decree cannot be pleaded as .

==History==
Because judicial decrees are part of government civil enforcement in settlements that two parties typically agree to before litigation is filed, they act as a hybrid between a judicial order and a settlement without a party conceding criminal responsibility.

Frederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland describe how courts during the 12th century of Medieval Europe used &quot;fines&quot; as a form of court orders to settle land disputes among litigants with the punitive power and legitimacy of courts through the use of consent decree. In the United States, 19th and 20th century legal treatises show that consent decrees and the role of the court in the parties&#x27; settlement was ambiguous. The 1947 &quot;Corpus Juris Secundum&quot; declares that although consent decrees are &quot;not the judgment of the court&quot;, they do have the &quot;force and effect of a judgment&quot;.

===Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure===
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which both went into effect in 1938, lay many of the legal foundations that govern the use of consent decrees. Creating space for courts, which are important actors in implementing a consent decree, to enter into a settlement, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives federal district courts the power to approve class action settlements as long as they are &quot;fair, reasonable, and adequate&quot;. Rule 54(b) defines &quot;judgment&quot;, which refers to consent decree, and allows the court to &quot;direct entry of a final judgment&quot; when multiple parties are involved, and Rule 58 describes the procedure of how parties may enter judgment. Additionally, Rule 60 describes conditions under which parties can be granted &quot;relief from a judgment or order&quot; (such as a consent decree). As Rule 48 in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure stipulates that dismissals in criminal cases may not occur without &quot;leave of court&quot;, Rule 41 allows, if all the parties agree, the court to dismiss any suit besides class action suits, shareholder derivative suits, or bankruptcy action. Many of these rules create the space for consent decree by establishing the role of judges within the settlement of two parties.

===Precedents===
Many of the early court cases involving consent decree set precedents for the roles that judges would play in the negotiating, approving, interpreting, and modifying a settlement between two parties. The role of the judge in regard to consent decree wavers between &quot;rubber stamping&quot; versus applying their own judgments to a proposed settlement. In 1879, &quot;Pacific Railroad of Missouri v. Ketchum&quot; bound the court&#x27;s role in consent decrees to simply supporting to an agreement that parties have already established on their own. In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was &quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot;. With &quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a consent decree could be modified or terminated only when new developments over time bring out a &quot;grievous wrong&quot; in how the ruling of the consent decree affects the parties of the suit. The Supreme Court supported this limited flexibility of consent decrees in &quot;United States v. Terminal Railroad Association&quot;: &quot;[A] decree will not be expanded by implication or intendment beyond the meaning of its terms when read in the light of the issues and the purposes for which the suit was brought.&quot;

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.&quot;, that to promote finality, a court&#x27;s changes to consent a decree should be rare—but the courts can modify a consent decree or frame injunctive relief to ensure the litigation achieves its purpose. Before a judge can enter a consent decree, according to the rulings in &quot;Firefighters v. City of Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Firefighters v. Stotts&quot; they must have subject-matter jurisdiction, and they cannot modify a consent decree when one of the parties objects. The Supreme Court&#x27;s position on how much authority a judge possesses in regard to influencing how the settlement is agreed upon is conflicting. In &quot;Firefighters v. City of Cleveland&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that consent decrees &quot;have attributes both of contracts and of judicial decrees&quot;, so consent decrees should be treated differently for different purposes. In &quot;Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail&quot;, the Supreme Court decided that courts could take into account the changing times and circumstances for more flexibility in the administration of consent decrees.

In regard to litigation in performance rights organizations such as American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Broadcast Music, Inc. in &quot;United States v. ASCAP&quot;, which began in 1941, the Department of Justice used consent decrees (which are amended according to the times and technology) to regulate how they issued blanket licenses to ensure that trade is not restrained and that the prices of licenses would not be competitive. The Department of Justice reviewed the music consent decrees starting 2019, and issued a statement in January 2021 that they would not be terminating them as they still offered several efficiencies in music licensing that maintained benefits to the artists.

==Most frequent uses==

===Antitrust law===

Violations of antitrust law are typically resolved through consent decrees, which began to be more widely used after 1914 with the enactment of the Clayton Antitrust Act. This act began to address the complexities of antitrust economic regulation by recognizing the use of consent decrees as a method for the enforcement of federal antitrust legislation. In amending the antitrust statutes laid out in the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and its supplement, the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), the Tunney Act further specified how consent decrees could be used by establishing that the courts must demonstrate that consent decrees serve the &quot;public interest&quot; in antitrust cases filed by the Justice Department. In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was &quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot; in which the Court used its power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the Chicago meat trust as an unlawful economic monopoly. In &quot;Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, the government used consent decrees to dissolve the horizontal monopoly that John D. Rockefeller had established. Other examples of antitrust consent decrees can be found in a wide range of areas, including their involvement in corporations specializing in technology, the film industry, and the motor vehicle industry.

===Structural reform===

====School desegregation====
The effort to desegregate American public schools began in 1954 with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. This landmark Supreme Court case established that racial segregation of children in public schools was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that states must not &quot;deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot;. To properly enforce this legislation, the Supreme Court allowed district courts to use desegregation decrees obligating states to actively transition into racially nondiscriminatory school systems, with &quot;all deliberate speed&quot;. Since the original decree did not include specific ways this could be done, beginning with &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; in 1971, the Supreme Court specifically defined the objective as eliminating &quot;all vestiges of state imposed segregation&quot; within school systems, including the limited use of busing, racial quotas, the creation of magnet schools and judicial placement of new schools, and the redrawing of school attendance zones. To stop judicial intervention in schools and end the consent decree through a court order, districts must demonstrate desegregation within six criteria defined in the &quot;Green v. County School Board of New Kent County&quot; ruling – which include, student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.

====Police use of violence====
Consent decrees have been signed by a number of cities concerning their police departments&#x27; use-of-force policies and practices, including Chicago, New Orleans, Oakland, Los Angeles (whose consent decree was lifted in 2013), Baltimore, Ferguson, Missouri, Seattle, Portland, and Albuquerque. On June 16, 2023, Minneapolis officials promised to enter into negotiations for a consent decree to be enforced by the DOJ in response to a scathing June 2023 US Department of Justice report resulting from a multiyear federal investigation into the &quot;patterns and practices&quot; of Minneapolis Police Department following the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd by MPD officers.

===Public law===
Consent decrees have been used to remedy various social issues that deal with public and private organizations, where a large number of people are often concerned even if they may not be members of either party involved. Examples have included Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and environmental safety provisions.

====Actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964====

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. Most often, the remedies to workplace discrimination carried out under this Act take place in the form of consent decrees, where employers may have to provide monetary awards or introduce policies and programs that eliminate and prevent future discrimination. These may include decrees that require the creation of new recruitment and hiring procedures to gain a more diverse pool of job applicants, upgrading job and promotion assignment systems, or offering training programs focusing on discrimination and diversity. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was created to be a major advocate and enforcer of the previously mentioned Title VII remedies. In a landmark decision in 1973, the EEOC, Department of Labor and AT&amp;T compromised on a consent decree that phased out discrimination within recruiting, hiring and employment methods in regard to minorities and women. This established a precedent for other large, private U.S. companies to avoid litigation and government oversight by creating decrees in cooperation with Title VII.

====Americans with Disabilities Act====

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a civil rights law passed in 1990 that prohibits discrimination and ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunities and benefits available to the wider American population. Institutions that violate the requirements of the ADA enter consent decrees typically resulting in a payment from the corporation to those wronged, which may serve to discourage future discrimination, in addition to a change in policy to avoid future payouts. Examples of altered practices through the use of a decree have included restructuring building property or the removal of barriers to allow for physical accessibility for all persons, providing supplemental communication tools such as sign language interpreters for those that are hard of hearing, and eliminating discriminatory practices against those that have a disability.

====Environmental law====

Consent decrees have been used to alter environmental policy, one example being the &quot;Flannery Decision&quot;, or the Toxics Consent Decree, entered into by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. This decree, signed in 1976, highly restructured the way the EPA dealt with harmful substances by requiring the agency to list and regulate 65 toxic pollutants and to regulate pollutant discharges on an industry-by-industry basis (i.e., effluent guidelines regulations) rather than by singular pollutants. This decree went on to shape the regulations and administration procedures of water policy within the United States, particularly through the Clean Water Act.

==Effects==
Scholars find advantages and disadvantages to using the consent decree. In addition, consent decrees can affect those outside of the litigants, such as third parties and public interests.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
The following are advantages of using consent decrees:
* Save financial costs of litigation: Consent decrees forgo a court trial that allows for both parties and the courts to save legal expenses.
* Save the time of prolonged litigation: The parties and the courts save the time it would take for a court trial to occur and the courts more quickly clear their dockets.
* Ability to get results of a trial: The parties are able to obtain similar results of a court trial, specifically where a change is required to appease the dispute.
* Parties avoid the uncertainties of a trial: Consent decrees forgo a trial and its unknown outcome, the necessity of proof, and any guilt is taken for granted (because no one is accused by the consent decree).
* Parties have control of the remedial plan: Consent decrees allow both parties to have greater latitude in deciding how to remedy their issues. This is an advantage &quot;because the parties, not the court, determine the remedy, [and] the assumption is that the remedy is better suited to the parties&#x27; needs&quot;.
*More compliance and authoritativeness: Both parties more voluntarily implement their agreements if obtained by consent than by force. Moreover, to fail to act under the consent decree seems to be more a violation of the &quot;law&quot; than if under a contract because the parties are &quot;bound&quot; and not &quot;obligated&quot; by the consent decree. Its authoritativeness is reinforced by the practice that a return to court for a consent decree has a priority in the court queue.
*Sustained judicial oversight and interpretation: Courts can supervise that consent decrees are upheld for an indefinite period of time.

In contrast, the following are disadvantages of using consent decrees:
*Duration: Some argue that &quot;consent decrees often last for too long a period&quot;. Although consent decrees are a solution to a particular issue, the context around that issue or the issue itself may change. However, the consent decree is neither as easy to modify nor adapt and thus can become inadequate.
*Ambition: Consent decrees can be an avenue for those seeking to enact a future-oriented change that is more general and not case-specific. Consent decrees are thus used &quot;as a tool of enforcement [that is] less expensive, and sometimes more far-reaching, than adjudication&quot;, especially in antitrust cases and those involving public institutions.
*Complexity: Consent decrees can be complex in questions of modification, either before or after it is enacted: &quot;the decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. Only where the consent has been obtained by fraud or given by mistake will a bill be entertained to set it aside&quot;.
*Ambiguity: There is ambiguity in the source of power of the consent decree, the role of judges, and the guidelines for a consent decree. Some see that &quot;neither judges, lawyers, nor parties know exactly what they give or get when a consent decree is entered ... [which may bear] testimony to the negative consequences of the ambiguity that surrounds consent decrees&quot;.

===Third parties and public interests===
The consent decree can impact those outside of the parties, who resolve their disputes with a consent decree, especially in settling institutional reform and antitrust cases. From &quot;Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail&quot; and &quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court acknowledges that &quot;the effects of the decree on third parties and the public interest should be taken into account when determining whether or not a change in fact warrants ... the decree&quot;. There is criticism that &quot;the antitrust consent decree is an opaque form of government regulation that operates without many of the checks and balances that constrain and shape ordinary regulatory programs&quot;. So, some argue that the use of consent decrees in antitrust cases and with public institutions can negatively affect third parties and public interests.

== Consent decree in popular media ==
Consent decrees have appeared in various forms of popular media, often as plot devices to explore legal and political themes. 

In the 2024 TV series &quot;Elsbeth&quot;, starring Carrie Preston, the intricacies of consent decrees are highlighted. The show, a spinoff of &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, follows the lawyer Elsbeth Tascioni as she follows the NYPD where she is assigned to oversee a monitorship or consent decree after some controversial arrests.

<doc id="994197" wikidata="Q7041077" url="?curid=994197" title="Nissan VK engine">
<text>The VK engine (formerly known as the ZH) is a V8 piston engine from Nissan. It is an aluminum DOHC 4-valve design.

The VK engine was originally based on Nissan&#x27;s &quot;VQ&quot; V6 rather than the &quot;VH&quot; V8 used in previous Q45/Cima models. Changes include: a variable intake manifold, newly designed heads, and a larger drive by wire throttle chamber. The intake manifold directs air through different paths at different engine speeds to optimise low-end torque or high-end horsepower.

== VK45DE ==

The VK45DE was introduced in 2002 and is built in Yokohama, Japan. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 6,400 rpm with of torque at 4,000 rpm. Redline is at 6,600 rpm. It has an aluminum engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder heads. It uses SFI, has 4 titanium valves per cylinder with Continuous Variable Valve Timing and features forged steel connecting rods, 4 one-piece cast camshafts, an unusual variable-flow induction system optimizes airflow for low- and high-speed operation, low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons, and a microfinished forged crankshaft.

===Motorsport===
A flat-plane crankshaft version of the VK45DE was used by Nismo for Super GT races with the Nissan GT-R instead of using the GT-R&#x27;s VR38DETT twin-turbo V6 engine. The VK45DE was previously used in Nissan&#x27;s 350Z Super GT car in 2007, replacing the previous VQ30DETT used in that car. In race trim, the Super GT VK45DE produces and of torque. The engine idles at around 3,500 rpm and is restricted to the above specified power output. Without such restrictions, the engine is reputedly capable of producing nearly . Nismo reasons that by using the engine, they eliminate turbo lag, save weight and generally prefer the torque curve of the atmospheric V8. Also in the Super GT series, an unbranded VK45DE is used for &quot;Mother Chassis&quot; cars; the engine is labeled the GTA V8.

===Applications===
== VK45DD ==
The VK45DD is a V8 engine that is very similar to the VK45DE but adds a direct injection fuel system. This was Nissan&#x27;s first V8 with direct injection (NEO-Di). It officially produces at 6,000 rpm and at 3,600 rpm, but it has unofficially over . It has a compression ratio of 11.0:1, and a bore and stroke of .

===Applications===
* 2001–2004 Nissan Cima (JDM)

== VK50VE ==
The VK50VE is a V8 engine with at 6,500 rpm and at 4,400 rpm and redline is set at 6,800 rpm. Bore x stroke are and compression ratio is 10.9:1. The valvetrain is a dual overhead cam (DOHC) design with a continuously variable valve timing control system (CVTCS). The engine also features Nissan&#x27;s VVEL valve timing technology.

===Applications===
* 2009–2013 Infiniti FX50
* 2014 Infiniti QX70
* 2015–2019 various LMP3 race cars

== VK56DE ==

The VK56DE is a version built in Decherd, Tennessee. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 4,900 rpm with of torque at 3,600 rpm. It has aluminum-alloy block and heads and low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons. The valvetrain is a dual overhead cam (DOHC) design with a continuously variable valve timing control system (CVTCS) on the intake valves. It also has 4 valves per cylinder with micro-finished camshafts and ductile iron cylinder liners for increased durability.

===Motorsport===

Nismo used the VK56DE for FIA GT1 racing in the Nissan GT-R GT1 from 2010 to 2011. In race trim, it produced and of torque.

The Nissan Motorsport VK56DE was launched in Australia for the V8 Supercars Championship in 2013 by Kelly Racing in Melbourne. The engine has been reduced in capacity to to fit the V8 Supercars regulations. It has a bore and stroke of . It was fitted to a Nissan Altima version of the V8 Supercars &quot;Car of the Future&quot; specification that competed from 2013 until 2019.

===Applications===
Notes:
* The Titan, Armada, and Pathfinder power figures are for regular 87 octane fuel. The Infiniti QX56 &amp; Nissan Patrol are tuned for premium (91+ octane) fuel.
* Some VK56DE powered vehicles are E85 capable.

== VK56VD ==
The VK56VD is a 32-valve, DOHC, Direct Injection Gasoline (DIG) aluminum-alloy V8 and features Nissan&#x27;s latest VVEL (Variable Valve Event &amp; Lift System). The direct injection system provides better wide-open throttle performance and improved fuel economy and emissions performance by reducing engine knock, improving combustion stability and controlling injection more precisely.

<text>Crystal Lynn Bernard (born September 30, 1961) is a retired American singer-songwriter and actress, best known for her roles as Helen Chappel-Hackett on the sitcom &quot;Wings&quot; (1990–1997), Amy on &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; (1985–1989), and K.C. Cunningham on &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1983–1984).

==Early life==
Born in Garland, Texas to televangelist Jerry Wayne Bernard and teacher Gaylon Fussell, Bernard became an entertainer at a young age, singing gospel songs with her older sister, Robyn (1959–2024), also an actress. One recording of the two that has survived from those years is a song called &quot;The Monkey Song&quot; on &quot;Feudin&#x27; Fussin&#x27; and Frettin&#x27; &quot;, recorded when Crystal was eight years old. The recording is from a 1972 Thomas Road Baptist Church service led by Jerry Falwell. In addition to Robyn, she also has two younger sisters: Scarlett and Angelique Bernard. 

Bernard studied acting at Alley Theatre while growing up in Houston, Texas. She attended Spring High School and continued her education at Baylor University, studying acting and international relations.

<doc id="994199" wikidata="Q5146910" url="?curid=994199" title="University and college rivalry">
<text>Pairs of schools, colleges and universities, especially when they are close to each other either geographically or in their areas of specialization, often establish a university or college rivalry with each other over the years. This sports rivalry can extend to both academics and athletics, and sometimes even politics, the middle being typically better known to the general public. These schools place an added emphasis on emerging victorious in any event that includes their rival. This may include the creation of a special trophy or other commemoration of the event. While many of these rivalries have arisen spontaneously, some have been created by college officials in efforts to sell more tickets and support their programs.

==Definition of a sports rivalry==
Rivalries traverse many different fields within society. A rivalry develops from the product of competition and ritualism between different parties. A rivalry is defined as &quot;a perceptual categorizing process in which actors identify which states are sufficiently threatening competitors&quot;. Ritualism is &quot;a series of ... iterated acts or performances that are ... famous in terms &#x27;not entirely encoded by the performer&#x27;; that is, they are imbued by meanings external to the performer&quot;. Everyone that is part of the sports event in some capacity becomes a part of the ritualism. Teams get together before the game to warm up, coaches shake hands with each other, captains have a determinant of who gets the ball first, everyone stands during the national anthem, the fans sit in specific areas, they make certain gestures with their hands throughout the game, they wear specific gear that is associated with the team, and they have the same post-game practices every game of every season of every year. It is through this consistency of playing the same teams yearly that &quot;these rivalries have shown remarkable staying power&quot;. Specifically, it is society&#x27;s drive to disrupt these original rituals that start rivalries. Horst Helle says, &quot;society needs a particular quantitative relationship of harmony and disharmony, association and competition, favour and disfavour, in order to take shape in a specific way&quot;. Society is drawn to this in sports because this is a principal characteristic in everyday life, which can be seen in historic religious rivalries, such as the contemporary example of sectarianism in Glasgow. Within an area, differences between two types of people can drive the start of a rivalry. Competition and support keep the rivalry going.

In sports, competition tests who has better skill and ability at the time of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two teams that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitate towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence &quot;the unity of society&quot;. Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.

==Important contributors that fuel a rivalry==
An important precursor to having a rivalry is having intense competitive play between two sports teams within the ritualistic structure of the game. A competition is &quot;a form of struggle fought by means of objective performances, to the advantage of a third [party]&quot;, which in sports is driven by the team dynamic, and external outlets such as the fans and the media. These external outlets give rivalries more distinctive importance. An example of a rivalry that embodies this is the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry.

===The team dynamic===
In such sports as basketball and football there is a stress on the importance of teamwork. This is so because the team is a smaller society that needs to function properly. This means that they need good communication and get necessary goals accomplished for the team. Because of this, the individual on the team is seen as less important than the group as everyone works toward the goal of making the group the best it can possibly be. Players do this &quot;in the form of obedience to authority, group loyalty, and the willingness to sacrifice for the good of the group.&quot;

===The spectators===
The spectators, also known as fans, of sporting events are the largest population associated with the event. Fans exhibit &quot;intangible feelings of pride, solidarity, and pleasure&quot; for a particular team and brand loyalty, which means that they &quot;heavily identify[y] with a particular team or university and have shown that the self-esteem of these ardent fans can be affected by their team&#x27;s success in competition&quot;. This is important in rivalries because fans can determine the outcome of the game and the overall mood throughout the game. The fans have a lot of power because of this fact and therefore possess indirect power and determination on the outcome of the game.

===The media===
The media connect the team, with the fans and the rest of the world. &quot;The media do[es not] &#x27;tell it like it is.&#x27; Rather, they tell it in a way that supports the interests of those who benefit from cultural commitments to competition, productivity, and material success.&quot; This is known as consumerism because the media influences society&#x27;s emotions to think of the rivalries in a way that will get people to be as passionate about the game as they want to be. It is spectators&#x27; enjoyment of sports and the associated rivalries that drive media sport consumption.

==Americas==

===North America===

====Canada====
* Carleton University and University of Ottawa
These two schools are cross-city rivals in Ottawa, Ontario and have historically had the largest football rivalry in the country. The Carleton Ravens and the Ottawa Gee-Gees played the annual Panda Game from 1955 to 1998, which consistently garnered a national spotlight and was renowned for its size and popularity. The Panda Game was absent for 15 years after Carleton shut down their football program, but was revived in 2013 when Carleton restarted their football program.

The rivalry is also on display on the basketball court, where both schools&#x27; teams are among the best in Canada.
* University of Western Ontario and Queen&#x27;s University
These two universities have one of the oldest rivalries in Canada. Western, located in London, Ontario and Queen&#x27;s, located in Kingston, Ontario are two of the older schools in Ontario and are both notable academic institutions.

====United States====
School rivalries are important in the United States, especially in intercollegiate sports. Some rivalries, such as the Indiana–Kentucky rivalry, take place between two schools from different conferences.

The Caltech–MIT rivalry is unusual for both the geographic distance between the schools (their campuses are separated by about 2500 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States) and the focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events.

==Europe==

===Western Europe===

====Belgium====
* Université catholique de Louvain and Université Libre de Bruxelles.
* Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
Rivalry started in the 1830s when the Free University of Brussels was established as a non-religious and freethinking university whereas the old Catholic University of Leuven – refounded in 1835 – remained under Church control. The rivalry survived the division of the two original foundations into separate Dutch-speaking and French-speaking establishments, in 1968 and 1970 respectively. Nowadays control of the Church over the two catholic universities has diminished and they are largely pluralist, accepting students and professors from all religions and backgrounds, but the rivalry with the two secular universities in Brussels continues. This rivalry finds expression mainly among academics and traditional student activities as intercollegiate sports remain largely developed in Belgium.

====France====
&quot;High schools &amp; Preparatory classes&quot;: Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Lycée Henri IV in Paris, which are commonly seen as the most prestigious public high schools.

&quot;Business Schools:&quot; 
ESSEC Business School and HEC Paris have been fierce rivals with HEC topping most rankings and ESSEC often coming second. However, ESSEC has long been considered an entrepreneurial powerhouse, more dynamic and open-minded than HEC, whilst the latter has constantly been accused of snobbish attitudes due to the elitist mindset of its student population. Whether either assumptions are true or false, those two schools have produced the elite of French business circles, alongside the other &quot;Parisian&quot; business school ESCP Europe, which is usually ranked third in France.

&quot;Engineering Schools&quot;:
The famous engineering schools, such as ParisTech members, usually compete in national sports tournaments, but also in technological competitions such as the French Robotics Cup or the Mash Marathon. In these situations some of the schools chose to form alliances, like Supélec and Arts et Métiers ParisTech that build common robots.

&quot;Other Schools&quot;:
The &quot;Critérium&quot; of the Institut d&#x27;études politiques (IEP) is an annual multi-sport competition between the 9 IEPs. It is traditionally held on the last weekend of March with the host city changing every year. It is the occasion for the IEPs located in French regions to challenge the more prestigious IEP Paris (known as &quot;Sciences Po&quot;). A final opposing Paris to, for example, Lyon would see students from all over France cheering for Lyon, especially with the anthem &quot;Province unie, tous contre Paris !&quot; (&quot;Province united, all against Paris !&quot;, the &quot;province&quot; being a somewhat pejorative term used to designate any place in France outside of Paris). The Paris students would respond by boasting their status as a Grande école and élite institution.

====Ireland====
* University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin
**See &quot;The Colours Match&quot;

====Italy====
* University of Pisa and University of Pavia – the annual Pisa-Pavia Regatta, the second oldest in Europe after the Oxford Cambridge boat race.
* Scuola Normale Superiore and Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa
* Ghislieri College and Borromeo College, Pavia

====United Kingdom====
=====Universities=====
Oxford and Cambridge have a rivalry which dates back to the 13th century; see Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, Blue (university sport), the Boat Race, The Varsity Game, The Varsity Match, the Rugby League Varsity Match, and the Ice Hockey Varsity Match. Colleges within each University are also known to nurture keen rivalries, such as that between Oriel College, Oxford and Pembroke College, Oxford, centred on rowing, that between Exeter College, Oxford and Jesus College, Oxford, both being directly opposite each other on Turl Street, or that between Brasenose College, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford, one of two pairs of &quot;semi-detached&quot; colleges in Oxbridge – the other being Balliol College and Trinity College in Broad Street, Oxford. Another keen rivalry is that between St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, dating back to the time when the Queen&#x27;s College owned St Edmund Hall. In Cambridge, rivalries exist between St John&#x27;s and Trinity, two of the richest colleges of the university and all of Oxbridge. Rivalries have also been established between Colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, such as that between Robinson College, Cambridge and St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford.

University College London and King&#x27;s College London have a rivalry that has been a part of London life for nearly two centuries. It can be traced to their foundation in the 1820s when King&#x27;s College was established as an Anglican alternative to the secular University College. The third-oldest university in England debate between the two universities and other parties continues to this day.

King&#x27;s College London and University of Bradford also have a departmental rivalry. King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s War Studies department faces Bradford University&#x27;s Peace Studies department, in an annual football match for the &#x27;Tolstoy Cup&#x27;. The rivalry between &#x27;War&#x27; and &#x27;Peace&#x27; studies teams is one of the great sporting rivalries, being featured at number four on the Financial Times list of &quot;Great College Sports Rivalries&quot;.

Lancaster University and University of York have a rivalry which has lasted since the formation of the universities at similar times in the 1960s. There is an annual sports competition between the university named the Roses Tournament. The name derives from the War of the Roses, and English civil war fought in the 15th century between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. The first event was held in 1965 and has been an annual tradition ever since.

Northumbria University and Newcastle University have a rivalry based upon the close geographical relationship attributed between both universities, with Northumbria University being situated extremely close to the older Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1994 the Stan Calvert Cup was instituted as a multi-sport competition between the two universities; but in 2018 Newcastle University decided to withdraw from the cup for the foreseeable future.

University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University have a rivalry being the cities two principal universities with the battle for the &#x27;varsity cup&#x27; taking place every year when over 1,000 students from both universities compete in over 15 different sports.

University of Essex and University of East Anglia have an annual competition known amongst the students as &quot;Derby Day&quot;, as well as competing academically.

The rivalry was at a high during the mid 1800s with parties from both schools conducting raids on each other and a wave of &quot;thefts, violence, mass riots and bullying&quot;. This violence and rivalry subsided with the relocating from Watson&#x27;s and the change to both School becoming day schools rather than boarding. Today the rivalry extends only to the sports pitch although there is rumour of a raid in the 1970/80s of a group of Watsonian finding themselves in the Heriots cafeteria with several stink bombs.

==Oceania==

===Australia===

* Prince Alfred College and Saint Peter&#x27;s College
Each sport has an annual intercollegiate showdown between the two prestigious schools, known as the &quot;Intercol&quot;. These are considered by the two colleges to be the most important games of the season, and the fiercely fought matches draw big crowds of students and old scholars from both schools. The Intercols have been played for over 100 years. The Cricket Intercollegiate match has been competed in since 1878. According to Richard Sproull this is &quot;the oldest unbroken annual contest in the history of cricket&quot; (Weekend Australian 5/6 December 1992). For the sport of rowing, the Intercol is competed during South Australia&#x27;s &#x27;Head of the River Regatta&#x27;, on the second to last Saturday of the first school term, with one of the two school&#x27;s taking out the statewide title nearly every year since its beginning. 
* Nudgee College and Gregory Terrace
In 1991, the following legend was printed in the Centennial Rugby Programme, dubbed – &quot;The Battle of The Colours&quot;, for the 100th anniversary of the annual Nudgee vs Terrace rugby match. The legend has it that the two St Joseph&#x27;s, who both wore the Christian Brothers traditional Blue and White, played off in a Rugby game to decide who would keep the prestigious colours. As the story goes Nudgee won the match seeing them keep the colours with Gregory Terrace changing to the now famed Red and Black. This fierce rivalry has continued ever since in every sport yet Rugby continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest, with crowds of up to 10 000 attending First XV fixtures. As two of the biggest Rugby schools in Australia the schools also compete for the St Joseph&#x27;s Cup. 
* Jane Franklin Hall, John Fisher College and Christ College
Intercollege Sport has been played between Jane Franklin Hall, Christ College and St. John Fisher College for many years, with many sports played, most importantly Rugby, Cricket and Australian Rules football. These matches are fiercely contested, indeed playing a part in the winning Rugby side is considered the crowning achievement in ones time at college. Jane Franklin Hall has had the edge in sporting prowess over the years in most sports – with its winning streak in Soccer extending back to the mid 1980s, for example – apart from Rugby which is very tightly contested, with Christ College coming out the victor more often over recent years. Each year, the colleges compete for the Intercollege Cup, which is decided based on points earned from sporting results. Each sport is allocated various points for first, second and third, and weighted to reward the college that wins the more prestigious sports of Rugby, Football and Cricket, with Rugby given the highest weighting.

<text>Rebecca Catherine Barrett (May 1, 1942 – January 26, 2024) was an American-born Canadian politician. She served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party (NDP) government of Gary Doer from 1999 to 2003.

==Early life and career==
Barrett was born in Pensacola, Florida, U.S., and moved to Canada in 1975. She earned a Master&#x27;s degree in social work from the University of Manitoba in 1979, and was a social worker before entering political life. During the 1980s, Barrett was the Manitoba NDP&#x27;s director of organization.

==Politician==
===Opposition member (1990–1999)===
Barrett was elected in the north-end Winnipeg district of Wellington in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Ernie Gilroy by over 1,200 votes. The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba won a majority government in this election, and Barrett was appointed the New Democratic Party&#x27;s family services critic in opposition. In June 1991, she criticized Premier Gary Filmon&#x27;s sudden announcement that Winnipeg&#x27;s child and family services would be brought under a single agency. Barrett later criticized the Filmon government for cutting several Manitobans from social assistance programs without investing in education, job creation programs and skills upgrading. She also introduced a private member&#x27;s bill that, if passed, would have required the Manitoba Office of the Children&#x27;s Advocate to report to the legislature rather than the Minister of Family Services.

Barrett also served as her party&#x27;s justice critic. She called on the Filmon government to remove provincial judge Bruce McDonald from office in 1993, after McDonald was reported as telling a female complainant to &quot;work something out&quot; with a man accused of assaulting her. McDonald was later forced to resign from the bench after the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; uncovered a pattern of questionable behaviour in his decisions. Barrett also called for Manitoba to ban pellet guns in 1993, when a 14-year-old girl required hospitalization after being shot in the leg.

Barrett led the Manitoba NDP&#x27;s candidate search committee in the buildup to the 1995 provincial election, and placed an emphasis on recruiting women and minority candidates. She was personally re-elected, defeating her Liberal opponent by almost 2,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government provincially, and Barrett was named as her party&#x27;s urban affairs critic. In May 1998, she unveiled her party&#x27;s platform for revitalizing the city of Winnipeg. Highlights of the platform included giving more power to city councillors and residents&#x27; associations, providing tax incentives for inner city renewal, guaranteeing stable funding for schools, renewing several aboriginal programs and enacting a new anti-gang policy.

===Minister of Labour and Immigration (1999–2003)===
The New Democratic Party won a majority government in the 1999 provincial election. Barrett did not run for re-election in Wellington, but instead challenged popular Liberal incumbent Kevin Lamoureux in the neighbouring division of Inkster. She won by 143 votes. Barrett was regarded as a strong ally of incoming premier Gary Doer, and there was little surprise when he chose her as a member of his first cabinet.

Barrett was sworn in as Minister of Labour on October 5, 1999, with responsibility for administering the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act and the Workers Compensation Act, as well as for the Civil Service and Multiculturalism. On January 17, 2001, her position was renamed as the Minister of Labour and Immigration, and she was relieved of responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act and the Civil Service.

;Labour
Barrett&#x27;s primary accomplishment in office was to reform Manitoba&#x27;s labour laws, reversing many of the decisions made by the right-wing Filmon government during the 1990s. Her reform legislation, introduced in July 2000, made trade union certification automatic if 65% of employees signed membership cards, allowed interim certifications, ensured that employees would not be fired for convictions involving minor offenses, and gave employees the exclusive right to approve or reject arbitration if a labour dispute dragged on more than sixty days. Barrett argued that the changes were necessary to correct a decade of imbalance under the previous government. The bill was met with intense opposition from the business community and, in response to criticism, Barrett changed the bill to give either party in a labour dispute the right to call for binding arbitration after sixty days. Barrett also allowed parents to take more time off work after the birth of their children and increased Manitoba&#x27;s minimum wage by 25 cents for every year of her tenure in office.

Following extensive consultations, Barrett subsequently introduced reforms to Manitoba&#x27;s workplace safety legislation in 2002. These changes gave workplace safety and health inspectors the right to fine employers who ignore safety violations, required employers to ensure their workers receive proper safety training, and required a written health and safety program for all workplaces with more than twenty employees. Some business groups again opposed these messages, though on this occasion Barrett received support from the labour movement and the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; newspaper. Barrett&#x27;s reforms also made Manitoba the first province in Canada to provide compensation for firefighters who develop certain types of cancer while on the job.

Barrett established an arm&#x27;s-length complaints office for Manitoba&#x27;s Autopac program in April 2000 and signed an official proclamation in the same month to commemorate the 13 Winnipeg civic workers who had been killed on the job since 1978. One month later, she announced the hiring of eight new workplace safety and health inspectors. She announced a new round of civil service hiring in early 2001, with a particular focus on employment equity. Late in her term, she announced that Winnipeg paramedics would be added to a list of essential services not allowed to strike.

Barrett also held a series of public hearings into Manitoba&#x27;s pension legislation in 2003, in the first full review of the legislation since 1984.

;Immigration
Shortly after her appointment to cabinet in 1999, Barrett successfully pressured the federal government to allow Manitoba to recruit more than twice as many immigrants for skilled jobs. Manitoba&#x27;s percentage of Canadian immigration increased in the years that followed, and the federal government again increased the number of targeted recruitment positions in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In 2001, the Doer government introduced a medical licensing program to bring foreign-trained doctors into Canadian practice. Barrett also worked with the federal government to ensure Canada&#x27;s ratification of the International Labour Organization&#x27;s convention 182 against child labour.

;Multiculturalism
Barrett introduced legislation in 2000 to recognize Holocaust Memorial Day in Manitoba.

;Retirement
The opposition Progressive Conservatives targeted Barrett as a vulnerable minister after the business community&#x27;s harsh response to her labour reforms in 2000. She was also criticized for approving a plan that would have allowed Manitoba Public Insurance to divert part of its annual surplus to infrastructural repairs at three Manitoba universities in late 2000. This plan provoked significant opposition, and was later reversed.

In late 2002, Barrett announced that she would not be a candidate in the next provincial election. Her last major act in office was to sign a new agreement with federal Immigration Minister Denis Coderre in June 2003, to increase the total immigration to Manitoba to 10,000 persons per year.

==Federal politics==
Barrett supported Alexa McDonough&#x27;s successful bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995. She later served on a committee that reviewed the federal NDP&#x27;s outreach strategy in 2001, and supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal NDP in 2002–03. Barrett ran federal Member of Parliament Pat Martin&#x27;s successful re-election campaign in the 2006 federal election at Winnipeg Centre.

==2003 onwards==
In 2006, the Auditor General of Manitoba, Jon Singleton, released a report that was strongly critical of the management of the Manitoba Workers Compensation Board under its former chairman, Wally Fox-Decent. In the resulting controversy, it was noted that former WCB chief executive officer Pat Jacobsen had sent a written complaint about Fox-Decent to Barrett in March 2001. Barrett chose to refer the matter back to the WCB board of directors, a decision that some critics later described as an abdication of ministerial responsibility. Barrett&#x27;s successor Nancy Allan argued that she acted properly, as the WCB board held legal authority over the matter. For his part, Fox-Decent rejected Jacobsen&#x27;s complaint as a &quot;poison pen&quot; letter from a disgruntled employee.

Barrett died in Winnipeg on January 26, 2024, at the age of 81.

<doc id="994217" wikidata="Q7041075" url="?curid=994217" title="Nissan VH engine">
<text>The VH series consists of engines built from 1989 to 2001 by the Nissan Motor Corporation. The design consists of a 90-degree V8 with an aluminium cylinder block that features a closed upper deck and a deep skirt. The cylinder heads are also aluminium with a DOHC 4 valves design and pentroof combustion chambers. The production blocks and production head castings were used successfully in various forms of racing including the IRL.

==VH45DE==
The VH45DE is a V8 developed by Nissan for use in the Infiniti Q45 sport luxury sedan (G50 platform) which was released in November 1989. The engine was also used in the Japanese market Nissan President limousine (JG50 platform) which debuted in late 1990. The VH45DE typically generates at 6000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm with a redline of 6900 rpm.

Some of the pertinent features of the VH45DE are forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, 6 Bolt main bearing caps with studs, full-length main bearing girdle, lightweight, floating pistons with molybdenum coating, sodium-filled exhaust valves, cross-flow cooling system, hydraulic lash adjusters, single-row silent timing chain, coil-on-plug ignition system, lifter buckets ride directly on cams to reduce friction, redline of 6900 rpm, compression ratio of 10.2:1, bore and stroke of , dimensions: (L) x (W) x (H).

The VH45DE featured variable valve timing, also known as VTC, from 1990 until 1995. This was during the time that the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; between Japan&#x27;s automotive manufacturers was in effect, requiring all cars sold in their home market to (on paper, at least) produce no more than 280 PS. Due to tightening emissions regulations in the US market, the VTC feature was dropped from the 1996 Infiniti Q45. In the following year, the VH45DE was no longer available in any US market vehicles. The engine continued on in the Japanese market until 2002 in the Nissan President limousine; power was somewhat lower in the President to make it quieter and smoother.

VH45DEs made before 1994 used plastic timing chain guides, and over time these have been known to fail. This results in a noisy valve-train and parts of the plastic guides can end up in the sump and oil pickup, resulting in engine damage. Nissan changed to metal backed chain guides from 1994 onwards. 

This engine was used in the following vehicle(s):
* 1990-1996 Infiniti Q45, at 6,000 rpm, at 4,000 rpm
* 1990-2002 Nissan President, at 5,600 rpm, at 4,000 rpm

The VH45DE became a relatively popular engine swap for other platforms due to being low cost to source and also able to be adapted to a Nissan manual transmission when using an aftermarket adapter plate. The VH45DE is also used in a variety of motorsports ranging from drifting to drag racing, boat racing, and dirt track sprint cars (Australia and New Zealand).

==VH41DE==
The VH41DE is a V8 that was based on the VH45DE. The bore of remained but the stroke was shortened to . Power output for this smaller engine is at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm.

The VH41DE also used a double row timing chain, compared to the VH45DE that used a single row timing chain. Its alternator is also located at the top of the engine which creates an overall narrower engine package which can be handy in engine conversions where it may otherwise foul on the chassis rails.

The VH41DE was used in the following vehicles:
* 1997-2001 Infiniti Q45 , 
* 1992-1996 Nissan Leopard, , 
* 1991-1996 Nissan Cima FY32, , 
* 1996-2001 Nissan Cima FY33, ,

<doc id="994219" wikidata="Q478677" url="?curid=994219" title="Nyanga National Park">
<text>Nyanga National Park lies in the north of Zimbabwe&#x27;s Eastern Highlands. One of the first national parks to be declared in the country, it contains the highest land in Zimbabwe, with green hills and perennial rivers. Most of its terrain consists of rolling downland, sometimes lightly wooded, lying at altitudes between 1,800–2,593 metres (6,560–7,544 feet). Mount Nyangani, the highest point in Zimbabwe, lies in the centre of the park and Mutarazi Falls, Zimbabwe&#x27;s highest waterfall, is in the south of the park. Nyanga National Park incorporates the former Mutarazi Falls National Park on its southern boundary.

==History of the park==

The national park is one of the oldest in Zimbabwe, established as Rhodes Inyanga National Park, a bequest from Cecil Rhodes. The original park borders extended beyond Udu Dam, along the east bank of the Nyangombe River to the north of the current park boundary. This extension was sold in the 1970s, but the Warrendale section, immediately beyond Udu Dam, had been recovered by the early 1980s.

The park nearly doubled in size with the late 1990s purchase of most of the Inyanga Block and Kwaraguza farms. These purchases expanded the national park to the north and east of Mount Nyangani, incorporating some important areas of montane rainforest, the source area of the Kairezi River and Nyama Falls. The incorporation of Nyazengu farm in 2014, previously an enclave within the park, completed the formal protection of Mount Nyangani and the headwaters of the Pungwe River, although Nyazengu had been operated as a private nature reserve until 2000 and as unincorporated council land after the designation and acquisition of Nyazengu farm in 2000.

The current name Nyanga reflects the correct vernacular pronunciation of the area.

==Features==

===Flora===

The vegetation of Nyanga is part of the Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic, within the montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregion. The rainforest is found mainly on the eastern (leeward) slopes, as well as in the steeper valleys on west-facing slopes. It is dominated by Syzygium

Woodlands of dwarf msasa have developed on some westward-facing slopes. Copses of Mulanje cypress survive in areas that are safe from fire.

Treeferns are a very noticeable part of the Nyanga flora, with the common tree fern occurring on the moorlands and the forest tree fern in the rainforests. The Nyanga aloe, &quot;Aloe inyangensis&quot;, is found on higher ground.

Black wattle, introduced into plantations outside the park spread rapidly into several parts of the park. Pine, planted between Rhodes and Mare Dams, also spread. By 1988 it was estimated that around 40% of the park had been invaded by these alien species. The park authorities maintain a continuous eradication programme.

===Fauna===

A wildlife checklist compiled over several years reveals a remarkable diversity of mammals, including occasional sightings of buffalo and lion that stray into the region from the Mozambique lowlands. Visitors are likely to see kudu, reedbuck, klipspringer and several other antelope; predators, including leopard and hyaena, are also present. The African clawless otter is common in the upper Kairezi River, in the northeast of the park.

The park is best known among wildlife conservationists for its populations of blue duiker and Samango monkeys. Neither animal is found outside the Eastern Highlands. The Inyangani river frog is an endangered amphibian found in rocky, fast-flowing streams in the montane grassland.

Lake Gulliver and the Mare, Udu, Purdon and Rhodes Dams have been stocked with trout from hatcheries maintained by the Department of National Parks. The rainbow trout is most widespread within the park&#x27;s dams and streams but brown trout and American brook trout are also present.

===Geography and geology===

The park is dominated by Mount Nyangani which lies in the centre and is the highest mountain in Zimbabwe.

The park is well watered by numerous streams and rivers. The central and eastern parts of the park form part of the Zambezi Basin. The Nyangombe River, whose tributaries include the Mare River and the Nyamuziwa River, and the Kayirezi River both flow north out of the park, ultimately to join the Mazowe River. The Pungwe River rises at the foot of Nyangani and flows southwards through the park before dropping into the densely wooded Pungwe Gorge. The Mutarazi Falls, a few kilometres south of the Pungwe Gorge, have a drop and are Zimbabwe&#x27;s highest waterfall; they drop in two stages over granite cliffs into the Honde River valley, which lies outside the park and is a major tea-planting area.

Five dams have been constructed for recreation and tourist water supply: Rhodes Dam and Mare Dam on the Mare River, Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dams on tributaries of the Mare River and Udu Dam on a tributary of the Nyangombe River.

Most of Nyanga National Park is underlain by granite. The highest mountains are composed of Umkondo Group dolerite and sandstone, with the harder dolerite forming cliffs and ridges and the granite-dolerite contact often forming waterfalls. The Troutbeck dolerite sill, shown in the distance in the photograph of Kwaraguza above, was dated at 1099 Ma.

===Archaeological, historical cultural sites===

Fifteenth to seventeenth century ruins of the Ziwa people (upland culture) have been found throughout Nyanga. The ruins include homesteads, centred on pit structures thought to have been used as cattle-pens and larger hill-top settlements, referred to as Forts. The pit structures were once referred to as slave pits, but that interpretation has generally been not supported by archaeologists and is now discredited. There are three sites which can be readily accessed by tourists: &quot;Chawomera Fort&quot; is located above the Nyangombe River, on a gravel road north of the park headquarters. In addition to the fort, there are several pit structures. &quot;Nyangwe Fort&quot;, near Mare Dam, is the most extensive and best-preserved ruin in the park. It is a top a small hill with good views over the Mare valley. Near the park headquarters is a &quot;reconstructed pit structure&quot; - the homestead around a pit structure has been rebuilt and a site museum established. Several other sites have spectacular locations, such as the fort which overlooks the confluence of the Nyangombe and Nyaumziwa rivers and a small fort on top of a hill just west of Mount Nyangani. However these two sites are not easily accessible.

Associated with the ruins are extensive agricultural terracing and irrigation furrows. Iron extraction was practised, mainly to support the complex agricultural technology.

The core areas of the park were once the private estate of Cecil Rhodes. He acquired it with the aim of growing apples and raising sheep, and spent the last years of his life at his homestead near Rhodes Dam. This homestead is now the Rhodes Museum and Rhodes Nyanga Hotel.

==Accommodation and camping==

===Rest camps===
There are three large rest camps in Nyanga National Park, all of which consist of fully equipped, self-catering lodges. &quot;Rhodes Dam&quot;, which is also the park headquarters, is located near the main entrance in a pine forest. &quot;Mare Dam&quot; is some eight kilometers east of Rhodes, in the center of the park and close to three trout fishing dams and Nyangwe Fort. &quot;Udu Dam&quot; is in the north-west of the park, on the road to Nyangombe Falls.

There are also two lodges at the &quot;Pungwe Drift&quot; (currently leased to a private operator), one located on each side of the Pungwe River, upstream of the Pungwe Falls. There used to be an isolated chalet at Nyamuziwa Falls, but this was closed in the 1970s.

===Camping sites===
There is also a camping ground and caravan park on the Mare River half a kilometer west of Rhodes Dam, and a second camping ground at Mutarazi Falls. The larger Nyangombe camping ground, on the main highway from Mutare to Nyanga town was closed in the late 1990s.

===Privately owned camps and sites===
There are two private facilities within the park: &quot;Rhodes Hotel&quot;, on the south bank of Rhodes Dam, incorporating Cecil Rhodes&#x27; old homestead, and the Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut, on the Kwaraguza road from Mount Nyangani to Troutbeck.

==Places of interest==

===Central and western area===
This is the most developed part of the park, stretching from the park headquarters at Rhodes Dam to Mount Nyangani. The area includes the three rest camps and the five dams. Places of interest which are accessible on dust roads maintained by the park are Nyangombe Falls, Nyamuziwa Falls, Mount Nyangani and the two largest archaeological sites: Nyangwe Fort and Chawomera Fort. This area also includes the main recreational facilities, such as the five dams stocked for fly-fishing and the pony trails office.

===Southern area===
Administered from the Pungwe Drift substation, this region is less developed, with roads only along the edges. Access from the park headquarters is via the &quot;Scenic road&quot;, a gravel road that runs parallel to the Nyanga to Mutare highway. The Pungwe Drift substation and lodges are at the end of a steep dust road, off the Secenic Road. The Pungwe View, from which the Pungwe Falls and Pungwe Gorge can be seen, is on the edge of the Scenic Road. Further south is Mutarazi Falls - the highest waterfall in Zimbabwe, which can also be accessed by most vehicles.

Access to the Thomberutedza Falls requires four wheel drive and the dense Pungwe gorge rainforest can only be accessed on foot. There is a four-wheel drive track that links the Pungwe Drift to Mount Nyangani, through the Nyazengu area.

===Eastern area===

The land east of Mount Nyangani was added to the park in the late 1990s and is administered from the Donjera (Gleneagles) Substation on the former Inyanga Block Estate. The area comprises the eastern slopes of Mount Nyangani, Little Nyangani and Mataka Mountains and the Kayirezi and Nyama valleys. Much of the lower-lying ground is forested with pine and blue gum.

Access by road is from Mount Nyangani along the Gleneagles road or from Troutbeck via Nyafaru. This requires special permission from park headquarters, as the roads are gated.

==Tourism==

===Access===
There are tarred roads from Mutare and Rusape to Nyanga village. The main road to Nyanga town passes through the park shortly after Juliasdale.

===Game viewing===
Although there are no game viewing hides and Nyanga is not primarily a game park, there is a variety of wildlife to be seen, especially in the central and western parts of the park.

===Hiking===

There are numerous hiking paths leading to most of the waterfalls and many of the ruins, and along the rivers and mountains in the park.

The main route up Mount Nyangani is a hike, and has views across the park, much of Nyanga District and further into Mozambique.

===Horse riding===
Short horse-riding trails are available around Nyangwe Fort, the Experimental Fruit Station and Mare Dam, as well as longer trails into Warrendale, beyond Udu Dam. The trails start and end at the Pony Trails office, on the gravel road from the park headquarters to Mare Dam.

===Fly fishing===

The five dams and the Kayirezi, Mare, Nyamuziwa, Nyangombe and Pungwe Rivers are stocked with rainbow trout. Brown trout and brook trout are to be found in Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dam only. The park entrance fee includes a fishing license, valid for all waters open to fishing, except for Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dam, for which a separate license is available. Fishing is restricted to certain times of year.

===Swimming===
River in the park are free of bilharzia, unlike the rest of Zimbabwe. There is a natural swimming pool on the Nyangombe River, near the park headquarters, and a swimming weir on the Udu River below Udu Dam.
Mutarazi Falls

Mutarazi Falls is the highest waterfall in Zimbabwe and the second highest on the Continent. Visitors may leave their vehicles at the car park and take a short hike to the edge of the escarpment for views of the waterfalls and the Honde Valley, approximately 800 metres below.

===Boating===
The park&#x27;s five dams are all suitable for boating and boats are available for hire at Rhodes, Mare and Udu Dams.

<doc id="994225" wikidata="Q4209493" url="?curid=994225" title="Kalan Porter">
<text>Richard Kalan Porter (born November 11, 1985) is a Canadian former singer-songwriter from Medicine Hat, Alberta, and the winner of the reality television series &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; in 2004. He started to sing at an early age and is classically trained, playing several instruments, most notably, the violin and viola. He writes and arranges violin solos for many of his songs.
Porter&#x27;s first single &quot;Awake in a Dream&quot; is the best selling debut single for a Canadian artist to date and has been certified 8× Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. He is also the highest selling solo Canadian Idol singer. In 2013, he was a graduate student in business at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

== Early years ==
Porter grew up on a buffalo ranch outside Medicine Hat, Alberta. He is a classically trained musician. His mother used to take him to music lessons, saying that one day he would thank her, and he has said that he now thanks her. He played in a family band, which played a variety of music, including covers of popular rock and pop songs, as well as their own compositions. In 2004, he was preparing to leave home for Montreal to study viola performance at the Schulich School of Music in McGill University, when he decided to audition for &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;.

Kalan&#x27;s sister MacKenzie Porter would become a successful actress and country and pop musician. Their grandfather Bob Porter was Member of Parliament for Medicine Hat from 1984 to 1993.

== &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; ==
Beating out 8,977 other contestants, Porter was crowned &quot;Idol&quot; on September 16, 2004, in front of a live TV audience. For three seasons he was the only contestant in &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; who had never been in the bottom three or two. In Season 5, Jaydee Bixby made it to the finale without ever being placed in the bottom group.

== Post-&quot;Idol&quot; career ==

=== 2004–2005: &quot;219 Days&quot; ===

Porter&#x27;s first single &quot;Awake in a Dream&quot; was released on October 5, 2004, and debuted at number 1. It spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the charts and has become the best-selling debut single for a Canadian artist to date, as it was certified 8× Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in November 2004. His debut album &quot;219 Days&quot;, released November 23, 2004, debuted at number four on the Canadian albums chart. The album title, &quot;219 Days&quot;, refers to the number of days from his first audition to the release of his debut CD. Since its release, it reached double platinum status in Canada. It was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. Porter completed a cross-Canada, 65-date tour in 2005. Most of these shows were sold out.

In 2006, Porter received three Juno Award nominations: Artist of the Year, Album of the Year for &quot;219 Days&quot;, and Pop Album of the Year. He was a presenter at the 2006 Juno Awards in Halifax. He won MuchMusic&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award for the Favourite Canadian Artist in 2005.

Later in 2006, BMG gave Porter time off before recording his second album. He returned home to his family&#x27;s buffalo and cattle ranch to be with his mother and grandmother. His mother was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, and his grandmother was awaiting surgery.

=== 2007–2008: &quot;Wake Up Living&quot; ===

Porter&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wake Up Living&quot;, was released on August 28, 2007, and debuted at number 7 on the Canadian albums chart. The first single, &quot;Down in Heaven&quot; (which Porter wrote as a tribute to his mother) was available to radio stations from June 4, and reached number 25 on the Canadian Hot 100. 

The music video for the second single from the album, &quot;Destination (Where I Belong)&quot; premiered in November 2007. The track &quot;Walk On Home&quot; was used as the contestant elimination song for &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;″s fifth season.

SOCAN honoured Porter and his co-writer Gregory Johnston with a No. 1 Award for their song &quot;Hurray&quot;, which reached the top spot on the MuchMusic Countdown chart on May 29.

<text>A campaign manager, campaign chairperson, or campaign director is an individual whose role is to coordinate a political campaign&#x27;s spending, broad tactics, and hiring. They lead operations such as fundraising, advertising, polling, getting out the vote (with direct contact to the public), and other activities supporting the effort, directly.

Apart from the candidate, they are often a campaign&#x27;s most visible leader. However, modern campaign managers, particularly at the presidential level, are mostly concerned with executing strategy, not setting it. The senior strategists are typically outside political consultants, primarily pollsters and media consultants.

Particularly for large, well-funded campaigns, campaign managers often manage a huge number of staffers and volunteers in a variety of departments; while also coordinating closely with the candidate and outside consultants. 

In the United States, increasingly, campaign management has been a speciality occupation. The top-tier of managers will move throughout the country working on a different campaign each election cycle. The challenges of building a successful operation from scratch in less than 2 years makes experienced professionals increasingly valuable.

In addition to their past experience, experienced campaign managers also bring with them knowledge of campaign management tools and relationships with political consultants.

The pay ranges for a campaign manager differ depending on the scale of the political race.

<doc id="994228" wikidata="Q2491965" url="?curid=994228" title="Environmental racism">
<text>Environmental racism, ecological racism, or ecological apartheid is a form of racism leading to negative environmental outcomes such as landfills, incinerators, and hazardous waste disposal disproportionately impacting communities of color, violating substantive equality. Internationally, it is also associated with extractivism, which places the environmental burdens of mining, oil extraction, and industrial agriculture upon indigenous peoples and poorer nations largely inhabited by people of color.

Environmental racism is the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards, pollution, and ecological degradation experienced by marginalized communities, as well as those of people of color. Race, socio-economic status, and environmental injustice directly impact these communities in terms of their health outcomes as well as their quality of health. Communities are not all created equal. In the United States, some communities are continuously polluted while the government gives little to no attention. According to Robert D. Bullard, father of environmental justice, environmental regulations are not equally benefiting all of society; people of color (African Americans, Latinos, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans) are disproportionately harmed by industrial toxins in their jobs and their neighborhoods. Within this context, understanding the intersectionality of race, socio-economic status, and environmental injustice through its history and the disproportionate impact is a starting point for leaning towards equitable solutions for environmental justice for all segments of society. Exploring the historical roots, impacts of environmental racism, governmental actions, grassroots efforts, and possible remedies can serve as a foundation for addressing this issue effectively.

Response to environmental racism has contributed to the environmental justice movement, which developed in the United States and abroad throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Environmental racism may disadvantage minority groups or numerical majorities, as in South Africa where apartheid had debilitating environmental impacts on Black people. Internationally, trade in global waste disadvantages global majorities in poorer countries largely inhabited by people of color. It also applies to the particular vulnerability of indigenous groups to environmental pollution. Environmental racism is a form of institutional racism, which has led to the disproportionate disposal of hazardous waste in communities of color in Russia. Environmental racism is a type of inequality where people in communities of color and other low income communities face a disproportionate risk of exposure to pollution and related health conditions.
== History ==

&quot;Environmental racism&quot; was a term coined in 1982 by Benjamin Chavis, previous executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice. In a speech opposing the placement of hazardous polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) waste in the Warren County, North Carolina landfill, Chavis defined the term as:racial discrimination in environmental policy making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements.Recognition of environmental racism catalyzed the environmental justice movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s with influence from the earlier civil rights movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns brought attention to environmental racism in policy making and emphasized the importance of minority input. While environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice movement, throughout the years the term has been increasingly disassociated.
Following the events in Warren County, the UCC and US General Accounting Office released reports showing that hazardous waste sites were disproportionately located in poor minority neighborhoods. Chavis and Dr. Robert D. Bullard pointed out institutionalized racism stemming from government and corporate policies that led to environmental racism. These racist practices included redlining, zoning, and colorblind adaptation planning. Residents experienced environmental racism due to their low socioeconomic status, and lack of political representation and mobility. Expanding the definition in &quot;The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism&quot;, Dr. Bullard said that environmental racism:refers to any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or communities based on race or color.

Institutional racism operates on a large scale within societal norms, policies, and procedures extending to environmental planning and decision-making, reinforcing environmental racism through government, legal, economic, and political institutions. Racism significantly increases exposure to environmental and health risks as well as access to health care.

Government agencies, including the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have often failed to protect people of color from pollution and industrial infiltrations. This failure is evident in the disproportionate pollution burden borne by communities of color, with African American and Latino neighborhoods experiencing higher levels of pollution compared to predominantly white areas.

For instance, in Los Angeles, over 71% of African Americans and 50% of Latinos live in areas with the most polluted air, while only 34% of the white population does. Nationally, a significant portion of whites, African Americans, and Hispanics reside in counties with substandard air quality, with people of color disproportionately affected by pollution-related health issues.

Although the term was coined in the US, environmental racism also occurs on the international level. Studies have shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in developed countries, companies have moved their waste towards the Global South. Less developed countries frequently have fewer environmental regulations and become pollution havens.

== Causes ==
There are four factors which lead to environmental racism: lack of affordable land, lack of political power, lack of mobility, and poverty. Cheap land is sought by corporations and governmental bodies. As a result, communities which cannot effectively resist these corporations&#x27; governmental bodies and cannot access political power are unable to negotiate just costs. Communities with minimized socio-economic mobility cannot relocate. Lack of financial contributions also reduces the communities&#x27; ability to act both physically and politically. Chavis defined environmental racism in five categories: racial discrimination in defining environmental policies, discriminatory enforcement of regulations and laws, deliberate targeting of minority communities as hazardous waste dumping sites, official sanctioning of dangerous pollutants in minority communities, and the exclusion of people of color from environmental leadership positions

Minority communities often do not have the financial means, resources, and political representation to oppose hazardous waste sites. Known as locally unwanted land uses (LULUs), these facilities that benefit the whole community often reduce the quality of life of minority communities. These neighborhoods also may depend on the economic opportunities the site brings and are reluctant to oppose its location at the risk of their health. Additionally, controversial projects are less likely to be sited in non-minority areas that are expected to pursue collective action and succeed in opposing the siting of the projects in their area.
In cities in the Global North, suburbanization and gentrification lead to patterns of environmental racism. For example, white flight from industrial zones for safer, cleaner, suburban locales leaves minority communities in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones. In these areas, unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement, creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality. Furthermore, the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers, since areas with depressed real estate values will save developers&#x27; money.

=== Socioeconomic aspects ===
Cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues. Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer&#x27;s willingness to pay for these goods. CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society. When someone is willing and able to pay more for clean water or air, their payment financially benefits society more than when people cannot pay for these goods. This creates a burden on poor communities. Relocating toxic wastes is justified since poor communities are not able to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment. The placement of toxic waste near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land. Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner and wealthier area, the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a &quot;low-value&quot; area.

== Fossil fuel racism ==
Fossil fuels are interconnected with crises like climate change, racial injustice, and public health. Various stages of fossil fuels include extraction, processing, transport, and combustion, all contributing to harmful pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

The impacts of fossil fuel processing are not distributed equally with Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor as opposed to white, or wealthy communities. These communities experience health hazards from air and water pollution as well as the risks from climate change. Sacrifice zones are the concept associated with these communities where systemic racism intersects with a fossil fuel-based economy. From a perspective by Energy Research &amp; Social Science, the &quot;fossil fuel racism&quot; phenomenon is framed through the argument that systemic racism effectively subsidizes the fossil fuel industry by allowing it to externalize the costs of pollution onto communities of color.

Fossil fuel racism allows for a shift in the focus to the systems and structures that perpetuate these injustices. Implications with this effort follow as climate policy approaches often fail to address racial disparities and focus on broader impacts on public health. There is an urgent need for political and policy solutions revolving around the fossil fuel industry to address systemic injustices perpetuated by fossil fuel production and consumption.

== Impacts on health ==
Environmental racism impacts the health of the communities affected by poor environments. Various factors that can cause health problems include exposure to hazardous chemical toxins in landfills and rivers. Exposure to these toxins can also weaken or slow brain development.

The animal protection organization In Defense of Animals claims intensive animal agriculture negatively affects the health of nearby communities. They believe that associated manure lagoons produce hydrogen sulfide and contaminate local water supplies, leading to higher levels of miscarriages, birth defects, and disease outbreaks. These farms are disproportionately placed in low-income areas and communities of color. Other risks include exposure to pesticides, chemical run-off and particulate matter in the air. Poor cleanliness in facilities and chemical exposure may also affect agricultural workers, who are frequently people of color.

=== Pollution ===
The southeastern part of the United States has experienced a large amount of pollution and minority populations have been hit with the brunt of those impacts. There are many cases of people who have died or are chronically ill from coal plants in places such as Detroit, Memphis, and Kansas City. Tennessee and West Virginia residents are frequently subject to breathing toxic ash due to blasting in the mountains for mining. Drought, flooding, the constant depletion of land and air quality determine the health and safety of the residents surrounding these areas. Communities of color and low-income status most often feel the brunt of these issues firsthand. There are many communities around the world that face the same problems. For example, the work of Desmond D&#x27;Sa focused on communities in South Durban where high pollution industries impact people forcibly relocated during Apartheid.

=== Environmental racism limits improvement ===
Environmental racism intensifies existing health disparities among marginalized communities, with BIPOC individuals disproportionately bearing the burden of environmental exposures and their health consequences. Black children, for example, are still more exposed to lead than children of other racial groups contributing to higher body burdens of toxins such as lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates.

Institutionalized racism in epidemiology and environmental health perpetuates the neglect of BIPOC experiences and contributes to the contribution of structural barriers in research funding and publication. For instance, studies on sperm health predominantly focus on White men, neglecting the reproductive health experiences of men of color despite their higher exposure to environmental toxins. This lack of inclusion in research both perpetuates health disparities and a lack of trust among BIPOC communities due to historical exploration in medical research. Structural racism within research contributes to the marginalization of BIPOC communities and limits the development of effective interventions that can address environmental health disparities.

== Reducing environmental racism ==
Activists have called for &quot;more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice.&quot; The environmental justice (EJ) movement and climate justice (CJ) movement address environmental racism in bringing attention and enacting change so that marginalized populations are not disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and pollution. According to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, one possible solution is the precautionary principle, which states that &quot;where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.&quot; Under this principle, the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity&#x27;s safety. Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general, which would act to reduce the overall burden, as well as reduce methane emissions which in turn reduce climate change.

===Studies===
In wartimes, environmental racism occurs in ways that the public later learn about through reports. For example, Friends of the Earth International&#x27;s Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destroying farms.

Besides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices.

Environmental justice scholars such as Laura Pulido, Department Head of Ethnic Studies and Professor at the University of Oregon, and David Pellow, Dehlsen and Department Chair of Environmental Studies and Director of the Global Environmental Justice Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, argue that recognizing environmental racism as an element stemming from the entrenched legacies of racial capitalism is crucial to the movement, with white supremacy continuing to shape human relationships with nature and labor.

=== Procedural justice ===
Current political ideologies surrounding how to make right issues of environmental racism and environmental justice are shifting towards the idea of employing procedural justice. Procedural justice is a concept that dictates the use of fairness in the process of making decisions, especially when said decisions are being made in diplomatic situations such as the allocation of resources or the settling of disagreements. Procedural justice calls for a fair, transparent, impartial decision-making process with equal opportunity for all parties to voice their positions, opinions, and concerns. Rather than just focusing on the outcomes of agreements and the effects those outcomes have on affected populations and interest groups, procedural justice looks to involve all stakeholders throughout the process from planning through implementation. In terms of combating environmental racism, procedural justice helps to reduce the opportunities for powerful actors such as often-corrupt states or private entities to dictate the entire decision-making process and puts some power back into the hands of those who will be directly affected by the decisions being made.

=== Activism ===
Activism takes many forms. One form is collective demonstrations or protests, which can take place on a number of different levels from local to international. Additionally, in places where activists feel as though governmental solutions will work, organizations and individuals alike can pursue direct political action. In many cases, activists and organizations will form partnerships both regionally and internationally to gain more clout in pursuit of their goals.

==== Indigenous women&#x27;s movements in Canada ====
There have been many resistance movements in Canada initiated by Indigenous women against environmental racism. One that was prominent and had a great impact on the movement was, The Native Women&#x27;s Association of Canada&#x27;s (NWAC) Sisters in Spirit Initiative. This initiative aims to create reports on the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women in order to raise awareness and get government and civil society groups to take action. Though the Canadian federal government decided to defund the Sisters in Spirit Initiative in 2010, the NWAC continues to support women, Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Indigenous peoples in their fight to be heard. In other Indigenous resistance movements there is an emphasis on healing from trauma by focusing on spirituality and traditional practices in order to fight against the forces of patriarchy and racism that have caused environmental racism. Activists and Indigenous communities have also gone through state official legal routes to voice their concerns such as discussing treaties, anti-human trafficking laws, anti-violence against women laws and UNDRIP.  These have been deemed insufficient solutions by Indigenous groups and communities because there are some voices that are not heard and because the state does not respect or recognize the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.

=== Environmental reparations ===
Some scientists and economists have looked into the prospect of Environmental Reparations, or forms of payment made to individuals who are affected by industry presence in some way. Potential groups to be impacted include individuals living in close proximity to industry, victims of natural disasters, and climate refugees who flee hazardous living conditions in their own country. Reparations can take many forms, from direct payouts to individuals, to money set aside for waste-site cleanups, to purchasing air monitors for low income residential neighborhoods, to investing in public transportation, which reduces green house gas emissions. As Robert Bullard writes,Environmental Reparations represent a bridge to sustainability and equity... Reparations are both spiritual and environmental medicine for healing and reconciliation.

===Policies and international agreements===
The export of hazardous waste to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on 30 January 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries. A resolution was signed in 1988 by the OAU which declared toxic waste dumping to be a &quot;crime against Africa and the African people&quot;. Soon after, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) passed a resolution that allowed for penalties, such as life imprisonment, to those who were caught dumping toxic wastes.

Globalization and the increase in transnational agreements introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste.

Environmental justice movements have grown to become an important part of world summits. This issue is gathering attention and features a wide array of people, workers, and levels of society that are working together. Concerns about globalization can bring together a wide range of stakeholders including workers, academics, and community leaders for whom increased industrial development is a common denominator&quot;.

Many policies can be expounded based on the state of human welfare. This occurs because environmental justice is aimed at creating safe, fair, and equal opportunity for communities and to ensure things like redlining do not occur. With all of these unique elements in mind, there are serious ramifications for policy makers to consider when they make decisions.

=== United States legislation and policies ===
Relevant laws and regulations aimed to address environmental racism encompass a combination of tort law, civil rights law, and environmental law. Here&#x27;s a quick breakdown of these laws:

Tort law:

This law allows individuals or communities to seek compensation for damages caused by the negligence or wrongful actions of others. In the context of environmental racism, plaintiffs can use tort law to claim compensation for health issues, property damage, or loss of quality of life due to pollution or other environmental harms.

Civil rights law:

Litigation under civil rights statutes focuses on challenging the discriminatory impact of environmental decisions and policies. Lawsuits may argue that certain actions or policies have a disparate impact on communities of color, violating their civil rights.

Environmental law:

Federal environmental statutes, such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) provide mechanisms for challenging the adequacy of environmental reviews or compliance with regulatory standards.

=== Current initiatives in the United States ===
Most initiatives currently focusing on environmental racism are more focused on the larger topic of environmental justice. They are at both the state and federal levels.

On the state level, local politicians focus on their communities to introduce policies that will affect them, including land use policies, improving the environmental health impacts, and involving their community in the planning processes for these policies.

Fourteen states have created offices that are specifically focused on environmental justice and advise policymakers on how their policies may impact minority populations. Maryland established their Commission on Environmental Justice and Sustainable Communities in 2001. The most recently formed councils were formed in 2022 by Vermont and Oregon.

Federally, the EPA is responsible for environmental justice initiatives including the Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program (EJG2G). The EJG2G provides a clearer line of communication and funding between all types of governments such as state, local, and tribal to make a strong effort to steer towards a more environmentally equitable society.

In April 2023, President Biden affirmed his commitment to environmental justice by introducing the Justice40 Initiative. The Justice40 initiative is a goal to make 40 percent of federal environmental programs go into marginalized communities that have not typically been the target for such programs. This initiative includes things like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool and the training for federal agencies on how to use it to identify communities who may benefit from these programs. This initiative includes several federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It&#x27;s dedicated to community outreach by involving local governments and encouraging the community to have a say in the programs that may be implemented in their communities.

=== Potential solutions ===
Environmental racism is a crucial aspect that needs to be a part of the climate crisis conversation. Learning more about environmental racism, supporting a green economy that uplifts BIPOC communities, and making environmentalism a communal practice are approaches that can address these injustices.

Environmentalism as a communal practice emphasizes the importance of viewing environmentalism as a communal effort rather than a competition between individuals by advocating for the well-being of these marginalized communities as well as supporting efforts that address overarching themes of environmental justice. Following this, understanding environmental racism highlights the concept of environmental racism where BIPOC communities disproportionately bear the burden of pollution and environmental hazards due to discrimination in public policies and industry practice. It is also important to understand the impact of environmental racism and to push for discussions that point out disparities imposed on communities of color. Supporting a green economy is also crucial, it&#x27;s important to advocate for a transition to clean energy as well as uplifting BIPOC communities economically and socially. In addition, being involved within the clean energy sector for marginalized communities is another step to empowering BIPOC communities and leading in environmental protection efforts.

== Examples by region ==

=== Africa ===
====Nigeria====

From 1956 to 2006, up to 1.5 million tons of oil were spilled in the Niger Delta, (50 times the volume spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster). Indigenous people in the region have suffered the loss of their livelihoods as a result of these environmental issues, and they have received no benefits in return for enormous oil revenues extracted from their lands. Environmental conflicts have exacerbated ongoing conflict in the Niger Delta.

Burning of toxic waste and urban air pollution are problems in more developed areas.

Ogoni people, who are indigenous to Nigeria&#x27;s oil-rich Delta region have protested the disastrous environmental and economic effects of Shell Oil&#x27;s drilling and denounced human rights abuses by the Nigerian government and by Shell. Their international appeal intensified dramatically after the execution in 1995 of nine Ogoni activists, including Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was a founder of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP).

==== South Africa ====
The linkages between the mining industry and the negative impacts it has on community and individual health has been studied and well-documented by a number of organizations worldwide. Health implications of living in proximity to mining operations include effects such as pregnancy complications, mental health issues, various forms of cancer, and many more. During the Apartheid period in South Africa, the mining industry grew quite rapidly as a result of the lack of environmental regulation. Communities in which mining corporations operate are usually those with high rates of poverty and unemployment. Further, within these communities, there is typically a divide among the citizens on the issue of whether the pros of mining in terms of economic opportunity outweigh the cons in terms of the health of the people in the community. Mining companies often try to use these disagreements to their advantage by magnifying this conflict. Additionally, mining companies in South Africa have close ties with the national government, skewing the balance of power in their favor while simultaneously excluding local people from many decision-making processes. This legacy of exclusion has had lasting effects in the form of impoverished South Africans bearing the brunt of ecological impacts resulting from the actions of, for example, mining companies. Some argue that to effectively fight environmental racism and achieve some semblance of justice, there must also be a reckoning with the factors that form situations of environmental racism such as rooted and institutionalized mechanisms of power, social relations, and cultural elements.

The term &quot;energy poverty&quot; is used to refer to &quot;a lack of access to adequate, reliable, affordable and clean energy carriers and technologies for meeting energy service needs for cooking and those activities enabled by electricity to support economic and human development&quot;. Numerous communities in South Africa face some sort of energy poverty. South African women are typically in charge of taking care of both the home and the community as a whole. Those in economically impoverished areas not only have to take on this responsibility, but there are numerous other challenges they face. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and class are all still present in South African culture. Because of this, women, who are the primary users of public resources in their work at home and for the community, are often excluded from any decision-making about control and access to public resources. The resulting energy poverty forces women to use sources of energy that are expensive and may be harmful both to their own health and that of the environment. Consequently, several renewable energy initiatives have emerged in South Africa specifically targeting these communities and women to correct this situation.

===Asia===

====China====

From the mid-1990s until about 2001, it is estimated that some 50 to 80 percent of the electronics collected for recycling in the western half of the United States was being exported for dismantling overseas, predominantly to China and Southeast Asia. This scrap processing is quite profitable and preferred due to an abundant workforce, cheap labour, and lax environmental laws.

Guiyu, China, is one of the largest recycling sites for e-waste, where heaps of discarded computer parts rise near the riverbanks and compounds, such as cadmium, copper, lead, PBDEs, contaminate the local water supply. Water samples taken by the Basel Action Network in 2001 from the Lianjiang River contained lead levels 190 times higher than WHO safety standards. Despite contaminated drinking water, residents continue to use contaminated water over expensive trucked-in supplies of drinking water. Nearly 80 percent of children in the e-waste hub of Guiyu, China, suffer from lead poisoning, according to recent reports. Before being used as the destination of electronic waste, most of Guiyu was composed of small farmers who made their living in the agriculture business. However, farming has been abandoned for more lucrative work in scrap electronics. &quot;According to the Western press and both Chinese university and NGO researchers, conditions in these workers&#x27; rural villages are so poor that even the primitive electronic scrap industry in Guiyu offers an improvement in income&quot;.

Researchers have found that as rates of hazardous air pollution increase in China, the public has mobilized to implement measures to curb detrimental impacts. Areas with ethnic minorities and western regions of the country tend to carry disproportionate environmental burdens.

====India====
Union Carbide Corporation is the parent company of Union Carbide India Limited which outsources its production to an outside country. Located in Bhopal, India, Union Carbide India Limited primarily produced the chemical methyl isocyanate used for pesticide manufacture. On 3 December 1984, a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked as a result of the toxic chemical mixing with water in the plant in Bhopal. Approximately 520,000 people were exposed to the toxic chemical immediately after the leak. Within the first 3 days after the leak an estimated 8,000 people living within the vicinity of the plant died from exposure to the methyl isocyanate. Some people survived the initial leak from the factory, but due to improper care and improper diagnoses many have died. As a consequence of improper diagnoses, treatment may have been ineffective and this was precipitated by Union Carbide refusing to release all the details regarding the leaked gases and lying about certain important information. The delay in supplying medical aid to the victims of the chemical leak made the situation for the survivors even worse. Many today are still experiencing the negative health impacts of the methyl isocyanate leak, such as lung fibrosis, impaired vision, tuberculosis, neurological disorders, and severe body pains.

The operations and maintenance of the factory in Bhopal contributed to the hazardous chemical leak. The storage of huge volumes of methyl isocyanate in a densely inhabited area, was in contravention with company policies strictly practiced in other plants. The company ignored protests that they were holding too much of the dangerous chemical for one plant and built large tanks to hold it in a crowded community. Methyl isocyanate must be stored at extremely low temperatures, but the company cut expenses to the air conditioning system leading to less than optimal conditions for the chemical. Additionally, Union Carbide India Limited never created disaster management plans for the surrounding community around the factory in the event of a leak or spill. State authorities were in the pocket of the company and therefore did not pay attention to company practices or implementation of the law. The company also cut down on preventive maintenance staff to save money.

==== Russia ====
=== Europe ===

==== Eastern Europe ====
Predominantly living in Central and Eastern Europe, with pockets of communities in the Americas and Middle East, the ethnic Romani people have been subjected to environmental exclusion. Often referred to as gypsies or the gypsy threat, the Romani people of Eastern Europe mostly live under the poverty line in shanty towns or slums. Facing issues such as long term exposure to harmful toxins given their locations to waste dumps and industrial plants, along with being refused environmental assistance like clean water and sanitation, the Romani people have been facing racism via environmental means. Many countries such has Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary have tried to implement environmental protection initiatives across their respected countries; however, most have failed due to &quot;addressing the conditions of Roma communities have been framed through an ethnic lens as &quot;Roma issues&quot;. Only recently has some form of environmental justice for the Romani people come to light. Seeking environmental justice in Europe, the Environmental Justice Program is now working with human rights organizations to help fight environmental racism.

It is important to note that in the &quot;Discrimination in the EU in 2009&quot; report, conducted by the European Commission, &quot;64% of citizens with Roma friends believe discrimination is widespread, compared to 61% of citizens without Roma friends.&quot;

==== France ====
Exporting toxic wastes to countries in the Global South is one form of environmental racism that occurs on an international basis. In one alleged instance, in 2006, the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was prohibited from entering Alang, an Indian ship-breaking yard, due to a lack of clear documentation about its toxic contents. French President Jacques Chirac ultimately ordered the carrier, which contained tons of hazardous materials including asbestos and PCBs, to return to France.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the UK environmental racism (or also climate racism) has been called out by multiple action groups such as the Wretched of the Earth call out letter in 2015 and Black Lives Matter in 2016.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====
&quot;See more: Environmental racism in Nova Scotia&quot;

In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Africville community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature. Still, indigenous communities such as the Aamjiwnaang First Nation continue to be harmed by pollution from the Canadian chemical industry centered in Southeast Ontario.

Forty percent of Canada&#x27;s petrochemical industry is packed into a 15-square mile radius of Sarnia, Ontario. Immediately south of the petrochemical plants is the Aamjiwnaang reservation with a population of 850 Aamjiwnaang First Nation members. Since 2002, coalitions of indigenous individuals have fought the disproportionate concentration of pollution in their neighborhood.
Environmental racism affects particularly women and especially Indigenous women and women of color. Many of these communities reside in rural areas rich in natural resources that are very attractive to extractive industries. These effects not only pollute the environment but also have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Many of these extractive industries such as oil and gas and mining have caused pollution to water sources, food sources as well as effects in air quality. This has started to affect people&#x27;s bodies, especially those of women. This is because the toxins and poisons from extractive industries affect women&#x27;s reproductive organs, can cause cancer as well as the health of their children. The harms of this activity last through generations in these communities; for example in the Indigenous community of Grassy Narrows in Northern Ontario, they are still dealing with health effects from high mercury levels that have affected drinking water and fish in the region that occurred from a spill in the 1960s.

==== Mexico ====
The Cucapá are a group of indigenous people that live near the U.S.-Mexico border, mainly in Mexico but some in Arizona as well. For many generations, fishing on the Colorado River was the Cucapá&#x27;s main means of subsistence. In 1944, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty that effectively awarded the United States rights to about 90% of the water in the Colorado River, leaving Mexico with the remaining 10%. Over the last few decades, the Colorado River has mostly dried up south of the border, presenting many challenges for people such as the Cucapá. Shaylih Meuhlmann, author of the ethnography &quot;Where the River Ends: Contested Indigeneity in the Mexican Colorado Delta,&quot; gives a first-hand account of the situation from Meuhlmann&#x27;s point of view as well as many accounts from the Cucapá themselves. In addition to the Mexican portion of the Colorado River being left with a small fraction of the overall available water, the Cucapá are stripped of the right to fish on the river, the act being made illegal by the Mexican government in the interest of preserving the river&#x27;s ecological health. The Cucapá are, thus, living without access to sufficient natural sources of freshwater as well as without their usual means of subsistence. The conclusion drawn in many such cases is that the negotiated water rights under the US-Mexican treaty that lead to the massive disparity in water allotments between the two countries boils down to environmental racism.

1,900 maquiladoras are found near the US-Mexico border. Maquiladoras are companies that are usually owned by foreign entities and import raw materials, pay workers in Mexico to assemble them, and ship the finish products overseas to be sold. While Maquiladoras provide jobs, they often pay very little. These plants also bring pollution to rural Mexican towns, creating health impacts for the poor families that live nearby.

In Mexico, industrial extraction of oil, mining, and gas, as well as the mass removal of slowly renewable resources such as aquatic life, forests, and crops. Legally, the state owns natural resources but is able to grant concessions to industry through the form of taxes paid. In recent decades, a shift towards refocusing these tax dollars accumulated on the communities most impacted by the health, social, and economic impacts of extractivism has taken place. However, many indigenous and rural community leaders argue that they ought to consent to companies extracting and polluting their resources, rather than be paid reparations after the fact.

==== United States ====
A US Government Accountability Office study, completed in response to the 1982 protests of the PCB landfill in Warren County, was among the first studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. Nevertheless, the study was limited in scope by focusing only on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.

In response to this limitation, in 1987, the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice (CRJ) directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites. The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites. The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that &quot;the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry&quot;. A second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities and found that three of every five African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites. A separate 1991 study found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located.

In 1994, President Bill Clinton&#x27;s issued Executive Order 12898 which directed agencies to develop a strategy to manage environmental justice. In 2002, Faber and Krieg found a correlation between higher air pollution exposure and low performance in schools and found that 92% of children at five Los Angeles public schools with the poorest air quality were of a minority background disproportionate to Los Angeles&#x27; then 70% minority population.

As a result of the placement of hazardous waste facilities, minority populations experience greater exposure to harmful chemicals and suffer from health outcomes that affect their ability at work and in schools. A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States, published in 2018, found that Black people were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions (soot) than the average American. In a study that analyzed exposure to air pollution from vehicles in the American Mid-Atlantic and American North-East, it was found that African Americans were exposed to 61% more particulate matter than whites, with Latinos exposed to 75% more and Asians exposed to 73% more. Overall, minorities experienced 66% more pollution exposure from particulate matter than the white population.

Carl Zimring states that environmental racism is often engrained in day-to-day work and living conditions. Examples cited of environmental racism in the US include the Dakota Access Pipeline (where a portion of the proposed 1,172 mile pipeline would pass near to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation), the Flint water crisis (which affected a town that was 55% African American), cancer alley (Louisiana), as well as the government response to hurricane Katrina (where a mandatory evacuation was not ordered in the majority-Black city of New Orleans until 20 hours before Hurricane Katrina made landfall).

Overall, the US has worked to reduce environmental racism with municipality changes. These policies help develop further change. Some cities and counties have taken advantage of environmental justice policies and applied it to the public health sector.

===== Native American peoples =====
Native scholars have discussed whether the concept of Environmental Justice make sense in the context of Native Americans and settler colonialism. This is because Native Americans&#x27; legal status differs from other marginalized peoples in the United States. As such, Colville scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker explains that &quot;because Indigenous peoples&#x27; relationships to the state (i.e. the United States) are different than those of ethnic minorities, environmental justice must exceed equality and be able to live up to the concepts of tribal sovereignty, treaty rights, and government-to-government relationships.&quot;

Gilio-Whitaker further argues that the distributive justice model on which environmental racism is based is not helpful to Native communities: &quot;Frameworks for EJ in non-Native communities that rely on distributive justice are built on capitalistic American values of land as commodity — i.e. private property — on lands that were expropriated from Native peoples.&quot; In contrast, Native peoples have very different relationships to land beyond the modes of land as commodity.

Indigenous studies scholars have argued that environmental racism, however, began in the United States with the arrival of settler colonialism.

Potawatomi philosopher Kyle Powys Whyte and Lower Brule Sioux historian Nick Estes explain that Native peoples have already lived through one environmental apocalypse, the coming of colonialism. Métis geographer Zoe Todd and academic Heather Davis have also argued that settler colonialism is &quot;responsible for contemporary environmental crisis.&quot; In that way, it has been shown that climate change has been weaponized against Indigenous American peoples, as Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin deforested the Americas and welcomed warmer weather, which they thought would displace Native peoples and enrich the United States. Thus, &quot;the United States, from its birth, played a key role in causing catastrophic environmental change.&quot; Whyte explains further that &quot;Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an intensification of environmental change imposed on Indigenous peoples by colonialism.&quot;

Anishinaabe scholar Leanne Betasamosake Simpson has also argued, &quot;We should be thinking of climate change as part of a much longer series of ecological catastrophes caused by colonialism and accumulation-based society.&quot;

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Trail of Tears may also be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States. As a result of the former, by 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands and essentially confined them to &quot;lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations.&quot; During World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to Indian reservations, which led to a situation in which &quot;a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands.&quot; A study analyzing the approximately 3,100 counties in the Continental United States found that Native American lands are positively associated with the count of sites with unexploded ordnance deemed extremely dangerous. The study also found that the risk assessment code (RAC), which is used to measure dangerousness of sites with unexploded ordnance, can sometimes conceal how much of a threat these sites are to Native Americans. The hazard probability, or probability that a hazard will harm people or ecosystems, is sensitive to the proximity of public buildings such as schools and hospitals. Those parameters neglect elements of tribal life such as subsistence consumption, ceremonial use of plants and animals, and low population densities. Because those tribal-unique factors are not considered, Native American lands can often receive low-risk scores, despite threats to their way of life. The hazard probability does not take Native Americans into account when considering the people or ecosystems that could be harmed. Locating military facilities coterminous to reservations lead to a situation in which &quot;a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands.&quot;

More recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations. The International Tribunal of Indigenous People and Oppressed Nations, convened in 1992 to examine the history of criminal activity against indigenous groups in the United States, and published a Significant Bill of Particulars outlining grievances indigenous peoples had with the US. This included allegations that the US &quot;deliberately and systematically permitted, aided, and abetted, solicited and conspired to commit the dumping, transportation, and location of nuclear, toxic, medical, and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health, safety, and physical and mental well-being of Native American People.&quot;

==== Australia ====
The Australian Environmental Justice (AEJ) is a multidisciplinary organization which is closely partnered with Friends of the Earth Australia (FoEA). The AEJ focuses on recording and remedying the effects of environmental injustice throughout Australia. The AEJ has addressed issues which include &quot;production and spread of toxic wastes, pollution of water, soil and air, erosion and ecological damage of landscapes, water systems, plants and animals&quot;. The project looks for environmental injustices that disproportionately affect a group of people or impact them in a way they did not agree to.

The Western Oil Refinery started operating in Bellevue, Western Australia, in 1954. It was permitted rights to operate in Bellevue by the Australian government in order to refine cheap and localized oil. In the decades following, many residents of Bellevue claimed they felt respiratory burning due to the inhalation of toxic chemicals and nauseating fumes. Lee Bell from Curtin University and Mariann Lloyd-Smith from the National Toxic Network in Australia stated in their article, &quot;Toxic Disputes and the Rise of Environmental Justice in Australia&quot; that &quot;residents living close to the site discovered chemical contamination in the ground- water surfacing in their back yards&quot;. Under immense civilian pressure, the Western Oil Refinery (now named Omex) stopped refining oil in 1979. Years later, citizens of Bellevue formed the Bellevue Action Group (BAG) and called for the government to give aid towards the remediation of the site. The government agreed and $6.9 million was allocated to clean up the site. Remediation of site began in April 2000.

==== Micronesia ====
==== Papua New Guinea ====

Starting production in 1972, the Panguna mine in Papua New Guinea has been a source of environmental racism. Although closed since 1989 due to conflict on the island, the indigenous peoples (Bougainvillean) have suffered both economically and environmentally from the creation of the mine. Terrance Wesley-Smith and Eugene Ogan, University of Hawaii and University of Minnesota respectively, stated that the Bougainvillean&#x27;s &quot;were grossly disadvantaged from the beginning and no subsequent renegotiation has been able to remedy the situation&quot;. These indigenous people faced issues such as losing land which could have been used for agricultural practices for the Dapera and Moroni villages, undervalued payment for the land, poor relocation housing for displaced villagers and significant environmental degradation in the surrounding areas.

==== Polynesia ====
=== South America ===

==== The Andes ====
Extracitivism, or the process of humans removing natural, raw resources from land to be used in product manufacturing, can have detrimental environmental and social repercussions. Research analyzing environmental conflicts in four Andean countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) found that conflicts tend to disproportionately affect indigenous populations and those with Afro-descent, and peasant communities. These conflicts can arise as a result of shifting economic patterns, land use policies, and social practices due to extractivist industries.

==== Chile ====
Beginning in the late 15th century when European explorers began sailing to the New World, the violence towards and oppression of indigenous populations have had lasting effects to this day. The Mapuche-Chilean land conflict has roots dating back several centuries. When the Spanish went to conquer parts of South America, the Mapuche were one of the only indigenous groups to successfully resist Spanish domination and maintain their sovereignty. Moving forward, relations between the Mapuche and the Chilean state declined into a condition of malice and resentment. Chile won its independence from Spain in 1818 and, wanting the Mapuche to assimilate into the Chilean state, began crafting harmful legislation that targeted the Mapuche. The Mapuche have based their economy, both historically and presently, on agriculture. By the mid-19th century, the state resorted to outright seizure of Mapuche lands, forcefully appropriating all but 5% of Mapuche lineal lands. An agrarian economy without land essentially meant that the Mapuche no longer had their means of production and subsistence. While some land has since been ceded back to the Mapuche, it is still a fraction of what the Mapuche once owned. Further, as the Chilean state has attempted to rebuild its relationship with the Mapuche community, the connection between the two is still strained by the legacy of the aforementioned history.

Today, the Mapuche people are the largest population of indigenous people in Chile, with 1.5 million people accounting for over 90% of the country&#x27;s indigenous population.

====Ecuador====
Due to their lack of environmental laws, emerging countries like Ecuador have been subjected to environmental pollution, sometimes causing health problems, loss of agriculture, and poverty. In 1993, 30,000 Ecuadorians, which included Cofan, Siona, Huaorani, and Quichua indigenous people, filed a lawsuit against Texaco oil company for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the Lago Agrio oil field. After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company, Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste, causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities. Additionally, UN experts have said that Afro-Ecuadorians and other people of African descent in Ecuador have faced greater challenges than other groups in accessing clean water, with minimal response from the State.

==== Haiti ====
Legacies of racism exist in Haiti, and affect the way that food grown by peasants domestically is viewed compared to foreign food. Racially coded hierarchies are associated with food that differs in origin – survey respondents reported that food such as millet and root crops are associated with negative connotations, while foreign-made food such as corn flakes and spaghetti are associated with positive connotations. This reliance on imports over domestic products reveals how racism ties to commercial tendencies – a reliance on imports can increase costs, fossil fuel emissions, and further social inequality as local farmers loose business.

<text>James William Elias Davies, (1913 – 27 June 1940) was an American combat fighter pilot who was the first American-born airman to die in combat in World War II. Davies was shot down and killed on 27 June 1940.

Although born in the United States, his family moved to Wales before the start of the war. As such, he appears in official records as being British.

==Royal Air Force service==
Davies joined the Royal Air Force in 1936, and by 1939 was flying the Hawker Hurricane fighter with No. 79 Squadron RAF at RAF Biggin Hill. The squadron was soon in action after the outbreak of World War II and he was Mentioned in Despatches in February 1940, &quot;for gallantry and devotion to duty in the execution of air operations.&quot;

By the end of June 1940 Davies had already claimed six German aircraft shot down and two shared, to become a flying ace. On 27 June 1940 he was in a flight of three Hurricanes sent up as an escort to protect six aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to the French port of St Valery. The three Hurricanes were attacked by three Messerschmitt Bf 109s over the English Channel, resulting in two of the Hurricanes being shot down, with F/Lt Davies posted as missing, believed killed. His name is inscribed on the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede for airmen with no known grave. 

Davies had already been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, with the citation for the award of his DFC published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; the day after he was posted as missing.

<text>The VQ is a family of V6 automobile petrol engines developed by Nissan and produced in displacements varying from 2.0 L to 4.0 L. Designed to replace the VG series, the all-aluminium 4-valve per cylinder DOHC design debuted with Nissan&#x27;s EGI/ECCS sequential multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system. Changes from the VG engine include switching to a timing chain from a timing belt, and relocating the water pump from the outside of the engine to inside the timing cover where the pump is driven by the timing chain. Later versions featured various improvements, such as variable valve timing, and NEO-Di designated VQ engines replace MPFI with direct fuel injection. 

The VQ series engine was honored in a record 14-straight selections by Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines from the list&#x27;s inception until 2008.

The VQ35DE is built in Iwaki and Decherd, TN. It was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list from 2002 through to 2007 and again in 2016.
It features forged steel connecting rods, a microfinished one-piece forged crankshaft, and Nissan&#x27;s nylon intake manifold technology. It has low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons and the intake is a high-flow tuned induction system. Since its inception Nissan has improved upon the VQ35DE with changes keeping it an efficient class leading V6 engine. The engine was updated in 2005 as the VQ35DE Rev-Up. It included variable exhaust timing, a higher rev limit, and a revised oil pump, boosting the output to 297 crank horsepower. This motor was only found in the manual equipped 350z for the 2005-2006 and the manual equipped G35 2005 through 2007 model years.

Bore and stroke are , with a compression ratio of 10.3:1. It produces at 6,800 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. It has dual CVTC for both intake and exhaust, microfinished camshafts and a redline of 7,500 rpm.

It is fitted to the following vehicles:
===VQ35HR===


The VQ35HR engine was first seen in the US with the introduction of the updated 2007 G35 Sedan model, which debuted in August 2006. Nissan updated the VQ line with the addition of the 3.5 L VQ35HR (for &quot;High Revolution&quot;). It produces (US market: using the revised SAE certified power benchmark) at 6,800 rpm and at 4,800 rpm, using a compression ratio of 10.6:1. As of 2009, the Infiniti EX35 produces and the same torque presumably due to tighter regulations.

It has NDIS (Nissan Direct Ignition System) and CVTC with hydraulic actuation on the intake cam and electromagnetic on the exhaust cam. Reportedly over 80% of the internal components were redesigned or strengthened to handle an increased RPM range sporting a lofty 7,600 rpm redline. A new dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent more free-flowing for all around better airflow. The electrically actuated variable valve timing on the exhaust cams to broaden the torque curve is new over the &quot;DE&quot; engine. The new engine block retained the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4 mm to reduce piston side-loads. This modification, along with the use of larger crank bearings with main bearing caps reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle to allow the engine reliably rev to 7600 rpm. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1, these changes add 6 more horsepower ( total + 3 hp ram air effect not measured by SAE testing = ). Peak torque is up from the older &quot;DE&quot; engine at and the torque curve is higher and flatter across most of the rpm range, and especially in the lower rpm range.

The VQ35HR was utilized in rear-wheel-drive platforms while the VQ35DE continued to power Nissan&#x27;s front-wheel-drive vehicles. In 2010, Nissan introduced a hybrid version of the VQ35HR, pairing the engine to a lithium-ion battery pack.


===VQ38HR===
By 2007, Nissan&#x27;s ambition to increase the competitiveness of the Z33 chassis in Super Taikyu racing resulted in the development of a larger displacement engine based on the original VQ35HR Block. It featured the same bore but longer-throw crankshaft (bore × stroke: 95.5 mm × 88.4 mm). The end result was the VQ38HR powered Nismo Type 380RS-C which went on to dominate ST class 1 racing. The 3.8-liter racing engine in the 380RS-C develops maximum power of more than , and maximum torque of . In order to use this new engine in Super GT GT500, limited numbers of the engine were reproduced in the street-legal Fairlady Z Nismo Type 380RS. The VQ38HR engine mounted in the 380RS is a detuned, street version of the racing engine used in the 380RS-C. The engine displacement remains the same, while the intake manifold and exhaust, air-fuel ratio, ignition timing, VTC and other specs have been optimized for street use. The engine produces maximum power of at 7200 rpm, and maximum torque of at 4800 rpm.

The VQ38HR fitted to the following vehicles:
* 2007–2008 Nissan Fairlady Z Version Nismo Type 380RS-C
* 2007–2008 Nissan Fairlady Z Version Nismo Type 380RS

===Production===
The VQ35HR and VQ25HR engines were built at Nissan&#x27;s Iwaki Plant in Fukushima Prefecture.

==VHR series==

The VHR series is a variation of the VQ-HR engine series with Nissan&#x27;s VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift).

===VQ37VHR===


It was the first production engine from Nissan using VVEL. &lt;br&gt;
It has a compression ratio of 11.0:1, with a displacement of , thanks to a bore x stroke of and a redline of 7,500 rpm. &lt;br&gt;
It is rated at at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,200 rpm, and up to at 7,400 rpm and of torque at 5,200 rpm.

Although the engine VQ37VHR gains only and in the Nissan 370Z Nismo, torque over the VQ35HR and this higher torque arrives at 5,200 rpm vs 4,800 rpm in the VQ35HR, the torque curve itself is improved and flattened via VVEL variable valve timing for better throttle response and low rpm torque.
