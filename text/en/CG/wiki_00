<text>East Bergholt is a village in the Babergh District of Suffolk, England, just north of the Essex border.

The nearest town and railway station is Manningtree, Essex. East Bergholt is north of Colchester and south of Ipswich. Schools include East Bergholt High School, a comprehensive for children aged 11–16, and a primary school.

During the 16th century, its inhabitants became well known for Protestant radicalism. A few of its citizens were martyred during the reign of Queen Mary I, and the Protestant martyrologist John Foxe recorded their stories in his famous work &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; (also known as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;).

East Bergholt is the birthplace of painter John Constable whose father owned Flatford Mill. Flatford and Dedham, Essex, both made famous by John Constable, are within walking distance of East Bergholt.

==St Mary&#x27;s Church and bell cage==

The Church of St Mary the Virgin was built in the 15th and 16th centuries, but is well known for the absence of a tower or spire to house the bells. Work began on a tower in 1525, but Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s fall from grace in 1530 brought construction to a halt and the following year a wooden bell cage was erected in the churchyard. The Bell Cage was built as a temporary structure to house the bells until the tower could be built. It still exists and now houses the set of 5 bells, although it is possible the tenor, which weighs 1 ton 6 cwt 0 qr 8 lb (1,320 kg) and has a diameter 4 ft 6 in (137 cm), was added in 1691. There are rumors the Bell Cage was moved from its original position in the 17th century because the occupant of Old Hall objected to the noise of the bells. The only evidence for this is a 1731 hand-drawn map on vellum that shows the Bell Cage situated to the East of the Church.

The bells are exceptional in that they are not rung from below by ropes attached to wheels, as is usual in change ringing, but the headstock is manipulated by hand by ringers standing beside the bells. The bells are believed to be the heaviest five (A, G, F, E, and D) that are rung in England today, with a total weight of .

==Other important buildings==

* Old Hall has been a manor house, nunnery, army barracks and friary. It now houses the Old Hall Community, a single household of about 60 people who live co-operatively and farm organically.
* Lambe School, a Grade II listed building, now the village hall, was founded 1594 by Edward Lambe.
* East Bergholt Lodge, a Grade II listed property originally built in the 16th century, was for many generations the home of the Hughes and Wake-Walker families.
* East Bergholt Place, home of the Eley family and the garden centre The Place for Plants, is noted for its camellias.
* Stour House was once the home of Randolph Churchill, son of the Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
* Bridge Cottage is a 16th-century cottage used as a location by John Constable.

==Governance==
The parish of East Bergholt is its own electoral ward as part of Babergh District council and is part of the Samford division of Suffolk County Council.
The village has its own parish council made up of 13 councillors. 
The village is twinned with the village of Barbizon in France.

As with some other English towns and villages located on the border of two counties, the postal address and postcode of East Bergholt is actually linked to Colchester which is in Essex. East Bergholt also has Colchester (“CO…”) postcodes despite it (East Bergholt) actually being in Suffolk.

== Climate ==

East Bergholt has a weather station for which data is available. The village experiences a maritime climate with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. See Ipswich Climate data.

== Amenities ==
The East Bergholt Dramatic Society was established in the 1960s. Lady Anne Wake-Walker was president until the 1990s, and was succeeded by her daughter. The group, with about 20 members, meets regularly at the Constable Memorial Hall.

== Housing development ==

In 2014 plans were drawn up for a new 144 housing estate in the north of the village. Local residents responded by erecting multiple signs around the village campaigning for a &quot;No&quot; decision by Babergh District Council. In March 2016, Babergh District Council approved the plans for a new housing development, despite strong opposition from Action East Bergholt Group and many concerned residents. As a result, in April 2017 residents were reported to be considering a fight to become part of neighbouring Essex county rather than the current county of Suffolk.

Despite earlier strong opposition to any large developments within East Bergholt, the parish council has given its support to a large quasi-commercial development within East End, East Bergholt. Thereby exposing itself to future large developments within the village.

<text>Bart Alexander Thompson is the creator of the comic book company Approbation Comics, and is the creator, writer, and artist of titles such as &quot;Vampires Unlimited&quot;, the &quot;Metamutoids&quot;, &quot;ChiSai&quot;, &quot;The Lazarus Factor&quot;, &quot;Chaos Campus&quot;, and &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;. Thompson is the scripter for the first volume of the comic book &quot;Lethal Instinct&quot; for Alias Enterprises and the writer for the remainder of the series. Thompson also writes and edits the series &quot;Blood, Shells, &amp; Roses&quot; for Arcana Studios.

Thompson is also credited as Alex Thompson, Bart A. Thompson (usually in print form), and B. Alex Thompson (a movie credits).

==Bibliography==
===Chaos Campus===
&quot;Chaos Campus: Sorority Girls vs. Zombies&quot; is a comedy/pop culture parody series where zombies have taken over a city and the only hope humanity has for survival lies within the hands of the three sorority sisters- Jamie, Paige, and Brittany. Thompson came up with the concept via &quot;joking around with friends, laughing at all of the &#x27;blank versus blank&#x27; movies that were starting to become popular, and knowing Hollywood will take a decent selling idea and run it into the ground (like natural disaster movies, buddy comedies, and now comic movies and 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s TV). ...we had a game of how adding &#x27;zombies&#x27; to any known property would make it even better. Like Married with Children could be &#x27;Married with Zombies&#x27; or &#x27;Zombies with Children&#x27;... and so on&quot;. The idea stayed with Thompson until he wrote a one-shot that eventually developed into an ongoing series.

Chaos Campus is planned to be a sixty issue story split into three 20-issue acts. So far only the first 20 issues have been released, completing Act 1. Thompson also has plans for a movie adaptation of the series.

<doc id="972868" wikidata="Q5958003" url="?curid=972868" title="Hyperfinite type II factor">
<text>In mathematics, there are up to isomorphism exactly two separably acting hyperfinite type II factors; one infinite and one finite. Murray and von Neumann proved that up to isomorphism there is a unique von Neumann algebra that is a factor of type II1 and also hyperfinite; it is called the hyperfinite type II1 factor.
There are an uncountable number of other factors of type II1. Connes proved that the infinite one is also unique.

==Constructions==

*The von Neumann group algebra of a discrete group with the infinite conjugacy class property is a factor of type II1, and if the group is amenable and countable the factor is hyperfinite. There are many groups with these properties, as any locally finite group is amenable. For example, the von Neumann group algebra of the infinite symmetric group of all permutations of a countable infinite set that fix all but a finite number of elements gives the hyperfinite type II1 factor.
*The hyperfinite type II1 factor also arises from the group-measure space construction for ergodic free measure-preserving actions of countable amenable groups on probability spaces.
*The infinite tensor product of a countable number of factors of type I&quot;n&quot; with respect to their tracial states is the hyperfinite type II1 factor. When &quot;n&quot;=2, this is also sometimes called the Clifford algebra of an infinite separable Hilbert space.
*If &quot;p&quot; is any non-zero finite projection in a hyperfinite von Neumann algebra &quot;A&quot; of type II, then &quot;pAp&quot; is the hyperfinite type II1 factor. Equivalently the fundamental group of &quot;A&quot; is the group of positive real numbers. This can often be hard to see directly. It is, however, obvious when &quot;A&quot; is the infinite tensor product of factors of type In, where n runs over all integers greater than 1 infinitely many times: just take &quot;p&quot; equivalent to an infinite tensor product of projections &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; on which the tracial state is either formula_1 or formula_2.

==Properties==
The hyperfinite II1 factor &quot;R&quot; is the unique smallest infinite
dimensional factor in the following sense: it is contained in any other infinite dimensional factor, and any infinite dimensional factor contained in &quot;R&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;R&quot;.

The outer automorphism group of &quot;R&quot; is an infinite simple group with countable many conjugacy classes, indexed by pairs consisting of a positive integer &quot;p&quot; and a complex &quot;p&quot;th root of 1.

The projections of the hyperfinite II1 factor form a continuous geometry.

==The infinite hyperfinite type II factor==
While there are other factors of type II∞, there is a unique hyperfinite one, up to isomorphism. It consists of those infinite square matrices with entries in the hyperfinite type II1 factor that define bounded operators.

<doc id="972870" wikidata="Q5328107" url="?curid=972870" title="Byron Bay Bluesfest">
<text>The Byron Bay Bluesfest, formerly the East Coast International Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival, is an annual Australian music festival that has been held over the Easter long weekend in the Byron Bay, New South Wales, area since 1990. The festival features a large selection of blues and roots performers from Australia and around the world and is one of the world&#x27;s leading contemporary music festivals.

The festival was founded by Dan Doeppel and Kevin Oxford in 1990 and is run by Peter Noble who joined Oxford for the 1994 event. It has been held at several locations in and around Byron Bay and is currently held at Tyagarah, north of Byron Bay town. Originally running for four days, it now runs for five days, from Thursday to Monday.

The Boomerang Festival is an event within the festival dedicated to Indigenous Australian performance, art and culture.

Bluesfest 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will be held for the final time in 2025.

== Ticketing and Resale ==
Bluesfest has partnered with Moshtix for its ticketing services, ensuring fans have a reliable and secure method to purchase their passes to the festival. Recognizing the need for flexibility and the unpredictable nature of attendees&#x27; plans. Attendees looking to resell their tickets can easily do so by listing their passes on the platform. This partnership reflects Bluesfest&#x27;s commitment to enhancing attendee experience and combatting the issues associated with ticket scalping and fraud.

==History==
The festival began in 1990 at the Arts Factory in Byron Bay as a four-day blues music event over the Easter weekend. It was founded by Dan Doeppel and Kevin Oxford in 1990 and is now run by Peter Noble who joined Oxford for the 1994 event.

It has been held at several locations in and around Byron Bay and is currently held at Tyagarah, 11 kilometres drive north of Byron Bay town. It now runs for five days, from Thursday to Monday. From an original crowd of 6,000, it now attracts annual audiences of over 101,000 across the five days. Patrons range from locals to international visitors from a wide age range, including celebrities such as Matt Damon, Jason Momoa and Chris Hemsworth.

In December 2004, Keven Oxford, a director and founder of the event, left the festival and sold his 50% share of the company to a consortium comprising Michael Chugg (managing director of Sydney-based Michael Chugg Entertainment), Daryl Herbert (CEO of Melbourne-based Definitive Events) and Glenn Wheatley (CEO of Melbourne-based Talentworks), who ran the festival with co-founder Peter Noble. Noble bought out the consortium in 2008 and now owns the festival alone. In 2010 Bluesfest moved to its permanent home at the 120-hectare Tyagarah Tea Tree farm.

In 2014, the Boomerang Festival was introduced as part of Bluesfest. This is an event within the festival dedicated to Indigenous Australian performance, art and culture.

The event will be held for the final time in 2025.

Bluesfest 2020 was the first of 31 Bluesfests to be cancelled, due to event restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2021===
The 2021 event, scheduled for 1–5 April, was cancelled one day before it was to commence after a COVID-19 case was detected in Byron Bay. A public health order to shut down the music festival was signed by the Minister for Health Brad Hazzard. As of 17 February the festival was still going ahead as the NSW Government had approved its COVID safety plan. It was to have been about half the size of previous Bluesfests, and be fully seated. Only Australian artists were to play. Evelyn Richardson, of live performance industry body Live Performance Australia, estimated the sudden cancellation had caused an A$10 million loss. Eddie Brook of the Cape Byron Distillery said that Bluesfest was worth A$100 million to the local economy.

Another event was arranged for October 2021, but on 17 August it was cancelled.

===2022===
The 2022 Bluesfest took place on 15–19 April. Around 100,000 people attended the festival.

===2023===
In November 2022 it was announced that, in addition to the 34th annual Byron Bay Festival being held on 6–10 April 2023, the inaugural Bluesfest Melbourne will take place on 8–9 April. Controversy about the line-up erupted after controversial band Sticky Fingers was included in the line-up. This resulted in Melbourne band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard and rapper Sampa the Great withdrawing from the festival in protest. Bluesfest director, Peter Noble, defended the decision to include the band stating that the lead singer of Sticky Fingers had apologised for his past actions and called for the artists to stop living in the past. After weeks of backlash, it was announced that Sticky Fingers would no longer be on the lineup. Around 70,000 people attended the Byron Bay festival.

<text>PC Weasel 2000 was a line of graphics cards designed by Middle Digital Incorporated (Herb Peyerl and Jonathan Levine) which output to a serial port instead of a monitor. This allows servers using PC hardware with conventional BIOSes or operating systems lacking serial capability to be administered remotely.

The product was introduced in 1999 and began shipping January 20, 2000.

PCI and ISA models are available. The PC Weasel is also connected to a PS/2-compatible keyboard port and effectively emulates a keyboard by converting characters obtained from the serial port to keyboard scancodes.
The card may also be connected to the reset pins of the motherboard and reboot the machine on command.

The PC Weasel is an open-source product. Every purchaser of the board is granted a license for the card&#x27;s onboard microcontroller. The microcode, stored in flash memory, is modifiable using a gcc-based toolchain.

<doc id="972879" wikidata="Q6029801" url="?curid=972879" title="The Amitāyus Sutra">
<text>The Amitāyus Sutra (Sanskrit), ; &quot;Sutra of Immeasurable Life Spoken by Buddha&quot;; Vietnamese: Phật Thuyết Vô Lượng Thọ Kinh; Japanese: Bussetsu Muryōju Kyō (Taisho Tripitaka no. 360), also known as the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra,&quot; is one of the two Indian Mahayana sutras which describe the pure land of Amitābha (also known as Amitāyus, &quot;Measureless Life&quot;). Together with the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, this text is highly influential in East Asian Buddhism. It is one of the three central scriptures of East Asian Pure Land Buddhism, and is widely revered and chanted by Pure Land Buddhists throughout Asia.

The title is often translated in English as either the &quot;Sutra &quot;[on the Buddha]&quot; of Immeasurable Life&quot;, or simply the &quot;Immeasurable Life Sutra&quot;.

==History and translations==

Some scholars believe that the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; was compiled in the age of the Kushan Empire in the first and second centuries by an order of Mahīśāsaka monastics who flourished in the Gandhāra region. It is likely that the longer &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; owed greatly to the Lokottaravāda sect as well for its compilation, and in this sūtra there are many elements in common with the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;. 

The earliest of the Chinese translations show traces of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language, a prakrit used in the Northwest. It is also known that manuscripts in the Kharoṣṭhī script existed in China during this period.

Traditionally the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; is believed to have been translated into Chinese twelve times from the original Sanskrit from 147 to 713 CE. Only five translations are extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon. 

The five Chinese translations are (in order of translation date): 

* &quot;Foshuo amituo sanyesanfo saloufotan guodu rendao jing&quot; (佛説阿彌陀三耶三佛薩樓佛檀過度人 道經; T. 362) - traditionally attributed to the translator Zhi Qian, but it is likely a translation of Lokakṣema (2nd century CE) or someone in his lineage.
* &quot;Foshuo wuliangqingjing pingdengjue jing&quot; (佛説無量清淨平等覺經; T. 361), most likely the work of Zhi Qian. It is likely a revision of T.362 which introduces some verse passages.
* &quot;Fóshuō Wúliángshòu Jīng&quot; (佛説無量壽經; T. 360) in two fascicles, by Buddhabhadra (359–429 ce) and his assistant Baoyun (寶雲; 376–449 ce). Traditionally it has also been attributed to Saṅghavarman, though modern scholars now disagree with this.
* &quot;Wuliangshou rulai hui&quot; (無量壽如來會; T. 310), which is part of the composite Mahāratnakūṭasutra, which was translated by Bodhiruci II (late 6th-century and early 7th-century). This text reflects a &quot;later recension&quot; of the text than the previous three.
* &quot;Foshuo dasheng wuliangshou zhuangyan jing&quot; (佛説大乘無量壽莊嚴經; T. 363), by Faxian (法賢; Dharmabhadra; also known as Tianxizai [天息災]; fl. 980–1000).

Furthermore, there is a Tibetan translation, which is similar to the last two later recensions in Chinese. This is the ’Phags pa ’od dpag med kyi bkod pa (*Āryāmitābhavyūha; D 49/P 760) translated in the 9th century by Jinamitra, Dānaśīla, and Ye shes sde. 

In addition to the translations, the &quot;Sūtra&quot; is also extant in Sanskrit, surviving in a late Nepalese manuscript. The Sanskrit has been directly translated into English by F. Max Mueller. It is a &quot;late recension&quot; type similar to the Tibetan edition. 

There are also several fragments of another version in Sanskrit, along with fragments of Uighur, Khotanese, and Xixia translations.

According to Luis O. Gomez, there are some significant differences between the Sanskrit and the Chinese edition of Buddhabhadra / Saṅghavarman. Gomez writes: the order of the narrative and the argument deviate, sometimes only on minor points, sometimes in major ways; differences in content occur throughout, and range from a regrouping and rearrangement of important themes (in the content and structure of the verse portions, for instance, and in the vows), to significant omissions and additions. The parallels, however, are more and stronger than the divergences, so that our understanding of one version may still benefit from our reading of the other. Two long passages in Sanghavarman&#x27;s version have no correspondence in the Sanskrit (or, for that matter, in the Tibetan) versions. These passages are probably &quot;interpolations,&quot; but we have no way of knowing for certain today where and when they were added to the text.

=== Commentaries ===
There are over twenty commentaries on this sutra written in China, Korea and Japan, all based on the Buddhabhadra / Saṅghavarman translation which became the standard in Chinese Buddhism. 

The Dilun scholar Jingying Huiyuan (淨影慧遠, J. Jōyō Eon) wrote the earliest extant Chinese commentary to the &quot;Sutra of Immeasurable Life.&quot; 

Jizang (549-623) of the Sanlun school, also wrote an early commentary on this sutra&quot;.&quot; 

In Japan, the 12th-century Pure Land scholar Hōnen wrote four separate commentaries on the sutra. 

==Contents==
In the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, the Buddha begins by describing to his attendant Ānanda a past life of the Buddha Amitābha. He states that in a past life, Amitābha was once a king who renounced his kingdom and became a bodhisattva monk named Dharmākara (&quot;Dharma Storehouse&quot;). Under the guidance of the buddha Lokeśvararāja (&quot;World Sovereign King&quot;), innumerable buddha-lands throughout the ten directions were revealed to him. 

After meditating for five eons as a bodhisattva, he then made a great series of vows to save all sentient beings, and through his great merit, created the realm of Sukhāvatī (&quot;Ultimate Bliss&quot;). This land of Sukhāvatī would later come to be known as a pure land (Ch. 淨土) in Chinese translation.

The sutra describes in great detail Sukhāvatī and its inhabitants, and how they are able to attain rebirth there. The text also provides a detailed account of the various levels and beings in the Mahāyāna Buddhist cosmology.

The sutra also contains the forty-eight vows of Amitābha to save all sentient beings. The eighteenth vow is among the most important as it forms a basic tenet of Pure Land Buddhism. This vow states that if a sentient being makes even ten recitations of the Amitābha&#x27;s name (nianfo) they will attain certain rebirth into Amitābha&#x27;s pure land.

Lastly the sutra shows the Buddha discoursing at length to the future buddha, Maitreya, describing the various forms of evil that Maitreya must avoid to achieve his goal of becoming a buddha as well as other admonitions and advice.

A Peace Bell with an enclosure was constructed in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on September 20, 1964. Among its inscriptions is a Sanskrit quote from Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra:

<doc id="972894" wikidata="Q494" url="?curid=972894" title="Beakman's World">
<text>Beakman&#x27;s World is an American educational children&#x27;s television program. The program is based on the Universal Press Syndicate syndicated comic strip &quot;You Can with Beakman and Jax&quot; created by Jok Church. The series premiered on Wednesday, September 16, 1992, on TLC, and three days later on September 19, began a concurrent run in weekly syndication on 220 television stations across the United States through an agreement with Columbia Pictures Television Distribution (whose indirect successor, Sony Pictures Television, currently maintains domestic and international distribution rights to the series).

On September 18, 1993, it moved from national syndication to CBS&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s lineup. At the peak of its popularity, it was seen in nearly ninety countries around the world. The series was canceled in 1997. Reruns returned to national syndication in September 2006, after which it was transferred to local stations such as KICU. The program&#x27;s host, Paul Zaloom, still performs as Beakman in live appearances around the globe.

==Summary==
The program starred Paul Zaloom as Beakman, an eccentric scientist who performed comical experiments and demonstrations in response to viewer mail to illustrate various scientific concepts from density to electricity to flatulence. When his experiments were successful, he would often exclaim &quot;Zaloom!&quot; in a nod to his last name.

Over the years, Beakman was aided in his experiments by a female assistant/co-host just as in the comic strip on which it was based. The assistant changed throughout the show&#x27;s run; for season 1, it was Josie (played by Alanna Ubach); for seasons 2 and 3, it was Liza (played by Eliza Schneider); and for season 4, it was Phoebe (played by Senta Moses). Beakman was also assisted by his fake lab rat Lester. In the pilot episode, Lester was a puppet, but in every subsequent episode he was simply a clueless, crude man (Mark Ritts) in a tattered rat suit. In a running joke, it was sometimes implied that his character was actually supposed to be a rat, particularly in moments where he would appear to be in pain because someone was standing on his tail, because he was being tickled, something was on his prosthetic nose, etc. Just as frequently, however, he was specifically identified by himself and others as a guy in a rat suit, or as a serious actor with a bad agent. Frequently unwilling to help with challenges or other segments, Lester was often persuaded by Beakman with the promise of food.

Another occasional cast member is the unseen cameraman &quot;Ray&quot;, who is played by prop-master Ron Jancula&#x27;s hands. Ray assists Beakman by handing him various items, such as the &quot;boguscope&quot;. It is suggested throughout the program that Ray has a crush on the show&#x27;s unnamed make-up lady. Actress Jean Stapleton also appeared on the show as Beakman&#x27;s mother, &quot;Beakmom&quot;. In some of the skits during the show the character Professor I. M. Boring (also played by Paul Zaloom, in a dual role) makes appearances and talks about various science topics in the episodes.

Zaloom also appeared as various &quot;guest scientists&quot; and historic figures, such as Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford, Robert H. Goddard and Philo T. Farnsworth. When Senta Moses was added to the show&#x27;s cast, the producers began to use a majority of the sound effects from the NBC game show &quot;Scrabble&quot;.One segment of the show was the famed &quot;Beakman Challenge&quot;. During this segment, Beakman would challenge Lester to do a stunt that illustrated a basic scientific feat. During the first season, virtually every challenge related to either air pressure or Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. The show addressed this during the second season, by having Lester exclaim to Beakman (as he was explaining the science behind a trick) &quot;AIR PRESSURE! IT&#x27;S ALWAYS AIR PRESSURE!&quot; In later episodes, the rest of the cast would sometimes have their turn to perform a &quot;Beakman Challenge&quot; under their own name (e.g. &quot;The Lester Challenge&quot; or &quot;The Liza Challenge&quot;, etc.) and challenge Beakman to accomplish the feat. When Eliza Schneider joined the cast for season 2, she would get her own segment in the middle of each show called &quot;Those Disgusting Animals&quot; where Liza would showcase small animals such as slugs or mosquitoes.

Before an experiment, the following verbal warning was given: &quot;Any experiment performed at home should be done with adult supervision and all appropriate safety precautions should be taken. All directions should be followed exactly and no substitutions should be used.&quot; The same warning was given during the end credits.

At the beginning and end of the show, as well as before or after commercial breaks, the show featured short scenes portraying puppet penguins, Don (voiced by Bert Berdis) and Herb (voiced by Alan Barzman), at the South Pole watching &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot; on television. The penguins were named after Don Herbert, who starred as Mr. Wizard in &quot;Mr. Wizard&#x27;s World&quot;. Mark Ritts (Lester) was also one of the puppeteers operating the penguins.

The show&#x27;s theme song and incidental music was composed by Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh and Denis M. Hannigan. The &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot; theme is an amalgam of Zydeco and Synthpop, uses an accordion for its main riff and prominently features a wide array of wacky sound effects. (Mothersbaugh and the show&#x27;s production designer, Wayne White, had previously worked in the same roles on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; which also aired on CBS.)

<text>Vibe is an American music and entertainment magazine founded by producers David Salzman and Quincy Jones. The publication predominantly features R&amp;B and hip hop music artists, actors and other entertainers. After shutting down production in the summer of 2009, it was purchased by the private equity investment fund InterMedia Partners, then issued bi-monthly with double covers and a larger online presence. The magazine&#x27;s target demographic is predominantly young, urban followers of hip hop culture. In 2014, the magazine discontinued its print version.

The magazine features a broader range of interests than its closest competitors &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;XXL&quot;, which focus more narrowly on rap music, or the rock- and pop-centric &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;. The May 1998 &quot;Vibe&quot; article &quot;Racer X&quot; by Ken Li is credited as the basis for the 2001 film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; and the resulting franchise.

==Publication history==
Quincy Jones launched &quot;Vibe&quot; in 1993, in partnership with Time Inc. Originally, the publication was called &quot;Volume&quot; before co-founding editor, Scott Poulson-Bryant named it &quot;Vibe&quot;. Vibe was initially &quot;founded with a test issue in 1992 by Time Warner.&quot; [4] Though hip hop mogul Russell Simmons was rumored to be an initial partner, publisher Len Burnett revealed in a March 2007 interview that Simmons clashed with editor-in-chief Jonathan Van Meter. In May 1994, Meter resigned after Jones prevented the publication of the June/July 1994 issue featuring Madonna on Dennis Rodman on the cover. Meter&#x27;s successors were Alan Light, Danyel Smith, Emil Wilbekin, Mimi Valdes, and finally Danyel Smith again. 

Miller Publishing purchased &quot;Vibe&quot; in 1996, and shortly afterward bought &quot;Spin&quot;. A private equity firm, Wicks Group, bought the magazine in 2006. On June 30, 2009, it was announced that &quot;Vibe&quot; was ceasing publication immediately, although according to &quot;Essence&quot;, Quincy Jones stated he would like to keep it alive online.

After shutting down, private equity investment fund InterMedia Partners bought &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine. They added &quot;Uptown&quot; magazine to &quot;Vibe&quot;″s parent company, Vibe Holdings. Ronald Burkle and Magic Johnson later invested in the company. Vibe Holdings merged with BlackBook Media to form Vibe Media in 2012.

On April 25, 2013 it was announced that &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine along with vibe.com and vibevixen.com had been sold to Spin Media for an undisclosed sum. Spin Media was thought likely to shut down &quot;Vibe&quot;″s print magazine by the end of 2013, which a representative stating: &quot;We&#x27;re still trying to find a print model that makes economic sense in the digital age.&quot; Instead, they cut the magazine&#x27;s frequency to quarterly. In 2014, the magazine discontinued its print version.
In December 2016, Eldridge Industries acquired SpinMedia via the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group for an undisclosed amount.

==Covers==
&quot;Vibe&quot; magazine was known for the creative direction of their covers. R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige repeatedly was on the cover of &quot;Vibe&quot; with countless articles following her career. The trio TLC was photographed for the cover in firefighters&#x27; gear, referencing the fact that member Lisa Lopes burned down the house of then-boyfriend and NFL star Andre Rison. The first non-photograph cover of &quot;Vibe&quot; was an illustration of late singer Aaliyah by well-known artist/illustrator Alvaro; this was Aaliyah&#x27;s first appearance on the cover as well. Other famous cover subjects are Trey Songz, Brandy, Snoop Dogg, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Amerie, Jennifer Lopez, Keyshia Cole, Janet Jackson, Lil Wayne, The Fugees, Eminem, T.I., R. Kelly, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson (whom Quincy Jones&#x27; daughter Kidada had dressed in hip hop clothing, reportedly for the first and only time in the entertainer&#x27;s career), Ciara, who also appeared on the cover numerous times and rap legend Tupac Shakur&#x27;s famous cover story in which he reveals important details about his non-fatal 1994 NYC shooting (two years before his death in Las Vegas, Nevada). Electro-rapper Kesha became the first white female artist to appear on the cover as a solo act in October 2012.

==Content==

Featured segments included the back page list &quot;20 Questions&quot;&#x27;, the &quot;Boomshots&quot; column about reggae and Caribbean music by Rob Kenner; &quot;Revolutions&quot; music reviews; &quot;Vibe Confidential&quot;, a celebrity gossip column; and &quot;Next&quot;, which profiled up-and-coming artists. The magazine also devoted several pages to photo spreads displaying high-end designer clothing as well as sportswear by urban labels such as Rocawear and Fubu.

&quot;Vibe&quot; made a consistent effort to feature models of all ethnicities in these pages. Former editor Emil Wilbikin was frequently credited with styling those pages and keeping fashion in the forefront of the magazine&#x27;s identity during the early 2000s. Many clothing brands created or linked to hip hop celebrities, such as Sean Combs&#x27; Sean John, Nelly&#x27;s Apple Bottoms, and G-Unit by 50 Cent found plenty of exposure in &quot;Vibe&quot;″s pages.

In the September 2003 issue commemorating ten years of publication, the magazine created different covers using black and white portraits of its most popular cover subjects. It also contained &quot;The Vibe 100: The Juiciest People, Places and Things of the Year&quot;.

Many successful writers and editors contributed to the publication, including Alan Light, Jeff Chang, Dream Hampton, Cheo Hodari Coker, Kevin Powell, Erica Kennedy, Sacha Jenkins, Noah Callahan-Bever and Miles Marshall Lewis. Mark Shaw was the magazine&#x27;s art director.

==Expanding the brand==
In addition to the magazine, &quot;Vibe&quot; also publishes books on hip hop culture. To celebrate the magazine&#x27;s tenth anniversary, it published &quot;VX: Ten Years of Vibe Photography,&quot; which featured a bare-chested 50 Cent on the cover. The volume also includes photos of Alicia Keys, RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, Eve, Chuck D of Public Enemy, and Run-D.M.C. Works by prominent photographers Albert Watson, Ellen von Unwerth, David LaChapelle, and Sante D&#x27;Orazio are among the 150 photographs in the hardcover edition.

Other books published under the &quot;Vibe&quot; banner cover the history of hip hop, the women of hip hop, and rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. Additionally, the magazine published a spin-off publication, &quot;Vibe Vixen&quot;, from 2004 to 2007. Aimed at &quot;Vibe&quot;″s female multicultural demographic, &quot;Vibe Vixen&quot; included features on beauty, fashion, and female entertainers. R&amp;B starlet Ciara appeared on the inaugural issue&#x27;s cover.

Spencer was fired in October 1997 and replaced by comedian Sinbad, along with Big Boy as the in-house announcer. As was common practice for late-night talk shows (established by Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin), it had a live band, led by keyboardist Greg Phillinganes; Jones worked with him during productions for Michael Jackson&#x27;s albums &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. The program aired in first-run syndication until the summer of 1998, when it was canceled. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Los Angeles.

Other platforms featuring the &quot;Vibe&quot; brand are &quot;Vibe Online&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s online presence; &quot;Vibe On Demand&quot;, an on-demand network; VLN TV, an online video channel; &quot;Vibe Film&quot;; &quot;MVibe&quot;, a wireless content provider for hand-held devices as well as CD and DVD lines distributed under the same name; and &quot;The Vibe Music Mixer&quot;, is available for iPhone and iPad.

In May 2015, &quot;Vibe&quot; expanded its brand by adding the digital extension, &quot;Vibe Viva&quot;. &quot;Vibe Viva&quot; is a space where Latinos can explore their rich history, and see what is driving Latin culture.

In October 2019 &quot;Vibe&quot; co-hosted Billboard&#x27;s 2019 Hip Hop Power Players event in NYC.

==Vibe Awards==

Beginning in 2003, &quot;Vibe&quot; produced and aired its annual awards show on UPN through 2006, and VH1 Soul in 2007.

An incident occurred at the 2004 &quot;Vibe Awards&quot; taping at the Santa Monica Airport hangar, in which G-Unit rapper Young Buck stabbed 26-year-old Los Angeles native, Jimmy James Johnson after Johnson approached Dr. Dre under the pretense of asking for an autograph, and then assaulted him. Young Buck later pleaded no contest to a charge of &quot;assault likely to produce great bodily harm,&quot; and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and 80 hours of community service.

==Other editions==

&quot;Vibe Vixen&quot; was a magazine geared towards female readers of &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine that covered beauty, dating, entertainment, fashion, and societal issues for &quot;urban minded females&quot;. The magazine was initially released in fall of 2004, and sales were considered successful enough for the magazine to be issued on a quarterly basis. &quot;Vibe Vixen&quot; folded after its August/September 2007 issue due to low circulation. Stars featured on &quot;Vibe Vixen&quot;″s covers included Ciara, Tracee Ellis Ross, Kimora Lee Simmons, Kelis, Lauren London, LaLa Anthony and Tia Mowry.

<text>Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton, PC (; 15 August 179813 July 1869) was a British Whig and Liberal Party politician of the mid-19th century.

==Background and education==
Labouchere was born in London into a prominent family, the son of Peter Cesar Labouchere of Hylands, a Dutch-born banker of French Huguenot ancestry who had settled in England, and his wife Dorothy Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Baring. He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his B.A. (1821) and his M.A. (1828).

==Political career==
In 1826, Labouchere became MP for St Michael, as a Whig. In 1830, he moved to the Taunton seat, which he held until 1859. In 1835 he was opposed by Benjamin Disraeli for the Taunton seat; Labouchere won by 452 votes to 282. He was first appointed to office by Lord Grey in 1832, serving as Civil Lord of the Admiralty . After beginning the second Melbourne ministry as Master of the Mint, Privy Counsellor, and Vice-President of the Board of Trade (and, later, Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies), Labouchere was raised to a cabinet post, President of the Board of Trade, which he held from 1839 until the Melbourne government fell in 1841.

When the Whigs, now led by Lord John Russell, returned to office in 1846, Labouchere returned to the cabinet, this time as Chief Secretary for Ireland. Under his administration the worst effects of the Great Irish Famine began to be felt in Ireland. The following year, he once again became President of the Board of Trade, and stayed in that post until Russell&#x27;s government fell in 1852. From 1853 to 1854 he sat on the Royal Commission on the City of London.
Labouchere&#x27;s final cabinet posting came during the first Palmerston ministry, for which he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1855 to 1858. In 1859, Labouchere was raised to the peerage as Baron Taunton, of Taunton in the County of Somerset. Between 1864 and 1868 the then Lord Taunton chaired the Schools Enquiry Commission.

==Family==
In 1840 Labouchere married his first cousin Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Baring. They had three daughters:
* Emily (1844–1933) who married Henry Eliot, 5th Earl of St Germans
* Mina Francis, who married Sir Arthur Ellis
* Mary Dorothy who married Edward James Stanley MP

Frances Labouchere died in May 1850, aged 36, in premature childbirth. 

In 1852 Labouchere married Lady Mary Howard (1823–1892), a daughter of the Earl of Carlisle. There were no children from this marriage. Lady Mary was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Charlynch, Somerset where a reredos was erected in 1893 in her memory.

Taunton died in July 1869, aged 70, at his London house in Belgrave Square. He was buried near his country house Quantock Lodge at Over Stowey. As he had no sons, the barony became extinct on his death. His nephew, also Henry Labouchere, inherited part of his fortune, and later became a well-known newspaper editor and politician.

<doc id="972912" wikidata="Q334396" url="?curid=972912" title="Henry Labouchère">
<text>Henry Du Pré Labouchère (9 November 1831 – 15 January 1912) was an English politician, writer, publisher and theatre owner in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. He is now most remembered for the Labouchère Amendment, which for the first time criminalised all male homosexual activity in the United Kingdom.

Labouchère, who came from a wealthy Huguenot banking family, was a junior member of the British diplomatic service before briefly serving in Parliament in 1865–68. He lived with the actress Henrietta Hodson from 1868, and they married in 1887. He made a name for himself as a journalist and theatre producer, first buying a stake in &quot;The Daily News&quot; and in 1876 founding the magazine &quot;Truth&quot;, which he bankrolled during an extensive series of libel suits. 

In 1880, he returned to Parliament as the Liberal member for Northampton, and became a key figure in the radical Home Rule wing of the party. He was a controversial figure, and opposition from Queen Victoria as well as from senior Liberals ensured that he was never given a ministerial position. He became increasingly unpopular because of his opposition to the Second Boer War, and resigned from politics in 1906, when he left Britain and retired to Italy.

==Early life==
Labouchère was born in London to a family of Huguenot extraction, the eldest of three sons and six daughters of John Peter Labouchère (d. 1863) and Mary Louisa &quot;née&quot; Du Pré (1799–1863). John, who settled at Broome Hall, was a partner in the banking house of Thomas Hope, and then in Deacon&#x27;s; his uncle, also called Henry Labouchère (d. 1869), entered politics and served in Parliament from 1826 to 1859, when he was made a peer as Baron Taunton. Despite disapproving of Labouchère, his uncle helped the young man&#x27;s early career and left him a sizeable inheritance when he died leaving no male heir. His grandfather Pierre (Peter) César Labouchère was also a partner in Hope&#x27;s, and married a daughter of Sir Francis Baring. His mother Mary was from an English nabob family, the daughter of James Du Pré MP, a nephew of Lord Caledon, and his wife Madeline Maxwell, a niece of the Duchess of Gordon.

Labouchère was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where, he later said, he &quot;diligently attended the racecourse at Newmarket&quot;, losing £6,000 in gambling in two years. He was accused of cheating in an examination, and his degree was withheld. Leaving Cambridge, he was sent to South America to look after family business interests there; however, he ended up working in a circus troupe in Mexico and lived for several months in an Ojibwe camp near Minneapolis.

==Early diplomatic and political career==

While he was in the US, Labouchère (without his prior knowledge) was found a place in the British diplomatic service by his family. Between 1854 and 1864, he served as a minor diplomat in Washington, Munich, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Saint Petersburg, Dresden, and Constantinople. He was, however, not known for his diplomatic demeanour, and acted impudently on occasion. He went too far when he wrote to the Foreign Secretary to refuse a posting offered to him, &quot;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship&#x27;s despatch, informing me of my promotion as Second Secretary to Her Majesty&#x27;s Legation at Buenos Ayres. I beg to state that, if residing at Baden-Baden I can fulfil those duties, I shall be pleased to accept the appointment.&quot; He was politely told that there was no further use for his services.

The year after his dismissal, Labouchère was elected at the 1865 general election as a member of parliament (MP) for Windsor, as a Liberal. However, that election was overturned on petition, and in April 1867 he was elected at a by-election as an MP for Middlesex. At the 1868 election he lost the seat by 110 votes. He did not return to the House of Commons for 12 years.

==Theatre producer, journalist and writer==
In 1867, Labouchère and his partners engaged the architect C. J. Phipps and the artists Albert Moore and Telbin to remodel the large St. Martins Hall to create Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Long Acre. A new company of players was formed, including Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, Ellen Terry, and Henrietta Hodson. By 1868, Hodson and Labouchère were living together out of wedlock, as they could not marry until her first husband died in 1887. Labouchère bought out his partners and used the theatre to promote Hodson&#x27;s talents; the theatre made a loss, Hodson retired, and the theatre closed in 1879. The couple finally married in 1887. They had one child together, Mary Dorothea (Dora) Labouchère (1884–1944).
During the break in his Parliamentary career, Labouchère gained renown as a journalist, editor, and publisher, sending witty dispatches from Paris during the Siege of Paris in 1870–1871, noting the eating of zoo elephants, donkeys, cats and rats when food supplies ran low. This series of articles helped restore the circulation of the &quot;Daily News&quot;, in which he had bought a stake in 1868. His unflinching style gained a large audience for first his reporting, and later his personal weekly journal, &quot;Truth&quot; (started in 1876), which was often sued for libel. With his inherited wealth, he could afford to defend such suits. Labouchère&#x27;s claims to being impartial were ridiculed by his critics, including W. S. Gilbert (who had been an object of Labouchère&#x27;s theatrical criticism) in Gilbert&#x27;s comic opera &quot;His Excellency&quot; (&quot;see illustration at right&quot;). In 1877, Gilbert had engaged in a public feud with Labouchère&#x27;s lover Henrietta Hodson.

Labouchère was a vehement opponent of feminism; he campaigned in &quot;Truth&quot; against the suffrage movement, ridiculing and belittling women who sought the right to vote. He was also a virulent anti-semite, opposed to Jewish participation in British life, using &quot;Truth&quot; to campaign against &quot;Hebrew barons&quot; and their supposedly excessive influence, &quot;Jewish exclusivity&quot; and &quot;Jewish cowardice&quot;. One of the victims of his attacks was Edward Levy-Lawson, proprietor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. In 1879 there was a much-reported court case following a fracas on the doorstep of the Beefsteak Club between Labouchère and Levy-Lawson. The committee of the club expelled Labouchère, who successfully sought a court ruling that they had no right to do so.

==Return to Parliament==

Labouchère returned to Parliament in the 1880 election, when he and Charles Bradlaugh, both Liberals, won the two seats for Northampton. (Bradlaugh&#x27;s then-controversial atheism led Labouchère, a closet agnostic, to refer sardonically to himself as &quot;the Christian member for Northampton&quot;.)

In 1884, Labouchère unsuccessfully proposed legislation to extend the existing laws against cruelty to animals. In 1885, Labouchère, whose libertarian stances did not preclude a fierce homophobia, drafted the Labouchère Amendment as a last-minute addition to a Parliamentary Bill that had nothing to do with homosexuality. His amendment outlawed &quot;gross indecency&quot;; sodomy was already a crime, but Labouchère&#x27;s Amendment now criminalised any sexual activity between men. Ten years later the Labouchère Amendment allowed for the prosecution of Oscar Wilde, who was given the maximum sentence of two years&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. Labouchère expressed regret that Wilde&#x27;s sentence was so short, and would have preferred the seven-year term he had originally proposed in the Amendment.
During the 1880s, the Liberal Party faced a split between a Radical wing (led by Joseph Chamberlain) and a Whig wing (led by the Marquess of Hartington), with its party leader, William Ewart Gladstone straddling the middle. Labouchère was a firm and vocal Radical, who tried to create a governing coalition between the Radicals and the Irish Nationalists that would exclude or marginalise the Whigs. This plan was wrecked in 1886, when, after Gladstone came out for Home Rule, a large contingent of both Radicals and Whigs chose to leave the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Unionist Party allied with the Conservatives.

Between 1886 and 1892, a Conservative government was in power, and Labouchère worked tirelessly to remove them from office. When the government was turned out in 1892, and Gladstone was called to form an administration, Labouchère expected to be rewarded with a cabinet post. Queen Victoria refused to allow Gladstone to offer either Labouchère or Charles Dilke an office, however, as she had a strong personal dislike of them – &quot;she would &quot;never&quot; allow such horrid men to enter the Govt&quot;. Her dislike stemmed from his editorship of &quot;Truth&quot;, which she felt had insulted the Royal Family. According to the historian Vernon Bogdanor, this was the last time a British monarch vetoed a prime minister&#x27;s appointment of a cabinet minister. However, Gladstone may have been happy to drop Labouchère given his lack of political support. Likewise, the new foreign secretary, Lord Rosebery, a personal enemy of Labouchère, declined to offer him the ambassadorship to Washington for which Labouchère had asked.
Through the 1890s, Labouchère was a critic of both Liberal and Conservative Imperial policies; he demanded an enquiry into Rhodesian policy in 1893–94, and in 1895 sat on the commission enquiring into the Jameson Raid. However, his position became gradually alienated from his party and from public opinion, as he strongly opposed the South African War and argued for peace. His reputation was also tarnished by a series of financial scandals: in 1897, he was accused in the press of share-rigging, using &quot;Truth&quot; to disparage companies, advising shareholders to dispose of their shares and, when the share prices fell as a result, buying them himself at a low price. He failed to reply to the accusations, and his reputation suffered. A later pamphlet by Henry Hess of &quot;The Critic&quot;, in 1905, revealed further financial misdealings.

==Retirement==
When the Liberal party took power in December 1905, Labouchère was not offered any political office by Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the new prime minister. He was disappointed in this – he had been a strong supporter of Campbell-Bannerman – and retired from Parliament the following month, choosing not to stand at the 1906 general election. His only political reward from the new government was a privy councillorship.

He retired to Florence, Italy, where he died seven years later, leaving a fortune of half a million pounds sterling to his daughter Dora, who was by then married to Carlo, Marchese di Rudini.

<doc id="972915" wikidata="Q302694" url="?curid=972915" title="Vice-President of Fiji">
<text>The position of the vice-president of the Republic of Fiji was created in 1990, to provide a constitutional successor to the president of Fiji, in the event of the latter&#x27;s death or resignation, or of his otherwise being unable to carry out his duties. The vice-president&#x27;s role in government was mostly ceremonial as its sole purpose was to replace the president in his absence, death, or inability to hold office. The vice-presidency was abolished in 2013, with the powers of the office transferred to the Chief Justice of Fiji, who has a dormant commission which is triggered when the position of President of Fiji is either vacant or when the President is either absent or ill.

==History of the office==

Under the terms the 1990 Constitution of Fiji, the vice-presidency was divided between two persons, styled First Vice-President and Second Vice-President, respectively, but a single person held the office of vice-president from 1999, when the 1997 Constitution of Fiji came into effect.

Under the terms of the 1997 Constitution, the vice-president was appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs, after consultation with the prime minister. In April 2009, however, the Constitution was suspended, following the earlier suspension of the Great Council of Chiefs in April 2007. Six days after the suspension of the Constitution, the government issued a decree stating that the vice-president would henceforth be appointed by the president. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau was appointed vice-president the following day.

Under the terms of the 2013 Constitution, the vice-presidency was abolished, with its duties and powers transferred to the chief justice.

Being appointees of the all-indigenous Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji&#x27;s vice-presidents, like its presidents, have all been indigenous Fijians (of chiefly rank). In 2007, Reverend Akuila Yabaki, Director of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, suggested that &quot;the time may be right now to allow a person from any race to take up this position&quot;.

<doc id="972917" wikidata="Q74687" url="?curid=972917" title="Bulgarian National Bank">
<text>The Bulgarian National Bank (, , BNB) is the central bank of the Republic of Bulgaria. It has also been Bulgaria&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision since 2020.

Headquartered in Sofia, the bank was established in 1879. It is the 13th-oldest continuously existing central bank in the world. The bank has a key role in the Bulgarian economy. An independent institution responsible for issuing all banknotes and coins in the country, BNB is tasked with safekeeping the government&#x27;s currency reserves. It is also the sole owner of the Bulgarian Mint. Since 1 October 2007, it has been a member of the European System of Central Banks. The governor of the BNB is a member of the General Assembly of the European Central Bank.

==History==

===Establishment and early development===
On 25 January 1879, the Russian Imperial Commissar in Bulgaria, Knyaz Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov, approved the Charter of the Bulgarian National Bank. On 4 April 1879, the first BNB Governor was appointed, on 23 May the Bank was officially opened, and on 6 June it carried out its first banking operation. The Law on the right to mint coins in the Principality was passed in 1880, and it instituted the Bulgarian national currency, the Lev. The following year, Bulgaria minted its first coins of 2, 5 and 10 stotinki.

Initially, the BNB was a state-owned central bank, subject to the oversight of the Minister of Finance, which serviced the state budget and the cash activities of the Government and carried out banking transactions typical of a commercial bank, without having the right to print or introduce banknotes into circulation. The Law on the foundation of the BNB and the new Charter, both passed in 1885, reorganised the Bank, granting it monopoly of note issue. Later in the same year, the Bank issued the first Bulgarian banknotes.

===War period (1912–1918) and aftermath===

By the outbreak of the Balkan War (1912), the BNB gained much experience as a bank of issue and strengthened its independence. Apart from being the major lending centre in Bulgaria, it became the regulator of the monetary system, clearing the cash circulation of foreign coins and coping with the serious money crisis in Bulgaria in the late 19th century and with the consequences of the European money crisis in the early years of the 20th century.

During the wars (1912–1918) the BNB was forced to almost limitlessly lend to the Government and increase the note issue and the amount of notes in circulation. The Bulgarian Lev came out of the wars strongly depreciated, and during the decade afterward the Bank made efforts to restore its value. 

===Interwar stabilization and World War II===

In 1928, Bulgaria was granted a large &quot;Stabilisation Loan&quot; coordinated by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations. This was intended to stabilize the Lev, to reinforce the capital stock of the BNB, and to liquidate the Government&#x27;s debt to the Bank. Two new laws were passed for the same purpose – the Law on the BNB, which made the most profound institutional changes to the Bank (it became a real central bank of issue free of any activities untypical of this type of bank), and the Law on the stabilisation of the Lev and on coinage, which established a gold standard in Bulgaria whereby 92 Leva equalled 1 gram of pure gold. 

All these steps supported the Bank&#x27;s business during the years of the Great Depression (1929–1933). From the mid-1930s till Bulgaria entered the Second World War in 1941 the BNB went through a revival. At that time, the building of the Bank was constructed, which houses it to the present day.

During the Second World War, the BNB was compelled again to lend to the Government and deal with the depreciation of the Lev. 

===Communist era===

The 1947 Law on Banks carried out a drastic reform: private banks were nationalized and the banking system was transformed on the Soviet model, and thus operated until the late 1980s. The BNB was entrusted to provide all financial services to the newly created overcentralized planned economy. The Bank too was obliged to directly lend to the Government and the economy, being directly subordinated to the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Finance.

In 1952, the Bulgarian Mint was set up and it started minting circulation and commemorative coins.

===Since 1990===

The return of the Bulgarian banking system to the market economy principles and of the BNB to the independent central bank principles became possible only in 1991 when two basic laws came into effect – the Commerce Law, which brought back the legal foundations of commercial banking, and the new Law on the BNB, which restored the Bank&#x27;s autonomy and gave it the responsibility for supervising banks. In 1997 another Law on the BNB superseded the previous one; it reorganized the monetary system, and from 1 July a currency board arrangement was put in place. At first, the Bulgarian Lev was pegged to the Deutsche Mark, and from 1999 – to the Euro, at the rate of 1.95583 Leva for 1 Euro. Later in the same year the Bulgarian Lev was re-denominated.

In 1998, the BNB Printing Works was opened for business, and it began the production of banknotes and bonds with a very high level of security.

In 2005, amendments were made to the Law on the BNB, which ensured the institutional, functional, financial and personal independence of the BNB, changed the core purpose of the Bank, and expressly prohibited the central bank from providing funding to public institutions.

On 1 January 2007, Bulgaria joined the European Union, and ever since the BNB has been a member of the European System of Central Banks.

==Operations==

The bank is organized into three departments:
* Issue Department, responsible for maintaining the full foreign exchange coverage of the total amount of monetary liabilities, i.e. the issuance of national currency
* Banking Department, which, in case of systemic risk, acts as the lender of last resort. It also administers the currency board, introduced in Bulgaria in 1997
* Supervision Department, which oversees the country&#x27;s banking system.

==Head office building==

The Bulgarian National Bank&#x27;s headquarters in Sofia are located on the central Battenberg Square. The current edifice was commissioned to renowned architects Ivan Vasilyov and Dimitar Tsolov and built between 1934 and 1939 in the non-decorative Neoclassical style of the time. It spreads over an area of 3,700 m2 and has four overground and three underground storeys. Its interior is the work of Ivan Penkov and Dechko Uzunov.

<text>Vehicle size classes are series of ratings assigned to different segments of automotive vehicles for the purposes of vehicle emissions control and fuel economy calculation. Various methods are used to classify vehicles; in North America, passenger vehicles are classified by total interior capacity while trucks are classified by gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Vehicle segments in the European Union use linear measurements to describe size. Asian vehicle classifications are a combination of dimensions and engine displacement.

==North America==
===United States===

Vehicle classifications of four government agencies are in use in the United States: the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA as part of their NCAP program), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the U.S. Census Bureau. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also has its own vehicle classification system that is used by most vehicle insurance companies in the U.S.

====EPA====
EPA size classes are defined in Federal Regulation, Title 40—Protection of Environment, Section 600.315-08 &quot;Classes of comparable automobiles&quot;. This information is repeated in the Fuel Economy Guide. Passenger car classes are defined based on interior volume index (the combined passenger and cargo volume) and are as follows.

Trucks classes are defined by gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The administrator classifies light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) into the following classes: Small pickup trucks, standard pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and SUVs. Starting in the 2013 model year, SUVs are divided between small sport utility vehicles and standard sport utility vehicles. Pickup trucks and SUVs are separated by car line on the basis of gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). For a product line with more than one GVWR, the characteristic GVWR value for the product line is established by calculating the arithmetic average of all distinct GVWR values less than or equal to 8,500 pounds available for that product line.

Special purpose vehicles. All automobiles with GVWR less than or equal to 8,500 pounds and all medium-duty passenger vehicles which possess special features and which the administrator determines are more appropriately classified separately from typical automobiles.

====NHTSA====
Unlike the EPA, which groups automobiles by interior volume, the NHTSA groups cars for NCAP testing by weight class.

====FHWA====
Developed in the 1980s, the Federal Highway Administration 13-category classification rule set is currently used for most federal reporting requirements and that serves as the basis for most state vehicle classification systems.


====U.S. Census Bureau====
The Census Bureau surveys the United States truck population. Large truck owners (NHTSA classes 4-13) are given a standard survey, and small truck (pickups, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles) owners (NHTSA class 3) are given a short survey. In the United States the government agencies consider all pickups, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles to be trucks for regulatory purposes, no matter what construction method is used, either unibody or body on frame. Coupe utilities are considered pickup trucks in the U.S., not cars. SUVs are always considered trucks, although there are some CUVs with low ground clearance which are considered station wagon or hatchback cars for regulatory purposes.

====IIHS====
The Insurance Institute has its own crash test program and groups cars by curb weight and shadow into six classes, micro, mini, small, midsize, large and very large.

===Canada===
Cars are divided into six classes based on interior volume, as shown in the table below. These classes are not defined in Canadian regulations, but by the &quot;Fuel Consumption Guide&quot; published by Natural Resources Canada. An interior volume index is calculated from the combined passenger and trunk or cargo space. Pickup trucks, special purpose vehicles and vans are segmented in their own respective classes. As most Canadian cars share designs with American cars, Canada&#x27;s classifications closely mirror those of the United States.

Vehicle classes for trucks are listed in On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations (SOR/2003-2), published in &quot;Canada Gazette Part 2, Vol. 137 No. 1&quot;.

Medium-duty passenger vehicle is classified as a heavy-duty vehicle that is designed primarily for the transportation of up to 12 people.

A motorcycle is classified as an on-road vehicle with a headlight, taillight and stoplight that has two or three wheels and a curb weight of 793 kg or less, but does not include a vehicle that has an engine displacement of less than 50 cc, or that, with an 80 kg (176 pound) driver:
* Cannot start from a dead stop using only the engine
* Cannot exceed a speed of 40 km/h on a level paved surface

==Europe==
=== EEC ===
Vehicle segments in Europe do not have formal characterization or regulations. Models segments tend to be based on comparison to well-known brand models. For example, a car such as the Volkswagen Golf might be described as being in the Ford Focus size class, or vice versa. The VW Polo is smaller, so it belongs one segment below the Golf, while the bigger Passat is one segment above.

The names of the segments were mentioned, but not defined, in 1999 in an EU document titled &quot;Case No COMP/M.1406 Hyundai / Kia Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 Merger Procedure&quot;.
* A: mini cars
* B: small cars
* C: medium cars
* D: large cars
* E: executive cars
* F: luxury cars 
* J: sport utility cars (including off-road vehicles)
* M: Multi purpose cars
* S: Sports cars

=== EuroNCAP ===
EuroNCAP applies a standard safety test to all new cars, the results are listed in separate categories to allow prospective vehicle purchasers to compare models of a similar size and shape:
* Small family cars (also for stand-alone saloon superminis, like the Dacia Logan)
* Large family cars (includes compact executive cars)
* Executive cars (for expensive cars over 4.80 m long)
* Roadsters
* Small off-roaders (similar to the North American crossover SUV category)
* Large off-roaders (similar to the North American SUV category)
* Small MPVs (both mini MPVs and compact MPVs)
* Large MPVs

==Asia==

===China===
Vehicle size categories for passenger vehicles for the China NCAP program as defined by the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) may appear similar to the European system, but are closer to the Japanese in application.
* &quot;Category A&quot; (A-segment) vehicles are two-box vehicles of between 4 and 4.5 meters in length, &quot;or&quot; three-box vehicles (i.e., sedans with trunks) with engines of less than 1600 cc.
* &quot;Category B&quot; (B-segment) vehicles are longer than 4.5 m in length with engines of over 1600 cc.
* &quot;Multi-purpose vehicles&quot;, or MPVs
* &quot;Sport utility vehicles&quot; or SUVs

===India===
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) divides Indian passenger vehicles into the segments A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, B1, B2 and SUV. The classification is done solely based on the length of the vehicle. The details of the segments are below:

=== Japan ===
Vehicle size classes in Japan are rather simple compared to other regions. The classifications were established under the Japanese Government&#x27;s Road Vehicle Act of 1951. There are just three different classes defined by regulations. The dimension regulations are enforced to exact measurements. These standards of classification are enforced on all vehicles within the jurisdiction of Japan, and no special consideration is made for the vehicles&#x27; origination of manufacture. The Japanese law regulates all vehicles that do not travel on railroads (traditional or maglev), or are not powered by physically contacting overhead power lines. The law regulates vehicles that are powered by an autonomous power source. Smaller cars are more popular in Japan due to the confined driving conditions and speed limits.
* &quot;Keijidosha&quot; (light cars): Buyers of &quot;Kei&quot; cars enjoy a number of tax, registration and other benefits to encourage the purchase of these tiny vehicles (among road vehicles requiring a license only). Regulations have been updated a number of times over the years to allow larger, more powerful cars to be developed and maintain demand as buyers become more affluent, and to improve collision protection performance. The current regulations state that a kei car is a vehicle less than long, wide, high, with a maximum engine displacement of and maximum power of . Extra small microcars are available with an engine size no larger than , identified with a light blue license plate and blue text.
* &quot;Small size Passenger vehicles&quot;, commonly called &quot;5 number&quot; vehicles in reference to their license-plate prefix. This class is defined as limited to vehicles less than long, wide, high and with engine displacement at or under . Vans, trucks and station wagons (considered commercial vehicles in Japan) in the compact size class receive a &quot;4 number&quot; license prefix. Before 1989, the annual tax rate of normal-size class was more than doubled of this class so that most Japanese cars were built within small-size class requirement. Now the annual tax rate only varies with engine displacement however useful small-size class cars are still popular in Japanese market, and Japanese manufacturers make regular improvements to compact sized products to maximize interior accommodation while remaining within the exterior boundaries.
* &quot;Normal-size passenger vehicles&quot;, commonly called &quot;3 number&quot; in reference to their license-plate prefix (trucks and buses over 2000 cc have license plates numbers beginning with &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; respectively), are those more than long, wide, high or with engine displacement larger than . This regulation also mandates that passenger vehicles for private use may not exceed length or width. Based on market conditions, vehicles such as the first generation Honda Legend (shorter and narrower V6Gi and V6Zi variants with a 2.0 V6 engine), and the Mitsubishi Starion were produced in both &quot;compact size&quot; (&quot;just&quot; under 4.7 m long and 1.7 m wide) for the Japanese market, and longer or wider &quot;passenger size&quot; versions, primarily for export.

Motorcycles also have classification definitions based on engine size:
; Class I moped : Engine size must be at or less than 50 cc, identified by blue text and white extra small license plate.
; Class II moped (B) : Engine size is between 50–90 cc, identified by blue text and yellow extra small license plate.
; Class II moped (MIG) : Engine size is between 90–125 cc, identified by blue text and pink extra small license plate (colour of plate can vary according to regional requirements)
; Motorcycle light : Engine size is between 125–250 cc, identified by green text and white small license plate.
; Motorcycle medium : Engine size is between 250–400 cc, identified by green outline and green text with white small license plate.
; Motorcycle large : Engine size is over 400 cc, identified by green outline and green text with white small license plate.

All vehicles with an engine displacement over 250 cc are required to undergo an inspection (called &quot;Shaken&quot; in Japan). Vehicle weight tax and mandatory vehicle insurance are usually paid at this time. This is separate from the road tax paid yearly. The road tax varies from for kei cars up to for normal size cars with 4.6L engines.

==Oceania==

===Australia===

SUV (includes crossover SUVs) size, exterior vehicle length (excluding rear mounted spare wheel/tyre) multiplied by exterior vehicle width (excluding mirrors), both in millimetres.

*Small/Light SUV: less than 
*Medium SUV: 
*Large SUV: 
*Upper/Extra large SUV: more than

<text>Herbert Leon &quot;Sonny&quot; Callahan (September 11, 1932 – June 25, 2021) was an American businessman and politician from Alabama. After being elected as a Democrat from Mobile to the state house and senate, he shifted to the Republican Party after losing a race for Lieutenant Governor of Alabama in 1982. He was repeatedly elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1985 to 2003. Afterward he established his own lobbying firm and continued to be active in the Republican Party.

==Early life and education==
Callahan was born in Mobile, Alabama, in 1932 to a large Irish Catholic family. He had eight brothers and sisters. After attending public schools, he attended classes at the University of Alabama, Mobile campus. He left college before graduation, serving in the United States Navy from 1952 to 1954.

==Work and politics==

Afterward Callahan returned to Mobile, where he started work in the trucking and warehousing businesses. He joined the Democratic Party and became active. He ran and was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1970; in 1978 he was elected to the Alabama Senate for the 34th district.

When he left the state House and the state Senate, he was succeeded each time by Ann Bedsole, a Mobile businesswoman, philanthropist, and a moderate Republican. In 1982, Callahan lost a Democratic bid to become lieutenant governor of the state.

During this period since the social changes of the 1960s, which resulted in African Americans regaining their ability to exercise their franchise in southern states, many white former Democrats in the South were shifting to the Republican Party. However, conservative Democrats like Callahan continued to do well at the state level in the Mobile area.

When 10-term Republican congressman Jack Edwards decided not to run for re-election in 1984, Callahan was heavily wooed by both parties to run for the seat. He ultimately decided to run as a Republican. Callahan won by 4,000 votes, mostly on the strength of a 6,000-vote margin in the heavily Republican Baldwin County. Callahan was also undoubtedly helped by the presence of the popular President Ronald Reagan atop the ticket that year for his second term; Reagan carried the 1st district with more than 60 percent of the vote. To date, 1984 is the only time the Democrats have come close to retaking the 1st congressional district since Edwards won it for the Republicans in 1964.

Callahan would never face another contest nearly that close. He was unopposed for reelection in 1986, a year that was far more difficult for Republicans at the national level. He easily defeated underfunded Democratic challengers for the House seat in 1988, 1992, 1994, and 1996. He ran unopposed in 1990 and 1998, and faced only a Libertarian challenger in 2000. The Democrats have never come reasonably close to winning the seat since Callahan&#x27;s initial run; indeed, the 1984 contest is the only time since the GOP began its current run in the seat that a Democrat has managed even 40 percent of the vote. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold a number of state and local offices in the district well into the 1990s.

When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, Callahan became the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs. Callahan had voted against numerous foreign aid bills before taking the chairmanship, and he remained skeptical of foreign aid. In 1998 it became known that Callahan was speaking by phone with President Bill Clinton during one of the President&#x27;s first sexual encounters with aide Monica Lewinsky. In 2001, Callahan became the chairman of the Energy and Water Development subcommittee.

Callahan retired from the House in 2003. His chief of staff, Jo Bonner, won the election to replace Callahan, receiving huge support from both Callahan and Edwards.

After leaving Congress, Callahan founded Sonny Callahan and Associates, a lobbying firm that he headed. He served as campaign chairman for businessman Tim James&#x27; unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for Governor of Alabama. Callahan also joined Dawson &amp; Associates in Washington, D.C., as an advisor on federal budget and permitting matters.

==Steve Russo scandal==
In the Summer of 2004, Callahan wrote a letter to State Lands Director James Hillman Griggs, complaining that Federal Coastal Zone Management pass-through grant money, which had been entrusted to the City of Orange Beach for beach development, was not going to the intended recipients. Griggs&#x27; office investigated and cancelled the grant and additional funding requested by Orange Beach Mayor Steve Russo and City Attorney Larry Sutley. The United States Department of Justice initiated an investigation and indicted the two officials as well as developer Ken Wall. In 2006, Russo, Sutley, and Wall were convicted of corruption and obstruction of justice related to a scheme to &quot;enrich the mayor in exchange for favorable treatment [of developers] on large construction projects in the city.&quot;

==Death==
Callahan died on June 25, 2021, at the age of 88.

<doc id="972928" wikidata="Q4010528" url="?curid=972928" title="Mid-size car">
<text>Mid-size—also known as intermediate—is a vehicle size class which originated in the United States and is used for cars larger than compact cars and smaller than full-size cars. &quot;Large family car&quot; is a UK term and a part of the D-segment in the European car classification. Mid-size cars are manufactured in a variety of body styles, including sedans, coupes, station wagons, hatchbacks, and convertibles. Compact executive cars can also fall under the mid-size category.

== History ==

The automobile that defined this size in the United States was the Rambler Six that was introduced in 1956, although it was called a &quot;compact&quot; car at that time. Much smaller than any standard contemporary full-size cars, it was called a compact to distinguish it from the small imported cars that were being introduced into the marketplace.

By the early 1960s, the car was renamed the Rambler Classic and while it retained its basic dimensions, it was now competing with an array of new &quot;intermediate&quot; models from General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. The introduction of the 1962 Ford Fairlane was viewed by consumers as too close to the compact Falcon in size and performance as well as too close to the full-sized Ford models in price. It was the introduction of General Motors &quot;senior compacts&quot; that grew the mid-size market segment as the line of cars themselves kept increasing in size. By 1965, these GM &quot;A platform&quot; mid-size models matched the size of 1955 full-size cars.

During the 1970s, the intermediate class in the U.S. was generally defined as vehicles with wheelbases between and . Once again, the cars grew and by 1974 they were &quot;about as large as the full-size cars of a decade or so ago ... best sellers include Ford Torino, Chevrolet Chevelle, AMC Matador, Plymouth Satellite ...&quot; The domestic manufacturers began changing the definition of &quot;medium&quot; as they developed new models for an evolving market place.

A turning point occurred in the late 1970s, when rising fuel costs and government fuel economy regulations caused all car classes to shrink, and in many cases to blur. Automakers moved previously &quot;full-size&quot; nameplates to smaller platforms such as the Ford LTD II and the Plymouth Fury. A comparison test by &quot;Popular Science&quot; of four intermediate sedans (the 1976 AMC Matador, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Torino, and Dodge Coronet) predicted that these will be the &quot;big cars of the future.&quot; By 1978, General Motors made its intermediate models smaller.

New &quot;official&quot; size designations in the U.S. were introduced by the EPA, which defined market segments by passenger and cargo space. Formerly mid-sized cars that were built on the same platform, like the AMC Matador sedan, had a combined passenger and cargo volume of , and were now considered &quot;full-size&quot; automobiles.

Cars that defined the mid-size market in the 1980s and 1990s included the Chrysler K-Cars (Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant), the Ford Taurus, and the Toyota Camry, which was upsized into the midsize class in 1991. The Taurus and Camry came to define the mid-size market for decades.

Mid-size cars were the most popular category of cars sold in the United States, with 27.4 percent during the first half of 2012, ahead of crossovers at 19 percent.

== Current definition ==

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &quot;Fuel Economy Regulations for 1977 and Later Model Year&quot; (dated July 1996) includes definitions for classes of automobiles. Based on the combined passenger and cargo volume, mid-size cars are defined as having an &quot;interior volume index&quot; of .

<text>Full-size car—also known as large car—is a vehicle size class which originated in the United States and is used for cars larger than mid-size cars. It is the largest size class for cars. In the United Kingdom, this class is referred to as the executive car, while in Europe, it is known as E-segment or F-segment.

== Current definition ==
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &quot;Fuel Economy Regulations for 1977 and Later Model Year&quot; (dated July 1996) includes definitions for classes of automobiles. Based on the combined passenger and cargo volume, &quot;large cars&quot; (full-size cars) are defined as having an &quot;interior volume index&quot; of more than for sedan models, or for station wagons.

==Engines==
From the introduction of the Ford Flathead V8 in the 1930s until the 1980s, most North American full-size cars were powered by V8 engines. However, V6 engines and straight-six engines have also been available on American full-size cars, especially until the 1950s, and have become increasingly common since the downsizing of full-sized cars in the 1980s.

== History ==
=== Early 20th century ===
The lineage of mass-produced full-size American cars begins with the 1908 Ford Model T. In 1923, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Superior, becoming the first vehicle to adopt a common chassis (the A-body) for several brands. Compared to the cars of the 21st century, these vehicles are small in length and width.

From the 1920s to the 1950s, most manufacturers produced model lines in a single size, growing in size with each model redesign. While the length and wheelbase varied between model lines, width was a relatively constant dimension, as the American federal government required the addition of clearance lights on a width past 80 inches.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, following the introduction of compact cars (such as the Chevrolet Corvair, Ford Falcon and Plymouth Valiant), the &quot;full-size car&quot; designation came into wider use. In the 1960s, the term was applied to the traditional car lines of lower-price brands, including Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth. As a relative term, full-size cars were marketed by the same brands offering compact cars, with entry-level cars for buyers seeking the roominess of a luxury car at a lower cost. Into the 1970s, the same vehicles could transport up to six occupants comfortably (or eight in a station wagon), at the expense of high fuel consumption.
=== 1970s ===
The sales of full-size vehicles in the United States declined after the early 1970s fuel crisis. In response to the 1978 implementation of CAFE, American manufacturers implemented downsizing to improve fuel economy, with full-size vehicles as the first model lines to see major change.

While General Motors and Ford would reduce the exterior footprint of their full-size lines to that of their intermediates, AMC withdrew its Ambassador and Matador full-size lines (to concentrate on production of mid-size vehicles). To save production costs, Chrysler repackaged its intermediates using the erstwhile full-size names, moving on to exiting the segment in 1981.

=== 1980s ===
During the 1980s, manufacturers further reduced the exterior footprint of several model lines from the full-size segment into the mid-size class to comply with more stringent CAFE standards. With the 1982 model year, Chrysler exited the full-size segment entirely, with the mid-size Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury serving as its largest sedan lines.

Following the 1985 model year, General Motors replaced most of its full-size rear-wheel-drive model lines with smaller front-wheel drive sedans on the H and C platforms. Only station wagons, the Chevrolet Caprice, and the Cadillac Brougham remained. Initially developed to replace the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, the 1986 Ford Taurus was produced alongside it as the Ford mid-size model line.

After largely abandoning the full-size segment for compact cars and minivans, Chrysler gained reentry into the full-size segment in 1988 with the Eagle Premier (also produced as the Dodge Monaco). Developed by AMC before its acquisition by Chrysler, the Premier was a version of the front-wheel drive Renault 25 adapted for North America. The Saab 9000 took a special position at the end of the 1980s, as for a long time it was the only imported car to be classified as a &quot;large car&quot; by the EPA.

=== 1990s ===
From the 1980s to the 1990s, the market share of full-size cars began to decline; along with the increased use of mid-size cars, vans, and SUVs grew in use as family vehicles. Between 1960 and 1994, the market share of full-size cars declined from 65 to only 8.3 percent. From 1990 until 1992, both GM and Ford redesigned its full-size car lines for the first time since the late 1970s.

For the 1992 model year, Chrysler introduced a new front-wheel drive full-size car line, replacing the Eagle Premier/Dodge Monaco with the Chrysler LH cars (Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler Concorde/New Yorker/LHS). The same year, the Buick Roadmaster was introduced, becoming the first rear-wheel drive GM model line adopted outside of Chevrolet and Cadillac since 1985; the Chevrolet Impala was returned for the 1994 model year.

The 1989 Lexus LS400 luxury sedan was the first Japanese full-size car sold in North America.

Following the 1996 model year, GM ended production of large rear-wheel drive sedans.

=== 2000s===
By 2000, with the sole exception of the Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car, full-size cars had abandoned rear-wheel drive and body-on-frame construction. Instead of model lineage, the EPA &quot;large car&quot; definition of over 120 interior cubic feet was widely used.

Initially developed for the midsize Oldsmobile Aurora, the GM G-body chassis was expanded into the full-size segment for Cadillac in 2000 (for the Deville, later the DTS) and adapted by Buick (the Lucerne) in 2006. For the 2005 model year, Chrysler replaced the LH cars with the LX cars (returning to rear-wheel drive). The same year, Ford introduced the Five Hundred, its first front-wheel drive full-size car (the first American full-size car offered with all-wheel drive); in 2008, the Five Hundred was renamed the Taurus.

=== 2010s===
After the 2011 model year, Ford ended production of the Panther platform, shifting to the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS; in 2017, the latter was replaced by the Lincoln Continental. In 2011, General Motors ended production of the G-body for several chassis (with Cadillac later shifting its largest sedans to rear-wheel drive). In 2012, the Tesla Model S became the first fully electric full-size car sold in North America. For the 2013 model year, the Chevrolet Impala became the final American-market full-size sedan sold with a front bench seat. 

By the mid-2010s, full-size cars began seeing a steep decline in sales in North America, with SUVs replacing much of the full-size segment. At the end of the decade, demand for sedans (of all sizes) shifted towards vehicles of other layouts, reducing or shuttering production of sedans entirely. In 2018, Ford announced the sales of all Ford-branded passenger cars (except for the Mustang) would end in North America by 2022. General Motors announced the closure of several manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada, with the production of the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse ending in 2020. As of 2022, full-size cars from Asian manufacturers include the Lexus LS, Genesis G80/G90, Nissan Maxima, and Toyota Avalon. Another car from an Asian manufacturer, the eighth-generation Hyundai Sonata, is classified by the EPA as full-size despite being marketed as a mid-size model.

In 2018, the three highest-selling cars in the full-size sedan category in the United States were the Dodge Charger, Chevrolet Impala, and Chrysler 300.

==== 2020s ====
The large car segment has been declining in the United States accounting for 3.6% of new vehicle sales in 2021, down from 6.6% in 2016. The models in this category included the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Nissan Maxima, and Toyota Avalon. They have been discontinued after the 2023 or 2024 model years. The trend in the large car market segment in United States is toward the SUV.

<doc id="972939" wikidata="Q1186227" url="?curid=972939" title="Democratic Party (Indonesia)">
<text>The Democratic Party (, ) is a centre to centre-right nationalist political party in Indonesia. Currently, it holds 44 seats in the House of Representatives (DPR). It is led by Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (AHY), the son of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), who served as the President of Indonesia from 2004 to 2014.

Founded in September 2001 as the political vehicle of SBY, the party gained its initial parliamentary representation following the 2004 legislative election, and SBY was elected as president. It then became one of the major parties in SBY&#x27;s governing coalition. In 2009, the party assumed power by winning the majority of votes in the legislative election and became the ruling and largest party in the DPR, with SBY re-elected for his second term. In 2014, the party performed poorly in the legislative election, losing half of its seats in the DPR and subsequently served as the opposition to the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration. In the 2020 party congress, AHY was elected as the chairman. In 2024, it joined the government coalition and AHY was appointed as the Minister of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning.

==History==
===Origins===
The 2001 Special Session of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) resulted in Megawati Sukarnoputri&#x27;s election as Indonesia&#x27;s president, creating a vice president vacancy. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), a candidate, lost to Hamzah Haz. Yudhoyono&#x27;s popularity, evident in his vice presidential bid, prompted supporter Vence Rumangkang to propose forming a party for the 2004 elections. Yudhoyono approved and delegated party formation to Rumangkang. SBY himself did not directly participate in the creation of the party, although his wife Ani Yudhoyono claimed a leadership position. The party was formed by intellectual and academic circles.

From 12 to 19 August 2001, Rumangkang, with Yudhoyono&#x27;s input, finalized the party&#x27;s outline. On 9 September 2001 (Yudhoyono&#x27;s 52nd birthday), the Democratic Party was declared, registered at the Ministry of Law and Human Rights on 10 September 2001, and Subur Budhisantoso was elected party chairman.

===2004–2014: The Yudhoyono administration and largest party status===
The party won 7.5% share of votes and won 57 out of 560 seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) in the 2004 legislative election and finished in fifth place overall. The party nominated Yudhoyono as its presidential candidate, with Jusuf Kalla as the vice presidential candidate. In this, they were also supported by the Crescent Star Party and Indonesian Justice and Unity Party. Yudhoyono and Kalla won the first round of elections in July 2004 with 33.6% of the votes and would go on to win 60.1% in the run-offs, thereby securing Yudhoyono&#x27;s election as president. In May 2005, the party held its first party congress, during which Hadi Utomo was elected as chairman. Nevertheless, the highest authority in the Party remained with Yudhoyono, who was elected was chairman of the Advisory Board (&quot;&quot;).

The party came first in the 2009 legislative election with 20.9 percent of the votes, making it the largest party in the DPR, with 148 seats, just over one quarter of the total. Yudhoyono won the election, with former governor of Bank Indonesia, Boediono, as vice presidential candidate, with a total tally of 60.8% in first round of runoff system election, beating former president Megawati and incumbent vice-president Kalla. After the resignation of Anas Urbaningrum, the party held an extraordinary congress on 30 March 2013 in Bali to fill the chairmanship. Yudhoyono ran unopposed and was unanimously elected after no other party members decided to run.

For the 2014 legislative election, the party set a target of 15% of the national vote, less than its 2009 share. One reason the party expected its vote to fall was that Yudhoyono would not able to run for president, having served the two terms allowed for in the constitution. However, the party won only 10.19%, losing over half of its seats in the legislature.

=== Post–2014: AHY chairmanship and internal conflict ===
For the 2019 legislative election, the party initially set a target of 15%, but later changed the target to 10% of the national vote. The party managed to gain 7.77% of the vote, losing some seats in the legislature. On 15 March 2020, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (AHY), who had previously commanded the Joint Task Command (Kogasma) during the 2019 general election, was elected as the new chairman, replacing his father.

On 5 March 2021, an unauthorized extraordinary congress in Deli Serdang convened by some party members elected Moeldoko as the new chairman, contrary to the 2020 congress that elected AHY as the chairman until 2025. Former chairman Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono opposed the congress, arguing it was unlawful, as neither the party&#x27;s high council nor majority of its regional branches had requested it. AHY claimed Moeldoko&#x27;s election was illegal, asserting himself as the legitimate party leader. On 31 March 2021, the government confirmed the extraordinary congress result as illegitimate, affirming AHY as the rightful chairman of the party. 

Entering the beginning of 2023, the Democratic Party through its decision chose to nominate Anies Baswedan to become a presidential candidate. Apart from that, the Democrats also nominated their general chairman, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, to be Anies&#x27; running mate. However shockingly, Anies selected Muhaimin Iskandar from the National Awakening Party (PKB) after the latter left Prabowo Subianto&#x27;s Advanced Indonesia Coalition. As the result of Muhaimin&#x27;s appointment as Anies&#x27; running mate, AHY and the Democratic Party withdrew their support and left their coalition. After their exit, the Democratic Party was approached by PDI-P who is hoping for AHY to back Ganjar Pranowo as Hasto Kristiyanto claimed intense communications are underway. The Democrats also got approached by the Advanced Indonesia Coalition as Prabowo held a meeting together with his father in Cikeas. After many considerations, on 21 September 2023 in Jakarta Convention Center, AHY and the Democratic Party declared to back Prabowo Subianto in his presidential campaign. Ironically, both AHY and Moeldoko supported the same candidate for the 2024 presidential election.

==Political identities==
===Ideology===
The 2008 Law on Political Parties states that political parties are allowed to include specific characteristics that reflect their political aspirations, as long as they do not contradict Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. As per Articles 2 and 3 of its constitution and bylaws (AD/ART), the Democratic Party is founded on Pancasila and &quot;nationalist-religious&quot; is its slogan. It views attempts to clash nationalism and religion as incorrect and misleading. Outsider views on the party&#x27;s political orientation vary. Academics and domestic observers classified it as a nationalist party, while their international counterparts described it as a secular-nationalist, conservative, or national-liberal party. Its political leaning has been described as centrist, centre-right, or catch-all party.

==Controversies==

=== Corruption Cases ===
Muhammad Nazaruddin was dismissed by the Democratic Party&#x27;s ethics council from his position as party treasurer in May 2011 due to his involvement in a corruption case, but he remained a legislator in the House of Representatives. Constitutional Court chief Mahfud MD said Nazaruddin had given S$120,000 ($96,900) to Constitutional Court secretary general Janedri M. Gaffar in 2010. The money was later returned to Nazaruddin. On 24 May 2011, Mahfud reported Nazaruddin to the Corruption Eradication Commission for allegedly trying to bribe a court official.

On 20 April 2012, Nazaruddin was convicted of corruption and sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison and fined approximately US$22,000. He was found guilty of accepting over 4.68 billion rupiah in return for helping rig the tenders for an athletes&#x27; village built for the Southeast Asian Games in South Sumatra in November 2011.

Nazaruddin was arrested by Interpol in Cartagena, Colombia in August 2011, having fled Indonesia after being named a suspect in the case.

The Nazaruddin scandal was followed by the naming of a number of high-ranking party officials and legislators as suspects in numerous graft cases. Most prominent among them was Youth and Sports Minister Andi Mallarangeng, who resigned in December 2012. Mallarangeng was named suspect in the same athlete training camp case which had involved Nazaruddin. Business tycoon Siti Hartati Murdaya, who had served on the party&#x27;s Advisory Board, resigned in August 2012 after becoming embroiled in a corruption case for which she was later jailed.

=== #ShameOnYouSBY ===
In 2014, the emergence of the hashtag #ShameOnYouSBY and several other hashtags on Twitter attacking the President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Democratic Party occurred due to the walk out of most members of the Democratic Party faction during the plenary session for the ratification of the Regional Election Law which resulted in the election of regional heads such as governors, regents and mayor by the Regional Representative Council. It was later revealed that there was a miscommunication between the President and his party fraction as the parliamentary leader of the Democratic Party, Nurhayati Ali Assegaf misread the President&#x27;s message from &quot;all out&quot; to &quot;walk out&quot;.

<text>Millennium is a 1989 science fiction drama film directed by Michael Anderson and starring Kris Kristofferson, Cheryl Ladd, Robert Joy, Brent Carver, Al Waxman and Daniel J. Travanti.

The film follows an air crash investigator who discovers curiously strange details while investigating a recent crash. A woman is sent back to his time from the future to try and derail his investigation before he uncovers their secret.

&quot;Millennium&quot; is based on the 1977 short story &quot;Air Raid&quot; by John Varley. Varley started work on a screenplay in 1979, and released the expanded story in book-length form in 1983 as &quot;Millennium&quot;.

== Plot ==
In 1989, while on its landing approach, a commercial airliner is about to be struck by another plane from above. The pilot struggles to control the plane while the flight engineer checks the passenger cabin. He returns to the cockpit yelling that everyone is dead and the corpses are burned.

National Transportation Safety Board investigator Bill Smith investigates the accident. He and his team are confused by the flight engineer&#x27;s words on the cockpit voice recorder, as there is no evidence of a fire before the crash. Meanwhile, theoretical physicist Dr. Arnold Mayer is also curious about the crash, which borders on science fiction. In a lecture, he discusses the possibility of visits from time travelers.

About one-thousand years into the future, pollution has rendered humans unable to reproduce. Teams are sent into the past to abduct people who are about to be killed; the plane crashes were part of this plan. The abductees are kept in stasis until they can be sent into the far future to repopulate the Earth. Most of the current population is in poor health but the time travelers—mostly women—are relatively healthy and are given the best food and care to pass for 20th-century humans. Present-day air is too clean for the time travelers to process; they smoke cigarettes to mimic their own timeline&#x27;s atmosphere.

Every incursion into the past causes an accompanying &quot;timequake&quot;, with a magnitude proportional to the incursion&#x27;s effects. Time travelers try to minimize their effects by replacing the humans they abduct with organically grown copies. This explains the flight engineer&#x27;s comment about the charred passengers; the replicas had been pre-burned in preparation for the crash.

In 1963, a time traveler on a plane is shot before it crashes, losing a stun weapon as a result. This weapon winds up in Dr. Mayer&#x27;s possession, setting his path to investigate what is happening. Twenty-five years later, Smith finds a similar artifact among the wreckage of the crash portrayed at the beginning of the film.

Worried that the discoveries made by Smith and Mayer might change history, time-traveler Louise Baltimore is sent back to 1989 to deter Smith from pursuing his investigation. She gains Smith&#x27;s trust and seduces him into a one-night stand, attempting to distract him. Smith gradually becomes suspicious and visits Dr. Mayer. Louise materializes from the future and reveals her mission to them, hoping they will voluntarily keep the secret. During the conversation, Mayer dies while reassembling the stun weapon.

Mayer was instrumental in the development of the Gate technology that made time travel possible; his death results in an unsolvable paradox—a &quot;force infinity&quot; timequake—which will destroy the entire civilization of the future timeline. The only course of action is to send all the people who were collected into the distant future before the Gate is permanently destroyed.

Bill and Louise, who is pregnant, step through the Gate together and disappear. As an explosion destroys the Gate and as the blast wave engulfs Louise&#x27;s android advisor, Sherman, he quotes Winston Churchill: &quot;This is not the end. This is not the beginning of the end. It is the end of the beginning.&quot;

== Production ==
&quot;Millennium&quot; took a decade to reach the screen. One director initially attached was visual effects designer Douglas Trumbull; Paul Newman and Jane Fonda were proposed to play the leads. MGM was attached to make the film; they also had Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Brainstorm&quot; in production at the time. The death of &quot;Brainstorm&quot;″s leading lady Natalie Wood led to MGM briefly pulling the plug and thus halted production on &quot;Millennium&quot; due to Trumbull&#x27;s involvement. The role of director then passed to Richard Rush, Alvin Rakoff, and Phillip Borsos, before Michael Anderson, best known for 1956&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, stepped in. &quot;Millennium&quot;″s production designer, Gene Rudolf, had to produce a future setting that implied putrefaction and atrophy.

The largest set was the time-travel center for Louise Baltimore&#x27;s operation. Rudolf created rusted catwalks that traversed a large open space. Buildings crumbled and exposed their infrastructures. The walls were painted dull green, black and coppery. Rudolf wanted the future to look dirty, sick and poisoned.

Several scenes are set in the vault for the decrepit council members overseeing the time travel operation. Rudolf designed their chamber as a semicircle of seven transparent, upright cylinders, each serving as a life-support device. Four of the cylinders held actors. The others were filled with bodily organ props and medical equipment that served as the last still living remnants of these members.

To create the time-travel effects of the Gate itself, cinematographer René Ohashi produced the ghostly shimmering lights by spinning metal wheels covered in Mylar.

Since actual aircraft could not be sent through the set, miniature models and a full-size mock-up of the tail-section of a Boeing 707 were used. Optical effects were used to make the planes look as if they were entering the set.

The penultimate scene took place in a contemporary American home. Rudolf&#x27;s set was dominated by large horizontal windows. The room was filled with clocks, hourglasses and navigational equipment, in line with Dr. Mayer&#x27;s fascination with time travel.

The scenes shot in the airport terminal buildings were actually shot at Toronto Lester B. Pearson International Airport, in the former Terminals 1 &amp; 2. For the outdoor shot where Louise Baltimore steals the car, two-way traffic was run in front of the Terminal 2 arrivals level where it is ordinarily a one-way road.

Actor Scott Thompson played a bit part in the film, and discussed the experience in a sketch on &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; while in character as Buddy Cole.

==Reception==
As of January 31, 2018, the film holds an 11% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

== Alternate endings ==

The original North American theatrical and VHS release of the film features a close-up of Sherman as the gate explodes, followed by a shot of the sun rising over clouds.
The International theatrical release features a much wider shot of the gate&#x27;s explosion, followed by a wormhole/time portal effect. The scene then dissolves into an underwater shot of the two main characters swimming from above, followed by a view of the characters in a nude, Eden-esque embrace.

The 1999 North American DVD release contains the International version of the ending. The simpler North American version can also be found on the DVD as a bonus feature on the last page of the Production Notes; the version of the movie available on Netflix uses the North American ending as well.

== Home media ==
In February 2016, the film was released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory in a double feature with &quot;R.O.T.O.R.&quot;

<text>Norman McFarlane is a Canadian businessman and politician. He was the 64th Mayor of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. He was first elected on May 10, 2004, and sworn into office on Tuesday, May 25. He was defeated in the 2008 New Brunswick municipal elections by Ivan Court.

Born in Apohaqui, New Brunswick, McFarlane worked for Royal Insurance in Saint John from 1953 to 1993, retiring as Branch Manager. Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges.

McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc.

McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary&#x27;s key backers was Abel LeBlanc.

McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.

<doc id="972955" wikidata="Q2166341" url="?curid=972955" title="Single-speed bicycle">
<text>A single-speed bicycle is a type of bicycle with a single gear ratio. These bicycles are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle.

There are many types of modern single speed bicycles; BMX bicycles, most bicycles designed for children, cruiser type bicycles, classic commuter bicycles, unicycles, bicycles designed for track racing, fixed-gear road bicycles, and single-speed mountain and cyclocross bikes. 

Although most fixed-gear bicycles (fixies) are technically single speed, the term single-speed
generally refers to a single gear ratio bicycle with a freewheel mechanism to allow it to coast.

==Vis-à-vis multi-speed bicycles==
===Advantages===
A single-speed bicycle is generally cheaper, lighter, and mechanically simpler than its multi-geared equivalent. Without derailleurs or other gearing systems, there are fewer parts on the bicycle that require maintenance, making this type of cycle useful for city commuting in all weather. The drivetrain efficiency of a single-speed can be greater than today&#x27;s typical multi-geared bicycles. A straight chainline, lack of chain drag from rear derailleur jockey pulleys, and lack of chainrings, ramps and pins all improve efficiency. As a single rear cog takes less space than the typical seven to twelve cogs present on most multi-geared rear cassettes, rear wheels can be built with little or no dish.

===Disadvantages===
As the single-speed bicycle lacks alternative gearing ratios, it is less versatile, as it cannot be pedaled efficiently outside of its single gearing range. Without lower gearing options, the single speed bicycle is generally more difficult to pedal uphill. Conversely, its dedicated gear ratio also limits top speed, and is slower than a multi-geared bicycle on flat or descending terrain once bicycle speed exceeds the rider&#x27;s ability to maintain continuing increases in &quot;cadence&quot; (pedaling revolutions per minute), typically 85–110 rpm. Compared to a fixed-gear bicycle, a singlespeed is easier to ride downhill and around corners (the inside pedal can be kept up to avoid grounding). However, it does not help the rider pedal around the dead centres like a fixed gear, nor does it allow the fine speed control or easy trackstands that a fixed gear permits. The pawls of a dirty and unmaintained freewheel can also clog, leaving the rider with no drive; this is impossible on a &quot;fixie&quot;.

==Types of single-speed bicycles==

While track bicycles are always single speed, mountain bicycles, road bicycles, cyclo-cross bicycles, and hybrid bicycles can be made as or changed into a single speed. Mountain bike single speeds designed for trail riding often have a relatively low, or easy and slow, gear ratio. This allows them to climb hills and deal with obstacles and gradients better. This typically requires the rider to be more fit or skilled than the average rider in order to traverse the same terrain. Single speed bicycles designed for road riding typically have higher, or harder and faster, gear ratios.

Single speed bicycles and fixed-gear bicycles are popular with bicycle messengers for their reliability and durability. Depending on the situation, a messenger may prefer a mountain bike based single-speed, which can roll over many obstacles, or a fast and light road bike-based single-speed.

In the United States market, bicycle companies such as Bianchi, Cannondale, Fuji Bike, KHS, Kona, Raleigh, Giant, Specialized, Swobo, Felt, Trek and Niner all have produced and marketed single speed bicycles.

Because most full suspension frame designs either have a single pivot that is not concentric with the bottom bracket, or a linkage with a variable center of rotation, the distance between the bottom bracket and rear axle varies throughout the suspension&#x27;s travel. This requires a sprung chain tensioner, similar to a rear derailleur, to be used. Only relatively uncommon frame designs with single pivots that are concentric with the bottom bracket allow the use of more desirable static chain tensioners. Another consideration is the generally increased amount of pedalling while standing up that is inherent to single speed mountain biking, which increases losses from suspension bob and squat. Therefore, full suspension mountain bikes are fairly rare, with hardtails and rigid bikes being much more common.
==Chain tensioning==

Single-speed bicycle builders have devised a variety of methods for producing and maintaining the proper chain tension. The most common method is horizontal rear dropouts or track ends. These allow the rear wheel to be moved fore or aft as necessary. Using chain tugs with track ends ensures that optimum chain tension can be achieved with the wheel remaining centered. A similar design, sliding dropouts, uses detachable dropouts that are bolted to the frame through horizontal slots. This allows both quick release or bolt on hubs to be used, or through-axle hubs with the appropriate dropouts. Sliding dropouts usually have set screws that bear on the front of them through the frame to adjust their position for tensioning and wheel alignment. The main advantage of sliding dropouts over track ends is realized when they are used with disc brakes, as the brake caliper mount is part of the left dropout, and thus moves with the dropout, maintaining the hub to caliper distance. Sliding dropouts can also include a derailleur hanger if multi-speed use is desired.

Another method uses an eccentric mechanism either in the bottom bracket or in the rear hub. If neither of these are an option, when working with an existing frame not originally designed for single-speed use for example, some kind of idler pulley, such as the Surly Singleator
or simply a short cage rear derailleur can be used to take up chain slack. As well, finetuning the combination of chainring, cog, and chain length may suffice until the chain develops significant wear.

Throughout the years bicycle designers have produced belt-driven bicycles. While these belts cannot be shifted between gears like a chain, they offer singlespeed or hub geared drivetrains with improved increased wear resistance, quieter operation, and lubrication-free cleanliness. Belts also do not change length during their lifespan in the same way that chains &quot;stretch&quot; or increase in pitch as their link pivots wear. This keeps the pitch of the belt&#x27;s teeth constant and dramatically decreases wear on gear teeth. Belts have failed to overtake chains in popularity for bicycles because they have historically been less efficient. Also replacement of the one-piece belt requires traditional diamond bicycle frames to have a split chainstay or seatstay.
==Single-speed cycle conversions==
Single-speed bicycle builders have converted many former multi-geared cycles into single or fixed gear through the removal of the derailleurs and associated hardware. The simplest conversion uses the existing freewheel/cassette and crankset, the chain being cut to fit the desired gear ratio. However this retains unnecessary weight and the chainline will most likely not be perfect. A more thorough conversion will involve replacing the freewheel with a single-speed one, and re-dishing the rear wheel. On bicycles with vertical dropouts, a chain tensioner is often required to allow the correct tension on the resulting shorter chain.

A very popular &quot;off road&quot; mountain bike gearing, for the 26″ wheel size, is 39:18, approximately a 2:1 gear ratio and 56.35 gear inches, for versatile trail riding. A great &quot;on road&quot; gear ratio, for the 26″ wheel, is 42:17, approximately a 2.5:1 ratio and 64.2 gear inches for versatile tour riding. Many British enthusiasts used to tour on 27–inch–wheeled lightweights on a single fixed–gear of 69 inches before multi–speed gearing became universally popular, though this certainly made for tough work.

A reasonable &quot;road&quot; gear ratio, for the 700 × 28c wheel size a, is 46:17, approximately a 2.7:1 ratio and 71.75 gear inches, for very versatile asphalt riding, and a better lifespan with good road duty.

Fixed-gear setups work especially well with higher 40s chainrings, so the rotation ratio is closer to a wider 3:1, avoiding the tighter ratios, which will spin too fast, especially when descending steep hills.

Note that the larger diameter gear and chain ring, clearly, offers the best longevity, with much better wear characteristics than smaller gear and chain ring sets and less rounding of the teeth, over time.

==Flip-flop hubs==

Flip-flop, or double-sided hubs are threaded on both sides. Usually one side has a track-type threading (with lock ring), and the other side is threaded for a single-speed standard freewheel. It is possible to find them with track threading on both sides, but not easily. The cyclist can then change gears manually by reversing the drive wheel.

The usual way to use a flip-flop hub is to have a fixed gear on one side, and a single speed freewheel on the other. Ideally, the freewheel sprocket would be one or two teeth larger than the fixed sprocket. This allows for extended hill climbs at a lower ratio than the fixed gear provides. The freewheel in this gear also allows the cyclist to coast on a steep descent.

<doc id="972957" wikidata="Q2710861" url="?curid=972957" title="USS Raleigh (1776)">
<text>USS &quot;Raleigh was one of thirteen ships that the [[Continental Congress]] authorized for the [[Continental Navy]] in 1775. Following her capture in 1778, she served in the [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Raleigh. The ship is featured on the flag and seal of New Hampshire.

==As USS &quot;Raleigh&quot;==
&quot;Raleigh&quot;, a 32-gun frigate, was authorized by Continental Congress on 13 December 1775. Built by Messrs. James Hackett, Hill, and Paul under supervision of Thomas Thompson, the keel was laid on March 21, 1776, at the shipyard of John Langdon on what is now Badger&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on May 21, 1776.

With a full-length figure of Sir Walter Raleigh as figurehead, &quot;Raleigh&quot; put to sea under Captain Thomas Thompson, who also supervised her construction, on August 12, 1777. Shortly thereafter, she joined &quot;Alfred&quot; and sailed for France. Three days out they captured a schooner carrying counterfeit Massachusetts money. Burning the schooner and her cargo, except for samples, the frigates continued their transatlantic passage. On September 2 they captured the British brig, &quot;Nancy&quot;, and from her they obtained the signals of the convoy which the brig had been escorting from the rear. Giving chase, the Americans closed with the convoy on September 4, 1777.

&quot;Raleigh&quot;, making use of the captured signals, intercepted the convoy and engaged . In the ensuing battle she damaged &quot;Druid&quot;, but the approach of the other British escorts, and forced her to retire.

On 28 September she and captured brig &quot;Sally&quot;.

On December 29, 1777, &quot;Raleigh&quot; and &quot;Alfred&quot;, having taken on military stores, set sail from L&#x27;Orient, France, following a course that took them along the coast of Africa. After capturing British vessel &quot;Granville&quot; off the Bar of the Senegal River, &quot;Raleigh&quot; crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies. On March 9, 1778, in the Lesser Antilles, &quot;Alfred&quot;, some distance from &quot;Raleigh&quot;, was captured by the British ships and . &quot;Raleigh&quot;, unable to reach &quot;Alfred&quot; in time to assist her, continued north and returned to New England early in April 1778.

Accused of cowardice and dereliction of duty for not aiding &quot;Alfred&quot;, Captain Thompson was suspended soon after reaching port. On May 30, 1778, the Marine Committee appointed John Barry to replace him as captain.

Barry arrived in Boston to assume command on June 24 only to find his ship without crew or stores and the Navy Board not wholly in support of the manner of his appointment. His reputation and character, however neutralized the ill-will of the Marine Committee, drew enlistments, and helped to obtain the stores.

On September 25, &quot;Raleigh&quot; sailed for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with a brig and a sloop under convoy. Six hours later two strange sails were sighted. After identification of the ships as British the merchant vessels were ordered back to port. &quot;Raleigh&quot; drew off the enemy. Through that day and the next the enemy ships and pursued &quot;Raleigh&quot;. In late afternoon on the 27th, the leading British ship closed with her. A 7-hour running battle followed, much of the time in close action. About midnight, the enemy hauled off and Barry prepared to conceal his ship among the islands of Penobscot Bay.

The British, however, again pressed the battle. As &quot;Raleigh&quot; opened fire, Barry ordered a course toward the land. &quot;Raleigh&quot; soon grounded on Wooden Ball Island, part of Matinicus. The British hauled off but continued the fight for a while, then anchored. Barry ordered the crew ashore to continue the fight and to burn &quot;Raleigh&quot;.

A large party, including Barry, made it to shore. One boat was ordered back to &quot;Raleigh&quot; to take off the remainder of the crew, and destroy her, however the British again fired on the ship, striking the Continental colors. The battle was over. All three ships had been damaged, &quot;Unicorn&quot; particularly so. Of the Americans ashore, a few were captured on the island, but the remainder, including Barry, made it back to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving on October 7.

==As HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;==
The British refloated &quot;Raleigh&quot; at high tide on the 28th, and after repairs, commissioned her into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot;. They admired her design, and applied it in their new ships. She continued to fight during the War for Independence as a British vessel and took part in the capture of Charleston, South Carolina. In May 1780, she was decommissioned at Portsmouth, England, on June 10, 1781, and was sold in July 1783.

==Legacy==

&quot;Raleigh&quot; is depicted on the flag and seal of New Hampshire.

<text>The Transporter (French: Le Transporteur) is a 2002 English-language French action film directed by Corey Yuen and Louis Leterrier from a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. It is the first installment in the &quot;Transporter&quot; franchise and stars Jason Statham in the title role, alongside Shu Qi, François Berléand and Matt Schulze. In the film, Frank Martin, a British mercenary driver living in France, finds himself involved in a human trafficking plot.

&quot;The Transporter&quot; premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles on 2 October 2002 and was first theatrically released in the United States on 11 October by 20th Century Fox, and in France on 23 October by EuropaCorp. It received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its action sequences and Statham&#x27;s performance. It grossed $43.9 million worldwide and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Transporter 2&quot;, in 2005.

== Plot ==
Frank Martin is a highly skilled driver for less-than-legal jobs in southern France who follows three strict rules:

#Never change the deal.
#No names.
#Never open the package.

In Nice, Frank is hired as the getaway driver for three bank robbers, but they have brought a fourth man. Explaining that the extra weight will affect his precisely planned escape, Frank refuses to drive until, in desperation, the leader kills and abandons one of his men. After evading police in a high-speed chase, the leader offers Frank more money to drive them to Avignon, but he refuses; the robbers flee in another car, but are foiled by their amateur driving. At Frank&#x27;s villa on the French Riviera, local Police Inspector Tarconi questions him about his black BMW 735i, seen at the scene of the robbery, but Frank has carefully disposed of all evidence.

Frank is hired to deliver a package to American client Darren &quot;Wall Street&quot; Bettencourt. While changing a flat tire, Frank realizes the package contains a person; he violates his third rule in order to give the captive something to drink, and discovers a woman bound and gagged. She attempts to escape, but Frank recaptures her and is forced to subdue two policemen who spot them. Frank delivers her to Wall Street as promised, and is given a briefcase to transport. As Frank stops to buy drinks for the cops in his trunk, a bomb in the briefcase explodes.

A vengeful Frank returns to Wall Street&#x27;s villa, killing several henchmen and stealing a Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse, only to find &quot;the package&quot; hiding in the back seat. He brings the young woman, Lai, to his home, where she discovers he is a decorated former special operations soldier. Wall Street visits one of his surviving men in hospital, killing him after discovering Frank is alive. Tarconi questions Frank about the bombing of his car, which Frank claims was stolen, and Lai supports his alibi by introducing herself as his girlfriend. Tarconi leaves, and Wall Street&#x27;s men attack the house with missiles and automatic weapons, but Frank and Lai narrowly escape through an underwater passage to a nearby safe house where Lai seduces Frank.

Later, while being questioned at the police station by Tarconi, Lai accesses his computer to find information on Wall Street. She reveals that he is a human trafficker with 400 Chinese immigrants trapped in shipping containers, and Frank reluctantly agrees to help. They confront Wall Street at his office, where Lai&#x27;s father, Mr. Kwai, is revealed to be his partner in crime. Tarconi arrives as Wall Street subdues Frank and accuses him of kidnapping Lai, and Frank is arrested.

Tarconi suggests Frank take matters into his own hands, posing as his hostage to allow him to escape police custody. Recovering a weapons stash from his boat at the harbour of Cassis, Frank tracks the criminals to the Marseille docks, where the containers full of people depart on trucks. Chased to a bus depot, Frank fights his way through the thugs in a motor oil-drenched melee before escaping into the water. He steals an old car and gives chase at dawn before it breaks down, then commandeers a small airplane and parachutes down to the highway.

After a lengthy fight on the moving trucks, Frank throws Wall Street onto the road where he is crushed by the wheels (in the American version, Wall Street is only thrown out of the truck), only to be held at gunpoint by Kwai. He marches Frank to the edge of a cliff, but Lai shoots her father to save Frank, as Tarconi and the police rescue the people from the containers.

==Cast==
* Jason Statham as Frank Martin
* Shu Qi as Lai Kwai
* François Berléand as Inspector Tarconi
* Matt Schulze as Darren &quot;Wall Street&quot; Bettencourt
* Ric Young as Mr. Kwai
* Adrian Dearnell as Newscaster
== Production ==
The film was inspired by the short film series &quot;The Hire&quot;, which were produced as a promotional effort by BMW. Filming took place in on-location in the South of France: in Nice, Cassis, Saint-Tropez, Marseille, and Cannes. Jason Statham performed most of his own physical and driving stunts. Shu Qi spoke almost no English when she was cast, and had to learn most of her lines phonetically. Director Louis Leterrier originally intended Martin to be gay. However, this angle was dropped during filming, and a sex scene between Martin and Lai was added.

== Release ==

=== Theatrical release ===
&quot;The Transporter&quot; premiered in 2,573 theaters. With a production budget of $20.5 million, it grossed $25,296,447 in the United States and a total of $43,928,932 worldwide.

=== Censorship ===
The film was cut to receive a PG-13 rating in the United States, and this version was also released in the United Kingdom and several other countries. Japan was the only country besides France to receive the uncut versions. Certain sequences of violence were either cut or toned down for the PG-13 cut. The scenes changed in the American/international release are the fight on the bus, where scenes of Frank using a knife against the opponents were edited, and the scene where he throws Wall Street out of the truck; the French release has him crushed under its wheels, whilst the American/international release has him simply thrown out onto the road.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on 15 April 2003, and on Blu-ray on 14 November 2006.

== Reception ==
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 54% based on 128
reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Transporter&quot; delivers the action at the expense of coherent storytelling.&quot; At Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Manohla Dargis, of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, complimented the action, saying, &quot;[Statham] certainly seems equipped to develop into a mid-weight alternative to Vin Diesel. That&#x27;s particularly true if he keeps working with director Corey Yuen, a Hong Kong action veteran whose talent for hand-to-hand mayhem is truly something to see.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Too much action brings the movie to a dead standstill.&quot; Eric Harrison, of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, said, &quot;It&#x27;s junk with a capital J. The sooner you realize that, the more quickly you can settle down to enjoying it.&quot;

<text>The Gerridae are a family of insects in the order Hemiptera, commonly known as water striders, water skeeters, water scooters, water bugs, pond skaters, water skippers, water gliders, water skimmers or puddle flies. Consistent with the classification of the Gerridae as true bugs (i.e., suborder Heteroptera), gerrids have mouthparts evolved for piercing and sucking, and distinguish themselves by having the unusual ability to walk on water, making them pleuston (surface-living) animals. They are anatomically built to transfer their weight to be able to run on top of the water&#x27;s surface. As a result, one could likely find water striders present in any pond, river, or lake. Over 1,700 species of gerrids have been described, 10% of them being marine.

While 90% of the Gerridae are freshwater bugs, the oceanic &quot;Halobates&quot; makes the family quite exceptional among insects. The genus &quot;Halobates&quot; was first heavily studied between 1822 and 1883 when Francis Buchanan White collected several different species during the Challenger Expedition. Around this time, Eschscholtz discovered three species of the Gerridae, bringing attention to the species, though little of their biology was known. Since then, the Gerridae have been continuously studied due to their ability to walk on water and unique social characteristics.

==Description==
The family Gerridae is physically characterized by having hydrofuge hairpiles, retractable preapical claws, and elongated legs and body.

Hydrofuge hairpiles are small, hydrophobic microhairs. These are tiny hairs with more than one thousand microhairs per mm. The entire body is covered by these hairpiles, providing the water strider resistance to splashes or drops of water. These hairs repel the water, preventing drops from weighing down the body.

===Size===
They are generally small, long-legged insects and the body length of most species is between . A few are between . Among widespread genera, the North Hemisphere &quot;Aquarius&quot; includes the largest species, generally exceeding , at least among females, and the largest species averaging about . Females typically average larger than males of their own species, but it appears to be reversed in the largest species, the relatively poorly known &quot;Gigantometra gigas&quot; of streams in northern Vietnam and adjacent southern China. It typically reaches a body length of about in wingless males and in winged females (winged males, however, only average marginally larger than females). In this species each middle and hind leg can surpass .

===Antennae===
Water striders have two antennae with four segments on each. Antennal segments are numbered from closest to the head to farthest. The antennae have short, stiff bristles in segment III. Relative lengths of the antennae segments can help identify unique species within the family Gerridae, but in general, segment I is longer and stockier than the remaining three. The four segments combined are usually no longer than the length of the water strider head.

===Thorax===
The thorax of water striders is generally long, narrow, and small in size. It generally ranges from 1.6 mm to 3.6 mm long across the species, with some bodies more cylindrical or rounder than others. The pronotum, or outer layer of the thorax, of the water strider can be either shiny or dull depending on the species, and covered with microhairs to help repel water. The abdomen of a water strider can have several segments and contains both the metasternum and omphalium.

===Appendages===
Gerridae have front, middle, and back legs. The front legs are shortest and have preapical claws adapted to puncture prey. Preapical claws are claws that are not at the end of the leg, but rather halfway through, like mantises. The middle legs are longer than the first pair and shorter than the last pair and are adapted for propulsion through the water. The hind pair is the longest and is used for spreading weight over a large surface area, as well as steering the bug across the surface of the water. The front legs are attached just posterior to the eyes, while the middle legs are attached closer to the back legs which attach midthorax but extend beyond the terminal end of the body.

===Wings===
Some water striders have wings present on the dorsal side of their thorax, while other species of Gerridae do not, particularly &quot;Halobates&quot;. Water striders experience wing length polymorphism that has affected their flight ability and evolved in a phylogenetic manner where populations are either long-winged, wing-dimorphic, or short-winged. Wing dimorphism consists of summer gerrid populations evolving different length wings than winter populations within the same species. Habitats with rougher waters are likely to hold gerrids with shorter wings, while habitats with calm waters are likely to hold long-winged gerrids. This is due to potential for damage of the wings and ability for dispersal.

== Evolution ==
&quot;Cretogerris,&quot; from the Cretaceous (Albian) Charentese amber of France, was initially suggested as a gerrid. However, it was later interpreted as an indeterminate member of Gerroidea. They are morphologically similar to the unrelated &quot;Chresmoda,&quot; an enigmatic genus of insect known from the Late Jurassic to the Mid Cretaceous with a presumably similar lifestyle.

Molecular analysis suggest an origin of the family Gerridae about 128 Million years ago (Mya) in the Cretaceous, splitting from the sister group Veliidae, with whom they share a single origin of rowing as a locomotive mechanism. According on the transcriptome-based phylogeny, Gerridae is a monophyletic group.

==Wing polymorphism==
Wing polymorphism (i.e., the presence of multiple wing morphs in a given species) has independently evolved multiple times in Gerridae, as well as complete wing loss, something that has been important for the evolution of the variety in species we see today, and dispersal of Gerridae. The existence of wing polymorphism in a given species can be explained as a particular case oogenesis-flight syndrome. Following this rationale, which is commonly applied in insects, developing short wings provides the individual with the capacity to dedicate the energy stores that would usually be used for wing and wing muscle development to increasing egg production and reproducing early, ultimately enhancing the individual&#x27;s fitness. The ability for one brood to have young with wings and the next not allows water striders to adapt to changing environments. Long, medium, short, and nonexistent wing forms are all necessary depending on the environment and season. Long wings allow for flight to a neighboring water body when one gets too crowded, but they can get wet and weigh a water strider down. Short wings may allow for short travel, but limit how far a gerrid can disperse. Nonexistent wings prevent a gerrid from being weighed down, but prevent dispersal.

Wing polymorphism is common in the Gerridae despite most univoltine populations being completely apterous (wingless) or macropterous (with wings). Apterous populations of gerrids would be restricted to stable aquatic habitats that experience little change in environment, while macropterous populations can inhabit more changing, variable water supplies. Stable waters are usually large lakes and rivers, while unstable waters are generally small and seasonal. Gerrids produce winged forms for dispersal purposes and macropterous individuals are maintained due to their ability to survive in changing conditions. Wings are necessary if the body of water is likely to dry since the gerrid must fly to a new source of water. However, wingless forms are favored due to competition for ovarian development and wings and reproductive success is the main goal due to the selfish gene theory. Overwintering gerrids usually are macropterous, or with wings, so they can fly back to their aquatic habitat after winter. An environmental switch mechanism controls seasonal dimorphism observed in bivoltine species, or species having two broods per year. This switch mechanism is what helps determine whether or not a brood with wings will evolve. Temperature also plays an important role in photoperiodic switch. Temperatures signify the seasons and thus when wings are needed since they hibernate during winter. Ultimately, these switching mechanisms alter genetic alleles for wing characteristics, helping to maintain biological dispersal.

==Ability to walk on water==

Water striders are able to walk on top of water due to a combination of several factors. Water striders use the high surface tension of water and long, hydrophobic legs to help them stay above water. 
Gerridae species use this surface tension to their advantage through their highly adapted legs and distributed weight.

The legs of a water strider are long and slender, allowing the weight of the water strider body to be distributed over a large surface area. The legs are strong, but have flexibility that allows the water striders to keep their weight evenly distributed and flow with the water movement. Hydrofuge hairs line the body surface of the water strider. There are several thousand hairs per square millimeter, providing the water strider with a hydrofuge body that prevents wetting from waves, rain, or spray, which could inhibit their ability to keep their entire body above the water surface if the water stuck and weighed down the body. This position of keeping the majority of the body above the water surface, called &quot;epipleustonic&quot;, is a defining characteristic of water striders. If the body of the water strider were to accidentally become submerged, for instance by a large wave, the tiny hairs would trap air. Tiny air bubbles throughout the body act as buoyancy to bring the water strider to the surface again, while also providing air bubbles to breathe from underwater. Despite their success in overcoming submergence in water, however, water striders are not as competent in oil, and experimental oil spills have suggested that oil spilled in freshwater systems can drive water strider immobility and death.

The tiny hairs on the legs provide both a hydrophobic surface as well as a larger surface area to spread their weight over the water. The middle legs used for rowing have particularly well developed fringe hairs on the tibia and tarsus to help increase movement through the ability to thrust. The hind pair of legs are used for steering When the rowing stroke begins, the middle tarsi of gerrids are quickly pressed down and backwards to create a circular surface wave in which the crest can be used to propel a forward thrust. The semicircular wave created is essential to the ability of the water strider to move rapidly since it acts as a counteracting force to push against. As a result, water striders often move at 1 meter per second or faster.

==Life cycle ==
Gerrids generally lay their eggs on submerged rocks or vegetation using a gelatinous substance as a glue. Gravid females carry between two and twenty eggs. The eggs are creamy white or translucent, but become bright orange.

Gerrids go through the egg stage, five instar stages of nymphal forms, and then the adult stage. Instar durations of water striders are highly correlated throughout the larval period. This means that individuals tend to develop at the same rate through each instar stage. Each nymphal stage lasts 7–10 days and the water strider molts, shedding its old cuticle through a Y-shaped suture dorsal to the head and thorax. Nymphs are very similar to adults in behavior and diet, but are smaller (1 mm long), paler, and lack differentiation in tarsal and genital segments. It takes approximately 60 to 70 days for a water strider to reach adulthood, though this development rate has been found highly correlated to the water temperature the eggs are in.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===

Gerridae generally inhabit surfaces of calm waters. The majority of water striders inhabit freshwater areas, with the exception of &quot;Asclepios&quot;, &quot;Halobates&quot;, &quot;Stenobates&quot; and a few other genera, which inhabit marine waters. The marine species are generally coastal, but a few &quot;Halobates&quot; live offshore (oceanic) and are the only insects of this habitat. Gerridae prefer an environment abundant with insects or zooplankton and one that contains several rocks or plants to oviposit eggs on. It has been studied by prevalence of water striders in varying environments, that water striders most prefer waters around . Any water temperature lower than is unfavorable. This is likely due to the fact that development rates of young are temperature dependent [5]. The cooler the surrounding waters, the slower the development of the young is. Prominent genera Gerridae are present in Europe, the former USSR, Canada, US, South Africa, South America, Australia, China and Malaysia [5]. None have been yet identified in New Zealand waters.

===Diet===

Gerrids are aquatic predators and feed on invertebrates, mainly spiders and insects, that fall onto the water surface. Water striders are attracted to this food source by ripples produced by the struggling prey. The water strider uses its front legs as sensors for the vibrations produced by the ripples in the water. The water strider punctures the prey item&#x27;s body with its proboscis, injects salivary enzymes that break down the prey&#x27;s internal structures, and then sucks out the resulting fluid. Gerrids prefer living prey, though they are indiscriminate feeders when it comes to terrestrial insect type. Halobates, which are found on open sea, feed off floating insects, zooplankton, and occasionally resort to cannibalism of their own nymphs. Cannibalism is frequent and helps control population sizes and restrict conflicting territories. During the non-mating season when gerrids live in cooperative groups, and cannibalism rates are lower, water striders will openly share large kills with others around them. Some gerrids are collectors, feeding off sediment or deposit surface.

===Predators===
Gerrids, or water striders, are preyed upon largely by birds and some fish. Petrels, terns, and some marine fish prey on Halobates. Fish do not appear to be the main predators of water striders, but will eat them in cases of starvation. Scent gland secretions from the thorax are responsible for repelling fish from eating them. Gerrids are largely hunted by birds of a wide range of species dependent on habitat. Some water striders are hunted by frogs, but they are not their main food source. Water striders are also sometimes hunted by each other. Water strider cannibalism involves mainly hunting nymphs for mating territory and sometimes for food.

===Parasites===
Several endoparasites have been found in gerrids. Trypanosamatid flagellates, nematodes, and parasitic Hymenoptera all act as endoparasites. Water mite larvae act as ectoparasites of water striders.

===Dispersal===
Sudden increases in salt concentration in the water of gerrid habitats can trigger migration of water striders. Water striders will move to areas of lower salt concentration, resulting in the mix of genes within brackish and freshwater bodies. Nymphal population density also affects the dispersal of water striders. The higher density of water striders in the nymphal stage results in a higher percentage of brachypterous adults developing flight muscles. These flight muscles allow for the water striders to fly to neighboring bodies of water and mate, resulting in the spread of genes. This spread and mixing of genes can be beneficial due to a heterozygotic advantage. Generally, water striders will try to disperse in such a way to lower the density of gerrids in one area or pool of water. Most do this by flight, but those that lack wings or wing muscles will rely on the current of their water body or flooding. Eggs in &quot;Halobates&quot; are often laid on floating ocean debris and thus spread across the ocean by this drifting matter.

==Mating behavior==
Sex discrimination in some Gerridae species is determined through communication of ripple frequency produced on the water surface. Males predominantly produce these ripples in the water. There are three main frequencies found in ripple communication: 25 Hz as a repel signal, 10 Hz as a threat signal, and 3 Hz as a courtship signal. An approaching gerrid will first give out a repel signal to let the other water strider know they are in its area. If the other gerrid does not return the repel signal, then the bug knows it is a female and will switch to the courtship signal. A receptive female will lower her abdomen and allow the male to mount her and mate. A non-receptive female will raise her abdomen and emit a repel signal. Males that are allowed to mate stay attached to the same female for the entire reproductive season. This is to ensure that the female&#x27;s young belong to the mounting male and thus guarantee the spread of his genes. Females oviposit, or lay their eggs, by submerging and attaching the eggs to stable surfaces such as plants or stones. Some water strider species will lay the eggs at the water edge if the body of water is calm enough. The amount of eggs laid depends on the amount of food available to the mother during the reproductive season. The availability of food and dominance among other gerrids in the area both play crucial roles in the amount of food obtained and thus, resulting fecundity. Water striders will reproduce all year long in tropical regions where it remains warm, but only during the warm months in seasonal habitats. Gerrids that live in environments with winters will overwinter in the adult stage. This is due to the large energy cost which would need to be spent to maintain their body temperature at functional levels. These water striders have been found in leaf litter or under stationary shelters such as logs and rocks during the winter in seasonal areas. This reproductive diapause is a result of shortening day lengths during larval development and seasonal variation in lipid levels. Shorter day length signals the water strider of the coming temperature drops, also acting as a physical signal the body uses to store lipids throughout the body as food sources. Water striders use these lipids to metabolize during their hibernation. The length of the hibernation depends when the environment warms and the days become longer again.

==Social behavior==
Kin discrimination is rare in Gerridae, only really being seen in &quot;Halobates&quot;. Without hunger playing a role, several studies have shown that neither &quot;Aquarius remigis&quot; nor &quot;Limnoporus dissortis&quot; parents preferentially cannibalize on non-kin. Those two species are highly prevalent in American waters. These species do not show tendencies, leaving their young to forage on their own. Females cannibalize more on young than males do and, in particular, on first-instar nymphs. Young must disperse as soon as their wings are fully developed to avoid cannibalism and other territorial conflicts since neither parents nor siblings can identify members genetically related to themselves.

Gerridae are territorial insects and make this known by their vibration patterns. Both female and male adult Gerridae hold separate territories, though usually the male territories are larger than the female. During the mating season, gerrids will emit warning vibrations through the water and defend both their territory and the female in it. Even though gerridae are very conspicuous, making their presence known through repel signals, they often live in large groups. These large groups usually form during the non-mating season since there is less need to compete. Instead of competing to reproduce, water striders can work together to obtain nutrition and shelter outside of the mating season. Water striders will attempt to disperse when these groups become too dense. They do so by flying away or cannibalizing.

== In popular culture ==

* In the video game Super Mario 64, in the level &quot;Wet-Dry World,&quot; there are enemies named &quot;Skeeter&quot; that are based on water striders and their movement. The name comes from &quot;water skeeter&quot;, an alternative name for water striders.
*In the 2002 film &quot;The Tuxedo&quot;, water striders are genetically modified by bioterrorists to have bacteria that can spread from person to person, causing severe dehydration and instant death.

<doc id="972970" wikidata="Q736254" url="?curid=972970" title="Waiting to Exhale">
<text>Waiting to Exhale is a 1995 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Forest Whitaker (in his feature film directorial debut) and starring Whitney Houston and Angela Bassett. The film was adapted from the 1992 novel of the same name by Terry McMillan. Lela Rochon, Loretta Devine, Dennis Haysbert, Michael Beach, Gregory Hines, Donald Faison, and Mykelti Williamson rounded out the rest of the cast. The original music score was composed by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds. The story centers on four women living in the Phoenix metropolitan area and their relationships with men and one another.

==Plot==
Four friends (Savannah, Robin, Bernadine, and Gloria) get together frequently to support one another and listen to each other vent about life and love. They each want to be in a romantic relationship, but they each have difficulties finding a good man.

Successful television producer Savannah &quot;Vannah&quot; Jackson believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes that he won&#x27;t, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is.

Bernadine &quot;Bernie&quot; Harris, abandoned her career and dreams of having a catering business, instead raised a family and supported her husband John in building his business. He announces he is leaving her for a white woman with whom he works, sending her into an emotional tailspin that culminates in the two fighting over their assets after she burns his car, clothes and some of his other belongings, and then sells the rest of his things for a dollar each, and he retaliates by draining their bank accounts.

Robin Stokes is a high-powered executive and the long-time mistress of married Russell. After dumping him, she has problems finding someone suitable.

Beauty salon owner Gloria &quot;Glo&quot; Matthews is a single mother. Her ex-husband and the father of her son tells her that he was always bisexual and now realizes he is gay. Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King.

The situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up permanently dumping her married lover. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband and finds love with a widowed civil rights attorney who encourages her to pursue her catering dream. Robin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own. Gloria apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world. She learns not to be so protective of her son and lets him go on an &quot;Up with People&quot; trip to Spain. She finds love while learning to take care of herself rather than being self-sacrificing in her devotion to her son and her business.

==Production==
===Filming===
Parts of the film were shot at Monument Valley in Utah as well as Chandler, Fountain Hills, Phoenix and Paradise Valley in Arizona. Filming was temporarily halted for seven days after Houston suffered a drug overdose.

==Music==

The soundtrack album to the film features exclusively female African-American artists. The soundtrack includes the number-one hit songs &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot;, sung by the film&#x27;s star, Whitney Houston, and &quot;Let It Flow&quot; by Toni Braxton as well as &quot;Not Gon&#x27; Cry&quot; by Mary J. Blige, &quot;Sittin&#x27; Up in My Room&quot; by Brandy, and &quot;Count on Me&quot; by Whitney Houston and CeCe Winans, all of which reached the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; was a financial success, opening at number one at the North American box office and grossing $14.1 million its first weekend of release. In total, the film grossed $67.05 million in North America, and $14.4 million internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $81.45 million. Its widest release was just over 1,400 theatres, and it was the 26th highest-grossing film of 1995.

===Critical response===
Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics. Film critic Susan Stark from &quot;The Detroit News&quot; stated, &quot;For all the pleasure there is in seeing effective, great-looking black women grappling with major life issues on screen, &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; is an uneven piece.&quot; Reviewer Liam Lacey from &quot;The Daily Globe and Mail&quot; wrote of the film, &quot;[It] never escapes the queasy aura of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;: just another story about naive people with small problems.&quot; However, film critic Roger Ebert positively reviewed the film, stating that it is &quot;an escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, &#x27;I wish I had her problems&#x27;—and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.&quot; The film is notable for having an all-African-American cast. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a &quot;social phenomenon&quot;. The film received a 56% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; looks at life&#x27;s ups and downs from an underseen perspective -- albeit one that&#x27;s poorly served by uneven acting and a sporadically interesting story.&quot;

In the book &quot;Is Marriage for White People?&quot; writer and Stanford Law School professor Ralph Richard Banks states that the film is a perfect example of the problems African-American women have in finding serious relationships.

==Proposed sequel==
Interviewed in the spring of 2011 on an episode of &quot;The Talk&quot;, Angela Bassett confirmed that a sequel was in the planning stages, with all the female principals signed on to star, and Whitaker returning to direct. The film would supposedly be based on McMillan&#x27;s 2010 follow-up novel, &quot;Getting to Happy&quot;; McMillan was adapting the book to screenplay.

<doc id="972971" wikidata="Q1038910" url="?curid=972971" title="Obshchina">
<text>An &#x27; (, ; ) or &#x27; (, ; ), also officially termed as a [[Rural sociology|rural community]] (; ) between the 19th and 20th centuries, was a peasant village community (as opposed to an individual farmstead), or a khutor, in Imperial Russia. The term derives from the word (, literally &quot;common&quot;).

The mir was a community consisting of former serfs, or state peasants and their descendants, settled as a rule in a single village, although sometimes a village included more than one mir and, conversely, several villages were sometimes combined in a single mir. The title of the land was vested in the mir and not in the individual peasant. Members of the mir had the right to the allotment, on some uniform basis, of a holding that each member cultivated separately. A holding could not be sold or bequeathed without the consent of the mir. As a consequence of its collective tenure, the mir had the power to repartition the land from time to time among its constituent households. The mir dealt primarily with the household and not with the individual. The peasant had a right to a holding but not to a particular holding, and he could not dispose of it freely.

The vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a mir community which acted as a village government and a cooperative. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household. The purpose of this allocation was not so much social (to each according to his needs) as it was practical (that each person pay his taxes). Strips were periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census to ensure equitable share of the land. This was enforced by the state which had an interest in the ability of households to pay their taxes.

== History ==
The concept of Obshchina was an important part in Old Russia and had its roots in Slavic communities. A detailed statistical description of the Russian village commune was provided by Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov. Communal land ownership of the mir predated serfdom, surviving emancipation and the Russian Revolution. Until the abolition of serfdom in 1861, the could either contain serfs or free peasants. In the first case, lands reserved for serf use were assigned to the for allocation by the proprietor.

Even after the 1861 emancipation of the serfs, a peasant in his everyday work normally had little independence from obshchina, governed at the village level () by the full assembly of the community (). Among its duties were control and redistribution of the common land and forest (if such existed), levying recruits for military service and imposing punishments for minor crimes. Obshchina was also held responsible for taxes underpaid by members. This type of shared responsibility was known as (mutual responsibility), although the exact meaning of this expression has changed over time and now in Russian it has a negative meaning of mutual cover-up.

In 1905, repartitional tenure did not exist in the Baltic provinces, but it was used by a quarter of western and southwestern (i.e. Ukrainian) peasants, two thirds of steppe peasants and 96.9% elsewhere.

The institution was undermined by the Stolypin agrarian reforms (1906–1914). The ambitious reforms however failed to make a significant dent in the structure of peasant life in Russia.

== Structure ==
The organization of the peasant mode of production is the primary cause for the type of social structure found in the obshchina. The relationship between the individual peasant, the family and the community leads to a specific social structure categorized by the creation of familial alliances to apportion risks between members of the community. In the obshchina, alliances were formed primarily through marriage and common descent of kin. Usually, the eldest members of the household made up the mir to govern the redistribution of land. The families came together to form a community that depended on making taxes more equitable and the concept of mutual help. Jovan E. Howe writes: &quot;The economic relations so established are essentially distributive: through various categories of exchanges of both products and labor, temporary imbalances such as those occasioned by insufficient labor power of a newly-established family unit or a catastrophic loss, which places one unit at an unfair reproductive disadvantage in relation to its allies, are evened out&quot;. In addition, the alliance system had residual communal rights, sharing exchanges during shortages as well as certain distributive exchanges. Furthermore, the structure defined by these alliances and risk-sharing measures were regulated by scheduling and the ritualization of time. Howe writes that &quot;the traditional calendar of the Russian peasants was a guide for day-to-day living. The names attached to calendar dates, the calendrical periods into which they were grouped, the day on the week on which each fell, and the sayings connected with them encoded information about when to undertake tasks, but also about when not to work, when it was necessary to perform symbolic actions, take part in rituals and compulsory celebrations&quot;.

Peasants (i.e. three-quarters of the population of Russia) formed a class apart, largely excepted from the incidence of the ordinary law and governed in accordance with their local customs. The mir itself, with its customs, is of immemorial antiquity, but it was not until the 1861 emancipation of the serfs that the village community was withdrawn from the patrimonial jurisdiction of the landowning nobility and endowed with self-government. The assembly of the consists of all the peasant householders of the village. These elect a Village Elder () and a collector of taxes who was responsible, at least until the of October 1906 which abolished communal responsibility for the payment of taxes, for the repartition among individuals of the taxes imposed on the commune. A number of are united into a which has an assembly consisting of elected delegates from the .

The mir was protected from insolvency by the rule that the families cannot be deprived of their houses or implements necessary for agriculture; nor can the mir be deprived of its land.

== View on obshchinas ==
The mir or obshchina became a topic in political philosophy with the publication of August von Haxthausen&#x27;s book in 1847. It was in the mid-19th century that Slavophiles discovered the mir. Romantic nationalists and the Slavophiles hailed the mir as a purely Russian collective, both ancient and venerable; free from what they considered the stain of the bourgeois mindset found in western Europe. Not surprisingly, it was but a short step from this to the mir being used as a basis for Slavophilic idealist theories concerning communism, communalism, communal lands, history, progress and the nature of mankind itself.

By the second half of the 19th century, the Slavophiles were challenged by the opposing Western faction. Boris Chicherin, a leading spokesman for the Western school, argued that the mir was neither ancient nor particular to Russia. The mir, the Western school argued, had arisen in the late 17th to early 18th century and was not based on some sort of social contract or communal instinct. Rather, it was a monarchical creation, created and enforced for the purpose of tax collection. Whatever the merits of either case, both schools agreed that the landlord and the state both played a vital role in the development (if not the origin of) the mir:

Where (arable) land is scarce, the communal form of tenure tends to prevail, but where ever it (arable land) is abundant it is replaced by household or even family tenure.

The 19th-century Russian philosophers attached signal importance to obshchina as a unique feature distinguishing Russia from other countries. Alexander Herzen, for example, hailed this pre-capitalist institution as a germ of the future socialist society. His Slavophile opponent Aleksey Khomyakov regarded obshchina as symbolic of the spiritual unity and internal co-operation of Russian society and worked out a sophisticated &quot;Philosophy of Obshchina&quot; which he called sobornost.

The European socialist movement looked to this arrangement as evidence that Russian peasants had a history of socialization of property and lacked bourgeois impulses toward ownership:

Russia is the sole European country where the &quot;agricultural commune&quot; has kept going on a nationwide scale up to the present day. It is not the prey of a foreign conqueror, as the East Indies, and neither does it lead a life cut off from the modern world. On the one hand, the common ownership of land allows it to transform individualist farming in parcels directly and gradually into collective farming, and the Russian peasants are already practising it in the undivided grasslands; the physical lie of the land invites mechanical cultivation on a large scale; the peasant’s familiarity with the contract of artel facilitates the transition from parcel labour to cooperative labour; and, finally, Russian society, which has so long lived at his expense, owes him the necessary advances for such a transition. On the other hand, the contemporaneity of western production, which dominates the world market, allows Russia to incorporate in the commune all the positive acquisitions devised by the capitalist system without passing through its Caudine Forks [i.e. undergo humiliation in defeat].

<doc id="972988" wikidata="Q1079316" url="?curid=972988" title="Optic tract">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the optic tract () is a part of the visual system in the brain. It is a continuation of the optic nerve that relays information from the optic chiasm to the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus.

It is composed of two individual tracts, the left optic tract and the right optic tract, each of which conveys visual information exclusive to its respective contralateral half of the visual field. Each of these tracts is derived from a combination of temporal and nasal retinal fibers from each eye that corresponds to one half of the visual field. In more specific terms, the optic tract contains fibers from the ipsilateral temporal hemiretina and contralateral nasal hemiretina.

== Anatomy ==

=== Arterial supply ===
The optic tract receives arterial supply from the anterior choroidal artery, and posterior communicating artery.

== Function ==

=== Visual function ===
The optic tract carries retinal information relating to the whole visual field. Specifically, the left optic tract corresponds to the right visual field, while the right optic tract corresponds to the left visual field. To form the right visual field, temporal retinal fibers from the left eye and nasal retinal fibers from the right eye form the left optic tract, and to form the left visual field, temporal retinal fibers from the right eye and nasal retinal fibers from the left eye form the right optic tract.

=== Autonomic function ===
Several autonomic ocular motor responses are consensual. The optic tract is primarily responsible for relaying visual information to the LGN, but it is also peripherally responsible for transducing these bilateral autonomic reflexes, including the pupillary light reflex and pupillary dark reflex.

==== Pupillary light reflex ====
The pupillary light reflex is an autonomic reflex that controls pupil diameter to accommodate for increases in illumination as perceived by the retina. Higher light intensity causes pupil constriction, and the increase of light stimulation of one eye will cause pupillary constriction of both eyes. The neural circuitry of the pupillary light reflex includes the optic tract which joins the optic nerve to the brachium of the superior colliculus.

==== Pupillary dark reflex ====
Similarly to the pupillary light reflex, the pupillary dark reflex is an autonomic reflex that controls pupil diameter to accommodate for decreases in illumination as perceived by the retina. Lower light intensity causes pupil dilation, and the decrease of light stimulation of one eye will cause pupillary dilation of both eyes. Similarly, the neural circuitry of the pupillary dark reflex includes the optic tract which joins the optic nerve to the hypothalamus.

==Damage and pathologies==

===Lesions===
Lesions in the optic tract correspond to visual field loss on the left or right half of the vertical midline, also known as homonymous hemianopsia. A lesion in the left optic tract will cause right-sided homonymous hemianopsia, while a lesion in the right optic tract will cause left-sided homonymous hemianopsia. Stroke, congenital defects, tumors, infection, and surgery are all possible causes of optic tract damage. Peripheral prism expanders and vision restitution therapy may be employed in patients with visual field loss resultant of permanent optic tract damage.

===Split-brain===
In certain split-brain patients who have undergone a corpus callosotomy to treat severe epilepsy, the information from one optic tract does not get transmitted to both hemispheres. For instance, a split-brain patient shown an image in the left visual field will be unable to vocally name what has been seen as the speech-control center is in the left hemisphere of the brain.

===Pupillary reflexes===
Pupillary reflexes, particularly the pupillary light reflex, are a powerful diagnostic tool often employed in clinical and emergency medical practice. A lack of equal consensual pupillary constriction to a light stimulus, especially a Marcus Gunn pupil, can be indicative of optic nerve damage, brainstem death, or optic tract damage in between.

<doc id="972991" wikidata="Q1224586" url="?curid=972991" title="Digby, Nova Scotia">
<text>Digby is a Canadian town in southwestern Nova Scotia. It is in the historical county of Digby and a separate municipality from the Municipality of the District of Digby. The town is situated on the western shore of the Annapolis Basin near the entrance to the Digby Gut, which connects the basin to the Bay of Fundy.

Named after Admiral Robert Digby, the town has a scallop fishing fleet. The MV &quot;Fundy Rose&quot; ferry service connects the town to Saint John, New Brunswick.

==History==

Digby is called Oositookun, meaning ear of land, by the Mi&#x27;kmaq. A small group of New England Planters settled in the area of the town in the 1760s naming it Conway. However Digby was formally settled and surveyed as a town in June 1783 by the United Empire Loyalists under the leadership of Sir Robert Digby.

The town developed a sizable shipping fleet in the 19th century. One famous Digby vessel was the brigantine &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;, which discovered the famous mystery ship &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; in 1872. The town became an important regional transportation centre in the 1890s with the arrival of the Dominion Atlantic Railway. Trains connected with a series of steamships such as the &quot;City of Monticello&quot; and later the SS &quot;Princess Helene&quot;.

Digby&#x27;s history is preserved and interpreted by the Admiral Digby Museum, located facing the harbour in the historic Woodrow/Dakin home, one of oldest houses in the town.

==Tourism==

Tourism has played an important role in Digby during the 20th century beginning with the establishment of railway and steamship links that opened the town and surrounding communities as an-easy-to-reach destination for larger urban centres in eastern North America. A landmark in this industry was the construction of the Digby Pines Resort on the town&#x27;s outskirts. Built in 1905 and then purchased in 1917 by the Dominion Atlantic Railway, the resort provided a focal point to the local tourism industry with a large expansion in 1927. The Pines attracted notable visitors including early film star Theda Bara who spent her honeymoon there in 1921. Expanded several times since, it was bought by the Government of Nova Scotia after the Dominion Atlantic sold its hotels. About 20 additional motels, inns and bed and breakfast operations are based in Digby making tourism an important employer.

The annual Scallop Days Festival, held the first week of August, brings the fishing and tourism industries together to showcase the town&#x27;s history and heritage to the tourists. The festival offers a variety of themed activities for all ages, including scallop shucking contests, a parade, and an exhibition of local artists.

===Wharf Rat Rally===
Since 2004, Digby has become the destination of the largest motorcycle rally in Atlantic Canada, the annual Wharf Rat Rally. It attracts many times the town&#x27;s population; the town of 2,000 residents grows to 50,000 people, including 25,000 motorcycles. So many that schools and some roads have to close for the day due to crowds and motorcycle traffic. The Wharf Rat Rally event is held the weekend of Labour Day in August/September each year.

==Fishing==
Fishing has been an essential economic activity since the town&#x27;s settlement. Digby&#x27;s schooner fishery reached its peak in the early 1900s, documented by Frederick William Wallace. Later, trawlers, especially those harvesting scallops became the mainstay.

==Government==
The town council consists of a mayor and four councillors. The offices of Digby County are located immediately adjacent to the town. Digby is represented provincially by the riding of Digby-Annapolis and federally by the riding of West Nova. Numerous provincial and federal services for the county and western Nova Scotia such Access Nova Scotia and the Department of Community and Social Services are located in Digby.

==Amenities==
There is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) station located on Victoria Street.

The Digby General Hospital, located on Warwick Street, provides medical care to the residents of Digby. This includes Emergency Care, Primary Care, Inpatient Care, Restorative Care, Ambulatory Care, Day Surgery, Renal Dialysis. Although they provide emergency care, the Emergency Room does close occasionally due to a lack of physician or nursing coverage. During closures, patients are advised to go to the nearest hospital (Yarmouth or Kentville). As of March 2024, the base cost for a visit to the Emergency Room at the hospital for a non-Canadian visitor is $897.50 Canadian; that fee excludes any doctor&#x27;s fees, tests, or medicines. Similar charges apply in other hospitals and clinics.

==Geography==
Digby is located approximately from Yarmouth, and about from Downtown Halifax.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Digby had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>William S. Broomfield, (April 28, 1922 – February 20, 2019) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Early life==
Broomfield, the son of Scevillian C. and Fern Broomfield was born in Royal Oak, Michigan. His father was a dentist. He graduated from Royal Oak High School in 1940 and attended Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) at East Lansing. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Corps. After the war, he engaged in the real-estate and property-management business.

==Political career==

Broomfield was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, 1949–1954, serving as speaker pro tempore in 1953. He served in the Michigan State Senate in 1955 and 1956.

In 1956, Broomfield was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 18th District to the United States House of Representatives for the 85th and to the seventeen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1957, to January 3, 1993. Due to redistricting following U.S. Censuses, Broomfield served the 19th District, 1973–1983 and the 18th District, 1983–1993. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1992 to the 103rd Congress. The 18th District was discontinued following the 1990 census and for the most part redistricted as the 11th which elected Joe Knollenberg in 1993.

During his tenure in Congress, Broomfield served as a member of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs and was ranking member from 1975 until his retirement in 1993. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest serving Republican then serving in the House of Representatives. During his years of service in the House, Broomfield garnered praise from both sides of the aisle for his ethics, honesty and statesmanship. When he retired, he left behind a legacy of bipartisan friendship and cooperation.

Broomfield voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==Retirement==
After retirement in 1993, Broomfield started a foundation that supports various charities in southeast Michigan, including the efforts to cure cancer, spina bifida and Alzheimer&#x27;s, and the Salvation Army. A longtime resident of Lake Orion, Michigan, he last lived in Kensington, Maryland.

In September 2000, Congress designated the Royal Oak Post Office at 200 West 2nd Street in Royal Oak, Michigan, as the &quot;William S. Broomfield Post Office Building&quot;.

On December 30, 2006, Broomfield collapsed at the state funeral memorial for former U.S. President Gerald Ford at the United States Capitol, bringing the ceremonies to a temporary pause. The reason given for the collapse was exhaustion.

Broomfield&#x27;s wife Jane died on March 21, 2013, at the age of 97, due to heart failure. Broomfield died on February 20, 2019, at the age of 96 in Kensington, Maryland, where he resided in his later years.

<text>USDA soil taxonomy (ST) developed by the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Cooperative Soil Survey provides an elaborate classification of soil types according to several parameters (most commonly their properties) and in several levels: &quot;Order&quot;, &quot;Suborder&quot;, &quot;Great Group&quot;, &quot;Subgroup&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, and &quot;Series&quot;. The classification was originally developed by Guy Donald Smith, former director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s soil survey investigations.

== Discussion ==
A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the USDA soil taxonomy has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy. The names of the orders end with the suffix &quot;-sol&quot;. The criteria for the different soil orders include properties that reflect major differences in the genesis of soils. The orders are:
* Alfisol – soils with aluminium and iron. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* Andisol – volcanic ash soils. They are young soils. They cover 1% of the world&#x27;s ice-free surface.
* Aridisol – dry soils forming under desert conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of caliche or duripan. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* Entisol – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* Gelisol – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* Histosol – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* Inceptisol – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* Mollisol – soft, deep, dark soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* Oxisol – are heavily weathered, are rich in iron and aluminum oxides (sesquioxides) or kaolin but low in silica. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low CEC of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* Spodosol – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of coniferous and deciduous forests in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* Ultisol – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in calcium, magnesium and potassium (important plant nutrients). They are highly weathered, but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* Vertisol – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

The percentages listed above are for land area free of ice. &quot;Soils of Mountains&quot;, which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as &quot;Rugged Mountains&quot; which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The soil suborders within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.

The soil great group category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of &quot;soil subgroups&quot;: typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or &#x27;typical&#x27; concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.

A &quot;soil family&quot; category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale&#x27;s precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.

A family may contain several &quot;soil series&quot; which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the Merrimack River in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.

A &quot;soil phase of series&quot;, originally called &#x27;soil type&#x27; describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.

== Soil Type Classification Examples ==
Order: Entisols 
:Suborder: Fluvents 
::Great Group: Torrifluvents
:::Subgroup: Typic Torrifluvents 
::::Family: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, Typic Torrifluvents
:::::Series: Jocity, Youngston.

Order: Alfisols
:Suborder: Xeralfs
::Great Group: Durixeralfs
:::Subgroup: Abruptic Durixeralfs
::::Family: Fine, Mixed, Active, thermic Abruptic Durixeralfs
:::::Series: San Joaquin (soil)

== Soil temperature regimes ==

Soil temperature regimes, such as frigid, mesic, and thermic, are used to classify soils at some of the lower levels of the Soil Taxonomy. The cryic temperature regime distinguishes some higher-level groups. These regimes are based on the mean annual soil temperature (MAST), mean summer temperature, and the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures all at a soil depth of 50 cm. It is normally assumed that the MAST (in °C) equals the sum of the mean annual air temperature plus 2 °C. If the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 6 °C, then add &quot;Iso&quot; at the front of the name of the Soil Temperature Class.


== Soil moisture regimes ==

The soil moisture regime, often reflective of climatic factors, is a major determinant of the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural systems. The soil moisture regimes are defined based on the levels of the groundwater table and the amounts of soil water available to plants during a given year in a particular region. Several moisture regime classes are used to characterize soils. These categories are terminology modifiers at the soil suborder level of characterization.

<text>The Arts and Industries Building is the second oldest (after The Castle) of the Smithsonian museums on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Initially named the National Museum, it was built to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of its growing collections. The building, designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, opened in 1881, hosting an inaugural ball for President James A. Garfield. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. After being closed since 2004 for repair and renovation, the building reopened in 2021 with a special exhibition, &quot;Futures.&quot;

==Description==
The Arts and Industries Building was sited slightly farther back from the Mall than the Smithsonian Castle to avoid obscuring the view of the Castle from the Capitol. The building was designed to be symmetrical, composed of a Greek cross with a central rotunda. The exterior was constructed with geometric patterns of polychrome brick, and a sculpture entitled &quot;Columbia Protecting Science and Industry&quot; by sculptor Caspar Buberl was placed above the main entrance on the north side.

The interior of the building was partially lit through the use of skylights and clerestory windows. An iron truss roof covers the building. In 1883, the exterior was adjusted to use a more vibrant maroon-colored brick.

The building is composed of four pavilions, one at each corner, about square and three stories tall. These surround a central rotunda. Lower sections or &quot;ranges&quot; were placed outside the pavilions. Pervasive complaints of dampness and the poor health of the building&#x27;s occupants led to the replacement of the wood floors in the 1890s. Balconies were added in 1896–1902 to increase space after a new Smithsonian Building failed to be authorized by the United States Congress. A tunnel was constructed in 1901 to the Smithsonian Institution Building next door.

==History==

===1800s===
According to the Smithsonian Archives, &quot;the Congressional appropriation for the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition contained an interesting proviso. It stated that the appropriation was considered a loan, and if income from the exhibition allowed the loan to be repaid, Congress would then allow part of those funds to be used to construct a new building for the National Museum.&quot;

The success of the exhibits allowed the loan to be paid off soon after the event. As promised, then, a bill was introduced in Congress two years later by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian to build a suitable structure. The bill included plans developed by General Montgomery C. Meigs, which were based on the Government Building by James Windrim at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, which was itself inspired by structures at the 1873 Vienna Exposition. Funds were approved in 1879 and the design was executed by Cluss and Schulze, based on the Meigs plan.

During its construction, the materials featured at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition—up to &quot;sixty box cars worth&quot; of donations—were too numerous to fit in the Smithsonian Institution Building and so were temporarily stored in the District Armory Building at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue.

According to the aforementioned Smithsonian Archives, &quot;the first event to take place in the new National Museum Building was the Inaugural Ball for President James Garfield and Vice President Chester A. Arthur on March 4, 1881. A temporary wooden floor was laid, two electric lights were placed in the Rotunda, 10,000 bins for hats and coats were erected, 3,000 gas lights were installed, and festive buntings, state flags and seals decorated the halls. A colossal &quot;Statue of America&quot; stood in the Rotundia, illustrative of peace, justice and liberty, grasping in her uplifted hand an electric light &quot;indicative of the skill, genius, progress, and civilization&quot; of America in the 19th century.&quot;

Eight months later the museum officially opened to the public. &quot;It contained 80,000 square feet of exhibit space with specially designed mahogany exhibit cases. The exhibit halls contained exhibits on geology, metallurgy, zoology, medicine, anthropology, art, history and technologies such as ceramics, printing, transportation, textiles, fisheries, and agriculture.&quot; Under the guidance of George Brown Goode, a historian and ichythyologist, a Division of Arts and Industries and Materia Medica was established that same year and materials from the museum were sent to many late nineteenth century expositions to teach people about the country&#x27;s political and natural history.

===1900s===

In 1910, the natural history collections were moved to the new National Museum of Natural History, and the old National Museum Building was renamed the Arts and Industries Building.

In 1964 additional exhibitions were moved to the National Museum of History and Technology, now known as the National Museum of American History.

In the middle of 1975, the building was closed to the public to begin moving its remaining exhibits to the newly constructed National Air and Space Museum. Restoration work was performed over the next year at a cost of $4.5 million, including the installation of air conditioning.

In May 1976, the Arts and Industries Building reopened with &quot;1876: A Centennial Exhibition&quot;, featuring the Philadelphia Exposition artifacts it was originally built to house. Added later were series of temporary exhibitions and a children&#x27;s theater, known as the &quot;Discovery Theater&quot;.

===2000s===
By 1995, the building was reported to be in disrepair and at risk of closing down. By 2000, plastic tarps were in place to protect visitors from debris from the crumbling roof. In 2004, the building was closed to the public indefinitely, as funding for the necessary repairs was uncertain.

The building&#x27;s uncertain future and deteriorating condition led the National Trust for Historic Preservation to name it in 2006 as one of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places, an annual list of endangered historic sites. In 2009 it was scheduled to receive $25 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for renovation work.
Revitalization of the shell alone was solicited in 2010. A complete restoration was projected to cost $200 million ($65 million in structural renovations alone) and last until 2014. In January 2014, the Smithsonian announced that the building would remain closed for the foreseeable future, citing funding concerns. But on April 12, 2015, Smithsonian Acting Secretary Albert Horvath said about 40 percent of the building would reopen in fall 2015 for use as a short-term exhibit space. Smithsonian officials said that the building had been architecturally stabilized, and minor refurbishments made to the bathrooms, HVAC system, and interior paint scheme. Horvath said the building would not completely reopen and its fate had not yet been clarified or determined.

After 2015, the building was used occasionally for special events, such as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. The Arts and Industries Building reopened in November 2021 for its first exhibition since 2004, &quot;Futures&quot;, scheduled to run through July 2022. Afterward, the building is scheduled to be closed for significant renovations, which would allow it to be permanently reopened as early as 2028. The building was evaluated as a possible home for the National Museum of the American Latino or the Smithsonian American Women&#x27;s History Museum.

The building has hosted a number of exhibitions and artists in residence, such as Catie Cuan, a Futurist-in-Residence who performed at the closing ceremonies of the &quot;Futures&quot; exhibit on July 6, 2022.

<doc id="973019" wikidata="Q292073" url="?curid=973019" title="Brett Butler (actress)">
<text>Brett Butler (born January 30, 1958) is an American actress, writer, and stand-up comedian. She is best known for playing the title role in the ABC comedy series &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; (1993–1998), for which she received two Golden Globe Awards nominations.

==Life and career==
===Early life ===
Butler was born Brett Anderson in Montgomery, Alabama, the eldest of five sisters. She was four years old when her father, Roland Decatur Anderson Jr., an oil company executive, moved the family to Houston, Texas. Her mother Carol left Roland, an abusive alcoholic, and moved with their children to Miami, Florida. Her mother battled depression, and the family was sometimes so poor that they ate Tootsie Rolls for dinner. Butler briefly attended the University of Georgia. Before experiencing success as a stand-up comic, she worked as a cocktail waitress.

In 1978, at the age of 20, Butler married her first husband, Charles Michael Wilson, three months after their meeting. Wilson was abusive and in 1981 she left him. Since then, he has both admitted and adamantly denied battering Butler, while claiming that she too was violent. Butler returned to her mother in Miami and began performing in comedy clubs, settling on the stage name &quot;Brett Butler&quot; as a play on the southern U.S. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; character of Rhett Butler. She moved to New York City in 1984, and was arrested for possession of marijuana. In New York, she met her second husband, Ken Zieger, and they were married in 1987.

In 1987, Butler made her television debut on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Also that year, she performed on Dolly Parton&#x27;s short-lived variety series, &quot;Dolly&quot;. Parton hired Butler as a writer for the remainder of the show&#x27;s season, but the series was cancelled after one season of lackluster ratings.

===&quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and beyond===

In 1993, Butler starred in the ABC comedy series &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, created by Chuck Lorre. Butler starred as Grace Kelly, a divorced single mother and recovering alcoholic. The show begins after the main character divorces her abusive alcoholic husband of eight years in an attempt to start life anew and prevent her children from making the same mistakes she did. For her performance, Butler received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1995 and 1997, and won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Female Performer in 1994. She reprised her role of Grace Kelly in &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot; in 1997.

Butler published her memoir, &quot;Knee Deep in Paradise&quot;, in 1996. The book was started before attaining her celebrity status, and candidly addresses much of this time, ending the autobiography before &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;″s debut.

Behind the scenes, Butler battled a recurring drug addiction and spent time in rehab. In February 1998, due to her erratic behavior stemming from substance abuse, she was dismissed from the show and ABC cancelled the series. After &quot;Grace&quot; was cancelled in 1998, Butler moved from Los Angeles to a farm in Rome, Georgia. In the following years she made selected screen appearances in films &quot;Bruno&quot; (2000) and &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot; (2005), and guest-starred on an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; in 2005. In 2008, Butler headlined at an arts fundraiser and spoke freely with a reporter about her depression, past drug addiction, television work, and current life on the farm. She also expressed interest in writing another book.

===Return to acting===
In October 2011, Butler appeared on &quot;The Rosie Show&quot; and reported being sober since 1998. According to an &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; interview at around the same time, Butler, unable to maintain the costs of her farm, had lived in a homeless shelter, though in a 2021 &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; profile, Butler denied that she was ever homeless, and said she was paid to fabricate this claim for the show. By this time Butler was attempting to make a career comeback and was working on developing a reality TV show about her self-professed psychic abilities and performing at the Downtown Comedy Club in Los Angeles.

In June 2012, Butler appeared in a recurring role on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; playing ex-psychiatrist Tim Reid&#x27;s girlfriend. She returned for two episodes in March 2015. Later in 2012, she began appearing in a recurring role as the bartender at the restaurant that Charlie Goodson (Charlie Sheen) frequents in the FX comedy series &quot;Anger Management&quot;. Butler appeared in a total of 38 episodes from 2012 to 2014. In 2016, she played herself in the comedy-drama film &quot;The Comedian&quot; starring Robert De Niro.

Later, Butler began appearing in dramatic roles. She guest-starred in two episodes of HBO drama series &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, and had a recurring role as Michaela&#x27;s (Aja Naomi King) adoptive mother Trishelle in the ABC legal thriller &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; in 2016. From 2018 to 2019, she played Tammy Rose Sutton in the AMC horror series, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. Also in 2019, she took a recurring role as Sandy Jackson, the mother of Reese Witherspoon&#x27;s character in the Apple TV+ drama series, &quot;The Morning Show&quot;.

<text>, also known as Amami, is the largest island in the Amami archipelago between Kyūshū and Okinawa. It is one of the Satsunan Islands.

The island, 712.35 km2 in area, has a population of approximately 73,000 people. Administratively it is divided into the city of Amami, the towns of Tatsugō, Setouchi, and the villages of Uken and Yamato in Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Guntō National Park.

In 2021, it was listed as part of the serial UNESCO World Heritage Site of Amami-Ōshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, northern part of Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island.

==History==
It is uncertain when Amami Ōshima was first settled. Stone tools indicate settlement in the Japanese Paleolithic period, and other artifacts, including pottery, indicate a constant contact with Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun period Japan.

The island is mentioned in the ancient Japanese chronicle &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; in an entry for the year 657 AD. During the Nara period and early Heian period it was a stopping place for envoys from Japan to the court of Tang dynasty China. Mother of pearl was an important export item to Japan. Between 1571 and 1611, Amami Ōshima was briefly incorporated as part of the Ryukyu Kingdom as it expanded northwards along the archipelago. As Ryukyu was a tributary vassal of Ming China, this changed the status of the island as well.

To counter Ming authority, the island was invaded by samurai from Shimazu clan in 1609 and its incorporation into the official holdings of that domain was recognized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1624. Shimazu rule was harsh, with the inhabitants of the island reduced to serfdom and forced to raise sugar cane to meet high taxation, which often resulted in famine. Saigō Takamori was exiled to Amami Ōshima in 1859, staying for two years, and his house has been preserved as a memorial museum. After the Meiji Restoration Amami Ōshima was incorporated into Ōsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Following World War II, along with the other Amami Islands, it was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan.

Since February 1974, a area that includes portions of the island and surrounding sea was protected as the Amami Gunto Quasi-national Park. The area also has a large mangrove forest.

In December 2001 there was a naval battle called the Battle of Amami-Ōshima between an armed North Korean spy craft and Japanese Coast Guard ships near Amami Ōshima. The spy craft violated the Exclusive economic zone of Japan. This was a six-hour confrontation that ended with the sinking of the North Korean vessel.

In 2017 the Amami Guntō National Park was established. It absorbed the former Amami Gunto Quasi-national Park and other land and sea areas in adjacent municipalities.

==Geography==
Amami Ōshima is the seventh-largest island in the Japanese archipelago after the four main islands, Okinawa Island and Sado Island (excluding the disputed Kuril Islands). It is located approximately south of the southern tip of Kyūshū and north of Okinawa. The island is of volcanic origin, with Mount Yuwanda at above sea level at its highest peak. The coast of the island is surrounded by a coral reef, and the island may also have been home to some of the northernmost coral reefs in Japan during the last glacial period. It is surrounded by the East China Sea on the west and the Pacific Ocean on the east.

Amami Ōshima belongs to Kagoshima prefecture. It consists of the following municipalities.

* Amami
* Tatsugo
* Yamatomura
* Usomura
* Part of Setouchi-cho

==Climate==
The climate of Amami Ōshima is classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and mild winters. The rainy season lasts from May through September. The island is subject to frequent typhoons.

==Fauna==
Amami Ōshima is home to several rare or endangered endemic animals, including the Amami rabbit and the Lidth&#x27;s jay, both of which are now found only in Amami Ōshima and Tokunoshima. The Amami rabbit is sometimes called a living fossil because it represents an ancient Asian lineage that has elsewhere disappeared.

The island is also home to the habu, a venomous snake that can be found throughout the Ryūkyū Islands. Mongooses were introduced to kill the habu, but have become another problem, as an increase in the mongoose population has been linked to the decline of the Amami rabbit and other endemic species. After the mongoose population reached 10,000 by 2000, authorities launched an eradication campaign that led to the complete eradication of mongoose on the island by 2024.

Whale watching to see humpback whales has become a featured attraction in winter in recent years. It is also notable that North Pacific right whale, the most endangered of all whale species, have repeatedly appeared around the island (there are five records of three sightings, a capture, and a stranding since 1901) and , Amami is the only location in East China Sea where this species has been confirmed in the past 110 years. It is also one of two locations in the world along with the Bonin Islands where constant appearance in winter has been confirmed since the 20th century. Discovery of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Seto strait made it the first confirmation in the nation. Other species include whales (Bryde&#x27;s, sperm), smaller whales or dolphins (false killer, spinner, spotted), and so on. Before being wiped out, many large whales such as blue and fin were seasonal migrants.

The island marks the northernmost limit of dugong distribution, with occasional sightings throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.

Amami Oshima is the only place where a nesting of leatherback turtle has been seen in Japan.

==Demographics==
Amami Oshima had a population of 73,000 people in 2013. 44,561 people live in the city of Amami. The total area of Amami city is 308.15 km2 with a population density of 145 persons per km2.

==Economy==
The economy of Amami Ōshima is based on agriculture (sugar cane, rice and sweet potatoes), commercial fishing, and the distillation of shōchū. The favorable climate allows for two rice crops a year. Seasonal tourism is also an important part of the economy.

Traditional crafts on the island include the production of high quality hand-crafted silk called Ōshima-tsumugi which is mainly used to make kimono. Along with Persian carpets and Gobelin tapestries, is said to be one of the world&#x27;s three great textiles.
Ōshima-tsumugi is dyed with mud to create their characteristic black color.

==Transportation==

The port of Naze, located in the city of Amami is a major regional shipping and ferry hub.

Amami Airport, located at the northern end of the island, is connected to Tokyo, Osaka, Naha, Fukuoka and Kagoshima as well as local flights to the other Amami Islands. There are bus routes and roads on the island.

==Language==

Two dialects of the Amami language are spoken in Amami Ōshima: the Northern Ōshima dialect and the Southern Ōshima dialect. These dialects are part of the Ryukyuan languages group. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there were about 10,000 speakers of the Northern Ōshima dialect and about 1,800 speakers of the Southern Ōshima dialect. These dialects are now spoken mostly by older residents of the island, while most of the younger generations are monolingual in Japanese. The Amami language, including the Ōshima dialects, is classified as endangered by UNESCO.

There is also a village sign language, named as Amami Oshima Sign Language, being used in the area.

<text>Professional baseball is organized baseball in which players are selected for their talents and are paid to play for a specific team or club system. It is played in leagues and associated farm teams throughout the world.

==Modern professional leagues==

===Americas===

====United States and Canada====

Major League Baseball in the United States and Canada consists of the National League (founded in 1876) and the American League (founded in 1901). Historically, teams in one league never played teams in the other until the World Series, in which the champions of the two leagues played against each other. This changed in 1997 with the advent of interleague play. The Philadelphia Phillies, founded in 1883, are the oldest continuous same-name, same-city franchise in both Major League Baseball and all of American professional sports.

In addition to the major leagues, many North American cities and towns feature minor league teams. An organization officially styled Minor League Baseball, formerly the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, oversees nearly all minor league baseball in the United States and Canada. The minor leagues are divided into classes AAA, AA, High-A, A, and Rookie. These minor-league divisions are affiliated with major league teams, and serve to develop young players and rehabilitate injured major-leaguers. &quot;Affiliated baseball&quot; (archaically, &quot;organized baseball&quot;) is often applied as an umbrella term for all leagues — major and minor — under the authority of the Commissioner of Baseball.

Operating outside the Minor League Baseball organization are many independent minor leagues such as the Atlantic League, American Association, Frontier League, and the feeder league to these the Empire Professional Baseball League.

====Caribbean countries====
* Dominican Professional Baseball League (1951–present; winter league)
* Puerto Rico Baseball League (1938–present)
* Cuban National Series (1961–present)

====Mexico====
* Mexican Pacific League (1945–present; winter league)
* Mexican League (1925–present; summer league)

==Historic leagues==
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, players of black African descent were barred from playing the major leagues, though several did manage to play by claiming to be Cubans or Native Americans. As a result, a number of parallel Negro leagues were formed. However, after Jackie Robinson began playing with the major-league Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, the Negro leagues gradually faded. The process of integration did not go entirely smoothly; there were some ugly incidents, including pitchers who would try to throw directly at a black player&#x27;s head. Now, however, baseball is fully integrated, and there is little to no racial tension between teammates.

Between 1943 and 1954, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League fielded teams in several Midwestern towns.

<doc id="973043" wikidata="Q2202270" url="?curid=973043" title="Amien Rais">
<text>Muhammad Amien Rais (born 26 April 1944) is an Indonesian politician. He was one of the leaders of the reform movement that forced the resignation of President Suharto in 1998. Amien Rais was the leader of Muhammadiyah, one of the two biggest Muslim organizations in Indonesia, from 1995 to 2000. He was the Chairman of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) from 1999 to 2004. During his chairmanship, the MPR passed a series of amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia. These amendments, among other things, established direct presidential elections, a presidential term limit (two terms), and the Constitutional Court.

==Early life and education==
Amien Rais was born in Surakarta, Central Java, as the second child of Suhud Rais and Sudalmiyah Rais. The couple were Muhammadiyah activists in Surakarta. His father, Suhud Rais, graduated from Muhammadiyah&#x27;s Mualimin high school. He worked in Surakarta&#x27;s religion affairs office. He also was a member of Muhammadiyah&#x27;s Board of Education in the Surakarta chapter. His mother, Sudalmiyah, was born in 1912 and was an activist in Aisyiyah, a Muhammadiyah&#x27;s women organization and had been its chairperson for 20 years. She graduated from Muhammadiyah&#x27;s teaching school &#x27;Hogere Indlansche Kweekschool&#x27;. She was a member of Masyumi party in the 1950s. She was awarded &#x27;The Central Java Best Mother&#x27; in 1985 and died in 2001.

== Activism career==
After his studies in the United States, he was a Middle East specialist and was noted for being a critic of US foreign policy. Controversially, Rais learned a lot about human rights and democracy in the US. Amien Rais&#x27; activities in Muhammadiyah began in 1985 when he led The Council of Preacher (&quot;Majelis Tabligh&quot;). Later in 1990, Rais was vice chairman elected in a convention (&quot;muktamar&quot;) in Yogyakarta. Amien Rais was also active in the newly established Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI), a Muslim scholars association. Rais led ICMI&#x27;s Expert Council, but resigned in 1997 under pressure from Suharto because he argued on the Busang and the Freeport cases. In 1995, Rais replaced Azhar Basyir, then the chairman of Muhammadiyah, who died soon after his re-election. In 1993, at a Muhammadiyah mid-term meeting (&quot;Tanwir&quot;) in Surabaya, Rais urged a presidential succession, a very rare issue amid the New Order regime. The political and economical decay in Indonesia during the 90s had Rais call for a controversial issue: political reform. Amien Rais&#x27; calls were one of the many catalysts that led to the eventual downfall of the New Order regime. This made him enemy number one of the Suharto administration.

==Political career==
=== Fall of Suharto === 
In 1998, Amien Rais became an outspoken critic, and allied himself with the reform movement. However, this would also force the New Order regime to ban any demonstration reflecting the people&#x27;s voice regarding &quot;Reformasi.&quot; In May 1998, Jakarta was in chaos following rioting in some parts of the city. The army and the police forces were unable to handle the situation. Meanwhile, President Suharto embarked on a state visit to Cairo, Egypt. Upon his return from Cairo, Suharto learned that the situation was out of control. Several days later, he invited some prominent Muslim figures – including Abdurrahman Wahid, Emha Ainun Najib, Nurcholish Madjid and Malik Fajar – to discuss the nation&#x27;s current condition. Suharto proposed to establish a Reform Committee, to reshuffle the cabinet ministers and to resign from the presidency within 6 months. This was not responded to by those who attended the meeting. Suharto panicked as 14 of his ministers resigned from the cabinet. On 20 May, Amien Rais cancelled the mass rally to Monas square as an army general threatened to make &quot;another Tiananmen&quot; should he do so. Less than 24 hours later, Suharto resigned from his office and was replaced by Vice President B.J. Habibie. 

=== National Mandate Party ===

Amien Rais and other reformists established the National Mandate Party (&quot;Partai Amanat Nasional&quot;/PAN) on 6 August 1998. Amien Rais was elected its first chairman with Faisal Basri as secretary general. Therefore, his position in Muhammadiyah was replaced by vice chairman Ahmad Syafi&#x27;i Maarif. PAN gained 6 percent of the vote in the 1999 election but failed to nominate Rais as a presidential candidate. However, political compromise allowed Amien to lead the People Consultative Assembly (MPR). As a kingmaker, Amien Rais and other Islam parties and Golkar elected Abdurrahman Wahid as president and Megawati Sukarnoputri as vice president. Amien Rais was also a leading figure in the Indonesian constitution amendment process.

=== 2004 Presidential election ===

Amien Rais ran and lost in the 2004 presidential election. He and running mate Siswono Yudo Husodo were nominated by PAN, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and some small political parties, and finished in the fourth place with 15% of the vote.

=== Ummah Party ===

On 1 October 2020, he formed a new party called Ummah Party (Indonesian: &quot;Partai Ummat&quot;), which he claimed to &quot;work and fight with fellow countrymen against tyranny and injustice&quot;. Deputy chairman of PAN, Viva Yoga Mauladi, confirmed Amien&#x27;s departure from the party. Before leaving PAN, he was involved in internal rift with fellow party politicians over support for Jokowi&#x27;s administration. Ridho Rahmadi, Amien Rais&#x27; son-in-law, was appointed the party&#x27;s inaugural chairman.

== Other activities ==
Amien Rais is currently the Chairman of PAN&#x27;s Advisory Board, Muhammadiyah&#x27;s Advisory Board, and is a professor at Gadjah Mada University. One of the founders of PAN, Abdillah Toha criticized him for his controversial statements and inconsistencies on many issues including his support on changing local elections to be indirect, and called him a &quot;traitor of the Reform&quot;.

== Controversies ==
In a corruption scandal trial of a former health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, Amien Rais was reported to have received funds related the case. He admitted that he had received the funds but then accused the Corruption Eradication Commission of being an incompetent organization.

<doc id="973053" wikidata="Q438141" url="?curid=973053" title="Thomas Morley">
<text>Thomas Morley (1557 – early October 1602) was an English composer, theorist, singer and organist of late Renaissance music. He was one of the foremost members of the English Madrigal School. Referring to the strong Italian influence on the English madrigal, &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; states that Morley was &quot;chiefly responsible for grafting the Italian shoot on to the native stock and initiating the curiously brief but brilliant flowering of the madrigal that constitutes one of the most colourful episodes in the history of English music.&quot;

Living in London at the same time as Shakespeare, Morley was the most famous composer of secular music in Elizabethan England. He and Robert Johnson are the composers of the only surviving contemporary settings of verse by Shakespeare.

Morley was active in church music as a singer, composer and organist at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He was also involved in music publishing. From 1598 up to his death he held a printing patent (a type of monopoly). He used the monopoly in partnership with professional music printers such as Thomas East.

==Life and career==
Morley was born in Norwich, the son of a brewer. Most likely he was a singer in the local cathedral from his boyhood, and he became master of choristers there in 1583. He may have been a Roman Catholic, but he was able to avoid prosecution as a recusant, and there is evidence that he may have been an informer on the activities of Roman Catholics.

It is believed that Morley moved from Norwich to London sometime before 1574 to be a chorister at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Around this time, he studied with William Byrd, whom he named as his mentor in his 1597 publication &quot;A Plain and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot;. Byrd also taught Morley&#x27;s contemporary, Peter Philips. In 1588 he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Oxford, and shortly thereafter was employed as organist at St. Paul&#x27;s in London. His young son died the following year in 1589. He and his wife Susan had three more children between 1596 and 1600.

In 1588 Nicholas Yonge published his &quot;Musica transalpina&quot;, the collection of Italian madrigals fitted with English texts, which touched off the explosive and colourful vogue for madrigal composition in England. Morley found his compositional direction at this time, and shortly afterwards began publishing his own collections of madrigals (11 in all).

Morley lived for a time in the same parish as Shakespeare, and a connection between the two has been long speculated, but never proven. His famous setting of &quot;It was a lover and his lass&quot; from &quot;As You Like It&quot; has never been established as having been used in a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s play during the playwright&#x27;s lifetime. However, given that the song was published in 1600, there is evidently a possibility that it was used in stage performances.

While Morley attempted to imitate the spirit of Byrd in some of his early sacred works, it was in the form of the madrigal that he made his principal contribution to music history. His work in the genre has remained in the repertory to the present day, and shows a wider variety of emotional colour, form and technique than anything by other composers of the period. Usually his madrigals are light, quick-moving and easily singable, like his well-known &quot;Now Is the Month of Maying&quot; (which is actually a ballett); he took the aspects of Italian style that suited his personality and anglicised them. Other composers of the English Madrigal School, for instance Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye, were to write madrigals in a more serious or sombre vein.

In addition to his madrigals, Morley wrote instrumental music, including keyboard music (some of which has been preserved in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;), and music for the broken consort, a uniquely English ensemble of two viols, flute, lute, cittern and bandora, notably as published by William Barley in 1599 in &quot;The First Booke of Consort Lessons, made by diuers exquisite Authors, for six Instruments to play together, the Treble Lute, the Bandora, the Cittern, the Base-Violl, the Flute &amp; Treble-Violl&quot;.

Morley&#x27;s &quot;Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot; (published 1597) remained popular for almost two hundred years after its author&#x27;s death, and is still an important reference for information about sixteenth century composition and performance.

Thomas Morley was buried in the graveyard of the church of St Botolph Billingsgate, which was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666, and not rebuilt. Thus his grave is lost.

<doc id="973054" wikidata="Q1057831" url="?curid=973054" title="Irish Gospels of St. Gall">
<text>The Irish Gospels of St. Gall or Codex Sangallensis 51 is an 8th-century Insular Gospel Book, written either in Ireland or by Irish monks in the Abbey of St. Gall in Switzerland, where it is now in the Abbey library of St. Gallen as MS 51. It has 134 folios (that is, 268 pages). Amongst its eleven illustrated pages are a Crucifixion, a Last Judgement, a Chi Rho monogram page, a carpet page, and Evangelist portraits.

It is designated by 48 on the Beuron system, and is an 8th-century Latin manuscript of the New Testament. The text, written on vellum, is a version of the old Latin. The manuscript contains the text of the four Gospels on 134 parchment leaves . It is written in two columns, in Irish semi-uncials. It has been in the St Gall library since at least the 10th century, when it is recorded in the earliest catalogue.

The Latin text of the Gospel of John is a representative of the Western text-type. The text of the other Gospels represents the Vulgate version.

== Origin ==
The Irish Gospels preserved in the Abbey Library are among the finest illustrated manuscripts extant. Because of the square script and the use of minuscule for a liturgical text, O&#x27;Sullivan suggested that they might have originated in central Ireland, and Joseph Flahive dates them to around 780. They display a close stylistic affinity with the Faddan More Psalter discovered in 2006, almost miraculously, in a bog near Birr, which is also in the Irish midlands.

The manuscript itself offers no precise information about its place of origin. On page 265, however, there is an entry in a Carolingian minuscule that possibly dates back as far as the second half of the 9th century, apparently imitating the Irish script. This is a sign that the volume had reached the mainland by the 9th or 10th century at the latest and was probably already in St. Gallen. Although there is no clear evidence that it had anything to do with the donation of books by the Irish bishop Marcus and his nephew Móengal during the period between 849 and 872, the idea cannot be ruled out.

== Content ==
The manuscript contains the four gospels in the form of an Irish hybrid which draws on both Vetus Latina and the Vulgate. Striking from an artistic perspective are the facing pages with which each gospel begins. Each pair consists of an impressive portrait of the evangelist on the left and beautifully crafted incipit on the right. The equilibrium of these double-page compositions is one of the supreme accomplishments of Irish book art. The same quality is evident in a carpet page (p. 6), another decorative initial (p. 7), and depictions of the Crucifixion (p. 266) and the Last Judgment (p. 267) at the end of the book. The initial pages for the Gospels of Mark and John (pp. 78/79 and 208/209) differ in style from the others, so it can be assumed that two different illuminators were at work.

<doc id="973059" wikidata="Q605831" url="?curid=973059" title="Speed skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics">
<text>At the [[1932 Winter Olympics]], four [[speed skating]] events were contested. For the only time in the Olympic history, the speed skating were held as pack-style events, having all competitors skate at the same time. Women were allowed to compete in speed skating for the first time in history in a set of demonstration events. The IOC was reluctant to upgrade women’s events to full medal events, although the organizing committee of the Games advocated for the full inclusion of women’s events. The distances for women were 500 m, 1000 m and 1500 m. The pack-style racing would pave the way for short track speed skating, that would debut as a demonstration event at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary before becoming an official Olympic event at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.

The men&#x27;s competitions were held on Thursday, February 4, 1932, Friday, February 5, 1932, Saturday, February 6, 1932, and on Monday, February 8, 1932. The women&#x27;s events were contested from Monday, February 8, 1932 to Wednesday, February 10, 1932.

==Medal summary==
==Women&#x27;s events==
Speed skating events for women were demonstration events at the 1932 Games, so no official medals were awarded. Two nations, the USA and Canada, with 10 competitors entered the competition. Like the men&#x27;s races that used the mass start racing in heats, the women&#x27;s races were as well. The official results show the winning time for each event.

==Participating nations==
Eight speed skaters competed in all four events. A total of 31 male speed skaters from six nations competed at the Lake Placid Games. In addition, ten female speed skaters (five from the United States as well as five from Canada) competed in the women&#x27;s demonstration events.

<text>Dishwasher Pete is the pen name for Pete Jordan, author of the popular &quot;Dishwasher&quot; zine as well as the book of the same title, whose goal was to wash dishes in every state in America. For more than a decade, he moved from city to city, state to state, washing dishes in restaurants, hospitals, cafeterias, ski resorts, camps, communes, a fish cannery, an offshore oil rig, a dinner train and just about anywhere where dishes were dirty. He was once invited to appear on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. He did not wish to be on national television, and so a friend of his took his place on the show, pretending to be him. Later, while promoting his book, Pete himself appeared on Letterman and the two discussed the earlier &quot;appearance.&quot;

The fifteen issues of the &quot;Dishwasher&quot; zine are now out of print. Memoirs of Jordan&#x27;s dishwashing years were published in the book &quot;Dishwasher: One Man&#x27;s Quest to Wash Dishes in All 50 States&quot; by Harper Perennial in 2007; it was positively reviewed in &quot;Chicagoist.&quot; Without reading it, &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Dwight Garner initially dismissed the book; upon chiding by readers of his column, he wrote &quot;Boy, was I wrong about it - it&#x27;s exceedingly well-written and explores an American subculture, one Jordan has been working in for more than a decade, with real tact and feeling and humor.&quot;

Dishwasher Pete has contributed to five episodes of the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot;. His writing has also appeared on the Open Letters website.

Dishwasher Pete also volunteered as a &quot;human guinea pig&quot; in first-in-man drug trials, and contributed articles to the &quot;Guinea Pig Zero: A Journal for Human Research Subjects&quot; zine.

In 2002 Pete moved to Amsterdam, where he became fascinated by the culture and history of this city of cyclists. This is the basis for his second book: &quot;In the City of Bikes: The Story of the Amsterdam Cyclist&quot; (Harper Perennial, 2013).

<doc id="973064" wikidata="Q4800291" url="?curid=973064" title="Arthur Sinclair">
<text>Commodore Arthur Sinclair (28 February 1780 – 7 February 1831) was a United States Navy officer who served in during the Quasi-War, the First Barbary War and the War of 1812. His three sons also served in the Navy; they resigned in 1861, however, to serve in the Confederate States Navy.

==Early Naval Service==
Born in Virginia, the youngest son of Arthur Sinclair I who had served in the Royal Navy during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear and the Continental Navy during the American Revolution, Sinclair entered the Navy as Midshipman in 1798. He served as Midshipman in &quot;Constellation&quot; during the capture of the French frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; on 9 February 1799. He was attached to the Mediterranean Squadron from June 1804 to July 1806, participating in the attacks on Tripoli on board &quot;Essex&quot;. He then sailed Gunboat No. 10 to the United States.

==War of 1812==
===Raiding British shipping on Argus===
On 10 June 1807 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. On 13 December 1811, he was ordered to the command of &quot;Argus&quot;; and, between 12 October and 17 December 1812, cruised in &quot;Argus&quot; with the North Atlantic Squadron and took a number of prizes. During the cruise, he became separated from the squadron and was chased for three days and nights by an enemy squadron before his superior ship handling enabled him to escape.

===Raid at St. Marys River===
For much of the War of 1812, Sinclair was assigned to the Great Lakes as part of Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s squadron, where he commanded the warship &quot;General Pike&quot; in an engagement on Lake Ontario on 28 September 1813. For his valor during another engagement on Lake Erie in 1813, Sinclair received a presentation sword from the Commonwealth of Virginia (now in the Virginia Historical Society&#x27;s collection). In 1814, he commanded &quot;Niagara&quot; on Lake Huron and Lake Superior and directed the naval squadron in the Battle of Mackinac Island and the Engagement on Lake Huron. Sinclair conducted a hit-and-run raid at St. Marys River, Upper Canada, capturing a small merchantman, the &quot;Mink&quot;. After capturing the merchantman in the raid, Arthur Sinclair withdrew back to American lines in Michilimackinac.

===Extension of Sinclair&#x27;s Raid===
In extension of his raid at St. Marys River. Sinclair sent Daniel Turner with a detachment of seamen alongside regulars under Andrew Holmes to penetrate deeper into enemy territory. Turner destroyed buildings, possessions, and burned a schooner. Turner withdrew back to American territory in Michilimackinac, reuniting with Sinclair.

===Raid at St. Joseph Island===
On July 12, 1814. Arthur Sinclair commanding 5 vessels transported 550 American regulars and 250 militia led by Lt. Colonel George Croghan who was the hero of Fort Stephenson. Sinclair sailed his force to St. Joseph Island where the British abandoned their outpost. Sinclair landed the American infantry force, and the Americans found a British vessel that had been set on fire by the British who evacuated. The Americans put the fire out to salvage the ship. But after examining the ship, the Americans restarted the fire and destroyed the ship. The Americans also burned the empty British post and also burned down the Canadian Northwest Company trading post. Then the Americans boarded the ships of Sinclair&#x27;s fleet and departed to their next objective.

===Raid at Mackinac Island===
On August 4, 1814. Arthur Sinclair moved his fleet to Mackinac Island that was under British occupation. The objective of the American fleet was to retake Mackinac Island. Sinclair steered his fleet to Mackinac. Sinclair lands the American infantry on the rear of the British post on the island. Lt. Col George Croghan advanced with his regulars and militia. But the British had set a position to resist the American advance. Croghan&#x27;s regulars were ambushed by Indians allied to the British. The Americans engaged the British-Indian force. The Americans suffered 13 killed and 52 wounded. The British-Indian forces suffered maybe 1 killed and 1 wounded. The Americans gave up their objective after suffering heavy casualties and retreated to the ships of Sinclair&#x27;s fleet. Arthur Sinclair&#x27;s fleet withdrew from the Island.

===Raid at Nottawasaga===
 Arthur Sinclair steered his fleet to raid Nottawasaga. On August 13, 1814, Sinclair sent his two vessels Lawrence and Caledonia back to Detroit. Then Sinclair moved on with his 3 remaining vessels &quot;Niagara&quot;, &quot;Scorpion&quot; and &quot;Tigress&quot; to Nottawasaga to attack a British outpost. Sinclair arrived at the location and landed infantry troops with artillery. The American land artillery and Sinclair&#x27;s cannons on his ships bombarded the British blockhouse. The British sailors and militia realizing they could not hold off the American assault any longer burned their schooner &quot;Nancy&quot; and blew up their blockhouse before retreating suffering 1 killed and 1 wounded. The Americans recovered the guns in the destroyed blockhouse and placed them on their ships. The American then felled trees across the river to block it. Sinclair left two gunboats to blockade the area under the command of Lieutenant Daniel Turner. Sinclair instructed Turner to intercept any British supply shipping and then return to Detroit when the weather turned bad. Arthur Sinclair withdrew back to Detroit in his vessel &quot;Niagara&quot; with the three newly captured British guns. Daniel Turner patrolled the area with his two gunboats. But the British sailors, militia, and Native American allies under Miller Worsley removed the tree abatis obstacles and stealthily snuck on the American gunboats and ambushed them. The Americans under Daniel Turner were all captured suffering 6 killed and 6 wounded. The victorious British suffered 3 killed and 9 wounded.

==Promotion==
Promoted to Captain in 1813, he commanded the frigate &quot;Congress&quot; in 1817; commanded the 74-gun ship of the line &quot;Washington&quot; in 1818. In 1819, he rose to the rank of Commodore and was placed in command of the Norfolk Navy Yard. It was while there, that he conceived the idea of a Nautical School and was allowed to set one up on board the frigate &quot;Guerriere&quot;, for the education and development of young naval officers. It was from that small start that the current U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis has grown.

Commodore Sinclair died at Norfolk, Virginia on 7 February 1831.

==Family==
The family originated from the Shetland Islands off Scotland and were reputedly distant relations of Scottish royalty. The first Arthur Sinclair, of Scalloway, in Shetland, sailed with Commodore George Anson in 1740, on a mission to capture Spanish possessions in the Pacific, during Britain&#x27;s war with Spain. The mission lasted for four years and resulted in the little fleet circumnavigating the world. Loss of life was horrendous, with only 188 of the original 1,854 men surviving to make it back to England.

Arthur Sinclair I left the expedition when they reached America and eventually settled in Norfolk, Virginia, where he made claim to a large tract of land, and became a sea captain sailing between Virginia and England. After the death of his first wife he married Susanna Phillips of Halifax County, in Middlesex County on 22 February 1766 at the age of 59. Their son, Arthur II, was born in 1780. During the War of American Independence (1775-1783) Sinclair served in the Continental Navy, fighting against his old countrymen. He retired to Cobham in Surry County where he died in 1791 at age 84. 

Arthur Sinclair II married first, Elizabeth, daughter of General John Hartwell Cocke, of Mt Pleasant, in Surry County. They had two children, twins, Robert Carter Nicholas d 1806 and Augusta (died 3 weeks after birth) Mar 1802. These children died young and their mother died in 1803.

Arthur Sinclair II married second on 20 Jan 1810 in Halifax County, Sarah (Sally) Short Skipwith Kennon (30 Oct 1790 - 21 August 1827), daughter of Colonel Richard Kennon of Conjurer&#x27;s Neck, Chesterfield County.

Arthur and Sally had seven children:

1. Arthur Sinclair (29 Nov 1810 - 14 Jan 1865), Commander USN, CSN, served on the CSS Alabama, married, 20 Apr 1835, Lelia Imogene Dawley of Norfolk.

2. Elizabeth Beverly Sinclair Whittle (26 Jul 1812 - 1855), married Captain William Conway Whittle, USN, CSN

3. Richard Kennon Sinclair (8 Nov 1814-7 Jul 1815)

4. George Tarry Sinclair (29 Sep 1816 - 25 Jul 1885) LT USN, CSN 2 May 1843, Mary Thompson (5 Jan 1825 - 6 Nov 1888)

5. Dr. William Beverly Sinclair (22 Jan 1818 - 27 Sep 1895), surgeon, USN, CSN, a prominent physician, married 11 Nov 1844, Lucy Franklin Read Jones

6. Sarah Sinclair (22 Jul 1820), died in infancy

7. Gilberta Fayette Sinclair (19 Oct 1824 - 27 Apr 1906), married Dr. Conway Davies Whittle, of Norfolk.

Arthur Sinclair II was the great-grandfather of novelist Upton Sinclair, author of the novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906). He was also the second great-grandfather of Vice Admiral Lloyd M. Mustin and third great-grandfather of Vice Admiral Henry C. &quot;Hank&quot; Mustin and the fourth great-grandfather of Vice Admiral John Mustin.

==Namesake==
The destroyer USS &quot;Sinclair&quot; (DD-275) was named for him.

<doc id="973077" wikidata="Q1134678" url="?curid=973077" title="An American Tail">
<text>An American Tail is a 1986 American animated musical adventure comedy-drama film directed by Don Bluth and written by Judy Freudberg and Tony Geiss from a story by David Kirschner, Freudberg and Geiss. The film stars the voices of Phillip Glasser, John Finnegan, Amy Green, Nehemiah Persoff, Dom DeLuise, and Christopher Plummer. It is the story of Fievel Mousekewitz and his family as they emigrate from the Russian empire to the United States for freedom, but Fievel gets lost and must find a way to reunite with them.

The film was released in the United States on November 21, 1986, by Universal Pictures, four months after Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; was released. It received positive reviews and was a box office hit, making it the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at the time; the film is currently Don Bluth&#x27;s third highest-grossing animated film, only behind &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988) and &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997).

Its success, along with that of fellow Bluth film &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (both 1988), and Bluth&#x27;s departure from their partnership, prompted executive producer Steven Spielberg to establish his own animation studio, Amblimation, in London, England.

The film spawned a franchise (made without the involvement of Bluth) that included a sequel, &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; (1991); a CBS television series based on the film, &quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot;, premiered in 1992; and two additional direct-to-video sequels set between the first two films, &quot;An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island&quot; (1998) and &quot;An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster&quot; (1999).

== Plot ==

In 1885 Shostka, Russia, the Mousekewitzes are a Russian-Jewish family of mice who live with a human family named Moskowitz. While celebrating Hanukkah, Papa gives his hat to his seven-year-old son, Fievel, and tells him about the United States, a country in which he believes there are no cats. The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an anti-Semitic arson attack and their cats attack the village mice. The Moskowitz home, along with that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed, while Fievel narrowly escapes from the cats. They flee the village in search of a better life.

In Hamburg, Germany, the Mousekewitzes board a tramp steamer, setting sail for New York City. All the mice aboard are ecstatic at the process of going to America, believing that there are &quot;no cats&quot; there. During a thunderstorm on their journey, Fievel finds himself separated from his family and washed overboard. Thinking that he has died, they proceed to the city as planned, though they become depressed at his loss.

However, Fievel floats to New York in a bottle and, after a pep talk from a French pigeon named Henri, decides to look for his family. He encounters conman Warren T. Rat, who sells him to a sweatshop. He escapes with Tony Toponi, a street-smart Italian mouse, and they join up with Bridget, an Irish mouse trying to rouse her fellow mice to fight the cats. When a gang of them called the Mott Street Maulers attacks a mouse marketplace, the immigrant mice learn that the tales of a cat-free country are not true.

Bridget takes Fievel and Tony to see Honest John, an alcoholic politician who knows the city&#x27;s voting mice. However, he is unable to help Fievel search for his family, as they have not yet registered to vote.

Led by the rich Gussie Mausheimer, the mice hold a rally to decide what to do about the cats. Warren is extorting them all for protection that he never provides. No one knows what to do about it until Fievel whispers a plan to Gussie. Although his family also attends, they stand well in the back of the audience, and they are unable to recognize Fievel onstage with her.

The mice take over an abandoned museum on the Chelsea Piers and begin constructing their plan. On the day of launch, Fievel gets lost and stumbles upon Warren&#x27;s lair. He discovers that he is actually a cat in disguise and the leader of the Maulers. They capture and imprison Fievel, but his guard is a reluctant member of the gang, a vegetarian tabby cat called Tiger, who becomes friends and frees him.

Fievel races back to the pier with the cats chasing after him and exposes Warren as a cat when Gussie orders the mice to release the secret weapon. A huge mechanical mouse, inspired by the bedtime tales Papa told Fievel of the &quot;Giant Mouse of Minsk&quot;, chases Warren and his gang down the pier and into the water. A tramp steamer bound for Hong Kong picks them up on its anchor and carries them away. However, a pile of leaking kerosene cans has caused a torch lying on the ground to ignite the pier, and the mice are forced to flee when the fire department arrives to extinguish it.

During the fire, Fievel is once again separated from his family and ends up at an orphanage in an alley. Papa and Tanya overhear Bridget and Tony calling out to Fievel. Papa is sure that there is another &quot;Fievel&quot; somewhere, until Mama finds his hat. Meanwhile, the orphans mock Fievel, and tell him that his family should be looking for &quot;him&quot;, not the other way around, and that they don&#x27;t care about him. He agrees, and cries himself to sleep.

Joined by Gussie, Tiger allows them to ride him. This allows them to find Fievel. Papa returns Fievel&#x27;s hat, commenting that it now fits him, and he has grown up into a mouse. Henri ends the journey by taking everyone to see his newly completed project—the Statue of Liberty, which appears to smile and wink at Fievel and Tanya, and the Mouskewitzes&#x27; new life in the United States begins.
== Voice cast ==
* Phillip Glasser as Fievel Mousekewitz. While &quot;Fievel&quot; is a generally accepted spelling of his name, the opening credits spell it as &quot;Feivel&quot;, the more common transliteration of the Yiddish name (פֿײַװל &quot;Fayvl&quot;) (Cf. Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz and Feivel Gruberger). The main protagonist, he is the only son of Papa and Mama Mousekewitz. A high-spirited, daring yet naïve Russian-Jewish mouse, Fievel becomes a frightened child when he is separated from his family. The strength and the encouragement from his new American friends from Henri to Tony and Bridget give him the fortitude to reach his goal in reuniting with his family while starting a new life in America. Fievel was the name of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s grandfather, whose stories as an immigrant influenced the film (the ending credits spell his name as &quot;Fievel&quot;). However, many English-speaking writers have come to adopt the spelling &quot;Fievel&quot;, especially for this character; this spelling was used on the film&#x27;s poster, in promotional materials and tie-in merchandise, and in the title of the sequel &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;. His last name is a play on the Russian-Jewish last name &quot;Moskowitz&quot;, the name of the human occupants of the house his family is living under at the beginning of the film. 
* John Finnegan as Warren T. Rat, a small Havana Brown who disguises himself as a rat. He is the leader of the Mott Street Maulers, an all-cat gang which terrorizes the mice of New York City. Conniving and a schemer, he misleads the gullible Fievel at one point. Later on, he gets his comeuppance when Fievel discovers and later exposes him as a cat to the Mouse community. He is accompanied everywhere by his accountant Digit, a small English-accented cockroach.
* Amy Green as Tanya Mousekewitz (singing voice provided by Betsy Cathcart), Fievel&#x27;s older sister, whom he mutually adores. Optimistic and cheerful, less daring but more obedient than her brother, she alone believes (correctly) that he survived being washed overboard en route to the United States. She is given the American name &quot;Tillie&quot; at the immigration point at Castle Garden.
* Nehemiah Persoff as Papa Mousekewitz, the head of the Mousekewitz family who plays the violin and tells stories to his children.
* Erica Yohn as Mama Mousekewitz, Fievel&#x27;s mother. Countering Papa&#x27;s dreamy idealism, she is a level-headed pragmatist, besides being stricter with their offspring than he is. She also has a fear of flying.
* Pat Musick as Tony Toponi, a streetwise teenage mouse of Italian descent. His &quot;tough guy&quot; attitude suits his New York surroundings. The name &quot;Toponi&quot; is a play on &quot;topo&quot;, the Italian word for &quot;mouse&quot;. He hits it off with Fievel, acting as a surrogate big brother to the younger mouse, whom he calls &quot;Philly&quot;. In a subplot, he falls in love with Bridget. 
* Dom DeLuise as Tiger, the most physically imposing member of the Mott Street Maulers, for whom he serves as an enforcer, and often is the brunt of their cruel jokes. Although not especially intelligent, Tiger is very friendly, and his warm nature endears him to mice and birds. He is mostly vegetarian, aside from the occasional bit of fish. Tiger becomes Fievel&#x27;s best friend. He enjoys card games like poker and gin rummy, despite being terrible at them. Tiger&#x27;s singing voice also helps him stand out; he sings Lyric and Dramatic Bass and Lyric and Dramatic Baritone, from D2 or E2 to F4 or G4.
* Christopher Plummer as Henri le Pigeon, a pigeon of French descent, who oversees construction of the Statue of Liberty.
* Cathianne Blore as Bridget, an attractive, elegant Irish-born mouse and Tony&#x27;s significant other. Her parents were slain and devoured by the Mott Street Maulers, making her an advocate in speaking out against the cats. Kind, passionate yet soft-spoken, she acts as a surrogate big sister to Fievel.
* Neil Ross as Honest John, a local Irish-born mouse politician who knows every voting mouse in New York City. An ambulance-chasing drunkard, he takes advantage of voters&#x27; concerns to increase his political prestige. John is a caricature of real-life Tammany Hall boss John Kelly (also nicknamed &quot;Honest John&quot;) and other 19th-century New York City politicians.
* Madeline Kahn as Gussie Mausheimer, a German-born mouse considered the richest in New York City, who rallies the mice into fighting back against the cats. Despite being against cats, she later accepts Tiger for helping reunite Fievel with his family.
* Will Ryan as Digit, Warren&#x27;s British cockroach accountant who has a fondness for counting money but is plagued by frequent electrical charges in his antennae whenever he gets nervous or excited.
* Hal Smith as Moe, a fat rat who runs the local sweatshop. Fievel is sold to him by Warren.
* Dan Kuenster as Jake, Warren&#x27;s burly aide-de-camp. Among the Mott Street Maulers, he alone enjoys listening to his leader&#x27;s violin music. Jake catches Fievel after a chase through the sewers. After Tiger takes pity on Fievel and sets him free, Jake and his fellow Maulers pursue the young mouse to the Chelsea Pier, only to face the &quot;Giant Mouse of Minsk&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Production began in December 1984 as a collaboration between Spielberg, Bluth, and Universal, based on a concept by David Kirschner. Originally, the idea was conceived as a television special, but Spielberg felt it had potential as a feature film. Spielberg had asked Bluth to &quot;make me something pretty like you did in &quot;NIMH&quot;...make it beautiful&quot;. In a 1985 interview, he described his role in the production as &quot;first in the area of story, inventing incidents for the script, and now consists of looking, every three weeks to a month, at the storyboards that Bluth sends me and making my comments&quot;. Bluth later commented that &quot;Steven has not dominated the creative growth of &quot;Tail&quot; at all. There is an equal share of both of us in the picture&quot;. Nevertheless, this was Spielberg&#x27;s first animated feature, and it took some time for him to learn that adding a two-minute scene would take dozens of people months of work. In 1985, he stated: &quot;At this point, I&#x27;m enlightened, but I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so complicated&quot;. It was Universal Pictures&#x27; first animated feature film since &quot;Pinocchio in Outer Space&quot; in 1965 and the first animated film that they co-produced.

=== Writing ===
Originally, the concept consisted of an all-animal world, like Disney&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, but Bluth suggested featuring an animal world existing as a hidden society from the human world, like his own &quot;NIMH&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. After viewing &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, Spielberg agreed. Emmy Award-winning writers Judy Freudberg and Tony Geiss (known for their work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) were brought in to expand the script. When the initial script was complete, it was extremely long and was heavily edited before its final release. Bluth felt uncomfortable with the main character&#x27;s name, thinking &quot;Fievel&quot; was too foreign-sounding, and he felt audiences wouldn&#x27;t remember it. Spielberg disagreed. The character was named after his maternal grandfather, Philip Posner, whose Yiddish name was Fievel. The scene in which he presses up against a window to look into a classroom filled with American &quot;school mice&quot; is based on a story Spielberg remembered about his grandfather, who told him that Jews were only able to listen to lessons through open windows while sitting outside in the snow. Spielberg eventually won out, though something of a compromise was reached by having Tony refer to Fievel as &quot;Filly&quot;. Spielberg also had some material cut that he felt was too intense for children, including a scene Bluth was developing revolving around wave monsters while the family was at sea.

=== Casting ===
Bluth described the process of voice casting as &quot;sometimes you can select a &#x27;name&#x27; voice [i.e., a well-known actor] because it fits the essence of the character so well. Other times, you need to seek an obscure voice, close your eyes, and just listen to it. If it has the highs and lows in the deliverance of lines and it captures the focus of the character, it allows the animators to get a true fix on the action&quot;: 
* Glasser (Fievel) was discovered by accident when Bluth and his crew overheard him auditioning for an Oscar Mayer commercial. 
* Green (Tanya Mousekewitz) was a young actress who had done some previous television series work and several commercials. 
* Persoff, a respected actor in many films, was chosen to play the part of Papa Mousekewitz mostly because he had a similar role as Barbra Streisand&#x27;s father in &quot;Yentl&quot;. 
* Yohn (Mama Mousekewitz) has appeared in many features, but her work as a Russian Rom on a TV show attracted the attention of Bluth and John Pomeroy. 
* Finnegan won the role of Warren T. Rat by reciting excerpts of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the voice of a Brooklyn taxi driver. This idea inspired the writers to make Warren a pretentious illiterate who continually misquoted Shakespeare. 
* Musick (Tony Toponi) based Tony&#x27;s voice on a friend she knew from grade school. 
* DeLuise (Tiger) had worked previously with Bluth in &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, and DeLuise even added material to the script at various points. During the song &quot;A Duo&quot;, he suggested they stop the music where the lyrics mention &quot;back scratch&quot; and have Fievel actually scratch Tiger&#x27;s back. 
* Henri was originally to be voiced by comedian Sid Caesar, and was conceived as scraggly and worn, but later Plummer was cast for the part and Henri was drawn with a more dignified look. Bluth felt Henri was an essential character to act as a voice for the statue &quot;welcoming&quot; Fievel to the new world.
* Kahn was chosen to play the part of Gussie Mausheimer with the hopes that she would use a voice similar to the one she used as a character in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, with the character being written as German American for such.

Will Ryan (Digit), Neil Ross (Honest John), Cathianne Blore (Bridget), and Hal Smith (Moe) are all voice actors well known in the animation industry.

=== Design ===
In designing the look of the film and its characters, Bluth worked with Amblin Entertainment and the Sears marketing department (Sears had a major marketing push on the main character). He decided to make a stylistic shift from the more angular &quot;modern style&quot; of animation of the time to a style similar to Disney animation from the 1940s, where the characters have a softer and cuddlier feel. This proved successful, and at release many critics praised the &quot;old fashioned style&quot; of the film&#x27;s look and feel. This was during a period when the market for nostalgia was particularly strong among baby boomers, who at this time were seeking products for their young children, and only three years before the beginning of the Disney Renaissance for the studio Bluth once worked for.

=== Animation ===
Bluth preferred to storyboard an entire picture, but it soon proved to be an enormous task. Larry Leker was brought in to assist, turning Bluth&#x27;s rough sketches into final storyboard panels. Bluth commented that he would then &quot;send them over to [Spielberg]. Often I brought them over myself, so that I could explain them. Steven would get very excited by what he saw, and we&#x27;d edit the boards right there...adding more drawings, or trimming some back&quot;. A large crew of animators was pulled together from around the world, utilizing cel painters in Ireland. Discussion arose about moving the entire production to Ireland, but Spielberg balked at the idea of a story called &quot;An American Tail&quot; being produced overseas.

At this time, Bluth and his crew discovered that using a video printer greatly increased their productivity. They could videotape an action, then print out small black and white thermal images from the tape for reference for both human and animal characters, a shorthand method similar to the rotoscoping technique (called in fact xerography) used since the earliest days of animation, in which sequences are shot in live action and traced onto animation cels. They also utilized the process of building models and photographing them, particularly the ship at sea, and the &quot;Giant Mouse of Minsk&quot;, a technique also used in many Disney films.

=== Production difficulties ===
During production, Amblin and Universal expected to view the dailies and approve all major work on the film, and various outside parties also requested changes here and there. The production buckled under the excessive oversight, and Bluth felt that he was losing freedom of control over the production process. As the release deadline approached, pressure grew among the crew and numerous problems arose, ranging from slower-than-expected cel painting in Ireland to low footage output by some animators. Also, the songwriters had written the score much later than originally desired. Suddenly scenes had to be dropped to save time and money and new, shorter scenes had to be created to help pick up the story points lost in the process, sometimes making the story line look jumbled. Notable cuts include the Mousekewitzes&#x27; journey across Europe, a scene in which they first meet Tiger, and he gets stuck up in a tree, an upbeat song that Fievel was planned to sing while imprisoned in the sweatshop, and a scene that gave greater explanation of the changing of names at Ellis Island. Cuts are also responsible for baby Yasha&#x27;s apparent disappearance after the boat trip.

The film was also plagued by union difficulties. Bluth had agreed to accept $6.5 million to get it produced (which later grew to $9 million), at a time when Disney was spending around $12 million per film. He knew it would be difficult, but felt it was worth the sacrifice to work with Spielberg on a major project. With the agreement of his employees, salaries were frozen for a year and half. Unlike the former Bluth studios, the new Sullivan Bluth studios were non-union, and when many workers attempted to withdraw from the union, it sparked a battle between Bluth and the union that continued through most of the production. It was mostly this struggle that later compelled Bluth to relocate to Ireland, which he felt offered a more supportive atmosphere.

== Music ==


Spielberg&#x27;s original vision for the film was as a musical. It is said he wanted a &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; of his own (referring to the popular song from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;). Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked on &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; with Bluth was initially supposed to work on the score but had to drop out of the film due to a busy schedule. After he completed &quot;Aliens&quot;, James Horner composed the score for the film, which was recorded in England and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and the Choir of King&#x27;s College. Two excerpts of period music also appear in the film: &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; by John Philip Sousa and &quot;Poor Wand&#x27;ring One&quot; from the 1880 comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan. There is also a musical reference to the 1947 song &quot;Galway Bay&quot; popularized by Bing Crosby, and &quot;Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor&quot; is a choral interpretation of a portion of Emma Lazarus&#x27;s sonnet &quot;The New Colossus&quot;. Initially, Bluth and his team were disappointed with the first score recording, but once edited, they found the music worked quite well. The final score became one of the film&#x27;s strongest points.

The initial songs were written by Tom Bahler, who had worked as a music supervisor and composer. Bahler left the project, in which Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann were later brought on to compose new songs, collaborating with Horner. After the first round of songs were written, it was decided a special song would be written for Linda Ronstadt to sing over the end credits with James Ingram. Titled &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, it later went on to win two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. It would become one of the most popular songs from an animated feature since the 1950s.

An official soundtrack containing 14 tracks from the film was first released on November 21, 1986, by MCA Records, and was made available on audio cassette, vinyl record, and CD. It was later released digitally by Geffen Records on February 5, 2013.

===Songs===
Original songs &amp; scores performed in the film include:
All songs are composed by James Horner and Barry Mann with lyrics written by Cynthia Weil; all scores are composed by Horner

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Box office ===
The film has grossed up to $47 million in the United States and Canada, and $84 million worldwide. At the time of its domestic release, it became the highest-grossing animated feature for an initial release and the highest-grossing non-Disney produced animated feature. It was also one of the first animated films to outdraw a Disney one, beating out &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (another traditionally animated film involving mice that was released in 1986 but four months earlier) by over US$22 million, but &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; was more successful with critics, most notably Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. The inexpensive success of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; played a large role in the Disney Renaissance; because it was both a critical and financial success, which saved Walt Disney Animation Studios from going bankrupt after &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; had flopped at the box office a year earlier. It would later be outgrossed by Bluth&#x27;s next film, 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, which marginally outperformed &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; although the latter did beat out former at the domestic box office by $5,000,000.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 77% approval rating based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The consensus is: &quot;Exquisitely animated, &quot;An American Tail&quot; is a sweet, melancholy immigrants story&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 38% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave it &quot;two thumbs down&quot; on a November 22, 1986, episode of their television program &quot;At the Movies&quot;, calling it &quot;the most downbeat children&#x27;s movie since &quot;Return to Oz&quot;&quot;, and that it was &quot;way too depressing for young audiences&quot;. Both reviewers also criticized how it gave little mention that the main characters were Jewish, or that the attack on their home at the beginning was an antisemitic one. They called it &quot;a Jewish parable that doesn&#x27;t want to declare itself&quot; and felt that it &quot;chickened out on its ethnic heritage&quot;. In his own review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave it two stars out of four, giving credit to the animation, calling it &quot;full and detailed, enhanced by computers and an improvement on so much recent animation that cuts corners&quot;, but that the story was too &quot;dark and gloomy&quot;.

The film&#x27;s writing garnered a mixed response. &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; claimed it didn&#x27;t have &quot;much in the way of narrative interest or indeed humor&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;witless if well-meaning&quot;, adding that its high points were scenes involving the characters Gussie Mausheimer and Tiger. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Pat Graham panned its &quot;flimsy characterizations&quot; but said that &quot;the overall quality of the animation—baroquely executed if rather conventionally conceived—makes it worth a look&quot;. Common Sense Media gave it largely positive reviews, commenting that &quot;this is a heartwarming animated tale about the experience of immigrants coming to America. Told from the perspective of an adorable young mouse, &quot;An American Tail&quot; should engage kids in an important part of U.S. history&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a bright-eyed tale of Jewish triumphs that will find a place in many young hearts&quot;, adding that &quot;it reiterates the happiness of homogeneity, prepares the pups for both brotherhood and the free enterprise system. And it&#x27;s as pretty as a cascade of soap bubbles&quot;.

Roger Harlburt, reviewing for the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, also praised the character of Fievel: &quot;You&#x27;ll discover in gentle Fievel a endearing character that manages to be lovable without undue sentiment. His eyes may tear up once in a while and his lower lip quiver, but mostly he&#x27;s ready to face the situation. Still, the superb animation makes you believe Fievel is a small boy lost in a big world&quot;. Harlburt later summarized: &quot;Laced with action scenes and peppered with amusing dialogue, the film moves along briskly. Little ones won&#x27;t be bored. Original songs – including &quot;Never Say Never&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re a Duo&quot; – are also entertaining. You&#x27;ll marvel over the quality of Plummer&#x27;s singing voice and be convulsed by DeLuise&#x27;s feline antics&quot;.

== Media ==
=== Home media ===
In September 1987, &quot;An American Tail&quot; was first released on VHS and became one of MCA Home Video&#x27;s biggest sellers with sales of 1.4 million. It was later released on LaserDisc in both regular and CAV play editions in November 1991 by MCA Universal Home Video in North America, and CIC Video internationally. On August 11, 1998, both the film and its sequel &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; were digitally restored and re-released onto VHS in a 2-pack box set with both videos having clamshell cases. A DVD version was first made available on January 20, 2004, by Universal Studios, which was presented in fullscreen aspect ratio only, and contained a number of changes from earlier versions, including re-dubbing certain character&#x27;s voices in the Orphan Alley scene, the addition of new voices where there was previously no dialog, and new &quot;humorous&quot; sound effects. This version was reprinted along with other Universal films such as its sequel, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, and &quot;Balto&quot;. It was released in widescreen on Blu-ray for the first time on March 4, 2014, which included a digital HD and UltraViolet copy. It had the same changes as the DVD, although part of the film&#x27;s end credits music score was 9% sped-up this time (due to time constrictions). A re-release of the fullscreen DVD version with new cover artwork followed on February 3, 2015. All four &quot;American Tail&quot; films were re-released on a combination pack DVD released on June 13, 2017. That release marked the first widescreen debut of the first two films on a Region 1 DVD.

== Sequels and legacy ==

The film gave rise to a number of follow-up media, of which Don Bluth had no direct involvement. The theatrical sequel &quot;Fievel Goes West&quot;, directed by Phil Nibbelink and Simon Wells and produced by Steven Spielberg and Robert Watts, was released in 1991 and follows the adventures of Fievel and his family as they move from New York to the Wild West. A 13-episode TV series based on it called &quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot; aired on the CBS network between September and December 1992. Two direct-to-video films were also later produced by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment: &quot;The Treasure of Manhattan Island&quot; in 1998, and &quot;The Mystery of the Night Monster&quot; in 1999. The Mousekewitz family would also be parodied, somewhat, as a family of Italian American fleas in a few episodes of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, also produced by Steven Spielberg.

A video game based on this film was released for PlayStation 2 only in Europe in 2007 by Data Design Interactive.

Fievel would also serve as the mascot for Spielberg&#x27;s Amblimation animation production company in London, England, appearing in its production logo until the studio&#x27;s replacement by DreamWorks Animation in 1997. In March 2000, Fievel became the official children&#x27;s spokesman for UNICEF, with the organization&#x27;s director of communications Craig Kornblau remarking that &quot;Fievel Mousekewitz is a popular endearing character for children everywhere&quot; and &quot;his immigration experiences reflect the adventures and triumphs of all cultures and their children&quot;.

Children&#x27;s Theatre Company in Minneapolis has adapted the film into a stage musical, which made its world premiere on April 25, 2023. &quot;An American Tail the Musical&quot; features book and lyrics by playwright Itamar Moses, music and lyrics by Michael Mahler and Alan Schmuckler, and directed by Taibi Magar. The show is choreographed by Katie Spelman.

== Alleged plagiarism ==
Art Spiegelman accused Spielberg of plagiarism because the Jews are depicted as mice in the film, just as in Spiegelman&#x27;s earlier &quot;Maus&quot;, a metaphor he had adopted from Nazi propaganda. Instead of pursuing copyright litigation, he opted to beat its release date by convincing his publishers to split &quot;Maus&quot; into two volumes and publish the first before he even finished the second.

<text>The Special Olympics World Games, also known as Special Olympiad, are an international sporting event for participants with intellectual disabilities, organized by the IOC-recognised Special Olympics organization.

== Principles ==

Although local Special Olympics events and competitions are held around the world every day, the World Games are flagship events. The goal is to showcase the skills and accomplishments of people with intellectual disabilities on a global stage. The World Games feature more than a week of competitions involving thousands of athletes. Through media coverage of the Games, the stories and achievements of children and adults with intellectual disabilities are made known to millions of people worldwide.

Special Olympics World Games take place every two years and alternate between Summer and Winter Games, a schedule similar to the Olympics and Paralympics. Attracting as many as 350,000 volunteers and coaches, plus several thousands of athletes, these World Games can be the world&#x27;s largest sporting event of the year.

Special Olympics athletes can compete in 32 Olympic-style summer or winter sports. The athletes are adults and children with intellectual disabilities who can range from gifted, world-class competitors to average athletes to those with limited physical ability. In Special Olympics competitions, athletes are matched up according to their ability and age. This “divisioning” process is an effort to make every competition fair, competitive and exciting for athletes as well as fans.

== History ==
The first International Special Olympics Summer Games were held in Chicago, Illinois, US, in 1968, while the first International Special Olympics Winter Games were held in February 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, US. In 1991, the name was officially changed from International Special Olympics Summer/Winter Games to Special Olympics World Summer/Winter Games.

The 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games received more than half of its funding from private corporations. Olympic historian Bob Barney stated &quot;companies that donate millions might want say in how an event is run&quot;, but also felt it positive since &quot;it brings the games to a much larger viewing audience&quot;.

In 2011, Special Olympics World Summer Games were held on June 25 – July 4 in Athens, Greece, involving 6,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 170 countries.

In 2013, the Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in PyeongChang, South Korea from Jan. 29 – Feb. 5. The Host Town program, in which families host Special Olympics athletes from around the world to help them acclimate to the host country and customs, began on Jan. 26, 2013.

In 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games . These games were the first Special Olympics World Summer Games held in the United States in 16 years since the 1999 Summer Games held in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Graz and Schladming in Styria, Austria. This marked a return: Salzburg and Schladming, Austria hosted the fifth Special Olympics World Winter Games in 1993. These were the first Special Olympics World Games held outside the United States. The 2017 World Winter Games were held on March 14–25, 2017.

Kazan, Russia was due to host the Winter Special Olympics between January 23–29, 2023. Originally to be held in Åre and Östersund, Sweden however the Swedish Government withdrew its hosting rights in December 2019 due to financial problems. The event had been postponed to January 2023 due a rise of COVID-19 cases. Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the event was cancelled due to logistical and safety issues.

The more recent Special Olympics World Summer Games were held June 17–25, 2023 in Berlin, Germany. These were the first Special Olympics World Games to be held in Germany. Competitions were held in 24 sports.

Turin, Italy will host the next World Winter Games in March 2025. It will mark the first time that Italy has hosted the Special Olympics World Games.

Santiago, Chile will host the next World Summer Games in 2027. It will mark the first time the Special Olympics World Games will be staged in the Southern Hemisphere. It will also be the first time it will be held in Latin America and a Spanish speaking country.

1 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was originally selected to host the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games. Due to financial problems and the constant delay in reconstruction of the venues that originally hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, Sarajevo gave up hosting the Special Olympics and Boise, Idaho, was invited to host instead.

2 It was planned that Åre and Östersund, Sweden, would host the 2021 World Winter Games between February 2 to 13, 2021. However, on December 20, 2019, it was announced that the Swedish Paralympic Committee vetoed the necessary financing for the continuity of the event in the country, invalidating a promise made during the bid process. On June 29, 2020, it was announced that Kazan would host the Winter Games in 2022.

<text>The Reading Company ( ) was a Philadelphia-headquartered railroad that provided passenger and freight transport in eastern Pennsylvania and neighboring states from 1924 until its acquisition by Conrail in 1976.

Commonly called the Reading Railroad and logotyped as Reading Lines, the Reading Company was a railroad holding company for most of its existence, and a single railroad in its later years. It operated service as Reading Railway System and was a successor to the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company, founded in 1833.

Until the decline in anthracite shipments from the Coal Region in Northeastern Pennsylvania following World War II, it was one of the most prosperous corporations in the United States. Enactment of the federally-funded Interstate Highway System in 1956 led to competition from the modern trucking industry. They used the Interstates for short-distance transportation of goods, which compounded the company&#x27;s competition for freight business, forcing it into bankruptcy in 1971.

In 1976, its railroad operations merged into Conrail, and the remainder of the corporation was renamed Reading International.

==History==
===Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road: 1833–1893===
The Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road (P&amp;R) was one of the first railroads in the United States. Along with the Little Schuylkill, a horse-drawn railroad in the Schuylkill River Valley, it formed the earliest components of what became the Reading Company. The P&amp;R was constructed initially to haul anthracite coal from the mines of the Coal Region in Northeastern Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. The original P&amp;R mainline extended south from the mining town of Pottsville to Reading and then to Philadelphia. The right of way needed only gentle grading to follow the banks of the Schuylkill River for nearly all of the 93-mile (150-km) journey. From its founding in 1843, the original Reading mainline was a double track line.

The P&amp;R became profitable almost immediately. Energy-dense coal, known as anthracite, had been replacing increasingly scarce wood as fuel in businesses and homes since the 1810s, and P&amp;R-delivered coal was one of the first alternatives to the near monopoly held by Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company since the 1820s. The P&amp;R bought or leased many of the railroads in the Schuylkill River Valley and extended westward and north along the Susquehanna River into the southern portion of the Coal Region.

In Philadelphia, the Reading built Port Richmond, the self-proclaimed &quot;largest privately-owned railroad tidewater terminal in the world&quot;, which burnished the P&amp;R&#x27;s bottom lines by allowing anthracite coal to be loaded onto ships and barges for export. In 1871, the Reading established a subsidiary, the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, which set about buying anthracite coal mines throughout the Coal Region.

This vertical expansion gave the P&amp;R almost full control of the region&#x27;s anthracite coal market, including both its mining and transport, allowing it to compete successfully with competitors such as the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company and the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.

The company&#x27;s heavy investment in anthracite coal paid off quickly. By 1871, the Reading was the largest company in the world with $170,000,000 in market capitalization (equal to $ today). It may have been the first conglomerate in the world. 

In 1879, the Reading gained control of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, which provided access to the burgeoning steel industry in the Lehigh Valley.

The Reading further expanded its coal empire into New York City by gaining control of the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad in 1879, and building the Port Reading Branch in 1892 with a line from Port Reading Junction to Port Reading, New Jersey on the Arthur Kill. This allowed direct delivery of coal to industries to the Port of New York and New Jersey in North Jersey and New York City by rail and barge instead of the longer trip by ships from Port Richmond around Cape May.
Instead of broadening its rail network, the Reading invested its vast wealth in anthracite and its transportation in the mid-19th century. In 1890, however, Reading president Archibald A. McLeod concluded that expanding the company&#x27;s rail network and becoming a trunk railroad would prove more lucrative than anthracite mining.

The following year, in 1891, McLeod began attempting to seize control of neighboring railroads and successfully gained control of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey, and the Boston and Maine Railroad. The Reading almost achieved its goal of becoming a trunk railroad, but the deal was scuttled by J. P. Morgan and other rail barons who did not want more competition in the northeastern railroad business. The Reading was relegated to being a regional railroad for the rest of its history.

====1833–1873: General Expansion====
The Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road was chartered on April 4, 1833, to build a line along the Schuylkill River between Philadelphia and Reading. The portion from Reading to Norristown opened July 16, 1838, and the full line opened December 9, 1839. Its Philadelphia terminus was at the state-owned Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad (P&amp;C) on the west side of the Schuylkill River from where it ran east on the P&amp;C over the Columbia Bridge and onto the city-owned City Railroad to a depot at the southeast corner of Broad and Cherry Streets in Center City Philadelphia.

An extension northwest from Reading to Mount Carbon, also on the Schuylkill River, opened on January 13, 1842, allowing the railroad to compete with the Schuylkill Canal. At Mount Carbon, it connected with the earlier Mount Carbon Railroad, continuing through Pottsville to several mines, and would eventually be extended to Williamsport. On May 17, 1842, a freight branch from West Falls to Port Richmond on the Delaware River north of downtown Philadelphia opened. Port Richmond later became a very large coal terminal.

On January 1, 1851, the Belmont Plane on the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, just west of the Reading&#x27;s connection, was abandoned in favor of a new bypass, and the portion of the line east of it was sold to the Reading, the only company that continued using the old route.

The Lebanon Valley Railroad was chartered in 1836 to build from Reading west to Harrisburg. Reading financed the construction of the Rutherford Yard to compete with the PRR&#x27;s nearby Enola Yard. The Reading took it over and began construction in 1854, opening the line in 1856. This gave the Reading a route from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, for the first time to compete directly with the Pennsylvania Railroad, which became its major rival.

In 1859, the Reading leased the Chester Valley Railroad, providing a branch from Bridgeport west to Downingtown. It had formerly been operated by the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad.

A new Philadelphia terminal opened on December 24, 1859, at Broad and Callowhill Streets, north of the old one at Cherry Street. The Reading and Columbia Railroad was chartered in 1857 to build from Reading southwest to Columbia on the Susquehanna River. It opened in 1864, using the Lebanon Valley Railroad from Sinking Spring east to Reading. The Reading leased it in 1870.

The early Philadelphia and Reading Railroad named all of its locomotives with names such as &quot;Winona&quot; or &quot;Jefferson&quot;, as did most American railroads following in the British precedent, but in December 1871 the P&amp;R replaced all the names with numbers. The Port Kennedy Railroad, a short branch to quarries at Port Kennedy, was leased in 1870. Also that year, the Reading leased the Pickering Valley Railroad, a branch running west from Phoenixville to Byers, Pennsylvania, which opened in 1871.

On December 1, 1870, the Reading leased the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad, thereby gaining that company&#x27;s route along the east bank of the Schuylkill from Philadelphia to Norristown, as well as its branch to Chestnut Hill.

=====1873: Chester Branch=====
In 1873, the P&amp;R extended its reach southward by leasing 10.2 miles of track from the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. Dubbed the Philadelphia &amp; Chester Branch, the line extended from the Gray&#x27;s Ferry Bridge across the Schuylkill River in West Philadelphia to Ridley Creek in Ridley Park in Delaware County. The segment included 4.9 miles of double track and 16.7 miles of single track, including sidings and turnouts.

The segment was part of the original 1838 line of the PW&amp;B, which in 1872 opened a new stretch of track further inland to serve more populated areas and reduce flooding. On July 1, 1873, the PW&amp;B agreed to lease the freight rights to the P&amp;R for &quot;$350,000 payable at the time the lease was made and $1 a year
thereafter&quot; for a term of 999 years with the stipulation that no passenger trains would use it. The Reading dubbed the line, along with some connecting track, its Philadelphia and Chester Branch; southbound trains reached it via the Junction Railroad, jointly controlled by PW&amp;B, Reading, and PRR, and continued on to the connecting Chester and Delaware River Railroad.

====1875–1893: Competition====

During 1875, four members of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad board of directors resigned to build a second railroad from Camden, New Jersey, to Atlantic City by way of Clementon. Led by Samuel Richards, an officer of the C&amp;A for 24 years, they established the Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railway (P&amp;AC) on March 24, 1876. A 3-foot-6-inch narrow gauge was selected because it would lower track laying and operating costs. Work began in April 1877, and the track work was completed in a remarkable 90 days.

On July 7, 1877, the final spike was driven and the line was opened in time for the summer tourism season. However, on July 12, 1878, the P&amp;AC Railway slipped into bankruptcy; on September 20, 1883, it was jointly acquired by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway for $1 million. The name was changed to Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railroad on December 4, 1883. The first major task was to convert all track to standard gauge, which was completed on October 5, 1884. The Philadelphia and Reading Railway acquired full control on December 4, 1885.

The Reading leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad on May 14, 1879. This gave it a line from Philadelphia north to Bethlehem, and also the valuable Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad, the descendant of the National Railway project, providing a route to New York City in direct competition with the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company. At the New York end, it used the Central Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Jersey City Terminal from which passengers could board ferries to Liberty Street Ferry Terminal, Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal, and West 23rd Street in Lower Manhattan.

The Reading Terminal opened in Philadelphia in 1893. On May 29 the Reading leased the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The Reading eventually bought a majority of the CNJ&#x27;s stock in 1901.

On April 1, 1889, the Philadelphia and Reading Railway consolidated the Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railway, Williamstown &amp; Delaware River Railroad, Glassboro Railroad, Camden, Gloucester and Mt. Ephraim Railway, and the Kaighn&#x27;s Point Terminal Railroad in southern New Jersey into The Atlantic City Railroad. The Port Reading Railroad was chartered in 1890 and opened in 1892, running east from a junction from the New York main line near Bound Brook to the Port Reading on the Arthur Kill near Perth Amboy.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad was leased on December 1, 1891, under the presidency of Archibald A. McLeod, but that lease was canceled on August 8, 1893, when the Reading went into receivership, an event associated with the Panic of 1893. The Reading also relinquished control of the Central New England Railway and the Boston and Maine Railroad. Amid the turmoil of the Panic of 1893, Joseph Smith Harris was elected president. Under his leadership, the Reading Company was formed and the P&amp;R was absorbed into it on November 30. Also in 1893, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad built its most famous structure, Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, which served as the terminus for most of its Philadelphia-bound trains, and also the company&#x27;s headquarters.

==== 1877: Reading Railroad Massacre ====
On July 22, 1877, after the crushing of strikes and unions by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, and following in the path of the Great Railroad Strikes of 1877, vandalism of the Reading&#x27;s financial interests in Reading, Pennsylvania began. The subsidiary that owned mining interests in the area, the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, not the government, called up militia and Coal and Iron Police to put down riots and protests that had broken out in the city. After the militia and Coal and Iron Police went to retrieve a train carrying coal that was blocked in a railroad cut, they fired on rioters and protesters, killing at least 10 and wounding more than 40.

===Philadelphia and Reading Railway: 1896–1923===
After the Panic of 1893, and the failure of Archibald A. McLeod&#x27;s efforts to turn the Reading into a major trunk line, the Reading was forced to reorganize under suspicions of monopoly. The Reading Company was created to serve as a holding company for the Reading&#x27;s rail and coal subsidiaries: the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, and the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, respectively. However, in 1906, with the support of the Roosevelt Administration, the Hepburn Act was passed. This required all railroads to disinvest themselves of all mining properties and operations, and so the Reading Company was forced to sell the P&amp;R Coal and Iron Company.

Whether an actual monopoly or not, the company&#x27;s history as the Reading Railroad over a century ultimately became immortalized as a featured property on the original &quot;Monopoly&quot; game board.

Even though moving and mining of coal was its primary business, the P&amp;R eventually became more diversified through the development of many on-line industries, averaging almost five industries per mile of main line at one point, and the expanding role of the Reading as a bridge route.

This included its important role on the Alphabet Route, from Boston and New York City to Chicago with traffic from the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey entering the Reading System in Allentown, traveling over the East Penn Branch to Reading, where trains then traveled west over the Lebanon Valley Branch to Harrisburg and then onward over the Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh branch, or PH&amp;P to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania where trains connected with the Western Maryland Railroad to continue westward. This route became known as the Crossline, and the Reading started to pool locomotive power between its connecting railroads to provide a more seamless transfer of freight and passengers.

Even though the Reading was never again to regain its powerful position of the 1870s, it still was a very profitable and important railroad. From the turn of the 20th century to the outbreak of World War I, the Reading was among the most modern and efficient railroads. In keeping with the standards of much larger railroads, The Reading embarked on many improvement projects which typically were not attempted by smaller railroads. This included triple and quadruple tracking many of its major routes, improving signaling and track quality, as well as expanding system capacity and station facilities.

The Reading invested in the construction of new cut-offs, bypasses and connections, much like the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s low-grade lines and the Lackawanna Cut-off. The completion of the Reading belt line in 1902, a 7.2-mile westerly bypass of downtown Reading, alleviated the heavy rail congestion in the busy city.

In Bridgeport, a new bridge was constructed over the Schuylkill River in 1903. The bridge connected the P&amp;R main line on the west (south) bank of the river with the Manayunk/Norristown Line on the opposite side, allowing passenger service to Norristown and a bypass of the old main line, known as the West Side Freight line.

The Ninth Street Branch—the main thoroughfare into Reading Terminal—was also improved. Between 1907 and 1914 the old double-track and street-level route was replaced by an elevated quadruple-track route that offered greater capacity and safety. In 1901, the Reading gained a controlling interest in the Central Railroad of New Jersey, allowing the Reading to offer seamless, one-seat rides from Reading Terminal in Philadelphia to the Central New Jersey&#x27;s Jersey City Communipaw Terminal by way of Bound Brook onto the Central New Jersey mainline. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was also looking for access to the New York City market, and in 1903 it gained control over the Reading and ensured track rights over the Reading and Central New Jersey to Jersey City.

To the north, the New York Short Line was completed in 1906, and was a cut-off for New York City-bound trains through freights and the Baltimore and Ohio&#x27;s Royal Blue.

====Reading Shops====
The first locomotive and car repair shops were built in 1850 at Reading, Pennsylvania, consisting of two enclosed roundhouses and a machine shop. In 1902, the Reading Shops were materially expanded and overhauled into new property on the north side along the Reading yards and North 6th Street, facilitating the maintenance and construction of a greater locomotive and rolling stock fleet. The shops were completed four years later; with their imposing brick architecture, they were among the largest railroad shops in the US. Unlike most railroads, the Reading Shops were able to fabricate locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars in addition to regular overhauls and repairs. The locomotive department employed an average of 2,000 workers, featuring a machine shop containing 70 erecting pits, while the car department employed an additional 1,000. Other car shops were kept busy at Wayne Junction (Philadelphia), St. Clair/Pottsville, Tamaqua, Newberry Junction (Williamsport), and Rutherford, outside of Harrisburg. Most of the former Reading shops still stand today in non-railroad use.

Larger steam locomotives were introduced to haul the increasing traffic, including the massive N1 class 2-8-8-2 (Chesapeake) Mallet, and Reading made one M1 class 2-8-2 freight hauler; Baldwin Locomotive Works built the rest. Big freight haulers were the massive K-1 2-10-2 locomotives; some were built in Reading from the Mallets; others were built by Baldwin. The G1 class 4-6-2 were passenger locomotives. These classes were an important break of tradition of the Reading&#x27;s motive power fleet.

The M1s were the first Reading locomotives to include a trailing truck, and the first engine with the cab behind the Wootten firebox. Engines with the name &quot;lessor&quot; in its title meant some steam power was owned by a second party and leased to the P&amp;R. The G1s were the first Reading passenger locomotives with three-coupled driving wheels.

Between 1945 and 1947, the company took 30 class I-10 2-8-0 locomotives and rebuilt them at the 6th Street facility into the modern T1 class 4-8-4 locomotives for 6 million dollars. This was a move to offset the fact that EMD FT diesel locomotives (the first choice of Reading management) were very hard to obtain, but the Reading needed faster, up-to-date modern power. The steamers never ran long enough to pay back this major investment, and had some major problems, but it did keep men employed. As of 2023, four examples have survived, and the 2102 is in active tourist service with the Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad. The Reading built or bought numerous smaller 4-4-0s, 2-8-0s and switchers for its fleet.

====Passenger operations====

The Reading Company did not operate extensive long-distance passenger train service, but it did field several named trains, most famous of which was the streamlined &quot;Crusader&quot;, which connected Philadelphia and Jersey City, New Jersey.

Other trains in the fleet included the &quot;Harrisburg Special&quot; (between Jersey City and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania), &quot;King Coal&quot; (between Philadelphia and Shamokin, Pennsylvania), &quot;North Penn&quot; (between Philadelphia and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), &quot;Queen of the Valley&quot; (between Jersey City and Harrisburg), &quot;Schuylkill&quot; (between Philadelphia and Pottsville, Pennsylvania), and &quot;Wall Street&quot; (between Philadelphia and Jersey City). The Reading participated in the joint operation of &quot;The Interstate Express&quot; with the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad, with service between Philadelphia and Syracuse, New York.

Reading also offered through passenger car service with the Lehigh Valley Railroad via their connection at Bethlehem. Like most railroads, the Reading had contracts with the U.S. Post Office to haul and sort mail en route. After World War II, the Reading looked at dropping the mail and in 1961 notified the government that it intended to stop mail service on its passenger trains. On July 1, 1963, the post office let them out of the contracts, which were valued at $2,137,000, equal to $ today, and the railroad switched to Budd RDC self-propelled cars, instead of locomotive hauled passenger trains, to save money.
Camden-Atlantic City speed: On July 20, 1904, regularly-scheduled train no. 25, running from Kaighn&#x27;s Point in Camden, New Jersey to Atlantic City with Philadelphia and Reading Railway class P-4c 4-4-2 (Atlantic class cab over boiler) locomotive No.334 and 5 passenger cars, set a speed record. It ran the 55.5 miles in 43 minutes at an average speed of 77.4 mph. The 29.3 miles between Winslow Jct and Meadows Tower (outside of Atlantic City) were covered in 20 minutes at a speed of 87.9 mph. During the short segment between Egg Harbor and Brigantine Junction, the train was reported to have reached 115 mph.

The Reading operated an extensive commuter network out of Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. In the late 1920s, most of the suburban system was electrified (the first lines electrified were the Ninth Street Branch, New Hope Branch as far as the Hatboro station and extended to Warminster station in 1974, the Bethlehem Branch as far as Lansdale, the Doylestown Branch, and the New York Branch to West Trenton). Reading ordered 150 electric multiple units from Bethlehem Steel which were supplemented by twenty unpowered coach trailers converted from existing coaches and electrified services began on July 26, 1931.

===Reading Company: 1924–1976===

After the First World War with the release of the Reading from government control, they decided to streamline their corporate structure. For twenty years the Reading Company, the holding company created for the P&amp;R and the P&amp;R Coal and Iron Company, only controlled the P&amp;R after the sale of the P&amp;R Coal and Iron Company. To simplify corporate structure, the P&amp;R ceased operation in 1924 and the Reading Company took over operating the railroad.

The period just after World War I may have been the Reading Company&#x27;s best with traffic on the Reading at its peacetime high. Annual volume was about 15 million tons of anthracite, 25 million tons of bituminous coal with a further 30 million tons of industrial traffic. The Reading had taken great strides to wean itself of anthracite dependency but it still relied heavily on coal revenue, and Pennsylvania anthracite production had peaked in 1917 with 99.7 million tons produced.


The 1925 &quot;Reading&quot; totals above include all the subsidiaries (C&amp;F, G&amp;H, P&amp;CV etc.) that were operating roads in 1925 but whose totals were included in Reading&#x27;s after 1929. None of the totals include Atlantic City RR or PRSL.

====Commuter lines====

In the 1920s, the Reading operated a dense network of commuter lines branching off of the Ninth Street Branch mostly powered by small 4-4-0s, 4-4-2s and 4-6-0 camelbacks.

====Bankruptcy protection====
The Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues, freight being diverted to highways by trucking companies, and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set prices, imposed high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing lines as a common carrier.

====Electrification====
The railroad also had an extensive commuter operation centered around Philadelphia, the hub of which was Reading Terminal. The following suburban lines were electrified during the onset of the Great Depression:
*Norristown Line
*Chestnut Hill
*Lansdale/Doylestown
*Hatboro (extended to Warminster in 1974)
*West Trenton

The notable exception was the Fox Chase/Newtown branch. With the aid of public funding from the city of Philadelphia, the line was electrified as far as Fox Chase (the last station within city limits) in September 1966.

Electrification was to be completed through to Newtown in the 1970s, but government subsidies were not readily available, leaving the Fox Chase-Newtown section as the lone non-electrified suburban commuter route on the Reading system. Passenger service between Fox Chase and Newtown was terminated on January 14, 1983, under the auspices of SEPTA.

To further complicate matters, the Reading was forced to continue paying its debts to the Penn Central Railroad, however, Penn Central (also in bankruptcy at the time) was not required to pay its debts to the Reading Company.

===Post-railroad: 1976–present===
On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its railroad assets to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail), leaving it with 650 real estate assets, some coal properties, and 52 abandoned rights-of-way. As of 1999, most former Reading lines are now part of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), as a result of the Conrail split between NS and CSX Transportation. It had sold 350 of the real estate tracts by the time it left bankruptcy in 1980.

In the late 1980s, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, James Cotter, gained control of the corporation through his holding company, the Craig Corporation, and used its assets to finance his movie theater chains in Puerto Rico, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1991, the company sold one of its last railroad-related assets, the Reading Terminal Headhouse. Five years later, in 1996, Cotter reorganized the company as Reading Entertainment. On December 31, 2001, both Reading Entertainment and Craig Corporation merged into and with Citadel Holding Corporation, another Cotter company.

The successor company was renamed Reading International Inc. with two classes of stock: Non-Voting Class A shares (NASDAQ: RDI) and Voting Class B shares (NASDAQ: RDIB).

== Preserved steam locomotives ==
A total of nine steam locomotives that once served the company are still preserved.

* 0-4-0 1 &quot;Rocket&quot; - Built by the Braithwaite, Milner and Company in London in 1838. It is the oldest preserved locomotive of the railroad. It currently resides at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. 
* 4-4-0 3 &quot;Shamokin&quot; - Built by the Eastwick and Harrison Company in 1842. It is the only surviving 4-4-0 of the Reading Company. It currently resides at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.

* 0-4-0 camelback 1187 - Built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1903. It is the last surviving Reading camelback locomotive. It currently resides at the Age of Steam Roundhouse in Sugarcreek, Ohio.
* 0-6-0 tank 1251 - Built by the Reading&#x27;s own locomotive shops in 1918. It was the only tank engine to be rostered by the Reading after World War I. It currently resides at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg.
* 4-8-4 2100 - Built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1923, rebuilt by the Reading in 1945. It is the prototype engine of the Reading&#x27;s T-1 class. It currently resides at the Ex-Baltimore and Ohio roundhouse in Cleveland, where it is currently being restored to operation.
* 4-8-4 2101 - Built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1923, rebuilt by the Reading in 1945. It currently resides at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore.

===Heritage units===
As a part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2012, the company painted 20 new locomotives into predecessor schemes. NS #1067, an EMD SD70ACe locomotive, was painted into the Bee Line Service paint scheme of the Reading. In 2023, it received a fresh coating of paint.

In 2024, SEPTA unveiled two Silverliner IV heritage units, to celebrate the cars&#x27; 50th Anniversary. Numbers 280 and 293 were selected as two ex-Reading cars which were stripped bare and put back into their 1974 as-delivered Reading Company look.

<text>Duke Point is a geographical location in the extreme southeastern part of the city of Nanaimo in British Columbia. It is located on a thin peninsula to the east of the Nanaimo River estuary, just across the Northumberland Channel from Gabriola Island.

An industrial park is located at Duke Point, which includes one sawmill. The Duke Point ferry terminal is also located here, but there are no public transit connections.

==History==
Before Duke Point became an industrial park, there were searches for archaeological sites on the peninsula. Several sites were found and these examinations found that the settlements on Duke Point belonged to the Coast Salish and were around 4,000 years old. The site also revealed that Duke Point was used as a seasonal ground for the Coast Salish.

In 1980, the BC Development Corporation bought the Jack Point land from private owners, and the Duke Point land from then MacMillan Bloedel, and then levelled and serviced the lands to create the industrial park, three sawmill sites, and a 2 berth shipping terminal (only one berth was built). The 350 acre Duke Point Industrial Park was built by the BC Development Corporation from 1980 to 1983, under the Federal/Provincial Industrial Subsidiary Agreement (&quot;TIDSA&quot;). The Duke Point Ferry Terminal was built on Provincial land outside the TIDSA lands, and sits on land that was originally called &quot;Jack Point&quot;, but which was amalgamated with the Duke Point Land. Originally, the Jack Point land was separated from the Duke Point land by Canoe Pass, that connected the Northumberland Channel to the waters of the Nanaimo Estuary.

<text>Auxology (from Greek , &quot;auxō&quot;, or , &quot;auxanō&quot; &#x27;grow&#x27;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;) is a meta-term covering the study of all aspects of human physical growth. (Although, it is also fundamental of biology.) Auxology is a multi-disciplinary science involving health sciences/medicine (pediatrics, general practice, endocrinology, neuroendocrinology, physiology, epidemiology), and to a lesser extent: nutrition science, genetics, anthropology, anthropometry, ergonomics, history, economic history, economics, socio-economics, sociology, public health, and psychology, among others.

== History of auxology ==

&quot;&quot;&quot;Ancient Babylonians and Egyptians left some writings on child growth and variation in height between ethnic groups. In the late 18th century, scattered documents of child growth started to appear in the scientific literature, the studies of Jamberts in 1754 and the annual measurements of the son of Montbeillard published by Buffon in 1777 being the most cited ones [1]. Louis René Villermé (1829) was the first to realize that growth and adult height of an individual depend on the country&#x27;s socio-economic situation. In the 19th century, the number of growth studies rapidly increased, with increasing interest also in growth velocity [2]. Günther documented monthly height increments in a group of 33 boys of various ages [3]. Kotelmann [4] first noted the adolescent growth spurt. In fact, the adolescent growth spurt appears to be a novel achievement in the history of human growth and the amount and intensity of the spurt seems to be greatest in tall and affluent populations [5]. By the beginning of the 20th century, national growth tables were published for most European nations with data for height, weight, and attempts to relate weight and height, though none of these were references in the proper sense of the word as the data were usually derived from small and unrepresentative samples. After the 1930s X-ray imaging of hand and wrist became popular for determining bone age. Current auxo-logical knowledge is based on the large national studies performed in the 1950s, 1960s and the 1970s, many of them inaugurated by James Tanner [1]. In the late 1970s a new school of anthropometric history [6] emerged among historians and economists. The main aim of this school was to evaluate secular changes in conscript height during the last 100–200 years and to associate them with socio-economic changes and political events in the different countries [7]. In the 1980s and the 1990s new mathematical approaches have been added of which the LMS method has strongly been recommended for constructing modern growth reference tables [8,9]: M stands for mean, S stands for a scaling parameter, and L stands for the Box–Cox power that is required to transform the skewed data to normality. Meanwhile, many national and international growth references are based on this technology. And in view of the general idea of growth and adult height being a mirror of nutritional status, health and wealth [10], these techniques have generally been accepted for routine screening pro-grams in Public Health. Anthropometry has also been considered essential for security purposes, for the usability of industrial products, and it has become routine for car and clothing industries, for furniture, housing, and many other aspects of design in the modern environment. Growth is defined as an increase in size over time. But the rigid metric of physical time is not directly related to the tempo at which an organism develops, matures and ages. Calendar time differs in its meaning in a fast maturing and in a slow maturing organism. Fast maturing children appear tall and &quot;older&quot; than their calendar age suggests, late maturers appear &quot;too young&quot; and often short even though both may later reach the same adult size. Whereas metric scales exist for height, weight and other amplitude parameters, there are no continuous scales for maturation and developmental tempo. Instead we are used to work with substitutes like the 5-step Tanner scale for staging puberty, and age equivalents for describing bone...&quot; is an excerpt taken from Human Growth and Development by Borms, J., R. Hauspie, A. Sand, C. Susanne, and M. Hebbelinck, eds&quot;

From the taken section above we can see that ancient cultures left writings and indicators of growth from childhood into adulthood, such as the Ancient Babylonians and Egyptians. Though it wouldn&#x27;t been until the later part of the 1700s that it would appear in scientific literature in the light of the Age of Enlightenment. A movement of philosophical and scientific advancement and understanding that dominated the western world in the 18th century. As the ideals and respect of science and mathematics grew we see such men as Louis-René Villermé a physician and economist begin to take interest and realize the growth of individuals into adulthood had factors in their socio-economic situation and status. From there the study would continue to grow at a rapid rate.

Contemporaries would then catch on reaching from the interest in Growth chart which kept marks on growth velocity into more medical sided interest for public health in the sense of tracking one&#x27;s own growth and health to set standards.

== In relation to anthropology ==
As Biological anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology that provides insight into the biological/physical perspective of human beings and our ancestors, one can easily see how auxology relates to the anthropological fields. This can be seen through the study of physical human development and growth to the slight Sexual dimorphism within Human along with the maturing of the body such as the physical change from childhood into adulthood.

Auxology can also be used in the comparing of remains such as that of Neanderthal, Homo habilis and Australopithecus afarensis to any relation of Hominidae.

<doc id="973098" wikidata="Q922528" url="?curid=973098" title="Cameo (band)">
<text>Cameo is an American funk band that formed in 1974. Cameo was initially a 14-member group known as the New York City Players; this name was later changed to Cameo.

As of the first half of 2009, some of the original members continued to perform together. Two other original members were hired by the hip hop group Outkast. In 2015, Cameo announced a new residency show at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino, opening in March 2016. On February 20, 2019, Larry Blackmon of Cameo announced &quot;El Passo&quot;, the first new single from the band in 19 years.

==Career==

=== 1974–1979: Formation and early years ===
Formed by Larry Blackmon in 1974 as the New York City Players the band was signed by Casablanca Records to its Chocolate City imprint in 1975 as the Players. However, according to original band member Nathan Leftenant, the group soon changed its name after the threat of legal action by Mercury Records due to the name &quot;the Players&quot; being too similar to Ohio Players, who recorded for Mercury at the time. The name Cameo was derived from a brand of cigarettes sold in Canada that the band saw during a visit to that country. Prior to this, Blackmon, keyboardist Gregory Johnson, and Gwen Guthrie formed the band East Coast, together with James Wheeler (alto saxophone), Melvin Whay (bass), Michael Harris (percussion), and Haras Fyre (also known as Pat Grant) on trombone. They released one self-titled album in 1973 on the independent label Encounter.

Cameo started with a deep, funk sound, but it was obvious from the start their sights were set on the dance floor. Their first album was &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot; which featured its first hit single, &quot;Rigor Mortis&quot;. Follow up albums &quot;We All Know Who We Are&quot;, &quot;Ugly Ego&quot; and &quot;Secret Omen&quot; contained dance floor songs such as &quot;I Just Want to Be&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Serious&quot;, the latter of which was used for a dance contest scene in the 1978 film &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot;. The band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Find My Way&quot; was a disco song that was also used in the film, and was included on the &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; soundtrack. (&quot;Find My Way&quot; was their cover of a 1972 Three Degrees and a 1969 Tymes tune.)

Bassist Aaron Mills joined the band in 1978, after a stint in Donald Byrd&#x27;s jazz-funk collective N.C.C.U., which toured with Cameo. Mills impressed Blackmon with his bass playing, and Blackmon invited him to join Cameo.

=== 1979–1992: Mainstream breakthrough ===
The 1979 single &quot;I Just Want to Be&quot; was Cameo&#x27;s breakthrough hit. It reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and along with the follow-up single, the top 10 R&amp;B ballad &quot;Sparkle&quot;, pushed the album &quot;Secret Omen&quot; to gold status with sales of over 500,000 copies, the band&#x27;s first album to achieve this status. Their next album, &quot;Cameosis&quot;, came out in 1980 and also achieved gold status thanks in large part to the funk classic &quot;Shake Your Pants&quot;, the mid-tempo single &quot;We&#x27;re Goin&#x27; Out Tonight&quot;, and the ballad &quot;Why Have I Lost You&quot; (a re-recording of a song from their 1978 album &quot;We All Know Who We Are&quot;). It reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Their second album of 1980, &quot;Feel Me&quot;, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Knights of the Sound Table&quot; and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Alligator Woman&quot; also went gold and saw the band playing up their eclectic style. Band members Aaron Mills, Thomas &quot;TC&quot; Campbell and Jeryl Bright briefly left the band in 1983 to form a spinoff group called MCB. The band released &quot;She&#x27;s Strange&quot; in 1984, which performed well and hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s title track, eponymous single became the band&#x27;s first number 1 R&amp;B hit, as well as their first charting pop single; reaching number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

1985&#x27;s album &quot;Single Life&quot;, featuring the title track and &quot;Attack Me with Your Love&quot;, hit number 2 on the Top R&amp;B chart and continued the band&#x27;s momentum, paving the way for what was to come the following year. The single &quot;Word Up!&quot; was released in 1986 and reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, plus number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s biggest single on the pop chart. The follow-up single &quot;Candy&quot; reached number 1 R&amp;B and 21 pop, while their next release, &quot;Back and Forth&quot;, went to number 3 R&amp;B and number 50 pop. Meanwhile, the accompanying album also hit numbers 8 and 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B charts respectively, becoming their highest-charting album.

Two years later, Cameo released &quot;Machismo&quot; to mixed critical reviews and dropped to chart at numbers 10 and 56 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts respectively. Cameo then followed up with 1990&#x27;s &quot;Real Men... Wear Black&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Emotional Violence&quot;. The previous release was followed by two compilation albums in between the time of their next recording.

=== 1994–2000: Later years ===
In 1994, &quot;In the Face of Funk&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s independent label and hit 10 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. This album was then followed by a six-year unofficial hiatus with several compilation releases, until the next album &quot;Sexy Sweet Thing&quot; in 2000. The album hit 64 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and is their most recent charting release.

=== 2000–2016: Inactivity/unofficial hiatus ===
In 2001, a sample from the band&#x27;s single &quot;Candy&quot; was used in the Mariah Carey single &quot;Loverboy&quot;. The song hit number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Blackmon was given a co-songwriting credit.

These years saw a great period of inactivity and unofficial hiatus, in which time six compilation albums were released. The compilation albums released in this period were, in chronological order: &quot;The Hits Collection&quot; (2000), &quot;20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection: The Best of Cameo&quot; (2001), &quot;Anthology&quot; (2002), &quot;Classic Cameo&quot; (2003), &quot;The Best of Cameo&quot; (2004), &quot;Gold&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; (2006).

=== 2016–present: Recent years ===
In March 2016, Cameo began a year-long Las Vegas residency show at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino. In 2019, their single &quot;Candy&quot; was interpolated by Beyoncé for her cover of fellow R&amp;B group Maze&#x27;s song &quot;Before I Let Go&quot;, featured in her film and accompanying live album &quot;&quot;.

== Associated members ==
Kevin Kendrick, Jeff Nelson, Willie Morris, Anthony Lockett and Aaron Mills continue to tour with Cameo as well as other artists. Kevin Kendrick and Aaron Mills have both worked with Outkast, playing on their singles &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; (2000) and &quot;Prototype&quot; (2003), among other tracks. Ex-Cameo vocalist John Kellogg became an entertainment lawyer, representing such artists as the O&#x27;Jays, Gerald Levert and LSG. He also pursued a career in music industry higher education, becoming Assistant Chair of the Music Business/Management department at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Gregory B. Johnson has released two CDs on his own label, Allspice Record Co.—in 2007 &quot;A New Hip&quot;, which is a smooth Jazz CD, and in 2012 &quot;Funk Funk (Just for a Little Time)&quot;, an urban funk CD.

==Style==
Cameo began as a horn-oriented funk band in the 1970s, influenced by Parliament-Funkadelic. By the 1980s, Cameo expanded their sound with influences from pop, hip hop, rock and reggae, and placed more emphasis on keyboards and drum machines.

<doc id="973104" wikidata="Q8077356" url="?curid=973104" title="Æthelbert of York">
<text>Æthelbert (died 8 November 780) was an eighth-century scholar, teacher, and Archbishop of York. Related to his predecessor at York, he became a monk at an early age and was in charge of the cathedral&#x27;s library and school before becoming archbishop. He taught a number of missionaries and scholars, including Alcuin, at the school. While archbishop, Æthelbert sent missionaries to the Continent. Æthelbert retired before his death, and during his retirement consecrated another church in York.

==Early life==

Æthelbert was the teacher and intimate friend of Alcuin, whose poem on the saints and prelates of the Church of York, &quot;Versus de Patribus Regibus et de Sanctis et Pontificibus Ecclesiæ Eboracensis&quot;, is the principal source of information concerning Æthelbert&#x27;s life. He was a kinsman of his predecessor Ecgbert, who was brother to Eadberht, King of Northumbria. Æthelbert&#x27;s family placed him in a monastery as a young child, where he was a pupil in the school founded at York by Ecgbert. Ecgbert ordained Æthelbert as a priest put him in charge of the school.

Æthelbert was instrumental in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books to be found in Europe outside of Rome. Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon. Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we know that he visited Rome among other places. Alcuin&#x27;s poem &quot;Versus&quot; lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the &quot;trivium&quot; as well as the &quot;quadrivium&quot;, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.

==Archbishop==

In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, the feast day of his predecessor Wilfrid. This may have been deliberate and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid&#x27;s ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin&#x27;s description of Æthelbert&#x27;s time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops to use as a role model. Alcuin praised Æthelbert and his predecessor Ecgbert for adorning various churches of York and for giving splendid ornaments to York Minster.

Æthelbert also commissioned Eanbald and Alcuin the job of overseeing the construction of a new church in York, the basilica of &quot;Alma Sophia&quot;, the Church of Holy Wisdom. It was possibly modelled on the Frankish royal chapel of Aachen, or the rotunda of San Vitale in Ravenna. According to Alcuin, &quot;Alma Sophia&quot; was lofty, supported by many columns and arches, with inlaid ceilings and glazed windows. The core church was surrounded by chapels and galleries, and it boasted thirty altars. &quot;Alma Sophia&quot; was never mentioned again in written records, and no remains have ever been found. Academic debate is split on whether it was next door to the pre-Norman Conquest cathedral, or whether it was elsewhere in the city, perhaps across the river Ouse: possible sites include Bishopshill, or Holy Trinity, Micklegate.

Æthelbert sent out missionaries to the pagans of Northern Europe, among them Alubert and Liudger, who went to northern Germany. Liudger had earlier been a pupil at the school in York, and went on to become the first Bishop of Munster. Æthelbert was the recipient of letters from one of the missionaries – Lull, the Archbishop of Mainz, assuming that Lull&#x27;s correspondent &quot;Coena&quot;, who is an archbishop and who was being asked for the works of Bede, is actually Æthelbert, as most historians seem convinced of. Books were sent to the missionaries from the York library.

In 774, Æthelbert called a council which deposed Alhred the King of Northumbria and sent the ex-king north into exile with the Picts. The cause of the deposition may have been related to missionary work. The historian D. P. Kirby feels that Æthelbert was not a supporter of Alhred prior to his deposition. Alhred was replaced with Æthelred, who was replaced in 778 by Ælfwald, the son of Oswulf. Kirby sees Æthelbert&#x27;s withdrawal of support as instrumental in the deposition of Æthelred, noting that Ælfwald was closely related to Æthelbert, unlike both Alhred and Æthelred. Kirby also notes that medieval chroniclers noted that Æthelbert is said to have not &quot;spared evil kings&quot;.

==Retirement and death==

Æthelbert retired some time before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this occurred is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, but it could be 777 too. Eanbald&#x27;s position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. He lived long enough to consecrate the new church of &quot;Alma Sophia&quot;, ten days before his death on 8 November.

<text>Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils is a wuxia novel by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). It was first serialised concurrently from 3 September 1963 to 27 May 1966 in the newspapers &quot;Ming Pao&quot; in Hong Kong and &quot;Nanyang Siang Pau&quot; in Singapore. It has been adapted into films and television series in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China numerous times since the 1970s. Set in 11th-century China, the plot is made up of separate yet intertwining storylines revolving around three protagonists – Qiao Feng, Duan Yu and Xuzhu – and other characters from various empires (Song, Liao, Dali, Western Xia and Tibet) and martial arts sects. The novel examines the cause and effect that form and break the inherent bonds underlying each major character&#x27;s struggles on five uniquely corresponding levels: self, family, society, ethnic group, and country (dominion).

The novel&#x27;s Chinese title is a reference to the eight races of demi-gods and semi-devils described in Buddhist cosmology as the major characters are based on the eight races. In Buddhism, these demi-gods and semi-devils are markedly different from the human race but are still bound to Saṃsāra by their own desires. Jin Yong originally modelled each major character after one of the races but, as he continued writing, the complexity of the story made it impossible for such a simplistic mapping. The novel&#x27;s title has been a challenge for translators for years before it was decided to be &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot;. An alternative English title is &quot;Eight Books of the Heavenly Dragon&quot;.

==Plot==
The plot is made up of separate yet intertwining storylines revolving around three protagonists – Qiao Feng, Duan Yu and Xuzhu – who become sworn brothers in chapter 41. The complex narrative switches from the initial perspective of Duan Yu to those of the other protagonists and back.

===Duan Yu&#x27;s story===
Duan Yu is a young and naïve prince of the Dali Kingdom. His reverence for Buddhist teachings and disdain for bloodshed prompt him to defy his family&#x27;s tradition of practising martial arts. When his father, Duan Zhengchun, tries to force him to learn martial arts, he runs away from home. Ironically, for the sake of survival, he ends up mastering three powerful skills and becomes a formidable martial artist. In addition, he acquires immunity to poison after accidentally consuming the Zhuha, a venomous toad.

During his adventures, he encounters five young maidens – Zhong Ling, Mu Wanqing, Wang Yuyan, Azhu and Azi – and becomes romantically involved with the first three. However, at different points in the novel, he is led to believe that they are all his half-sisters due to Duan Zhengchun&#x27;s secret affairs with other women in the past. Of these maidens, he is extremely obsessed with Wang Yuyan, who resembles a statue of a fairy-like lady he chanced upon before. He relentlessly tries to win her heart but she does not reciprocate because she has a crush on her cousin, Murong Fu.

Towards the end of the novel, Duan Yu finds out that he is actually not Duan Zhengchun&#x27;s biological son, hence he can marry all the three maidens. In the original ending, his love life ends on a happy note when Wang Yuyan finally realises that he truly loves her and decides to marry him. However, after the book was published, many readers disliked this ending as it relegated Mu Wanqing to a minor role in the story. In the latest revision of the novel, Duan Yu and Wang Yuyan&#x27;s romance is marred by a series of incidents which eventually cause them to be separated and Duan Yu ends up with Mu Wanqing and Zhong Ling.

===Qiao Feng&#x27;s story===
Qiao Feng is the charismatic chief of the Beggars&#x27; Sect who possesses strong leadership qualities and exceptional prowess in martial arts. He falls from grace after he is revealed to be a Khitan, and after he is wrongly accused of murdering his adoptive parents and some fellow martial artists. He becomes an outcast of the &quot;wulin&quot; (martial artists&#x27; community) of the Han Chinese-dominated Song Empire, which is at war with the Khitan-led Liao Empire. Qiao Feng&#x27;s relations with the Han Chinese martial artists worsen due to the Song–Liao conflict, and also because he is now seen as a murderer and a threat to the &quot;wulin&quot;. He is forced to sever ties with them and engage them in a one-against-several battle, during which he single-handedly kills many opponents, including some of his old friends and acquaintances.

Qiao Feng leaves to verify the claims that he is a Khitan and investigate the murders. He is accompanied by Azhu, who loves him and stands by him when the &quot;wulin&quot; turns against him. After a long journey in disguise, he concludes that he is indeed a Khitan and changes his name to Xiao Feng to reflect his ancestry. In tracking down a mysterious &quot;Leading Big Brother&quot;, whom he believes is responsible for the murders and his parents&#x27; deaths, he mistakenly thinks that Duan Zhengchun is the &quot;Leading Big Brother&quot;, and challenges him to a one-to-one fight. However, the event turns into a tragedy when Azhu finds out she is Duan Zhengchun&#x27;s daughter and she disguises herself as her father and allows Xiao Feng to kill her. It is too late when Xiao Feng realises his mistake. Before dying, Azhu tells Xiao Feng that Duan Zhengchun is actually her father, and she hopes that her sacrifice will satisfy his thirst for vengeance.

Feeling regret and sorrow, Xiao Feng leaves Song territory with Azi, Azhu&#x27;s younger sister, whom he has promised to take care of. Azi has a crush on him but he does not reciprocate her feelings as he loved only her sister. They wander far into northeast China and settle down among the Jurchen tribes. By chance, Xiao Feng encounters the Liao emperor, Yelü Hongji, becomes sworn brothers with him, and helps him suppress a rebellion by a Liao prince. In return, Xiao Feng receives the prince&#x27;s title and estate. Xiao Feng returns to the Song Empire later to find Azi and attend a &quot;wulin&quot; gathering at Shaolin Monastery, where he combines forces with Duan Yu and Xuzhu to overcome their foes. At Shaolin, the truths behind all the murders are revealed and the guilty parties receive their just deserts; Xiao Feng also successfully proves his innocence and makes peace with the &quot;wulin&quot;.

Towards the end of the novel, Yelü Hongji plans to invade the Song Empire and wants Xiao Feng to support him, but the latter refuses and attempts to dissuade him to prevent bloodshed. The Liao emperor imprisons Xiao Feng and leads his army to attack Song. In the meantime, Azi escapes from Liao and seeks help from Duan Yu, Xuzhu and their allies. Impressed by Xiao Feng&#x27;s righteousness, they manage to rally martial artists from throughout the &quot;wulin&quot; to join them in rescuing Xiao Feng. Even though the mission is successful, they are ultimately outnumbered and trapped by Liao forces at Yanmen Pass. Xiao Feng takes Yelü Hongji hostage and forces him to promise that there will be no war between Song and Liao for as long as he lives. He then commits suicide while Azi follows suit.

===Xuzhu&#x27;s story===
Xuzhu is a monk from the Shaolin Sect who is described to have a kind-hearted and submissive personality. He strongly believes in following the Buddhist code of conduct and refuses to break it even when he faces life-threatening situations. He follows his elders to a meeting, which marks the start of his adventures. By coincidence and sheer luck, he breaks a weiqi formation and inherits the powers and position of Wuyazi, the leader of the Carefree Sect. Later, he encounters Tianshan Tonglao, learns martial arts from her, and eventually succeeds her as the ruler of Lingjiu Palace, which commands allegiance from a loose assembly of martial artists.

Feeling overwhelmed by the sudden influx of responsibilities and a major leap in martial prowess, Xuzhu desires to detach himself from these duties and return to his former monastic life. However, he is unable to wrench himself free from the various tribulations and dangers that lie ahead. He is no longer regarded as a Shaolin monk and has no choice but to accept his fate. He also has a pitiful parentage: he is actually the illegitimate son of Xuanci, the abbot of Shaolin, and Ye Erniang, one of the &quot;Four Evils&quot;. His reunion with his parents is fated to be the first and also the last. Later, by chance again, he becomes the prince consort of Western Xia due to his previous affair with Princess Yinchuan, to whom he is deeply in love. Avoid repeating his father&#x27;s mistakes, Xuzhu forsakes his monastic life to be with the princess and happily married.

<text>Ivar Eugen Ballangrud (né &quot;Eriksen&quot;, 7 March 1904 – 1 June 1969) was a Norwegian speed skater, a four-time Olympic champion in speed skating. As the only triple gold medalist at the 1936 Winter Olympics, Ballangrud was the most successful athlete there.

==Biography==
Ivar Ballangrud was one of the most successful speed skaters in the world for a period of 15 years, from 1924 to 1939. Coming from the small place Lunner on Hadeland, he was a member of the famous &quot;Hadeland Trio&quot;, consisting of himself, Michael Staksrud and Hans Engnestangen. He represented the club Trondhjems Skøiteklub.

Ballangrud was four times World Allround Champion, four times European Allround Champion, five times Norwegian Allround Champion, and four times Olympic Champion. He won three Olympic titles at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen: 500 m (quite surprisingly), 5000 m, and 10,000 m. On the 1500 m during those Winter Olympics, he won silver – his teammate Charles Mathiesen being the only one to keep him from winning gold in all four speed skating events. Ballangrud had won his first Olympic gold 8 years earlier on the 5000 m at the 1928 Winter Olympics. In addition, he won a bronze medal (1500 m) in 1928 and a silver medal (10,000 m) at the 1932 Winter Olympics. He would have been the favourite for winning more Olympic gold in 1932 if the races had been held in the normal European way, not the American &quot;pack-style&quot; way where all competitors are on the ice at the same time.

He made his international debut as a 19-year-old rising star in 1924, although it was too late to compete in the Winter Olympics that year. However, he was paired with Julius Skutnabb – who had just become the Olympic 10,000 m Champion – in his first World Championships in Helsinki in 1924, and beat the champion on his homeground. In 1930, he dethroned Oscar Mathisen from the top of the Adelskalender and he would remain the number one on the Adelskalender for seven years.

In addition to his five official world records, Ballangrud skated 16:46.4 in a 10,000 m &quot;pack-style&quot; test race before the Olympic Games in 1932. This time was 31 seconds below the then-current world record and it would stand unbeaten as the fastest 10,000 m time for twenty years, until Hjalmar Andersen set his famous world record of 16:32.6.

In December 1932 it was announced that he became professional.

Ballangrud was born as Ivar Eriksen. His mother changed his last name when she remarried following her husband&#x27;s death. In retirement Ballangrud worked at his sporting good store in Drammen, and later in Trondheim. A statue in his honor was raised in his native Jevnaker.

Over the course of his career, Ballangrud skated five world records:

===Personal records===
To put these personal records in perspective, the &quot;Notes&quot; column lists the official world records on the dates that Ballangrud skated his personal records.



Note that Ballangrud&#x27;s personal record on the 1500 m was not a world record because Hans Engnestangen skated 2:13.8 at the same tournament.

Ballangrud has an Adelskalender score of 188.806 points. He was number one on the Adelskalender for a total of 3,675 days, divided over two periods between 1930 and 1942.

<doc id="973115" wikidata="Q552058" url="?curid=973115" title="Enrique of Malacca">
<text>Enrique of Malacca (; ), was a Malay member of the Magellan expedition that completed the first circumnavigation of the world in 1519–1522. He was acquired as a slave by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1511 at the age of 14 years, probably in the early stages of the capture of Malacca. Magellan&#x27;s will calls him &quot;a native of Malacca&quot;, while Antonio Pigafetta states that he was a native of Sumatra.
Magellan took him to Europe, and in 1519 he was brought along on the famous circumnavigation expedition.
According to some historians, it is possible that he could be the first person to circumnavigate the globe and return to his starting point, however, there is no record or source that confirms it.

When Magellan appeared before the Spanish king, he spoke of Enrique as &quot;a slave that he had had in Malacca, because he was from those islands they called him Enrique de Malacca.&quot; Antonio Pigafetta, a participant who wrote the most comprehensive account of Magellan&#x27;s voyage, called him &quot;Henrique&quot; (which was Hispanicised as &quot;Enrique&quot; in official Spanish documents) and also referred to him as a slave.

==Magellan expedition==
Enrique accompanied Magellan back to Europe and onwards on Magellan&#x27;s search for a westward passage to the East Indies, and he served as an interpreter for the Spaniards. American historian Laurence Bergreen says that Enrique was believed to be native of the Spice Islands. Magellan produced letters from a Portuguese acquaintance, Francisco Serrão, who located the Spice Islands so far to the east of Spain, that they lay in the area granted to Spain, rather than Portugal. This gave Spain an opportunity to claim the Spice Islands.

Ginés de Mafra explicitly states in his first hand account that Enrique was taken on the expedition primarily because of his ability to speak the Malay language: &quot;He [Magellan] told his men that they were now in the land he had desired, and sent a man named Herédia, who was the ship&#x27;s clerk, ashore with a Native they had taken, so they said, because he was known to speak Malay, the language spoken in the Malay Archipelago.&quot; The island in the Philippines where Enrique spoke and was understood by the natives was Mazaua, which Mafra locates somewhere near Mindanao.

==After Magellan&#x27;s death==
Magellan had provided in his will that Enrique was to be freed upon his death. But after the battle, the remaining ships&#x27; masters refused this bequest.

The Genoese pilot of the Magellan expedition wrongly stated in his eye-witness account that the Spaniards had no interpreter when they returned to Cebu, because Enrique had died on Mactan along with Magellan during the Battle of Mactan in 1521. However, Enrique was very much alive on 1 May 1521, and attended a feast given by Rajah Humabon to the Spaniards. Antonio Pigafetta writes that the survivor João Serrão, who was pleading with the crew from the shore to save him from the Cebuano tribesmen, said that all those who went to the banquet were slain, except for Enrique. A discourse by Giovanni Battista Ramusio claims that Enrique warned the Chief of Subuth [sic] that the Spaniards were plotting to capture the king and that this led to the murder of Serrão and others at the banquet.

==Possibility of the first circumnavigation==
Enrique accompanied Magellan on all his voyages, including the voyage that circumnavigated the world between 1519 and 1521. On 1 May he left in Cebu, with the presumed intention to return to his home island, and there is nothing more said of Enrique in any document.

If he succeeded in returning to his home before July 1522, he would have been the first person to circumnavigate the world and return to his starting point. According to Maximilianus Transylvanus and Antonio Pigafetta documents, Elcano and his sailors were the first to circumnavigate the globe. Enrique is only documented to have traveled with Magellan from Malacca to Cebu in two segments—from Malacca to Portugal in 1511 and from Spain to Cebu in 1519–1521. The distance between Cebu and Malacca is 2500 km (approximately 20 degrees of longitude), which is left to complete the circumnavigation. It is not known if he ever had a chance to complete a circumnavigation, but it would have been possible: Cebu was part of the regional trade network that dealt in spices, gold, and slaves.
==Ethnicity and identity==
In his last will, Magellan describes Enrique as a mulatto and native of Malacca, which is part of modern Malaysia today. Alternately, Pigafetta described him as coming from Sumatra in modern-day Indonesia, located just across the Strait of Malacca. Either way, Enrique is generally accepted to have been an ethnic Malay. However, it has been asserted by Filipino historian Carlos Quirino that Enrique was himself a Visayan Filipino, a Cebuano or native of Cebu in the Philippines, on the assumption that Enrique must have conversed with the Cebuanos in their Cebuano language instead of the Malay language as attested by primary sources (the Malay language was the lingua franca of the region).

==In popular culture==

=== Fictional works ===
In Malaysia, a character known as Panglima Awang, a name given by a historical novel author, Harun Aminurrashid in his same novel titled which was written in 1957 and first published in 1958 by &quot;Pustaka Melayu&quot; (under brand: &quot;Buku Punggok&quot;) is based on Enrique. According to the author, he gave Enrique the Malay name &quot;Awang&quot; to match his presumed ethnicity, while the title &quot;Panglima&quot; () refers to Enrique&#x27;s wisdom, strength and activeness.

In Indonesia, a book title &quot;&quot; (The first circumnavigator was an Indonesian: Enrique of Moluccas), written by Helmy Yahya and Reinhard Tawas, edited by Imam Hidayah has released in 2014. Moreover, Yahya continued to write the novel about Enrique Maluku with the title of &quot;Clavis Mundi&quot; in 2022, together with his colleagues (Utama Prastha and Donna Widjajanto, as well as research by Reinhard Tawas).

In 2021, the historical novel &quot;Enrique the Black&quot; by Singapore author Danny Jalil was published by Penguin Random House SEA. The book depicts a fictionalized account of Enrique as a Malay teenager who was taken by Ferdinand Magellan and forced into slavery, later playing a pivotal role as an interpreter on the journey to the Moluccas Spice Islands, where the inhabitants speak the Malay language.

<doc id="973118" wikidata="Q7174971" url="?curid=973118" title="Peter Jensen (bishop)">
<text>Peter Frederick Jensen (born 11 July 1943) is a retired Australian Anglican bishop, theologian and academic. From 1985 to 2001, he was principal of Moore Theological College. From 2001 to 2013, he was the Archbishop of Sydney and Metropolitan of the Province of New South Wales in the Anglican Church of Australia. He retired on his 70th birthday, 11 July 2013. In late 2007, Jensen was one of the founding members of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), which he served as General Secretary. He stepped down in early 2019 and was succeeded by Benjamin Kwashi, former archbishop of Jos in Nigeria.

==Early life and education==
Jensen was born in Sydney and educated at Bellevue Hill Public School and The Scots College. After completing his Leaving Certificate, Jensen studied law for two years and worked as an articled clerk before he moved into primary school teaching.

Jensen entered Moore Theological College in the late 1960s and won the Hey Sharp prize for coming first in the Licentiate of Theology, the standard course of study at that time. He also has a Master of Arts degree from Sydney University, a Bachelor of Divinity degree from the University of London and a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree from the University of Oxford. His 1976 master&#x27;s dissertation was entitled &quot;Calvinism and the Persecution of the Witches in England (1563–1604)&quot; and his 1979 doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;The Life of Faith in the Teaching of Elizabethan Protestantism&quot;.

==Ordained ministry==
Jensen was ordained in the Anglican Church of Australia as a deacon in 1969 and as a priest in 1970. He was a curate at St. Barnabas, Broadway, between 1969 and 1976. From 1976 to 1979, while studying for his doctorate at the University of Oxford, he was granted permission to officiate in the Diocese of Oxford, England.

From 1973 to 1976 and 1980 to 1984, he lectured in systematic and biblical theology at Moore Theological College. He was appointed Principal in 1985 and held the post until becoming a bishop in 2001. He gained a reputation as a gifted preacher and was often seen at the annual Katoomba Christian Conventions.

On 5 June 2001, Jensen became the 11th Archbishop of Sydney. He was consecrated on St Peter&#x27;s Day, 29 June 2001. He called upon all churches in the Sydney diocese to aim to reach 10% of their communities by 2012. He also encouraged an unprecedented increase in church planting. Over the course of 2002–2008, 136 new congregations were started within the diocese, particularly within the Northern, Western and Wollongong regions. The number of candidates for ordination within the diocese increased from 20 to 30 per year to 40-50 by 2008.

Shortly after his appointment as Archbishop of Sydney, Jensen was accused of nepotism after nominating his brother, Phillip Jensen, as Dean of Sydney and appointing his own wife, Christine Jensen, to a lay position in a new women&#x27;s ministry team. However, according to a spokesperson for Jensen, his wife was the only unpaid member of this team, and the new role was &quot;just an extension of what she&#x27;s been doing for many years, as the wife of the Moore College principal and now as the wife of the archbishop&quot;.

==Views==
Jensen has a reputation with the Australian media for being an outspoken advocate for evangelical Christianity. He has spoken out on issues as diverse as abortion, euthanasia and embryonic stem cell research as well as on industrial relations. He has expressed his opposition to the ordination of women as priests, saying &quot;the church is more like a family and, within the family, men are the spiritual guides&quot;, but believes women can be appointed to the diaconate, and has ordained women as such within the Sydney diocese. He is opposed to the ordination of women as bishops. In 2012 he declined to participate in the consecration of a woman bishop, Genieve Blackwell, within the Canberra-Goulburn diocese of the province of New South Wales &quot;for reasons of conscience&quot; and deputised the Bishop of Newcastle to do so. He has also opposed the ordination of non-celibate gay people as clergy.

In late 2007, Jensen was one of the founding members of the Global Anglican Future Conference which was held in June 2008, one month prior to the Lambeth Conference.

In a June 2012 opinion piece, Jensen argued that the acceptance of same-sex marriage is not &quot;for the moral good&quot;. He also criticised the notion of &quot;marriage equality&quot;, noting that society does not allow marriage between siblings or between adults and children. He also wrote a letter to parishioners of Sydney&#x27;s Anglican churches in which he quoted Bible extracts from Genesis on the nature of marriage and said that &quot;The education of children must not be distorted by the state-imposed idea that a family can be founded on the sexual union of two men or two women as a valid alternative to that of a man and a woman.&quot;

In September 2012, Jensen was a panellist on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; program and was questioned about his views on several key issues involving the church and society. On the question of whether women should be submissive to their husbands, Jensen focused on the vows made by the husband at the time of marriage to act towards his wife in a Christ-like manner.

On the &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; program, when questioned as to whether he supported the attitudes of the Australian Christian Lobby towards homosexuality, including a statement that it was &quot;like smoking&quot;, Jensen said, &quot;As far as I can see by trying to get to the facts, the lifespan of practising gays is significantly shorter than the ordinary, so-called, heterosexual man. I think that seems to be the case. Now what we need to do is to look at why this may be the case and we need to do it in a compassionate and objective way.&quot; Jensen was questioned by a young homosexual Christian man who had contemplated suicide about what he would say to young people in that position. It was stated by a panel member, journalist Anna Crean, that Jensen&#x27;s position was one of influence and that people, by the process of being made to feel ostracised, were subject to &quot;self-destruction&quot;. Jensen was then offered by a youth worker in the audience the opportunity to discuss the suffering of young homosexual people resulting from comments made by Jensen and the ACL. Jensen responded that the matter was complex and that he would like to hear the facts. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s all very well to say that what I say causes this. That to my mind is ...already facile.&quot; When questioned as to whether God might be responsible for a &quot;gay gene&quot;, Jensen responded that God created and loves all people. He stated that same-sex attraction was not the important issue and that what he was talking about was the acting out of same-sex attraction. Jensen was asked whether he thought that his attitudes towards gay marriage and the submission of women were contributing factors in the rise of atheism. He responded that he did not believe that there had been a rise in atheism. He concluded by saying that God had revealed himself through Jesus and that through him, all people have equality.

Jensen has advocated &quot;lay administration&quot; in which lay people could be licensed to preside at Holy Communion services. This reflects his view that the ministry of word and sacrament belong together and, as lay people have long been permitted to preach in the Sydney diocese, it is thought they ought to be permitted to lead communion services.

==Publications==
Jensen has written a number of books on Christian doctrine, including &quot;At the Heart of the Universe&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Revelation of God&quot; (2002). In November and December 2005 he also delivered the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Boyer Lectures on the topic &quot;The Future of Jesus&quot;. These lectures have subsequently been published as a book.

Jensen, as of 2014, is a co-editor of the &quot;Reformed Theological Review&quot;. He also authored the Lenten study &quot;Power and Promise&quot; released by Anglican Press Australia in late 2014.

<doc id="973136" wikidata="Q1247572" url="?curid=973136" title="Touch of Grey">
<text>&quot;Touch of Grey&quot; is a 1987 single by the Grateful Dead, and is from the album &quot;In the Dark&quot;. The song is known for its refrain &quot;I will get by / I will survive.&quot; It combines dark lyrics in the verses with upbeat pop instrumentation. A simple pronoun change in the final chorus (“We will get by / We will survive”) transformed the song into an anthem, especially for the band&#x27;s most ardent followers. 

The music was composed by Jerry Garcia, and the lyrics were written by Robert Hunter. It was also released as a music video, the first one by the Grateful Dead.

The song was first performed as an encore on September 15, 1982, at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, and was finally released on &quot;In the Dark&quot; in 1987. The song reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 9, and reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, the only song by the band ever to do so on both charts. It was released as a single with &quot;My Brother Esau&quot; and later &quot;Throwing Stones&quot;, and has appeared on a number of albums and collections.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; gained major airplay on MTV and featured a live performance of the band, first shown to be life-size skeleton marionettes dressed as the band, then as themselves. The skeleton of bassist Phil Lesh catches a rose in its teeth, thrown by a female attendee; later, a dog steals the lower leg of percussionist Mickey Hart, and a stagehand hurries to retrieve and reattach it. Near the end of the video, the camera tilts up into the rafters to reveal that the living band members are themselves marionettes being operated by a pair of skeletal hands.

The video was directed by Gary Gutierrez, who had previously created the animation sequences for &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;. It was filmed at Laguna Seca Raceway after one of the band&#x27;s concerts in May 1987.

The popularity of the single and its video helped introduce the Grateful Dead to a new group of fans, resulting in the band gaining additional mainstream attention.

==Video documentary==
The Grateful Dead also released a 30-minute documentary called &quot;Dead Ringers: The Making of Touch of Grey&quot;, about the production of the music video. The documentary was directed by Justin Kreutzmann, the son of drummer Bill Kreutzmann.

==Personnel==
* Jerry Garcia – lead vocals, lead guitar
* Bob Weir – rhythm guitar, backing vocals
* Phil Lesh – bass guitar
* Brent Mydland – organ, synthesizer, backing vocals
* Bill Kreutzmann – drums and percussion
* Mickey Hart – drums and percussion

==Legacy==
The song &quot;Harmony Hall&quot; by Vampire Weekend has been compared to &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;.

==Chart performance==

&quot;Touch of Grey&quot; reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and peaked at number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; is the band&#x27;s only recording ever to reach the Top 40 on the Hot 100.

<text>Batbayan ruled the Khazarian Bulgars from 667 to 690 CE. Theophanes and Nicephorus record his rule after the Khazars defeated the Bulgars and Old Great Bulgaria disintegrated in 668 CE.

There is a scholarly theory that he may have been the same person as Bezmer of the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans who may have been also the first son of Kubrat. He was a member of the Dulo clan, who after Kubrat&#x27;s death in the mid-7th century ruled Old Great Bulgaria, but his rule lasted only three years. Kevin Alan Brook calls him Bayan. Batbayan would subsequently have ruled the Bulgars as a subject of the Khazar Khagan.

<doc id="973147" wikidata="Q4573221" url="?curid=973147" title="1968 Special Olympics World Summer Games">
<text>The 1968 Special Olympics World Summer Games were held in Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois, United States, on July 20, 1968. Some of the smaller indoor events were held in the Conrad Hilton Hotel on Michigan Avenue. The event was co-sponsored by the Chicago Park District and the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation.

1,000 athletes from 26 U.S. states, Canada, and France competed in track and swimming.

The athlete&#x27;s oath was introduced at these games by founder Eunice Shriver at the opening ceremony. The oath is, &quot;Let me win. But if I can not win, let me be brave in the attempt.&quot;

==Planning and logistics==
The inception of the concept for the Special Olympics came from Anne McGlone (now Anne Burke), at the time a physical education teacher working for the Chicago Park District. In 1967, while teaching special needs children, she had the idea to host a citywide track meet for such children. She asked Park District Superintendent Erwin &quot;Red&quot; Weiner and Park District Board President William McFetridge for permission to organize it. The Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation had provided earlier funding to special needs programs in the Park District, thus McFetridge believed that Eunice Kennedy Shriver might be willing to provide funding for such an event. In early 1968, McGlone wrote to Shriver proposing the event, and within days received an enthusiastic response from Shriver. The event evolved from a track meet into an Olympics-style event for special needs children.

To assist in organizing the event, they received help from Dr. William H. Freeberg of Southern Illinois University, who was an expert in recreation for children with disabilities. They also received the assistance of Parks Board vice president Dan Shannon and McFetridge&#x27;s assistant Ed Kelly. The event began to take a national, then later even an international, scale as planning advanced. The games were held on a budget of roughly $50,000.

Notable athletes volunteered at the games, including Jesse Owens, Rafer Johnson, George Armstrong, and Stan Mikita.

== Sports ==
* Track and field
** 50-yard dash
** 300-yard run
** Long jump
** High jump
** Softball throw
* Swimming
** 25-yard swim
** 100-yard swim
** Water polo
* Floor hockey

1,000 athletes from 26 U.S. states, Canada, and France competed in track and swimming. Swimming had two events including 25 meter races, and track and field had four events including 50 yard dash, 300 yard run, and standing long jump. There was also a softball throwing event. 

==Aftermath==
The inaugural event was very modest in comparison to later editions. Only several hundred spectators attended, with most being relatives of competitors. However, there event was nevertheless a successful proof of concept for the Special Olympics movement. In December, the charitable nonprofit &quot;Special Olympics, Inc.&quot; was established. The Special Olympics continue to be held, and have significantly expanded in scope.

<doc id="973152" wikidata="Q2822962" url="?curid=973152" title="Aces High (video game)">
<text>Aces High (formerly known as &quot;Aces High II&quot;) is a combat flight simulation and massively multiplayer online game for Microsoft Windows. It was created by HiTech Creations and originally released on May 8, 2000; the game is subscriber based. It features aircraft from both the World War II and World War I eras, as well as smaller numbers of ground vehicles and ships. In 2016, HiTech Creations re-released the game with improved graphics and sounds.

While the main focus of &quot;Aces High&quot; is on World War II aerial combat, there is also a smaller selection of ground vehicles, ships, and World War I aircraft. There are over 100 aircraft, vehicles, and boats individually modeled in the game.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Aces High&quot; is an open-ended combat flight simulator, where players can fly online or offline, and engage other players in air, land, or sea-based combat. Strategy is similar to capture the flag; there are three countries at war and the object is to win the war by capturing a percentage of the other two countries fields while retaining a percentage of your own fields. Capturing and defending fields takes cooperation of players of each side. Player built maps are rotated at the end of each war, reset, and started over. War lasts anywhere from hours to days depending on the arena and populations present.

=== World War II ===

The main (and original) focus of &quot;Aces High&quot; is World War II aerial combat. This takes place in several online arenas, the focuses of which include &#x27;early&#x27;, &#x27;middle&#x27;, and &#x27;late&#x27; war aircraft. In addition to this, the World War II arenas also contain ground and naval combat, both of which operate alongside the air war. Although the selection of ground vehicles was a little lacking, it was later improved with the addition of the M4A3 and the M4A3(76) (a version armed with a 76mm high velocity gun as opposed to a 75mm low velocity gun, which would give better anti-tank capabilities at the cost of less powerful high-explosive shells).

=== World War I ===
HiTech Creations added aircraft from World War I in 2010, containing four aircraft: the Fokker Dr.I, Sopwith Camel, Bristol F.2B, and Fokker D.VII.

The World War 1 arena is set up as a dogfighting arena with 3 countries set up and bases in close proximity.

=== Scenarios ===
Scenarios are special large-scale battles in &quot;Aces High&quot; that run a 2-3 times per year. Usually, they are based on actual World War II battles, such as the Battle of Britain. Sometimes they are based on hypothetical battles that might have been. A scenario typically involves about 150 people divided into two sides, each with a dedicated command staff. Each side has particular aircraft, mission objectives, squadron assignments, bases, and resources. A scenario typically runs over the course of a month, with one battle per week, each battle lasting 3–4 hours.

Jackson in the title role with Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Dan Hedaya, Busta Rhymes, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. It is a sequel to the 1971 &quot;Shaft&quot; film, in which Jackson plays the nephew (retconned as his son in the 2019 film) of John Shaft. The film opened at the number-one position at the box office when it debuted June 16, 2000. It received mixed to positive reviews on Metacritic, with the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes praising Jackson&#x27;s charisma.

==Plot==
In 1998, called in to investigate the grievous assault of Trey Howard outside a restaurant, NYPD Detective John Shaft arrests Walter Wade Jr., the son of a wealthy real estate tycoon, after noticing blood on him. Wade claims self-defense. Shaft notices an injured waitress, Diane Palmieri, eyeing Wade, and unsuccessfully tries to coax a statement from her.

Trey&#x27;s friend tells Shaft that when she and Trey entered the restaurant, Wade racially harassed him. Trey humiliated Wade back and left the restaurant, pursued by Wade. Shaft looks for Diane but she has left. Trey goes into a seizure and dies; when Wade mocks Trey, Shaft punches Wade in the nose, and does it again after being threatened with reassignment to another precinct. At the trial, the judge grants Wade bail of $200k. He later calls Shaft to thank him for breaking his nose, and says he has fled to Switzerland.

Two years later, Wade returns to the U.S., and Shaft greets and arrests him, with the help of cab driver Rassan posing as Wade’s limo driver. Shaft&#x27;s friends throw him a celebratory party where the elder &quot;Uncle&quot; John Shaft appears, the same character from the 1971 movie, and warns him that Wade&#x27;s wealth raises his chances of acquittal. While Wade is temporarily detained at police headquarters, Dominican drug lord Peoples Hernandez, whom Shaft previously arrested, befriends him. At the hearing, the judge has Wade surrender his passport and sets bail at $1 million. Shaft resigns from the police force, vowing to bring Wade to justice on his own terms.

Shaft searches for Diane with the help of friend and former colleague Detective Carmen Vasquez, but only locates her mother, Ann. Meanwhile, Wade offers his deceased mother&#x27;s jewelry to hire Peoples to go after her. Peoples wants Wade to join him in his drug business, but agrees to the job provided that Wade sells the jewelry. Peoples hires Shaft&#x27;s former colleague officers Jack Roselli and Jimmy Groves to tail Shaft; the pair reveal a snitch among Peoples&#x27; gang who had told Shaft what was happening. Disguised, Shaft and his former partner, Detective Luger, mug Wade of the money he gathered from selling the jewelry. He then plants the money on Roselli and Groves, and makes Peoples think they are double-crossing him. However, after getting word from People&#x27;s younger brother that Shaft has left the scene, they follow him.

Having traced a phone call, Shaft eventually locates Diane, but Peoples&#x27; gang attacks them. In the shootout, Shaft kills Peoples&#x27; younger brother. Diane&#x27;s brothers Mikey and Frankie arrive to retrieve her, but Mikey is stabbed by Peoples. Shaft, Diane, Rasaan, and Frankie regroup at Rasaan&#x27;s apartment, but are secretly followed by Roselli and Groves. Diane tells Shaft her eyewitness account of Wade murdering Trey. Wade threatened her to keep silent, and she was forced to accept a payoff provided that she disappear. Meanwhile, Peoples angrily attacks Wade over his brother&#x27;s death.

Roselli and Groves stake out Rassan&#x27;s apartment but when Carmen arrives and starts asking questions, they shoot her in the chest. Peoples&#x27; gang attack, with Shaft shooting back at them to defend the group while Diane and the others flee. Roselli and Groves catch Shaft, who commands Carmen, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, to shoot them, which she does. Peoples and his gang pursue and end up crashing Rassan&#x27;s car. When Peoples holds Diane hostage, Shaft persuades him to fight without weapons, but after a momentary faceoff, they draw backup handguns, with Shaft killing Peoples first.

Shaft assures Trey&#x27;s mother Carla about the new trial conditions, however, when Wade arrives, she shoots him several times and is subsequently arrested for avenging her son. Back at the police station, Shaft reiterates to Carmen his preference to be a private detective. The two are then visited by John&#x27;s uncle who stops by to visit. A woman then comes through asking them for help filing assault charges against her abusive boyfriend. Initially hesitant, Shaft agrees to help her his way. Shaft and his uncle go to confront the boyfriend, along with Rassan, whom Shaft presents with a new car.

==Production==
Singleton was a fan of the original film, which he said had wide appeal beyond its stereotype as a blaxploitation film, and he had sought to remake the film since he was young. &quot;Shaft&quot; started at MGM, but the studio did not like Singleton&#x27;s vision: Don Cheadle as the son of the original Shaft. After crime films by Quentin Tarantino became popular in the 1990s, producer Scott Rudin took an interest in &quot;Shaft&quot; and suggested taking it to Paramount Pictures. Paramount picked up the project in 1997 after paying back MGM&#x27;s development costs. Singleton said MGM balked at a $25 million film that they viewed as targeted to black audiences. Singleton and Shane Salerno wrote the original screenplay. Rudin vetoed the idea of a father-son team-up and brought in Richard Price to do rewrites, as he considered the original script to be too risque.

Rudin insisted on hiring a big name actor as the lead. Will Smith and Wesley Snipes were considered for the role of John Shaft. Snipes, responding to rumors that he was passed over, said he turned down the role because of the script, which he felt did not respect black culture or the original film. John Leguizamo was initially cast for the role of Peoples Hernandez. When Leguizamo left the production, Wright was cast. Singleton considered Lauryn Hill for the role of Carmen Vasquez. Jackson was unsure of accepting the role because he did not think of Shaft as being middle-aged, but he came to view his age as not an issue. With Jackson cast, the original Shaft was rewritten to be his uncle rather than his father to explain their smaller age gap.

Price&#x27;s rewrites, and Rudin&#x27;s insistence that they follow them, proved controversial with Singleton and Jackson. One point of contention was the lack of sex scenes, which had been a major element in the original film. Jackson attributed this change to political correctness. Another point was Shaft&#x27;s involvement with the police. Price fleshed out Shaft&#x27;s career with the police. Jackson praised Price&#x27;s ability to write police procedurals but did not like how long it took for Shaft to become a private eye. Rudin thought it more believable for Shaft to be protected by his badge, but Jackson demanded that Shaft quit the police force earlier; Jackson prevailed, and the scenes were rewritten. Singleton was careful from early on to ensure the character was hip. He felt Price&#x27;s rewrites got Shaft&#x27;s attitude wrong and inserted the wrong kind of pop cultural references. Jackson refused to say some of the lines, believing them to be racially insensitive or untrue to the character, drawing Rudin&#x27;s ire. When Singleton and Jackson criticized Price&#x27;s action sequences, Rudin asked them to compromise by shooting twice: once according to Price&#x27;s script and another as they wished, but Jackson was unwilling to risk having his objections overruled during editing.

Salerno described the post-production as &quot;brutal&quot; but said it came together despite the opposing views of the film. Roundtree&#x27;s and Bale&#x27;s scenes were reduced in editing. Rudin said Paramount forced them to reduce Roundtree&#x27;s screen time, whereas one of Bale&#x27;s fight scenes was deleted to give more time to Wright.

==Release==

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 115 reviews and an average rating of 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With a charismatic lead, this new &quot;Shaft&quot; knows how to push the right buttons.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50/100 based on 33 reviews, which the site rates as &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
The film opened at the box office at #1 with $21.7 million. By the end of its run, &quot;Shaft&quot; had grossed $70.3 million in the domestic box office and $107.2 million worldwide, against a $46 million budget.

===Merchandise===
In 2000, McFarlane Toys released a Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) action figure as part of their Movie Maniacs series three toy line. Accessories included are a handgun, sunglasses and a replica of the film&#x27;s poster with a skulls and bones base.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on June 6, 2000 by LaFace Records. It peaked at #22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Sequel==

Despite having an identical title, the 2019 film acts as a second remake-sequel to both this 2000 film and the originals starring Richard Roundtree. The 2019 release stars Jessie Usher as J.J. Shaft, an FBI agent and the son of Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s character. Both Jackson and Roundtree reprise their roles, but the film retroactively reveals that Roundtree&#x27;s character is actually the biological father of Jackson&#x27;s John Shaft, mentioning that Shaft Sr. spent years pretending to be his uncle. Unlike the 2000 film and the 1970s trilogy, the 2019 installment received mixed-to-negative reviews and failed at the box office.
