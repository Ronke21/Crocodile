<text>Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham (22 November 1564 – 24 January 1618 (Old Style)/3 February 1618 (New Style), lord of the Manor of Cobham, Kent, was an English peer who was implicated in the Main Plot against the rule of James I of England.

== Life ==

The son of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, by second wife Frances, daughter of Sir John Newton, he was educated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1597 he succeeded his father as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports under Queen Elizabeth. Shortly after the accession of James I, he was implicated in the &quot;Treason of the Main&quot; in 1603. His brother George was executed, and Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London by James I, probably in an attempt to obtain the Cobham estates for the Duke of Lennox.

He was the second husband of Lady Frances Howard, daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and Katherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham.

He may have been the subject of a number of Elizabethan satires such as Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;Lenten Stuffe&quot;, Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in his Humour&quot;, and may have been the model of Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff, who was originally given the name &quot;Oldcastle&quot;. Sir John Oldcastle shared the same title, Lord Cobham, as Henry Brooke. 

Although Falstaff is more likely modelled on his father, William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (also descended from John Oldcastle), who was married to Frances Newton, whose family name was originally Caradock; referenced in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; when Falstaff sings &quot;The Boy and the Mantle&quot;, a ballad in which Sir Caradoc&#x27;s wife comes away with her fidelity and reputation intact (McKeen 1981).

== Cobham and the Main Plot ==
Contemporary accounts portray Cobham as a good natured but unintelligent man. He opposed the ascension of James I to the throne, along with Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton. Cobham&#x27;s dislike of James may have arisen from quarrels over religious policy, but Lord Grey was anti-Catholic. Cobham shows little political activity prior to James&#x27;s time, and he seems generally to have been an uninvolved peer. His brother, Sir George Brooke, on the other hand, was involved in radical religious politics.

In 1603, the first year of James I&#x27;s rule, both Brookes were involved in plots against the king. George Brooke entered into the Bye Plot with two Catholic priests, William Watson and William Clark, to kidnap the king and privy council, and force them to ease the political persecution of English Catholics.

At the very same time, Grey and Cobham entered into the Main Plot to raise a regiment of soldiers and force a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. Cobham and Grey were to raise one-hundred and sixty thousand pounds (a figure that could be safely multiplied by twenty to convert to contemporary money) to bribe or hire an army. Cobham was to be the go-between with the Princely Count of Arenberg, who would do the actual negotiations with the Spanish court for the money. The conspirators, upon seizing government, would depose James and put Lady Arabella Stuart on the throne in his stead.

It is very likely that none of the offers from the Princely Count Arenberg were in good faith. It is plausible to concede that the Spanish court, already deeply in debt to banks in the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic, with the failure of the Spanish Armada years before, and having lost many of its galleons to English pirates, was in no position to offer such an astronomical sum to a somewhat improbable enterprise. However, Cobham believed the offers. He spoke with Sir Walter Raleigh about contacting Arenberg, and he was readying to set forth.

However, the Bye plot was discovered through its hireling &quot;swordsmen,&quot; and the Bye plot conspirators were imprisoned. George Brooke may have sought to avoid a death sentence by informing on his brother. In any case, he provided information on the Main plot, and Grey, Cobham, and Raleigh were imprisoned in the Tower. During the trial, the evidence was shown to be inconsistent, especially in regard to Raleigh. The Bye plot conspirators were executed in 1603, and the Main plot conspirators were left in the Tower. In 1604 (new style), Cobham&#x27;s honours in the Knights of the Garter were taken down and expelled.

Cobham, aged and sick, was released from the Tower in 1618, and died shortly after in a &quot;dingy apartment in the Minories&quot;.

==Marriage==
In 1601 he married Frances Howard (c.1572–1628), 2nd daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and widow of Henry FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare. After her husband&#x27;s attainder in 1603 the king granted her in 1604 a lease for her life of her husband&#x27;s residence, Cobham Hall in Kent, where she lived &quot;in solitary state&quot; until her death in 1628, having in the meantime taken &quot;no notice whatever of her husband after his trial&quot;.

<text>Trust Us, We&#x27;re Experts: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles with Your Future is a book written by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber. It is published by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. of the Penguin Group. The book focuses on the role experts hired by public relations firms play in quieting public fear with inaccurate or incomplete information when dangerous toxins from industrial processes are released into the environment.

An April 2001 &quot;Village Voice&quot; review of the book says the book is &quot;exhaustively detailed&quot;, &quot;calmly convincing&quot;, and &quot;light on rhetoric&quot;, warning readers that the book may induce &quot;paranoid fatalism&quot; about corporate manipulations.
 Bill Moyers of PBS said &quot;If you want to know how the world wags, and who&#x27;s wagging it, here&#x27;s your answer. Read, get mad, roll up your sleeves, and fight back. Rampton and Stauber have issued a wake-up call we can&#x27;t ignore.&quot;

<doc id="1004417" wikidata="Q1562684" url="?curid=1004417" title="Satiety">
<text>Satiety ( ) is a state or condition of fullness gratified beyond the point of satisfaction, the opposite of hunger. Following satiation (meal termination), satiety is a feeling of fullness lasting until the next meal. When food is present in the GI tract after a meal, satiety signals overrule hunger signals, but satiety slowly fades as hunger increases.

The satiety center in animals is located in ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.

== Mechanism ==
Satiety is signaled through the vagus nerve as well as circulating hormones. During intake of a meal, the stomach must stretch to accommodate this increased volume. This gastric accommodation activates stretch receptors in the proximal (upper) portion of the stomach. These receptors then signal through afferent vagus nerve fibers to the hypothalamus, increasing satiety.

== Signalling factors ==
In addition, as the food moves into the duodenum, duodenal cells release multiple substances that affect digestion and satiety. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin released by the duodenum that inhibits relaxation of the stomach. This inhibition causes increased stretch of the stomach, increasing activation of proximal gastric stretch receptors. It also slows overall gut motility, increasing the duration of satiety. This effect is used to increase weight loss and treat obesity through GLP-1 agonists. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is gut peptide produced by the duodenum in response to fat and proteins. CCK has the effect of slowing gut motility and increasing satiety as well as activating release of pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile from the gallbladder.

<text>Markelo (; ) is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Hof van Twente, about west of Hengelo and south-west of Almelo.

Markelo was a separate municipality between 1818 and 2001, when it became a part of Hof van Twente.

== Overview ==
Markelo developed on the east flank of the . It was first mentioned in 1188 as Marclo, and means either &quot;forest near communal ground&quot; or &quot;forest near border&quot;. The Dutch Reformed Church has a 15th-century tower, but the building dates from 1840. In 1818, it became an independent municipality. In 1840, it was home to 793 people.

In 1836, the gristmill &quot;De Hoop&quot; was built near Markelo. It has been restored in 1991. Markelo used to be an agricultural village, however the eastern side of the village has become a residential zone. In 2001, it became part of Hof van Twente.

== Sports ==
Since 1932, the motor club &quot;Ons Genoegen&quot; organises a motocross in Markelo. Originally the circuit was at Markelose Berg, but in 1947, the venue changed to Herikerberg where the terrain is more uneven. The motocross has turned into an international event.

<text>The Tivoli Variety Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, started life as the Conciliation Hall in 1834. Located on Burgh Quay, Dublin 2; It was built as a meeting place for Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Repeal Association.

In 1897, it was rebuilt as a concert hall called the Grand Lyric Hall and changed name to the Lyric Theatre of Varieties the following year. It became known as the Tivoli in 1901. It was a modest sized music hall with seating for 1252 patrons.

The Tivoli closed in 1928 but for a short time continued to show cine-variety on Sunday nights. It finally closed in 1930, and the building became the home of the &quot;Irish Press&quot; newspaper group.

A replacement Tivoli Theatre opened elsewhere in the city in 1934 and closed in 2019.

<doc id="1004428" wikidata="Q3364212" url="?curid=1004428" title="Gatineau Park">
<text>Gatineau Park () is a federal park located in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada. Administered by the National Capital Commission as part of the National Capital Region, Gatineau Park is a wedge of land extending north and west from the city of Gatineau. With a perimeter of , the park includes parts of the municipalities of Chelsea, Pontiac, La Pêche, and the City of Gatineau. The main entrance to the park is north of downtown Ottawa, Ontario.

The park&#x27;s area has a long history of human inhabitation and usage predating the arrival of European settlers. Its more recent pre-park history includes various forms of human exploitation such as farming, logging, hunting, and industrial activity. The idea of creating a park in the Gatineau Hills for recreational purposes was proposed as early as 1903. In 1938 money was allotted for the acquisition of Gatineau woodlands (for preservation) and the construction of a parkway.

The Government of Canada maintains a conference centre at Meech Lake, known as Willson House, the site of meetings leading to a failed attempt to reform Canada&#x27;s Constitution in 1987, the Meech Lake Accord.

There are significant ongoing controversies about the administration of the park, including its status as the only federal park that is not part of the national parks system, the existence and construction of private residences inside it, residents&#x27; extensive violation of shoreline protection bylaws at Meech Lake, and changes to its boundaries without the knowledge of parliament. For instance, inspection reports carried out by the Municipality of Chelsea in 2013 and 2015 confirm that 119 structures have been built without permit at Meech Lake, and that 80% of Meech Lake residents whose properties were inspected continue to violate county bylaw MRC 137-09 several years after it was adopted.

==History and politics==

Although advocated by Dominion Parks Commissioner James Harkin to be the first national park outside the Rocky Mountains, it remains the only federal park that is not a national park, a situation that has direct repercussions on its ecology, boundaries, and land mass.

Created in 1938, Gatineau is the only federal park not protected by the National Parks Act, largely as a result of former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s caution, fear of criticism, and desire for privacy.

Gatineau Park was not only the first national park advocated for Quebec, it was also intended as the first one outside the Rocky Mountains. As well, it was to be the first national park created by the first parks service in the world, the Dominion Parks Branch.

On December 3, 1913, Dominion Parks Commissioner James B. Harkin wrote to Deputy Minister of the Interior William Cory, arguing for the creation of a nationwide system of parks, the first of which was to be Gatineau Park. In his memo, Harkin said:

:&quot;The East has no national parks like those in the Rockies, and it is proposed that the country develop a broader scheme of parks than exists in any other country […] Bringing into effect the proposed Gatineau Park […] would, I think, most easily commence this scheme.&quot;

A few months later, on Cory&#x27;s suggestion, Harkin wrote Quebec Minister of Mines and Forests Charles Devlin inquiring whether he would help establish a national park in the Gatineau district. Although provincial officials wrote back that the matter would receive their minister&#x27;s immediate attention, Devlin died before he could follow up on Harkin&#x27;s request, and no further response was ever received. With the First World War intervening shortly thereafter, the government of Canada had to tend to more pressing matters.

On April 7, 1927, the idea of creating a Gatineau national park was again raised in the House of Commons, where MPs considered a bill to create the Federal District Commission, which would build parks and parkways on both sides of the Ottawa River. During debate, however, Conservative MP John Edwards accused Prime Minister King of wanting to create a park around his Kingsmere property and ease access to it by building a parkway. Though he denied the charge, the criticism would shape King&#x27;s subsequent decisions regarding the park.

It would take another eleven years for the park to be created in embryonic form on July 1, 1938, as a result of efforts by Percy Sparks of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League. By choosing to create the park through gradual property acquisition, the King government allowed private property to continue existing in Gatineau Park—a situation that has prevented the park from becoming a national park.

Today, the National Capital Commission manages the park, along with all federal lands and buildings in Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region. Its policies on park boundaries, land management and ownership, as well as on residential construction in the park, have been the subject of controversy.

To address these issues, several private members’ bills have been introduced in the Senate and House of Commons since 2005. The federal government also tabled its own Gatineau Park legislation in June 2009 and April 2010. None of the bills tabled so far has been enacted into law.

The latest government legislation on the subject, Bill C-20, was reported back to the House of Commons on November 15, 2010. However, it died on the Order Paper before it could be given third reading when the 40th parliament was dissolved.

In the fall of 2010, a controversy broke out in the press pertaining to the rehabilitation of Trail no. 1 in Gatineau Park. According to published reports, the contractor hired by the NCC had laced the trail with broken glass and other debris; the NCC reacted to this news by hiring an engineering firm to study the problem. Its report concluded that garbage spread along the trail was within acceptable standards, a conclusion that park advocates met with scepticism. The NCC also confirmed staff for the contractor were not certified in the maintenance of summer trails in the park, as required by their contract.

More recently, on April 30, 2014, the Conservative government defeated the latest private member&#x27;s bill pertaining to Gatineau Park, a bill that had been tabled by Hull-Aylmer NDP MP Nycole Turmel. The Conservatives argued that the bill (C-565) was too restrictive, since it applied only to Gatineau Park and not to other green space in the National Capital Region. They also said they voted against it because they intended to re-introduce their own legislation in the near term. According to park activists, C-565, though seriously flawed, should have been sent to committee for study and amendment.

Building on the work of the predecessor Federal Woodlands Preservation League, the modern-day New Woodlands Preservation League and its Gatineau Park Protection Committee advocate greater public access to the park while opposing residential development inside it.

==Sites and activities==


Gatineau Park is a recreational destination offering public facilities including beaches, campgrounds, picnic areas, trails, and parkways. There are of hiking trails and of trails for mountain bikes and the Trans Canada Trail passes through the park. The park is also popular with cyclists where many routes are quite steep and very demanding on legs, heart and lungs.

Beaches are located at Meech Lake, Lac Phillipe and La Pêche Lake. While no camping is allowed at Meech Lake, there are campgrounds at the other two lakes. All three lakes are open to canoeists, but gas motor boats are only allowed at Meech Lake due to the presence of many private properties.

Cross-country skiing is one of the park&#x27;s main recreational activities. Nearly of cross-country trails criss-cross the park, which hosts the annual Gatineau Loppet ski race (formerly known as Keskinada Loppet). Downhill skiing and snowboarding are engaged in at Camp Fortune.

During the summer months, Camp Fortune offers an aerial experience including ziplines and treetop obstacles.

Although the practice is not formally permitted in the park, some of the more secluded corners are popular with nudists. In particular there is an unofficial nude beach that has been in use since the late 1930s. Located northwest of parking lot P11 on trail 36, the beach is extensively used by members of Ottawa&#x27;s gay community.

The Mackenzie King Estate, the former summer home of William Lyon Mackenzie King, the tenth Prime Minister of Canada, with its 231 hectares of landscaped green space, is located south of Kingsmere Lake. The cottages, including Kingswood and the primary residence, Moorside, were recently restored and now feature interactive exhibits about Mackenzie King&#x27;s era. There is a café and tea room at the estate. The estate also features the picturesque collection of stone ruins and a small waterfall that runs down the escarpment near Moorside. Mackenzie King donated his estate to the people of Canada at his death in 1950.

Located at Kingsmere, the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada since 1955, and known as The Farm, was part of William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s estate. This rural property consists of a renovated farmhouse and five outbuildings surrounded by 1.74 hectares (4 acres) of fields and forests. The residence is closed to the public, but a virtual tour is available.

Also located inside the park is the Prime Minister of Canada&#x27;s country retreat and official summer residence Harrington Lake, also called Lac Mousseau.

At the end of the Gatineau Parkway, Champlain lookout provides views of the Ottawa Valley from high atop the Eardley Escarpment. When leaves change colour in fall, tourists and locals are drawn to the park&#x27;s lookouts, roads, and pathways to enjoy the autumn scenery.

Pink Lake is a meromictic lake found in the park. Tiny algae in the lake give it a bright green colour. The lake&#x27;s name comes from the Pink family who originally owned property in the area. The park includes many other lakes.

King Mountain, a prominent peak along the Eardley Escarpment at approximately , was the first triangulation point in Canada. The mountain&#x27;s unique positioning provides an interesting spectrum of vegetation ranging from evergreen and deciduous forests to windswept savannas. The mountain is also home to a number of trees which are rare in the area, including some that are nearly 600 years old. For many years, a red-coloured cedar cross was located on top of King Mountain. Originally erected by Old Chelsea&#x27;s parish priest, Father Maguire, it could be seen for miles around. It eventually rotted and fell over the cliff.

==Wildlife==
Gatineau Park provides habitat for many species of birds including the pileated woodpecker and common loon. Turkey vultures and migrating hawks may be observed soaring on the thermals above the Eardley Escarpment. The park is also home to a large population of beavers and white-tailed deer, as well as black bears and two wolf packs in the more remote sections.

<doc id="1004429" wikidata="Q464846" url="?curid=1004429" title="Liam Miller">
<text>Liam William Peter Miller (13 February 1981 – 9 February 2018) was an Irish professional footballer. Miller began his career with Celtic and was later loaned to Aarhus in 2001. He returned to Celtic Park and broke into the first-team squad during the 2003–04 season. Rejecting the offer of a new contract from Celtic, he joined Manchester United in 2004 on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling. Loaned to Leeds United during the 2005–06 season, Miller made 22 first-team appearances for Manchester United.

From 2006 until 2009, he played for Sunderland, followed by a short stay at Queens Park Rangers from January until May 2009, when he was released. Miller joined Hibernian in September of that year on a free transfer. He moved to Australia&#x27;s A-League in 2011 after his contract with Hibernian expired, and represented Perth Glory, Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City there. In 2015, he joined his hometown team Cork City, and a year later Wilmington Hammerheads.

Miller represented the Republic of Ireland team internationally, making his debut in 2004 against the Czech Republic. He earned 21 caps over the next five years, scoring one international goal. Miller died of pancreatic cancer in 2018.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Cork, Ireland, to Billy Miller, a Scot who was a Celtic fan. He grew up in Ovens, County Cork, and attended Coachford College. As a boy, Miller also played Gaelic games for his hometown club Éire Óg and represented Cork GAA at youth level. In a web chat in 2007, Miller said that his family was his largest influence in football, and that Martin O&#x27;Neill and Sir Alex Ferguson were also influential to his career.

==Club career==
===Celtic===
Miller joined Celtic in 1997 as a youth player, and made his professional league debut against Dundee United on 21 May 2000, as a 77th-minute substitute for fellow debutant Ryan McCann. His UEFA Cup debut came against Luxembourg-based club Jeunesse Esch on 24 August 2000 in the second leg of the qualifying round. He came close to scoring in the 64th minute of the 7–0 win (11–0 aggregate). During his time at Celtic Park, he had been on a six-month loan spell with Danish football club AGF Aarhus during the 2001–02 season, making 18 appearances without scoring a goal. They considered signing him permanently for £300,000.

Miller scored his first professional goal on 30 July 2003 in the first leg of the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, coming on as a late substitute to complete a 4–0 win at Lithuania&#x27;s Kaunas. Two months later in the group stage, he scored against Lyon, and subsequently manager Martin O&#x27;Neill offered him a long-term contract, attempting to keep Miller at the club. His first Scottish Premier League goals came in a 5–0 win over Hearts on 18 October, and on 5 November he scored a goal and was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in a 3–1 European win over Anderlecht at Celtic Park. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson attended the game to scout Anderlecht&#x27;s Vincent Kompany, but instead was convinced to approach Miller. Miller was on the pitch as a substitute when Celtic secured the 2003–04 Scottish Premier League title.

Despite his offer of a new contract, Miller signed a pre-contract agreement on 9 January 2004 with English Premier League club Manchester United. This move greatly disappointed O&#x27;Neill, who had intended to build a new Celtic team around Miller.

===Manchester United===
Miller joined Manchester United for free on 1 July 2004, at the expiration of his Celtic contract. He made his United debut on 11 August as a 67th-minute substitute for Darren Fletcher in a 2–1 win at Dinamo Bucharest in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Four days later he made his debut in England&#x27;s top flight, starting in a 1–0 loss at eventual champions Chelsea on the opening day. He scored his first goal for the club on 26 October against Crewe Alexandra in the third round of the League Cup, finishing a pass by David Bellion in a 3–0 win at Gresty Road. After the start of his career for the Red Devils, he found first-team opportunities rare towards the end of the 2004–05 season. He was given a rare first-team start in January 2005 in an FA Cup tie against non-league Exeter City, but turned in a poor performance and was substituted in the second half. In his entire time at the club he made only 22 first-team appearances. Miller later commented that &quot;Man Utd didn&#x27;t work out but I have no regrets about giving it a go.&quot;

On 4 November 2005, Miller joined Championship club Leeds United on loan for three months, though this was later extended to the end of the 2005–06 season. He made his debut at Elland Road the next day by starting in a goalless draw with Preston North End. Miller scored one goal during his time at Leeds, the winning goal in the 4–3 away win against Southampton on 19 November, this coming after Leeds had been 3–0 down with 19 minutes remaining. Miller featured in the play-off final on 21 May 2006, in which his team lost 3–0 to Watford and he was substituted after 62 minutes for David Healy. During his time at Elland Road, he had scored one goal in 28 games.

In July 2006, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Miller would be allowed to leave Manchester United, should the Red Devils receive a suitable offer. On 31 August 2006, he moved to newly relegated Sunderland for free on a three-year deal, joining up with new Sunderland manager and former teammate Roy Keane. He left Manchester United after playing just nine league games in two seasons.

===Sunderland===
Miller made his debut for Sunderland in a 2–1 win over Derby County on 9 September 2006 at Pride Park Stadium, and scored his first goal in the following game against former team Leeds on 13 September in a 3–0 win, shooting across the goalkeeper from 14 yards. On 6 January 2007, he was sent off by referee Iain Williamson in the 37th minute of an FA Cup third round match against Preston, after receiving his second yellow card for a foul on David Nugent; Sunderland went on to lose the match 1–0. Sunderland ended the season as league champions, returning to the Premier League.

Miller scored his first Premier League goal on 22 September 2007 against North-East rivals Middlesbrough in the Tees-Wear derby; his 89th minute 20-yard left-footed shot sealed a 2–2 draw at the Riverside Stadium. He was sent off for the second time in his Sunderland career by Peter Walton; against Chelsea on 8 December for a push on Claudio Pizarro, as the Black Cats lost 2–0.

In February 2008, Keane placed Miller on the transfer list after deeming him to be surplus to requirements. He was linked with a move to Toronto FC, a Canadian club with ties to former Sunderland players Danny Dichio, Carl Robinson and Andy Welsh.

===Queens Park Rangers===
Miller received interest in January 2009 as Championship club Queens Park Rangers expressed their wishes to secure a loan deal. Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia said &quot;There&#x27;s been some interest in Liam from QPR, so something might happen there&quot;. On 15 January, Miller signed a permanent contract until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee.

He made his debut 12 days later, starting in a 3–0 win at Blackpool. On 19 May, QPR released Miller along with five other players.

===Hibernian===
Miller was left without a club after the summer transfer window closed on 31 August 2009, and he was training with clubs in Ireland to maintain his fitness. He called Hibernian manager John Hughes to offer his services. Hughes, who was surprised that Miller was available to him on a free transfer, offered a two-year contract that Miller signed on 11 September. Miller quickly established himself in the Hibs first team, with Graham Spiers describing him as the &quot;king of Hibs&quot; after a 1–1 draw against Rangers at Ibrox. His early performances for Hibs were rewarded with the SPL player of the month award for October 2009. On 20 February, he was sent off in the first half of a 1–0 loss at Motherwell for fouling Jim O&#x27;Brien. Despite a downturn in form, Hibs finished fourth in the 2009–10 Scottish Premier League and qualified for European competition. Miller was named in the PFA Scotland Team of the Year for 2009–10.

Miller&#x27;s form also went into a slump during 2010, and poor results at the start of the 2010–11 season led to the departure of Hughes in October. Miller was sent off near the end of a 2–1 loss at Kilmarnock on 18 December for a foul on Conor Sammon, but on appeal the punishment was reduced to a yellow card. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and Miller was left out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player. On 3 April, his penalty opened the scoring in a 2–2 draw against Hearts in the Edinburgh derby at Easter Road. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract and he left at the end of the season.

===Australia===
Australian A-League club Perth Glory signed Miller on a two-year contract on 3 June 2011. He made his debut on 9 October, playing the full 90 minutes as the season began with a 1–0 win over Adelaide United at the Perth Oval. On 20 November, he received a straight red card in the first half of a 2–2 draw at Melbourne Victory for denying Archie Thompson a clear goalscoring opportunity. He scored his first goal in Australia on 29 January 2012, concluding a 3–0 win at Adelaide. On 22 April, he played the entirety of the 2012 A-League Grand Final, which his team lost 2–1 at Brisbane Roar. A report from Radio Australia noted how Miller and midfield partner Jacob Burns were &quot;outstanding in leading the Glory&#x27;s well-structured and hardworking defensive set-up which stifled the Roar&#x27;s fluid style&quot;, until he conceded a penalty with a foul on Besart Berisha at the end of the match, from which the Brisbane player scored the winning goal.

On 17 April 2013, it was announced Miller would not be signing a new deal with Perth, despite an offer being on the table. He joined Brisbane on a free transfer on a two-year deal on 22 May. Miller started for the A-League All Stars in the inaugural A-League All Stars Game against Manchester United on 20 July, losing 5–1 to his former team at the Stadium Australia in Sydney. On 4 May, he played in the 2014 A-League Grand Final at Lang Park, a 2–1 extra-time win over Western Sydney Wanderers.

On 30 October 2014, Miller was released by Brisbane Roar after asking to have his contract terminated following being dropped from the squad for two games with no explanation, which he found unprofessional and disrespectful.

Eleven days after leaving the Roar, Miller signed for another A-League club, Melbourne City, on a short-term contract as a National Replacement Player in place of Aaron Mooy, joining fellow former Irish international Damien Duff. After playing a good game for on his short-term contract, Miller signed another contract with Melbourne City as an Injury Replacement Player in place of Jonatan Germano until the end of December.

===Later career===
Miller joined League of Ireland outfit Cork City on 15 January 2015, choosing his hometown club over several offers in Asia. Miller made his debut on 7 March as the season began with a 1–1 draw at Sligo Rovers. Miller was a regular in his only season at Turners Cross, in which his team finished as runners-up in the league and the FAI Cup to Dundalk, and on 19 January 2016 he chose to leave.

He signed with American third-tier United Soccer League side Wilmington Hammerheads on 18 February 2016. He made 27 total appearances for the North Carolina–based club, scoring a last-minute equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Orlando City B on 24 July.

In 2017, Miller held an assistant coaching role at Real Monarchs, a USL affiliate of Real Salt Lake. He left in November due to his cancer treatment.

==International career==
Miller was part of the Irish squad that won the UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship in 1998. He made nine appearances for the Republic of Ireland at under-16 level. He then progressed to the Ireland under-21 team. He was fielded in a game against Albania in 2003 despite having been suspended after receiving two yellow cards in UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship games against Switzerland and Albania. The Football Association of Ireland admitted the mistake and apologised to UEFA.

Miller&#x27;s debut for the senior team came on 31 March 2004 against Czech Republic in a 2–1 win at Lansdowne Road; he came on as a substitute for Matt Holland. His first goal for Ireland came in a 3–0 win over Sweden on 1 March 2006 where he made a run and a 25-yard shot rifled into the top of the net. Despite Miller being without a club during the summer of 2009, manager Giovanni Trapattoni continued to select him for the Ireland squad. Miller later commented that &quot;I am very grateful to the manager. He didn&#x27;t need to pick me in the squad but he showed faith in me and I&#x27;m delighted with that&quot;.

==Personal life==
Miller and his wife Clare had three children together – two sons and a daughter.

==Death==
In November 2017, it was made public that Miller was receiving treatment for pancreatic cancer. He had chemotherapy at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City before returning to Ireland. He died on 9 February 2018, only four days shy of his 37th birthday.

A benefit football match was played on 25 September 2018, with the intention of raising funds for Miller&#x27;s family and charities. The Gaelic Athletic Association permitted the game to be played at Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork, which would not normally have been allowed under GAA rules. The match, between a Manchester United XI and a team composed of former Celtic and Republic of Ireland players, ended with the United XI winning on penalties following a 2–2 draw.

<doc id="1004432" wikidata="Q7604259" url="?curid=1004432" title="Towradgi, New South Wales">
<text>Towradgi () is a small beach-side suburb approximately north of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Towradgi is derived from the Dharawal word &quot;Kow-radgi&quot;, meaning &quot;guardian of the sacred stones&quot;. On an early map it was called Towroger. Towradgi is served by electric trains at Towradgi railway station, opened in 1948.

Towradgi is bordered to the north by Corrimal, the west by Fernhill and Tarrawanna, and to the south by Fairy Meadow. The Pacific Ocean can be found to the east. Towradgi has also come to incorporate much of the former suburb of Reidtown (to the south-west), some of which has also been incorporated into Fairy Meadow.

Towradgi has a surf club along with a bowling and recreation club, Chinese restaurant, croquet club, 2 petrol stations, hairdresser, retirement village, Towradgi Public School, train station, many open parks and a rock pool.

One of Towradgi&#x27;s landmarks is the small bridge on Towradgi Road that passes over the south coast train line at Towradgi station. This bridge is affectionately known in the area as &quot;the hump&quot; due to its short and steep rise, and it is not uncommon for some cars to become airborne if they pass over this bridge at a high speed.

East of Towradgi is Towradgi Point, the location of the Towradgi rockpool, a mildly jutting rocky projection to the east. The rockpool itself is at the tip of the point. To the north is the entrance to Towradgi Creek and to the south and north are small areas of rocks, known as &quot;Black Rocks&quot;.

Towradgi Creek goes inland from Corrimal Beach. A short distance out to sea from here is the point where the famous ship, &quot;Queen of Nations&quot;, was wrecked in the 1880s. It lies just north of the pools and, at low tide, a darkish blur marks it. A plaque at the point tells the story of the wreck. The captain, Samuel Bache, who, in his drunken state, thought the Mount Keira coal mine slag heap fires to be the light on Port Jackson&#x27;s South Head in Sydney, crashed the barque clipper vessel on 31 May 1881. The first mate was equally drunk and threatened crew members. It is now a protected wreck site. The ship was transporting alcohol at the time, which explains this accident.

Many go to the point to see the fine views of Wollongong and north to Corrimal, Bellambi Point and the northern escarpment and Sublime Point, as well as views from the park to Knight&#x27;s Hill and the southern mountains. The bridge across the creek was remade in 2006 and is used by cyclists and walkers; here the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track is split into two designated paths.

The point is also home to a park and recreation area with a bike path, part of the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track, and a picnic area. It is a popular spot for surfing and swimming.

South of the point on the beach is the site where George Bass and Matthew Flinders, with their helper Martin, attempted to land. A plaque commemorates when the sea took out their vessel, the Tom Thumb, and filled it with water on 21 March 1796. They managed to bale it out and continue, having collected water from Towradgi Creek.

Erosion from June 2007 storms has damaged the beach and some beach entrance tracks, but most areas with vegetation have borne it well.

==History==
Towradgi is a corruption of a Dharawal word meaning the &quot;guardian of the sacred stones&quot;. On early maps, it was originally known as Towroger, according to Henderson&#x27;s Early Illawarra.

On 26 March 1796, just south of Towradgi Point, George Bass and Matthew Flinders, along with their young helper Martin made an attempted landing on the coast. At the same time, European settlers became the first to set foot on the soil of the Illawarra.

Towradgi underwent significant development in the early 1900s. The construction of the South Coast railway line in the late 19th century made the area more accessible, which combined the development of infrastructure like roads, in contribution to its transformation from a rural area to a residential suburb.

Towradgi became part of Wollongong&#x27;s expanding urban area. The period saw a boom in housing and infrastructure development, transforming it into a residential suburb by the late 20th century. The suburb is known for its beach and southern proximity to Wollongong’s city centre, providing a mix of residential areas and natural beauty.

Today, Towradgi is a popular beachside suburb, in proximity to the larger urban centres of Wollongong and the Illawarra region.

<text>is Roland&#x27;s senior managing director and head of its R&amp;D center. He designed the TB-303 bass synthesizer and the TR-909 drum machine. He was also the chief engineer of the Roland TR-808 drum machine.

==Roland TR-808==
===Design===
The Roland TR-808, a programmable drum machine, was launched in 1980. The TR-808 included unique artificial percussion sounds, such as “the hum kick, the ticky snare, the tishy hi-hats (open and closed) and the spacey cowbell.”

The machine is particularly noted for its powerful booming bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods, which can be used to create basslines or bass drops. It was the first drum machine with the ability to program an entire percussion track of a song from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls. The machine includes volume knobs for each voice, multiple audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices via the Digital Control Bus (DCB) interface, considered groundbreaking at the time. The machine has three trigger outputs, used to synchronize/control synthesizers and other equipment.

===Impact===
The TR-808 would become a fixture of the burgeoning underground dance, electro, house, techno, R&amp;B and hip-hop genres, mainly because of their relatively low cost and the unique character of their analogue-generated sounds. It was first utilized by Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra in the year of its release, after which it would gain worldwide popularity with Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and Afrikaa Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; in 1982.

The track informed the development of pop-oriented electronic music and of hip hop music, and genres including electro, Miami bass, and Detroit techno. The 808 was instrumental to the origins of house and techno, and remains a staple of electronic dance music.

Producer Rick Rubin and hip hop group Original Concept popularized the technique of lengthening the bass drum decay and tuning it to different pitches to create basslines. The technique was adopted by Miami bass producers, who also used the 808 to produce a bass drop, which has since been incorporated into a number of hip hop and dance genres, either produced by an 808 or using a sample of an 808 bass drop. The Bomb Squad popularized the use of samplers to manipulate the 808 bass, which became common in hip hop music. Dynamix II popularized this technique in dance music, which has since used the 808 sub-bass extensively, in genres such as trap, deep house and drum and bass. 808 samples were the basis for jungle and drum and bass, which developed from British producers using samplers to manipulate 808 sounds.

The analogue-based Roland machines have endured over time. The beats of the TR-808 have since been widely featured in popular music, and can be heard on countless recordings up to the present day. Because of its bass and long decay, the kick drum from the TR-808 has also featured as a bass line in various genres such as hip hop and drum and bass. Since the mid-1980s, the TR-808 and TR-909 have been used on more hit records than any other drum machines, attaining an iconic status within the music industry.

==Roland TR-909==
While the TR-808 was fully analogue synthesis-based, the Roland TR-909 combined analogue synthesis with digital sampling. The TR-909 was also notable for being the first MIDI-equipped drum machine. In turn, the TR-909 was succeeded in 1984 by the Roland TR-707, which was entirely based on digital sampling.

The TR-909 eventually came to be held in reverence by music producers, hip hop music DJs and beatmakers, and techno and other electronic dance music-style DJs. Much like the TR-808&#x27;s importance to hip hop, the TR-909 holds a similar important for dance music, such as techno and house music.

==Roland TB-303==
Tadao Kikumoto&#x27;s invention of the TB-303 in 1981 has been listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music, for its key role in the foundation of acid house. The article described it as one of the &quot;first boxes to define the sound of electronic dance music.&quot;

<doc id="1004441" wikidata="Q349427" url="?curid=1004441" title="Bombesin">
<text>Bombesin is a 14-amino acid peptide originally isolated from the skin of the European fire-bellied toad (&quot;Bombina bombina&quot;) by Vittorio Erspamer &quot;et al.&quot; and named after its source. It has two known homologs in mammals called neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide. It stimulates gastrin release from G cells. It activates three different G-protein-coupled receptors known as BBR1, -2, and -3. It also activates these receptors in the brain. Together with cholecystokinin, it is the second major source of negative feedback signals that stop eating behaviour.

Bombesin is also a tumor marker for small cell carcinoma of lung, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma.

==Receptors==
The anuran receptor homologue is termed (). Iwabuchi &quot;et al.&quot; 2003 discovered a chicken (&quot;Gallus domesticus&quot;) receptor which is homologous to both the and fBB4 and so they named it .

==Effects==
Erspamer 1988 finds bombesin has a similar effect on the chicken to ranatensin, unreliably increasing or decreasing blood pressure.

<text>The Mechanics&#x27; Hall, also known as the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties, was a theatre and music hall in Lower Abbey Street, Dublin. It stood at the site of the current Abbey Theatre at 26 Lower Abbey Street.

A theatre or circus has stood on this site on Lower Abbey Street since at least the early 19th century. In the mid-19th century, at the urging of Dublin&#x27;s gentry, John Classon, an upper-class merchant, acquired the buildings then on the site, one of which had housed a circus, in order to establish a joint concert hall and civic institution for the lower classes. Those buildings became the Music Hall and the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. The Music Hall, which could seat 4000 persons, hosted concerts, lectures, and popular entertainments. The renowned black American abolitionist Frederick Douglass lectured at the Music Hall in 1845 during a four-month visit to Ireland. In 1850 and 1851 Pablo Fanque, the popular black equestrian and circus owner (immortalised later in The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;) played to near-capacity Dublin crowds for weeks. During a March 1851 performance of Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal police were called in to quell a riot when playgoers threatened to riot and destroy the theatre in protest to the winner of a &quot;conundrum&quot; contest.

In the later 19th century, in the 1860s, the Music Hall was renamed the Mechanics&#x27; Theatre, after the adjacent Mechnanic&#x27;s Institute. Mary Browne, mother of Shaun Glenville was manager of the theatre for a time. Seán O&#x27;Casey once appeared on stage there in a production of &quot;The Shaughraun&quot; by Dion Boucicault. The theatre was also known during this time as the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties, a name it retained until the building was acquired for the Abbey Theatre at the beginning of the 20th century.

<text>Richard Daniel Hughes (born 25 June 1979) is a Scottish professional football executive and former player who is currently working as a sporting director for Premier League club Liverpool FC.

Hughes played as a defensive midfielder, and started his professional career as a junior in Italy for Atalanta, before moving to Arsenal and Bournemouth, where he made his professional debut. He most prominently featured for Portsmouth from 2002 until 2011 and had a brief loan spell with Grimsby Town in 2003. After a year out of the game, Hughes signed again for Bournemouth. He finally retired from playing in May 2014, aged 34. He was capped five times by Scotland.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Born in Scotland, Hughes grew up in Italy and began his career as a youth player at Serie A side Atalanta. After moving back to the United Kingdom, Hughes spent five years with Arsenal as a youth player. He did not make the transition to the first team and so left the club to join AFC Bournemouth in the summer of 1998.

Hughes made his debut for Bournemouth in a 2–0 victory over Lincoln City, and became a regular member of the first team. He was signed by Portsmouth for £50,000 in summer 2002.

===Portsmouth===
After making his debut for Portsmouth in a 1–1 draw at Sheffield United, Hughes was loaned out to Grimsby Town, where he played 12 games and scored one goal against Brighton. He was given a Premier League appearance in December 2003, and he remained a squad member for the remainder of the 2003–04 campaign. He scored the winning goal, his first for Portsmouth, in a 1–0 FA Cup victory over Liverpool on 22 February 2004. On 28 July 2006 he pledged his future to the club, signing a three-year contract. On 15 August 2007, playing against Manchester United, Hughes was headbutted by Cristiano Ronaldo, after Hughes allegedly provoked him. Ronaldo was red-carded for his actions. The game finished 1–1. Hughes was part of Portsmouth&#x27;s 2007–08 FA Cup-winning team. Despite not making the squad for the final he appeared in the earlier rounds.

In January 2009, Hughes was offered an extension to his Portsmouth contract. His second competitive goal for Portsmouth came when he scored in a 4–1 League Cup win against Hereford on 25 August 2009. Hughes&#x27; first league goal for Portsmouth came in a 3–3 draw against Leeds United at Elland Road on 28 December 2010, his last game for the club. The Scottish midfielder&#x27;s strike deflected off Leeds defender Andy O&#x27;Brien on its way into the net. Originally awarded as an own goal to O&#x27;Brien, the goal was subsequently credited to Hughes by the dubious goals committee as his first league goal for the club. Hughes played his last game for Portsmouth on 28 December 2010. Under the terms of his contract, signed when Portsmouth were still in the Premier League, he was entitled to a new contract with increased wages if he had played one more game. As Portsmouth could not afford to fulfil the original offer, and he was not prepared to accept alternative terms; he remained at Portsmouth without playing in the second half of the 2010–11 season. He was subsequently released at the end of the season.

===Return to Bournemouth===
In the summer of 2012, a year after retiring from the game, Hughes was convinced to come out of retirement by Paul Groves, who managed him at Grimsby and was assistant manager while Hughes was at Portsmouth. In turn he re-joined Bournemouth following Groves&#x27; appointment as manager. Hughes made his second debut for Bournemouth in a 5–3 loss at Sheffield United on 1 September 2012, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Shaun MacDonald. On 8 September, Hughes scored the only goal in the match against Yeovil, securing Bournemouth their first League One victory. In May 2014, with his contract due to expire, Hughes took the decision to retire aged 34.

===International play===
Hughes gained recognition for his performances at Bournemouth with a call-up to represent Scotland at under-21 level. His performances also earned him selection for the Scottish senior side, and he won his first cap against Estonia in May 2004.

==Post-retirement football career==
Following his retirement from the game, Hughes later joined Bournemouth&#x27;s recruitment team under Eddie Howe and was promoted to Technical Director during the club&#x27;s stay in the Premier League. On 5 March 2024, AFC Bournemouth announced Hughes would leave the club at the end of the 2023–24 season. On 20 March, Liverpool announced that Hughes would become their sporting director on 1 June.

==Personal life==
Hughes&#x27; father worked for Penguin Books in Italy and the family lived in Milan although his mother moved back to Glasgow for a month to give birth.

Attending a British school in the city, Hughes spoke English in the home and school and Italian when out with friends. Initially playing football for local boys teams he was invited to sign for AC Milan at the age of ten. However, he turned them down, later saying it was because at the time he was very shy. A year later Hughes was picked up by the Atalanta youth system and spent seven years with the club, before moving to Arsenal in late 1993.

Hughes revealed he planned on life after retirement, working for BT Sport as a pundit and running a restaurant with his brother called Mele e Pere and based in Brewer Street, Soho, London.

<text>The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 is a British biplane fighter aircraft of the First World War. It was developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory by a team consisting of Henry Folland, John Kenworthy and Major Frank Goodden. It was one of the fastest aircraft of the war, while being both stable and relatively manoeuvrable. According to aviation author Robert Jackson, the S.E.5 was: &quot;the nimble fighter that has since been described as the &#x27;Spitfire of World War One&#x27;&quot;.

In most respects the S.E.5 had superior performance to the rival Sopwith Camel, although it was less immediately responsive to the controls. Problems with its Hispano-Suiza engine, particularly the geared-output H-S 8B-powered early versions, meant that there was a chronic shortage of the type until well into 1918. Thus, while the first examples had reached the Western Front before the Camel, there were fewer squadrons equipped with the S.E.5 than with the Sopwith fighter.

Together with the Camel, the S.E.5 was instrumental in regaining allied air superiority in mid-1917 and maintaining it for some time, ensuring there was no repetition of &quot;Bloody April&quot; 1917 when losses in the Royal Flying Corps were much heavier than in the Luftstreitkräfte. The S.E.5s remained in RAF service for some time following the Armistice that ended the conflict; some were transferred to various overseas military operators, while a number were also adopted by civilian operators.

==Development==
===Origins===

The S.E.5 (Scout Experimental 5) was designed by Henry Folland, John Kenworthy and Major Frank Goodden of the Royal Aircraft Factory in Farnborough. It was built around the new 150 hp (112 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8, a V8 engine that, while providing excellent performance, was initially underdeveloped and unreliable. The first of three prototypes flew on 22 November 1916. The first two prototypes were lost in crashes (the first killing the chief test pilot at the Royal Aircraft Factory, Major Frank Goodden, on 28 January 1917) due to a weakness in their wing design. The third prototype underwent modification before production commenced; the S.E.5 was known in service as an exceptionally strong aircraft which could be dived at very high speed – the squarer wings also gave much improved lateral control at low airspeeds.

Like the other significant Royal Aircraft Factory aircraft of the war (B.E.2, F.E.2 and R.E.8) the S.E.5 was inherently stable, making it an excellent gunnery platform, but it was also quite manoeuvrable. It was one of the fastest aircraft of the war at 138 mph (222 km/h), equal at least in speed to the SPAD S.XIII and faster than any standard German type of the period. While the S.E.5 was not as agile and effective in a tight dogfight as the Camel it was much easier and safer to fly, particularly for novice pilots. According to &quot;Dodge&quot; Bailey, the former Chief Test Pilot of the Shuttleworth Collection, it had &quot;somewhat similar handling characteristics to a de Havilland Tiger Moth, but with better excess power&quot;.

===S.E.5a===
Only 79 original S.E.5 aircraft had been completed prior to production settling upon an improved model, designated as the &quot;S.E.5a&quot;. The initial models of the S.E.5a differed from late production examples of the S.E.5 only in the type of engine installed – a geared 200 hp Hispano-Suiza 8b, often turning a large clockwise-rotation four-bladed propeller, replacing the 150 hp H.S. 8A model. In total 5,265 S.E.5s were constructed by six manufacturers: Austin Motors (1,650), Air Navigation and Engineering Company (560), Curtiss (1), Martinsyde (258), the Royal Aircraft Factory (200), Vickers (2,164) and Wolseley Motors Limited (431).

Shortly following the American entry into World War I, plans were mooted for several American aircraft manufacturers to commence mass production of aircraft already in service with the Allied powers, one such fighter being the S.E.5. In addition to an order of 38 Austin-built S.E.5a aircraft which were produced in Britain and assigned to the American Expeditionary Force to equip already-deployed US Army squadrons, the US Government issued multiple orders to the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company for the manufacture and delivery of around 1,000 S.E.5s to be produced in the United States. However, only one Curtiss-built aircraft would be completed prior to the end of the conflict, after which demand for the S.E.5 had effectively evaporated, production being quickly halted after a further 56 aircraft were assembled using already-delivered components.

At first, airframe construction outstripped the very limited supply of French-built Hispano-Suiza engines and squadrons earmarked to receive the new fighter had to soldier on with Airco DH 5s and Nieuport 24s until early 1918. The troublesome geared &quot;-8b&quot; model was prone to have serious gear reduction system problems, sometimes with the propeller (and even the entire gearbox on a very few occasions) separating from the engine and airframe in flight, a problem shared with the similarly-powered Sopwith Dolphin. The introduction of the 200 hp (149 kW) Wolseley Viper, a high-compression, direct-drive version of the Hispano-Suiza 8a made under licence by Wolseley Motors Limited, solved the S.E.5a&#x27;s engine problems and was promptly adopted as the type&#x27;s standard powerplant. A number of aircraft were subsequently converted to a two-seat configuration in order to serve as trainer aircraft.

===S.E.5b===

The S.E.5b was a variant of the S.E.5 with a streamlined nose and upper and lower wings of different span and chord. The single example, a converted S.E.5a, first flew in early April 1918. It had a spinner on the propeller and a retractable underslung radiator. Its performance was little better than the S.E.5a, with the extra drag of the big upper wing offsetting gains from the more streamlined fuselage. The S.E.5b was not considered for production. In January 1919, it was tested with standard S.E.5a wings and in this form survived as a research aircraft into the early twenties.

==Design==
The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 was a conventional tractor biplane fighter aircraft. The fuselage was a wire-braced box girder structure while the wings were furnished with wooden spars and internal ribs. The fuselage was narrower than many contemporary aircraft, which provided the pilot with good all-round visibility. The aircraft had considerable structural strength, which was credited with improving the type&#x27;s crashworthiness and survivability. It could also withstand high-g manoeuvres and was relatively resistant to battle-damage.

Unlike many of its peers, which were highly agile but unforgiving, the S.E.5 was comparatively stable and easy to fly; its stability enabling pilots to more readily fire upon enemies from further away with a greater degree of accuracy. It had a noticeably lower accident rate than comparable aircraft. The exception to its generally stability was an excessive amount of adverse yaw. The yaw could be compensated for by balanced application of the aileron and rudder, whilst adjustment of the elevator trim made it possible to fly in a &#x27;hands off&#x27; manner. 

The S.E.5 was powered by various engines, initially adopting a Hispano-Suiza 8 V8 engine. The Hispano-Suiza engine was advanced for the era, incorporating such features as an aluminium cylinder block with steel liners, dual ignition and forced lubrication that aided cooling; especially compared with contemporary rotary engines, it had the advantage of being easy to operate by most pilots. An expansion tank for the cooling system was integrated into the leading edge of the upper wing&#x27;s centre section. One of its greatest advantages over the Sopwith Camel was its superior performance at altitude, making it a much better match for the Fokker D.VII when that fighter arrived at the front.

The S.E.5 was armed with a single synchronised .303-inch Vickers machine gun in contrast to the Camel&#x27;s two, but it also had a wing-mounted Lewis gun fitted on a Foster mounting, which enabled the pilot to fire at an enemy aircraft from below. This armament configuration was much appreciated by the pilots of the first S.E.5 squadrons as the new hydraulic-link &quot;C.C.&quot; synchronising gear for the Vickers machine gun was unreliable at first. The Vickers gun was mounted on the forward left dorsal surface of the fuselage with the breech inside the cockpit, at a slight upwards angle. Typically, spare magazines for the Lewis gun would have been placed within most of the free space in the cockpit including the forward areas, such as the instrumentation panel.

The standard instrument panel included a compass, altimeter, tachometer, oil pressure indicator, airspeed gauge, radiator temperature dial, fuel air pressure indicator, fuel selector, and air exchange; these were somewhat difficult to view due to their low-set position in the cockpit. According to &quot;Dodge&quot; Bailey, Chief Test Pilot of the Shuttleworth Collection, the S.E.5&#x27;s cockpit was &quot;the best of the bunch from the era&quot;. It was set amidships, making it difficult to see over the long front fuselage, but otherwise visibility was good. 

Individual in-service S.E.5s would often receive customisations and user-specified tweaks at the request of their pilots. Popular changes included reducing the dihedral of the wings in order to increase its manoeuvrability and the removal of the head fairing to increase the pilot&#x27;s visibility to the rear. James McCudden, an ace pilot and former RFC mechanic, was famous for his prolific fine-tuning of his aircraft in order to produce improved performance from it; McCudden was able to increase the top speed by 9 mph and to raise the service ceiling from the standard 17,000 ft to 20,000 ft. His adaptions included replacing the standard pistons with high compression versions, shortening the exhaust (saving weight and improving exhaust scavenging), and changes to mixture, ignition and other engine settings as well as fitting a salvaged German propeller spinner (which he himself credited as gaining 3 mph alone).

Aviation authors Donald Nijboer and Dan Patterson describe the S.E.5 as &quot;arguably the best British-built fighter of World War I&quot;.

==Operational history==

In March 1917, the S.E.5 entered service with No. 56 Squadron RFC, although the squadron did not deploy to the Western Front until the following month. Everyone was suspicious of the large &quot;greenhouse&quot; windscreens fitted to the first production models. These were designed to protect the pilot in his unusually high seating position, which was in turn intended to improve vision over the upper wing. The squadron did not fly its first patrol with the S.E.5 until 22 April, by which time, on the insistence of Major Blomfield, 56 squadron&#x27;s commanding officer, all aircraft had been fitted with small rectangular screens of conventional design. The problem of the high seating position was solved by simply lowering it, pilots in any case preferring a more conventional (and comfortable) seating position. No complaints seem to have been made about the view from the cockpit; in fact, this was often cited as one of the strong points of the type.

While pilots, some of whom were initially disappointed with the S.E.5, quickly came to appreciate its strength and fine flying qualities, it was popularly judged to have been underpowered; this failing was addressed by the introduction of the more powerful S.E.5a. In June 1917, the S.E.5a entered service and quickly began to replace the S.E.5. At this time 56 Squadron was still the only unit flying the new fighter; in fact it was the only operational unit to be fully equipped with the initial 150 hp S.E.5 – all other S.E.5 squadrons officially used the 200 hp S.E.5a from the outset – although a few S.E.5s were issued to other squadrons due to an acute shortage of the S.E.5a. Deliveries of the S.E.5a suffered from delays due to a shortage of available engines with which to power the type.

Due to the shortage of aircraft, there was a very slow initial build-up of new S.E.5a squadrons, which lasted well into 1918. Once the Wolseley Viper-powered model became plentiful, many more units were re-equipped with the type. By the end of the war, the S.E.5a was employed by a total of 21 British Empire squadrons as well as two U.S. units. Many of the top Allied aces of the Great War flew this fighter, including Billy Bishop, Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor, Edward Mannock and James McCudden. Legendary British ace Albert Ball was initially disparaging of the S.E.5, but in the end claimed 11 of his 44 victories flying it. McCudden wrote of the S.E.5: &quot;It was very fine to be in a machine that was faster than the Huns, and to know that one could run away just as things got too hot.&quot;

Sholto Douglas who commanded No. 84 Squadron RFC which was initially equipped with the S.E.5a, listed the type&#x27;s qualities as being: &quot;Comfortable, with a good all-round view, retaining its performance and manoeuvrability at high level, steady and quick to gather speed in the dive, capable of a very fine zoom, useful in both offence and defence, strong in design and construction, [and] possessing a reliable engine&quot;.

Soon after the Armistice the S.E.5a was withdrawn from RAF service. It was retained for a time in Canada, and in 1921 a Viper-engined S.E.5a was taken to Japan by the British Aviation Mission to the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Australia received 35 S.E.5a under the Imperial Gift in 1919, and the type went on to be the newly formed R.A.A.F.’s main fighter type until the late 1920’s.

A number of machines found roles in civilian flying after the war. On 30 May 1922, the first use of skywriting for advertising occurred when Cyril Turner, a former RAF officer, spelt out &quot;London Daily Mail&quot; in black smoke from an S.E.5a at The Derby. Others were used for air racing; one such privately owned aircraft won the Morris Cup race in 1927.

==Surviving aircraft and replicas==
===Originals===
An original S.E.5a may be seen at the Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden, England, UK. This aircraft was originally serial &quot;F904&quot; of No. 84 Squadron RAF, then flew as &quot;G-EBIA&quot; from September 1923 to February 1932. It was stored between 1933 and 1955, before being restored to a flightworthy condition by staff at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and then passed onto the Shuttleworth Collection. An extensive refurbishment of this aircraft was performed in 2007. It has been re-registered as &quot;G-EBIA&quot;, it was first painted as &quot;D7000&quot;, then as &quot;F904&quot;.

An original S.E.5e may be seen in the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Dayton, Ohio, USA. The museum acquired the S.E.5e through a donation by the estate of Lt. Col. William C. Lambert, USAF Ret, a First World War ace with 21.5 victories. Lambert flew the S.E.5a as an American member of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force. The Air Force Museum Foundation also helped buy the aircraft. It is painted to represent an S.E.5e of the 18th Headquarters Squadron, Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., in 1925.

Another four original airframes are statically displayed at: the Science Museum, London, UK; Royal Air Force Museum, London, UK; South African National Museum of Military History, Johannesburg, South Africa; and the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia.

===Reproductions===
Two full-scale replica S.E.5a aircraft were built by Miles Aircraft in 1965 for use in film making and were transferred to the Irish civil aircraft register in 1967 while the two were employed in flying scenes for the 1966 war movie The Blue Max.

Three flightworthy reproductions (designated SE5a-1), along with a single static example, were constructed by The Vintage Aviator Limited in New Zealand. According to the group, the reproduction aircraft, which was the company&#x27;s first project, combined some authentic components, such as the Hispano engines used, with newly-fabricated parts based on original archived drawings.

The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, US displays the reproduction SE.5a that Bobby Strahlman and his partners completed for collector Doug Champlin in 1989. This reproduction features one .303 Vickers and one .303-calibre Lewis machine gun, and carries the paint scheme of American ace George Vaughn who served with the Royal Flying Corps. The SE.5 was displayed at Champlin&#x27;s fighter museum at Mesa, Arizona, US until the collection was transferred to Seattle in 2003.

==Fictional portrayals==

The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 has been portrayed, both by original and replica aircraft, in various movies. These include &quot;Wings&quot; (1927), &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930), &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933), &quot;Crimson Romance&quot; (1934), &quot;Test Pilot&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). Converted &quot;Stampe et Vertongen&quot; SV.4 trainer/tourer aircraft were used to portray S.E.5s in the 1976 Anglo-French production &quot;Aces High&quot;.

The 1971 film &quot;Zeppelin&quot; makes reference to the use of the S.E.5 as a weapon to defend against the German Zeppelins that were attacking Britain during the First World War. The film, however, is set in the fall of 1915, a full year-and-a-half before the S.E. 5 entered squadron service. The dogfight scene near the film&#x27;s conclusion features S.E.5a replicas.

<text>Sir Ivor Anthony Roberts (born 24 September 1946) is a retired British diplomat and the former President of Trinity College, Oxford. He was previously British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Ireland, and Italy. He was knighted in 2000. In addition to his British citizenship, he is now an Irish citizen.

==Education==
Born in Liverpool, Roberts was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Crosby and the University of Oxford (Keble College, now Honorary Fellow), graduating with a degree in Modern Languages in 1968 and proceeded to take his MA in 1972.

==Diplomatic career==
Roberts joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) as Third Secretary in 1968. He went to study Arabic at MECAS in the Lebanon in 1969, and was posted to Paris in 1970. He was acting Head of Chancery in Luxembourg in 1973 before returning later that year to the FCO to serve firstly in Eastern European and Soviet Department (Balkans desk), then in Western European Department (German desk) and subsequently in European Integration Department, where he worked on the European Community&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy and the European Parliament. He was appointed First Secretary at the British High Commission in Canberra in 1978. In 1980 he was posted temporarily to the newly independent Pacific state of Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides) as Political Adviser at the time of a rebellion. He returned to Canberra as Head of the Economic and Commercial Department and Agricultural Adviser until 1982. He then returned to London and took up the post of Deputy Head of News Department in the FCO.

From 1989 to 1993 he was Minister in the British Embassy in Madrid. He was appointed Chargé d&#x27;Affaires and Consul-General in Belgrade in March 1994, and after recognition of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the United Kingdom, he became Ambassador. During his time at Belgrade he conducted negotiations on behalf of the international mediators (David Owen and Carl Bildt) with both the Yugoslav authorities and the Bosnian Serbs.

Roberts was also involved in the negotiations for the release of British soldiers held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs in May/June 1995. He left Belgrade at the end of 1997. In 1998–99 he took a sabbatical year as Senior Associate Member of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Roberts returned as Ambassador to Ireland 1999–2003, and to Italy from March 2003 until his retirement in 2006.

==After retirement==

After Sir Ivor retired from HM Diplomatic Service in September 2006 he took up the post of President of Trinity College, Oxford.

On 24 September 2006 (his 60th birthday), &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s Pendennis column reported that, following his outspoken valedictory report, the FCO had abandoned the centuries-old tradition of allowing departing diplomats to speak their minds. In April 2007, &quot;The Independent&quot; confirmed the story.

In April 2017, Roberts announced that he had taken Irish citizenship following the Brexit result. The citizenship arises from Roberts&#x27;s father, who was born in Belfast.

==Affiliations==
Sir Ivor was the Chairman of the Council of the British School at Rome and a Patron of the Venice in Peril Fund. He is also a member of the Board of the King&#x27;s College Group in Madrid and was a Member of the International Advisory Board of The Independent News and Media Group.

Roberts is an advisory board member of the Counter Extremism Project.

==Family==
Roberts married Elizabeth Smith, a scholar of French poetry and formerly a diplomat in the Australian Foreign Service, in 1974. Lady Roberts is a writer and lecturer on Balkan politics. The couple have two sons and a daughter.

==Publications==
In 2009, Roberts edited the sixth edition of &quot;Satow&#x27;s Diplomatic Practice&quot;, originally written in 1917 by Sir Ernest Satow and widely used in embassies throughout the world (Oxford University Press: 2009; ). It was reviewed by Sir Jeremy Greenstock later the same year. The seventh centenary edition, also edited by Roberts, appeared in 2017 (). His memoir of his years in the Balkans, &quot;Conversations with Milosevic&quot;, was published in 2016.

<doc id="1004460" wikidata="Q332583" url="?curid=1004460" title="Karim Khan Zand">
<text>Mohammad Karim Khan Zand (; ) was the founder of the Zand dynasty, ruling all of Iran (Persia) except for Khorasan from 1751 to 1779. He also ruled over some of the Caucasian lands and occupied Basra for some years.

While Karim was ruler, Iran recovered from the devastation of 40 years of war, providing the war-ravaged country with a renewed sense of tranquillity, security, peace, and prosperity. The years from 1765 to Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779, marked the zenith of Zand rule. During his reign, relations with Britain were restored, and the East India Company allowed to have a trading post in southern Iran. He made Shiraz his capital and ordered the construction of several architectural projects there.

Following Karim Khan&#x27;s death, civil war broke out once more, and none of his descendants was able to rule the country as effectively as he had. The last of these descendants, Lotf Ali Khan, was executed by Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who became the sole ruler of Iran.

== Background and early life ==
Karim Beg belonged to the Zand tribe, a small and little-known tribe of Laks, a branch of Lurs who may have been originally Kurdish. The Zands were concentrated on the villages of Pari and Kamazan in the Malayer district but were also found roaming in the central Zagros ranges and the countryside of Hamadan. Karim Beg was born in in the village of Pari, then part of the Safavid Empire. He was the eldest son of a certain Inaq Khan Zand, and had 3 sisters, a brother named Mohammad Sadeq Khan, and two half-brothers named Zaki Khan and Eskandar Khan Zand. In 1722, the Safavid Empire was on the verge of collapsing—Isfahan and most of central and east Iran had been seized by the Afghan Hotak dynasty, while the Russians had conquered many cities in northern Iran. Around the same time, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of Iran&#x27;s decadence to conquer a large number of western frontier districts. There they faced bold opposition from the local clans, including the Zands, who under the chief Mehdi Khan Zand harassed their forces and stopped them from advancing further into Iran.

In 1732, Nader Qoli Beg, who had restored Safavid rule in Iran and had become the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country, he made an expedition into the Zagros ranges of western Iran in order to subdue the tribes, whom he considered bandits. He first defeated the Bakhtiari and the Feylis, whom he forced to mass-migrate in larger numbers into Khorasan. He then baited Mehdi Khan Zand and his forces out of their stronghold at Pari, killing the latter and 400 of his Zand kinsmen. The surviving members of the tribe were forced to mass-migrate under the leadership of Inaq Khan Zand and his younger brother Budaq Khan Zand to Abivard and Dargaz, where its able members, including Karim Beig were incorporated into Nader&#x27;s army. 
In 1736, Nader deposed the Safavid ruler Abbas III (r. 1732–1736) and ascended the throne, assuming the name of &quot;Nader Shah&quot;, thus starting the Afsharid dynasty. Karim Beg, who was at this time in his thirties, served as a cavalryman and did not enjoy a high status in the army. Furthermore, he was also deprived of money, which made him commit theft—told by John R. Perry, in summary, as follows:&quot;He used later to tell how, as a poor cavalryman in Nader&#x27;s employ, he once stole a gold-embossed saddle belonging to an Afghan officer from outside a saddler&#x27;s shop, where it had been left for repair. The next day he heard that the saddler had been held responsible for the loss, and was to be executed. Conscience-smitten, Karim surreptitiously replaced the saddle at the shop door, and watched from concealment. The saddler&#x27;s wife was the first to discover; she fell on her knees, calling down blessings on the unknown thief who had a change of heart, praying that he might live to own a hundred such saddles.&quot; 

== Rise to power ==
=== Return to western Iran ===
Nader Shah was later murdered in 1747 at the hands of his own men, which gave the Zands under Karim Khan the opportunity to return to their former lands in western Iran. In 1748/49, Karim Khan allied with the military leader Zakariya Khan, and clashed with the Bakhtiari chieftain Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari, whom they initially defeated, but was shortly suffered a loss and was forced to withdraw from the strategic town of Golpayegan, which Ali Mardan seized.

In the spring of 1750, Ali Mardan attempted to capture the former Safavid capital of Isfahan, but was defeated at Murcheh Khvort, a town near the city. He then started to dispatch messengers at Golpayegan to his regional opponents, which included Karim Khan and Zakariya Khan, who accepted his offer of terms, and combined their forces with the latter, which made the number of their men strengthen to 20,000.
In May 1750, they stormed the gates of Isfahan—its governor Abu&#x27;l-Fath Khan Bakhtiari and other prominent residents assembled to protect the fortress of the city, but agreed to surrender and collaborate with them after Ali Mardan&#x27;s reasonable proposals. Abu&#x27;l-Fath, together with Ali Mardan and Karim Khan, formed an alliance in western Iran under the cover of restoring the Safavid dynasty, appointing a 17-year-old Safavid prince, Abu Turab, as a puppet ruler—on 29 June, Abu Turab was declared shah, and assumed the dynastic name of Ismail III.

Ali Mardan then took the title of &quot;Vakil-e daulat&quot; (&quot;deputy of the state&quot;) as the head of the administration, while Abu&#x27;l-Fath maintained his post as governor of Isfahan, and Karim Khan was appointed commander (&quot;sardar&quot;) of the army, and was given the task of conquering the rest of Iran. However, a few months later, while Karim Khan was on an expedition in Kurdistan, Ali Mardan began breaking the terms which they had promised the inhabitants of Isfahan—he greatly increased his shakedown on the city, which New Julfa suffered the most from. He then further broke the terms he had made with the two chieftains, by having Abu&#x27;l-Fath deposed and killed. He then appointed his uncle as the new governor of the city, and without conference, marched towards Shiraz and began pillaging the province of Fars. After having plundered Kazerun, Ali Mardan left for Isfahan, but was ambushed at the dangerous passage of Kutal-e Dokhtar by regional guerrillas under Muzari Ali Khishti, who was the chieftain of the neighbouring Khisht village. They managed to seize the plunder of Ali Mardan and kill 300 of his men, which forced the latter to withdraw to a more difficult passage to reach Isfahan. By winter, the forces of Ali Mardan had decreased even more due to abandonment from some of his men.

===War with Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari over supremacy in western Iran===

The situation worsened further for Ali Mardan, when Karim Khan returned to Isfahan in January 1751 and restored order in the city. A battle shortly occurred between them in Chaharmahal—during the battle, Ismail III and Zakariya Khan (who was now his &quot;vizier&quot;), together with several prominent officers, deserted Ali Mardan and joined Karim Khan, who eventually emerged victorious, forcing Ali Mardan and the remains of his men, together with the governor of Luristan, Ismail Khan Feyli, to retreat to Khuzestan. There Ali Mardan made an alliance with Shaykh Sa&#x27;d, the governor of Khuzestan, who reinforced him with soldiers. In the late spring of 1752, Ali Mardan, together with Ismail Khan Feyli, marched to Kermanshah. The forces of Karim Khan shortly attacked their encampment, but were repelled. Ali Mardan then went further into domains of the Zands, which resulted in a battle with Karim Khan near Nahavand. Ali Mardan, however, was once again defeated, and forced to withdraw into the mountains, where he went to the Ottoman city of Baghdad.

A year later, in early 1753, Ali Mardan together with a former Afsharid diplomat and a son of the former Safavid shah Tahmasp II (r. 1729–1732) had returned to Iran and began assembling an army in Luristan, and received the support of the Pashtun military leader Azad Khan Afghan. Some months later, they marched into the domains of Karim Khan, but Tahmasp II&#x27;s son, who had been announced as Sultan Husayn II, began revealing himself as an unfit candidate as Safavid shah—this hindered their march, and resulted in the desertion of many of their men.

Ali Mardan&#x27;s men in Kirmanshah, after two years of besiegement by the Zand forces, surrendered and were spared by Karim Khan, who shortly clashed with Ali Mardan once again, defeating the latter and capturing Mustafa Khan. Ali Mardan managed to flee with Sultan Husayn II, but not after long had him blinded and sent to Iraq, due to being more heavy weight than of use to him.

== Reign ==
=== War with the Dutch East India Company ===

The Zands and the Dutch often clashed for influence of the Kharg Island.

Some time later, Karim Khan, Ali Mardan Khan and another Bakhtiari chieftain named Abulfath Khan Bakhtiari reached an agreement to divide the country among themselves and give the throne to the Safavid prince Ismail III. However, the cooperation ended after Ali Mardan Khan invaded Isfahan and killed Abulfath Khan. Subsequently, Karim Khan killed Ali Mardan Khan and gained control over all of Iran except Khorasan, which was ruled by Shahrukh, the grandson of Nader Shah. Nevertheless, Karim Khan did not adopt the title of &quot;Shah&quot; for himself, preferring the title, &quot;Vakil e-Ra&#x27;aayaa&quot; (Representative of the People).

While Karim was ruler, Persia recovered from the devastation of 40 years of war, providing the war ravaged country with a renewed sense of tranquility, security, peace, and prosperity. The years from 1765 to Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779 marked the zenith of Zand rule. During his reign, relations with Britain were restored, and he allowed the East India Company to have a trading post in southern Iran. He made Shiraz his capital and ordered the construction of several architectural projects there. Karim Khan later died on 1 March 1779, having been ill for six months, most likely due to tuberculosis. He was buried three days later in the &quot;Nazar Garden&quot;, now known as the Pars Museum.

Following Karim Khan&#x27;s death, civil war broke out once more, and none of his descendants were able to rule the country as effectively as he had. The last of these descendants, Lotf Ali Khan, was killed by Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who became the sole ruler of Iran.

=== War with the Ottoman Empire (1775–1776) ===

In 1774, the Mamluk governor of the Ottoman province of Iraq, Omar Pasha began meddling in the affairs of his vassal principality of Baban, which since the death of his predecessor Sulayman Abu Layla Pasha in 1762, had fallen more and more under the influence of the Zand governor of Ardalan, Khosrow Khan Bozorg. This made Omar Pasha dismiss the Baban ruler Muhammad Pasha, and appoint Abdolla Pasha as its new ruler. This, and Omar Pasha&#x27;s seizure of the remnants of Iranian pilgrims who had died during the plague that ravaged Iraq in 1773—and his exaction of payment from Iranian pilgrims to visit the holy Shia places of Najaf and Karbala, gave Karim Khan the &quot;casus belli&quot; to declare war against the Ottomans.

There were also other reasons for Karim Khan to declare war—Mashhad, where the holy Imam Reza shrine was situated, was not under Zand control, which thus meant that free entry to the sanctuaries of Iraq was of more significance to Karim Khan than it had been to the Safavid and Afsharid shahs. The Zand army was discontent, and sought to restore their reputation after Zaki Khans humiliating blunders on the Hormuz Island. Most importantly, Basra was a prominent trading port, which had surpassed the competing city of Bushehr in Fars in 1769, when the East India Company dropped the city for Basra.

The Zand forces under Ali-Morad Khan Zand and Nazar Ali Khan Zand shortly clashed with the Pasha&#x27;s forces in Kurdistan, where they kept them at bay, whilst Sadeq Khan, with an army of 30,000, besieged Basra in April 1775. The Arab tribe al-Muntafiq, which was allied with the governor of Basra, quickly withdrew without any effort to reject Sadeq Khan from passing through the Shatt al-Arab, whilst the Banu Ka&#x27;b and the Arabs of Bushehr supplied him with boats and supplies.

Suleiman Agha, who was the commander of the fort of Basra, resisted Sadeq Khan&#x27;s forces with resolve, which made the latter establish an encirclement, which would last over a year. Henry Moore, who belonged to the East India company, assaulted some of Sadeq Khan&#x27;s stockpile boats, tried to block the Shatt al-Arab, and then departed to Bombay. A few months later, in October, a group of ships from Oman gave supplies and military aid to Basra, which considerably lifted the morale of its forces. However, their combined attack the next day occurred to be wavering—the Omani ships eventually chose to withdraw back to Muscat during winter, in order to avoid further losses.

Reinforcements from Baghdad arrived shortly afterwards, which was repelled by the Khaza&#x27;il, a Shia Arab tribe which was allied with the Zand forces. In the spring of 1776, the narrow encirclement by Sadeq Khan had resulted in the defenders being on the fringe of famine—a considerable portion of the Basra forces had deserted Suleiman Agha, whilst the rumours of a possible uprising, made Suleiman Agha surrender on 16 April 1776.

Even though the able Ottoman Sultan Mustafa III (r. 1757–1774) had died and was succeeded by his incompetent brother Abdul Hamid I (r. 1774–1789), and the recent Ottoman defeat to the Russians, the Ottoman response to the Ottoman–Iranian war was unusually slow. In February 1775, before the announcement of the siege of Basra had approached Istanbul, and while the Zagros front was temporarily peaceful, the Ottoman ambassador, Vehbi Efendi, was sent to Shiraz. He reached Shiraz around the same time Sadeq Khan besieged Basra, &quot;but was not empowered to negotiate over this new crisis.&quot;

In 1778, Karim Khan had made a compromise with the Russians for a cooperative offensive into eastern Anatolia. However, the invasion never took place due to Karim Khan&#x27;s death on 1 March 1779, after having been ill for six months, most likely due to tuberculosis. He was buried three days later in the &quot;Nazar Garden&quot;, now known as the Pars Museum.

== Succession ==
Following Karim Khan&#x27;s death, civil war broke out—Zaki Khan, in an alliance with Ali-Morad Khan Zand, declared Karim Khan&#x27;s incapable and youngest son Mohammad Ali Khan Zand as the new Zand ruler, while Shaykh Ali Khan and Nazar Ali Khan, along with other notables, supported Karim Khan&#x27;s elder son, Abol-Fath Khan Zand. However, shortly afterwards, Zaki Khan baited Shaykh Ali Khan and Nazar Ali Khan out of the fortress of Shiraz, and slaughtered them.

== Relations with Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar ==

During his stay Agha Mohammad Khan was treated kindly and honorably by Karim Khan, who made him convince his kinsmen to lay down their arms, which they did. Karim Khan then settled them in Damghan. In 1763, Agha Mohammad Khan and Hosayn Qoli Khan were sent to the Zand capital, Shiraz, where their paternal aunt Khadijeh Begum, who was part of Karim Khan&#x27;s harem, lived. Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s half-brothers Morteza Qoli Khan and Mostafa Qoli Khan were granted permission to live in Astarabad, due to their mother being the sister of the governor of the city. His remaining brothers were sent to Qazvin, where they were treated honorably.

Agha Mohammad was looked upon more as a respected guest in Karim Khan&#x27;s court than a captive. Furthermore, Karim Khan also acknowledged Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s political knowledge and asked his advice on interests of the state. He called Agha Mohammad Khan his &quot;Piran-e Viseh&quot;, referring to an intelligent counselor of the legendary Iranian king Afrasiab. Two of Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s brothers who were at Qazvin were also sent to Shiraz during this period. In February 1769, Karim Khan appointed Hosayn Qoli Khan as the governor of Damghan. When Hosayn Qoli Khan reached Damghan, he immediately began a fierce conflict with the Develu and other tribes to avenge his father&#x27;s death. He was, however, killed ca. 1777 near Findarisk by some Turks from the Yamut tribe with whom he had clashed. On 1 March 1779, while Agha Mohammad Khan was hunting, he was informed by Khadijeh Begum that Karim Khan had died after six months of illness.

== Characteristics and legacy ==

Karim Khan is often praised for his generosity, modesty and fairness more than other Iranian rulers—he surpasses Khosrow I Anushirvan and Shah Abbas I the Great in terms of being a benevolent monarch with a sincere interest in his subjects, whereas these and other monarchs outperform him in terms of military fame and global reputation. A wealth of tales and anecdotes portray Karim Khan as a compassionate ruler, genuinely concerned with the welfare of his subjects.

Indeed, even in present-day Iran he is remembered by his compatriots as a respectable man who rose to become a ruler and continued his virtuous behaviour. He was not embarrassed of his modest descent, and never desired to attempt to pursue a more distinguished lineage than that of the leader of a formerly little-known tribe that roamed in the Zagros ranges of western Iran. Karim Khan had modest preferences in clothes and furniture, having the tall yellow cashmere Zand turban on the top of his head, whilst sitting on an inexpensive carpet rather than a throne. He had presents of jewels crushed into pieces and sold to keep the state treasury stable. He washed himself and changed clothes once a month, a wastefulness which even astonished his kinsmen.

During his reign, Karim Khan achieved in reviving an unexpected rate of considerable good fortune and harmony to a country that had suffered from impair and turmoil by his predecessors. Although his integrity is considerably enlarged due to the cruelty and authoritarianism of Nader Shah and Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, his unusual mixture of vitality and ambition with rationality and goodwill created, for a short extent of time in a notably fierce and anarchic century, a balanced and virtuous state.

As noted by &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&quot;, &quot;Karim Khan Zand holds an enduring reputation as the most humane Iranian ruler of the Islamic era&quot;. Following the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the names of the past rulers of Iran became taboo, but the citizens of Shiraz refused to rename the two main streets of Shiraz, one of which being the Karim Khan Zand Street (the other one being the Lotf Ali Khan Zand Street).

In the words of John Malcolm, &quot;The happy reign of this excellent prince, as contrasted with those who preceded and followed him, affords the historian of Persia that kind of mixed pleasure and repose, which a traveler enjoys on arriving in a beautiful and fertile valley during an arduous journey over barren and rugged wastes. It is pleasing to recount the actions of a chief who, though born of an inferior rank, obtained power without crime, and who exercised it with a moderation that, for the times in which he lived, was as singular as his humanity and justice.&quot;

== Government, policies, and society ==
===The bureaucracy===
The bureaucracy remained small during the reign of Karim Khan, due slightly to the ruler&#x27;s own desires and slightly to the earlier clutters and subsequent bureaucratic collapse that had occurred. He was backed by a &quot;vizier&quot; and a chief revenue officer (&quot;mustaufī&quot;), who, however, had minimal influence and authority, due to Karim Khan&#x27;s practice of rigidly handling the political affairs by himself.

=== Relations with the tribal clans of Iran ===

=== Provincial administration ===

During Karim Khan&#x27;s reign, provincial administration followed the same model of the Safavid one; &quot;beglerbegis&quot; were appointed to govern provinces. A city was under the rule of a &quot;kalantar&quot; and &quot;darugha&quot;, while its quarters was under the rule of the &quot;kadkhuda&quot;. Governorship of provinces went for the most part to tribal chieftains from Fars and its surroundings—a minister who was experienced in the administration and the income of tax regularly escorted the governor. Karim Khan also created two new posts regarding the tribes: He appointed an &quot;ilkhani&quot; as the leader of all the Lur tribes and an &quot;ilbegi&quot; as the leader of all the Qashqai tribes that roamed Fars.

=== Military ===
During the dynastic wars and the conflict with the Qajars that took place after the death of Karim Khan, the Zand army disintegrated into several segments, which joined the several Zand princes who fought for the throne, but ultimately the majority of the segments changed their allegiance to the Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar.

===Construction===

Karim Khan rebuilt much of Shiraz, and had many new buildings erected, such as his famous castle, and several gardens and mosques. Furthermore, he also had a new city wall, several baths, a caravanserai, and a bazaar built. Many of these, have, however, been destroyed, either during Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s capture of the city in 1792, or during the 20th-century metropolitan restructuring.

Karim Khan had the burial places of the prominent Muzaffarid ruler Shah Shoja (r. 1358–1384), and the celebrated Persian poets Hafez and Saadi renovated. Many of the pastoral Lur and Lak families were given homes in Shiraz, which eventually resulted in the city having a larger population (ca. 40,000-50,000) than Isfahan, which drew the attention of many poets, craftsmens, and even foreign traders from Europe and India, who were warmly received.

===Religious policies===
Unlike the Safavids, Karim Khan did not seek the approval of the &quot;ulama&quot; (clergy), who were &quot;formerly the bulwarks of the shah&#x27;s authority as viceroy of God and the Imams&quot;.

== In art ==
Karim Khan is the main character of a melodrama composed by the Italian musician Nicolò Gabrielli di Quercita. The work, entitled &quot;L&#x27;assedio di Sciraz&quot; (The siege of Shiraz) was first performed at La Scala theatre in Milan during Carnival 1840.

<doc id="1004470" wikidata="Q202011" url="?curid=1004470" title="Dhanvantari">
<text>Dhanvantari () is the physician of the devas in Hinduism. He is regarded as an avatar of Vishnu. He is mentioned in the Puranas as the god of Ayurveda.

During his incarnation on earth, he reigned as the King of Kashi, today locally referred to as Varanasi. Dhanvantari is also identified as the great-grandfather of Divodasa, a mythological King of Kashi in the Vishnu Purana.

== Iconography ==

According to the ancient Sanskrit work &quot;Vishnudharamottara&quot;, Dhanvantari is a handsome individual and is to usually be depicted with four hands, with one or two of them carrying a bowl of amrita, the elixir of immortality. Dhanvantari is depicted in a stark resemblance to Vishnu, with four hands, holding the shankha, chakra, jalauka (leech), and a pot containing amrita. He is often shown with a leech in his hand rather than the scriptures, symbolism for the historical practice of bloodletting.

Some texts describe him as holding a conch, amrita, medicinal herbs, and a book of Ayurveda.

== Legend ==

=== Origin ===
&quot;The Bala Kanda&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; state that Dhanvantari emerged from the Ocean of Milk and appeared with the pot of amrita (elixir of immortality) during the &quot;Samudra Manthana,&quot; whilst the ocean was being churned by the devas and the asuras, using the Mandara mountain and the serpent Vasuki. The pot of amrita was snatched by the asuras, and after this event, Vishnu&#x27;s avatar, Mohini, appears and takes the nectar back from the asuras. It is also believed that Dhanvantari promulgated the practice of Ayurveda. Of special mention here is the treatise of &quot;Dhanvantari-Nighantu&quot;, which completely elucidates Dhanvantari&#x27;s medicinal plants.

The Brahmanda Purana describes the origin of the physician deity:
=== Incarnation ===
During the second Dvapara Yuga, the King of Kashi, Dirghatapas, propitiated the physician deity for the birth of a son. The deity agreed to incarnate himself as the desired child as a boon. Dhanavantri proved to be a great king, and is described as the &quot;dispeller of all ailments&quot;. He is described to have been exempt from infirmities and recognised as a &quot;master of universal knowledge&quot;. The sage Bharadvaja educated him regarding the therapeutic practice of Ayurveda, and further caused him to study medicine. The king created a classification of his knowledge of medicine into eight fields and disseminated it to a number of diverse disciples.

=== Dhanvantari and Manasa ===
According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Dhanvantari, accompanied by his disciples, once journeyed to Kailasha. On the way, a naga named Takshaka emitted a venom-spitting hiss. A disciple plucked the diamond upon the head of Takshaka and hurled it towards the earth. Upon learning these events, the powerful serpent-king Vasuki amassed thousands of serpents under the leadership of Drona, Pundarika, and Dhananjaya against the entourage. The poisonous emissions of all these serpents united to make the disciples of Dhanvantari faint. Immediately, Dhanvantari concocted a medicine made from &quot;vanaspati&quot;, allowing his followers to recover and causing the snakes to faint in turn. When Vasuki understood what had transpired, he sent a Shaiva serpent goddess, Manasa, to face Dhanvantari. Manasa sent the disciples of Dhanvantari into a swoon, but since the deity was proficient in the art of &quot;Vishvavidya&quot;, he soon restored his disciples to consciousness. When Manasa deemed it impossible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples, she held the trishula given to her by Shiva and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this, Shiva and Brahma appeared before them and restored the peace, sending them all on their way.

== Temples ==

<text>Renshaw cells are inhibitory interneurons found in the gray matter of the spinal cord, and are associated in two ways with an alpha motor neuron. 
* They receive an excitatory collateral from the alpha neuron&#x27;s axon as they emerge from the motor root, and are thus &quot;kept informed&quot; of how vigorously that neuron is firing.
* They send an inhibitory axon to synapse with the cell body of the initial alpha neuron and/or an alpha motor neuron of the same motor pool.

In this way, the Renshaw cell action represents a negative feedback mechanism. A Renshaw cell may be supplied by more than one alpha motor neuron collateral and it may synapse on multiple motor neurons.

==Function==

Although during embryonic development the Renshaw cells lack synapses from the dorsal root, prenatal and postnatal stages show the development of dorsal root originating synapses, which are functional and stimulate action potentials. But these decrease during development while acetylcholine motor axons begin to synapse and proliferate with Renshaw cells, ultimately being primarily stimulated by the motor neurons.

The Renshaw cells are ultimately excited by multiple antidromic motor neuron axons, where the majority of axons originate from synergist motor neurons, and in turn the Renshaw cell synapses with multiple neurons, eliciting IPSP in alpha motor, 1a inhibitory interneurons and gamma motor neurons. The antidromic collateral circuit back to the triggering motor neuron is known as “recurrent inhibition”. This homonymous inhibition is not universal. Whereas most initial experiments have been done on cats, it has been found that in man that proximal muscles of the hand and foot do not have homonymous inhibition. Heteronymous inhibition has been found to be dominant in the leg compared to the arm, where antagonist muscles work simultaneously. (Renshaw cells are activated by gamma motor neurons, but to a lesser extent).
The Renshaw cells not only synapse with homonymous and heteronymous nerves, but also with the Ia interneurones, which are stimulated by the Ia afferents from the same muscle group activated by the motor neurons, which have an inhibitory effect on the antagonist muscle group. This “recurrent facilitation” causes reduced inhibition of the reciprocal inhibition of the Ia interneuron of the antagonist group, which may in turn also be inhibited by signals from the corticospinal tract. It has been shown that: 
* Recurrent inhibition is depressed during strong voluntary contractions (presumably due to inhibition of the Reshaw cell by descending input).
* Renshaw cells are more inhibited at the same level during a dynamic contraction compared with sustained contraction.
* Renshaw cells are facilitated during weak voluntary contractions.
* Renshaw cells are facilitated during co-activation of antagonists.

The Renshaw cells may also be inhibited by both proprioceptive dorsal root afferents], antidromic ventral axons as well as “descending” inhibition. The hyperpolarization of Renshaw cells by afferent and descending neurons have been shown to be caused by the release of glycine, but GABA may also hyperpolarize the Renshaw cell - for a prolonged time relative to glycine. It has also been shown that glycine is the inhibitory transmitter released by the Renshaw cells.

In essence the Renshaw cells regulate the firing of the alpha motor neuron leaving the ventral horn. Conceptually they remove “noise” by dampening the firing frequency of over-excited neurons with a negative feedback loop, which prevents weakly excited alpha motor neurons from firing. Descending spinal cord nerves in turn regulate the Renshaw cells.

The rate of discharge of the Renshaw cell is broadly proportional to the rate of discharge of the associated motor neuron(s), and the rate of discharge of the motor neuron(s) is broadly inversely proportional to the rate of discharge of the Renshaw cell(s). Renshaw cells thus act as &quot;limiters,&quot; or &quot;governors,&quot; on the alpha motor neuron system, thus helping to prevent muscular damage from tetanus.

Renshaw cells utilize the neurotransmitter glycine as an inhibitory substance that synapses on the alpha motor neurons.

==Clinical significance==

Renshaw cells are also the target of the toxin of &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;, a Gram positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that lives in the soil, and causes tetanus. When wounds are contaminated with &quot;C. tetani&quot;, the toxin travels to the spinal cord where it inhibits the release of glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, from Renshaw cells. As a result, alpha motor neurons become hyperactive, and muscles constantly contract.

Strychnine poison also specifically acts on these cell&#x27;s ability to control alpha motor neuron firing by binding to the glycine receptors on the alpha motor neuron and thus muscles continually contract and may prove fatal if the diaphragm is involved.

==History==

The concept of the Renshaw cells was postulated by Birdsey Renshaw (1911–1948), when it was discovered that with antidromic signals from a motor neuron running collaterally back via the ventral root into the spinal cord, there were interneurons firing with a high frequency, resulting in inhibition. Later work by Eccles &quot;et al.&quot;, provided evidence that these interneurons, which they called “Renshaw Cells,” are stimulated by acetylcholine from motor neurons (nicotinic receptor). Previous work by Renshaw and Lloyd had shown that this antidromic inhibition resembled direct inhibition from spinal nerves but resulted in relatively longer inhibition of 40-50 ms (compared to 15 ms). The antidromic stimulation of the nerve fiber also resulted in action potentials in the cell bodies of the motor neurons along with hyperpolarization of other groups of motor neurons. In the event where the initial stimulation of the motor neuron originated in a spinal tract the Renshaw cell spike occurred during the declining phase of the initial motor neuron soma spike giving an indication of the source and sequence of stimulation of the Renshaw cell.

<doc id="1004474" wikidata="Q992893" url="?curid=1004474" title="Brunner's glands">
<text>Brunner&#x27;s glands (or duodenal glands) are compound tubuloalveolar submucosal glands found in that portion of the duodenum proximal to the hepatopancreatic sphincter (i.e sphincter of Oddi).

For decades, it was believed that the main function of the glands is to secrete alkaline (bicarbonate-containing) mucus in order to:
* protect the duodenum from the acidic content of chyme (which enters the duodenum from the stomach),
* provide an alkaline environment which promotes the activity of intestinal enzymes,
* lubricate the intestinal walls.

However, more recent studies have demonstrated that Brunner’s glands actually act as major modulators of the gut microbiome and systemic immunity.

They are the distinguishing feature of the duodenum, and are named for the Swiss physician who first described them, Johann Conrad Brunner.

==Structure==
Duodenal glands are situated within the mucosa and submucosa of the duodenum. They are most abundant near the pylorus, growing shorter and more sparse distally towards the terminal portion of the duodenum.

The duodenum can be distinguished from the jejunum and ileum by the presence of Brunner&#x27;s glands in the submucosa.

== Histology ==
Their excretory cannals are tortuous, opening at the bases of the villi.

Two forms of duodenal glands are distinguished: the external group (which are more voluminous and extend into the duodenal submucosa), and the internal group (which are smaller and are situated within the duodenal mucosa).

== Function ==
They also secrete epidermal growth factor, which inhibits parietal and chief cells of the stomach from secreting acid and their digestive enzymes. This is another form of protection for the duodenum.

The Brunner glands, which empty into the intestinal glands, secrete an alkaline fluid composed of mucin, which exerts a physiologic anti-acid function by coating the duodenal epithelium, therefore protecting it from the acid chyme of the stomach. Furthermore, in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum, these glands secrete pepsinogen and urogastrone, which inhibit gastric acid secretion.

More recent studies have demonstrated that Brunner’s glands are major modulators of the gut microbiome and systemic immunity. Studies conducted by Ivan De Araujo’s laboratory revealed that Brunner’s gland secretions promote the proliferation of probiotics and protect the host against foreign pathogens.

==Clinical significance==
Hyperplasia of Brunner glands with a lesion greater than 1 cm was initially described as a Brunner gland adenoma. Several features of these lesions favor their designation as hamartomas, including the lack of encapsulation; the mixture of acini, smooth muscles, adipose tissue, Paneth cells, and mucosal glands; and the lack of any cell atypia. These hamartomas are rare, with approximately 150 cases described in the literature. It is estimated that they represent approximately 5–10% of benign duodenal tumors. They are variable in size, typically 1–3 cm, with only a few reported cases of lesions larger than 5 cm.

Most patients with Brunner gland hamartomas are asymptomatic or have nonspecific complaints such as nausea, bloating, or vague abdominal pain.

Most reports in the literature describe local surgical resection of Brunner gland hamartoma via duodenotomy. Increasingly, successful endoscopic resection has been reported and is primarily used for pedunculated Brunner gland hamartomas. The endoscopic approach in selective cases appears to be safe, less invasive, and less costly.

Consistent with the more recent idea that Brunner’s glands influence systemic immunity via the microbiome, patients who had the duodenal bulb removed (where the glands are mostly located) showed greater alterations in immune factors compared to patients having  more distal parts of the duodenum removed.

<doc id="1004477" wikidata="Q7378175" url="?curid=1004477" title="Rugby Football League Championship Second Division">
<text>The Rugby Football League Championship Second Division was founded in 1902 and was the second tier of professional rugby league in the UK until 2003.

During the 1990s a third division was established and there is automatic promotion between the second and third division.

==History==
The Second Division was formed in 1902 by splitting the RFL Championship into two divisions of 18. After three seasons the Second Division was abolished and not resurrected until 1962. Two seasons later in 1964 the Second Division was scrapped for the second time.

The division was resurrected again in 1973 and has been played every season since. During the 1991–92 season, a third division was established and, for the first time, two teams were relegated. There was no regular relegation from the Second Division until 2003.

In 1995, in anticipation for the Super League starting in 1996, six teams were relegated from the RFL Championship, five were relegated to the Second Division and one was relegated to form the Third Division. Controversy was caused as London Broncos, who finished 4th in the Second Division, were elected to the Championship ahead of Keighley, Batley and Huddersfield.

In 2003, the divisions under Super League were reorganised into the National Leagues with Second and Third Divisions becoming National League One and National League Two.

<text>In human anatomy, the artery of Adamkiewicz (also arteria radicularis magna) is the largest anterior segmental medullary artery and the dominant segmental feeding vessel to the thoracic cord, supplying the anterior aspect of the cord (from T8 to the conus medullaris) via the anterior spinal artery. It is a radiculomedullary artery arising from the spinal dorsal branch of the segmental artery (posterior intercostal, subcostal, or lumbar artery), which in turn arises from the descending aorta. It typically arises from a 9th to 11th left posterior intercostal artery, enters through the L2-L3 intervertebral foramen to join the anterior spinal artery and supply much of the inferior half of the spinal cord. The artery is named after pathologist Albert Wojciech Adamkiewicz. 

==Nomenclature==

The artery is generally eponymic, but it has several other names, including:

* great radicular artery of Adamkiewicz
* major anterior segmental medullary artery
* artery of the lumbar enlargement
* great anterior radiculomedullary artery
* great anterior segmental medullary artery
* great ventral radicular artery

==Anatomy==
The artery has a characteristic &quot;hairpin&quot; turn on the cord surface as it first courses superiorly, then turns inferiorly. In 75% of people, it originates on the left side of the aorta between the T8 and L1 vertebral segments. In addition to being able to be either right or left-sided, the vessel can arise from a lumbar artery instead of from the aorta.

In an extensive literature review, recognition of the AKA using CT and/or MR was achieved in 466 of 555 cases (83.96%) and in 384 (83.3%) cases the AKA originated from a left intercostal artery.

==Clinical significance==
The artery provides blood supply to the front two-thirds of the lumbar and sacral cord. When damaged or obstructed, it can result in a syndrome of spinal cord ischemia, similar to anterior spinal artery syndrome, with loss of urinary and fecal continence and impaired motor function of the legs; sensory function is often preserved to a degree.

It is important to identify the location of the artery when surgically treating an aortic aneurysm to prevent damage which would result in a loss of blood supply to the spinal cord. 

In bronchial artery embolization for treatment of massive lung bleeding, one of the most serious complications is to lose blood flow to the spinal cord caused by accidental closure of the artery of Adamkiewicz. Its location can be identified with computed tomographic angiography.

==History==
It is named for Albert Wojciech Adamkiewicz.

<doc id="1004484" wikidata="Q513486" url="?curid=1004484" title="Kupffer cell">
<text>Kupffer cells, also known as stellate macrophages and Kupffer–Browicz cells, are specialized cells localized in the liver within the lumen of the liver sinusoids and are adhesive to their endothelial cells which make up the blood vessel walls. Kupffer cells comprise the largest population of tissue-resident macrophages in the body. Gut bacteria, bacterial endotoxins, and microbial debris transported to the liver from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein will first come in contact with Kupffer cells, the first immune cells in the liver. It is because of this that any change to Kupffer cell functions can be connected to various liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, intrahepatic cholestasis, steatohepatitis, activation or rejection of the liver during liver transplantation and liver fibrosis. They form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

== Location and structure ==
Kupffer cells can be found attached to sinusoidal endothelial cells in both the centrilobular and periportal regions of the hepatic lobules. Kupffer cell function and structures are specialized depending on their location. Periportal Kupffer cells tend to be larger and have more lysosomal enzyme and phagocytic activity, whereas centrilobular Kupffer cells create more superoxide radical. 

Kupffer cells are amoeboid in character, with surface features including microvilli, pseudopodia and lamellipodia, which project in every direction. The microvilli and pseudopodia play a role in the endocytosis of particles. 

The nucleus is indented and ovoid, and can be lobulated.

Notable cytoplasmic elements include ribosomes, Golgi complexes, centrioles, microtubules and microfilaments. Kupffer cells also contain rough endoplasmic reticulum, a nuclear envelope, and annulate lamellae, all of which demonstrate peroxidase activity. 

Importantly, Kupffer cells express the SR-AI/II scavenger receptor. This receptor is involved in recognising and binding the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid. (Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial endotoxin which is found in the cell wall gram-negative bacteria, whereas lipoteichoic acid is present in gram-positive bacteria.) Because of this detection system, Kupffer cells play a critical role in initiating and mediating immune responses to bacterial infection of the liver.

==Development==
Development of an initial population of Kupffer cells begins in the embryonic yolk sac where precursor cells differentiate into fetal macrophages. Once they enter the blood stream, they migrate to the fetal liver where they stay. There they complete their differentiation into Kupffer cells. Under normal conditions, these Kupffer cell populations are long-lived and self-renewing.

However, if resident Kupffer cell populations are depleted, monocytes derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and transported through blood circulation to the liver can also fully differentiate into true Kupffer cells. Unlike other tissue macrophages, which must be continually renewed by circulating monocytes, these monocyte-derived Kupffer cells are capable of self-renewal once a population is established.

Development of mature Kupffer cells is regulated by numerous growth factors, with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) playing a key role. Cytokines involved in type 2 inflammation, such as IL-4, may also stimulate Kupffer cell proliferation. A time frame of 14 to 21 days for complete replenishment of Kupffer cell populations has been demonstrated in animal studies. Despite high monocyte influx and maturation rates, hepatic Kupffer cell populations are tightly maintained. Evidently, there is a high rate of turnover, with the average lifespan of a Kupffer cell estimated at 3.8 days. However, the ultimate fate of Kupffer cells &quot; in vivo &quot; is not yet fully understood.

== Function ==
The primary function of the Kupffer cell is to remove foreign debris and particles that have come from the hepatic portal system when passing through the liver. It is possible for the Kupffer cells to take in large particles by phagocytosis and smaller particles via pinocytosis. Kupffer cells are integral in the innate responses of the immune system. They are important for host defense and play a role in the metabolism of many different compounds including, lipids, protein complexes and small particles. They are also useful in removing apoptotic cells from circulation. 

The amount of Kupffer cells in the liver is held constant. Kupffer cells have a proliferative capacity, allowing for cell populations to replenish themselves: this is in complete contrast to monocyte-derived macrophages that have no proliferative potential. Old or defective cells are removed through apoptosis, as well as through being phagocytized by neighbouring Kupffer cells.

Kupffer cells are heterogeneous in their function, dependent on their location in the liver lobules. Cells in the periportal zone are directly exposed to bloodflow, and express greater lysosomal activity to more efficiently process incoming foreign substances. In contrast, cells in the centrilobular zone experience less perfusion, and are equipped with greater stores of superoxide to combat deeply-penetrating injuries and infections. 

In response to infection or irritation, Kupffer cells can produce inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, oxygen radicals, and proteases. Excessive production of these mediators is linked to the development of liver injury.

Apart from clearing bacteria, Kupffer cells are also responsible for recycling hemoglobin by destroying senescent red blood cells through phagocytic action. The globin chains are re-used, while the iron-containing portion, heme, is further broken down into iron, which is re-used, and bilirubin, which is conjugated to glucuronic acid within hepatocytes and secreted into the bile.

Helmy et al. identified a receptor present in Kupffer cells, the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Mice without CRIg could not clear complement system-coated pathogens. CRIg is conserved in mice and humans and is a critical component of the innate immune system.

==Clinical significance==
Kupffer cells are incredibly plastic cells that have the capability to polarize specific activation states and can perform different functions in different microenvironments. M1 (classical activation) and M2 (alternative activation) designate the two extremes of macrophage polarization. M1-polarized Kupffer cells produce a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha. On the other hand, M2-polarized Kupffer cells produce a large quantity of anti-inflammatory mediators, for example, IL-10.

Kupffer cells play a role in the pathogenesis of a damaged liver in response to sepsis. The macrophages in the liver activate and release both IL-1 and TNF-alpha. In turn, this activates leukocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells to express ICAM-1. This results in tissue damage to the endothelium because of proteases, oxygen radicals, prostanoids and other substances from leukocytes.

Kupffer cell activation contributes to pathogenesis of both chronic and acute alcoholic liver disease in response to ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics. Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two-hit system. While the first hit is direct, mediated by the direct toxicity of ethanol and its metabolic byproducts, the second hit is indirect, mediated by increased uptake of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) from the intestine.

Ethanol increases permeability of the intestinal epithelium, resulting in endotoxin produced by the intestinal flora leaking from the intestinal lumen into the liver via the portal vein. The presence of endotoxin induces a strong M1 polarization of Kupffer cells. A large amount of reactive oxygen species, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced by the activated Kupffer cells which lead to liver injury.

The cascade begins with endotoxin-mediated activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize endotoxin. This in turn activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), with concurrent production of superoxides. 

Cytokines and superoxides go on to cause inflammation and oxidizing damage respectively, while TNFα triggers the stellate cells in the liver to initiate collagen synthesis. These processes result in fibrosis, or scarring of the liver. Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, a loss of function of the liver due to extensive scarring.

==History==
The cells were first observed by Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876. The scientist called them &quot;Sternzellen&quot; (star cells or hepatic stellate cell) but thought, inaccurately, that they were an integral part of the endothelium of the liver blood vessels and that they originated from it. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophages.

<doc id="1004486" wikidata="Q1152227" url="?curid=1004486" title="Pharmacogenomics">
<text>Pharmacogenomics, often abbreviated &quot;PGx,&quot; is the study of the role of the genome in drug response. Its name (&quot;&quot; + &quot;genomics&quot;) reflects its combining of pharmacology and genomics. Pharmacogenomics analyzes how the genetic makeup of a patient affects their response to drugs. It deals with the influence of acquired and inherited genetic variation on drug response, by correlating DNA mutations (including point mutations, copy number variations, and structural variations) with pharmacokinetic (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), pharmacodynamic (effects mediated through a drug&#x27;s biological targets), and/or immunogenic endpoints.

Pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with regard to the patients&#x27; genotype, to achieve maximum efficiency with minimal adverse effects. It is hoped that by using pharmacogenomics, pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the &quot;one-dose-fits-all&quot; approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate trial-and-error in prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient&#x27;s genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the effectiveness of the patient&#x27;s current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual&#x27;s unique genetic makeup.

Whether used to explain a patient&#x27;s response (or lack of it) to a treatment, or to act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes and greater efficacy, and reduce drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who do not respond to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping, or exome or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).

== Pharmacogenetics vs. pharmacogenomics ==
The term &quot;pharmacogenomics&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;pharmacogenetics&quot;. Although both terms relate to drug response based on genetic influences, there are differences between the two. Pharmacogenetics is limited to monogenic phenotypes (i.e., single gene-drug interactions). Pharmacogenomics refers to polygenic drug response phenotypes and encompasses transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

== Mechanisms of pharmacogenetic interactions ==

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Pharmacokinetics involves the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of pharmaceutics. These processes are often facilitated by enzymes such as drug transporters or drug metabolizing enzymes (discussed in-depth below). Variation in DNA loci responsible for producing these enzymes can alter their expression or activity so that their functional status changes. An increase, decrease, or loss of function for transporters or metabolizing enzymes can ultimately alter the amount of medication in the body and at the site of action. This may result in deviation from the medication&#x27;s therapeutic window and result in either toxicity or loss of effectiveness.

==== Drug-metabolizing enzymes ====
The majority of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variation occurs in genes that code for drug-metabolizing enzymes, including those involved in both phase I and phase II metabolism. The cytochrome P450 enzyme family is responsible for metabolism of 70-80% of all medications used clinically. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are major CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism and are all known to be highly polymorphic. Additional drug-metabolizing enzymes that have been implicated in pharmacogenetic interactions include UGT1A1 (a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), DPYD, and TPMT.

==== Drug transporters ====
Many medications rely on transporters to cross cellular membranes in order to move between body fluid compartments such as the blood, gut lumen, bile, urine, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid. The major transporters include the solute carrier, ATP-binding cassette, and organic anion transporters. Transporters that have been shown to influence response to medications include OATP1B1 (&quot;SLCO1B1&quot;) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (&quot;ABCG2).&quot;

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Pharmacodynamics refers to the impact a medication has on the body, or its mechanism of action.

==== Drug targets ====
Drug targets are the specific sites where a medication carries out its pharmacological activity. The interaction between the drug and this site results in a modification of the target that may include inhibition or potentiation. Most of the pharmacogenetic interactions that involve drug targets are within the field of oncology and include targeted therapeutics designed to address somatic mutations (see also Cancer Pharmacogenomics). For example, EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib (Iressa) or erlotinib (Tarceva) are only indicated in patients carrying specific mutations to &quot;EGFR&quot;.

Germline mutations in drug targets can also influence response to medications, though this is an emerging subfield within pharmacogenomics. One well-established gene-drug interaction involving a germline mutation to a drug target is warfarin (Coumadin) and &quot;VKORC1&quot;, which codes for vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Warfarin binds to and inhibits VKOR, which is an important enzyme in the vitamin K cycle. Inhibition of VKOR prevents reduction of vitamin K, which is a cofactor required in the formation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X, and inhibitors protein C and S.

==== Off-target sites ====
Medications can have off-target effects (typically unfavorable) that arise from an interaction between the medication and/or its metabolites and a site other than the intended target. Genetic variation in the off-target sites can influence this interaction. The main example of this type of pharmacogenomic interaction is glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD). G6PD is the enzyme involved in the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway which generates NADPH (from NADP). NADPH is required for the production of reduced glutathione in erythrocytes and it is essential for the function of catalase. Glutathione and catalase protect cells from oxidative stress that would otherwise result in cell lysis. Certain variants in &quot;G6PD&quot; result in G6PD deficiency, in which cells are more susceptible to oxidative stress. When medications that have a significant oxidative effect are administered to individuals who are G6PD deficient, they are at an increased risk of erythrocyte lysis that presents as hemolytic anemia.

=== Immunologic ===
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, also referred to as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is a complex of genes important for the adaptive immune system. Mutations in the HLA complex have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions in response to certain medications.

=== Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) ===

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) is &quot;an international consortium of individual volunteers and a small dedicated staff who are interested in facilitating use of pharmacogenetic tests for patient care. CPIC’s goal is to address barriers to clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic tests by creating, curating, and posting freely available, peer-reviewed, evidence-based, updatable, and detailed gene/drug clinical practice guidelines. CPIC guidelines follow standardized formats, include systematic grading of evidence and clinical recommendations, use standardized terminology, are peer-reviewed, and are published in a journal (in partnership with Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics) with simultaneous posting to cpicpgx.org, where they are regularly updated.&quot;

The CPIC guidelines are &quot;designed to help clinicians understand HOW available genetic test results should be used to optimize drug therapy, rather than WHETHER tests should be ordered. A key assumption underlying the CPIC guidelines is that clinical high-throughput and pre-emptive (pre-prescription) genotyping will become more widespread, and that clinicians will be faced with having patients’ genotypes available even if they have not explicitly ordered a test with a specific drug in mind. CPIC&#x27;s guidelines, processes and projects have been endorsed by several professional societies.&quot;

=== U.S. Food and Drug Administration ===

==== Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations ====
In February 2020 the FDA published the Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations. For the gene-drug pairs included in the table, &quot;the FDA has evaluated and believes there is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that subgroups of patients with certain genetic variants, or genetic variant-inferred phenotypes (such as affected subgroup in the table below), are likely to have altered drug metabolism, and in certain cases, differential therapeutic effects, including differences in risks of adverse events.&quot;

&quot;The information in this Table is intended primarily for prescribers, and patients should not adjust their medications without consulting their prescriber. This version of the table is limited to pharmacogenetic associations that are related to drug metabolizing enzyme gene variants, drug transporter gene variants, and gene variants that have been related to a predisposition for certain adverse events. The FDA recognizes that various other pharmacogenetic associations exist that are not listed here, and this table will be updated periodically with additional pharmacogenetic associations supported by sufficient scientific evidence.&quot;

==== Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling ====
The FDA Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling lists FDA-approved drugs with pharmacogenomic information found in the drug labeling. &quot;Biomarkers in the table include but are not limited to germline or somatic gene variants (polymorphisms, mutations), functional deficiencies with a genetic etiology, gene expression differences, and chromosomal abnormalities; selected protein biomarkers that are used to select treatments for patients are also included.&quot;

=== PharmGKB ===
The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) is an &quot;NIH-funded resource that provides information about how human genetic variation affects response to medications. PharmGKB collects, curates and disseminates knowledge about clinically actionable gene-drug associations and genotype-phenotype relationships.&quot;

== Commercial Pharmacogenetic Testing Laboratories ==
There are many commercial laboratories around the world who offer pharmacogenomic testing as a laboratory developed test (LDTs). The tests offered can vary significantly from one lab to another, including genes and alleles tested for, phenotype assignment, and any clinical annotations provided. With the exception of a few direct-to-consumer tests, all pharmacogenetic testing requires an order from an authorized healthcare professional. In order for the results to be used in a clinical setting in the United States, the laboratory performing the test must be CLIA-certified. Other regulations may vary by country and state.
=== Direct-to-Consumer Pharmacogenetic Testing ===
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmacogenetic tests allow consumers to obtain pharmacogenetic testing without an order from a prescriber. DTC pharmacogenetic tests are generally reviewed by the FDA to determine the validity of test claims. The FDA maintains a list of DTC genetic tests that have been approved.

== Common Pharmacogenomic-Specific Nomenclature ==

=== Genotype ===
There are multiple ways to represent a pharmacogenomic genotype. A commonly used nomenclature system is to report haplotypes using a star (*) allele (e.g., CYP2C19 *1/*2). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be described using their assignment reference SNP cluster ID (rsID) or based on the location of the base pair or amino acid impacted.

=== Phenotype ===
In 2017 CPIC published results of an expert survey to standardize terms related to clinical pharmacogenetic test results. Consensus for terms to describe allele functional status, phenotype for drug metabolizing enzymes, phenotype for drug transporters, and phenotype for high-risk genotype status was reached.

== Applications ==

The list below provides a few more commonly known applications of pharmacogenomics:
* Improve drug safety, and reduce ADRs;
* Tailor treatments to meet patients&#x27; unique genetic pre-disposition, identifying optimal dosing;
* Improve drug discovery targeted to human disease; and
* Improve proof of principle for efficacy trials.
Pharmacogenomics may be applied to several areas of medicine, including pain management, cardiology, oncology, and psychiatry. A place may also exist in forensic pathology, in which pharmacogenomics can be used to determine the cause of death in drug-related deaths where no findings emerge using autopsy.

In cancer treatment, pharmacogenomics tests are used to identify which patients are most likely to respond to certain cancer drugs. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include KRAS test with cetuximab and EGFR test with gefitinib. Beside efficacy, germline pharmacogenetics can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU. In particular, genetic deregulations affecting genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA and CYP2D6 are now considered as critical issues for patients treated with 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, mercaptopurine/azathioprine, gemcitabine/capecitabine/AraC and tamoxifen, respectively.

In cardiovascular disorders, the main concern is response to drugs including warfarin, clopidogrel, beta blockers, and statins. In patients with CYP2C19, who take clopidogrel, cardiovascular risk is elevated, leading to medication package insert updates by regulators. In patients with type 2 diabetes, haptoglobin (Hp) genotyping shows an effect on cardiovascular disease, with Hp2-2 at higher risk and supplemental vitamin E reducing risk by affecting HDL.

In psychiatry, as of 2010, research has focused particularly on 5-HTTLPR and DRD2.

=== Clinical implementation ===

Initiatives to spur adoption by clinicians include the Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics (U-PGx) program in Europe and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in the United States. In a 2017 survey of European clinicians, in the prior year two-thirds had not ordered a pharmacogenetic test.

In 2010, Vanderbilt University Medical Center launched Pharmacogenomic Resource for Enhanced Decisions in Care and Treatment (PREDICT); in 2015 survey, two-thirds of the clinicians had ordered a pharmacogenetic test.

In 2019, the largest private health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, announced that it would pay for genetic testing to predict response to psychiatric drugs.

In 2020, Canada&#x27;s 4th largest health and dental insurer, Green Shield Canada, announced that it would pay for pharmacogenetic testing and its associated clinical decision support software to optimize and personalize mental health prescriptions.

=== Reduction of polypharmacy ===

A potential role for pharmacogenomics is to reduce the occurrence of polypharmacy: it is theorized that with tailored drug treatments, patients will not need to take several medications to treat the same condition. Thus they could potentially reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, improve treatment outcomes, and save costs by avoiding purchase of some medications. For example, maybe due to inappropriate prescribing, psychiatric patients tend to receive more medications than age-matched non-psychiatric patients.

The need for pharmacogenomically tailored drug therapies may be most evident in a survey conducted by the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University from February 1998 to April 2007. The study elucidated that an average of 82% of adults in the United States are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement), and 29% are taking five or more. The study suggested that those aged 65 years or older continue to be the biggest consumers of medications, with 17-19% in this age group taking at least ten medications in a given week. Polypharmacy has also shown to have increased since 2000 from 23% to 29%.

== Example case studies ==

&quot;Case A – Antipsychotic adverse reaction&quot;

Patient A has schizophrenia. Their treatment included a combination of ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benztropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transitioned to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduced into their treatment, due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they had gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremors and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain and sedation, and developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheeling and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, which has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with a predicted phenotype of IM as well.

&quot;Case B – Pain Management&quot;

Patient B is a woman who gave birth by caesarian section. Her physician prescribed codeine for post-caesarian pain. She took the standard prescribed dose, but she experienced nausea and dizziness while she was taking codeine. She also noticed that her breastfed infant was lethargic and feeding poorly. When the patient mentioned these symptoms to her physician, they recommended that she discontinue codeine use. Within a few days, both the patient&#x27;s and her infant&#x27;s symptoms were no longer present. It is assumed that if the patient had undergone a pharmacogenomic test, it would have revealed she may have had a duplication of the gene CYP2D6, placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her reactions to codeine use.

&quot;Case C – FDA Warning on Codeine Overdose for Infants&quot;

On February 20, 2013, the FDA released a statement addressing a serious concern regarding the connection between children who are known as CYP2D6 UM, and fatal reactions to codeine following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (surgery to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids). They released their strongest Boxed Warning to elucidate the dangers of CYP2D6 UMs consuming codeine. Codeine is converted to morphine by CYP2D6, and those who have UM phenotypes are in danger of producing large amounts of morphine due to the increased function of the gene. The morphine can elevate to life-threatening or fatal amounts, as became evident with the death of three children in August 2012.

== Challenges ==

Although there appears to be a general acceptance of the basic tenet of pharmacogenomics amongst physicians and healthcare professionals, several challenges exist that slow the uptake, implementation, and standardization of pharmacogenomics. Some of the concerns raised by physicians include:

* Limitation on how to apply the test into clinical practices and treatment;
* A general feeling of lack of availability of the test;
* The understanding and interpretation of evidence-based research;
* Combining test results with other patient data for prescription optimization; and
* Ethical, legal and social issues.

Issues surrounding the availability of the test include:
* &quot;The lack of availability of scientific data&quot;: Although there are a considerable number of drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of drugs, only a fraction have sufficient scientific data to validate their use within a clinical setting; and
* &quot;Demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics&quot;: Publications for the pharmacoeconomics of pharmacogenomics are scarce, therefore sufficient evidence does not at this time exist to validate the cost-effectiveness and cost-consequences of the test.

Although other factors contribute to the slow progression of pharmacogenomics (such as developing guidelines for clinical use), the above factors appear to be the most prevalent. Increasingly substantial evidence and industry body guidelines for clinical use of pharmacogenetics have made it a population wide approach to precision medicine. Cost, reimbursement, education, and easy use at the point of care remain significant barriers to widescale adoption.

== Controversies ==

=== Race-based medicine ===
There has been call to move away from race and ethnicity in medicine and instead use genetic ancestry as a way to categorize patients. Some alleles that vary in frequency between specific populations have been shown to be associated with differential responses to specific drugs. As a result, some disease-specific guidelines only recommend pharmacogenetic testing for populations where high-risk alleles are more common and, similarly, certain insurance companies will only pay for pharmacogenetic testing for beneficiaries of high-risk populations.

=== Genetic exceptionalism ===
In the early 2000s, handling genetic information as exceptional, including legal or regulatory protections, garnered strong support. It was argued that genomic information may need special policy and practice protections within the context of electronic health records (EHRs). In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was enacted to protect patients from health insurance companies discriminating against an individual based on genetic information.

More recently it has been argued that genetic exceptionalism is past its expiration date as we move into a blended genomic/big data era of medicine, yet exceptionalism practices continue to permeate clinical healthcare today. Garrison et al. recently relayed a call to action to update verbiage from genetic exceptionalism to genomic contextualism in that we recognize a fundamental duality of genetic information. This allows room in the argument for different types of genetic information to be handled differently while acknowledging that genomic information is similar and yet distinct from other health-related information. Genomic contextualism would allow for a case-by-case analysis of the technology and the context of its use (e.g., clinical practice, research, secondary findings).

Others argue that genetic information is indeed distinct from other health-related information but not to the extent of requiring legal/regulatory protections, similar to other sensitive health-related data such as HIV status. Additionally, Evans et al. argue that the EHR has sufficient privacy standards to hold other sensitive information such as social security numbers and that the fundamental nature of an EHR is to house highly personal information. Similarly, a systematic review reported that the public had concern over privacy of genetic information, with 60% agreeing that maintaining privacy was not possible; however, 96% agreed that a direct-to-consumer testing company had protected their privacy, with 74% saying their information would be similarly or better protected in an EHR. With increasing technological capabilities in EHRs, it is possible to mask or hide genetic data from subsets of providers and there is not consensus on how, when, or from whom genetic information should be masked. Rigorous protection and masking of genetic information is argued to impede further scientific progress and clinical translation into routine clinical practices.

== History ==

Pharmacogenomics was first recognized by Pythagoras around 510 BC when he made a connection between the dangers of fava bean ingestion with hemolytic anemia and oxidative stress. In the 1950s, this identification was validated and attributed to deficiency of G6PD and is called favism. Although the first official publication was not until 1961, the unofficial beginnings of this science were around the 1950s. Reports of prolonged paralysis and fatal reactions linked to genetic variants in patients who lacked butyrylcholinesterase (&#x27;pseudocholinesterase&#x27;) following succinylcholine injection during anesthesia were first reported in 1956. The term pharmacogenetics was first coined in 1959 by Friedrich Vogel of Heidelberg, Germany (although some papers suggest it was 1957 or 1958). In the late 1960s, twin studies supported the inference of genetic involvement in drug metabolism, with identical twins sharing remarkable similarities in drug response compared to fraternal twins. The term pharmacogenomics first began appearing around the 1990s.

The first FDA approval of a pharmacogenetic test was in 2005 (for alleles in &quot;CYP2D6&quot; and &quot;CYP2C19&quot;)

== Future ==

Computational advances have enabled cheaper and faster sequencing. Research has focused on combinatorial chemistry, genomic mining, omic technologies, and high throughput screening.

As the cost per genetic test decreases, the development of personalized drug therapies will increase. Technology now allows for genetic analysis of hundreds of target genes involved in medication metabolism and response in less than 24 hours for under $1,000. This a huge step towards bringing pharmacogenetic technology into everyday medical decisions. Likewise, companies like deCODE genetics, MD Labs Pharmacogenetics, Navigenics and 23andMe offer genome scans. The companies use the same genotyping chips that are used in GWAS studies and provide customers with a write-up of individual risk for various traits and diseases and testing for 500,000 known SNPs. Costs range from $995 to $2500 and include updates with new data from studies as they become available. The more expensive packages even included a telephone session with a genetics counselor to discuss the results.

== Ethics ==
Pharmacogenetics has become a controversial issue in the area of bioethics. Privacy and confidentiality are major concerns. The evidence of benefit or risk from a genetic test may only be suggestive, which could cause dilemmas for providers. Drug development may be affected, with rare genetic variants possibly receiving less research. Access and patient autonomy are also open to discussion.

<doc id="1004490" wikidata="Q7800220" url="?curid=1004490" title="Tianjin dialect">
<text>The Tianjin dialect () is a Mandarin dialect spoken in the city of Tianjin, China. It is comprehensible to speakers of other Mandarin dialects, though its greatest deviation from the others lies in its individual tones, and the lack of retroflex consonants. The regional characteristics make the dialect an important part of the Tianjin city identity, and sharply contrasts with the dialect of nearby Beijing, despite relatively similar phonology.

==Characteristics==
The Tianjin dialect is classified under Jilu Mandarin, a subdivision of Mandarin Chinese dialects also spoken in Hebei and Shandong provinces. Despite Tianjin being a neighbor of Beijing, its dialect sounds very different from the Beijing dialect, which is the basis for Standard Chinese.

The tones of the Tianjin dialect correspond to those of the Beijing dialect (and hence Standard Chinese) as follows:

The differences are minor except for the first tone: Where it is high and level in Beijing, it is low and falling in Tianjin. All words with the first tone, including the name &quot;Tianjin&quot;, are affected, giving the Tianjin dialect a downward feel to people from Beijing.

The Tianjin dialect also includes four tone sandhi rules, more than the Beijing dialect. They are,
#Tone 1 + Tone 1 → Tone 3-Tone 1: 天津 &quot;tiān jīn&quot; is pronounced /tǐanjīn/ (using Pinyin tone diacritics)
#Tone 3 + Tone 3 → Tone 2-Tone 3: 水果 &quot;shuǐ guǒ&quot; is pronounced /shuíguǒ/ (as in Standard)
#Tone 4 + Tone 4 → Tone 1-Tone 4: 現在 &quot;xiàn zài&quot; is pronounced /xiānzài/
#Tone 4 + Tone 1 → Tone 2-Tone 1: 上班 &quot;shàng bān&quot; is pronounced /shángbān/

There are some other patterns that differentiate the Tianjin dialect from the Beijing dialect. One is the pronunciation of 饿 (餓) as &quot;wò&quot; (臥) instead of &quot;è&quot;.

Lastly, the Tianjin dialect lacks the retroflex consonants () prevalent in Beijing, not unlike Taiwanese Mandarin. Thus, &quot;zh&quot; (ㄓ) becomes &quot;z&quot; (ㄗ), &quot;sh&quot; (ㄕ) becomes &quot;s&quot; (ㄙ), &quot;ch&quot; (ㄔ) becomes &quot;c&quot; (ㄘ), and &quot;r&quot; (ㄖ) becomes &quot;y&quot; (一) — that is, is pronounced &quot;yěn&quot; instead of &quot;rén&quot;, and is pronounced &quot;yàng&quot; (樣) instead of &quot;ràng&quot;. However, the use of the &quot;-er&quot; (儿) diminutive is common in the Tianjin dialect, as it is throughout the north and northeast. (See: Erhua.)

Chinese speakers commonly stereotype the Tianjin dialect as aggressive- or confrontational-sounding, though it is not difficult for speakers of other Mandarin dialects to understand.

<text>Neil Shaka Hislop CM (born 22 February 1969) is a football commentator and former player who played as a goalkeeper. Born in England, he played for them at under-21 level before representing Trinidad and Tobago at senior international level.

Hislop spent majority of his playing career in the top division in England where he was a part of the Newcastle United team which finished second in the Premier League for two successive seasons under Kevin Keegan&#x27;s first tenure. Before this, he played for Reading, where he was on the losing side in the First Division play-offs despite finishing second overall (the only occasion on which second place was not an automatic promotion position). He later played for West Ham United on two occasions (receiving an FA Cup runners-up medal during his second season in 2006) and also for Portsmouth (where he won the First Division in 2002/03).

Hislop was eligible to play for both England and Trinidad and Tobago. He initially played for the England U-21 team and was on the bench for a full International against Chile, but in the end opted to play for Trinidad and Tobago. A dispute with the national team ruled him out of contention for several years, but he returned to play and starred in the country&#x27;s first ever World Cup appearance in 2006.

Hislop is now working for sports news and broadcasting service ESPN where he is most often seen as a commentator on ESPN FC. He had also briefly worked as a goalkeeping coach for the football team at Quinnipiac University.

==Club career==
===Early career===
At an early age, Hislop wanted to be a striker, but was thrust in goal as he was the tallest player on his team. He eventually grew to just under 6&#x27;5&quot; in height. After graduating from St. Mary&#x27;s College in Trinidad, Hislop earned a scholarship to play college soccer at Howard University in the United States and led his team to the NCAA Final as a freshman starter. He graduated from Howard with honours with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. During this time, he interned at NASA.

===Reading===
Shortly after graduating, Hislop was spotted by a scout from Reading at a friendly indoor match against Aston Villa of the Premier League. He went on to sign professional forms with Reading for the 1992–93 season and remained there for two more years. While there, he established himself as a firm fan favourite after an uncertain start, twice earning the club&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award. He was instrumental in Reading&#x27;s rise from the third tier of English football to the brink of the Premier League, where he narrowly missed out on promotion following a 4–3 defeat to Bolton Wanderers in the 1995 play-off final, and was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Season in 1994–95. Hislop was one of many Reading players to move that summer of 1995, signing with Newcastle United for £1.575m. In a poll to compile the Royals&#x27; greatest-ever XI, Hislop was voted the best goalkeeper with 46.7% of the vote ahead of Steve Death and Marcus Hahnemann. He was also voted joint third along with Death in a poll to decide the club&#x27;s &#x27;Player of the Millennium&#x27;.

===Newcastle United===
Hislop&#x27;s first season at Newcastle United was spent battling with incumbent goalkeeper Pavel Srníček for the starting role. After starting strongly and being the starter through until December 1995, Hislop suffered an injury against Chelsea that allowed Srníček to regain the starting role. Hislop then didn&#x27;t return until April 1996 for the final 6 games of the season. That season Newcastle blew a 12-point lead in January to finish the season in second place.

In 1996–97, Hislop started the first league game of the season against Everton but then remained on the bench thereafter. He had to watch Srníček tend the nets until a perceived dip in form and a number of mistakes from Srníček allowed Hislop to take the starting role back again in December 1996, and he made only his second league start of the year in a 7–1 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur. Hislop successfully retained the starting position until the final 4 games of the season when Srníček returned, as Newcastle pipped Arsenal and Liverpool to second place on goal difference at the end of the season.

Hislop&#x27;s role further came under threat when new manager Kenny Dalglish opted to purchase a former player of his own from Blackburn Rovers. Dalglish brought in Shay Given, costing £1.5 million, and a season-long battle for the number one spot ensued between the two goalkeepers. Given initially started the season, but after a string of defeats and five games without a win, Dalglish went back to Hislop in November and he stayed there until an injury in February allowed Given back into the frame. With his contract running out, and having not yet managed to play a full season at Newcastle, Hislop chose to leave on a free transfer.

===West Ham United===
West Ham United had operated a &quot;goalkeeper by committee&quot; approach the previous season, seeing first Luděk Mikloško, then Craig Forrest, then Bernard Lama hold the starting role. With Mikloško now with Queens Park Rangers and with the team being unable to secure Lama beyond his three-month loan, Harry Redknapp snapped up Hislop and installed him as first choice goalkeeper.

In 1998–99, Hislop&#x27;s first season saw him provide excellent service to the team, culminating in winning the &quot;Hammer of the Year&quot; award at the first attempt. His following season seemed to be following suit until he broke his leg in a match against Bradford City. The game saw young Stephen Bywater make his league debut in a 5–4 victory, but signalled the end of Hislop&#x27;s season.

Hislop returned the following year in 2000–01 but in a tumultuous season, he saw his manager fired, and two of the club&#x27;s most promising players in Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard sold on. His performances were strong in an unsettled team. However, new manager Glenn Roeder purchased the unsettled David James from Aston Villa, who had publicly fallen foul of his manager John Gregory. The deal was seen as a coup for West Ham, though it resigned Hislop to the bench for what was seen to be his final season with the club as James (a year younger) was intended to be the obvious long-term option.

However, before the 2001–02 season could even start, James tore his knee ligaments on England-duty after a collision with Martin Keown. The injury ruled James out for the first three months of the season. Hislop instantly stepped back into his starting role and kept five clean sheets in his 12 appearances that year for the club (though he also featured in the back to back drubbings from Everton 5–0 and Blackburn Rovers 7–1. However, James reclaimed the starting role, and on 1 July 2002, Hislop left the club on a free transfer.

===Portsmouth===
Hislop joined Portsmouth after Harry Redknapp became their new manager. He quickly asserted himself as the starter in the side that won the First Division title, ensuring automatic promotion to the Premier League. In recognition of his exploits for the season he was named in the First Division&#x27;s &#x27;Team of the Year&#x27; and remained first choice for the next two seasons in the Premiership, despite competition from Harald Wapenaar and later, Jamie Ashdown. In January 2005, following the replacement of Redknapp as manager, his replacement Velimir Zajec signed Greek international Konstantinos Chalkias and Hislop faced more competition for a place on the team.

Following the appointment of a new manager Alain Perrin, Hislop failed to regain his starting place in favour of ex-Liverpool keeper Sander Westerveld, and when his contract expired in June 2005, he was released by the club.

===Return to West Ham===
On 29 July 2005, Hislop rejoined West Ham as experienced cover along with Jimmy Walker for new signing Roy Carroll, allowing Stephen Bywater to go out on loan. Carroll started strongly but a back injury saw Hislop make occasional appearances through the season until Christmas. In January, Carroll&#x27;s injury forced him to the physio&#x27;s table once again, and Hislop stepped back into the fold as the starter (rotating with Walker). He featured in every FA Cup game as the team made its way to the final against Liverpool, keeping seven clean sheets in 27 appearances. The FA Cup Final finished 3–3 after a late equaliser from Steven Gerrard in the 91st minute. Hislop saving Sami Hyypiä&#x27;s penalty was not enough for his team as Liverpool won the game 3–1 on penalty kicks after Anton Ferdinand missed the final West Ham spot kick of the day.

===FC Dallas===
On 5 July 2006, Hislop signed for Major League Soccer team FC Dallas in the United States. After suffering a back injury, Hislop left FC Dallas and retired from professional football in August 2007.

==International career==
===Youth===
Hislop was a youth international for Trinidad and Tobago. He had played in three games for Trinidad and Tobago before 1989.

In 1992, he was called up to the Trinidad national football team but was an unused substitute in three games. In May 1995, he said that he would prefer to play for England as he was born and raised there, and the standard of competition was higher.

===England===
Hislop was called up for England against Chile at Wembley Stadium in February 1998. A month later, at the age of 29, he was one of three over-age players selected to play for the England U-21 side against Switzerland.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Eventually, Hislop chose to represent Trinidad and Tobago at the senior level. He played a total of 26 times for the Twin Island nation, also captaining the team in five matches.

Hislop had announced his retirement from international football in 2004, citing the long journeys between England and the Caribbean as a factor, but returned to the national team to aid them in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers at the request of the Trinidad and Tobago national team management. In 2005, he was part of the Trinidad and Tobago side that qualified for the 2006 World Cup with a victory over Bahrain. The draw for the World Cup placed them in Group B alongside Sweden, Paraguay and England. On 10 June 2006, Hislop played in the Trinidad and Tobago national team&#x27;s first ever World Cup match, a 0–0 draw against Sweden, replacing Kelvin Jack who suffered a calf injury in the warm-up. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, he would call the occasion &#x27;the proudest day of his career&#x27;.

==Coaching career==
On 17 March 2009, Hislop signed a contract to be an assistant coach while primarily working with the goalkeepers of the Quinnipiac University football team. After a brief period he resigned as coach due to his media commitments with ESPN.

==Media work==
In 2008, Hislop began a weekly blog covering Major League Soccer for the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s website. He works as a commentator on ESPN FC TV and in addition to commentary he has also interviewed several major footballing figures, including his former club manager Harry Redknapp after his move from Portsmouth to Tottenham Hotspur, USA international goalkeeper Kasey Keller, and Portuguese manager José Mourinho after he led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2015.

==Personal life==
Hislop married his wife, Desha, in 1995. He is the cousin of American sprint athlete Natasha Hastings. He has 5 children.

His brother Kona played for Livingston and Hartlepool.

In July 2023, Hislop collapsed on air while working as an analyst for ESPN at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena. He later described the incident as &quot;awkward&quot; and said that he was seeking medical opinion.

<text>Wilson Marion Cooper (December 17, 1850 – July 17, 1916) of Dothan, Alabama, was a notable musician and music teacher within the Sacred Harp tradition. Marion Cooper was born in Henry County, Alabama, the son of W. S. and Elizabeth Ann (Oates) Cooper. He was a cousin of Alabama governor William C. Oates.

== Overview ==

W. M. Cooper prepared a revision of B. F. White&#x27;s tune book &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; in 1902. In the revision, some songs were transposed to a different key, and some of the old tune names changed to descriptive titles based on the words of the hymns. Some old songs were removed and new songs added in their places.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of his book was adding alto parts to the songs, the majority of which were originally written with three vocal lines (treble, tenor, bass). Cooper wrote most of the alto lines himself, though his daughter Anna Blackshear and other individuals made important contributions. Believing this was significant and unique, Cooper sued J. S. James after James in 1911 released an edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; also including alto parts. James&#x27; alto parts (many of which were written by S. M. Denson) were very close to those supplied to the songs by Cooper. In 1914, a judge found in favor of James, concluding, &quot;An alto may be an improvement to a song to some extent, and probably is; but it can hardly be said to be an original composition, at least in the sense of the copyright law... In my opinion Mr. James has not infringed any legal rights of Cooper to the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;...&quot;

Some musicologists believe that the addition of alto to the songs of the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; substantially changed their texture. In &quot;The Alto Parts in the &#x27;True Dispersed Harmony&#x27; of The Sacred Harp Revisions&quot;, Wallace McKenzie argues that the added altos, especially of the Cooper book, follow principles of &quot;true dispersed harmony&quot; and do not greatly change the texture of the music. McKenzie wrote, &quot;Cooper&#x27;s altos maintain some features of the contrapuntal-harmonic style described above somewhat more closely than do those of Denson... In both books, however, the alto melodies are consistent with the contrapuntal-harmonic style of the three-part pieces.&quot;

Cooper&#x27;s added alto parts in the style and texture of White and King&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; reveal a knowledge of and loyalty to the tradition. However, Cooper chose to add another style of song to the existing tradition—the late 19th century gospel song. During this period, the seven-shape notation and gospel style were seriously encroaching on the Sacred Harp&#x27;s territory and popularity. The Ruebush-Kieffer Publishing Company and others were making &quot;seven-shapes&quot; the standard notation of the South. Some Sacred Harp leaders (particularly James and his colleagues) responded by rejecting both the gospel style and the seven-shape notation. Cooper maintained the four-shape notation, but incorporated some of the gospel style songs into his book—for example, &quot;Beautiful River (Shall We Gather at the River)&quot; and &quot;Sweet By and By&quot;. Cooper also experimented with placing the notation on two staves instead of four, but this was rejected by his supporters.

The Cooper revision of the Sacred Harp was widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, south Georgia and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The &quot;Cooper book,&quot; as it is often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909; and since then has been supervised by an editorial committee, which produced new editions in 1927, 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006, and 2012. Recent research has revealed that a few songs were added to the book between 1909 and 1927.

Cooper also edited a monthly musical periodical, &quot;Zion Songster&quot;, at Dothan in the early part of the 20th century.

== Family ==

Cooper married Mary S. Hayes, daughter of George W. and Nancy Hayes. His children include George Hayes Cooper (1880–1929); A. W. Cooper (1886–1911), who served as a lawyer in Dothan and Luverne; and Anna L. Cooper (Mrs. R. D. Blackshear 1877–1957), who assisted her father in writing alto parts for the revision. She and her husband, Dr. Randall David Blackshear (1861–1941), owned and published the &quot;Revised Sacred Harp&quot; after Cooper&#x27;s death.

In addition to music, W. M. Cooper&#x27;s activities included working as a farmer, school teacher, and insurance agent. He is known to have lived in at least four Alabama counties—Coffee, Dale, Henry and Houston. He ran for Houston County Superintendent of Schools in 1912. Mary died in 1901 and is buried at the Old Tabernacle Methodist Cemetery in Coffee County, Alabama.

W. M. Cooper died in Palm Beach, Florida and is buried in the Dothan City Cemetery in Houston County, Alabama.

<text>The expressway network of China, with the national-level expressway system officially known as the National Trunk Highway System (; abbreviated as NTHS), is an integrated system of national and provincial-level expressways in China.

With the construction of the Shenyang–Dalian Expressway beginning between the cities of Shenyang and Dalian on 7 June 1984, the Chinese government started to take an interest in a national expressway system. The first modern at-grade China National Highways is the Shanghai–Jiading Expressway, opened in October 1988. The early 1990s saw the start of the country&#x27;s massive plan to upgrade its network of roads. On 13 January 2005, Zhang Chunxian, China&#x27;s Minister of Transport introduced the 7918 network, later renamed the 71118 network, composed of a grid of 7 radial expressways from Beijing, 9 north–south expressways (increased to 11), and 18 east–west expressways that would form the backbone of the national expressway system.

By the end of 2020, the total length of China&#x27;s expressway network reached , the world&#x27;s largest expressway system by length, having surpassed the overall length of the American Interstate Highway System in 2011. Many of the major expressways parallel routes of the older China National Highways. By the end of 2022, the total length of China&#x27;s expressway network reached . By end of 2023, the total length of China&#x27;s expressway network reached .

== History ==
=== Origins ===

Prior to the 1980s, freight and passenger transport activities were predominantly achieved by rail transport rather than by road. The 1980s and 1990s saw a growing trend toward roads as a method of transportation and a shift away from rail transport. In 1978, rail transport accounted for 54.4 percent of the total freight movement in China, while road transport only accounted for 2.8 per cent. By 1997, road transport&#x27;s share of freight movement had increased to 13.8 percent while the railway&#x27;s share decreased to 34.3 percent. Similarly, road&#x27;s share of passenger transport increased from 29.9% to 53.3% within the same time period, with railway&#x27;s share decreasing from 62.7 percent to 35.4 percent. The shift from rail to road can be attributed to the rapid development of the expressway network in China.

Expressways were not present in China until 1988. It began building expressways in the late 1980s. On 7 June 1984, China&#x27;s expressway ambitions began when construction of the Shenyang–Dalian Expressway began between the cities of Shenyang and Dalian. Due to policy restrictions, the expressway was nominally implemented on the first-grade automobile special highway standard in the initial stage of construction, thus making the highway technically not an expressway. Despite this, in October 1988, four years later, two full-speed, fully enclosed, controlled-accessed expressway sections from Shenyang to Anshan and Dalian to Sanshilipu totaling were completed, with the middle portion of the expressway remaining a highway. It would take until 20 August 1990, for all sections of the highway to become that of an expressway. The expressway is now part of the longer G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway.

On 21 December 1984, construction began on the Shanghai–Jiading Expressway in the city of Shanghai. The Shanghai–Jiading Expressway opened on 31 October 1988, becoming the first completed expressway in China. This expressway now forms part of Shanghai&#x27;s expressway network. In December 1987, construction of the long Jingjintang Expressway started, connecting the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the province of Hebei. It the first expressway in mainland China that uses a World Bank loan for international open bidding. The expressway was opened on 25 September 1993 and later became part of the G2 Beijing–Shanghai Expressway.

On 3 September 1998, Huabei Expressway Co., Ltd., Northeast Expressway Co., Ltd., Hunan Changyong Expressway Co., Ltd., and Guangxi Wuzhou Transportation Co., Ltd. were approved by the government as the first batch of nationally issued stock companies that would develop, construct, and operate expressways in China.

=== Modernization ===

On 13 January 2005, Zhang Chunxian, China&#x27;s Minister of Transport announced that China would build a network of expressways over the next three decades, connecting all provincial capitals and cities with a population of over 200,000 residents. The announcement introduced the 7918 network, a grid of 7 radial expressways from Beijing, 9 north–south expressways, and 18 east–west expressways that would form the backbone of the national expressway system. This replaced the earlier proposal for five north–south and seven east–west core routes, proposed in 1992.

In June 2013, the Ministry of Transport introduced the National Highway Network Planning, covering both the national highway system and the national expressway system from 2013 to 2030. Goals include making traffic travel more convenient and developing a variety of regions, as well as more focus to the highways and expressways of the western regions of China. According to this plan, the total size of the national road network will reach , including of common national highways and about of expressways. In addition, the 7918 network would be renamed the 71118 network when the number of north–south expressways were increased from 9 to 11. Huang Min, director of the Basic Industry Department of the Development and Reform Commission, said that whether the plan is for ordinary national roads, the development of expressways is prioritized more in the western regions. According to Huang, the two expressways were to be added to the western region, while none in the northern, eastern, or southern regions.
In 2014, Wang Tai, deputy director of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced the national toll highway mileage and mainline toll stations.

On 6 November 2015, Hu Zuicai, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, introduced a reform policy for construction of China&#x27;s expressway system that was approved by the State Council. Hu claimed that the current highway construction is facing problems such as pre-approval and evaluation assessment. Through simplification and integration of examination and approval stages, it will help speed up the pace of highway construction, promote urban development in the region, and help stabilize growth and promote investment. This policy, during the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan” period, would focus on five aspects:
* Speeds up the building of expressways, especially to link the broken roads between the provinces as soon as possible, and to play the overall role of the expressway system; 
* Supports the three major strategies and strengthen the important domestic and inter-provincial channels of the international economic cooperation corridor, connecting important coastal highways along the coast of the Yangtze River and linking the construction of important port highways; 
* Serves new urbanization and urban agglomerations, and connecting cities and cities within urban agglomerations between cities and cities is the key to construction; 
* Supports poverty alleviation and cracks down on poverty by linking between cities and regions;
* Efforts are made to improve the efficiency of transportation, so that the freeway and other modes of transport can be seamlessly connected or transferred and the overall transportation efficiency can be improved.
In 2020, all toll booths at provincial borders were abolished in favour of ETC, greatly reducing traffic congestion.

In 2022, the NDRC and MOT published a new National Highway Network Plan (), added and re-formed several expressways and national highways. It is expected that all national expressways will connect prefecture-level administrative regions (except Sansha), other cities and counties with 100,000 and more populations, and important border checkpoints.

==Safety==
In 2008 the rate of fatalities on Chinese expressways is 3.3 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-km. Nonetheless, the fatality rate on Chinese expressways is five times higher than 
western countries which have a 0.7 rate. In 2010 the total expressway mileage accounted for only 1.85 percent of highway mileage driven, however accidents on expressways made up 13.54% of highway traffic deaths. For the 2011-2015 period this was still at 10%. The accidents are mainly caused by tailgating, fatigue and speeding.

== Expressway nomenclature ==

Neither officially named &quot;motorway&quot; nor &quot;highway&quot;, China used to call these roads &quot;freeways&quot;. In this sense, the word &quot;free&quot; means that the traffic is free-flowing; that is, cross traffic is grade separated and the traffic on the freeway is not impeded by traffic control devices like traffic lights and stop signs. Some time in the 1990s, &quot;expressways&quot; became the standardised term.

Note that &quot;highways&quot; refers to China National Highways, which are not expressways at all.

&quot;Express routes&quot; exist too; they are akin to expressways but are mainly inside cities. The &quot;express route&quot; name is a derivation of the Chinese name &quot;kuaisu gonglu&quot; (compare with expressway, &quot;gaosu gonglu&quot;). Officially, &quot;expressway&quot; is used for both expressways and express routes, which is also the standard used here.

The names of the individual expressways are regularly composed of two characters representing start and end of expressway, e.g. &quot;Jingcheng&quot; expressway is the expressway between &quot;Jing&quot; (meaning Beijing) and Chengde.

===Speed limits===

The Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China stipulates the speed limit of , effective since 1 May 2004.

A minimum speed limit of is in force. On overtaking lanes, however, this could be as high as . Penalties for driving both below and in excess of the prescribed speed limits are enforced.

Some expressways have a lower design speed of .

===Legislation===
Only motor vehicles are allowed to enter expressways. As of 1 May 2004, &quot;new drivers&quot; (i.e., those with a Chinese driver&#x27;s licence for less than a year) are allowed on expressways, something that was prohibited from the mid-1990s.

Overtaking on the right, speeding, and illegal use of the emergency belt (or hard shoulder) cost violators stiff penalties.

===Signage===
Expressways in China are signed in both Simplified Chinese and English (except for parts of the Jingshi Expressway, which relies only on Chinese characters, and some provinces, in Inner Mongolia for example signs are in Mongolian and Chinese, and in Xinjiang the signs are in Chinese and Uyghur Language which uses Perso-Arabic alphabet).

The signs on Chinese expressways use white lettering on a green background, like Japanese highways, Italian autostrade, Swiss autobahns and United States freeways. Newer signage places the exit number in an exit tab to the upper right of the sign, making them very similar in appearance to American freeway signs.

Exits are well indicated, with signs far ahead of exits. There are frequent signs that announce the next three exits. At each exit, there is a sign with the distance to the next exit. Exit signs are also posted , , , and ahead of the exit, immediately before the exit, and at the exit itself.

Service areas and refreshment areas are standard on some of the older, more established expressways, and are expanding in number. Gas stations are frequent.

Signs indicate exits, toll gates, service/refreshment areas, intersections, and also warn about keeping a fair distance apart. &quot;Distance checks&quot; are commonplace; the idea here is to keep the two-second rule (or, as Chinese law requires, at least a distance between cars). Speed checks and speed traps are often signposted (in fact, on the Jingshen Expressway in the Beijing section, even the cameras have a warning sign above them), but some may just be scarecrow signs. Signs urging drivers to slow down, warning about hilly terrain, banning driving in emergency lanes, or about different road surfaces are also present. Also appearing from time to time are signs signaling the overtaking lane (which legally should only be used to pass other cars). Although most English signs are comprehensible, occasionally the English is garbled.

Many expressways have digital displays. These displays may advise against speeding, indicate upcoming road construction, warn of traffic jams, or alert drivers to rain. Recommended detours are also signaled. The great majority of messages are only in Chinese.

===Exit numbering===

Exit numbering has been standardised in China from its inception. Most Chinese expressways, especially those in the national network, use distance-based exit numbering, with the last three numbers before the decimal point taken used as the exit number. Hence, an exit at km 982.7 would be Exit 982, whereas an exit at km 3,121.2 would be Exit 121. Exit numbers on Chinese expressways increase along the total length of the freeway, regardless of how many provincial boundaries the expressway crosses.

Some, mostly regional, expressways still use sequential exit numbering, although even here, new signage feature distance-based exit numbering. Before the 2009–2010 numbering switchover, nearly all of China&#x27;s expressways used sequential numbering, and a few expressways used Chinese names outright.

One of the reasons for this shift is that distance-based exit numbering comes in handy when newly built exits are added to an expressway exit system. If sequential numbering is used, numbers of all the exits following the new exit have to be replaced, which will be a troublesome and costly project. But that will not be a problem for distance-based exit numbering.

The exit is written inside an oval in green letters to the immediate right of the Chinese word for exit, &quot;出口&quot; (chukou).

==Financing==
=== Costs ===
The total costs of the national expressway network are estimated to be 2 trillion yuan (some US$300 billion as rate in 2016). From 2005 to 2010, the annual investment was planned to run from 140 billion to 150 billion yuan (17 to 18 billion U.S. dollars), while from 2010 to 2020, the annual investment planned is to be around 100 billion yuan.

The construction fund will come from vehicle purchase tax, fees and taxes collected by local governments, state bonds, domestic investment and foreign investment. Unlike other freeway systems, almost all of the roads on the NTHS/&quot;7918 Network&quot; are toll roads that are largely financed by private companies under contract from provincial governments. The private companies raise money through bond and stock offerings and recover money through tolls. Examples of these companies include Huabei Expressway Co., Ltd., Northeast Expressway Co., Ltd., Hunan Changyong Expressway Co., Ltd., and Guangxi Wuzhou Transportation Co., Ltd.

Efforts to impose a national gasoline tax to finance construction of the tollways met with opposition and it has been very difficult for both the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council to pass such a tax through the National People&#x27;s Congress of China.

=== Tollways ===
China has an extensive tollway system, which composed of nearly all expressways as well as having around 70% of the world&#x27;s tollways. Tolls are roughly around CNY 0.5 per kilometer, and minimum rates (e.g. CNY 5) usually apply regardless of distance. However, some are more expensive (the Jinji Expressway costs around CNY 0.66 per kilometer) and some are less expensive (the Jingshi Expressway in Beijing costs around CNY 0.33 per kilometer). It is noteworthy that cheaper expressways do not necessarily mean poorer roads or a greater risk of traffic congestion.

Roads in Tibet and Hainan are all toll free. In Tibet, this is done to stimulate economic development, whereas in Hainan, the cost is covered by a provincial fuel tax, first instated in 1994. Tolls are waived nationwide during national holidays, such as Golden Week, and regionally for locally observed holidays. For example, Xinjiang makes all expressway travel free during Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

Expressway planning is performed by the Ministry of Transport of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Unlike the road networks in most nations, most Chinese expressways are not directly owned by the state, but rather are owned by for-profit corporations (which have varying amounts of public and private ownership) which borrow money from banks or securities markets based on revenue from projected tollways. Examples of these corporations include Huabei Expressway Co., Ltd., Northeast Expressway Co., Ltd., Hunan Changyong Expressway Co., Ltd., and Guangxi Wuzhou Transportation Co., Ltd. One reason for this is that Chinese provinces, which are responsible for road building, have extremely limited powers to tax and even fewer powers to borrow.

Since the late-1990s, there were proposals to fund public highways by means of a fuel tax, but this was voted down by the National People&#x27;s Congress.

China&#x27;s tollways were criticized for having excessively high toll fees. According to Zhongxin.com, by reducing toll fees, it will lead to logistic costs reductions, another problem encountered by the country&#x27;s expressway system. Reforms of the tollway system were planned by the National People&#x27;s Congress with the inclusion of cost reduction of bridges.

However, the toll system was also praised by the World Bank for encouraging construction/maintenance, discouraging overuse, and not unduly favouring roads over other forms of transportation like rail.

====Methods====
Most expressways use a card system. Upon entrance to an expressway (or to a toll portion of the expressway), an entry card is handed over to the driver. The tolls to be paid are determined from the distance traveled when the driver hands the entry card back to the exit toll gate upon leaving the expressway. A small number of expressways do not use a card system but charge unitary fares. Passage through these expressways is relatively faster but it is economically less advantageous. An example of such an expressway would be the Jingtong Expressway.

China is increasingly deploying a network of electronic toll collection (ETC) systems, and in the latest edition of expressway toll gate signage, a new ETC sign is now shown at an increasing number of toll gates. ETC networks based around Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province all feature either mixed toll passages supporting toll card payment or full-service dedicated ETC lanes. Beijing, in particular, has a dedicated ETC lane at almost all toll gates. By 2019, 90% of traffic paid is expected to pay toll fees using the ETC system.

City transit cards are not widely used; one of the first experiments with the Beijing Yikatong Card on what is now the Jingzang Expressway (G6) went live for only a year before a new national standard replaced it in early 2008.

==Numeric system and list by number==

===G000 series===
A previous system, the 1992 &quot;five vertical + seven horizontal expressways&quot; system, was used for arterial expressways and were, in essence, G0-series expressways (e.g. G020, G025). This was replaced by the present-day new numeric system (see below).

===New numbering system===
A new system, which dates from 2004 and began use on a nationwide level between late 2009 and early 2010, integrates itself into the present-day G-series number system. The present-day network announced in 2017, termed the 7, 11, 18 Network (also known as the National Trunk Highway System, NTHS), uses one, two or four digits in the G-series numbering system, leaving three-figured G roads as the China National Highways.

The new 7, 11, 18 Network is composed of
* 7 radial expressways leaving Beijing (G1-G7)
* 11 vertical expressways going north to south (double digit G roads with numbers ending in an odd numeral)
* 18 horizontal expressways head west to east (double digit G roads with numbers ending in an even numeral)

The network is additionally composed of connection expressways as well as regional and metropolitan ring expressways.

On a nationwide basis, expressways use the G prefix (short for &quot;guojia&quot; in Chinese meaning &quot;national&quot;), as well as the character &quot;国家高速&quot; (National Expressway, white letters on a red stripe on top of the sign). For regional expressways, the prefix S (short for &quot;shengji&quot; or &quot;provincial&quot;) is used instead, as well as the one-character abbreviation of the province and &quot;高速&quot; (expressway, black letters on an orange-yellow stripe on top of the sign.) The same numbering system is used for both national and regional expressways.

====Numbering rules====

* All expressways in this network begin with the letter G. (For regional expressways, the letter S is used instead.)
* All expressways have a thin band on top of the sign. For national expressways, it will be red; for regional ones, it will be orange-yellow.
* For radial expressways leaving from or ending in Beijing, use a single digit from 1 to 9 (e.g., G1, G2).
* For north–south expressways, use an odd number from 11 to 89 (e.g., G11, G35).
* For west–east expressways, use an even number from 10 to 90 (e.g., G20, G36).
* For regional ring expressways in the 7, 11, 18 network, use numbers from 91 to 98. (e.g., G91, G93)
* For metropolitan area ring expressways, use number 99 plus numbers from 01 to 12. (e.g., G9901, G9912)
** &quot;Note: G99 or the Taiwan Ring Expressway was a planned expressway based in Taiwan Province before cancelled in 2022, which is claimed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but is actually administered by the Republic of China. (In addition, the ROC has not built the eastern half as an expressway.) See Political status of Taiwan. See also Highway system in Taiwan for the current Republic of China-maintained Taiwan freeway system, which uses a different numbering system.&quot;
* For city ring expressways, use &quot;0&quot; plus an order number after the main line number, starting from the smallest possible number (e.g., G5001).
* For connection expressways, use an odd numeral plus an order number after the main line (e.g., G9411).
* For the parallel expressways running alongside primary ones, use an even numeral (except &quot;0&quot;) plus an order number after the main line (e.g. G0422, here the corresponding main line with a single digit should follow a &quot;0&quot; to distinguish from CNH).

<doc id="1004529" wikidata="Q2529896" url="?curid=1004529" title="Palo (religion)">
<text>Palo, also known as Las Reglas de Congo, is a African diasporic religion that developed in Cuba during the late 19th or early 20th century. It draws heavily upon the traditional Kongo religion of Central Africa, with additional influences taken from Catholicism and from Spiritism. An initiatory religion practised by &quot;paleros&quot; (male) and &quot;paleras&quot; (female), Palo is organised through small autonomous groups called &quot;munanso congo&quot;, each led by a &quot;tata&quot; (father) or &quot;yayi&quot; (mother). 

Although teaching the existence of a creator divinity, commonly called Nsambi, Palo regards this entity as being uninvolved in human affairs and instead focuses its attention on the spirits of the dead. Central to Palo is the &quot;nganga&quot;, a vessel usually made from an iron cauldron. Many &quot;nganga&quot; are regarded as material manifestations of ancestral or nature deities known as &quot;mpungu&quot;. The &quot;nganga&quot; will typically contain a wide range of objects, among the most important being sticks and human remains, the latter called &quot;nfumbe&quot;. In Palo, the presence of the &quot;nfumbe&quot; means that the spirit of that dead person inhabits the &quot;nganga&quot; and serves the &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; who possesses it. The Palo practitioner commands the &quot;nganga&quot; to do their bidding, typically to heal but also to cause harm. Those &quot;nganga&quot; primarily designed for benevolent acts are baptised; those largely designed for malevolent acts are left unbaptised. The &quot;nganga&quot; is &quot;fed&quot; with the blood of sacrificed animals and other offerings, while its will and advice is interpreted through divination. Group rituals often involve singing, drumming, and dancing to facilitate possession by spirits of the dead.

Palo developed among Afro-Cuban communities following the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. It emerged largely from the traditional religions brought to Cuba by enslaved Bakongo people from Central Africa, but also incorporated ideas from Catholicism, the only religion legally permitted on the island by the Spanish colonial government. The &quot;minkisi&quot;, spirit-vessels that were key to various Bakongo healing societies, provided the basis for the &quot;nganga&quot; of Palo. The religion took its distinct form around the late 19th or early 20th century, about the same time that Yoruba religious traditions merged with Catholic and Spiritist ideas in Cuba to produce Santería. After the Cuban War of Independence resulted in an independent republic in 1898, the country&#x27;s new constitution enshrined freedom of religion. Palo nevertheless remained marginalized by Cuba&#x27;s Catholic, Euro-Cuban establishment, which typically viewed it as &quot;brujería&quot; (witchcraft), an identity that many Palo practitioners have since embraced. In the 1960s, growing emigration following the Cuban Revolution spread Palo abroad.

Palo is divided into multiple traditions or &quot;ramas&quot;, including Mayombe, Monte, Briyumba, and Kimbisa, each with their own approaches to the religion. Many practitioners also identify as Catholics and practice additional Afro-Cuban traditions such as Santería or Abakuá. Palo is most heavily practiced in eastern Cuba although it is found throughout the island and abroad, including in other parts of the Americas such as Venezuela, Mexico, and the United States. In many of these countries, Palo practitioners have faced problems with law enforcement for engaging in grave robbery to procure human bones for their &quot;nganga&quot;.

==Definitions==
Palo is an Afro-Cuban religion, and more broadly an Afro-American religion. Its name derives from &quot;palo&quot;, a Spanish term for stick, referencing the important role that such items play in the religion&#x27;s practices. Another term for the religion is &quot;La Regla de Congo&quot; (&quot;Kongo Rule&quot; or &quot;Law of Kongo&quot;) or &quot;Regla Congo&quot;, a reference to its origins among the traditional Kongo religion of Central Africa&#x27;s Bakongo people. Palo is also sometimes referred to as &quot;brujería&quot; (witchcraft), both by outsiders and by some practitioners themselves.

Although its beliefs and practices come principally from the Kongo religion, Palo also draws upon the traditional religions of other African peoples who were brought to Cuba, such as the West African Yoruba. These African elements combined with influences from Catholicism and also from Spiritism, a French variant of Spiritualism. Palo&#x27;s African heritage is important to practitioners, who often refer to their religious homeland as &quot;Ngola&quot;; this indicates a belief in the historical Kingdom of Kongo as Palo&#x27;s place of origin, a place where the spirits are more powerful.

There is no central authority in control of Palo, but separate groups of practitioners who operate autonomously. It is largely transmitted orally, and has no sacred text, nor any systematized doctrine. There is thus no overarching orthodoxy, and no strict ritual protocol, giving its practitioners scope for innovation and change. Different practitioners often interpret the religion differently, resulting in highly variable practices. Several distinct traditions or denominations of Palo exist, called &quot;ramas&quot; (&quot;branches&quot;), with the main &quot;ramas&quot; being Mayombe, Briyumba, Monte, and Kimbisa.

Practitioners are usually termed &quot;paleros&quot; if male, &quot;paleras&quot; if female, terms which can be translated as &quot;one who handles tree branches&quot;. An alternative term for adherents is &quot;mayomberos&quot;. Another term applied to Palo practitioners in Cuba is &quot;ngangulero&quot; and &quot;ngangulera&quot;, meaning &quot;a person who works a &quot;nganga&quot;, the latter being the spirit-vessel central to the religion. The term carries pejorative connotations in Cuban society although some practitioners adopt it as a term of pride. A similarly pejorative term embraced by some adherents is &quot;brujo&quot; (witch), with Palo being one of several African-derived religions in the Americas whose practitioners adopt the identity of the witch as a form of reappropriation.

===Relationship to Afro-Cuban religions===

Palo is one of three major Afro-Cuban religions present on Cuba, the other two being Santería, which derives largely from the Yoruba religion of West Africa, and Abakuá, which has its origins in the Ekpe society of West Africa&#x27;s Efik-Ibibio peoples. Many Palo initiates are also involved in Santería, Abakuá, Spiritism, or Catholicism; some Palo practitioners believe that only baptised Catholics should be initiated into the tradition. Practitioners often see these various religions as offering complementary skills and mechanisms to solve people&#x27;s issues, or alternatively as each being best suited to resolving different problems. 

&quot;Cruzar palo con cha&quot;&quot; (&quot;cross Palo with Ocha&quot;) is a phrase used to indicate that an individual practises both Palo and Santería, &quot;ocha&quot; being one of the terms used for Santería&#x27;s deities. Those following both will usually keep the rituals of the two traditions separate, with some Palo initiates objecting to the introduction of elements from Santería into their religion. If someone is to be initiated into both, generally they will be initiated into Palo first; some claim that this is because moving from Santería to Palo represents a spiritual regression, while others maintain that the &quot;oricha&quot; spirit placed within the adherent&#x27;s body during Santería initiation would not tolerate the flesh-cutting process required for initiation into Palo. 

Comparisons have also been drawn between Palo and other African-derived traditions in the Americas. Certain similarities in practice have for instance been identified between Palo and Haitian Vodou. Palo also has commonalities with Obeah, a practice found in Jamaica, and it is possible that Palo and Obeah cross-fertilised via Jamaican migration to Cuba from 1925 onward.

==Beliefs==

===Deities and spirits===

Although Palo lacks a full mythology, its worldview includes a supreme creator divinity, Nsambi or Sambia. In the religion&#x27;s mythology, Nsambi is believed responsible for creating the world and the first man and woman. This entity is regarded as being remote and inaccessible from humanity, and thus no prayers or sacrifices are directed towards it. The anthropologist Todd Ramón Ochoa, an initiate of Palo Briyumba, describes Nsambi as &quot;the power in matter that pushes back against human manipulation and imposes itself against a person&#x27;s will&quot;. In the context of Afro-Cuban religion, Nsambi has been compared to Olofi in Santería and Abasí in Abakuá.

In Palo, veneration is directed towards ancestors and spirits of the natural world, both of which are called &quot;mpungus&quot;. According to the anthropologist Katerina Kerestetzi, a &quot;mpungu&quot; represents &quot;a sort of minor divinity&quot;. Each &quot;mpungu&quot; commonly has its own names and epithets, and may display multiple aspects or manifestations, each with their own specific names. Among the most prominent of these &quot;mpungu&quot;, at least in Havana, are Lucero, Sarabanda, Siete Rayos, Ma&#x27; Kalunga, Mama Chola, Centella Ndoki, and Tiembla Tierra. Others include Nsasi, Madre de Agua, Brazo Fuerte, Lufo Kuyo, Mama canata, Bután, and Baluandé. Each &quot;mpungu&quot; may have its own particular associations; Lucero for instance opens and closes paths while Sarabanda is seen as being strong and wild. The &quot;mpungus&quot; of nature are deemed to live in rivers and the sea, as well as in trees, with uncultivated areas of forest regarded as being especially potent locations of spiritual power. Practitioners are expected to make agreements with these nature spirits.

Particular &quot;mpungus&quot; are often equated with specific &quot;oricha&quot; spirits from Santería, as well as with saints from Catholicism. Sarabanda, for example, is associated with the &quot;oricha&quot; Oggun and with Saint Peter, while Lufo Kuyo is connected to the &quot;oricha&quot; Ochosi and to Saint Norbert. However, &quot;mpungus&quot; play a less important role in Palo than the &quot;oricha&quot; do in Santería. There is also a difference in how the relationship between these entities is established; in Santería it is believed that the &quot;oricha&quot; call people to their worship, pressuring them to do so by inflicting sickness or misfortune, whereas in Palo it is the human practitioner who desires and instigates the relationship with the spirit. In Cuba, Palo is often regarded as being cruder, wilder, and more violent than Santería, with its spirits being fierce and unruly. Those initiates who work with both the &quot;oricha&quot; and the Palo spirits are akin to those practitioners of Haitian Vodou who conduct rituals for both the Rada and Petwo branches of the &quot;lwa&quot; spirits; the &quot;oricha&quot;, like the Rada, are even-tempered, while the Palo spirits, like the Petwo, are more chaotic and unpredictable.

====Spirits of the dead====

The spirits of the dead play a prominent role in Palo, with Kerestetzi observing that one of Palo&#x27;s central features is its belief that &quot;the spirits of the dead mediate and organize human action and rituals.&quot; In Palo, the spirit of a dead person is referred to as a &quot;nfumbe&quot; (or &quot;nfumbi&quot;), a term deriving from the Kikongo word for a deceased individual, &quot;mvumbi&quot;. Alternative terms used for the dead in Palo include the Yoruba term &quot;eggun&quot;, or Spanish words like &quot;el muerto&quot; (&quot;the dead&quot;) or, more rarely, &quot;espíritu&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot;). Practitioners will sometimes refer to themselves, as living persons, as the &quot;walking dead&quot;. In Palo, the dead are often viewed as what Ochoa called &quot;a dense and indistinguishable mass&quot; rather than as discrete individuals, and in this collective sense they are often termed &quot;Kalunga&quot;.

Palo teaches that the individual comprises both a physical body and a spirit termed the &quot;sombra&quot; (&quot;shade&quot;), which are connected via a &quot;cordón de plata&quot; (&quot;silver cord&quot;). This conception reflects a combination of the Bakongo notion of the spirit &quot;shadow&quot; with the Spiritist notion of the &quot;perisperm&quot;, a spirit-vapor surrounding the human body. Once a person dies they are thought to gain additional powers and knowledge such as prescience. They can contact and assist the living, but also cause them problems such as anxiety and sleeplessness.

&quot;Paleros&quot;/&quot;paleras&quot; venerate the souls of their ancestors; when a group feast is held, the ancestors of the house will typically be invoked and their approval to proceed requested. To ascertain the consent of the dead, Palo&#x27;s practitioners will often employ divination or forms of spirit mediumship from Spiritism. Some practitioners claim an innate capacity to sense the presence of spirits of the dead, and initiates are often expected to interact with these spirits and to try and influence them for their own personal benefit. In communicating with the dead, &quot;paleros&quot; and &quot;paleras&quot; are sometimes termed &quot;muerteros&quot; (&quot;mediums of the dead&quot;).

The dead are also believed capable of existing within physical matter. They can for instance be represented by small assemblages of material, often discarded or everyday household objects, which are placed together, typically in the corner of the patio or an outhouse. They are often called a &quot;rinconcito&quot; (&quot;little corner&quot;). Offerings of food and drink are often placed at the &quot;rinconcito&quot; and allowed to decay. This is a practice also maintained by many followers of Santería, although this emphasis placed on the material presence of the dead differs from the Spiritist views of deceased spirits.

===The &quot;Nganga&quot;===

A key role in Palo is played by a spirit-vessel called the &quot;nganga&quot;, a term which in Central Africa referred not to an object but to a man who oversaw religious rituals. This spirit-vessel is also commonly known as the &quot;prenda&quot;, a Spanish term meaning &quot;treasure&quot; or &quot;jewel&quot;. Alternative terms that are sometimes used for it are &quot;el brujo&quot; (the sorcerer), the &quot;caldero&quot; (cauldron), or the &quot;cazuela&quot; (pot), while a small, portable version is termed the &quot;nkuto&quot;. On rare occasions, a practitioner may also refer to the &quot;nganga&quot; as a &quot;nkisi&quot; (plural &quot;minkisi&quot;). The &quot;minkisi&quot; are Bakongo ritual objects believed to possess an indwelling spirit and are the basis of the Palo &quot;nganga&quot; tradition, the latter being a &quot;uniquely Cuban&quot; development.

The &quot;nganga&quot; comprises either a clay pot, gourd, or an iron pot or cauldron. This is often wrapped tightly in heavy chains. Every &quot;nganga&quot; is physically unique, bearing its own individual name; some are deemed male, others female. It is custom that the &quot;nganga&quot; should not stand directly on either a wooden or tile base, and for that reason the area beneath it is often packed with bricks and earth. The &quot;nganga&quot; is kept in a domestic sanctum, the &quot;munanso&quot;, or &quot;cuarto de fundamento&quot;. This may be a cupboard, a room in a practitioner&#x27;s house, or a structure in their backyard. This may be decorated in a way that alludes to the forest, for instance with the remains of animal species that live in forest areas, as the latter are deemed abodes of the spirits. When an individual practices both Palo and Santería, they typically keep the spirit-vessels of the respective traditions separate, in different rooms.

Terms like &quot;nganga&quot; and &quot;prenda&quot; designate not only the physical vessel but also the spirit believed to inhabit it. For many practitioners, the &quot;nganga&quot; is regarded as a material manifestation of a &quot;mpungu&quot; deity. Different &quot;mpungu&quot; will lend different traits to the &quot;nganga&quot;; Sarabanda for instance imbues it with his warrior skills. The &quot;mpungu&quot; involved may dictate the choice of vessel used for the &quot;nganga&quot;, as well as the stone placed in it and the symbol, the &quot;firma&quot;, which is drawn onto it. The name of the &quot;nganga&quot; may refer to the indwelling &quot;mpungu&quot;; an example would be a &quot;nganga&quot; called the &quot;Sarabanda Noche Oscura&quot; because it contains the &quot;mpungu&quot; Sarabanda.
The &quot;nganga&quot; is deemed to be alive; Ochoa commented that, in the view of Palo&#x27;s followers, the &quot;ngangas&quot; are not static objects, but &quot;agents, entities, or actors&quot; with an active role in society. They are believed to express their will to Palo&#x27;s practitioners both through divination and through spirit possession.

Palo revolves around service and submission to the &quot;nganga&quot;. Kerestetzi observed that in Palo, &quot;the &quot;nganga&quot; is not an intermediary of the divine, it is the divine itself [...] It is a god in its own right.&quot; Those who keep &quot;ngangas&quot; are termed the &quot;perros&quot; (dogs) or &quot;criados&quot; (servants) of the spirit-vessel, which in turn is deemed to protect them. The relationship that a Palo practitioner develops with their &quot;nganga&quot; is supposed to be lifelong, and a common notion is that the keeper becomes like their &quot;nganga&quot;. A practitioner may receive their own &quot;nganga&quot; only once they have reached a certain level of seniority in the tradition, and the highest-ranking members may have multiple &quot;ngangas&quot;, some of which they have inherited from their own teachers. Some practitioners will consult a &quot;nganga&quot; to help them make decisions in life, deeming it omniscient. The &quot;nganga&quot; desires its keeper&#x27;s attention; initiates believe that they often become jealous and possessive of their keepers. Ochoa characterised the relationship between the &quot;palero&quot;/&quot;palera&quot; and their &quot;nganga&quot; as a &quot;struggle of wills&quot;, with the Palo practitioner looking upon the &quot;nganga&quot; with &quot;respect based on fear&quot;.

The &quot;nganga&quot; is regarded as the source of a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&#x27;s&quot; supernatural power. Within the religion&#x27;s beliefs, it can both heal and harm, and in the latter capacity is thought capable of causing misfortune, illness, and death. Practitioners believe that the better a &quot;nganga&quot; is cared for, the stronger it is and the better it can protect its keeper, but at the same time the more it is thought capable of dominating its keeper, potentially even killing them. Various stories circulating the Palo community tell of practitioners driven to disastrous accidents, madness, or destitution. Tales of a particular &quot;nganga&quot;&#x27;s rebelliousness and stubbornness contribute to the prestige of its keeper, as it indicates that their &quot;nganga&quot; is powerful.

====&quot;Fundamentos&quot;====

The contents of the &quot;nganga&quot; are termed the &quot;fundamentos&quot;, and are believed to contribute to its power. Sticks, called &quot;palos&quot;, are key ingredients; &quot;palos&quot; are selected from certain species of tree. The choice of tree selected indicates the branch of Palo involved, with the sticks believed to embody the properties and powers of the trees from which they came. Soil may be added from various locations, for instance from a graveyard, hospital, prison, and a market, as may water taken from a river, a well, and the sea. A &quot;matari&quot; stone, representing the specific &quot;mpungu&quot; linked to that &quot;nganga&quot;, may be incorporated. Other material added can include animal remains, feathers, shells, plants, gemstones, coins, razorblades, knives, padlocks, horseshoes, railway spikes, blood, wax, &quot;aguardiente&quot; liquor, wine, quicksilver, and spices. Objects that are precious to the owner, or which have been obtained from far away, may be added, and the harder that these objects are to obtain, the more significant they are often considered to be. This varied selection of material can result in the &quot;nganga&quot; being characterised as a microcosm of the world.

The precise form of the &quot;nganga&quot;, such as its size, can reflect the customs of the different Palo traditions. &quot;Ngangas&quot; in the Briyumba tradition are for instance characterised by a ring of sticks extending beyond their rim. Objects may also be selected for their connection with the indwelling &quot;mpungu&quot;. A &quot;nganga&quot; of Sarabanda for instance may feature many metal objects, reflecting his association with metals and war. As more objects are added over time, typically as offerings, the quantity of material will often spill out from the vessel itself and be arranged around it, sometimes taking up a whole room. The mix of items produces a strong, putrid odour and attracts insects, with Ochoa describing the &quot;ngangas&quot; as being &quot;viscerally intimidating to confront&quot;.

====The &quot;Nfumbe&quot;====

Human bones are also typically included in the &quot;nganga&quot;. Some traditions, like Briyumba, consider this an essential component of the spirit-vessel; other initiates feel that soil or a piece of clothing from a grave may suffice. Practitioners will often claim that their &quot;nganga&quot; contains human remains even if it does not. The most important body part for this purpose is the skull, called the &quot;kiyumba&quot;. The human bones are termed the &quot;nfumbe&quot;, a Palo Kikongo word meaning &quot;dead one&quot;; it characterises both the bones themselves and the dead person they belonged to.

Bones are selected judiciously; the sex of the &quot;nfumbe&quot; is typically chosen to match the gender of the &quot;nganga&quot; it is being incorporated into. According to Palo tradition, an initiate should exhume the bones from a graveyard themselves, although in urban areas this is often impractical and practitioners instead obtain them through black market agreements with the groundskeepers and administrators responsible for maintaining cemeteries. Elsewhere, they may purchase humans remains through &quot;botánicas&quot; or obtain anatomical teaching specimens.

By tradition, a Palo practitioner travels to a graveyard at night. There, they focus on a specific grave and seek to communicate with the spirit of the person buried there, typically through divination. Following negotiations, they create a &quot;trata&quot; (pact) with the spirit, whereby the latter agrees to serve the practitioner in exchange for promises of offerings. Once they believe that they have the spirit&#x27;s consent, the &quot;palero&quot;/&quot;palera&quot; will dig up their bones, or at least collect soil from their grave, and take it home. After being removed from their grave, the bones of the &quot;nfumbe&quot; may undergo attempts to &quot;cool&quot; and settle them, being aspirated with white wine and &quot;aguardiente&quot; and fumigated with cigar smoke. Placing the bones in the spirit-vessel is perceived as sealing the pact between the practitioner and the &quot;nfumbe&quot;. A paper note on which the &quot;nfumbe&quot;&#x27;s name is written may also be added.

Palo teaches that the &quot;nfumbe&quot; spirit then resides in the &quot;nganga&quot;. This becomes the owner&#x27;s slave, making the relationship between the &quot;palero&quot;/&quot;palera&quot; and their &quot;nfumbe&quot; quite different from the reciprocal relationship that the &quot;santero&quot;/&quot;santera&quot; has with their &quot;oricha&quot; in Santería. The keeper of the &quot;nganga&quot; promises to feed the &quot;nfumbe&quot;, for instance with animal blood, rum, and cigars. In turn, the &quot;nfumbe&quot; offers services called &quot;trabajos&quot;, protects its keeper, and carries out their commands. Practitioners will sometimes talk of their &quot;nfumbe&quot; having a distinct personality, displaying traits such as stubbornness or jealousy. The &quot;nfumbe&quot; will rule over other spirits in the &quot;nganga&quot;, including those of plants and animals. Specific animal parts added are believed to enhance the skills of the &quot;nfumbe&quot; in the &quot;nganga&quot;; a bat&#x27;s skeleton for instance might give the &quot;nfumbe&quot; the ability to fly at night, a turtle would give it a ferocious bite, and a dog&#x27;s head would give it a powerful sense of smell.

====&quot;Ngangas cristianas&quot; and &quot;judías&quot;====

The &quot;nganga&quot; generally divide into two categories, the &quot;cristiana&quot; (Christian) and the &quot;judía&quot; (Jewish). The terms &quot;cristiana&quot; and &quot;judía&quot; in this context reflect the influence of 19th-century Spanish Catholic ideas about good and evil, with the word &quot;judía&quot; connoting something being non-Christian rather than being specifically associated with Judaism. &quot;Ngangas cristianas&quot; are deemed &quot;baptised&quot; because holy water from a Catholic church is included as one of their ingredients; they may also include a crucifix. The human remains included in them are also expected to be that of a Christian. While &quot;ngangas cristianas&quot; can be used to counter-strike against attackers, they are prohibited from killing. Conversely, &quot;ngangas judías&quot; are used for &quot;trabajos malignos&quot;, or harmful work, and are capable of murder. Human remains included in &quot;ngangas judías&quot; are typically those of a non-Christian, although not necessarily of a Jew. Sometimes, the bones of a criminal or mad person are deliberately sought. Those observing Palo during the 1990s, including Ochoa and the medical anthropologist Johann Wedel, noted that &quot;ngangas judías&quot; were then rare.

Many practitioners maintain that the two types of &quot;nganga&quot; should be kept separate to stop them fighting. Unlike &quot;ngangas cristianas&quot;, which only receive their keeper&#x27;s blood at the latter&#x27;s initiation, &quot;ngangas judías&quot; are fed their keeper&#x27;s blood more often; they are feared capable of betraying their keeper to drain more of their blood. Palo teaches that although &quot;ngangas judías&quot; are more powerful, they are less effective. This is because &quot;ngangas judías&quot; are scared of the &quot;ngangas cristianas&quot; and thus vulnerable to them on every day of the year except Good Friday. In Christianity, Good Friday marks the day on which Jesus Christ was crucified, and thus &quot;paleros&quot; and &quot;paleras&quot; believe that the powers of &quot;ngangas cristianas&quot; are temporarily nullified, allowing the &quot;ngangas judías&quot; to be used. On Good Friday, a white sheet will often be placed over &quot;ngangas cristianas&quot; to keep them &quot;cool&quot; and protect them during this vulnerable period.

====Creating a &quot;nganga&quot;====

The making of a &quot;nganga&quot; is a complex procedure. It can take several days, with its components occurring at specific times during the day and month. The process of creating a new &quot;nganga&quot; is often kept secret, amid concerns that if a rival Palo practitioner learns the exact ingredients of the particular &quot;nganga&quot;, it will leave the latter vulnerable to supernatural attacks. 

When a new &quot;nganga&quot; is created for a practitioner, it is said to &quot;nacer&quot; (&quot;spring forth&quot; or &quot;be born&quot;) from the &quot;mother&quot; &quot;nganga&quot; which rules the house. Elements may be removed from this parent &quot;nganga&quot; for incorporation into the new creation. The first &quot;nganga&quot; of a tradition, from which all others ultimately stem, is called the &quot;tronco&quot; (&quot;trunk&quot;). The senior practitioner creating the &quot;nganga&quot; may ask a high-ranking initiate to assist them, something considered a great privilege.

The new cauldron or vessel will be washed in &quot;agua ngongoro&quot;, a mix of water and various herbs; the purpose of this is to &quot;cool&quot; the vessel, for the dead are considered &quot;hot&quot;. After this, markings known as &quot;firmas&quot; may be drawn onto the new vessel. During the process of constructing the &quot;nganga&quot;, an experienced Palo practitioner will divine to ensure that everything is going well. Corn husk packets called &quot;masangó&quot; may be added to establish the capacities of that &quot;nganga&quot;. The creator may also add some of their own blood, providing the new &quot;nganga&quot; with an infusion of vital force. Within a day of its creation, Palo custom holds that it must be fed with animal blood. Some practitioners will then bury the &quot;nganga&quot;, either in a cemetery or natural area, before recovering it for use in their rituals.

====Maintaining a &quot;nganga&quot;====

The &quot;nganga&quot; is &quot;fed&quot; with blood from sacrificed male animals, including dogs, pigs, goats, and cockerels. This blood is poured into the &quot;nganga&quot;, over time blackening it. Practitioners believe that the blood maintains the &quot;nganga&#x27;s&quot; power and vitality and ensures ongoing reciprocity with its keeper. 

Human blood is typically only given to the &quot;nganga&quot; when the latter is created, so as to animate it, and later when a neophyte is being initiated, to help seal the pact between them. It is feared that a &quot;nganga&quot; that develops a taste for human blood will continually demand it, ultimately killing its keeper. As well as blood, the &quot;nganga&quot; will be offered food and tobacco, fumigated with cigar smoke and aspirated with cane liquor, often sprayed onto it by mouth.

Initiates follow a specific etiquette when engaging with the &quot;nganga&quot;. They typically wear white, go barefoot, and draw marks on their body to keep them &quot;cool&quot; and protect from the tumult of the dead. Practitioners kneel before the &quot;ngangas&quot; in greeting; they may greet them with the Arabic-derived phrase &quot;Salaam alaakem, malkem salaam.&quot; The &quot;nganga&quot; likes to be addressed in song and each &quot;nganga&quot; has particular songs that &quot;belong&quot; to it. Candles will often be burned while the keeper seeks to work with the vessel. A glass of water may be placed nearby, intended to &quot;cool&quot; the presence of the dead, and to assist their crossing to the human world. Objects like necklaces, small packages, and dolls may be placed around the &quot;nganga&quot; so as to be vitalized with power, allowing them to be used in other rites. To ensure that a &quot;nganga&quot; does its keeper&#x27;s bidding, the latter sometimes threatens it, sometimes insulting it or hitting it with a broom or whip.

When a practitioner dies, their &quot;nganga&quot; may be disassembled if it is believed that the inhabiting &quot;nfumbi&quot; refuses to serve anyone else and wishes to be set free. The &quot;nganga&quot; may then be buried beneath a tree, placed into a river or the sea, or buried with the deceased initiate. Alternatively, Palo teaches that the &quot;nganga&quot; may desire a new keeper, thus being inherited by another practitioner.

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===
Palo teaches deference to teachers, elders, and the dead. According to Ochoa, the religion maintains that &quot;speed, strength, and clever decisiveness&quot; are positive traits for practitioners, while also exulting the values of &quot;revolt, risk and change&quot;. The religion has not adopted the Christian notion of sin, and does not present a particular model of ethical perfection for its practitioners to strive towards. The focus of the practice is thus not perfection, but power. It has been characterised as a world-embracing religion, rather than a world-renouncing one.

Both men and women are allowed to practice Palo. While women can hold the religion&#x27;s most senior positions, most praise houses in Havana are run by men, and an attitude of &quot;machismo&quot; is common among Palo groups. Ochoa thought that Palo could be described as patriarchal, and the scholar of religion Mary Ann Clark encountered many women who deemed the community of practitioners to be too masculinist. Many Palo initiates maintain that women should not be given a &quot;nganga&quot; while they are still capable of menstruating; the religion teaches that a menstruating woman&#x27;s presence would weaken the &quot;nganga&quot; and that the &quot;nganga&#x27;s&quot; thirst for blood would cause the woman to bleed excessively, potentially killing her. For this reason, many female practitioners only receive a &quot;nganga&quot; once they are passed the age of menopause, decades after their male contemporaries. Gay men are often excluded from Palo, and observers have reported high levels of homophobia within the tradition, in contrast to the large numbers of gay men involved in Santería.

==Practices==
Palo is an initiatory religion. Rather than being practised openly, its practices are typically secretive, but revolve around the &quot;nganga&quot;, which is central to its ceremonies, &quot;trabajos&quot; (&quot;works&quot;), and divination. The language used in Palo ceremonies, as in its songs, is often called Palo Kikongo; a &quot;Creole speech&quot; based on both Kikongo and Spanish, it Hispanicizes the spelling of many Kikongo words and gives them new meanings. Practitioners greet one another with the phrase &quot;nsala malekum&quot;. They also acknowledge each other with a special handshake in which their right thumbs are locked together and the palms meet.

===Praise houses===

Palo is organized around autonomous initiatory groups. Each of these groups is called a &quot;munanso congo&quot; (&quot;Kongo House&quot;), or sometimes a &quot;casa templo&quot; (&quot;temple house&quot;). Ochoa rendered this as &quot;praise house&quot;. Their gatherings for ceremonies are supposed to be kept secret. Practitioners sometimes seek to protect the praise house by placing small packets, termed &quot;makutos&quot; (sing. &quot;nkuto&quot;), at each corner of the block around the building; these packets contain dirt from four corners and material from the &quot;nganga&quot;.

&quot;Munanso congo&quot; form &quot;familias de religión&quot; (&quot;religious families&quot;). Each is led by a man or woman regarded as a symbolic parent of their initiates; this senior &quot;palero&quot; is called a &quot;tata nganga&quot; (&quot;father &quot;nganga&quot;&quot;), while the senior &quot;palera&quot; is a &quot;yayi nganga&quot; (&quot;mother &quot;nganga&quot;&quot;). This person must have their own &quot;nganga&quot; and the requisite knowledge of ritual to lead others. This figure is referred to as the &quot;padrino&quot; (&quot;godfather&quot;) or &quot;madrina&quot; (&quot;godmother&quot;) of their initiates; their pupil is the &quot;ahijado&quot; (&quot;godchild&quot;).

A person&#x27;s rank within the house depends on the length of their involvement and the depth of their knowledge about Palo. Below the &quot;tata&quot; and &quot;yayi&quot; are initiates of long-standing, referred to as a &quot;padre nganga&quot; if male and a &quot;madre nganga&quot; if female. The initiation of people to this level is rare. At their initiation ceremony to the level of &quot;padre&quot; or &quot;madre&quot;, a &quot;palero&quot;/&quot;palera&quot; will often be given their own &quot;nganga&quot;. The &quot;tata&quot; or &quot;yayi&quot; may choose not to tell the &quot;padre&quot;/&quot;madre&quot; the contents of the new &quot;nganga&quot; or instructions regarding how to use it, thus ensuring that the teacher maintains control in their relationship with the student.

A &quot;tata&quot; or &quot;yayi&quot; may be reluctant to teach their &quot;padres&quot; and &quot;madres&quot; too much about Palo, fearing that if they do so the student will break from their praise house to establish their own. A &quot;padre&quot; or &quot;madre&quot; will not have initiates of their own. A particular &quot;padre&quot; (but not a &quot;madre&quot;) might be selected as a special assistant of the &quot;tata&quot; or &quot;yayi&quot;; if they serve the former then they are called a &quot;bakofula&quot;, if they serve the latter they are a &quot;mayordomo&quot; (&quot;butler&quot;, &quot;steward&quot;). The &quot;madrinas&quot; and &quot;padrinos&quot; are often considered possessive of their student initiates. Experienced practitioners who run their own praise houses often vie with one another for prospective initiates and will sometimes try to steal members from each other.

An individual seeking initiation into a praise house is usually someone who has previously consulted a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; to request their aid, for instance in the area of health, love, property, or money, or in the fear that they have been bewitched. The Palo practitioner may suggest that the client&#x27;s misfortunes result from their bad relationship with the spirits of the dead, and that this can be improved by receiving initiation into Palo.
New initiates are called &quot;ngueyos&quot;, a term meaning &quot;child&quot; in the Palo Kikongo language. In the Briyumba and Monte traditions, new initiates are also known as &quot;pinos nuevos&quot; (&quot;saplings&quot;). 
&quot;Ngueyos&quot; may attend feasts for the praise house&#x27;s &quot;nganga&quot;, to which they are expected to contribute, and may seek advice from it, but they will not receive their own personal &quot;nganga&quot; nor attend initiation ceremonies for the higher grades. Many practitioners are content to remain at this level and do not pursue further initiation to reach the status of &quot;padre&quot; or &quot;madre&quot;.

When the &quot;tata&quot; or &quot;yayi&quot; of a house is close to death, they are expected to announce a successor, who will then be ritually accepted as the new &quot;tata&quot; or &quot;yayi&quot; by the house members. The new leader may adopt the &quot;nganga&quot; of their predecessor, resulting in them having multiple &quot;nganga&quot; to care for. Alternatively, at a leader&#x27;s death, the senior initiates of the house may leave to join another or establish their own. This results in some Palo practitioners being members of multiple &quot;familias de religion&quot;.

===&quot;Firmas&quot;===

Drawings called &quot;firmas&quot;, their name taken from the Spanish for &quot;signature&quot;, play an important role in Palo ritual. They are alternatively referred to as &quot;tratados&quot; (&quot;pacts&quot; or &quot;deals&quot;). The &quot;firmas&quot; often incorporate lines, arrows, circles, and crosses, as well as skulls, suns, and moons. They allow the &quot;mpungu&quot; to enter the ceremonial space, with a sign corresponding to the &quot;mpungu&quot; that is being invoked drawn at any given ceremony. 

As they facilitate contact between the worlds, the &quot;firmas&quot; are deemed to be &quot;caminos&quot; (&quot;roads&quot;). They also help to establish the will of the living over the dead, directing the action of both the human and spirit participants in a ritual. The &quot;firmas&quot; are akin to the &quot;vèvè&quot; employed in Haitian Vodou and the &quot;anaforuanas&quot; used by Abakuá members.

&quot;Firmas&quot; may derive from the sigils employed in European ceremonial magic traditions. However, some of the designs commonly found in &quot;firmas&quot;, such as that of the sun circling the Earth and of a horizon line dividing the worlds, are probably borrowed from traditional Kongo cosmology. 
There are many different designs; some are specific to the &quot;mpungu&quot; it invokes, others to a particular &quot;munanso congo&quot; or to an individual practitioner. As they are deemed very powerful, knowledge of the &quot;firmas&quot;&#x27; meanings are often kept secret, even from new initiates. Some practitioners have a notebook in which they have drawn the &quot;firmas&quot; that they use, and from which they may teach others.

Before a ceremony, the &quot;firmas&quot; are drawn around the room, including on the floor, on the walls, and on ritual objects. They are often placed at locations suggesting a direction of movement, such as a window or a door. They may also be drawn on handkerchiefs worn by participants on their head or chest. The creation of these drawings is accompanied by chants called &quot;mambos&quot;. Gunpowder piles at specific points of the &quot;firma&quot; may then be lit, with the explosion deemed to attract the &quot;mpungu&quot;. &quot;Firmas&quot; are also cut into the bodies of new initiates, and drawn onto the &quot;nganga&quot; as it is being created.

===Offerings and animal sacrifice===

While offerings to the &quot;nganga&quot; are often given privately, it is also expected that the &quot;nganga&quot; receives sacrifices on its &quot;cumplimiento&quot; (&quot;birthday&quot;), the anniversary of its creation. Sacrifices will similarly often be given on the feast day of the Catholic saint thought to have most in common with the &quot;mpungu&quot; manifested in the &quot;nganga&quot; in question. The &quot;mpungu&quot; spirit Sarabanda is for instance feasted on June 29, the feast day of Saint Peter (San Pedro), who in Cuban tradition is associated with Sarabanda. 

Among the offerings given to the &quot;nganga&quot; are food, &quot;aguardiente&quot;, cigars, candles, flowers, money, but especially blood, which the &quot;nganga&quot; feeds on to grow and gain power. Animal sacrifice is thus a key part of Palo ritual, where it is known by the Spanish language term &quot;matanza&quot; (&quot;slaughter&quot;). The choice of animal to be sacrificed depends on the reason for the offerings. Typically a rooster or two will be killed, but for more important issues a four-legged animal will usually be chosen. The head of the &quot;munanso congo&quot; is typically responsible for determining what sacrifice is appropriate for the situation. Animal blood is deemed very &quot;hot&quot;, although the levels of heat depend on the species in question; human blood is thought &quot;hottest&quot;, followed by that of turtles, sheep, ducks, and goats, while the blood of other birds, such as chickens and pigeons, is &quot;cooler&quot;. Animals deemed to have &quot;hotter&quot; blood are usually killed first. 

Where the killing is to take place, a &quot;firma&quot; will be drawn on the floor. There will often be singing, chanting, and sometimes drumming while the sacrificial animal is brought before the &quot;nganga&quot;; the victim&#x27;s feet may be washed and it is given water to drink. The animal&#x27;s throat will then typically be cut, usually by a senior figure in the &quot;munanso congo&quot;. The blood may be spilled over the &quot;ngangas&quot; and onto the floor. The animal will be butchered, its severed head often placed upon the &quot;nganga&quot;. Several organs will be removed, sautéed, and placed before the &quot;nganga&quot;, where they will often be left to decompose, producing a strong odor and attracting maggots. Other body parts will be prepared for the consumption of the attendees; attempts are often made to ensure that everyone attending the ritual consumes some of the sacrificed flesh. The sacrifice will often be followed by more generalized celebration involving singing, drumming, and dancing.

===Music, dancing, and possession===

Music is an important part of Palo ceremonies, with practitioners putting on performances for the &quot;nganga&quot; that involve singing, drumming and dancing. These will be performed at initiations, feast days, or on occasions when the &quot;nganga&quot; is being asked to do something. The songs employed are typically simpler than those found in Santería, consisting of repeating short melodies. The lyrics often invoke supernatural entities or are focused on making a talisman work. The songs are also antiphonal, with the soloist and chorus alternating, as is common in various African diasporic traditions.

The main style of drum used in Palo is the three-headed &quot;tumbadoras&quot;; this is distinct from the &quot;batá&quot; drum used in Santería. These drums are often played in groups of three. As &quot;tumbadoras&quot; are not always available, Palo&#x27;s adherents sometimes use plywood boxes as drums. Various styles of drumming have been transmitted within Palo, including the &quot;ritmas congos&quot; (&quot;Congo rhythms&quot;) and &quot;influencias bantu&quot; (&quot;Bantu influences&quot;). Each &quot;rama&quot; or Palo tradition also has its own ritual drumming style; the drumming rhythms favored in Mayombe and Briyumba are faster than those in Monte or Kimbisa. While performing, the drummers may vie against one another to display their skills.

The anthropologist Miguel Barnet observed a &quot;striking element of pantomime&quot; in Palo dances, during which dancers will often work themselves into an &quot;absolute frenzy&quot;. A typical dance style used in Palo involves the dancer being slightly bent at the waist, swinging their arms and kicking their legs back at the knee. Another Palo dance style is the &quot;garabato&quot;, in which dancers wield sticks, usually taken from a guava tree, and bang them against each other. Unlike in Santería, dancers at Palo ceremonies do not proceed in a fixed line during the dance. 

In Palo, it is believed that during the dancing, one of the dancers may be possessed by the dead. This individual will be known as the &quot;perro de prenda&quot; (possessed dog); they may drop to the floor at the start of the possession, reflecting a belief that the possessing spirit has come up from the ground. Practitioners believe that the spirit will control the body of the host for a time, during which the possessed person will adopt the traits of this entity. The possessed individual will often give advice, reveal secrets, predict the future, and cleanse attendees of negative influences.

===Initiation and rites of passage===

The initiation ceremony into a Palo praise house is known as a &quot;rayamiento&quot; (&quot;cutting&quot;). The ceremony is usually timed to occur on the night of a waxing moon, performed when the moon reaches its fullest light, due to a belief that the moon&#x27;s potential grows in tandem with that of the dead. It will take place in &quot;el cuarto de religión&quot; (&quot;the room of religion&quot;), sometimes simply known as &quot;el cuarto&quot; (&quot;the room&quot;). The &quot;rayamiento&quot; ceremony involves an animal sacrifice; two cockerels are required, although sometimes additional animals will be killed to feed the &quot;nganga&quot;.

Prior to the initiatory ritual, the initiate will be washed in &quot;agua ngongoro&quot;, water mixed with various herbs, in a procedure called the &quot;limpieza&quot;; this is done to &quot;cool&quot; them. The initiate will then be brought into the ritual space blindfolded and wearing white; trousers may be rolled up to the knees, a towel over the shoulders, and a bandana on the head. The torso and feet are left unclothed. They may be guided to stand atop a &quot;firma&quot; drawn on the floor. They make promises to commit to the &quot;nganga&quot; of the praise house, bringing it offerings at its birthday feasts in return for its protection.

The initiate will then be cut; instruments used have included a razor blade, rooster&#x27;s spur, or &quot;yúa&quot; thorn. Cuttings may be made on the chest, shoulders, back, hands, legs, or tongue. Some of the cuts will be straight lines, others may be crosses or more elaborate designs, forming &quot;firmas&quot;. The cuts are believed to open the initiate up to the spirits of the dead, thus enabling possession. A common belief in Palo is that the dead may possess the initiate at the moment of cutting, and thus it is not thought uncommon if they faint during it. The blood produced is then collected and given to the &quot;nganga&quot;, something practitioners believe enhances the cauldron&#x27;s power to either heal or harm the initiate. Strands of the initiate&#x27;s hair may also be placed in the &quot;nganga&quot;. Parts of the contents of the &quot;nganga&quot; may be rubbed into the initiate&#x27;s wounds, sometimes including bone dust scraped from the &quot;nfumbe&quot;. These wounds will then be packed with candle wax and &quot;chamba&quot;, the latter a mix of powdered human bone, rum, chili, and garlic. The cuts sometimes leave scars. 

Once the cutting has been done, the blindfold will be removed. The new initiate will then head outside to greet the moon before visiting a nearby cemetery. The suffering endured during the initiation rite is regarded as a test to determine if the neophyte has the qualities required of a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot;. New initiates must then learn the correct manner in which to approach the &quot;nganga&quot; and how to perform a sacrifice to it. Students are instructed in Palo through stories, songs, and the recollections of elders; they will also watch their elders and seek to decipher their riddles. 

A practitioner may later experience a second &quot;rayamiento&quot;, enabling them to become a full-ranking initiate of the praise house, a &quot;padre&quot; or &quot;madre&quot;, and thus create their own &quot;nganga&quot;. At an initiate&#x27;s funeral, a rooster may be sacrificed and its blood poured onto the coffin containing the deceased, thus completing the identification of the dead practitioner with the spirits of the dead. As at the initiation, a &quot;firma&quot; will often be painted onto the body.

===Divination===

Palo&#x27;s practitioners communicate with their spirits via divination. The style of divination employed is determined by the nature of the question that the &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; wants answered. Two of the divinatory styles employed are the &quot;ndungui&quot;, which entails divining with pieces of coconut shell, and the &quot;chamalongos&quot;, which uses mollusc shells. Both of these divinatory styles are also employed, albeit with different names, by Santería&#x27;s followers.

&quot;Fula&quot; is a form of divination using gunpowder. It entails small piles of gunpowder being placed over a board or on the floor. A question is asked and then one of the piles is set alight. If all the piles explode simultaneously, that is taken as an affirmative answer to the question. Another form of divination used in Palo is &quot;vititi mensu&quot;. This involves a small mirror placed at the opening of an animal horn decorated with beadwork, the &quot;mpaka&quot;. The mirror is then covered with smoke soot and the &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; interprets meanings from the shapes formed by the soot. The &quot;mpaka&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;eyes of the &quot;nganga&quot;&quot; and is often kept atop the &quot;nganga&quot; itself. Both &quot;fula&quot; and &quot;vititi mensu&quot; are forms of divination that Palo does not share with Santería.

===Healing and hexing===

Palo&#x27;s practitioners often claim their rituals will immediately remedy a problem, and thus clients regularly approach a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; when they want a rapid solution to an issue. The nature of the issue varies; it can involve dealing with state bureaucracy or emigration issues, relationship problems, or because they fear that they are plagued by a harmful spirit. On occasion, a client may request that the Palo initiate kill someone for them using their &quot;nganga&quot;. The fee paid to a Palo practitioner for their services is called a &quot;derecho&quot;. Ochoa noted that &quot;common wisdom&quot; in Cuba held that the fees charged by Palo initiates were less than those charged by Santería practitioners. Indeed, in many cases clients approach Palo practitioners for aid after having already sought help, unsuccessfully, from a Santería initiate.

Practitioners engage in healing through the use of charms, formulas, and spells, often drawing on an advanced knowledge of Cuba&#x27;s plants and herbs. The first steps that a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; will take to assist someone may be a &quot;limpieza&quot; or &quot;despojo&quot; (&quot;clearing&quot;) in which the harmful dead are brushed off from an afflicted person. The &quot;limpieza&quot; will involve a combination of herbs bundled together that are wiped over the body and then burned or buried. Practitioners believe that the effect of these herbs is to &quot;cool&quot; the person to counter the turbulent &quot;heat&quot; of the dead that are around them. The &quot;limpieza&quot; is also employed in Santería.

Another healing procedure involves creating &quot;resguardos&quot;, charms that may incorporate tiny pieces of &quot;nfumbe&quot;, shavings from the &quot;palo&quot; sticks, earth from a grave and anthill, &quot;kimbansa&quot; grass, and animal body parts. These will typically be tied into little bundles and inserted into corn husks before being sewn into cloth packets that can be carried by the afflicted person. Songs will often be sung while creating the &quot;resguardo&quot;, while blood will be offered to vitalise it. The &quot;resguardo&quot; may be placed by the &quot;nganga&quot; for a time to absorb its influence. A Palo practitioner may also turn to the &quot;cambio de vida&quot;, or life switch, whereby the illness of the terminal patient is transmitted to another, usually a non-human animal but sometimes a doll or a human being, thus saving the client.

A concoction or package made for a client may be called a &quot;tratado&quot; (&quot;treaty&quot;) and contain many of the same elements that go into a &quot;nganga&quot;. These packages are deemed to gain their power both from the material included within them and the prayers and songs that were performed while they were being created. This may be placed on the &quot;nganga&quot; to transmit its message to the spirit vessel. Parts of the &quot;nganga&quot; may also be selected and used to create a &quot;guardiero&quot; (&quot;guardian&quot;), a vessel designed for a particular purpose; once that purpose is completed, the &quot;guardiero&quot; may be disassembled and its parts returned to the &quot;nganga&quot;.
If the client&#x27;s problem persists, the &quot;palero&quot;/&quot;palera&quot; will often recommend that the former undergoes an initiation into Palo to secure the protection and assistance of a &quot;nganga&quot;.

====&quot;Bilongos&quot;====

In Cuba, it is widely believed that illness may be caused by a malevolent spirit sent against the sick person by a &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot;. Some Palo practitioners will identify the &quot;muertos oscuros&quot; (&quot;dark dead&quot;), entities that have been sent against an afflicted person by enemies, regarding such entities as hiding in plants, materialised in clothes or furniture, concealed in the walls, or taking animal form. If techniques like the &quot;limpieza&quot; or &quot;resguardos&quot; fail to deal with a client&#x27;s problems, a Palo practitioner will often adopt more aggressive methods to assist the afflicted person. They will use divination to identify who it is that has cursed their client; they may then obtain traces of that alleged perpetrator&#x27;s blood, sweat, or soil that they have walked over, so as to ritually manipulate them.

Palo counter-attacks are termed &quot;bilongos&quot;. Often housed inside a jar or bottle, these concoctions contain soils and powders, as well as dried toads, lizards, insects, spiders, human hair, or fish bones. For the &quot;bilongo&quot; to be effective, practitioners believe, it must be bound in blood to a particular &quot;nganga&quot;. Most &quot;bilongo&quot; will be buried close to the home of their victim, ideally in the latter&#x27;s backyard or close to their front door. In Palo belief, the &quot;bilongo&quot; then draws the &quot;nfumbe&quot; spirit from out of the keeper&#x27;s &quot;nganga&quot; to go and attack the intended victim. The spirit sent to attack may be called a &quot;muerto oscuro&quot; or &quot;enviación&quot;. This may be regarded not as the spirit of a dead individual but rather an entity specifically created for the purpose, a sort of &quot;animate or living automaton&quot;. An attack of this nature is called a &quot;kindiambazo&quot; (&quot;&quot;prenda&quot; hit&quot;) or a &quot;cazuelazo&quot; (&quot;cauldron blow&quot;). This in turn may result in a series of strikes and counter-strikes by different &quot;paleros&quot; or &quot;paleras&quot; acting for different clients. In embracing aggressive counter-attacks against perceived malefactors, Palo differs from Santería.

==History==
===Background===

After the Spanish Empire conquered Cuba, the island&#x27;s Arawak and Ciboney populations dramatically declined. The Spanish then turned to slaves sold at West African ports as a labor source for Cuba&#x27;s sugar, tobacco, and coffee plantations. Slavery was widespread in West Africa, where prisoners of war and certain criminals were enslaved. Between 702,000 and 1 million enslaved Africans were brought to Cuba, the earliest in 1511, although the majority came in the 19th century. In Cuba, slaves were divided into groups termed &quot;naciones&quot; (nations), often based on their port of embarkation rather than their own ethno-cultural background.

Between 1760 and 1790 the largest &quot;nación&quot; in Cuba was the Bakongo, who then comprised over 30 percent of enslaved Africans on the island: at that time they were commonly referred to as &quot;Congos&quot;. Although all largely part of the same linguistic family, these enslaved Bakongo people spoke different languages and were not a uniform group. They came largely from in and around the Kingdom of Kongo, which covered an area encompassing what is now northern Angola, Cabinda, the Republic of Congo, and parts of both Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Many of the enslaved Bakongo people who arrived in Cuba would have brought their traditional religions with them.

Key to many Bakongo traditions were objects containing spirit power, the &quot;minkisi&quot;, from which the Palo &quot;nganga&quot; derives. &quot;Minkisi&quot; could take various forms but were often baskets or bags, with some of the earliest recorded Cuban &quot;ngangas&quot; also being bags. The earliest unambiguous evidence for such a spirit-vessel on Cuba comes from 1875, when a Spanish periodical described an anthropomorphic wooden statue with a cavity in which medicines had been placed. Another account was that provided in the autobiography of the slave Esteban Montejo, who lived during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

When the &quot;nganga&quot; emerged in its current form among Bakongo-descended peoples in Cuba is not known. The sociologist Jualynne E. Dodson suggested a possible link between the iron cauldrons used for &quot;nganga&quot; and those used to process sugar cane on the island. In the period of slavery, the &quot;nganga&quot; would probably have been one of the very few weapons that the enslaved could use against their owners. It is also possible that ritual roles centering around &quot;minkisi&quot; or &quot;nganga&quot; vessels &quot;generated forms of social power&quot; and thus some form of authority among enslaved Afro-Cuban populations.

In Spanish Cuba, Catholicism was the only religion that could be legally practiced. Cuba&#x27;s Catholic Church made efforts to convert the enslaved Africans, but the instruction in Catholicism provided to the latter was typically perfunctory and sporadic. Traditional African rituals might have continued among some of the enslaved people who escaped the plantations to form independent colonies, or &quot;palenques&quot;. Others joined African mutual aid societies, called &quot;cabildos&quot; or &quot;cofradías&quot;, some of which were Bakongo-led and in which traditional rites could also be clandestinely held. Over time, Afro-Cubans of Bakongo ancestry would have lost the ability to speak Kikongo fluently and instead developed a hybrid lexicon combining Spanish with select Kikongo words, the latter often retaining a sense of mystery for their users.

===Formation and early history===

The chronological development of Palo is less clear than that of Santería.
Taking earlier influences and fusing them into a new form, Palo developed as a distinct religion in the late 19th or early 20th century. It may have arisen in Havana, for by the turn of the 20th century it was being transmitted from the Matanzas area in the west of the island to the Oriente Province of the east.

Ochoa described Palo&#x27;s formation as occurring &quot;in conjunction with, or perhaps in response to&quot;, the formation of Santería, a Yoruba-based tradition which emerged in urban parts of western Cuba during the late 19th century. The historian Stephan Palmié commented that Palo showed &quot;considerable influence&quot; from Yoruba-derived religions and argued that, as Santería spread across Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it influenced existing Kongo-derived traditions on the island. Ochoa argued that Santería was nevertheless able to become dominant over Palo because Yoruba understandings of theology were closer to those of Catholicism and could more easily adapt to it. Palo would also take influence from Spiritism, a religion based on the ideas of the French writer Allan Kardec that was of growing interest among the white peasantry, the Creole class, and the small urban middle class of late 19th-century Cuba.

Following the Cuban War of Independence, the island became an independent republic in 1898. In the republic, Afro-Cubans remained largely excluded from economic and political power, and negative stereotypes about them remained pervasive throughout the Euro-Cuban population. Although the republic&#x27;s new constitution enshrined freedom of religion, campaigns were still launched against Afro-Cuban traditions. From the late 19th century, both Palo and Santería houses faced repeated police raids, with this harassment continuing through the middle of the 20th century. The turn of the 20th century saw repeated instances of Afro-Cubans being accused of sacrificing white Christian children to their &quot;ngangas&quot;. In 1904, a trial was held of Afro-Cubans accused of ritually murdering a toddler, Zoyla Díaz, to cure one of their members of sterility; two of the accused were found guilty and executed. References to the case passed down in Palo songs through subsequent generations, with later scholarly assessments suggesting that the accusations relied on &quot;trumped up charges, rumour masquerading as evidence, racism and public hysteria&quot;.

The 1920s saw efforts to incorporate Afro-Cuban elements into a wider understanding of Cuban culture, as in the &quot;Afrocubanismo&quot; literary and artistic movement. These often drew upon Afro-Cuban music, dance, and mythology, but typically rejected African-derived ritual. During the 1940s, the Cuban anthropologist Lydia Cabrera studied Palo; writings by her and other scholars would later interest various initiates, who hoped that studying them could enrich the tradition.

===After the Cuban Revolution===

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 resulted in the island becoming a Marxist–Leninist state governed by Fidel Castro&#x27;s Communist Party of Cuba. Committed to state atheism, Castro&#x27;s government took a negative view of Afro-Cuban religions. However, following the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in the 1990s, Castro&#x27;s administration declared that Cuba was entering a &quot;Special Period&quot; in which new economic measures would be necessary. As part of this, priests of Santería, Ifá, and Palo all took part in government-sponsored tours for foreigners desiring initiation into such traditions. Ochoa noted that Palo &quot;blossomed&quot; amid these liberalising reforms of the mid-1990s.

The decades after the Cuban Revolution saw hundreds of thousands of Cubans emigrate, including Palo practitioners. The 1960s saw Cuban emigres arrive in Venezuela, probably bringing Palo with them, something bolstered by further Cuban arrivals in the early 21st century. In the 2000s, residents reported that many of the graves at Caracas&#x27; Cementerio General del Sur had been pried open to have their contents removed for Palo ceremonies. Palo also appeared in Mexico: in 1989, the Cuban-American narcotrafficker Adolfo Constanzo and his gang were found to have killed at least 14 people on their ranch outside Matamoros, Tamaulipas before placing their victims&#x27; bones in Palo cauldrons. Constanzo&#x27;s group had combined Palo with elements from Mexican religions and a statue of the Mexican folk saint Santa Muerte was found on the property. Much media coverage incorrectly labelled these practices &quot;Satanism&quot;.

Palo also established a presence in the United States. In 1995, the US Fish and Wildlife Service arrested a Palo initiate in Miami, Florida who was in possession of human skulls and exotic animal remains. In Newark, New Jersey in 2002, a Palo practitioner was found with the remains of at least two individuals in his &quot;nganga&quot;. A Palo follower was arrested in 2015 for allegedly stealing bones from mausoleums in Worcester, Massachusetts, while in 2021 two Florida practitioners were arrested for robbing the graves of military veterans. In several parts of the US, archaeologists and forensic anthropologists have frequently encountered &quot;nganga&quot; remains, often referring to them as &quot;Santería skulls&quot;, a term that mistakes Santería for Palo; one example was recovered during the draining of a Massachusetts canal in 2012. The American rapper Azealia Banks has also been public about her practice of Palo Mayombe, discussing it and other African diasporic religions on social media from at least 2016.

==Denominations==
Palo divides into different denominations or traditions called &quot;ramas&quot;, each forming a ritual lineage. The main four are Briyumba, Kimbisa, Mayombe, and Monte; other &quot;ramas&quot; include Musunde, Quirimbya, and Vrillumba. Some practitioners maintain that Mayombe and Monte are the same tradition, whereas elsewhere they have been regarded as separate. Because Palo Monte—the name of which means &quot;sticks of the forest&quot;—was one of the dominant &quot;ramas&quot; in late 20th-century Havana, many academic and popular sources mistakenly adopted the term &quot;Palo Monte&quot; for the whole religion.

Many initiates believe that the names of the &quot;ramas&quot; derive from different ethnic groups from in and around the Kingdom of Kongo. Conversely, Barnet noted that these names cannot be identified with known ethnic groups in Central Africa and that &quot;they may simply be randomly chosen names of Bantu etymology that became adulterated in Cuba&quot;. Palo&#x27;s followers are often critical of rival &quot;ramas&quot;, believing that their own tradition maintains the correct procedure inherited from the past.

Especially syncretic in its approach to Palo is Kimbisa, the &quot;rama&quot; founded in the 19th century by Andrés Facundo Cristo de los Dolores Petit. Petit merged Palo with elements from Santería, Spiritism, and Catholicism, with the tradition operating on the principles of Christian charity. In Kimbisa praise houses, it is common to find images of the Virgin Mary, the saints, the crucifix, and an altar to San Luis Beltrán, the patron saint of the tradition. Unlike other &quot;ramas&quot;, Kimbisa has a supreme leader and a written constitution. Certain members of other Palo traditions look critically upon Kimbisa, believing that it deviates too far from traditional Bakongo practices. The Palo &quot;nganga&quot; has also been incorporated into a Cuban variant of Spiritism, El Espiritismo Cruzao, elsewhere termed Palo Cruzado, or Muertería.

==Demographics==
Palo is found all over Cuba, although it is particularly strong in the island&#x27;s eastern provinces. Describing the situation in the 2000s, Ochoa noted that there were &quot;hundreds if not more&quot; Palo praise houses active in Cuba, and in 2015 Kerestetzi commented that the religion is &quot;widespread&quot; on the island. Although emerging from Bakongo traditions, Palo has also been practiced by Afro-Cubans of other ethnic heritages, as well as by Euro-Cubans, &quot;criollos&quot;, and people outside Cuba. In the United States, for example, Palo has gained popularity among young people in various urban areas.

In Cuba, people are sometimes willing to travel considerable distances to consult with a particular &quot;palero&quot; or &quot;palera&quot; about their problems. People first approach the religion because they seek practical help in resolving their issues, not because they wish to worship its deities. In cases like this, Palo is often favoured over other religions because it claims to provide quicker results, with Palo sometimes deemed more powerful, if less ethical, in its approach than Santería.

==Reception==

In Cuban society, Palo is both valued and feared. Ochoa described a &quot;considerable air of dread&quot; surrounding it in Cuban society, while Kerestetzi noted that Cubans usually regard &quot;paleros&quot; and &quot;paleras&quot; as &quot;dangerous and unscrupulous witches&quot;. This is often linked to the stereotype that &quot;paleros&quot; and &quot;paleras&quot; might kill children for inclusion in their &quot;nganga&quot;; Ochoa noted that in the 1990s he heard Cuban parents warn their children that a &quot;black man with a sack&quot; would carry them off to feed his cauldron. 

Palo has also become associated with criminal practice, in part due to the illegal nature of obtaining buried human remains; in Cuba, a conviction for grave desecration can result in a prison sentence of up to 30 years. 
The existence of Palo has impacted the burial of various individuals in Cuba. Remigio Herrera, the last surviving African-born &quot;babalawo&quot;, or priest of Ifá, was for instance buried in an unidentified grave to prevent &quot;paleros&quot;/&quot;paleras&quot; digging his corpse up for incorporation in their &quot;nganga&quot;.

Palo has also been incorporated in popular culture, as in Leonardo Padura Fuentes&#x27; 2001 novel &quot;&quot;. By the start of the 21st century, various Cuban artists were incorporating Palo imagery into their work; one example was José Bedia Valdés, who received the &quot;mpungu&quot; Sarabanda at his initiation into Palo. In other cases, artists and graphic artists have used Palo &quot;firmas&quot; in their work without being initiates of the religion.

<doc id="1004540" wikidata="Q11892476" url="?curid=1004540" title="Sarah Manners">
<text>Sarah Manners (born 25 August 1975) is an English actress and businessowner, known for her roles as Joanna Helm in the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;, Bex Reynolds in the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; and Kirsty Knight in the ITV procedural drama &quot;The Bill&quot;. Manners competed in the second series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2004, where she finished in sixth place, and has gone on to develop a Pilates app, Pilates On Tap.

==Early and personal life==
Manners was born in Harborne, Birmingham on 25 August 1975. Her father was a classic car dealer, whilst her mother was a headmistress of a school in Handsworth. She was educated at King Edward VI Handsworth, where she obtained 10 GCSEs and four A-levels. She later studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. She married computer salesman Ben O&#x27;Sullivan in 2003 in Lickey, Worcestershire. Manners revealed in an interview that the two had divorced in 2009. She said: &quot;we spent 10 years together and are still close. He&#x27;s a lovely man&quot;.

==Career==
Manners began her career in 1997, appearing in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 2000, Manners was cast in the role of Joanna Helm in the BBC medical soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;. She was one of the original nine regulars cast for the soap. Of her role, she said: &quot;I got the best storylines in the world in &quot;Doctors&quot;, my nan died of a brain tumour then it came out I killed her. I went mad and was addicted to anti-depressants, forged signatures and tried to kill myself&quot;. She later went on to appear as K.C. Gregory in Sky One&#x27;s &quot;Mile High&quot; and Bex Reynolds in the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. In 2004, it was announced that Manners was to participate in the second series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was paired with dancer Brendan Cole and the pair finished in sixth place.

Manners appeared in ITV1&#x27;s &quot;The Bill&quot; as Kirsty Knight. After six months on-screen, it was announced that the show was to be cancelled. Of this, she said: &quot;I’m heartbroken. Not just for myself, but for everyone on the show. It’s a real loss for the industry. Everyone is really upset about it. All the big wigs came down to break the news to us at a meeting. We knew straight away when we saw the look on their faces. But what can you do? C’est la vie! I’ve had a fabulous time and we’re trying to remain positive. We’ve enjoyed every last minute of filming and had a laugh. I&#x27;m proud to be part of the last cast of &quot;The Bill&quot;&quot;. Of her time on the show, she said, &quot;I loved all the action and the stunts on &quot;The Bill&quot;, and the subject matter – it’s a lot more serious than some of the TV I’ve done. In &quot;Casualty&quot; I had a rape storyline, but mainly I’ve been the light relief, so this has been a nice change&quot;. Manners qualified as a Pilates instructor in 2014, and in 2022, she designed and launched a Pilates app, Pilates On Tap. She was named an &quot;Inspirational Woman In Tech&quot; by We Are Tech Women in December 2022.

<doc id="1004541" wikidata="Q5423256" url="?curid=1004541" title="Ezetimibe/simvastatin">
<text>Ezetimibe/simvastatin is a drug combination used for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is a combination of ezetimibe (known as Zetia in the United States) and the statin drug simvastatin (known as Zocor in the US).

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by acting at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.

Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or statin. It works by blocking an enzyme that is necessary for the body to make cholesterol. Generic versions were approved in 2017. The combination preparation is marketed by Merck &amp; Co. under the trade names Vytorin in the US and Inegy in the European Union. In 2018, it was the 349th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800thousand prescriptions.

==Contraindications==
* Acute liver disease
* Pregnancy and breast feeding

==Side effects==
* Myopathy
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Myalgia
* Pain in extremities, abdomen
* Angioedema
* Hepatitis
* Eczema
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Influenza, pharyngitis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection

== Interactions ==

* Cyclosporine
* Danazol
* Protease inhibitors
* Verapamil
* Amiodarone
* Large amounts of niacin (nicotinic acid), grapefruit juice
* Erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin
* Nefazodone

==Pharmacology==
The combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin treats both sources of cholesterol; absorption in the intestine of both biliary and dietary cholesterol, and production in the liver and peripheral tissues. It is thought that the treatment of high cholesterol from both sources is likely to result in lower cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol. In a clinical study, it was shown that the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin was superior to atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol.

==Clinical trials==

===IMPROVE-IT trial===
Published in 2015, the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) randomized 18,144 patients with ACS to simvastatin 40 mg/d plus ezetimibe 10 mg/d or simvastatin alone. With median follow-up of 6 years, simvastatin+ezetimibe was found to reduce the primary outcome of CV mortality, major CV event, or nonfatal stroke (34.7% vs. 32.7%; P=0.016; NNT 50 per 7 years or NNT 350 per 1 year ). There was no reduction in all-cause or CV mortality with simvastatin+ezetimibe, though there was a reduction in MI and stroke.

===ENHANCE trial data===
The two-year ENHANCE Study failed to provide evidence that ezetimibe/simvastatin was better than simvastatin (a generic medication) in terms of achieving a lower change from baseline in carotid intima-media thickness despite lower LDL levels in a population of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a form of high cholesterol that affects less than 1% of patients). Clinical events such as heart attack and stroke were not measured as primary or secondary endpoints of the study making it impossible to determine Vytorin&#x27;s effect on these events. 

===Subsequent debate and enquiries===
The American College of Cardiology released a statement suggesting that &quot;major clinical decisions not be made on the basis of the ENHANCE study alone&quot;, given the small and unique patient population, 720 patients in an Amsterdam hospital with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Merck and Schering Plough have reported that they have three trials underway to focus on outcomes, measuring the drug&#x27;s effect on heart attacks and strokes in patients.

These results were presented in full at the American College of Cardiology meeting on 30 March 2008, two years after the last patient completed the study. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted an inquiry into the delayed disclosure of the study data.

==Advertising campaign==
In the United States, Vytorin featured a television advertising campaign showing a series of split-screen images of a person and a food item to make the point that cholesterol comes from two sources and can be absorbed from food or manufactured by the body, and that heredity plays a role in the latter. This point is a departure from the commonly held belief that high cholesterol only comes from the food that you eat. In each commercial, the person&#x27;s features or clothing and the food plated to emphasize the resemblance between the person and the food. For example, in one advertisement a woman wearing a yellow shirt and a pin is juxtaposed with a similarly colored piece of pie.

<doc id="1004542" wikidata="Q555705" url="?curid=1004542" title="Dejan Stefanović">
<text>Dejan Stefanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Дејан Стефановић; born 28 October 1974) is a Serbian former professional footballer, who is the president of the Slovenian footballers and sportsmen union.

As a player he was a defender who notably played in the Premier League for Sheffield Wednesday, Portsmouth and Fulham. He also played for Red Star Belgrade, Radnički Belgrade and Vitesse. He finished his professional career in 2009 whilst with Norwich City, although he briefly signed for non-league club Havant &amp; Waterlooville a year later.

Stefanovic was capped a combined 23 times by Yugoslavia and successor nation Serbia and Montenegro. He was part of Yugoslavia&#x27;s squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup

==Early life==
While growing up, Stefanović supported Milan and idolized defender Franco Baresi, which inspired him to become a footballer.

==Club career==
===Red Star Belgrade===
Stefanović began his career in his home town with Dinamo Vranje before being signed by Red Star Belgrade. Whilst at the club he made his international debut for FR Yugoslavia, aged 20, against Hong Kong in January 1995.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
During the 1995–96 season, English club Sheffield Wednesday signed Stefanović and his compatriot, striker Darko Kovačević. Stefanović cost the English club £2 million. However, Stefanović struggled to break into the Wednesday side with Emerson Thome and Des Walker among those ahead of him in the pecking order.

In 1998–99, after playing 72 games for the club, Stefanović was released on a free transfer after he failed to make enough first-team appearances to qualify for a work permit extension.

===Vitesse===
In August 1999, Stefanović moved to Dutch club Vitesse, joining three of his compatriots: goalkeeper Dragoslav Jevrić, midfielder Nenad Grozdić, and striker Dejan Čurović. Stefanović spent four years at the club, becoming captain during that time. At Vitesse he played 13 UEFA Cup matches.

===Portsmouth===
At the start of the 2003–04 season, Stefanović returned to England with Premiership newcomers Portsmouth for £1.85 million. He established himself as a first-choice defender during the club&#x27;s first season in the top-flight, and was a regular in the 2004–05 campaign, winning the fans&#x27; Player of the season award. He was made Portsmouth captain by Alain Perrin in the 2005–06 season, although a dip in form and a habit of speaking out to the press earned him the ire of some supporters. Indeed, he confessed to &quot;not giving 100%&quot; under Perrin due to disliking the French coach, comments criticised as highly unprofessional by some fans.

Stefanović&#x27;s influence on chairman (and fellow Serbian) Milan Mandarić is said to have been an important factor in the dismissal of Perrin and the re-appointment of Harry Redknapp, and he was an important member of the side that ensured Premiership survival at Wigan in the penultimate game of the season.

Stefanović was converted to a left-back at the start of 2006–07 and was a mainstay of the defence that performed so well for Portsmouth during the season. However, the arrivals of Hermann Hreiðarsson and Sylvain Distin during the summer of 2007 cast his position as a first team regular into doubt and he was replaced as captain by Sol Campbell for the 2007–08 season.

===Fulham===
In August 2007, Scottish club Rangers revealed an interest in signing Stefanović but he signed for Fulham.

===Norwich City===
Having spent less than a year at Craven Cottage, Stefanović dropped down a division to join Norwich City on 18 July 2008, agreeing a two-year deal.

After twelve starts for the Canaries, during which he picked up one red card, Stefanović ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments and did not play again for Norwich City in the 2008–09 season.

In August 2009, it was reported that Stefanović was in negotiations to leave Norwich, with the player wishing to return to the south of England. On 1 September 2009, his contract was terminated by mutual consent.

===Havant &amp; Waterlooville===
Stefanović retired in late 2009 due to a knee injury. He remained living in the Portsmouth area and on one occasion admitted his dreams of managing Portsmouth one day.

On 7 October 2010 Stefanović joined Havant &amp; Waterlooville.

==International career==
Stefanović is a full Serbia and Montenegro international, earning his first call-up in 1995 (the country was then known as Yugoslavia, changing to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003). He has a total of 20 caps to his name. Stefanović retired from international football in 2004.

==Personal life==
In September 2006, Stefanović caused controversy when he said that he will throw away his Serbian passport as soon as he gets his British passport as he does not feel like a Serb any longer.

He&#x27;s now president of the Slovenian footballers and sportsmen union.

<doc id="1004554" wikidata="Q148628" url="?curid=1004554" title="Nasua">
<text>Nasua is a genus of coatis of the family Procyonidae. Two additional species of coatis, commonly known as mountain coatis, are placed in the genus &quot;Nasuella&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

&quot;Nasua&quot; differs from &quot;Nasuella&quot; in being larger and having larger canine teeth, but preliminary genetic evidence (cytochrome b sequences) suggests that &quot;Nasuella&quot; should be merged into &quot;Nasua&quot;. Other genetic studies have shown that the closest relatives of the coatis are the olingos (genus &quot;Bassaricyon&quot;), from which they diverged about 10.2 million years ago.

== Diet ==

Like other procyonids, coatis are omnivores. Their diet consists largely of insects (including their larvae), spiders and other invertebrates as well as the occasional small vertebrate discovered while energetically foraging, with their sensitive noses to the ground, in forest leaf litter. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, where they have been studied in greatest detail, they supplement this diet with copious amounts of fruit as it becomes available seasonally from favored trees, such as figs (&quot;Ficus insipida&quot;) and hog plums (&quot;Spondias mombin&quot;).

== Behavior ==
Their very active foraging behavior appears to be interrelated with their distinctive social organization. Exceptional among procyonids, coatis are diurnal and for much of the year gregarious. Though females nest, and bear and nurse their young in isolation, shortly after the altricial young become mobile the females aggregate into social groups known as bands. Bands consist of adult females (two or more years old), and sub-adults (1–2 years old) and juveniles (less than 1 year old) of both sexes. At maturity, at two years of age, males are excluded from bands and take up a solitary lifestyle. They are aggressively repelled from bands, except during the mating season when typically one male ingratiates himself to a band through submissive behavior, forages with it for a period of a few weeks, and mates with all of the adult females. During the nesting season, the sub-adults and juveniles remain together in bands while breeding adult females become solitary for parturition and nesting. Females begin breeding in their 3rd or 4th year, apparently depending on nutritional status. Occasionally, older females become postreproductive, and these remain with the bands while breeding females separate. Breeding is synchronous, as is parturition and nursing. Resumption of gregarious behavior takes place synchronously as well, over the course of several weeks, depending on the existence of previous social relationships, i.e. females with prior relationships reaggregate into bands more quickly than those forming new relationships. Nonetheless, persistent social bonds may form anew at this point in the reproductive cycle: while there may be a tendency to reaggregate with kin, prior relationships are not indispensable. Previously unfamiliar individuals may aggregate into bands with stable social relationships. A conspicuous means of bond formation is mutual grooming, on which an hour or more may be spent daily. Some of this appears to be ritualized as a form of social bond formation (Fig. 1), though it is clearly mutually beneficial as well: the burden of ticks on band members is lower than it is on solitary adult males, for instance.

When juveniles descend from the nest, they are little better than helpless. One important benefit of aggregating for the adult females is sharing of vigilance in protection of juveniles from predation. Juvenile mortality is high, sources of peril including adult male coatis which have been observed to kill them. It is not entirely clear whether adult males are preying on them or killing potential rivals, and of course it may be both.

The active foraging behavior of coatis is fairly conspicuous, and requires a considerable degree of attention. The proportion of time that adult females spend foraging increases, and the proportion of foraging time interrupted for stationary vigilance behavior decreases, when aggregation into bands is achieved. Bands forage in formation, with adults and sub-adults distributed around the periphery, and juveniles gathered towards the center. This shared vigilance appears to be an important contributor to the benefit of gregariousness for coatis.

== Species ==

The two species within &quot;Nasua&quot; are:
DNA sequence analysis indicates that the &quot;N. narica&quot; and &quot;N. nasua&quot; lineages split about 5.6 million years ago.

The Cozumel Island coati had been recognized as a third species, but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies, &quot;N. narica nelsoni&quot;, of the white-nosed coati.

<text>Mountain coatis are two species of procyonid mammals from the genus Nasuella. Unlike the larger coatis from the genus &quot;Nasua&quot;, mountain coatis only weigh and are endemic to the north Andean highlands in South America.

==Genetics and taxonomy==
Genetic evidence indicates that the genus &quot;Nasua&quot; is only monophyletic if it also includes the mountain coatis. Based on cytochrome b sequences, &quot;Nasua nasua&quot; is the sister taxon to a clade consisting of &quot;Nasua narica&quot; plus both species of &quot;Nasuella&quot;.

Until recently only a single species with three subspecies was recognized. In 2009 this species was split into two species, the eastern mountain coati (&quot;N. meridensis&quot;) from Venezuela, and the western mountain coati (&quot;N. olivacea&quot;, with subspecies &quot;quitensis&quot;) from Colombia and Ecuador.
After a genetic analysis in 2020, the American Society of Mammalogists currently considers &quot;N. meridensis&quot; a synonym of &quot;N. olivacea&quot;.
==Range and description==
Externally, the two species of mountain coatis are quite similar, but the eastern mountain coati is overall smaller, somewhat shorter-tailed on average, has markedly smaller teeth, a paler olive-brown pelage, and usually a dark mid-dorsal stripe on the back (versus more rufescent or blackish, and usually without a dark mid-dorsal stripe in the western mountain coati). Both are found in cloud forest and páramo; at altitudes of for the eastern mountain coati, and for the western mountain coati.

A population discovered in southern Peru (more than south of the previous distribution limit) has tentatively been identified as the western mountain coati, but may represent an undescribed taxon.

==Rare and little known==
They are very poorly known, and the &quot;combined species&quot; (when only one species was recognized) has been classified as data deficient by the IUCN. Their behavior largely appears to resemble that of the better-known &quot;Nasua&quot; coatis, although the mountain coatis feed less on fruit.

Unlike the &quot;Nasua&quot; coatis, mountain coatis are very rare in captivity. Among ISIS registered institutions, only three zoos (all in the USA) reported that they had mountain coatis in early 2011, but at least one of these appears to be a case of misidentification. A mountain coati that was confiscated from poachers is kept at Bioparque la Reserva in Cota, Colombia.

<text>Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein, born &quot;Franz de Paula Josef Johann Nepomuk Andreas&quot; (19 November 1726 – 18 August 1781), was the Prince of Liechtenstein from 1772 until his death.

== Biography ==
Born in Milan, in what is now northern Italy, he was the son of Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein and Maria Anna Antonia, Countess of Dietrichstein-Weichselstädt, Baroness zu Hollenburg und Finkenstein (10 September 1706 – 7 June 1777). Franz Josef was the eldest of their thirteen children. He was a nephew of Joseph Wenzel I, whom he succeeded on 10 February 1772.

Franz Joseph had been recognised heir to Liechtenstein since 1723, when his uncle&#x27;s only son had died. Joseph Wenzel took Franz Joseph under his wing and Franz Joseph accompanied him in a campaign in Northern Italy, fighting with Wenzel at the Battle of Piacenza. The battle was a victory for the Holy Roman Empire, of which Liechtenstein was a part.

He was the 802nd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria.

In 1763, Franz Josef traveled on behalf of the Emperor to Spain, to bring the bride of Archduke Leopold a picture of the Archduke. In 1767, he became Privy Councillor, and in 1771, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece.

His last public role was to act as president of the Lower Austrian Nobility in 1778.

Once Franz Joseph became Prince of Liechtenstein, he showed great interest in its economic problems and the ever-increasing Liechtenstein art collection. He died in Metz in 1781.

==Marriage and issue==
Franz Josef married Marie Leopoldine Gräfin von Sternberg (Vienna, 11 December 1733 – Feldsberg, 27 June 1809), a member of the Bohemian nobility, on 6 July 1750 in Valtice or Feldsberg. The couple had 8 children: 
* Joseph Franz de Paula Emanuel Philipp Isaias (Vienna, 6 July 1752 – Vienna, 17 February 1754)
* Leopoldina Maria Anna Francisca de Paula Adelgunda (Vienna, 30 January 1754 – Frankfurt, 16 October 1823), married in Felsberg on 1 September 1771 Karl Emanuel, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, and had issue

<doc id="1004572" wikidata="Q7709976" url="?curid=1004572" title="Thami">
<text>The Thangmi (in Nepali थामी) are an indigenous ethnic tribe of Eastern Himalayas. In Nepal, they reside mainly in Suspa, Kshamawati, Khopachagu, Alampu, Bigu, Kalinchok, Lapilang and Lakuri Danda villages of Dolakha district in East-Central Nepal. In India, they reside in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kerseong (West Bengal) and Sikkim (Shniderman, 2009, 2015). Many members of Thami clan are also living in Bhutan. 
They are locally known as Thangmi.

They speak the Thami language or Thangmi Wakhekham, which is a Tibeto-Burman language. The etymological meaning of the word &#x27;Thami&#x27; consists of &#x27;Tha&#x27; (border region) and &#x27;Mi&#x27; (people). Therefore, the word Thami indicates to the people residing in the frontier territory of Nepal (Sheniderman, 2009, 2015; Turin, 1998, 2004)

According to the 2011 Nepal Census, there are a total of 29,000 Thami of which some belong to the Kirat religion, and some belong to Hinduism and Buddhism. Thami ethnic tribe are nature worshipper and follows shamans in their religious-spiritual activities. They have their deities to whom they worship during Udhauli and Ubhauli Pudusa. They worship &#x27;Bara-Dewa&#x27; (the twelve deities), &#x27;Bhumya Dewa&#x27; (Mother Earth), &#x27;Bisai Dewa&#x27;, &#x27;Gosai Dewa&#x27;, &#x27;Chirkun Dewa&#x27; and many others. However, with due course of time Thami indigenous tribe were highly influenced by the popular religion and as a consequence they tend to identify themselves mainly as Hindu and Buddhist. The process of acculturation has threatened their indigenous culture, tradition and belief system. 

Thangmi are socio-economically and politically backward classes. One of the important causes is the exclusion of Thamis from autochthones tribe of Eastern Himalayas and lack of written documents to support the claim that they are aboriginals. Often, they are misrecognized and misrepresented as the sub-clan or caste of other communities and they are not even mentioned in &#x27;Muluk Ain Code&#x27; National Code of Nepal in 1854 (See, Muluk Ain of 1854). They have always remained at the margin, and this forced them to depend on agriculture, hunting, carpentry, manual and unskilled works. This made them economically weak, and poverty became one of the important causes for not obtaining standard of living. Poverty is another reason that excluded them for obtaining basic education. 
==Geographical distribution==
At present, the population of Thami in both India and Nepal are less as compared to all other Nepalese communities. The 2011 Nepal census classifies the Thami within the broader social group of Mountain/Hill Janajati. At the time of the Nepal census of 2011, 28,671 people (0.1% of the population of Nepal) were Thami. The frequency of Thami by province was as follows:
* Bagmati Province (0.5%)
* Gandaki Province (0.0%)
* Karnali Province (0.0%)
* Koshi Province (0.0%)
* Lumbini Province (0.0%)
* Madhesh Province (0.0%)
* Sudurpashchim Province (0.0%)

The frequency of Thami was higher than national average (0.1%) in the following districts:
* Dolakha (9.0%)
* Sindhupalchowk (1.7%)
* Ramechhap (1.0%)
* Ilam (0.3%)
* Sindhuli (0.3%)

<doc id="1004604" wikidata="Q158945" url="?curid=1004604" title="Matthew Taylor (footballer, born 1981)">
<text>Matthew Simon Taylor (born 27 November 1981) is an English former professional footballer, who most notably played for Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers. He is the head coach of club Solihull Moors.

As a player, Taylor was a full-back, wing-back and midfielder in the Premier League for Portsmouth, Bolton Wanderers, West Ham United, and Burnley and in the Football League for Luton Town, Northampton Town and Swindon Town. He scored 84 goals in 658 league games in a 20-year career in English football.

Taylor began his coaching career while still a player at Swindon Town and, upon retiring from playing in 2019, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur to coach their U18s. He landed his first Football League management job in May 2021, taking over as head coach of Walsall. He was dismissed in February 2022 and hired at Shrewsbury Town in League One in June 2023. He was then sacked in January 2024. He was appointed as Wealdstone manager in May 2024.

==Club career==
===Luton Town===
Taylor was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire. He began his career at Second Division Luton Town, making his debut as a 17-year-old at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season. He soon made the left wing-back slot his own and won the Luton Young Player of the Season award in his first ever season as a professional, before he won the Player of the Season award in 2000–01. However, despite having an excellent season, he couldn&#x27;t prevent Luton being relegated to the Third Division. The 2001–02 season saw Luton win promotion as Third Division runners-up, with Taylor scoring 11 league goals and being named in the PFA Third Division Team of the Year.

===Portsmouth===
His displays led to interest from Premier League clubs, but he instead decided, in July 2002, to sign for First Division team Portsmouth for £750,000. The fee was set averting the need for a tribunal, causing Luton manager Joe Kinnear to lament: &quot;at least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask&quot;.

Usually playing as a left wing-back in a 3–5–2 formation, his speedy breaks down the left flank in support of the attack were a feature of Portsmouth&#x27;s play as they won the First Division title in May 2003. As well as being a regular in the team during the season, he also scored seven goals in the League.

An injury picked up in the later stages of the previous season meant that Taylor was unavailable for the start of Portsmouth&#x27;s first Premiership season. After returning to fitness, Taylor struggled to win his place in the side back due to the side&#x27;s good early season form and Harry Redknapp&#x27;s switch to the 4–4–2 formation. Taylor eventually won a place in the Pompey team at left back, where he was a regular in the second half of the 2003–04 season and appeared to be regaining form. Despite failing to score a league goal in his Premiership debut season, Taylor did hit the equaliser in an FA Cup tie at Anfield on 15 February 2004, when he ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with the supporters after a forceful right-footed finish at the Kop End.

Taylor&#x27;s first Premiership goal came against Middlesbrough on 1 February 2005. The summer signing of David Unsworth from Everton meant Taylor only became a regular in the side in the second half of the season.

New manager Alain Perrin utilised Taylor as a left midfielder during the 2005–06 season. On 29 October 2005, he scored from 40 yards at Sunderland&#x27;s Stadium of Light, winning the BBC Goal of the Month. Spotting the goalkeeper Kelvin Davis off his line, Taylor hit a dipping left-footed half-volley over Davis&#x27; head and into the back of the net. Portsmouth had been trailing Sunderland 1–0 in the crucial &quot;six-pointer&quot; but Taylor inspired a second half comeback with two goals and two assists in a 4–1 victory. When Harry Redknapp returned, Taylor initially retained his attacking role but the arrival of Andrés D&#x27;Alessandro on loan and Redknapp&#x27;s disapproval of Perrin&#x27;s left-back, Grégory Vignal, meant that Taylor returned to full-back for the latter stages of the season. In all he played 34 league games, scoring six goals. Two of these were crucial penalties in 2–1 victories; one in the last minute against Sunderland, and another in an away game at Wigan Athletic on 29 April 2006 to secure survival from relegation.

His good form for Portsmouth attracted interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham, but he signed a long-term contract with Portsmouth in July 2006. In the 2006–07 season, Taylor was a regular in the Portsmouth side on the left of midfield. Despite the team&#x27;s good form, it took until early December for him to score his first league goal, in a game against Aston Villa. He then added a second from the penalty spot in the same match before going on to score spectacular volleys in the next two games against Everton and Arsenal.

His first-half goal against Manchester United at Fratton Park in April 2007 sent Portsmouth on their way to a 2–1 victory over the Premier League champions. His final goal for Portsmouth was a penalty kick in August 2007, in a 3–1 win over Bolton Wanderers, the club he moved to five months later.

===Bolton Wanderers===
After losing his place in the Portsmouth team to Niko Kranjčar in the first half of the 2007–08 season, Taylor moved to Bolton Wanderers on 17 January 2008 for an undisclosed fee, after rejecting an offer from Sunderland. On 29 March 2008, Taylor scored his first goals for Bolton with a brace in the 3–2 home defeat to Arsenal. On 11 May 2008, Taylor scored his first away goal for Bolton with a last minute equaliser, gaining Bolton a 1–1 draw against Chelsea on the last day of the 2007–08 Premier League season. In July 2008, having previously worn number 32, Taylor was given the number 7 shirt previously worn by Stelios Giannakopoulos. Taylor scored the 50th goal of his career in a 3–1 win at West Ham United on 5 October 2008 and reached double figures in the league for the first time when scoring against Chelsea on 11 April 2009. In July 2009, he signed a new long-term contract at Bolton Wanderers. In the 2009–10 season, after the Blackburn Rovers game blood tests showed that Taylor had developed glandular fever.

===West Ham United===
On 23 July 2011, Taylor signed for West Ham United for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract. He made his competitive debut on 7 August 2011 in 1–0 home defeat to Cardiff City and scored his first goal in West Ham&#x27;s 4–3 win over his former club, Portsmouth, on 10 September.

===Burnley===
On 4 July 2014, newly promoted Premier League club Burnley confirmed that they had signed Taylor from West Ham United on a two-year deal, on a free transfer. Taylor played in Burnley&#x27;s first three games of the 2014–15 season but sustained an Achilles&#x27; heel injury for which he underwent surgery in October 2014. Taylor returned to the first team on 11 April 2015, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 home defeat to Arsenal. In his third game back, he missed a penalty kick which would have put Burnley 1–0 up in an important game against Leicester City to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Leicester won the game 1–0 scoring 59 seconds after Taylor had missed his penalty.

Taylor was released by Burnley at the end of 2015–16 season after making 37 appearances, scoring four goals.

===Northampton Town===
On 1 August 2016, Taylor signed for newly promoted League One club Northampton Town on a one-year contract. He debuted on the opening day of 2016–17 in a 1–1 draw at home to Fleetwood Town. His first goal for Northampton came from a 20-yard free kick in a 3–2 victory at home to Milton Keynes Dons on 4 September, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 2–0 win at home to Walsall. Taylor finished the season with 48 appearances and eight goals, and signed a one-year contract extension after a clause in his contract was triggered.

===Swindon Town===
On 22 August 2017, Taylor signed for League Two club Swindon Town on a one-year contract. Four days later, Taylor made his debut during Swindon&#x27;s 3–0 home defeat against Crawley Town, replacing Amine Linganzi in the 53rd minute. On 22 September 2017, Taylor scored his first goal for Swindon in their 2–0 away victory over newly promoted Forest Green Rovers, doubling the visitors lead in the 91st minute.

On 6 June 2018, Taylor signed a new one-year deal with Swindon, agreeing to continue his player/coach role. In March 2019, Taylor announced his intention to retire from football at the end of the 2018–19 season.

==Coaching career==
===Early years===
Taylor completed his coaching badges during his playing career and spent time working alongside Luton Town&#x27;s under-15 and under-16 teams while at West Ham United.

Taylor was named interim manager at Swindon Town when David Flitcroft left for promotion rivals Mansfield Town on 1 March 2018. His sole game in charge on 9 March was a 3–0 home loss to Cheltenham Town. He transitioned into a player-coach role following the appointment of Phil Brown as manager.

Taylor was appointed head coach of Tottenham Hotspur Under-18s upon his retirement from football in 2019.

===Walsall===
On 19 May 2021, Taylor was appointed at League Two club Walsall, succeeding Brian Dutton at the turn of the month. After losing 1–0 on his debut at Tranmere Rovers on 7 August, he gained his first win by the same score at home to Stevenage on the fifth matchday, three weeks later. The Saddlers went unbeaten in October, winning and drawing an equal share of their six games; this earned Taylor a nomination for EFL League Two Manager of the Month, alongside the Exeter City manager of the same name.

Taylor was relieved of his duties at the club on 9 February 2022. The club had been approaching a play-off place before the turn of the year, but seven consecutive defeats left them four points above the relegation zone.

===Shrewsbury Town===
On 26 June 2023, Taylor was appointed head coach of League One club Shrewsbury Town on a contract of undisclosed length. He was their first appointee to bear the title head coach instead of manager, due to the creation of a director of football role for Micky Moore. Taylor, alongside assistant head coach Marcus Bignot, was relieved of his duties on 21 January 2024 after a poor run of seven defeats in eight games.

===Wealdstone===
On 10 May 2024, Taylor was appointed as First Team Manager of National League club Wealdstone.

===Solihull Moors===
On 23 January 2025, Taylor was appointed head coach of fellow National League side Solihull Moors.

<text>Rudolph Chambers Lehmann (3 January 1856 – 22 January 1929) was an English writer and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1906 to 1910. As a writer he was best known for three decades in which he was a major contributor to &quot;Punch&quot; as well as founding editor of &quot;Granta&quot; magazine.

==Life and career==
Lehmann was born in Ecclesall near Sheffield. His father was Augustus Frederick Lehmann, a merchant and steel manufacturer whose brothers Henri and Rudolf were both noted academic artists. His mother, Nina Chambers, was the daughter of the Scottish author and naturalist Robert Chambers. Their social circle included Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Robert Browning, Lord Leighton and other prominent figures.

Lehmann attended Highgate School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was president of the Cambridge Union Society in 1876. He was also a rower, and captained the First Trinity Boat Club, although in the trial eights for two years, he did not quite make the Cambridge eight. At Henley Royal Regatta he finished last in every heat he entered, from the 1877 Visitors’ to the 1888 Wyfolds.

Lehmann was admitted at the Inner Temple on 6 November 1875 and called to the bar on 21 April 1880. He served on the South Eastern Circuit.

In April 1889, Lehmann began editing the Cambridge undergraduates&#x27; magazine &quot;Granta&quot; and his first contribution to &quot;Punch&quot; appeared in the 14 December 1889 issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, a dialogue with the title &quot;Among the Amateurs&quot;. More pieces appeared in Punch, such as the series titled &quot;Modern Types&quot;, and parodies of well-known contemporary authors under the title of &quot;Mr Punch&#x27;s Prize Novels&quot;, and within four months he had been appointed as one of the editorial staff and regular contributors, his writings for &quot;Punch&quot; stretching over thirty years, from 1889 to 1919. He wrote perhaps the first series of Sherlock Holmes parodies in &quot;Punch&quot; from August until early November 1894; they were collected in 1901 as a book entitled &quot;The Adventures of Picklock Holes.&quot;

From 1891 to 1903 Lehmann coached Oxford and Cambridge, generally as a finishing coach for one or the other but in 1892 for both. He also coached at various times Leander, Harvard, Brasenose College Boat Club, Trinity College Dublin, and the Berlin Rowing Club. &quot;It was characteristic of him that he gave his valued services to two countries, three universities, and several colleges besides his own&quot;. He was Hon. Sec. of the Amateur Rowing Association from 1893 to 1901 and captain of the Leander Club in 1894 and 1895. He was considered an authority on rowing, about which he wrote a book, &quot;The Complete Oarsman&quot;, and was the main contributor to &quot;Rowing&quot; (1898) in The Isthmian Library series.

Lehmann also wrote verse, mostly light and was described as the &quot;Poet Laureate of Rowing&quot;. He tried his hand as a lyricist in such works as &quot;His Majesty&quot;, a comic opera in the Gilbert and Sullivan vein, with music by Alexander Mackenzie, a libretto by F. C. Burnand and additional lyrics by Adrian Ross, presented at the Savoy Theatre in 1897. He was appointed as editor of the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1901 following the resignation of Sir John Richard Robinson.

In 1906 Lehmann was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Harborough which he held until 1910.

He was sketched in &quot;A History of Punch&quot; by R.G.G. Price as indolent, but able to rouse to write a short piece, and as having given some of that character to the rest of the staff. Other books derived from &quot;Punch&quot; writing, i.e. &quot;The Vagabond and Other Poems from Punch&quot;.

Lehmann lived with his family at Bourne End, Buckinghamshire in a large house called Fieldhead. He was a JP for the county. He was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1901.

Lehmann died in High Wycombe in 1929, aged 73. Married to an American, Alice Marie Davis (1873–1956), his children were Helen Lehmann (1899–1985), the novelist Rosamond Lehmann (1901–1990), the actress Beatrix Lehmann (1903–1979) and the writer and publisher John Lehmann (1907–1987).

<text>Wilhelm August Rudolf Lehmann (19 August 1819, near Hamburg – 27 October 1905, in Bushey) was a German-born British portraitist and author. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1866.

==Life==

Lehmann was born in Ottensen (now part of Hamburg) in the Duchy of Holstein, the son of painter Leo Lehmann. The Lehmann family was Jewish. 
He and his elder brother Henri Lehmann studied in Paris at the École des Beaux-arts, in Rome, and with the painters Peter von Cornelius and Wilhelm von Kaulbach. 
Lehmann&#x27;s major painting, &quot;The Blessing of the Pontine Marshes by Sixtus V&quot; was shown in Paris in 1846 and bought by the French government.

In 1866 Lehmann settled in London, became a British citizen, and painted his best-known portraits.

He married Amelia Chambers, daughter of the Scot author and naturalist Robert Chambers. 
Amelia&#x27;s sister Nina married Lehmann&#x27;s younger brother Frederick, and the extended social circle of the two couples included Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Robert Browning, Lord Leighton, and other prominent figures. 
In 1896, a number of his engraved portraits were collected and published as &quot;Men and Women of the Century&quot;. Lehmann&#x27;s memoir was published in 1894 as &quot;An Artist&#x27;s Reminiscences&quot;.

He died at his home, Boumemede, Bushey, on 27 October 1905 and was buried in the east side of Highgate Cemetery. His daughter, Liza was later buried with him.

==Family==
One of Lehmann&#x27;s daughters was Liza Lehmann, who became a notable English soprano and composer. Lehmann was the uncle of the British journalist and politician Rudolf Chambers Lehmann.

<doc id="1004621" wikidata="Q1405527" url="?curid=1004621" title="B of the Bang">
<text>B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas Heatherwick next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, United Kingdom, which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games; at it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of &quot;Aspire&quot; in 2008. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie, in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &quot;bang&quot; of the starting pistol, but at &quot;the B of the Bang&quot;.

The sculpture was commissioned in 2003; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action to repair the sculpture was started by Manchester City Council a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7 million.

In February 2009, Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in July 2012, with the 180 spikes reported to have been placed in storage for an undecided future use.

== Design and statistics==
&quot;B of the Bang&quot; originally stood tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core. It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five long, tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes above the ground. The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes, with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1,000 tonnes, including a reinforced concrete slab. The foundations were deep.

The sculpture was made from the same weathering steel (also known as Cor-Ten) as the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; sculpture, which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water. As part of the design, the spikes swayed slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of . At the time of construction, a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture, containing children&#x27;s poems and paintings, due to be opened circa 2300. The location of the time capsule after dismantling is currently unknown.

&quot;B of the Bang&quot; was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road. It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &#x27;bang&#x27; of the starting pistol, but at &#x27;The B of the Bang&#x27;. The artwork had been nicknamed &quot;KerPlunk&quot; by the locals after the popular children&#x27;s game from the 1970s.

Prior to the construction of &quot;Aspire&quot; at the University of Nottingham, &quot;B of the Bang&quot; was Britain&#x27;s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;, which stands at . It was designed to look like an exploding firework and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.

== Construction and funding==

The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved at the start of 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname &quot;G of the Bang&quot;.

The official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005.

In total the sculpture cost £1.42 million to design and construct – twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing £500,000, and Manchester City Council providing £120,000.

== Structural problems and legal action ==

The tip of one of the spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned.

Four months later, in May 2005, a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes&#x27; weights.

Despite these modifications, &quot;B of the Bang&quot; remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to &#x27;Get It Sorted&#x27;. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.

Weld defects were identified within the sculpture, which cracked when wind blew through it. Weights affixed to the tips to reduce vibrations did not solve the problem. Replacing the spikes with heavier steel was proposed, at a cost of £3.5 million, with a reduction of the size of the spikes that the council described as &quot;unacceptable on aesthetic grounds&quot;. Another option would have been to replace the spikes with carbon/glass fibre composite, which would have cost around £3 million.

It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008, this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project&#x27;s designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.

==Dismantling==

Acting on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that &quot;B of the Bang&quot; should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture&#x27;s aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.

In January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;—to which &quot;B of the Bang&quot; is often compared—spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, &quot;It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council&#x27;s nerve.&quot;

Despite Gormley&#x27;s plea, removal of &quot;B of the Bang&quot; began in April 2009. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment.

Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture&#x27;s return, and in early July 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £17,000. The spikes were reported to be in storage in a secret location in 2018.

<doc id="1004626" wikidata="Q5736700" url="?curid=1004626" title="Old Japanese">
<text>is the oldest attested stage of the Japanese language, recorded in documents from the Nara period (8th century). It became Early Middle Japanese in the succeeding Heian period, but the precise delimitation of the stages is controversial.
Old Japanese was an early member of the Japonic language family. No genetic links to other language families have been proven.

Old Japanese was written using man&#x27;yōgana, using Chinese characters as syllabograms or (occasionally) logograms. It featured a few phonemic differences from later forms, such as a simpler syllable structure and distinctions between several pairs of syllables that have been pronounced identically since Early Middle Japanese. The phonetic realization of these distinctions is uncertain. Internal reconstruction points to a pre-Old Japanese phase with fewer consonants and vowels.

As is typical of Japonic languages, Old Japanese was primarily an agglutinative language with a subject–object–verb word order, adjectives and adverbs preceding the nouns and verbs they modified and auxiliary verbs and particles appended to the main verb. Unlike in later periods, Old Japanese adjectives could be used uninflected to modify following nouns. Old Japanese verbs had a rich system of tense and aspect suffixes.

==Sources and dating==

Old Japanese is usually defined as the language of the Nara period (710–794), when the capital was Heijō-kyō (now Nara).
That is the period of the earliest connected texts in Japanese, the 112 songs included in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (712).
The other major literary sources of the period are the 128 songs included in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (720) and the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; (), a compilation of over 4,500 poems.
Shorter samples are 25 poems in the &quot;Fudoki&quot; (720) and the 21 poems of the &quot;Bussokuseki-kahi&quot; ().
The latter has the virtue of being an original inscription, whereas the oldest surviving manuscripts of all the other texts are the results of centuries of copying, with the attendant risk of scribal errors.
Prose texts are more limited but are thought to reflect the syntax of Old Japanese more accurately than verse texts do. The most important are the 27 (&#x27;liturgies&#x27;) recorded in the &quot;Engishiki&quot; (compiled in 927) and the 62 (literally &#x27;announced order&#x27;, meaning imperial edicts) recorded in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (797).

A limited number of Japanese words, mostly personal names and place names, are recorded phonetically in ancient Chinese texts, such as the &quot;Wei Zhi&quot; portion of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (3rd century AD), but the transcriptions by Chinese scholars are unreliable.
The oldest surviving inscriptions from Japan, dating from the 5th or early 6th centuries, include those on the Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror, the Inariyama Sword, and the Eta Funayama Sword.
Those inscriptions are written in Classical Chinese but contain several Japanese names that were transcribed phonetically using Chinese characters.
Such inscriptions became more common from the Suiko period (592–628).
Those fragments are usually considered a form of Old Japanese.

Of the 10,000 paper records kept at Shōsōin, only two, dating from about 762, are in Old Japanese.
Over 150,000 wooden tablets () dating from the late 7th and early 8th century have been unearthed.
The tablets bear short texts, often in Old Japanese of a more colloquial style than the polished poems and liturgies of the primary corpus.

==Writing system==

Artifacts inscribed with Chinese characters dated as early as the 1st century AD have been found in Japan, but detailed knowledge of the script seems not to have reached the islands until the early 5th century.
According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the script was brought by scholars from Baekje (southwestern Korea).
The earliest texts found in Japan were written in Classical Chinese, probably by immigrant scribes.
Later &quot;hybrid&quot; texts show the influence of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, the verb being placed after the object).

Chinese and Koreans had long used Chinese characters to write non-Chinese terms and proper names phonetically by selecting characters for Chinese words that sounded similar to each syllable.
Koreans also used the characters phonetically to write Korean particles and inflections that were added to Chinese texts to allow them to be read as Korean (Idu script).
In Japan, the practice was developed into , a complete script for the language that used Chinese characters phonetically, which was the ancestor of modern kana syllabaries.
This system was already in use in the verse parts of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (712) and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (720).

For example, the first line of the first poem in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; was written with five characters:

This method of writing Japanese syllables by using characters for their Chinese sounds () was supplemented with indirect methods in the complex mixed script of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; ().

===Syllables===
In , each Old Japanese syllable was represented by a Chinese character. Although any of several characters could be used for a given syllable, a careful analysis reveals that 88 syllables were distinguished in early Old Japanese, typified by the &quot;Kojiki&quot; songs:

As in later forms of Japanese, the system has gaps where &quot;yi&quot; and &quot;wu&quot; might be expected. Shinkichi Hashimoto discovered in 1917 that many syllables that have a modern &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot; occurred in two forms, termed types and .
These are denoted by subscripts 1 and 2 respectively in the above table. The syllables &quot;mo1&quot; and &quot;mo2&quot; are not distinguished in the slightly later &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, reducing the syllable count to 87.
Some authors also believe that two forms of &quot;po&quot; were distinguished in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.
All of these pairs had merged in the Early Middle Japanese of the Heian period.

The consonants &quot;g&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot; did not occur at the start of a word.
Conversely, syllables consisting of a single vowel were restricted to word-initial position, with a few exceptions such as &#x27;oar&#x27;, &#x27;to lie down&#x27;, &#x27;to regret&#x27; (with conclusive ), &#x27;to age&#x27; and , the adnominal form of the verb &#x27;to plant&#x27;. Alexander Vovin argues that the non-initial syllables &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in these cases should be read as Old Japanese syllables &quot;yi&quot; and &quot;wu&quot;.

The rare vowel almost always occurred at the end of a morpheme.
Most occurrences of , and were also at the end of a morpheme.

The typically did not distinguish voiced from voiceless consonants, and wrote some syllables with characters that had fewer strokes and were based on older Chinese pronunciations imported via the Korean peninsula.
For example,
* was written with the character , pronounced * in Old Chinese and in Middle Chinese, and
* was written with the character , pronounced * in Old Chinese and in Middle Chinese.

=== Transcription ===
Several different notations for the type A/B distinction are found in the literature, including:
==Phonology==
There is no consensus on the pronunciation of the syllables distinguished by .
One difficulty is that the Middle Chinese pronunciations of the characters used are also disputed, and since the reconstruction of their phonetic values is partly based on later Sino-Japanese pronunciations, there is a danger of circular reasoning.
Additional evidence has been drawn from phonological typology, subsequent developments in the Japanese pronunciation, and the comparative study of the Ryukyuan languages.

===Consonants===
Miyake reconstructed the following consonant inventory:

The voiceless obstruents had voiced prenasalized counterparts .
Prenasalization was still present in the late 17th century (according to the Korean textbook &quot;Ch&#x27;ŏphae Sinŏ&quot;) and is found in some Modern Japanese and Ryukyuan dialects, but it has disappeared in modern Japanese except for the intervocalic nasal stop allophone of .
The sibilants and may have been palatalized before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.

Comparative evidence from Ryukyuan languages suggests that Old Japanese &quot;p&quot; reflected an earlier voiceless bilabial stop *p.
There is general agreement that word-initial &quot;p&quot; had become a voiceless bilabial fricative by Early Modern Japanese, as suggested by its transcription as &quot;f&quot; in later Portuguese works and as &quot;ph&quot; or &quot;hw&quot; in the Korean textbook &quot;Ch&#x27;ŏphae Sinŏ&quot;. In Modern Standard Japanese, it is romanized as &quot;h&quot; and has different allophones before various vowels. In medial position, it became in Early Middle Japanese and has since disappeared except before &quot;a&quot;.
Many scholars, following Shinkichi Hashimoto, argue that &quot;p&quot; had already lenited to by the Old Japanese period, but Miyake argues that it was still a stop.

===Vowels===
The Chinese characters chosen to write syllables with the Old Japanese vowel &quot;a&quot; suggest that it was an open unrounded vowel .
The vowel &quot;u&quot; was a close back rounded vowel , unlike the unrounded of Modern Standard Japanese.

Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the A/B distinctions made in . The issue is hotly debated, and there is no consensus. The traditional view, first advanced by Kyōsuke Kindaichi in 1938, is that there were eight pure vowels, with the type B vowels being more central than their type A counterparts. Others, beginning in the 1930s but more commonly since the work of Roland Lange in 1968, have attributed the type A/B distinction to medial or final glides and . The diphthong proposals are often connected to hypotheses about pre-Old Japanese, but all exhibit an uneven distribution of glides.

The distinction between &quot;mo1&quot; and &quot;mo2&quot; was seen only in &quot;Kojiki&quot; and vanished afterwards.
The distribution of syllables suggests that there may have once been *&quot;po1&quot;, *&quot;po2&quot;, *&quot;bo1&quot; and *&quot;bo2&quot;.
If that was true, a distinction was made between &quot;Co1&quot; and &quot;Co2&quot; for all consonants C except for &quot;w&quot;. Some take that as evidence that &quot;Co1&quot; may have represented &quot;Cwo&quot;.

===Accent===
Although modern Japanese dialects have pitch accent systems, they were usually not shown in . However, in one part of the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the Chinese characters appeared to have been chosen to represent a pitch pattern similar to that recorded in the &quot;Ruiju Myōgishō&quot;, a dictionary that was compiled in the late 11th century. In that section, a low-pitch syllable was represented by a character with the Middle Chinese level tone, and a high pitch was represented by a character with one of the other three Middle Chinese tones.
(A similar division was used in the tone patterns of Chinese poetry, which were emulated by Japanese poets in the late Asuka period.)
Thus, it appears that the Old Japanese accent system was similar to that of Early Middle Japanese.

===Phonotactics===
Old Japanese words consisted of one or more open syllables of the form (C)V, subject to additional restrictions:
* Words did not begin with &quot;r&quot; or the voiced obstruents &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, and &quot;g&quot;, with the exception of a few loanwords.
* A bare vowel did not occur except for word-initially: vowel sequences were not permitted.

In 1934, Arisaka Hideyo proposed a set of phonological restrictions permitted in a single morpheme. Arisaka&#x27;s Law states that &quot;-o2&quot; was generally not found in the same morpheme as &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-o1&quot; or &quot;-u&quot;.
Some scholars have interpreted that as a vestige of earlier vowel harmony, but it is very different from patterns that are observed in, for example, the Turkic languages.

===Morphophonemics===
Two adjacent vowels fused to form a new vowel when a consonant was lost within a morpheme, or a compound was lexicalized as a single morpheme.
The following fusions occurred:

;&quot;i1&quot; + &quot;a&quot; → &quot;e1&quot;
:* &#x27;bloom&#x27; + &#x27;exist&#x27; → &#x27;be blooming&#x27;
:* &#x27;wear&#x27; + &#x27;be.&#x27; → &#x27;wear.&#x27;
:Further examples are provided by verbs ending with the retrospective auxiliary - and the verbal suffixes &#x27;conjecture&#x27; or &#x27;exist&#x27;:
:* + → &#x27;(it) has surely fallen&#x27;
:* &#x27;exist..&#x27; + → &#x27;it existed&#x27;
;&quot;i1&quot; + &quot;o2&quot; → &quot;e1&quot;
:* &#x27;real&#x27; + &#x27;person&#x27; → &#x27;living person&#x27;
;&quot;a&quot; + &quot;i&quot; → &quot;e2&quot;
:* &#x27;long&#x27; + &#x27;breath&#x27; → &#x27;sigh&#x27;
:* &#x27;high&#x27; + &#x27;market&#x27; → (place name)
;&quot;o2&quot; + &quot;i&quot; → &quot;e2&quot;
:* &#x27;palace&#x27; + &#x27;enter&#x27; → &#x27;attendant&#x27;
;&quot;o2&quot; + &quot;i&quot; → &quot;i2&quot;
:* &#x27;big&#x27; + &#x27;rock&#x27; → &#x27;big rock&#x27;
;&quot;u&quot; + &quot;i&quot; → &quot;i2&quot;
:* &#x27;young&#x27; + &#x27;term of veneration (male)&#x27; → (title)
;&quot;u&quot; + &quot;a&quot; → &quot;o1&quot;
:* &#x27;number&#x27; + &#x27;to join&#x27; → &#x27;to count&#x27;
;&quot;u&quot; + &quot;o&quot; → &quot;o1&quot;
:* &#x27;ancient type of native weaving&#x27; + &#x27;weaving&#x27; → &#x27;native weaving&#x27;

Adjacent vowels belonging to different morphemes, or pairs of vowels for which none of the above fusions applied, were reduced by deleting one or other of the vowels.
Most often, the first of the adjacent vowels was deleted:
* &#x27;eternal&#x27; + &#x27;rock&#x27; → &#x27;eternal rock; everlasting&#x27;
* &#x27;heaven&#x27; + &#x27;descend&#x27; → &#x27;descend from heaven&#x27;
The exception to this rule occurred when the first of the adjacent vowels was the sole vowel of a monosyllabic morpheme (usually a clitic), in which case the other vowel was deleted:
* (honorific) + &#x27;horse&#x27; → &#x27;honourable horse&#x27;
* &#x27;child, egg&#x27; + &#x27;birth&#x27; → &#x27;give birth, lay an egg&#x27;
Cases where both outcomes are found are attributed to different analyses of morpheme boundaries:
* &#x27;my&#x27; + &#x27;house&#x27; → &#x27;my house&#x27;
* &#x27;I&#x27; + + &#x27;house&#x27; → &#x27;my house&#x27;

=== Pre-Old Japanese ===
Internal reconstruction suggests that the stage preceding Old Japanese had fewer consonants and vowels.

==== Consonants ====
Internal reconstruction suggests that the Old Japanese voiced obstruents, which always occurred in medial position, arose from the weakening of earlier nasal syllables before voiceless obstruents:
* &quot;b&quot; &lt; *-mVp-, *-nVp-: e.g. &#x27;net&#x27; + &#x27;pull&#x27; → &#x27;trawling&#x27;
* &quot;d&quot; &lt; *-mVt-, *-nVt-: e.g. &#x27;mountain&#x27; + &#x27;path&#x27; → &#x27;mountain path&#x27;
* &quot;z&quot; &lt; *-mVs-, *-nVs-: e.g. &#x27;village&#x27; + &#x27;master&#x27; → (title)
* &quot;g&quot; &lt; *-mVk-, *-nVk-
In some cases, such as &#x27;grain&#x27;, &#x27;rudder&#x27; and &#x27;knee&#x27;, there is no evidence for a preceding vowel, which leads some scholars to posit final nasals at the earlier stage.

Some linguists suggest that Old Japanese &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; derive, respectively, from *b and *d at some point before the oldest inscriptions in the 6th century. Southern Ryukyuan varieties such as Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni have corresponding to Old Japanese &quot;w&quot;, but only Yonaguni (at the far end of the chain) has where Old Japanese has &quot;y&quot;:
* &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;stomach&#x27; corresponding to Old Japanese and 
* Yonaguni &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;hot water&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27; corresponding to Old Japanese , and 
However, many linguists, especially in Japan, argue that the Southern Ryukyuan voiced stops are local innovations, adducing a variety of reasons.

Some supporters of *b and *d also add *z and *g, which both disappeared in Old Japanese, for reasons of symmetry.
However, there is very little Japonic evidence for them.

==== Vowels ====
As seen in , many occurrences of the rare vowels &quot;i2&quot;, &quot;e1&quot;, &quot;e2&quot; and &quot;o1&quot; arise from fusion of more common vowels.
Similarly, many nouns having independent forms ending in &quot;-i2&quot; or &quot;-e2&quot; also have bound forms ending in a different vowel, which are believed to be older.
For example, &#x27;rice wine&#x27; has the form in compounds such as &#x27;sake cup&#x27;.
The following alternations are the most common:
* &quot;i2&quot;/&quot;u-&quot;: / &#x27;god, spirit&#x27;, / &#x27;body&#x27;, / &#x27;a calm&#x27;. / &#x27;moon&#x27;, / &#x27;stalk&#x27;.
* &quot;i2&quot;/&quot;o2-&quot;: / &#x27;tree&#x27;, / &#x27;Hades&#x27;,
* &quot;e2&quot;/&quot;a-&quot;: / &#x27;eye&#x27;, / &#x27;heaven&#x27;, / &#x27;rain&#x27;, / &#x27;shade&#x27;, / &#x27;day, sun&#x27;, / &#x27;nail, hoof&#x27;, / &#x27;bamboo&#x27;.
The widely accepted analysis of this situation is that the most common Old Japanese vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;i1&quot; and &quot;o2&quot; reflect earlier *a, *u, *i and *ə respectively, and the other vowels reflect fusions of these vowels:
* &quot;i2&quot; &lt; *ui, *əi
* &quot;e1&quot; &lt; *ia, *iə
* &quot;e2&quot; &lt; *ai
* &quot;o1&quot; &lt; *ua, *uə
Thus the above independent forms of nouns can be derived from the bound form and a suffix *-i.
The origin of this suffix is debated, with one proposal being the ancestor of the obsolescent particle (whose function is also uncertain), and another being a weakened consonant (suggested by proposed Korean cognates).

There are also alternations suggesting &quot;e2&quot; &lt; *əi, such as / &#x27;back&#x27; and / &#x27;bud&#x27;.
Some authors believe that they belong to an earlier layer than &quot;i2&quot; &lt; *əi, but others reconstruct two central vowels *ə and *ɨ, which merged everywhere except before *i.
Other authors attribute the variation to different reflexes in different dialects and note that *əi yields &quot;e&quot; in Ryukyuan languages.

Some instances of word-final &quot;e1&quot; and &quot;o1&quot; are difficult to analyse as fusions, and some authors postulate *e and *o to account for such cases.
A few alternations, as well as comparisons with Eastern Old Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, suggest that *e and *o also occurred in non-word-final positions at an earlier stage but were raised in such positions to &quot;i1&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, respectively, in central Old Japanese.
The mid vowels are also found in some early and in some modern Japanese dialects.

== Grammar ==
As in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese word order was predominantly subject–object–verb, with adjectives and adverbs preceding the nouns and verbs they modify and auxiliary verbs and particles consistently appended to the main verb.

Nominals tended to have simple morphology and little fusion, in contrast to the complex inflectional morphology of verbs.
Japanese at all stages has used prefixes with both nouns and verbs, but Old Japanese also used prefixes for grammatical functions later expressed using suffixes.
This is atypical of SOV languages, and may suggest that the language was in the final stage of a transition from a SVO typology.

=== Nominals ===
==== Pronouns ====
Many Old Japanese pronouns had both a short form and a longer form with attached of uncertain etymology.
If the pronoun occurred in isolation, the longer form was used.
The short form was used with genitive particles or in nominal compounds, but in other situations either form was possible.

Personal pronouns were distinguished by taking the genitive marker , in contrast to the marker used with demonstratives and nouns.
* The first-person pronouns were and , were used for the singular and plural respectively, though with some overlap. The forms were also used reflexively, which suggests that was originally an indefinite pronoun and gradually replaced .
* The second-person pronoun was .
* The third-person pronoun was much less commonly used than the non-proximal demonstrative from which it was derived.
* There were also an interrogative pronoun and a reflexive pronoun .

Demonstratives often distinguished proximal (to the speaker) and non-proximal forms marked with and respectively.
Many forms had corresponding interrogative forms .

In Early Middle Japanese, the non-proximal forms were reinterpreted as hearer-based (medial), and the speaker-based forms were divided into proximal forms and distal / forms, yielding the three-way distinction that is still found in Modern Japanese.

==== Numerals ====
In later texts, such as the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, numerals were sometimes written using Chinese logographs, which give no indication of pronunciation.
The following numerals are attested phonographically:

The forms for 50 and 70 are known only from Heian texts.

There is a single example of a phonographically recorded compound number, in &quot;Bussokuseki&quot; 2:

This example uses the classifiers (used with tens and hundreds) and (used with digits and hundreds).

The only attested ordinal numeral is &#x27;first&#x27;.
In Classical Japanese, the other ordinal numerals had the same form as cardinals. This may also have been the case for Old Japanese, but there are no textual occurrences to settle the question.

==== Classifiers ====
The classifier system of Old Japanese was much less developed than at later stages of the language, and classifiers were not obligatory between numerals and nouns.
A few bound forms are attested phonographically: (used with digits and hundreds), (used with tens and hundreds), (for people), , (for grassy plants) and (for days).
Many ordinary nouns could also be used either freely or as classifiers.

==== Prefixes ====
Old Japanese nominal prefixes included honorific , intensive from &#x27;truth&#x27;, diminutive or affectionate and a prefix of uncertain function.

==== Suffixes ====
Old Japanese nominals had suffixes or particles to mark diminutives, plural number and case.
When multiple suffixes occurred, case markers came last. Unmarked nouns (but not pronouns) were neutral as to number.
The main plural markers were the general-purpose and two markers restricted to animate nouns, (limited to five words) and .

The main case particles were

* accusative marked objects (as in later Japanese) but also adverbials of duration.
* genitive (unrestricted) and (restricted to people). In Late Middle Japanese, shifted to a nominative case marker.
* dative or locative 
* ablative ~ ~ ~ from &#x27;after(wards)&#x27;. Only the form survived in Early Middle Japanese.
* comitative 

The subject of a sentence was usually not marked.
There are a few cases in the &quot;Senmyō&quot; of subjects of active verbs marked with a suffix , which is thought to be an archaism that was obsolete in the Old Japanese period.

=== Verbs ===
Old Japanese had a richer system of verbal suffixes than later forms of Japanese.
Old Japanese verbs used inflection for modal and conjunctional purposes.
Other categories, such as voice, tense, aspect and mood, were expressed by using optional suffixed auxiliaries, which were also inflected:

==== Inflected forms ====
As in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese verbs had a large number of inflected forms.
In traditional Japanese grammar, they are represented by six forms (, ) from which all the others may be derived in a similar fashion to the principal parts used for Latin and other languages:
; (irrealis)
:This form never occurs in isolation but only as a stem to which several particles and auxiliaries are attached. This stem originated from resegmentation of an initial of several suffixes (auxiliary verbs) as part of the stem.
; (adverbial, infinitive)
:This form was used as the infinitive. It also served as a stem for auxiliaries expressing tense and aspect.
; (conclusive, predicative)
:This form was used as the main verb concluding a declarative sentence. It was used also before modal extensions, final particles, and some conjunctional particles. The conclusive form merged with the attributive form by about 1600, but the distinction is preserved in the Ryukyuan languages and the Hachijōjima dialects.
; (attributive, adnominal)
:This form was used as the verb in a nominalized clause or a clause modifying a noun. It was also used before most conjunctional particles.
; (realis, exclamatory, subjunctive)
:This form was used as the main verb in an exclamatory sentence or as the verb in an adverbial clause. It also served as a stem for the particles (provisional) and (concessive).
; (imperative)
:This form expressed the imperative mood.

This system has been criticized because the six forms are not equivalent, with one being solely a combinatory stem, three solely word forms, and two being both.
It also fails to capture some inflected forms.
However, five of the forms are basic inflected verb forms, and the system also describes almost all extended forms consistently.

==== Conjugation classes ====

Old Japanese verbs are classified into eight conjugation classes that were originally defined for the classical Japanese of the late Heian period. In each class, the inflected forms showed a different pattern of rows of a kana table.
These rows correspond to the five vowels of later Japanese, but the discovery of the A/B distinction in Old Japanese showed a more refined picture.

Three of the classes are grouped as consonant bases:
; (quadrigrade)
:This class of regular consonant-base verbs includes approximately 75% of verbs. The class is so named because the inflections in later forms of Japanese span four rows of a table, corresponding to four vowels. However, the discovery of the A/B distinction revealed that this class actually involved five different vowels in Old Japanese, with distinct vowels &quot;e1&quot; and &quot;e2&quot; in the exclamatory and imperative forms respectively. The bases are almost all of the form (C)VC-, with the final consonant being &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or &quot;r&quot;.
; (&quot;n&quot;-irregular)
:The three &quot;n&quot;-base verbs form a class of their own: &#x27;die&#x27;, &#x27;depart&#x27; and the auxiliary expressing completion of an action. They are often described as a &quot;hybrid&quot; conjugation because the adnominal and exclamatory forms followed a similar pattern to vowel-base verbs.
; (&quot;r&quot;-irregular)
:The irregular &quot;r&quot;-base verbs were &#x27;be, exist&#x27; and other verbs that incorporated it, as well as &#x27;be sitting&#x27;, which became the existential verb in later forms of Japanese.

The distinctions between &quot;i1&quot; and &quot;i2&quot; and between &quot;e1&quot; and &quot;e2&quot; were eliminated after &quot;s&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;w&quot;.

There were five vowel-base conjugation classes:
; (lower bigrade or &quot;e&quot;-bigrade)
:The largest regular vowel-base class ended in &quot;e2&quot; and included approximately 20% of verbs.
; (upper bigrade or &quot;i&quot;-bigrade)
:This class of bases ended in &quot;i2&quot; and included about 30 verbs.
; (upper monograde or &quot;i&quot;-monograde)
:This class contains about 10 verbs of the form (C)&quot;i1-&quot;. Some monosyllabic &quot;i&quot;-bigrade verbs had already shifted to this class by Old Japanese, and the rest followed in Early Middle Japanese.
; (&quot;k&quot;-irregular)
:This class consists of the single verb &#x27;come&#x27;.
; (&quot;s&quot;-irregular)
:This class consists of the single verb &#x27;do&#x27;.
Early Middle Japanese also had a (lower monograde or &quot;e&quot;-monograde) category, consisting of a single verb &#x27;kick&#x27;, which reflected the Old Japanese lower bigrade verb .

The bigrade verbs seem to belong to a later layer than other verbs.
Many &quot;e&quot;-bigrade verbs are transitive or intransitive counterparts of consonant-base verbs.
In contrast, &quot;i&quot;-bigrade verbs tend to be intransitive.
Some bigrade bases also appear to reflect pre-Old-Japanese adjectives with vowel stems combined with an inchoative *-i suffix:
* *-a-i &gt; &quot;-e2&quot;, e.g. &#x27;redden, lighten&#x27; vs &#x27;red&#x27;.
* *-u-i &gt; &quot;-i2&quot;, e.g. &#x27;get desolate, fade&#x27; vs &#x27;lonely&#x27;.
* *-ə-i &gt; &quot;-i2&quot;, e.g. &#x27;get big, grow&#x27; vs &#x27;big&#x27;.

==== Copulas ====
Old Japanese had two copulas with limited and irregular conjugations:

The form had a limited distribution in Old Japanese, and disappeared in Early Middle Japanese. In later Japanese, the form became , but these forms have otherwise endured to modern Japanese.

==== Verbal prefixes ====
Japanese has used verbal prefixes conveying emphasis at all stages, but Old Japanese also had prefixes expressing grammatical functions, such as reciprocal or cooperative (from &#x27;meet, join&#x27;), stative (from &#x27;exist&#x27;), potential (from &#x27;get&#x27;) and prohibitive , which was often combined with a suffix .

==== Verbal auxiliaries ====

Old Japanese had a rich system of auxiliary elements that could be suffixed to verb stems and were themselves inflected, usually following the regular consonant-stem or vowel-stem paradigms, but never including the full range of stems found with full verbs.
Many of these disappeared in later stages of the language.

Tense and aspect were indicated by suffixes attached to the infinitive.
The tense suffixes were:
* the simple past (conclusive), (adnominal), (exclamatory). The variation may indicate an origin in multiple forms.
* the modal past or retrospective , a fusion of the simple past with &#x27;exist&#x27;.
* the past conjectural , a fusion of the simple past with the conjectural suffix .
The perfective suffixes were and .
During the Late Middle Japanese period, the tense and aspect suffixes were replaced with a single past-tense suffix , derived from + &#x27;exist&#x27; &gt; .

Other auxiliaries were attached to the irrealis stem:
* the negative and &lt; *
* the passive and 
* the causative 
* the honorific 
* the conjectural or tentative 
* the subjunctive 

===Adjectives===
Old Japanese adjectives were originally nominals and, unlike in later periods, could be used uninflected to modify following nouns.
They could also be conjugated as stative verbs in two classes:

The second class, with stems ending in , differed only in the conclusive form, whose suffix was dropped by haplology.
Adjectives of this class tended to express more subjective qualities.
Many of them were formed from a verbal stem by the addition of a suffix of uncertain origin.

Towards the end of the Old Japanese period, a more expressive conjugation was formed by adding the verb &#x27;be&#x27; to the infinitive, with the sequence reducing to :

Many adjectival nouns of Early Middle Japanese were based on Old Japanese adjectives that were formed with suffixes , or .

=== Focus construction ===

Old Japanese made extensive use of a focus construction, known as (&#x27;hanging-tying&#x27;), that established a copular relation between a constituent marked with a focus particle and a predicate in the adnominal form, instead of the conclusive form usually found in declarative sentences.
The marked constituent was also typically fronted in comparison with its position in a corresponding declarative sentence.
The semantic effect (though not the syntactic structure) was often similar to a cleft sentence in English:

The particles involved were
* , marking the focus of a yes–no question. The particle could also be used as a sentence-final marker of a yes–no question, in which case the verb would be in the usual conclusive form.
* , marking the interrogative word of an open question or the focus of a yes–no question.
* ~ , the usual declarative focus marker. By Early Middle Japanese, this had standardized as .
* , soliciting agreement, was rare in poetry but occurred in some prose works. By Early Middle Japanese, it had become .
* , making a more emphatic focus. In Early Middle Japanese, this particle occurred with a verb in the exclamatory form.

The focus construction was common in Old Japanese and Classical Japanese, but disappeared after the Early Middle Japanese period.
It is still found in Ryukyuan languages, but is much less common there than in Old Japanese.

==Dialects==
Although most Old Japanese writing represents the language of the Nara court in central Japan, some sources come from eastern Japan:
* 230 &#x27;eastern songs&#x27;, making up volume 14 of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;,
* 93 (101 according to some authors) &#x27;borderguard songs&#x27; in volume 20 of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, and
* 9 songs in the &quot;Hitachi Fudoki&quot; (recorded 714–718, but the oldest extant manuscripts date from the late 17th century and show significant corruption).

They record Eastern Old Japanese dialects, with several differences from central Old Japanese (also known as Western Old Japanese):
* There is no type A/B distinction on front vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, but &quot;o1&quot; and &quot;o2&quot; are distinguished.
* Pre-Old Japanese *ia yielded &quot;a&quot; in the east, where central Old Japanese has &quot;e1&quot;.
* The adnominal form of consonant-base verbs ended in &quot;-o1&quot;, but central Old Japanese ended in &quot;-u&quot; for both the adnominal and the conclusive forms. A similar difference is preserved in Ryukyuan languages, suggesting that central Old Japanese had innovated by merging those endings.
* The imperative form of vowel-base verbs attached , instead of the used in central Old Japanese. This difference has persisted into modern eastern and western dialects.
* There was a group of distinctive negative auxiliaries and , but they do not seem to be the source of the different negatives in the modern eastern and western Japanese dialects.
* A significant number of words borrowed from Ainu.

<doc id="1004629" wikidata="Q706327" url="?curid=1004629" title="Goguryeo language">
<text>The Goguryeo language, or Koguryoan, was the language of the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE – 668 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
Early Chinese histories state that the language was similar to those of Buyeo, Okjeo and Ye. Lee Ki-Moon grouped these four as the Puyŏ languages. The histories also stated that these languages were different from those of the Yilou and Mohe.
All of these languages are unattested except for Goguryeo, for which evidence is limited and controversial.

The most cited evidence is a body of placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;.
Most researchers in Korea, assuming that the people of Goguryeo spoke a dialect of Old Korean, have treated these words as Korean, while other scholars have emphasized similarities with Japonic languages.
Lee and Ramsey suggest that the language was intermediate between the two families.
Other authors suggest that these placenames reflect the languages of other peoples in the part of central Korea captured by Goguryeo in the 5th century, rather than Goguryeo itself.

Other evidence is extremely sparse, and is limited to peculiarities in the Chinese language of Goguryeo inscriptions and a very few Goguryeo words glossed in Chinese texts.
Vovin and Unger suggest that it was the original form of Koreanic, which subsequently replaced Japonic languages in the south of the peninsula.
Others maintain that it was Tungusic, or that there is insufficient evidence to establish its affiliation.

== Descriptions in Chinese sources ==
Chinese histories provide the only contemporaneous descriptions of peoples of the Korean peninsula and eastern Manchuria in the early centuries of the common era.
They contain impressionistic remarks about the languages of the area based on second-hand reports, and sometimes contradict one another.
Later Korean histories, such as the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, do not describe the languages of the three kingdoms.

The state of Buyeo, in the upper Songhua basin, was known to the Chinese from the 3rd century BCE.
Chapter 30 &quot;Description of the Eastern Barbarians&quot; of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; records a survey carried out by the Chinese state of Wei after their defeat of Goguryeo in 244.
Another version of this report, likely from a common source, is found in chapter 85 of the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; (5th century).
The report states that the languages of Buyeo, Goguryeo and Ye were similar, and that the language of Okjeo was only slightly different from them.
Goguryeo, originally inhabiting the valley of the Hun River, believed themselves to be a southern offshoot of Buyeo.
Over the next few centuries they would expand to rule much of eastern Manchuria and northern Korea.

To the south of the Chinese Lelang Commandery lay the Samhan (&#x27;three Han&#x27;), Mahan, Byeonhan and Jinhan, who the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; described in quite different terms from Buyeo and Goguryeo.
Based on this text, Lee Ki-Moon divided the languages spoken on the Korean peninsula at that time into Puyŏ and Han groups.

The same text states that the language of the Yilou to the northeast differed from that of Buyeo and Goguryeo.
Chapter 94 of the &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot; (compiled in 659) states that the language of the Mohe in the same area was different from that of Goguryeo.
These languages are completely unattested, but are believed, on the basis of their location and the description of the people, to have been Tungusic.

The &quot;Book of Liang&quot; (635) states that the language of Baekje was the same as that of Goguryeo.
According to Korean traditional history, the kingdom of Baekje was founded by immigrants from Goguryeo who took over Mahan.

== Placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; ==
The most widely cited evidence for Goguryeo is chapter 37 of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, a history of the Three Kingdoms period written in Classical Chinese and compiled in 1145 from earlier records that are no longer extant.
This chapter surveys the part of Goguryeo annexed by Silla, with entries like

The phrase &#x27;one calls&#x27; separates two alternative names for a place.
The first part, , can be read in Chinese as &#x27;seven-fold county&#x27;, while is meaningless, and hence seems to use Chinese characters to represent the sound of the name.
From other examples, scholars infer that means &#x27;seven&#x27; and means &#x27;-fold, layer&#x27;, while the &#x27;county&#x27; part of the gloss is not represented.
In this way, a vocabulary of 80 to 100 words has been extracted from these place names.
Although the pronunciations recorded using Chinese characters are difficult to interpret, some of these words appear to resemble Koreanic, Japonic and Tungusic words.
It is generally agreed that these glosses demonstrate that Japonic languages were once spoken in part of the Korean peninsula, but there is no consensus on the identity of the speakers.

Scholars who take these words as representing the language of Goguryeo have come to a range of conclusions about the language.
Most Korean scholars view it as a form of Old Korean and focus on Korean interpretations of the data.
In the early 20th century, Japanese scholars such as Naitō Konan and Shinmura Izuru pointed out similarities to Japanese, particularly in the only attested numerals, 3, 5, 7 and 10:

Beckwith proposed Japonic etymologies for most of the words, and argued that Koguryoan was Japonic.
Beckwith&#x27;s linguistic analysis has been criticized for the &quot;ad hoc&quot; nature of his Chinese reconstructions, for his handling of Japonic material and for hasty rejection of possible cognates in other languages.
Lee and Ramsey argue that Koguryoan was somehow intermediate between Koreanic and Japonic.

Other authors point out that most of the place names come from central Korea, an area captured by Goguryeo from Baekje and other states in the 5th century, and none from the historical homeland of Goguryeo north of the Taedong River.
By the 5th century, Goguryeo ruled a huge area encompassing many ethnic groups and languages.
These authors suggest that the place names reflect the languages of those states rather than that of Goguryeo.
This would explain why they seem to reflect multiple language groups.

== Other data ==

Other data on the language of Goguryeo is extremely sparse, and its affiliation remains unclear.

A small number of inscriptions have been found in Goguryeo territory, including the Gwanggaeto Stele (erected in Ji&#x27;an in 414), four inscriptions on the walls of Pyongyang Castle, and a stele in Jungwon, Chungju (590s).
All are written in Chinese, but some of them contain irregularities, including a few examples of object–verb order (as found in Korean and other northeast Asian languages) instead of the usual Chinese verb–object order, and some uses of the characters and , which some authors have connected to their use to represent Korean particles in later Idu texts from Unified Silla.

Beckwith identified a dozen names of places and people in Chinese histories that he argued were Goguryeo words.
In his review of Beckwith&#x27;s book, Byington criticized the historical basis of these identifications, as well as Beckwith&#x27;s theories of Goguryeo origins in western Liaoning.

Chinese histories contain a few glosses of Goguryeo words:
* Chapter 30 of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (late 3rd century) states that (Eastern Han Chinese *, Middle Chinese ) is the Goguryeo word for &#x27;castle&#x27;. Beckwith compared this word with Old Japanese &#x27;storehouse&#x27;. Alexander Vovin compared it with Middle Mongolian and Manchu &#x27;fortified town&#x27;, but with lenition of &quot;t&quot; as in Korean.
* Chapter 100 of the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (mid-6th century) gives &#x27;big elder brother&#x27; and &#x27;little elder brother&#x27;. Vovin compared with Late Middle Korean &#x27;old&#x27; and with an Early Middle Korean word &#x27;small, young&#x27; transcribed as () in the &quot;Jilin leishi&quot; (1103–1104). The word is closely matched by Old Japanese &#x27;elder brother&#x27;, but this has a limited distribution in Japonic, and may be a loanword.
* The same chapter gives the name of Jumong, the legendary founder of Goguryeo, as (Middle Chinese ), glossed as &#x27;good archer&#x27;. This name appears in the Gwanggaeto Stele as (Eastern Han Chinese *dẓo-mu, Middle Chinese ). Vovin compared the first syllable with Middle Korean &#x27;be good&#x27;, but was unable to identify a match for the second part.
* Chapter 41 of the &quot;Book of Zhou&quot; (early 7th century) gives &#x27;ceremonial headgear&#x27;, which Vovin compared with the first part of Middle Korean &#x27;ceremonial headgear&#x27;.

Vovin also pointed to Koreanic loanwords in Jurchen and Manchu, and argued that the Goguryeo language was the ancestor of Koreanic, and spread southwards to replace the Japonic languages of the Samhan. James Unger has proposed a similar model on historical grounds.

Other authors suggest that the Goguryeo language was a Tungusic language.
Juha Janhunen argues for a Tungusic affiliation based on historical evidence that the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty and later the Manchus of the Qing dynasty that rose from the former territory of Goguryeo were Tungusic speakers.

<doc id="1004631" wikidata="Q6553031" url="?curid=1004631" title="Line-out code">
<text>A line-out code is a coded piece of information, used to communicate intentions about a line-out within one team in a rugby union match without giving information away to the other team. A line-out is a manoeuvre used to restart play when the ball has left the pitch. The right to throw in the ball will be awarded to one team or the other but, in theory at least, the throw will be straight down the middle whichever team is making it. The advantage comes from knowing in advance how the throw will be made — whether short and fast to the front of the line or looping slowly to the back.

==Encoded information==
===Receiver selection===
The most important piece of information to be encoded is to where in the line the ball is to be thrown. This allows the receiving players to concentrate their effort in lifting the relevant catcher, whereas the opposition must attempt to cover the whole line.

===Post-catch action===
As well as the length of the throw, some teams will attempt to specify what the catcher should do with the ball when he has it - whether to simply knock it back towards his own team, catch it and then pass it while still up in the air (supported by his team mates) or catch it and bring it down to form a maul. Such a call can only be advice to the catcher, since he may not get a clean catch and the choice of what to do.

===Set pieces===
Finally, the code may have a means of calling for a specific pre-planned move. This is usually just a particular word - the play won&#x27;t be used often enough in a match for the opposition to work out what the word means. For example, the code-word &quot;postman&quot; might indicate that the ball is to be caught by the jumper (typically number four) and held briefly while a player from the back of the line-out runs along the line. As he passes the catcher the ball is passed down to him, he continues on to the front of the line, and slips through the gap between the front of the line and the edge of the pitch.

==Encoding methods==
There are a wealth of different codes in use to obfuscate the planned tactic. One scheme uses a set of three words which share no letters (e.g. &quot;THAMES ROWING CLUB&quot; or &quot;THE BIG DON&quot;). The first word will signify the front of the line, the second the middle, and the third the back of the line. The call will then incorporate a letter from one of the words, indicating where the throw will be made. There are also numerical codes, and more esoteric ones involving anything from the number of legs on animals to the personal characteristics of people known to the team.

These basic elements will be combined by the caller into a phrase intended to confuse the opposition while transferring the plan to his team. Most of this phrase will be &quot;padding&quot; intended to hide the true method - for example, &quot;127 ZD Kangaroo&quot; could be decoded simply as a throw to the front of the line.

<doc id="1004644" wikidata="Q260887" url="?curid=1004644" title="Robot Monster">
<text>Robot Monster (or Monster from Mars) is a 1953 independently made American black-and-white 3D science fiction horror film, remembered in later decades as one of the worst movies ever made. It was produced and directed by Phil Tucker, written by Wyott Ordung, and stars George Nader, Claudia Barrett, and George Barrows. The production company was Three Dimensional Pictures, Inc. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures.

&quot;Robot Monster&quot; tells the story of the alien robot Ro-Man&#x27;s mission to Earth to destroy humanity. He manages to kill all but eight survivors, who have become immune to his death ray. Ro-Man runs afoul of the Great Guidance, his leader, when he becomes attracted to the human Alice. She is the eldest daughter of a surviving scientist, and he refuses to harm her. The Great Guidance must now come to Earth and finish what the Moon robot started.

==Plot==

Ro-Man Extension XJ-2 referred to as just Ro-Man (a creature with an ape-like body and an antenna-equipped helmet covering its head and emitting electric flashes), has destroyed all human life on Earth with a Calcinator death ray to prevent Humanity from challenging his race, except for eight humans who remain alive in a protected facility. The survivors are a professor, whose name is never mentioned; his wife; their two daughters, Alice and Carla; their young son, Johnny; the professor&#x27;s assistant, Roy; and space pilots Jason and McCloud (neither of whom is seen or heard). Both pilots depart in a rocket ship for an orbiting space platform. All eight have developed an immunity to Ro-Man&#x27;s death ray, having received an experimental antibiotic serum developed by the professor intended to cure all diseases.

Ro-Man must complete the destruction of all humans, even if it means his physically killing them one by one, before his mission to subjugate the Earth is complete. After fruitless negotiations, Ro-Man destroys Jason and McCloud&#x27;s spaceship that had been sent into space to escape, along with the space platform. The Professor uses the machine intended to contact Jason and McCloud to instead contact Ro-Man, pleading for him to let them go as they pose no threat to him. Ro-Man instead demands to talk to Alice alone, who agrees despite her family&#x27;s protests. When Johnny leaves to find Ro-Man, Alice ventures out with Roy to find him. Johnny confronts Ro-Man and reveals his immunity to the death ray, causing Ro-Man to begin planning a method to counteract this immunity.

Alice and Roy find Johnny, and after inexplicably kissing each other while still in danger, return to the facility. Alice and Roy announce to the professor their desire to marry. The Professor then declares it the biggest event of the year. Ro-Man contacts Great Guidance (referred to as &quot;The Great One&quot;), leader of the Ro-Man Empire, to announce his plan, and is told that he must complete this goal before the Earth finishes revolving. The marriage is conducted, with the Professor asking the Lord for a victory in Mankind&#x27;s struggle. Ro-Man discovers Carla outside the facility and strangles her.

Ro-Man&#x27;s mission is waylaid, however, when he develops an illogical attraction to Alice and cannot bring himself to eliminate her, asking the Great One if he may keep one human, but the Great One demands that he continue the mission. Ro-Man rediscovers Alice and Roy, and throws Roy off a cliff. He explains to Alice that the source of his energy lies in his cave, where he takes her and attempts to woo her before being interrupted by the Professor&#x27;s broadcast. They ask for a quick death at the ravine, and Ro-Man agrees. Immediately after this, the Great One contacts him, angry at him for thinking up the plan to keep the girl and accusing him of bearing free will in violation of Ro-Man law. He gives Ro-Man one last chance to destroy the girl, which Ro-Man refuses to. Johnny distracts him, allowing the family to save Alice. Both Johnny and Ro-Man are suddenly killed by the Great One with a Calcinator blast. The Great One continues the genocide with Cosmic Q-Rays, which cause prehistoric reptiles to appear; and psychotronic vibrations, which &quot;smash the planet Earth out of the universe&quot;.

But Johnny is alive, having just awakened from a concussion-induced fever dream. Up to now, all that has happened has just been his nightmare. His sisters, their mother, and the two scientists, whom the family met while picnicking in Bronson Canyon, rejoice at finding him. Johnny and his family invite the scientists home for dinner; they accept.

Suddenly, Ro-Man, his arms raised in a threatening manner after having just arrived on Earth, walks out of his cave directly &quot;toward&quot; the audience.

==Production==
Twenty-five-year-old writer/director Tucker made &quot;Robot Monster&quot; in four days for an estimated , although film journals from the time reported that it cost $50,000. Except for a few scenes at a house in Los Angeles and a building site near Dodger Stadium, most footage was filmed outdoors in Bronson Canyon, the site of innumerable motion pictures and TV settings. It also included stock footage from &quot;Flight to Mars&quot; (1951) and &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940). Its working titles were &quot;Monsters from the Moon&quot; and &quot;Monster from Mars&quot;. Principal photography on &quot;Robot Monster&quot; wrapped on March 23, 1953.

&quot;Robot Monster&quot;″s very low budget did not allow for a robot costume as first intended, so Tucker hired his friend Barrows, who had made his own gorilla suit, to play Ro-Man; Tucker then added a space helmet similar to those used in Republic serials such as &quot;Radar Men from the Moon&quot;.
&quot;Robot Monster&quot; is similar in its plot to &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;, released a month earlier by 20th Century Fox. Both films contain a young boy, stumbling upon an alien invasion, who is captured as he struggles to save his family and himself. As the alien commences the final destruction of Earth, the boy awakens to find it was all a dream. Barrett recalled in an interview that the film&#x27;s original screenplay was designed as reality, but director Tucker changed his mind and then shot a new twist ending that showed the film&#x27;s story has been a boy&#x27;s dream that is about to come true.

In &quot;Robot Monster&quot;″s opening credits, &quot;N. A. Fischer Chemical Products&quot; is given prominent credit for the &quot;Billion Bubble Machine&quot;, used as part of Ro-Man&#x27;s communication device for reporting to his superior, the Great Guidance.

The film was preceded in theatres by &quot;Stardust in Your Eyes&quot;, a one-reel 3D monologue by comic/impressionist Trustin Howard, performing under his stage name &quot;Slick Slavin.&quot;

===3D===
&quot;Robot Monster&quot; was shot and projected in dual-strip, polarized 3D. The stereoscopic photography in the film is considered by many critics to be high quality, especially for a film whose crew had little experience with the newly developed camera rig. Producer Al Zimbalist later told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that shooting the film in 3D (which involved using another camera) added an extra $4,510.54 to the budget.

===Special effects===
&quot;Robot Monster&quot;″s special effects include stock footage from &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940), &quot;Lost Continent&quot; (1951), and &quot;Flight to Mars&quot; (1951); a brief appearance of the &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; (1950) spaceship boarding; and a matte painting of the ruins of New York City from &quot;Captive Women&quot; (1952).

===Film score===
&quot;Robot Monster&quot;″s music score was composed by Elmer Bernstein, who also composed &quot;Cat Women of the Moon&quot; the same year, and later, the more prestigious &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; music video, and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

Bernstein recalled he was stuck in a period where he was &quot;greylisted&quot; because of his left-wing politics and only offered minor films, but said he enjoyed the challenge of trying to help a film. Ordung stated that Bernstein scored the film with an eight-piece orchestra, and Capitol Records expressed interest in producing an album. One critic told how he had watched the film as a teenager when it was first shown on television in 1954 and said it was &quot;one of Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s best very early scores.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Robot Monster&quot; was released by Astor Pictures on June 24, 1953, at a runtime of 62 minutes. It was originally released with the Three Dimension Pictures short &quot;Stardust in Your Eyes&quot;, starring nightclub comedian Trustin Howard as Slick Slavin. It grossed during its initial theatrical release, more than 60 times its original investment.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===
The December 1952 review in &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;Judged on the basis of novelty, as a showcase for the Tru-Stereo Process, &quot;Robot Monster&quot; comes off surprisingly well, considering the extremely limited budget ($50,000) and schedule on which the film was shot&quot;.

In June 1953, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a crazy mixed up movie ... even children may be a little bored by it all&quot; and &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, the following month, called it &quot;the poorest 3-D picture that [has] been made so far.&quot; Adding, &quot;the story is completely illogical, and the supposed monsters from another planet are laughable. Even the acting, at times, is ridiculous&quot;.

In December 1953, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;theater men&quot; considered the film &quot;one of the top turkeys of the year.&quot;

===Legacy===
The film holds a 36% approval rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 4.15/10.

The film is frequently considered one of the worst movies ever made, with film historian Leonard Maltin writing in his 2009 Movie Guide, &quot;[Robot Monster is] one of the genuine legends of Hollywoodembarrassingly, hilariously awful [...] just dig that bubble-machine with the TV antenna.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In December 1953, it was reported that Tucker tried to commit suicide at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel. He was saved only because he had written a suicide letter and sent it to a newspaper, which sent a reporter and some detectives to the hotel. He was discovered with a pass in his pocket from the psychopathic ward of a veteran&#x27;s hospital. In the letter, Tucker said he had not been paid for &quot;Robot Monster&quot; and was unable to get a job. &quot;When I was refused a jobeven as an usher&quot;, Tucker wrote, &quot;I finally realized my future in the film industry was bleak.&quot; It was revealed that Tucker and the producer had quarreled, and film exhibitors had instructions not to let Tucker in to see the film unless he paid admission.

In &quot;Keep Watching the Skies!&quot;, a comprehensive history of 1950s and early 1960s American science-fiction films, author Bill Warren claimed that Tucker&#x27;s attempted suicide was due to depression and a dispute with the film&#x27;s distributor, who had allegedly refused to pay Tucker his contracted percentage of the film&#x27;s profits.

The actors connected to &quot;Robot Monster&quot; included George Nader, who won the Golden Globe in 1955 as &quot;Most Promising Male Newcomer of the Year&quot; (although his award was not tied to his &quot;Robot Monster&quot; performance). He signed with Universal Studios, where he starred only in secondary features. 

Selena Royle, an MGM stock player, had a durable film career beginning in 1941, but it ended in 1951 when she was branded a Communist sympathizer. She refused to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and eventually cleared her name. By then, the damage to her reputation had already been done; she made only two additional films, &quot;Robot Monster&quot; being her last.

==In popular culture==

*Ro-Man is seen in the 2003 film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;.
*In the 2010 animated film &quot;Megamind&quot;, the character Minion (voiced by David Cross) resembles Ro-Man, with the body of a gorilla and a transparent head with a fish in it.
*It was the feature film of the 1989 episode 107 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.
*SCP-2006, a creature from the SCP Foundation, prefers to take the form of Ro-Man.

<text>Democratic Left was a post-communist political organisation in the United Kingdom during the 1990s, growing out of the Eurocommunist strand within the Communist Party of Great Britain and its magazine &quot;Marxism Today&quot; (which closed around the same time).

It was established in 1991 when the CPGB decided to reform itself into a left-leaning reformist political multi-issue grassroots think-tank based on the party&#x27;s &quot;Manifesto for New Times&quot;. Its secretary was Nina Temple, the last general secretary of the CPGB.

Many members of the CPGB disagreed with this decision and joined the Communist Party of Britain, which had broken away from the CPGB in 1988, while some Scottish members formed the Communist Party of Scotland.

==Worldview==
Democratic Left stated a belief in a pluralist and socialist society &quot;incompatible with the structures and values of capitalism.&quot; Beginning as a political party, it decided not to stand candidates but instead to support tactical voting against the Conservatives at the 1992 general election and soon become a non-party campaigning organisation. DL campaigned on modernising unions, including Unions21; anti-racism and cultural diversity; democratising Britain, including Make Votes Count; social exclusion and poverty, including the Social Exclusion Network; focusing on coalition building, and operating in effect as a &#x27;socialist anti-Conservative front&#x27;.

A series of policy magazines titled &quot;Futures&quot; were published in 1997 as the group tried to stem falling membership. Members of the Trotskyist-dominated Socialist Alliance tried to join in 1998, but were blocked after legal action was taken, and the decision was taken to stop being &quot;stuck in the swamp of sectarian politics.&quot; Democratic Left in England and Wales was dissolved and reformed as the New Times Network in December 1998, open to members of Labour and other political parties. It published a monthly magazine, &quot;New Times&quot;, and collaborated with the Fabian Society on the &#x27;Getting Real&#x27; conference in June 1999. New Times Network became the New Politics Network in December 1999. In Scotland it continues as Democratic Left Scotland, founded in May 1998.

<doc id="1004661" wikidata="Q7831956" url="?curid=1004661" title="Trade Marks Act 1994">
<text>The Trade Marks Act 1994 (c. 26) is the law governing trade marks within the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. It implements EU Directive No. 89/104/EEC (The Trade Marks Directive) which forms the framework for the trade mark laws of all EU member states, and replaced an earlier law, the Trade Marks Act 1938 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 6. c. 22). Although the UK&#x27;s trade mark regime covers the Isle of Man, it does not extend to the Channel Islands which have their own trade mark registers.

The Act provides both civil and criminal law sanctions for the misuse of registered trade marks. 
Section 93 of the Act makes enforcement of the criminal sanctions the duty of the local Weights and Measures Authority (usually the Trading Standards department) and imports enforcement powers from the Trade Descriptions Act.

Similar criminal law provisions are written into the related Copyright Designs and Patents Act.

The UK Patent Office, which deals with trade mark registration, has recently implemented a national intelligence database, TellPat, which is available to enforcement officers.

== Trade mark definition/eligibility ==
Section 1(1) (as of 14th Jan 2019) defines a trade mark as:

&quot;any sign which is capable—a) of being represented in the register in a manner which enables the register and other competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to the proprietor, and b) of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.&quot;

A trade mark may, in particular, consist of words (including personal names), designs, letters, numerals, colors, sounds, the shape of goods, or their packaging.

=== Judicial interpretation of Section 1(1) === 

* &quot;Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited&quot; [2013]
*:The Court of Appeal decided that Cadbury&#x27;s attempts to register a specific shade of purple (Pantone 2684C) was not able to be registered as a trade mark. They reasoned that the marks description, meaning &quot;the predominant colour applied to the whole visible surface of the packaging of the goods,&quot; did not satisfy the requirement of a sign or the requirement of the graphical representation of a sign within the meaning of Article 2 of the Trade Marks Directive 2008/95/EC. 
* &quot;Ralf Sieckmann v Deutsches Patent und Markenamt&quot; [2002]
*:This is the leading authority on the graphical representation of non-conventional trademarks under the European Trade Marks Directive. Siekman were unsuccessful in their registration of a “methyl cinnamate” scent described as “balsamically fruity with a hint of cinnamon.” The court ruled that the chemical formula was not acceptable as a graphic representation for the purposes of the directive. Additionally, a written description of the smell and formula was not sufficiently clear and precise and objective to constitute a graphical representation. The judicial remarks later become known as the &quot;Sieckman criteria or Sieckman Seven.&quot; These state that a sign must be, clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable, and objective.
* Case R 708/2006 Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc [2007]
*:This concerned Edgar Rice Burroughs application to trade mark Tarzan&#x27;s scream. The application included a picture of the sound spectrum of the character&#x27;s yell. The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) refused the application on appeal. The sound spectrum of the character&#x27;s scream did not amount to sufficient graphical representation of the mark.
* &quot;Red Bull v EUIPO&quot; [2017] (Red Bull case)
*:This decision of the EU general court concerned two trade mark registrations for energy drinks using the color combination of Blue and Silver. The court held the marks were not sufficiently precise as the mere juxtaposition of two colors (blue and silver) would allow for numerous color combinations.

== Exclusions from trade mark protection ==

Section 3(1), Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) set out absolute grounds for refusal of trade mark registration.

Section 3(1) states that the following shall not be registered — a) signs which do not satisfy the requirements of section 1(1), b) trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character, c) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of services, or other characteristics of goods or services, d) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade.

Section 3(1) also contains a proviso that states: a trade mark shall not be refused registration by virtue of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) above if before the date of the application it has in fact acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it.

Section 3(2) states that a sign shall not be registered as a trade mark if it consists exclusively of — a) the shape (or other characteristic), which results from the nature of the goods themselves, b) the shape (or other characteristic), of goods which are necessary to a obtain a technical result, c) the shape (or other characteristic), which gives substantial value to the goods.

Section 3(3) states that a trade mark is not registrable if it is — a) contrary to public policy or morality or b) of such nature to deceive the public (deceptive marks)

Section 3(4) states that a trade mark shall not be registered— if or to the extent that its use is prohibited in the United Kingdom by any enactment or rule of law or by any provision of EU law.

Section 3(5) states a trade mark shall not be registered in the cases specified, or referred to, in section 4 (specially protected emblems).

Section 3(6) states a trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.

=== Judicial interpretation of section 3 ===

* Kit Kat case [2018]
*:This case concerned the application of Section 3(1) to Nestle&#x27;s four-fingered chocolate bar the &#x27;Kit Kat&#x27;. The key issue was whether Nestlé had sufficiently demonstrated that the Kit Kat-shaped mark had acquired distinctive character throughout the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union held that Nestle only produced evidence relevant to some not all of the member states— consequentially they had failed to show that the Kit Kat shared mark had acquired distinctiveness throughout the EU. The result of this is the mark was not granted trade mark protection.
* &quot;Christian Louboutin v Van Haren Schoenen BV&quot; [2018]
*:This case concerned the application of Article 3(1)(e)(iii) of the EU Directive No. 89/104/EEC (Incorporated into UK law via Section 3(2)(c). The question asked of the Court of Justice of the European Union was whether the concept of shape contained in Article 3(1)(e)(iii) of the directive was limited to three dimensional characteristics of goods or whether it would pertain to other marks such as colors. The court held that the red sign (Pantone 18 1663TP ) did not consist exclusively of a shape which gave substantial value to the goods which meant the mark was valid. In other words, the contour of the Louboutin designed sole was only intended to show the positional orientation of the mark (the colour red) and was not part of the trade mark application itself.

== Changes from 1938 Act ==
The introduction of new primary legislation for trade marks in 1994 enabled the government to make a number of changes beyond merely implementing the EU directive. These include:

* Removing the two-part registration system: under the 1938 Act, trademarks were registered into two distinct parts (Part A and B) with different distinctiveness requirements.
* Allowing applications to multiple classes.
* Ensuring the registration requirements for goods and services are as similar as possible.

The Act also provides for a defence of &quot;honest&quot; use of a natural name.

<text>The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970. The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score.

==Introduction==
This algorithm can be used for any two strings. This guide will use two small DNA sequences as examples as shown in Figure 1:
 GCATGCG
 GATTACA

===Constructing the grid===
First construct a grid such as one shown in Figure 1 above. Start the first string in the top of the third column and start the other string at the start of the third row. Fill out the rest of the column and row headers as in Figure 1. There should be no numbers in the grid yet.

===Choosing a scoring system===
Next, decide how to score each individual pair of letters. Using the example above, one possible alignment candidate might be:
 12345678
 

The letters may match, mismatch, or be matched to a gap (a deletion or insertion (indel)):
* Match: The two letters at the current index are the same.
* Mismatch: The two letters at the current index are different. 
* Indel (Insertion or Deletion): The best alignment involves one letter aligning to a gap in the other string.

Each of these scenarios is assigned a score and the sum of the scores of all the pairings is the score of the whole alignment candidate. Different systems exist for assigning scores; some have been outlined in the Scoring systems section below. For now, the system used by Needleman and Wunsch will be used:

* Match: +1
* Mismatch or Indel: −1

For the Example above, the score of the alignment would be 0:
 
 +−++−−+− −&gt; 1*4 + (−1)*4 = 0

===Filling in the table===
Start with a zero in the first row, first column (not including the cells containing nucleotides). Move through the cells row by row, calculating the score for each cell. The score is calculated by comparing the scores of the cells neighboring to the left, top or top-left (diagonal) of the cell and adding the appropriate score for match, mismatch or indel. Take the maximum of the candidate scores for each of the three possibilities:
* The path from the top or left cell represents an indel pairing, so take the scores of the left and the top cell, and add the score for indel to each of them.
* The diagonal path represents a match/mismatch, so take the score of the top-left diagonal cell and add the score for match if the corresponding bases (letters) in the row and column are matching or the score for mismatch if they do not.
The resulting score for the cell is the highest of the three candidate scores.

Given there is no &#x27;top&#x27; or &#x27;top-left&#x27; cells for the first row only the existing cell to the left can be used to calculate the score of each cell. Hence −1 is added for each shift to the right as this represents an indel from the previous score. This results in the first row being 0, −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, −6, −7. The same applies to the first column as only the existing score above each cell can be used. Thus the resulting table is:

The first case with existing scores in all 3 directions is the intersection of our first letters (in this case G and G). The surrounding cells are below:
This cell has three possible candidate sums:

* The diagonal top-left neighbor has score 0. The pairing of G and G is a match, so add the score for match: 0+1 = 1
* The top neighbor has score −1 and moving from there represents an indel, so add the score for indel: (−1) + (−1) = (−2)
* The left neighbor also has score −1, represents an indel and also produces (−2).

The highest candidate is 1 and is entered into the cell:

The cell which gave the highest candidate score must also be recorded. In the completed diagram in figure 1 above, this is represented as an arrow from the cell in row and column 2 to the cell in row and column 1.

In the next example, the diagonal step for both X and Y represents a mismatch:

X:
* Top: (−2)+(−1) = (−3)
* Left: (+1)+(−1) = (0)
* Top-Left: (−1)+(−1) = (−2)

Y:
* Top: (1)+(−1) = (0)
* Left: (−2)+(−1) = (−3)
* Top-Left: (−1)+(−1) = (−2)

For both X and Y, the highest score is zero:

The highest candidate score may be reached by two of the neighboring cells:

* Top: (1)+(−1) = (0)
* Top-Left: (1)+(−1) = (0)
* Left: (0)+(−1) = (−1)

In this case, all directions reaching the highest candidate score must be noted as possible origin cells in the finished diagram in figure 1, e.g. in the cell in row and column 6.

Filling in the table in this manner gives the scores of all possible alignment candidates, the score in the cell on the bottom right represents the alignment score for the best alignment.

===Tracing arrows back to origin===
Mark a path from the cell on the bottom right back to the cell on the top left by following the direction of the arrows. From this path, the sequence is constructed by these rules:
* A diagonal arrow represents a match or mismatch, so the letter of the column and the letter of the row of the origin cell will align.
* A horizontal or vertical arrow represents an indel. Vertical arrows will align a gap (&quot;-&quot;) to the letter of the row (the &quot;side&quot; sequence), horizontal arrows will align a gap to the letter of the column (the &quot;top&quot; sequence).
* If there are multiple arrows to choose from, they represent a branching of the alignments. If two or more branches all belong to paths from the bottom right to the top left cell, they are equally viable alignments. In this case, note the paths as separate alignment candidates.

Following these rules, the steps for one possible alignment candidate in figure 1 are:

 G → CG → GCG → -GCG → T-GCG → AT-GCG → CAT-GCG → GCAT-GCG
 A → CA → ACA → TACA → TTACA → ATTACA → -ATTACA → G-ATTACA
 (branch) → TGCG → -TGCG → ...
 → TACA → TTACA → ...

==Scoring systems==

===Basic scoring schemes===
The simplest scoring schemes simply give a value for each match, mismatch and indel. The step-by-step guide above uses match = 1, mismatch = −1, indel = −1. Thus the lower the alignment score the larger the edit distance, for this scoring system one wants a high score. Another scoring system might be:
* Match = 0
* Indel = -1
* Mismatch = -1

For this system the alignment score will represent the edit distance between the two strings.
Different scoring systems can be devised for different situations, for example if gaps are considered very bad for your alignment you may use a scoring system that penalises gaps heavily, such as:

* Match = 1
* Indel = -10
* Mismatch = -1
===Similarity matrix===
More complicated scoring systems attribute values not only for the type of alteration, but also for the letters that are involved. For example, a match between A and A may be given 1, but a match between T and T may be given 4. Here (assuming the first scoring system) more importance is given to the Ts matching than the As, i.e. the Ts matching is assumed to be more significant to the alignment. This weighting based on letters also applies to mismatches.

In order to represent all the possible combinations of letters and their resulting scores a similarity matrix is used. The similarity matrix for the most basic system is represented as:
Each score represents a switch from one of the letters the cell matches to the other. Hence this represents all possible matches and mismatches (for an alphabet of ACGT). Note all the matches go along the diagonal, also not all the table needs to be filled, only this triangle because the scores are reciprocal.= (Score for A → C = Score for C → A). If implementing the T-T = 4 rule from above the following similarity matrix is produced:

Different scoring matrices have been statistically constructed which give weight to different actions appropriate to a particular scenario. Having weighted scoring matrices is particularly important in protein sequence alignment due to the varying frequency of the different amino acids. There are two broad families of scoring matrices, each with further alterations for specific scenarios:
* PAM
* BLOSUM

===Gap penalty===
When aligning sequences there are often gaps (i.e. indels), sometimes large ones. Biologically, a large gap is more likely to occur as one large deletion as opposed to multiple single deletions. Hence two small indels should have a worse score than one large one. The simple and common way to do this is via a large gap-start score for a new indel and a smaller gap-extension score for every letter which extends the indel. For example, new-indel may cost -5 and extend-indel may cost -1. In this way an alignment such as:
 GAAAAAAT
 G--A-A-T
which has multiple equal alignments, some with multiple small alignments will now align as:
 GAAAAAAT
 GAA----T
or any alignment with a 4 long gap in preference over multiple small gaps.

==Advanced presentation of algorithm==
Scores for aligned characters are specified by a similarity matrix. Here, is the similarity of characters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. It uses a linear gap penalty, here called .

For example, if the similarity matrix was
then the alignment:
 AGACTAGTTAC
 CGA---GACGT
with a gap penalty of −5, would have the following score:
:= −3 + 7 + 10 − (3 × 5) + 7 + (−4) + 0 + (−1) + 0 = 1

To find the alignment with the highest score, a two-dimensional array (or matrix) &quot;F&quot; is allocated. The entry in row &quot;i&quot; and column &quot;j&quot; is denoted here by
formula_1. There is one row for each character in sequence &quot;A&quot;, and one column for each character in sequence &quot;B&quot;. Thus, if aligning sequences of sizes &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, the amount of memory used is in formula_2. Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm only holds a subset of the array in memory and uses formula_3 space, but is otherwise similar to Needleman-Wunsch (and still requires formula_2 time).

As the algorithm progresses, the formula_1 will be assigned to be the optimal score for the alignment of the first formula_6 characters in &quot;A&quot; and the first formula_7 characters in &quot;B&quot;. The principle of optimality is then applied as follows:
* Basis:
:formula_8
:formula_9
* Recursion, based on the principle of optimality:
:formula_10

The pseudo-code for the algorithm to compute the F matrix therefore looks like this:
 d ← Gap penalty score
 for i = 0 to length(A)
 F(i,0) ← d * i
 for j = 0 to length(B)
 F(0,j) ← d * j
 for i = 1 to length(A)
 for j = 1 to length(B)
 Match ← F(i−1, j−1) + S(Ai, Bj)
 Delete ← F(i−1, j) + d
 Insert ← F(i, j−1) + d
 F(i,j) ← max(Match, Insert, Delete)
Once the &quot;F&quot; matrix is computed, the entry formula_11 gives the maximum score among all possible alignments. To compute an alignment that actually gives this score, you start from the bottom right cell, and compare the value with the three possible sources (Match, Insert, and Delete above) to see which it came from. If Match, then formula_12 and formula_13 are aligned, if Delete, then formula_12 is aligned with a gap, and if Insert, then formula_13 is aligned with a gap. (In general, more than one choice may have the same value, leading to alternative optimal alignments.)
 AlignmentA ← &quot;
 AlignmentB ← &quot;
 i ← length(A)
 j ← length(B)
 while (i &gt; 0 or j &gt; 0)
 if (i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 0 and F(i, j) == F(i−1, j−1) + S(Ai, Bj))
 AlignmentA ← Ai + AlignmentA
 AlignmentB ← Bj + AlignmentB
 i ← i − 1
 j ← j − 1
 else if (i &gt; 0 and F(i, j) == F(i−1, j) + d)
 AlignmentA ← Ai + AlignmentA
 AlignmentB ← &quot;−&quot; + AlignmentB
 i ← i − 1
 else
 AlignmentA ← &quot;−&quot; + AlignmentA
 AlignmentB ← Bj + AlignmentB
 j ← j − 1
 }

== Complexity ==
Computing the score formula_1 for each cell in the table is an formula_17 operation. Thus the time complexity of the algorithm for two sequences of length formula_18 and formula_19 is formula_20. It has been shown that it is possible to improve the running time to formula_21 using the Method of Four Russians. Since the algorithm fills an formula_22 table the space complexity is formula_23

==Historical notes and algorithm development==
The original purpose of the algorithm described by Needleman and Wunsch was to find similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins.

Needleman and Wunsch describe their algorithm explicitly for the case when the alignment is penalized solely by the matches and mismatches, and gaps have no penalty (&quot;d&quot;=0). The original publication from 1970 suggests the recursion
&lt;math&gt;F_{ij} = \max_{h.

The corresponding dynamic programming algorithm takes cubic time. The paper also points out that the recursion can accommodate arbitrary gap penalization formulas:
A penalty factor, a number subtracted for every gap made, may be assessed as a barrier to allowing the gap. The penalty factor could be a function of the size and/or direction of the gap. [page 444]
A better dynamic programming algorithm with quadratic running time for the same problem (no gap penalty) was introduced later by David Sankoff in 1972.
Similar quadratic-time algorithms were discovered independently
by T. K. Vintsyuk in 1968 for speech processing
(&quot;time warping&quot;), and by Robert A. Wagner and Michael J. Fischer in 1974 for string matching.

Needleman and Wunsch formulated their problem in terms of maximizing similarity. Another possibility is to minimize the edit distance between sequences, introduced by Vladimir Levenshtein. Peter H. Sellers showed in 1974 that the two problems are equivalent.

The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. However, the algorithm is expensive with respect to time and space, proportional to the product of the length of two sequences and hence is not suitable for long sequences.

Recent development has focused on improving the time and space cost of the algorithm while maintaining quality. For example, in 2013, a Fast Optimal Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm (FOGSAA), suggested alignment of nucleotide/protein sequences faster than other optimal global alignment methods, including the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm. The paper claims that when compared to the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm, FOGSAA achieves a time gain of 70–90% for highly similar nucleotide sequences (with &gt; 80% similarity), and 54–70% for sequences having 30–80% similarity.

==Applications outside bioinformatics==

===Computer stereo vision===

Stereo matching is an essential step in the process of 3D reconstruction from a pair of stereo images. When images have been rectified, an analogy can be drawn between aligning nucleotide and protein sequences and matching pixels belonging to scan lines, since both tasks aim at establishing optimal correspondence between two strings of characters. 

Although in many applications image rectification can be performed, e.g. by camera resectioning or calibration, it is sometimes impossible or impractical since the computational cost of accurate rectification models prohibit their usage in real-time applications. Moreover, none of these models is suitable when a camera lens displays unexpected distortions, such as those generated by raindrops, weatherproof covers or dust. By extending the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm, a line in the &#x27;left&#x27; image can be associated to a curve in the &#x27;right&#x27; image by finding the alignment with the highest score in a three-dimensional array (or matrix). Experiments demonstrated that such extension allows dense pixel matching between unrectified or distorted images.

<text>Huskvarna (; formerly spelled &quot;Husqvarna&quot;) constitutes the eastern part of Jönköping, a city in the Swedish province of Småland, and has a population of about 24,000. The distance to central Jönköping is about 5 km. The name Huskvarna translates to House Mill.

Between 1911 and 1970, it was a city municipality of its own. It geographically grew together with Jönköping in the 1950s. Since the local government reform in 1971, it is administratively within Jönköping Municipality.

==History==
A royal rifle manufacturer was established in Husqvarna, as it was originally spelled, in 1689, and lasted until 1757, when it was sold to private owners. It continued to supply the Swedish and Norwegian armies with rifles (for example, in 1870, some 10,000 rifles were finished), but the company later switched to the production of sewing machines and bicycles. Today, it is known as Husqvarna AB, a multinational company with a focus on gardening and outdoor tools.

==Coat of arms==
The arms (1911) depict rifles and their ignition.

==Sport==
The International Floorball Federation was founded in Huskvarna in 1986.

==Notable residents==
*Mona Johannesson, model
*Denni Avdić, association football player
*Emma Sjöberg, model
*Karin Alvtegen, author
*Gustaf Ankarcrona, painter

<doc id="1004706" wikidata="Q225957" url="?curid=1004706" title="Dysarthria">
<text>Dysarthria is a speech sound disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor–speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes. It is a condition in which problems effectively occur with the muscles that help produce speech, often making it very difficult to pronounce words. It is unrelated to problems with understanding language (that is, dysphasia or aphasia), although a person can have both. Any of the speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, resonance, prosody, and articulation) can be affected, leading to impairments in intelligibility, audibility, naturalness, and efficiency of vocal communication. Dysarthria that has progressed to a total loss of speech is referred to as anarthria. The term &quot;dysarthria&quot; was formed from the Greek components &quot;dys-&quot; &quot;dysfunctional, impaired&quot; and &quot;arthr-&quot; &quot;joint, vocal articulation&quot;.

Neurological injury due to damage in the central or peripheral nervous system may result in weakness, paralysis, or a lack of coordination of the motor–speech system, producing dysarthria. These effects in turn hinder control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing problems (dysphagia) are also often present in those with dysarthria. Cranial nerves that control the muscles relevant to dysarthria include the trigeminal nerve&#x27;s motor branch (V), the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), the vagus nerve (X), and the hypoglossal nerve (XII).

Dysarthria does not include speech disorders from structural abnormalities, such as cleft palate and must not be confused with apraxia of speech, which refers to problems in the planning and programming aspect of the motor–speech system. Just as the term &quot;articulation&quot; can mean either &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;joint movement&quot;, so is the combining form of &quot;&quot; the same in the terms &quot;dysarthria&quot;, &quot;dysarthrosis&quot;, and &quot;arthropathy&quot;; the term &quot;dysarthria&quot; is conventionally reserved for the speech problem and is not used to refer to arthropathy, whereas &quot;dysarthrosis&quot; has both senses but usually refers to arthropathy.

==Causes==
Various neurological and motor disorders can give rise to dysarthria. The main causes can be classified as genetic, infectious, toxic, traumatic, vascular, neoplastic, demyelinating, degenerative, or other.

* Genetic: Wilson&#x27;s disease, Tay–Sachs disease, and Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO syndrome) 
* Infectious: Lyme disease (borreliosis) and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD)
* Toxic: Heavy metal poisoning and Alcohol 
* Traumatic: Cerebral palsy (CP), Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)
* Vascular: Stroke and Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
* Neoplastic: Brain tumors
* Demyelinating: Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) 
* Degenerative: Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), Huntington&#x27;s disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Niemann-Pick disease (NP disease), and Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia (FRDA or FA)
* Other: Hypothermia, Hypoxic encephalopathy, Central pontine myelinolysis, and Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

These result in lesions to key areas of the brain involved in planning, executing, or regulating motor operations in skeletal muscles (i.e. muscles of the limbs), including muscles of the head and neck (dysfunction of which characterises dysarthria). These can result in dysfunction, or failure of: the motor or somatosensory cortex of the brain, corticobulbar pathways, the cerebellum, basal nuclei (consisting of the putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra etc.), brainstem (from which the cranial nerves originate), or the neuromuscular junction (in diseases such as myasthenia gravis) which block the nervous system&#x27;s ability to activate motor units and effect correct range and strength of movements.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Dysarthrias are classified in multiple ways based on the presentation of symptoms. Specific dysarthrias include spastic (resulting from bilateral damage to the upper motor neuron), flaccid (resulting from bilateral or unilateral damage to the lower motor neuron), ataxic (resulting from damage to cerebellum), unilateral upper motor neuron (presenting milder symptoms than bilateral UMN damage), hyperkinetic and hypokinetic (resulting from damage to parts of the basal ganglia, such as in Huntington&#x27;s disease or Parkinsonism), and the mixed dysarthrias (where symptoms of more than one type of dysarthria are present). The majority of people with dysarthric are diagnosed as having &#x27;mixed&#x27; dysarthria, as neural damage resulting in dysarthria is rarely contained to one part of the nervous system—for example, multiple strokes, traumatic brain injury, and some kinds of degenerative illnesses (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) usually damage many different sectors of the nervous system.

Ataxic dysarthria is an acquired neurological and sensorimotor speech deficit. It is a common diagnosis among the clinical spectrum of ataxic disorders. Since regulation of skilled movements is a primary function of the cerebellum, damage to the superior cerebellum and the superior cerebellar peduncle is believed to produce this form of dysarthria in ataxic patients. Growing evidence supports the likelihood of cerebellar involvement specifically affecting speech motor programming and execution pathways, producing the characteristic features associated with ataxic dysarthria. This link to speech motor control can explain the abnormalities in articulation and prosody, which are hallmarks of this disorder. Some of the most consistent abnormalities observed in patients with ataxia dysarthria are alterations of the normal timing pattern, with prolongation of certain segments and a tendency to equalize the duration of syllables when speaking. As the severity of the dysarthria increases, the patient may also lengthen more segments as well as increase the degree of lengthening of each individual segment.

Common clinical features of ataxic dysarthria include abnormalities in speech modulation, rate of speech, explosive or scanning speech, slurred speech, irregular stress patterns, and vocalic and consonantal misarticulations.

Ataxic dysarthria is associated with damage to the left cerebellar hemisphere in right-handed patients.

Dysarthria may affect a single system; however, it is more commonly reflected in multiple motor–speech systems. The etiology, degree of neuropathy, existence of co-morbidities, and the individual&#x27;s response all play a role in the effect the disorder has on the individual&#x27;s quality of life. Severity ranges from occasional articulation difficulties to verbal speech that is completely unintelligible.

Individuals with dysarthria may experience challenges in the following:
* Timing
* Vocal quality
* Pitch
* Volume
* Breath control
* Speed
* Strength
* Steadiness
* Range
* Tone

Examples of specific observations include a continuous breathy voice, irregular breakdown of articulation, monopitch, distorted vowels, word flow without pauses, and hypernasality.

==Treatment==
Articulation problems resulting from dysarthria are treated by speech language pathologists, using a variety of techniques. Techniques used depend on the effect the dysarthria has on control of the articulators. Traditional treatments target the correction of deficits in rate (of articulation), prosody (appropriate emphasis and inflection, affected e.g. by apraxia of speech, right hemisphere brain damage, etc.), intensity (loudness of the voice, affected e.g. in hypokinetic dysarthrias such as in Parkinson&#x27;s), resonance (ability to alter the vocal tract and resonating spaces for correct speech sounds) and phonation (control of the vocal folds for appropriate voice quality and valving of the airway). These treatments have usually involved exercises to increase strength and control over articulator muscles (which may be flaccid and weak, or overly tight and difficult to move), and using alternate speaking techniques to increase speaker intelligibility (how well someone&#x27;s speech is understood by peers). With the speech–language pathologist, there are several skills that are important to learn; safe chewing and swallowing techniques, avoiding conversations when feeling tired, repeat words and syllables over and over in order to learn the proper mouth movements, and techniques to deal with the frustration while speaking. Depending on the severity of the dysarthria, another possibility includes learning how to use a computer or flip cards in order to communicate more effectively.

More recent techniques based on the principles of motor learning (PML), such as LSVT (Lee Silverman voice treatment) speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve voice and speech function in PD. For Parkinson&#x27;s, aim to retrain speech skills through building new generalised motor programs, and attach great importance to regular practice, through peer/partner support and self-management. Regularity of practice, and when to practice, are the main issues in PML treatments, as they may determine the likelihood of generalization of new motor skills, and therefore how effective a treatment is.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices that make coping with a dysarthria easier include speech synthesis and text-based telephones. These allow people who are unintelligible, or may be in the later stages of a progressive illness, to continue to be able to communicate without the need for fully intelligible speech.

<doc id="1004708" wikidata="Q25172229" url="?curid=1004708" title="Marrow (vegetable)">
<text>A marrow is the mature fruit of certain &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; cultivars used as a vegetable. The immature fruit of the same or similar cultivars is called &quot;courgette&quot; (in Britain, Iran, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand) or &quot;zucchini&quot; (in North America, Japan, Australia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany and Austria). Like courgettes, marrows are oblong, green squash, but marrows have a firm rind and a neutral flavour, making them useful as edible casings for mincemeat and other stuffings. They can be stored for several weeks after harvest (like pumpkins and other winter squash), to be processed for food when required. They are a vegetable used in Great Britain and areas with significant British influence, though their popularity is waning in favor of immature summer squash like courgette.

Giant marrows are grown competitively in the United Kingdom, where the term &quot;marrow&quot; is often restricted to the striped, thick-skinned cultivar.

In a culinary context, marrows are a vegetable; usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment. Botanically, marrows are fruit, a type of botanical berry, being the swollen ovary of the marrow flower. Marrows, like all squash, have their ancestry in the Americas.

== History ==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first mention of vegetable marrows dates to 1822, zucchini to 1929, and courgettes to 1931. However, the word &quot;zucchini&quot; had already appeared in newspapers by 1916. Before the introduction of &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species from the New World, &quot;marrow&quot; signified the immature, edible fruits of &quot;Lagenaria&quot;, a cucurbit gourd of African origin widely grown since antiquity for eating when immature and for drying as watertight receptacles when grown to maturity.

Marrows are commonly cultivated in the British Isles, and the term &quot;marrow&quot; for the plant and for the fruit is current there, especially for the striped, thicker-skinned cultivar. However, both in North America (since the 1920s) and in Britain (since the 1960s), thinner-skinned immature marrows have gained popularity due to their tender skin and distinct flavour. Hedrick (1928) in his book &quot;The Vegetables of New York&quot;, describes the &quot;English Vegetable Marrow&quot; as &quot;one of the earliest forms of marrow squash grown, but has never been exceedingly popular in this country&quot;.

The fashion in Britain for eating immature marrows, called &quot;courgettes&quot; in British English, is relatively recent. Sudell (1966) does not mention courgettes, although he has a section on &quot;vegetable marrow&quot;, noting both trailing (vining) and bush types and saying &quot;cut when young&quot;. Witham Fogg (1966) wrote &quot;&quot;Courgettes&quot; These are really very tender baby marrows which have long been popular in France. ... Cooked and eaten with butter they form a very palatable dish.&quot; He devotes a page and a half to marrows and less than half a page to courgettes, which he clearly regards as something new to Britain.

The heaviest marrow on record weighed 116.4 kg (256 lb 9.8 oz) and was grown by Vincent Sjodin (UK) for entry in the CANNA UK National Giant Vegetables Championships, held at the Three Counties Showground in Malvern, Worcestershire, UK, on 23 September 2021.

== Nutrition ==
Marrows, like zucchini, are low in food energy (approximately per 100 g fresh marrow) and contain useful amounts of folate (24 μg/100 g), potassium (261 mg/100 g) and provitamin A (200 IU [10 RAE]/100 g).

== Toxicology ==
Members of the plant family Cucurbitaceae, which includes zucchini, marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can have high levels of cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilise edible cucurbitaceae – any such cross-fertilised seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions or irregular watering can stress the plant and favour the production of the toxin, which is not destroyed by cooking.

In August 2015, a 79-year-old German man and his wife ate a marrow grown by a neighbour. The couple noted the unusually bitter taste. Shortly afterwards they were both admitted to a Heidenheim hospital, apparently with symptoms of a gastrointestinal infection. The wife, who had eaten a smaller portion, survived, while the husband died. Toxicological analysis of the meal confirmed the presence of cucurbitacin.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Marrow Song&quot;, also known as &quot;Oh! What a Beauty&quot;, was a British song published on 16 December 1952, with words and music by Edrich Siebert. The innuendo-laden song was recorded for Decca by Billy Cotton and his Band with vocals by Alan Breeze and The Bandits on 1 December that year, under the title &quot;The Marrow Song (Oh What a Beauty)&quot;. As well as being issued on a single in January 1953, it was included on Cotton&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Saucy Songs&quot; EP. In 2013, the recording was featured in a UK television advertisement for the Co-operative supermarket. The song was performed in the 1969 film &quot;Kes&quot;. This version of The Marrow Song is used at several points in the 2024 video game &quot;Thank Goodness You&#x27;re Here!&quot; Marrows also play an important role in the 2005 animated film &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. In this film, the character of Gromit is devoted to growing a large marrow. The marrow is eventually destroyed when he uses it to lure the Were-Rabbit. The marrow also appears in the video game based on the film; Gromit can control the marrow&#x27;s growth by adjusting factors such as soil pH, greenhouse temperature, and water flow, as well as by purchasing fertilizers to increase its size.

Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective Hercule Poirot often expresses his desire to retire and grow marrows, accomplishing his dream briefly in &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;.

<text>Moon Maid is a fictional alien character from the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, created in 1964 by Chester Gould.

==Background==
Gould, hoping to keep the strip evolving with the times, slowly began changing the strip from a crime drama into one whose primary focus was science fiction. Tracy had always been equipped with the latest, most up-to-date police equipment, including forensic science, but with the introduction into the strip of eccentric industrialist Diet Smith as Tracy&#x27;s friend in the 1940s, Tracy began to use devices such as the two-way wrist radio, and later the two-way wrist TV.

The logical extension of this in Gould&#x27;s mind was the introduction of space travel. Smith invented the magnetic-powered Space Coupe. During 1963 Smith and another explorer landed on the moon three times to collect rock and soil samples. During the last visit they both leave the Space Coupe unattended. While returning to Earth they found a stow away on board, this was Moon Maid. Moon Maid had her debut to the world on January 1, 1964. The Moon race looked like Caucasian humans except for having abnormally large eyes and giraffe-like horns on their foreheads. Moon Maid&#x27;s first months on earth were chaotic, she could not speak earth language and her moon powers disrupted radar and television broadcasts as well as fried camera film. Her exploits continued with Junior falling in love with her and in a climatic moment this came to a head when it was revealed that Smith intended to take Moon Maid home. On April 7th, 1964 junior professes his love for Moon Maid and she decides to stay on earth with Junior.

When the impending 1969 NASA Apollo 11 Moon landing threatened to make the preceding Moon stories look silly, Gould chose to return to the material that made the Dick Tracy strip famous: Earthbound crime. The strip made one oblique reference to the Apollo 11 landing shortly after its completion, with Diet Smith commenting about some &quot;equipment left behind&quot; on the Moon (in a caption above a panel showing the abandoned Lunar Module).

After Apollo 11, Moon Maid and Honeymoon remained on Earth as wife and daughter of Tracy&#x27;s adopted son Dick Tracy, Junior. All references to their selenic origin were phased out, with Moon Maid identified solely as &quot;Junior&#x27;s wife&quot;. Both characters continued to appear sporadically, in greatly reduced roles, until Moon Maid&#x27;s eventual demise.

When Joe Staton and Mike Curtis took over the comic strip in 2011, they inaugurated a period in which many characters of the 1940s were reintroduced, including the Lunarian theme and the seeming reappearance of Moon Maid.

==Fictional character biography==
Moon Maid was the daughter of the Moon&#x27;s supreme ruler, a male humanoid who was always identified as &quot;the Governor of the Moon&quot;. It is not clear whether he was democratically elected, or some form of hereditary ruler. She served as a liaison between her race and the humans. She and her family became one of the strip&#x27;s primary focuses for several years.

Moon Maid eventually married Junior, the now-adult adopted son of Dick Tracy. Her father the Governor resented this marriage. Eventually, Moon Maid became pregnant by Junior. Her father was anxious that the child be born on the Moon, so as to be legally a Moon denizen. The pregnant Moon Maid, Junior, and the Governor and his wife were all aboard a Space Coupe when Moon Maid gave birth at precisely the midpoint in space between Earth and the Moon.

The child, a girl, was named Honeymoon Tracy and had slightly over-large eyes, and two prominent tufts of hair on her forehead in the position corresponding to Moon Maid&#x27;s horns; we are never told what lies beneath those tufts. The daughter also demonstrated a magnetic ability to attract small metal objects to her hands; this talent never played an important role in the strip.

During this period, Dick Tracy himself had many adventures on the Moon, notably solving a murder case involving a man named Purdy Fallar who kept two of his fingernails extra-long, claiming they were for harvesting the meat of Giant Escargot, a species of gigantic Moon snails, prized on Earth as delicacies. In reality he used his sharpened fingernails as throat-slashing weapons.

===Later years===
Soon after Rick Fletcher and Max Collins took over the strip in 1978, Moon Maid was murdered accidentally by a man named &quot;Little&quot; Littel in an attempt to kill Tracy with a car bomb while trying to collect on a million dollar open contract on Tracy&#x27;s head by elderly crime lord &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice. Littel would later be killed, himself, in an explosion when Junior Tracy goes to his shop looking for revenge on his wife&#x27;s murder.

Although Honeymoon Tracy survived—though all references to her Moon heritage were forgotten—it was understood that this moment represented the termination of the strip&#x27;s Moon years.

These themes returned to prominence in the 2010s. In August 2012 it was revealed (as Junior went to put flowers on her grave, in the anniversary of her death) that Moon Maid&#x27;s name was &quot;Mysta&quot; (a reference to 1940s comic character &quot;Mysta of the Moon&quot;). Shortly after, a female vigilante wearing a mask but sporting antennae and powers similar to Moon Maid&#x27;s stopped a mugging, an act that was covered by a reporter; this led to tensions in the Tracy family, who were positive that Moon Maid had died. She was mentioned as continuing to fight crime; however, one night she vandalized Moon Maid&#x27;s gravestone, claiming that it was a lie and that she was alive. She also displayed a desire to return with her family, i.e. Junior and Honeymoon, to the Moon. It was gradually revealed that she was in the care of a Dr. S. Tim Sail, an associate of Dr. Zy Gote (a geneticist who had previously claimed to have cloned the notorious criminal Mumbles, which eventually turned out to be a hoax).

Things came to head in the strips around September and October 2013, in which it was revealed that this Moon Maid is, in fact, an artificial chimera who via a combination of advanced plastic surgery (complete with solar cell horns that allowed her to mimic Moon Maid&#x27;s powers), Lunarian DNA grafting, and &quot;reprogramming&quot; through brainwashing techniques was made to believe that she was the real Moon Maid as part of a plan to steal the Space Coupe. She was, in fact, Glenna Ermine (a minor character of the strip in the 1960s); while accepting that she was not the original Moon Maid, she nonetheless refused an offer by Diet Smith to return her to Glenna&#x27;s original appearance, taking on the identity of &quot;Mysta Chimera&quot;. Diet Smith took the role of her guardian and father-figure, and she lives in an apartment in his combined corporate headquarters and factory.

The new Moon Maid has been occupied since in trying to reintegrate herself into the world and has maintained an amicable relationship with the Tracy family (especially Honeymoon, who feels that they share a common Lunarian heritage). Recently, it has been noticed by Smith that her Lunarian DNA has begun to evolve (to the point that she is developing natural powers). This was recently followed by the discovery that Honeymoon has been developing Lunarian antennae and some Lunarian abilities, signs that her own half-Lunarian ancestry is developing.

A story in 2015 featured a crossover in which Honeymoon Tracy met Little Orphan Annie.

<text>The Torch Theatre was a theatre located in Capel Street, Dublin, which operated from 1935 to 1941.

==Establishment==
The Torch Theatre was founded by husband and wife team Charles L. Keogh and Evelyn Lund and opened on February 27, 1935. The building had previously been used as the headquarters of the United Trades Council, with the meeting room being converted into the theatre space. Another founding member was the artist Lilian Davidson, who under the stage name &quot;Jennifer Maud&quot;, designed scenery and was a co-director in 1936.

==Associations==
The semi-professional company that was based out of the Torch Theatre specialised in productions of melodrama and opened with a production of &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot;. The production later focused less on melodrama and more on light theatre, pantomime and comedies. Other plays the theatre produced were &quot;A Royal Divorce&quot;, &quot;In Memory of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot;, and &quot;Arrah-na-Pogue&quot;. Some of the actors who took part in these productions were F. J. McCormick, Eve Panton, and Harry Brogan. In 1936 Cyril Cusack directed and set designed a season of Irish language plays.

==Closure==
The theatre was largely unprofitable and operated sporadically until 1941. The final production was a revue &quot;Sensations of 1940&quot;, directed by Dan Rockford. There is now a preservation order on the facade of the building.

<doc id="1004729" wikidata="Q205058" url="?curid=1004729" title="Masaru Emoto">
<text>was a Japanese businessman, author and pseudoscientist who claimed that human consciousness could affect the molecular structure of water. His 2004 book &quot;The Hidden Messages in Water&quot; was a New York Times best seller. His ideas had evolved over the years, and his early work revolved around pseudoscientific hypotheses that water could react to positive thoughts and words and that polluted water could be cleaned through prayer and positive visualization.

Starting in 1999, Emoto published several volumes of a work entitled &quot;Messages from Water&quot;, containing photographs of ice crystals and accompanying experiments such as that of the &quot;rice in water 30 day experiment.&quot;

==Biography==
Emoto was born in Yokohama and graduated from Yokohama Municipal University after taking courses in International Relations. He worked in the Nagoya Office (Central Japan Office) of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, then founded the International Health Medical company in 1986. In 1989, he received exclusive rights to market the Magnetic Resonance Analyzer, a device patented by Ronald Weinstock (Patent 5,592,086), which was alleged to be able to detect the magnetic field around a human hair, for example, and diagnose almost any disease. He renamed it the &quot;Vibration-o-Meter,&quot; became an operator himself, and started a business dealing in vibrations.

He was President Emeritus of the International Water For Life Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City in the United States. In 1992, he became a Doctor of Alternative Medicine at the Open International University for Alternative Medicine in India, a fraudulent college which targeted quacks to sell degrees and was later shut down.

==Ideas==
Emoto claimed that water was a &quot;blueprint for our reality&quot; and that emotional &quot;energies&quot; and &quot;vibrations&quot; could change its physical structure. His water crystal experiments consisted of exposing water in glasses to various words, pictures, or music, then freezing it and examining the ice crystals&#x27; aesthetic properties with microscopic photography. He claimed that water exposed to positive speech and thoughts created visually &quot;pleasing&quot; ice crystals, and that negative intentions yielded &quot;ugly&quot; ice formations.

Emoto held that different water sources produced different ice structures. For example, he held that water from a mountain stream, when frozen, showed structures of beautifully shaped geometric designs; but that water from polluted sources created distorted, randomly formed ice structures. He held that these changes could be eliminated by exposing water to ultraviolet light or certain electromagnetic waves.

==Reception==
In 2008, Emoto published his findings in the &quot;Journal of Scientific Exploration&quot;, a journal of the Society for Scientific Exploration that has been criticized for catering to fringe science. He co-conducted and co-authored the work with Takashige Kizu of Emoto&#x27;s own International Health Medical (IHM) General Institute, and Dean Radin and Nancy Lund of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, which is on Stephen Barrett&#x27;s Quackwatch list of questionable organizations.

Commentators have criticized Emoto for insufficient experimental controls and for not sharing enough details of his experiments with the scientific community. He has also been criticized for designing his experiments in ways that permit manipulation or human error. Biochemist and Director of Microscopy at University College Cork William Reville wrote, &quot;It is very unlikely that there is any reality behind Emoto&#x27;s claims.&quot; Reville noted the lack of scientific publication and pointed out that anyone who could demonstrate such phenomena would become immediately famous and probably wealthy.

Writing about Emoto&#x27;s ideas in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, physician Harriet A. Hall concluded that it was &quot;hard to see how anyone could mistake it for science&quot;. In 2003, James Randi published an invitation on his website, offering Emoto to take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, in which Emoto could have received US$1,000,000 if he had been able to reproduce the experiment under test conditions agreed to by both parties. Randi did not receive a response.

Emoto&#x27;s book &quot;The Hidden Messages in Water&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller. Writing in &quot;The New York Times Book Review,&quot; literary critic Dwight Garner described it as &quot;spectacularly eccentric&quot;, and said its success was &quot;one of those &#x27;head-scratchers&#x27; that makes me question the sanity of the reading public.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described Emoto&#x27;s later work, &quot;The Shape of Love&quot;, as &quot;mostly incoherent and unsatisfying&quot;.

Emoto&#x27;s ideas appeared in the movies &quot;Kamen Rider: The First&quot; and &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot;

<text>In statistics and related fields, a similarity measure or similarity function or similarity metric is a real-valued function that quantifies the similarity between two objects. Although no single definition of a similarity exists, usually such measures are in some sense the inverse of distance metrics: they take on large values for similar objects and either zero or a negative value for very dissimilar objects. Though, in more broad terms, a similarity function may also satisfy metric axioms.

Cosine similarity is a commonly used similarity measure for real-valued vectors, used in (among other fields) information retrieval to score the similarity of documents in the vector space model. In machine learning, common kernel functions such as the RBF kernel can be viewed as similarity functions.

==Use of different similarity measure formulas==
Different types of similarity measures exist for various types of objects, depending on the objects being compared. For each type of object there are various similarity measurement formulas.

Similarity between two data points

There are many various options available when it comes to finding similarity between two data points, some of which are a combination of other similarity methods. Some of the methods for similarity measures between two data points include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, and Chebyshev distance. The Euclidean distance formula is used to find the distance between two points on a plane, which is visualized in the image below. Manhattan distance is commonly used in GPS applications, as it can be used to find the shortest route between two addresses.
When you generalize the Euclidean distance formula and Manhattan distance formula you are left with the Minkowski distance formulas, which can be used in a wide variety of applications.

* Manhattan distance 
* Minkowski distance
* Chebyshev distance

Similarity between strings

For comparing strings, there are various measures of string similarity that can be used. Some of these methods include edit distance, Levenshtein distance, Hamming distance, and Jaro distance. The best-fit formula is dependent on the requirements of the application. For example, edit distance is frequently used for natural language processing applications and features, such as spell-checking. Jaro distance is commonly used in record linkage to compare first and last names to other sources.

* Edit distance
* Levenshtein distance
* Lee distance
* Hamming distance
* Jaro distance

Similarity between two probability distributions

Typical measures of similarity for probability distributions are the Bhattacharyya distance and the Hellinger distance. Both provide a quantification of similarity for two probability distributions on the same domain, and they are mathematically closely linked. The Bhattacharyya distance does not fulfill the triangle inequality, meaning it does not form a metric. The Hellinger distance does form a metric on the space of probability distributions.

* Bhattacharyya distance
* Hellinger distance

Similarity between two sets

The Jaccard index formula measures the similarity between two sets based on the number of items that are present in both sets relative to the total number of items. It is commonly used in recommendation systems and social media analysis. The Sørensen–Dice coefficient also compares the number of items in both sets to the total number of items present but the weight for the number of shared items is larger. The Sørensen–Dice coefficient is commonly used in biology applications, measuring the similarity between two sets of genes or species.

* Sørensen–Dice coefficient

Similarity between two sequences

When comparing temporal sequences (time series), some similarity measures must additionally account for similarity of two sequences that are not fully aligned.

* Dynamic time warping

==Use in clustering==
Clustering or Cluster analysis is a data mining technique that is used to discover patterns in data by grouping similar objects together. It involves partitioning a set of data points into groups or clusters based on their similarities. One of the fundamental aspects of clustering is how to measure similarity between data points.

Similarity measures play a crucial role in many clustering techniques, as they are used to determine how closely related two data points are and whether they should be grouped together in the same cluster. A similarity measure can take many different forms depending on the type of data being clustered and the specific problem being solved.

One of the most commonly used similarity measures is the Euclidean distance, which is used in many clustering techniques including K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering. The Euclidean distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a high-dimensional space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points. For example, if we have two data points formula_1 and formula_2, the Euclidean distance between them is formula_3.
Another commonly used similarity measure is the Jaccard index or Jaccard similarity, which is used in clustering techniques that work with binary data such as presence/absence data or Boolean data; The Jaccard similarity is particularly useful for clustering techniques that work with text data, where it can be used to identify clusters of similar documents based on their shared features or keywords. It is calculated as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets: formula_4.

Similarities among 162 Relevant Nuclear Profile are tested using the Jaccard Similarity measure (see figure with heatmap). The Jaccard similarity of the nuclear profile ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no similarity between the two sets and 1 indicating perfect similarity with the aim of clustering the most similar nuclear profile.

Manhattan distance, also known as Taxicab geometry, is a commonly used similarity measure in clustering techniques that work with continuous data. It is a measure of the distance between two data points in a high-dimensional space, calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points formula_5.

When dealing with mixed-type data, including nominal, ordinal, and numerical attributes per object, Gower&#x27;s distance (or similarity) is a common choice as it can handle different types of variables implicitly. It first computes similarities between the pair of variables in each object, and then combines those similarities to a single weighted average per object-pair. As such, for two objects formula_6 and formula_7 having formula_8 descriptors, the similarity formula_9 is defined as: formula_10 where the formula_11 are non-negative weights and formula_12 is the similarity between the two objects regarding their formula_13-th variable.

In spectral clustering, a similarity, or affinity, measure is used to transform data to overcome difficulties related to lack of convexity in the shape of the data distribution. The measure gives rise to an formula_14-sized for a set of points, where the entry formula_15 in the matrix can be simply the (reciprocal of the) Euclidean distance between formula_6 and formula_7, or it can be a more complex measure of distance such as the Gaussian formula_18. Further modifying this result with network analysis techniques is also common.

The choice of similarity measure depends on the type of data being clustered and the specific problem being solved. For example, working with continuous data such as gene expression data, the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity may be appropriate. If working with binary data such as the presence of a genomic loci in a nuclear profile, the Jaccard index may be more appropriate. Lastly, working with data that is arranged in a grid or lattice structure, such as image or signal processing data, the Manhattan distance is particularly useful for the clustering.

==Use in recommender systems==

Similarity measures are used to develop recommender systems. It observes a user&#x27;s perception and liking of multiple items. On recommender systems, the method is using a distance calculation such as &#x27; or &#x27; to generate a with values representing the similarity of any pair of targets. Then, by analyzing and comparing the values in the matrix, it is possible to match two targets to a user&#x27;s preference or link users based on their marks. In this system, it is relevant to observe the value itself and the absolute distance between two values. Gathering this data can indicate a mark&#x27;s likeliness to a user as well as how mutually closely two marks are either rejected or accepted. It is possible then to recommend to a user targets with high similarity to the user&#x27;s likes.

Recommender systems are observed in multiple online entertainment platforms, in social media and streaming websites. The logic for the construction of this systems is based on similarity measures.

==Use in sequence alignment==

Similarity matrices are used in sequence alignment. Higher scores are given to more-similar characters, and lower or negative scores for dissimilar characters.

Nucleotide similarity matrices are used to align nucleic acid sequences. Because there are only four nucleotides commonly found in DNA (Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T)), nucleotide similarity matrices are much simpler than protein similarity matrices. For example, a simple matrix will assign identical bases a score of +1 and non-identical bases a score of −1. A more complicated matrix would give a higher score to transitions (changes from a pyrimidine such as C or T to another pyrimidine, or from a purine such as A or G to another purine) than to transversions (from a pyrimidine to a purine or vice versa).
The match/mismatch ratio of the matrix sets the target evolutionary distance. The +1/−3 DNA matrix used by BLASTN is best suited for finding matches between sequences that are 99% identical; a +1/−1 (or +4/−4) matrix is much more suited to sequences with about 70% similarity. Matrices for lower similarity sequences require longer sequence alignments.

Amino acid similarity matrices are more complicated, because there are 20 amino acids coded for by the genetic code, and so a larger number of possible substitutions. Therefore, the similarity matrix for amino acids contains 400 entries (although it is usually symmetric). The first approach scored all amino acid changes equally. A later refinement was to determine amino acid similarities based on how many base changes were required to change a codon to code for that amino acid. This model is better, but it doesn&#x27;t take into account the selective pressure of amino acid changes. Better models took into account the chemical properties of amino acids.

One approach has been to empirically generate the similarity matrices. The Dayhoff method used phylogenetic trees and sequences taken from species on the tree. This approach has given rise to the PAM series of matrices. PAM matrices are labelled based on how many nucleotide changes have occurred, per 100 amino acids. 
While the PAM matrices benefit from having a well understood evolutionary model, they are most useful at short evolutionary distances (PAM10–PAM120). At long evolutionary distances, for example PAM250 or 20% identity, it has been shown that the BLOSUM matrices are much more effective.

The BLOSUM series were generated by comparing a number of divergent sequences. The BLOSUM series are labeled based on how much entropy remains unmutated between all sequences, so a lower BLOSUM number corresponds to a higher PAM number.

<doc id="1004747" wikidata="Q124236" url="?curid=1004747" title="Paul Scherrer">
<text>Paul Hermann Scherrer (3 February 1890 – 25 September 1969) was a Swiss physicist. Born in St. Gallen, Switzerland, he studied at Göttingen, Germany, before becoming a lecturer there. Later, Scherrer became head of the Department of Physics at ETH Zurich.

==Early life and studies==
Paul Scherrer was born in St. Gallen. In 1908, he enrolled at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (later known as ETH Zurich), changing course from Botany to Mathematics and Physics after two semesters. In 1912, Scherrer spent one semester at Königsberg University, then undertook further studies at the University of Göttingen, graduating from there with a doctorate on the Faraday effect in the hydrogen molecule. In 1916, while still working on his dissertation, he and his tutor, Peter Debye, developed the “Debye–Scherrer powder method”, a procedure using X-rays for the structural analysis of crystals. This made an important contribution to the development of the scattering techniques that are still used in the large facilities at the Paul Scherrer Institute to this day. Debye received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work in 1936.

He is perhaps best known for determining the inverse relationship between the width of an X-ray diffraction peak and the crystallite size. This work was published in 1918.

ETH Zurich appointed Scherrer to the post of Professor of Experimental Physics in 1920, at the early age of 30. In 1925, he organised the first international conference of physicists to take place after the First World War. He became Principal of the Physical Institute at ETH in 1927 and focused its direction on nuclear physics, a research branch that was still coming into being at that stage. The first cyclotron at ETH Zurich was built under his direction in 1940.

==Nuclear and atomic physics==
Beginning in late 1944, Scherrer became close to Moe Berg and, through Berg, gave the United States information about German science and German scientists, especially related to efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Scherrer later became the foremost proponent of Switzerland developing its own nuclear weapons with enriched uranium supplied by Belgian Congo, a program which was pursued by the government for 43 years and abandoned in 1988 by Arnold Koller, then member of the Swiss Federal Council and head of the Swiss military department.

In parallel with his main professional occupation as a researcher and leader of an institution, Paul Scherrer also served in various institutions and committees involved in the dissemination of nuclear energy in Switzerland: the Swiss Federal Council appointed him to the post of President of the Swiss Study Commission on Atomic Energy (&quot;Schweizerischen Studienkommission für Atomenergie)&quot; in 1946, and President of the Swiss Commission for Atomic Sciences in 1958.

In addition, Scherrer took part in establishing CERN near Geneva in 1952–54. When established he became one of the original members of the Scientific Policy Committee, at which he served until the end of 1963, and the CERN Council. Furthermore, he participated in setting up Reaktor AG, to study the construction and operation of nuclear fission facilities one year later, in Würenlingen.

His abilities and foresight led to the early development of new branches of solid-state physics, particle physics and electronics, which made a vital contribution to the high standard of research at Swiss universities. When Scherrer was made emeritus professor in 1960, after 40 years at ETH Zurich, he took up a teaching appointment at the University of Basel and his former students and friends put together a Festschrift.

==Private life==

In 1922 Scherrer married Ina Sonderegger, with whom he had two daughters.

He died on 25 September 1969 after a horse-riding accident.

==Legacy==

The eponymous Paul Scherrer Institute, based near Villigen in canton of Aargau, was established on 1 January 1988 by merging the 1960 established EIR (&quot;Eidgenössisches Institut für Reaktorforschung&quot;, Federal Institute for Reactor Research) and the 1968 established SIN (&quot;Schweizerisches Institut für Nuklearphysik&quot;, Swiss Institute for Nuclear Physics) with Jean-Pierre Blaser (SIN founder) named its first director.

There is a street, Route Scherrer, named after Scherrer at CERN, Geneva.

<doc id="1004751" wikidata="Q109960" url="?curid=1004751" title="Magister equitum">
<text>The , in English Master of the Horse or Master of the Cavalry, was a Roman magistrate appointed as lieutenant to a dictator. His nominal function was to serve as commander of the Roman cavalry in time of war, but just as a dictator could be nominated to respond to other crises, so the &quot;magister equitum&quot; could operate independently of the cavalry; like the dictator, the appointment of a &quot;magister equitum&quot; served both military and political purposes.

==Origin==
In the time of the Roman Kingdom, the king himself would lead the cavalry into battle, or else delegate this authority to his chief advisor, the Tribune of the Celeres, the cavalry unit that also served as the king&#x27;s personal bodyguard. The last person to hold this position was Lucius Junius Brutus, nephew of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and final King of Rome. After the rape of Lucretia, it was Brutus who, in his capacity as Tribune of the Celeres, convened the &quot;comitia&quot;, and brought about the abrogation of the king&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot;. Following the expulsion of Tarquin, Brutus, whom the comitia elected one of the first consuls, commanded the cavalry in the Battle of Silva Arsia, where he fell, BC 509.

In the early years of the Republic, no attempt was made to reconstitute the office of Tribune of the Celeres; the supreme military authority was vested in the consuls. In keeping with the principle that no one man should hold the full power of the Roman state, it was possible to appeal the decisions of one consul to the other. But in the ninth year of the Republic, war appeared imminent with both the Latin League, led by the exiled king&#x27;s son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, and the Sabines, with whom the Romans had fought in both 505 and 503 BC. At the same time, there was suspicion that the consuls harbored royalist sympathies. In the face of this panic, the Romans resolved to appoint a &quot;praetor maximus&quot;, or &quot;dictator&quot;, as the office came to be called, from whom there should be no right of appeal, for the duration of the emergency.

Whether in spite of or &quot;because&quot; of the rumors circulating about the consuls, the consul Titus Lartius Flavus was nominated the first dictator, and Spurius Cassius Vecellinus the first &quot;magister equitum&quot;. Alarmed by this development, the Sabines sent envoys to Rome to negotiate peace, while the Latins were not yet ready for war, and thus the dictator and &quot;magister equitum&quot; were able to lay down their office without taking the field.

==Nature of the office==
The powers of the ancient Tribune of the Celeres were thus divided and limited from the institution of the dictatorship. Although the dictator commanded the entire army, his technical title was &quot;magister populi&quot;, or &quot;master of the infantry&quot;, while the cavalry was entrusted to his lieutenant. Unlike the relationship between consuls, who shared equal authority, the magister equitum was always subordinate to the dictator. Although history does not record whether the first &quot;magister equitum&quot; was nominated by the dictator, in subsequent practice a magister equitum was nearly always chosen by the dictator under whom he served. The dictator retained the power to dismiss the &quot;magister equitum&quot;, and to appoint a replacement. Once the emergency for which the dictator was nominated had passed, or the expiration of six months, the dictator was compelled to lay down his office, and when he did so, the &quot;imperium&quot; of the &quot;magister equitum&quot; likewise expired.

Although the original function of the dictator was to lead the Roman army in time of war, a dictator was sometimes nominated for the purpose of holding elections, restoring order, or performing vital religious functions, when it was impossible for the consuls or other magistrates to do so. In these cases, it was still customary for the dictator to appoint a &quot;magister equitum&quot; to serve as his lieutenant. Even when the Roman army was in the field, the dictator might choose to divide his command, taking the field while relying on the &quot;magister equitum&quot; as his deputy in Rome, or sending the &quot;magister equitum&quot; into the field, allowing the dictator to remain at Rome.

Like other magistrates, the &quot;magister equitum&quot; was entitled to wear the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, sit in the &quot;sella curulis,&quot; and he was escorted by six lictors, a ceremonial bodyguard awarded to magistrates with &quot;imperium&quot;, and certain other persons. This was half the number of lictors to which the consuls were entitled, and the same number accorded to the praetors after the institution of that magistracy in 366 BC. As with other magistrates, the lictors of the &quot;magister equitum&quot; were expected to remove the axes from their fasces when entering the Pomerium, an area of the city of Rome that was considered sacred. Only the lictors of the dictator, who was entitled to an escort of twenty-four lictors, representing the full authority of the Roman state, retained their axes within the Pomerium, symbolizing that the dictator retained the power of life and death, even within Rome&#x27;s sacred precinct.

==History==
Before the institution of the praetorship, it was common for the &quot;magister equitum&quot; to be someone who had already served as consul or consular tribune. In this way, the magistracy was held by someone who had prior experience with military command. For those who had yet to achieve the highest offices of the Roman state, this appointment was a valuable stepping stone toward those offices. In the later republic, it was common for the &quot;magister equitum&quot; to be chosen from men of praetorian rank; that is, from those who had held the praetorship, but who had not yet been elected consul.

Through the course of the fourth century BC, which saw the institution of the praetorship and the admission of the plebeians to the higher offices of state, the need to resort to extraordinary magistrates such as the dictator and &quot;magister equitum&quot; for military emergencies declined, and they were increasingly employed for ceremonial purposes. By 300, even the power of the dictator was subject to &quot;provocatio&quot;, the right of appeal by a Roman citizen. Few of the dictators appointed during the third century were sent into the field, and thus the office of &quot;magister equitum&quot; was increasingly redundant. The last dictator to take the field was Marcus Junius Pera in 216 BC, during the Second Punic War, with Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus as his master of the horse.

During the remainder of the war, dictators were regularly appointed to hold the elections for annual magistrates. Although each nominated a &quot;magister equitum&quot;, none of them held an independent command, or led the army in the field. No dictator was appointed in the traditional manner after 202 BC, and with it the office of &quot;magister equitum&quot; fell dormant.

In 82 BC, the victorious general Sulla entered Rome after defeating the Marian forces, and at his urging the &quot;interrex&quot;, Lucius Valerius Flaccus convinced the &quot;comitia&quot; to appoint Sulla dictator for the purpose of restoring order. Sulla had thus revived the office of dictator, and with it, the position of &quot;magister equitum&quot;. In gratitude, Sulla appointed Flaccus master of the horse, although he seems to have conducted no military activity. Sulla and Flaccus continued in office until laying down their authority in 79.

On the outbreak of war between Caesar and Pompeius in 49 BC, Caesar was appointed dictator for purposes of holding the elections; no &quot;magister equitum&quot; was nominated. Dictator for the second time in 47, Caesar nominated Marcus Antonius his master of the horse; in the course of the same year, Caesar appointed Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to that honour. In his third dictatorship, BC 45, Caesar&#x27;s &quot;magister equitum&quot; was Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. The following year, Caesar was once again invested with the dictatorship, with Lepidus his master of the horse.

Lepidus was the last &quot;magister equitum&quot; to hold military command, although he was neither the last nominated nor the last initiated; with the intention of beginning a new campaign in the autumn of 43, Caesar nominated his nephew, Gaius Octavius, &quot;magister equitum&quot; in advance, making the future emperor the last master of the horse to enter into office, although he never received his command. Meanwhile, Caesar had nominated Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus magister equitum for 43, but the dictator&#x27;s murder on the Ides of March, 44 BC, occurred before Domitius could be initiated.

With the consolidation of power first under the triumvirate of Octavian, Antonius, and Lepidus, and then in the person of Octavian alone, no further dictators were appointed. Following Caesar&#x27;s death, Antonius promulgated a law abolishing the office. Octavian was careful to clothe his assumption of power in a constitutional form, and although his power as Augustus in many ways exceeded that of a Roman dictator, he never assumed that title or the symbols of the office. His successors followed his example; even when they assumed the powers of a dictator, they never assumed the title or appointed a master of the horse. Thus, the ancient title of &quot;magister equitum&quot; also fell once more into abeyance.

In the fourth century AD, the emperor Constantine revived the title as one of his senior military ranks in an effort to reduce the power of the praetorian prefects, creating the military office of the &quot;magister peditum,&quot; &quot;master of the foot&quot; or &quot;master of the infantry&quot;. These positions were eventually amalgamated under the title of &quot;magister militum&quot;, or &quot;master of the soldiers.&quot; Both roles continued to be used as military administrators of Byzantine praetorian prefectures.

<text>Sir William Watson (2 August 185811 August 1935) was an English poet, popular in his time for the celebratory content, and famous for the controversial political content, of his verse. Initially popularly recognised, he was then neglected because of changing tastes.

==Poet==
Watson was born in Burley, in present-day West Yorkshire, and was brought up in Liverpool, where his father had moved for business. In 1880 he published his first book, &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Quest&quot;, a poem showing the influence of Keats and Tennyson. It was republished in 1893. In 1884 appeared &quot;Epigrams of Art, Life and Nature&quot;, which already showed the mature Watson&#x27;s characteristic restraint and concision.

He became a prolific poet of the 1890s, and a contributor to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, though without &quot;decadent&quot; associations, and on the traditionalist wing of English poetry. His reputation was established in 1891, with the publication of &quot;Wordsworth&#x27;s Grave&quot;, and the appearance in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;, August 1891, of an article by Grant Allen entitled &quot;A New Poet.&quot; On the occasion of Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s death in 1892, he was a strong candidate to be his eulogist, the commission resulting in his &quot;Lachrymae Musarum&quot; (in a book by that name that also contained other poems). He suffered a breakdown later in 1892 and was passed over for the position of Poet Laureate in favour of Alfred Austin. Still, Prime Minister Gladstone bestowed on him the Civil List pension of £200 available on the death of Tennyson.

Watson regained his standing in 1894 with the publication of &quot;Odes and other poems&quot;, which included &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;, expressing gratitude for his recovery. He courted controversy later in the decade with an attack on Turkey (&quot;The Purple East&quot;, 1896) and then later again with anti-Boer War poems. Although his politics were unpopular during these years, he was still regarded as a sincere and passionate poet, and in 1903 he produced a collection of poems contributed to various periodicals and called &quot;For England: Poems Written During Estrangement&quot;, a poetical defence of his impugned patriotism during the Boer War.

After Austin&#x27;s death in 1913, Prime Minister Asquith considered him for the laureateship, despite the fact that he had written a cruel pasquil against his wife Margot Asquith (&quot;She is not old, she is not young / The woman with the serpent&#x27;s tongue&quot;); but because of the contentious nature of his political poems, he was again passed over, this time for Robert Bridges. Perhaps in exchange for writing a panegyric of Lloyd George, or perhaps because of his support of the Great War effort, he was awarded a knighthood in 1917.

After World War I Watson was largely forgotten. A number of literary men in 1935 issued a public appeal for a fund to support him in his old age; he died the same year. He is buried in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Childwall, Liverpool

==Family==
Watson married Adeline Maureen Pring in 1909; they had two daughters.

<doc id="1004764" wikidata="Q5521761" url="?curid=1004764" title="Gap penalty">
<text>A Gap penalty is a method of scoring alignments of two or more sequences. When aligning sequences, introducing gaps in the sequences can allow an alignment algorithm to match more terms than a gap-less alignment can. However, minimizing gaps in an alignment is important to create a useful alignment. Too many gaps can cause an alignment to become meaningless. Gap penalties are used to adjust alignment scores based on the number and length of gaps. The five main types of gap penalties are constant, linear, affine, convex, and profile-based.

== Applications ==

* Genetic sequence alignment - In bioinformatics, gaps are used to account for genetic mutations occurring from insertions or deletions in the sequence, sometimes referred to as &quot;indels&quot;. Insertions or deletions can occur due to single mutations, unbalanced crossover in meiosis, slipped strand mispairing, and chromosomal translocation. The notion of a gap in an alignment is important in many biological applications, since the insertions or deletions comprise an entire sub-sequence and often occur from a single mutational event. Furthermore, single mutational events can create gaps of different sizes. Therefore, when scoring, the gaps need to be scored as a whole when aligning two sequences of DNA. Considering multiple gaps in a sequence as a larger single gap will reduce the assignment of a high cost to the mutations. For instance, two protein sequences may be relatively similar but differ at certain intervals as one protein may have a different subunit compared to the other. Representing these differing sub-sequences as gaps will allow us to treat these cases as “good matches” even though there are long consecutive runs with indel operations in the sequence. Therefore, using a good gap penalty model will avoid low scores in alignments and improve the chances of finding a true alignment. In genetic sequence alignments, gaps are represented as dashes(-) on a protein/DNA sequence alignment.
* Unix &quot;diff&quot; function - computes the minimal difference between two files similarly to plagiarism detection.
* Spell checking - Gap penalties can help find correctly spelled words with the shortest edit distance to a misspelled word. Gaps can indicate a missing letter in the incorrectly spelled word.
* Plagiarism detection - Gap penalties allow algorithms to detect where sections of a document are plagiarized by placing gaps in original sections and matching what is identical. The gap penalty for a certain document quantifies how much of a given document is probably original or plagiarized.

== Bioinformatics applications ==
=== Global alignment ===

A global alignment performs an end-to-end alignment of the query sequence with the reference sequence. Ideally, this alignment technique is most suitable for closely related sequences of similar lengths. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to conduct global alignment. Essentially, the algorithm divides the problem into a set of sub-problems, then uses the results of the sub-problems to reconstruct a solution to the original query.

=== Semi-global alignment ===
The use of semi-global alignment exists to find a particular match within a large sequence. An example includes seeking promoters within a DNA sequence. Unlike global alignment, it compromises of no end gaps in one or both sequences. If the end gaps are penalized in one sequence 1 but not in sequence 2, it produces an alignment that contains sequence 2 within sequence 1.

=== Local alignment ===
A local sequence alignment matches a contiguous sub-section of one sequence with a contiguous sub-section of another. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is motivated by giving scores for matches and mismatches. Matches increase the overall score of an alignment whereas mismatches decrease the score. A good alignment then has a positive score and a poor alignment has a negative score. The local algorithm finds an alignment with the highest score by considering only alignments that score positives and picking the best one from those. The algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm. When comparing proteins, one uses a similarity matrix which assigns a score to each possible residue pair. The score should be positive for similar residues and negative for dissimilar residue pairs. Gaps are usually penalized using a linear gap function that assigns an initial penalty for a gap opening, and an additional penalty for gap extensions, increasing the gap length.

=== Scoring matrix ===
Substitution matrices such as BLOSUM are used for sequence alignment of proteins. A Substitution matrix assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. In general, different substitution matrices are tailored to detecting similarities among sequences that are diverged by differing degrees. A single matrix may be reasonably efficient over a relatively broad range of evolutionary change.
The BLOSUM-62 matrix is one of the best substitution matrices for detecting weak protein similarities. BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences. For example, BLOSUM-80 is used for alignments that are more similar in sequence, and BLOSUM-45 is used for alignments that have diverged from each other. For particularly long and weak alignments, the BLOSUM-45 matrix may provide the best results. Short alignments are more easily detected using a matrix with a higher &quot;relative entropy&quot; than that of BLOSUM-62. The BLOSUM series does not include any matrices with relative entropies suitable for the shortest queries.

=== Indels ===

During DNA replication, the cellular replication machinery is prone to making two types of errors while duplicating the DNA. These two replication errors are insertions and deletions of single DNA bases from the DNA strand (indels). Indels can have severe biological consequences by causing mutations in the DNA strand that could result in the inactivation or over activation of the target protein. For example, if a one or two nucleotide indel occurs in a coding sequence the result will be a shift in the reading frame, or a frameshift mutation that may render the protein inactive. The biological consequences of indels are often deleterious and are frequently associated with pathologies such as cancer. However, not all indels are frameshift mutations. If indels occur in trinucleotides, the result is an extension of the protein sequence that may also have implications on protein function.

==Types==
=== Constant ===
This is the simplest type of gap penalty: a fixed negative score is given to every gap, regardless of its length. This encourages the algorithm to make fewer, larger, gaps leaving larger contiguous sections.

 ATTGACCTGA
 AT---CCTGA

Aligning two short DNA sequences, with &#x27;-&#x27; depicting a gap of one base pair. If each match was worth 1 point and the whole gap -1, the total score: 7 − 1 = 6.

=== Linear ===
Compared to the constant gap penalty, the linear gap penalty takes into account the length (L) of each insertion/deletion in the gap. Therefore, if the penalty for each inserted/deleted element is B and the length of the gap L; the total gap penalty would be the product of the two BL. This method favors shorter gaps, with total score decreasing with each additional gap.

 ATTGACCTGA
 AT---CCTGA

Unlike constant gap penalty, the size of the gap is considered. With a match with score 1 and each gap -1, the score here is (7 − 3 = 4).

=== Affine ===
The most widely used gap penalty function is the affine gap penalty. The affine gap penalty combines the components in both the constant and linear gap penalty, taking the form formula_1. This introduces new terms, A is known as the gap opening penalty, B the gap extension penalty and L the length of the gap. Gap opening refers to the cost required to open a gap of any length, and gap extension the cost to extend the length of an existing gap by 1. Often it is unclear as to what the values A and B should be as it differs according to purpose. In general, if the interest is to find closely related matches (e.g. removal of vector sequence during genome sequencing), a higher gap penalty should be used to reduce gap openings. On the other hand, gap penalty should be lowered when interested in finding a more distant match. The relationship between A and B also have an effect on gap size. If the size of the gap is important, a small A and large B (more costly to extend a gap) is used and vice versa. Only the ratio A/B is important, as multiplying both by the same positive constant formula_2 will increase all penalties by formula_2: formula_4 which does not change the relative penalty between different alignments.

=== Convex ===
Using the affine gap penalty requires the assigning of fixed penalty values for both opening and extending a gap. This can be too rigid for use in a biological context.

The logarithmic gap takes the form formula_5 and was proposed as studies had shown the distribution of indel sizes obey a power law. Another proposed issue with the use of affine gaps is the favoritism of aligning sequences with shorter gaps. Logarithmic gap penalty was invented to modify the affine gap so that long gaps are desirable. However, in contrast to this, it has been found that using logarithmatic models had produced poor alignments when compared to affine models.

===Profile-based===
Profile–profile alignment algorithms are powerful tools for detecting protein homology relationships with improved alignment accuracy. Profile-profile alignments are based on the statistical indel frequency profiles from multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST searches. Rather than using substitution matrices to measure the similarity of amino acid pairs, profile–profile alignment methods require a profile-based scoring function to measure the similarity of profile vector pairs. Profile-profile alignments employ gap penalty functions. The gap information is usually used in the form of indel frequency profiles, which is more specific for the sequences to be aligned. ClustalW and MAFFT adopted this kind of gap penalty determination for their multiple sequence alignments. Alignment accuracies can be improved using this model, especially for proteins with low sequence identity. Some profile–profile alignment algorithms also run the secondary structure information as one term in their scoring functions, which improves alignment accuracy.

== Comparing time complexities ==

The use of alignment in computational biology often involves sequences of varying lengths. It is important to pick a model that would efficiently run at a known input size. The time taken to run the algorithm is known as the time complexity. 
==Challenges==
There are a few challenges when it comes to working with gaps. When working with popular algorithms there seems to be little theoretical basis for the form of the gap penalty functions. Consequently, for any alignment situation gap placement must be empirically determined. Also, pairwise alignment gap penalties, such as the affine gap penalty, are often implemented independent of the amino acid types in the inserted or deleted fragment or at the broken ends, despite evidence that specific residue types are preferred in gap regions. Finally, alignment of sequences implies alignment of the corresponding structures, but the relationships between structural features of gaps in proteins and their corresponding sequences are only imperfectly known. Because of this incorporating structural information into gap penalties is difficult to do. Some algorithms use predicted or actual structural information to bias the placement of gaps. However, only a minority of sequences have known structures, and most alignment problems involve sequences of unknown secondary and tertiary structure.

<text>Choi Ji-woo (born Choi Mi-hyang on June 11, 1975) is a South Korean actress. Considered one of South Korea&#x27;s most beautiful women, she has received critical acclaim for her work in a wide range of melodramas, most notably &quot;Beautiful Days&quot; (2001), &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; (2002), &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (2003),
&quot;Air City&quot; (2007), &quot;Star&#x27;s Lover&quot; (2008), &quot;The Suspicious Housekeeper&quot; (2013), and &quot;Temptation&quot; (2014), as well as the romantic comedy series &quot;Twenty Again&quot; (2015) and &quot;Woman with a Suitcase&quot; (2016)&quot;.

== Career ==
===1994–1998: Beginnings===
Choi Mi-hyang was first discovered when she won a talent audition organized by MBC in 1994, then made her acting debut in the drama series &quot;War and Love&quot; in 1995. Afterwards, she adopted the stage name Choi Ji-woo.

She was cast in her first major role in 1996 film &quot;The Gate of Destiny&quot;, but her limited acting skills resulted in her being replaced during filming. In the next couple of years Choi continued to star in both TV dramas and films, including &quot;The Hole&quot; (the Original version of Hollywood thriller &quot;Hush&quot;), as well as the romantic comedies &quot;First Kiss&quot; with Ahn Jae-wook and &quot;The Romantic President&quot; with Ahn Sung-ki. It was her portrayals on TV of tragic heroines with a pure and innocent image—notably in &quot;Truth&quot; opposite Ryu Si-won and &quot;Beautiful Days&quot; opposite Lee Byung-hun—that boosted her rising popularity.

In 2002, she reunited onscreen with Bae Yong-joon (she previously had a supporting role in his 1996 drama &quot;First Love&quot;) that she would star in her most famous, iconic role. Directed by Yoon Seok-ho as the second installment of his &quot;season dramas,&quot; &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; became a phenomenal hit throughout Asia and has been credited as one of the initiators of the Korean Wave. As a result, Choi gained wide pan-Asian recognition, especially a huge following in Japan where she acquired the nickname &quot;Ji-woo Hime&quot; (&quot;Princess Ji-woo&quot;). In 2009 she and Bae reprised their roles as voice actors for &quot;Winter Sonata Anime&quot;. She continues to be a lucrative star and brand in Japan, fetching high licensing/broadcasting rights for her dramas and selling out concerts and merchandise (tvN&#x27;s &quot;E News&quot; compiled a list of the top &quot;Hallyu&quot; stars in Japan based on their approximate gross incomes for the first half of 2011, and Choi was number five with approximately ).

After the success of her 2003 melodrama &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; with Kwon Sang-woo, Choi again attempted to break into film. She played a terminally ill heroine in &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, and a more risque character in sex comedy &quot;Everybody Has Secrets&quot; (&quot;The Original Version of Irish film &quot;About Adam&quot;). Both films were poorly received by critics and audiences in South Korea, but performed well at the Japanese box office.

Choi then spent the next few years overseas, shooting the Chinese drama &quot;101st Proposal&quot; with Sun Xing, and the Japanese drama &quot;RONDO&quot; opposite Yutaka Takenouchi. She returned to Korean television in 2007 in &quot;Air City&quot; alongside Lee Jung-jae; her role was the Chief Operating Officer of Incheon Airport.

===2009–2012: Breakthrough===
In 2009, she starred opposite Yoo Ji-tae in the drama &quot;Star&#x27;s Lover&quot;, playing a top actress who falls in love with an ordinary man. Choi received per episode, the highest salary for a Korean actress at the time (her record was later broken by Go Hyun-jung&#x27;s for the 2010 drama &quot;Daemul&quot;).

That same year, she set up her own management agency called C,JW Company with her brother as CEO. She also joined the ensemble cast of semi-improvisational mockumentary &quot;Actresses&quot;, arguably her most significant film yet.

During the press conference for the 2011 series, &quot;Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, co-starring Yoon Sang-hyun, featuring a lawyer couple facing their own divorce suit, she was asked if she worried about shedding her pure and innocent image. Choi said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had the same image for 15 years. Isn&#x27;t it time for me to break out? I was a melodrama queen and now I want the title of romantic comedy queen.&quot; She added that she had gained more fans after showing her cheerful, easygoing side as a guest on the reality show &quot;2 Days &amp; 1 Night&quot;.

In 2012, Choi was cast in the Chinese drama &quot;City Lovers&quot;, in which she portrayed the CEO at an event management company opposite Qin Hao, a newly employed businessman at her firm.

Later that year, she became the host of &quot;Choi Ji-woo&#x27;s Delicious Korea&quot; on food lifestyle cable channel O&#x27;live TV alongside fashion designer Jung Kuho. The 5-episode show, which aired from November 23 to December 21, 2012, aimed to promote Korean cuisine and culture to the world, and the two hosts traveled through South Korea and introduced little-known regional food to the viewers.

She next headlined the 2013 remake of the hit 2011 Japanese drama &quot;Kaseifu no Mita&quot;. In &quot;The Suspicious Housekeeper&quot;, Choi played the titular character, an icy and stoic yet amazingly capable housekeeper who comes to work for a recently widowed father and his four children. Despite the difficulty of not being able to react to her costars, Choi said she chose the role because she &quot;was really charmed by the way the heroine refrains from letting her emotions show.&quot;

===2014–present: Career resurgence===
In February 2014, Choi signed with the talent agency YG Entertainment. She then reunited with previous costar Kwon Sang-woo in &quot;Temptation&quot;; she played a rich woman who makes a dangerous offer to a married man.

Choi joined the fourth season of travel-reality show &quot;Grandpas Over Flowers&quot; in 2015, where she and Lee Seo-jin backpacked through Greece with veteran actors Lee Soon-jae, Shin Goo, Park Geun-hyung and Baek Il-seob.
This was followed by the cable series &quot;Twenty Again&quot;, where she gained critical acclaim as a shy 38-year-old housewife who decides to experience campus college life for the first time alongside her 20-year-old son.

In 2016, Choi returned to the big screen in seven years, starring in the ensemble cast romance film &quot;Like for Likes&quot;. The same year, she starred in the legal romance drama &quot;Woman with a Suitcase&quot;.

In 2017, Choi was cast in the family melodrama &quot;The Most Beautiful Goodbye&quot;, a remake of the drama &quot;The Most Beautiful Goodbye in the World&quot; by Noh Hee-kyung.

In 2019, Choi made a cameo appearance as herself in episode 13 of the tvN drama, &quot;Crash Landing on You&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Choi majored in aerobic dance at Busan Women&#x27;s College. She later enrolled in Hanyang University&#x27;s Department of Theater and Film and completed her first year; however she had to withdraw from college studies due to her hectic work schedule.

Choi married her non-celebrity boyfriend who is 9 years her junior, on March 29, 2018, in a private wedding, only publicly announcing it just hours prior through a handwritten letter released in her fan club website. Choi announced that she was pregnant with her first child on December 23, 2019, and gave birth to a daughter on May 16, 2020.

<doc id="1004779" wikidata="Q536989" url="?curid=1004779" title="Aulic Council">
<text>The Aulic Council (; ; literally &quot;Court Council of the Empire&quot;, sometimes abbreviated in academic writing as &quot;RHR&quot;) was one of the two supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire, the other being the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; (Imperial Chamber Court). Unlike the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, which was tied to the Imperial estates, the Aulic Council was tied directly to the Emperor.

It had not only concurrent jurisdiction with the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, but in many cases exclusive jurisdiction: the Aulic Council had exclusive jurisdiction in all &quot;feudal&quot; processes, and in criminal affairs, over the immediate subjects of the Emperor and in affairs which concerned the Empire, and more (see &quot;Responsibilities&quot; section below). It did not have a single set seat, rather, it was bound with the Emperor&#x27;s residences. Prague, Wels, and Frankfurt, were all sites of the court, but the most important seat of the Aulic Council was at the Hofburg residence of the Habsburg emperors in Vienna.

Since 1960, the Aulic Council has been extensively researched in academia, with some of its former court files (of which there are more than 100,000 that still exist) stored at the Austrian State Archives. It played a major role in the constitutional, legal, and political history of the Holy Roman Empire, and is considered one of the most prominent supreme courts in early modern Europe. In particular, the court helped stabilize the balance of power in the Empire and provided a forum for legal diplomacy, rather than violence. Historians often use the term &quot;juridification&quot; (&quot;Verrechtlichung&quot;) to describe this process of increased legal resolutions rather than violent resolutions in the Empire. As historian Eva Ortlieb puts it, &quot;Like the &quot;Rota&quot; &quot;Romana&quot; and the &quot;Parlement de Paris,&quot; [the Aulic Council] ranks among the most significant supreme courts of Europe.&quot;

==History==
To see responsibilities of the Aulic Council, go to the &quot;Responsibilities&quot; section. This section mainly goes over the development of the Aulic Council.

=== Early development during Maximilian I&#x27;s, Charles V&#x27;s, and Ferdinand I&#x27;s reigns ===
The Aulic Council (from the Latin &quot;aula&quot;, court in feudal language, in antiquity a Hellenistic type of grand residence, usually private) was originally an executive-judicial council for the Empire. Originating during the Late Middle Ages as a paid Council of the Emperor, it was organized in its later form by Maximilian I by decree in 1498. It was meant as a rival to the separate &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, which the Imperial Estates had established at the Diet of Worms two years before. Maximilian emphasized the fact that the Emperor embodied supreme legal authority and would continue to answer legal requests addressed to him. There is also the possibility some of the Imperial estates wanted to create a court directly beholden to the Emperor so they could appeal to the Emperor directly. These developments are all considered part of a greater Imperial Reform movement, known as &quot;Reichsreform&quot;.

During the reign of Charles V, the Aulic Council responded to hundreds of petitions, as the Emperor was often absent from the Empire. The Aulic Council did not serve as a state council however. Important political decisions were sent to the Emperor&#x27;s privy council (&quot;Geheimer Rat&quot;), which would propose decisions. Research suggests that during Charles V&#x27;s reign, the Aulic Council was reformed with new councilors and presidents every time the Emperor visited the Empire. However, it is possible that councilors travelled with Charles outside the Empire in order to help with German affairs. Charles V&#x27;s brother, Archduke Ferdinand (the future Emperor Ferdinand I), who served as the Habsburg &quot;viceroy&quot; (later King of the Romans), maintained his own council too. In 1541, the Aulic Council was consolidated into a more permanent body. It received an &quot;ordo consilii&quot; in 1550, and when Charles V abdicated, Ferdinand&#x27;s council was implemented as the new Aulic Council, receiving an ordinance in 1559, and continued some of Charles&#x27;s court traditions.

=== Further Development of the Aulic Council ===
In the late 1500s and early 1600s, particularly during Emperor Rudolf II&#x27;s reign, the Aulic Council was frequently tasked to deal with conflicts that could not be settled by the Imperial Diet or by arbitration. An interesting note to make is that during this time, the Aulic Council often dealt with religious disputes. The council likely sided with the Catholic side more often than not, which was critiqued by Protestant princes. The use of the Aulic Council for judicial matters also greatly increased in the late 1500s. 

The relationship between the Aulic Council and the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; is described as both competitive but also cooperative, depending on the situation. For most cases, litigants could choose between both courts. From 1620 onward, the Aulic Council began to significantly out produce the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; in terms of litigantion totals. It is also during this time the Aulic Council underwent large reforms. The court would appoint &quot;Fiskal&quot;, special attorneys (see more information in &quot;Composition&quot; section), and established advocates to represent any litigants. The Aulic Council would further evolve thanks to the Peace of Westphalia (1648) (which rectified some of the religious issues in the council), and later Emperor Ferdinand III&#x27;s new constitution for the court in 1654. The Aulic Council being faster than the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, and also possessing the Emperor&#x27;s direct authority, made it attractive to litigants. After Westphalia, the Aulic Council&#x27;s involvement in Imperial Cities also grew (see &quot;Responsibilities: Imperial Cities&quot; section)

In 1767, the Aulic Council handled 2,088 cases. This grew to 3,388 in 1779.

When Napoleon I&#x27;s gains after the Battle of Austerlitz and the Peace of Pressburg culminated in the end of the Holy Roman Empire, the Aulic Council likewise ceased to exist in 1806 as an imperial institution.

=== Was the Aulic Council a puppet of the Emperor? ===
Though the court was often in Vienna and politically tied to the Emperor, many historians do not consider it to be strictly partisan in favor of the Emperor. A nuanced view states how Emperors after the Westphalia (1648) realized that using the Aulic Council for political means would make the court less respected, and that the courts sometimes went against the Emperor&#x27;s wishes or policies. The Aulic Council attached much of its importance to legal arguments, so it sometimes contradicted the Emperor. Historian Leopold Auer states that &quot;the interests of the [Emperor] could, of course, go against [the Aulic Council&#x27;s] policy... and [create] to conflicts in which the Council might even come to conclusions different from those of the emperor himself.&quot; There are examples of such in the &quot;Examples of Cases Settled&quot; section.

=== An example of juridification and the protection of smaller Imperial estates: Brandenburg-Kulmbach v. Prussia ===
The Holy Roman Empire, even in its later years, maintained relative peace and stability. Additionally, the existence of smaller territorial princes was maintained, in spite of attempts by more powerful princes to absorb smaller ones (which later occurred during mediatisation). In this regard, the Aulic Council played a major role. Historian Siegrid Westphal demonstrated in her work that the Aulic Council played the role of a mediator in conflicts between Imperial estates. A great example of this is the Brandenburg-Kulmbach succession crisis.

Ruled by a branch of the Prussian Hohenzollern family, the small margraviate was at risk of falling into Prussian hands. Prussia had purchased the succession claim from a junior Brandenburg-Kulmbach prince, Christian Heinrich, in 1703. This led to a dispute over whether or not Christian Heinrich&#x27;s son, George Frederich Karl, should have succession rights. The Prussians refused to accept George Frederich Karl&#x27;s claim, and began to actively prepare the territory for a Prussian takeover following the death of the reigning Margrave, George Wilhelm.

Worried about the possibility of Prussian annexation, Kulmbach margraves appealed to the Emperor and the Elector of Mainz for protection. Imperial Vice-Chancellor, Friedrich Karl von Schönborn, petitioned the case to Emperor Charles VI, seeking to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power. To appear impartial, the case was sent to the Aulic Council. In 1716, the Aulic Council declared that the Prussian purchase of the Kulmbach succession claim was invalid, and went against the succession customs of the Hohenzollerns. The Aulic Council stated that the transfer of claims was made during a time of duress (War of the Spanish Succession). A Kulmbach envoy is reported to have said have commented &quot;&#x27;at least in Germany we no longer have to rely on weapons, but on due process, which gives the weaker estates cause to rejoice.&quot; Prussia complied with the Aulic Council&#x27;s demands, and the crisis in Kulmbach was settled without further trouble.

An interesting note to be made is that even though Kulmbach was receiving Imperial protection, it, alongside other princes like the Duchy of Württemberg, had been trying to suppress the rights of the Imperial knights, which were being protected by the Emperor. This shows how the Emperor could intervene on multiple layers of hierarchy: the Emperor was protecting the margrave from Prussia, but also protecting the Imperial knights against the margraves.

This was far from the only case where the Aulic Council defended the rights of weaker Imperial estates against larger ones. Leopold Auer writes that &quot;the Imperial Aulic Council guaranteed the continuity and stability of the complex constitutional structure of the Old Reich by protecting the less powerful members of the Empire against the threats posed by the bigger Estates.&quot; Further examples can be found in the &quot;Examples of Cases Settled&quot; section.

== Composition ==

=== President ===
The president of the Aulic Council was a nobleman, often a count. They did not necessarily have legal training, but did have experience in politics and diplomacy. The president moderated sessions and took part in voting. His vote was a tiebreaker. He was appointed by the Emperor. There was also a vice president. 

=== Vice Chancellor ===
The Vice Chancellor, who was appointed by the Elector of Mainz in his capacity as Imperial archchancellor, held sway in the Aulic Council.

=== Councillors ===
Each Emperor summoned a new Council upon his accession to the throne. The court normally consisted of 10-25 members, though this fluctuated over time. Under pressure from the Imperial Diet, the number of Protestants and Catholics on the council were balanced by Ferdinand III in 1654. Upon the death of an Emperor, the council was dissolved and had to be reconstructed by his successor. The Emperor was responsible for paying the councillors.

The council was divided into two benches: The Lords&#x27; Bench (&quot;Herrenbank&quot;), mainly consisting of councillors recruited from the nobility, and the Knights&#x27; and Scholars&#x27; Bench (&quot;Ritter- und Gelehrtenbank&quot;). Both benches decided as one body. Councillors generally had legal qualifications, and their votes held the same weight.

Councilors often had professional experience in Habsburg governance, worked in estates closely tied to the Emperor, or served on the &quot;Reichskammergericht.&quot;

=== Fiskal ===
The Fiskal (also spelled &quot;Fiskale&quot;), were special attorneys that represented Imperial interests. They often came from amongst officials in either the Aulic Council, the &quot;Reichskanzlei&quot; (Imperial Chancellery), or Austria below the Enns River.

=== Other ===
The court also employed numerous lawyers, attorneys, procurators, and scribes.

== Decision Making and Enforcement ==
The court made decisions based on majority vote, and transcriptions were written in German or Latin. Proceedings were not comparatively formal, less so than the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, and instead aimed to resolve conflict amicably. Rulings were not appealable, and decisions could only be challenged by appealing to the Emperor, or later, the Imperial Diet. In cases where the court was in doubt, it could contact the Emperor for help with decision-making (&quot;votum ad imperatorem&quot;). In particular, cases that immense political sensitivity would be sent to the Emperor and his privy-conference (&quot;Geheime Konferenz&quot;) for recommendations. The privy-conference in particular was prone to political polarization. Three key factions, the &quot;Reichskanzlei&quot;, the Austrian &quot;Hofkanzlei&quot; (Court-Chancellery), and the Spanish Council, all fought over influence in the Austrian Habsburg court. During Emperor Charles VI&#x27;s reign, these factions often went against each other. To mitigate this and create some coordination, the president of the Aulic Council was often part of the privy-conference when Aulic Council cases were under investigation.The Imperial Aulic Council often emphasized mediation over formal verdicts. It frequently employed &quot;commissions&quot; to facilitate compromises between parties, and sometimes the act of filing a complaint with the Council was sufficient to encourage settlement. Notably, both the Aulic Council and the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; demonstrated their moderating influence in witch trials: both courts tried to (and with some success managed to) prevent excessive cruelty in the proceedings.

When required, the Aulic Council had a formalized method of issuing verdicts, mainly through use of military force, and enlisted help from &quot;commissions&quot; consisting of princes in Imperial Circles. Such enforcement was legitimized by the Emperor. Interestingly, the Aulic Council could enforce many of its verdicts, even against stronger members of the Empire (ex. Prussia), without using force, to the extent that Frederick William I of Prussia, the famous &quot;Soldier King&quot;, partook in bribing members of the Aulic Council in hopes of securing more favorable verdicts, to avoid being contumacious. These enforcement and arbitration mechanisms all helped establish the principle of juridification in the Empire. 

== Responsibilities ==
An important clarification is that the Aulic Council handled both judicial and political matters, and the distinction between both is not always easy to make. The Aulic Council did not try to make a distinction between the two, calling all of its cases &quot;causae&quot;.

During the reigns of Charles V and Ferdinand I, the Aulic Council focused primarily on acts of grace (&quot;gratialia&quot; or &quot;Gnadensachen&quot;), which encompassed granting privileges, exercising imperial rights in both secular and religious spheres, issuing pardons, and handling intervention petitions. This emphasis on acts of grace made the emperor an essential partner for all social groups within the Empire while providing him with diverse means of wielding influence.

Like the Imperial Chamber Court, the Aulic Council was an appeals court, in which matters that could not be settled were brought to the supreme court for deliberation.

The Aulic Council commonly dealt with feudal disputes. These included &quot;imperial overlordship, protecting imperial fiefs, all issues relating to investitures, inheritance, pawning, or purchase of fiefs, and all sorts of lawsuits related to these matters.&quot; The Aulic Council also dealt with constitutional disputes, especially in Imperial cities and imperial knightly territories. It also proved to be a major court when it came to succession disputes within the Empire. For example, the Aulic Council was charged with dealing with cases such as the Jülich Succession and the succession in the Ernestine duchies. Internal conflicts between rulers and their subjects were also commonly brought to the Aulic Council. See the &quot;Examples of Cases Studied&quot; section below for more information. Uniquely, the Aulic Council also had exclusive rights over judicial matters in the Kingdom of Italy.

The Aulic Council was also often concerned with private law. It often heard economic disputes, disputes over sovereign rights, disputes between princes and provincial diets, and disputes between landowners and subjects. In addition to the aforementioned responsibilities, the Aulic Council also dealt with house pacts and family disputes. An example of this is the Nassau Family Pact, which was submitted to review by the Aulic Council. The court processed also imperial privileges, issuing letters of safe conduct, passage, and protection, granted legitimation of bastard children, and confirmed various contracts and wills.

The Aulic Council was meant to serve as a supreme court for the Habsburg crownlands, but by the end of the 17th century, this was no longer the case, so most cases came from elsewhere in the Empire. An exception to this were Jewish litigations, who were protected by the Emperor and as such could petition their complaints to the council, even if in the Habsburg crownlands. Oftentimes, Jewish businessmen would use the Aulic Council to sue princes for nonpayment of debts.

=== Debit Commission ===

The Aulic Council also possessed the right to watch over finances of princes and deal with maladministration through the Debit Commission (&quot;Debitkommissionen&quot;). The court had the right to prevent princes or free cities from taking too much debt, by holding the power to authorize large loans (though this was often bypassed). If a prince defaulted, the council could appoint a commission that would take over the governing of the land until the debt was repaid. In this time, the prince would be granted a pension. This was probably tolerated by the imperial princes since it enhanced their credit amongst lenders. Through its management of princely finances, the court saved many noble houses from financial ruin, such as the Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

=== Free Cities ===
The Aulic Council frequently intervened in the constitutions of Imperial Cities. Before and during the 30 Years&#x27; War, Emperors used the Aulic Council to achieve religious peace in the cities. This meant compromising municipal governments. The Peace of Westphalia changed this, by making the compromises unnecessary (by establishing religious status-quo), and this led to city citizens addressing many complaints to the Aulic Council. During Charles VI&#x27;s reign, with guidance from Vice-Chancellor Schönborn, Imperial policy was attempting to make the administration in the Imperial Cities more uniform, and to tie them closer to the Emperor. Examples of such include Aulic Council verdicts pertaining to constitutional conflict in Frankfurt and Augsburg, which restricted the power of city governments in favor of the citizens. Leopold Auer states that this caused the Aulic Council to function almost like a &quot;constitutional high court.&quot;

=== Protection of civilian rights ===
The Aulic Council and the &quot;Reichskammgericht&quot; both protected the rights of the people against local governments. The court&#x27;s power could even bypass the Privilegium de non appellando, if the litigants could credibly show that they had been denied due process. Low funds and low social status did not hamper one from appealing to the court, as the Aulic Council was required to provide counsel free of charge (the &quot;Reichskammegericht&quot; had a similar establishment). Peasants often sought audiences with the Emperor, with some travelling from distant parts of the Empire. The Emperor would generally give a formulaic response: &quot;You shall have justice&quot; (&quot;Euch wird Recht werden&quot;), before turning over the case to the Aulic Council.

== More Examples of Cases Settled ==

=== 16th Century ===

==== Reichsregiment v. Archduchy of Austria ====
The case &quot;Reichsregiment&quot; v. Archduchy of Austria was primarily contested over an economic issue, pertaining to the Archduchy of Austria&#x27;s investment agreements with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The &quot;Reichsregiment&quot; sued the Archduchy of Austria over Austria&#x27;s failure to comply with Imperial obligations. See a translated English transcript of the case here: https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/51529251/rechsregiment-v-archduchy-of-austria.pdf

=== 17 Century ===

==== Jülich-Cleves-Berg Succession Crisis ====
In 1609, a succession crisis in the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg fell under the jurisdiction of the Aulic Council. The case was not resolved and escalated into the War of the Jülich Succession.

==== Erfurt v. Mainz ====
Between 1648 and 1664, Erfurt&#x27;s magistrates attempted to secure the city&#x27;s status as an imperial city. However, Erfurt was nominally subject to the Elector of Mainz. Two struggles ensued: one between Erfurt and Mainz, and another between the burghers of Erfurt and the magistrates (the burghers were concerned about their privileges). The Elector of Mainz in particular sought to use the opportunity to strengthen his control over Erfurt. In this period, the Emperor appointed four commissions to deal with the crisis, with the last three commissions all including members of the Aulic Council. The appointed Aulic Councilor, Johann Christoph von Schmidburg, was a partisan in favor of Mainz. Erfurt was placed under Imperial Ban, and the Elector of Mainz was given the right to enforce the imperial decree. In 1664, Erfurt was subdued by Mainz for good.

=== 18th Century ===

==== Deposition of Prince William Hyacinth ====
Prince William Hyacinth ruled the small territory of Nassau-Siegen. His violent and extortionately behavior led to multiple lawsuits against him at the Aulic Council, which led to armed intervention in his lands, and later his deposition in 1707. Following William&#x27;s deposition, the Aulic Council commissioned the cathedral chapter of the Electorate of Cologne to temporarily administer his lands. The court&#x27;s mandates were &quot;promptly executed by Electoral Cologne.&quot; Later, the lands would pass into the administration of the local Imperial Circle.
==== Limpurg Succession Crisis ====
When the Count of Limpurg (not to be confused with Limburg) died without heirs in 1713 without male heirs, Prussia occupied the territory. The widowed countess appealed to the Aulic Council, in hopes of restoring the autonomy of Limpurg. The prince-bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg, along with the Duke of Württemberg, formed a commission, and the countess requested that &quot;in case good offices are employed to no avail, [the commissioners] should employ armed force to drive the Prussian invaders out of the Limpurg territories&quot;. The Prussians promptly withdrew from Limpurg, and the countess was restored to her lands.

==== Uncovered fraud of Rheingraf Karl Magnus ====
Rheingraf Karl Magnus of Grehweiler contracted large loans by forging the consent of his subjects. He used these funds to pay for his construction projects. When his fraud was uncovered, the Aulic Council sentenced him to 10 years in prison.

==== Internal Disputes in Mecklenburg and Württemberg ====
Internal conflicts were often fought between princes and local estates and parliaments. Oftentimes, these were fought over taxation. A form of this occurred in Mecklenburg and Württemberg. The Aulic Council played a significant role in both cases. In Württemberg, the estates&#x27; complaints led to the emperor deposing regent Frederick Charles in 1693. Similarly, in Mecklenburg, a complaint resulted in the emperor deposing Karl Leopold in 1728. Ultimately, these conflicts ended with victories for the estates over their rulers—Mecklenburg in 1755 and Württemberg in 1764/70. Similar cases also occurred in Bavaria and East Frisia.

==== Kann v. Bamberger ====

==== Hesse-Rheinfels v. Hesse-Kassel ====
A dispute between Hesse-Rheinfels (sometimes referred to as Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg or Hesse-Rotenburg) and Hesse-Kassel was fought over the Rheinfels fortress and the county of Katzenelnbogen. The lands belonged to Hesse-Rheinfels, but the fortress was occupied by the larger Hesse-Kassel in 1692 to defend it against French attacks in the Nine Years&#x27; War. Hesse-Kassel decided to retain the fortress even after the war, until the Treaty of Baden (1714), which demanded that Hesse-Kassel return the fort to Hesse-Rheinfels. Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel refused, and so Hesse-Rheinfels appealed to the Emperor. The Aulic Council supported the claim of Hesse-Rheinfels, but the mandate was unable to be enforced, due to developments both within the Empire and beyond (Hesse-Kassel had support from the Dutch Republic, for example, and had marriage ties with Sweden). Eventually, in 1718, armies of the Palatinate, Mainz, and Trier, engaged in skirmishes against Hesse-Kassel. The conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War finally led to Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s surrender, as it meant Imperial armies could be diverted to deal with the issue.

==== Bentheim-Tecklenburg v. Prussia and Solms-Braunfels ====
The County of Tecklenburg had been engaged in a succession dispute since the 1500s. In 1686, the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; issued a verdict which settled the conflict, splitting the territory between Bentheim-Tecklenburg and Solms-Braunfels. In 1696, Solms-Braunfels ceded their claim to Brandenburg-Prussia. When Prussia and Solms-Braunfels occupied Tecklenburg in 1701, Bentheim-Tecklenburg appealed to the Aulic Council. The conflict escalated when Solms-Braunfels formally sold Tecklenburg to Prussia. The Aulic Council declared this sale illegal. Prussia&#x27;s activity was condemned by members of the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle, in particular Münster and the Palatinate. At the Imperial Diet of 1722, Prussia, Solms-Braunfels, and the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, challenged the Aulic Council&#x27;s decision. Prussia claimed that since the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; had already reached a verdict on the case, the Aulic Council should have never reopened the case. The Aulic Council argued that the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; was not authorized to pass verdicts on disputed immediate Imperial estates, but the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; responded by claiming that Tecklenburg was not a county immediate to the Emperor, but only an allodial property. The case was unable to be settled in the diet.

The Aulic Council continued to publish verdicts against Prussia throughout 1725, but failure of the council to enforce the case, coupled with the Emperor needing Prussia support with the Pragmatic Sanction, led to a 1729 treaty between Prussia and Bentheim-Tecklenburg. Bentheim-Tecklenburg would give up its claim to Tecklenburg, but would receive 750,000 Reichstaler. The Emperor ratified the treaty in 1730, and Prussia annexed Tecklenburg.

Interestingly, the Tecklenburg case is an example of the Aulic Council somewhat going against Habsburg policy. Despite the Emperor Charles VI attempting to &quot;woo&quot; Prussia in exchange for agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction, the Aulic Council remained steadfast in challenging Prussia&#x27;s position in Tecklenburg.

==== Knights of the Göler v. Electoral Palatinate ====
Zwingenberg, a fief of the Electoral Palatinate, had been ruled by the lords of Hirschhorn, which fell extinct in 1632. According to a succession treaty in the Peace of Westphalia, the territory was meant to pass to the knights of the Göler. Instead, the Elector Palatine, Charles III Phillip, granted the land to the Wiser family. In 1725, the Aulic Council ordered the Elector Palatine to restore Zwingenberg to the Göler.

Diplomatic developments in Europe complicated matters. The Peace of Vienna, and the subsequent Treaty of Hanover, created two new alliances in the continent, which established a new balance of power. Both parties wanted to ally with the powerful German princes: the Palatinate was being courted by Vienna. In 1726, an alliance was agreed upon between the Emperor and the Palatinate, with the Elector Palatine receiving subsidies and support in the Jülich-Berg succession.

Nonetheless, the Aulic Council remained hostile against the Palatinate when it came to the Zwingenberg case. The Swabian circle, was commissioned to eject the Elector-Palatine, but the Emperor did not immediately execute the order by 1727. The Palatinate appealed to the Imperial Diet, with support from the Catholic princes, but with relations between the Elector Palatine and the Emperor deteriorating in 1728, the Emperor became impatient with the issue, and sided with the Protestant party (&quot;Corpus Evangelicorum&quot;) against the Palatinate (this came after the Emperor promised the Jülich-Berg succession to Prussia, which led to the Elector Palatine aligning himself with the Habsburgs&#x27; rivals). In 1728, an unverified report stated that an Swabian commission lawyer was jailed and beaten, and a report from the Aulic Council stated that Imperial delegates were turned away by Palatine dragoons, when attempting to enter Zwingenberg. The Aulic Council was outraged, and demanded that the Elector Palatine be reprimanded. The Elector Palatine was ordered to stop obstructing the commission and that failure to do so would result in unrest in the Empire. In 1728, the Elector Palatine finally stepped down, and the Aulic Council&#x27;s demand was executed in November 1728.

<text>Timo Rautiainen ja Trio Niskalaukaus (fin. &quot;Timo Rautiainen and Trio Neckshot&quot;) is a heavy metal band from Finland, formed in 1997. The band was led by Timo Rautiainen, leading member of Finnish metallers Lyijykomppania, a band which is still highly popular in Finland and has a small foreign following in the scene. The musical influence of the band ranges from Black Sabbath to more modern metal acts. Lyrically, the themes presented in their songs range from global issues (such as global warming, genocide, war and nuclear waste or nuclear weapons left loose) to personal tragedy (such as the death of a loved one, school bullying and suicide), typically in a dark and serious tone. They have released seven albums to date.

For more than 20 years, Rautiainen has made music in the Finnish language. However, when a friend came to him with the idea of making a German spoken album, Rautiainen was very interested. The album produced during this session, &quot;In frostigen Tälern&quot; (&quot;In Frozen Valleys&quot;) (2001), was the first German album by a Finnish act. In 2004 the band released their second album in German, titled &quot;Hartes Land&quot; (&quot;Hard Land&quot;). The albums in German consist of songs which had already been released in Finnish and later translated.

A visional cue in the band&#x27;s album art is that no upper case letters are used in any occasion. Their logo is a shovel crossed with a pickaxe, usually both covered with breeze. Also in live shows, the logo is used as backdrop with a skull accompanying the shovel and pickaxe.

The band has published several music videos, some of them dedicated to (and filmed with) Finnish military serving under KFOR mission in Kosovo.

A biographical book about Rautiainen and his bands was released in 2003. It was written by Finnish journalist Timo Isoaho.

The band announced that it would be going on break for an indefinite period of time as of December 2004. On November 1, 2006, the band announced that they would be breaking up. Timo Rautiainen went on to pursue a solo career by himself and was eventually joined by the former guitarist Jarkko Petosalmi. He made 3 albums (Sarvivuori, Loppuun ajettu, En oo keittäny enkä myyny) before creating yet another project named Timo Rautiainen ja Neljäs sektori. This band had essentially the same line-up as they did in Timo&#x27;s solo career except a new drummer was hired. After Jarkko urged Timo to reunite with Trio Niskalaukaus several times Timo decided to play a single concert with the Trio Niskalaukaus line-up using the cover name &quot;Liiton Miehet&quot; in 2016. With the band being less burnt out from excess touring Timo decided to give Trio Niskalaukaus a new shot.

In 2017 the band indeed did a comeback, releasing a new album (&quot;Lauluja Suomesta&quot;, &quot;Songs from Finland&quot; in English) and going on tour. A new biography named &quot;Trio Niskalaukaus&quot; featuring interviews from the band members was released on August 17, 2018, as a follow-up to the first book of the same name and author.

<text>A sea anchor (also known as a parachute anchor, drift anchor, drift sock, para-anchor or boat brake) is a device that is streamed from a boat in heavy weather. Its purpose is to stabilize the vessel and to limit progress through the water. Rather than tethering the boat to the seabed with a conventional anchor, a sea anchor provides hydrodynamic drag, thereby acting as a brake. Normally attached to a vessel&#x27;s bows, a sea anchor can prevent the vessel from turning broadside to the waves and being overwhelmed by them.

Early sea anchors were crude devices, but today most take the form of a drogue parachute. Larger sea anchors are so efficient that they need a tripping line to collapse the parachute for retrieval. Being made of fabric, a sea parachute may be bagged and easily stowed when not in use.

A similar device to the sea anchor is the much smaller drogue, which is streamed from a vessel&#x27;s stern in strong winds so as to slow the boat to prevent pitchpoling or broaching in an overtaking sea. The fundamental difference between the sea anchor and the drogue is that the drogue will slow the boat while keeping the heading steady, and is intended to be launched from the stern. The parachute anchor is designed to be launched from the bow and effectively stop the boat&#x27;s progress relative to the current in an open sea.

==Design==
Anything that can act as a source of sufficient stable drag in the water can act as a sea anchor; a common improvised drag device is a long line (a docking warp or anchor rope) payed out into the water; while this does not provide much drag, it can act as a drogue and aid in running downwind. Adding items to increase drag can convert this to a sea anchor. A (floating) bucket tied to the end of the line works as a basic sea anchor. In &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;, author and sailor Jack London described using various broken spars and sails, tied to a line, as an improvised sea anchor. A sail, weighed down with an anchor chain or other heavy object, will also work as an improvised sea anchor.

Early sea anchors were often improvised from spare parts aboard ship. An 1877 book used by the United States Naval Academy describes methods of making sea anchors. These took the form of a wooden or metal framework forming a simple kite-like shape of sail canvas, backed with a net or closely spaced ropes to provide strength. A small anchor attached to one corner kept the sea anchor from twisting. If the framework was wooden, the wood&#x27;s buoyancy kept the sea anchor just under the surface, while an iron framework used a buoy to keep it at the proper depth.

Modern commercial sea anchors are usually made of cloth, shaped like a parachute or cone, and rigged so that the wider end leads and the narrower end trails. When deployed, this type of sea anchor floats just under the surface, and the water moving past the sea anchor keeps it filled. Some varieties are cylindrical, with an adjustable opening in the rear that allows the amount of braking to be adjusted when deployed.

The size of the sea anchor determines how much water it can displace, and how much braking it can provide. It is also possible to use more than one sea anchor to increase the braking.

The &#x27;series drogue&#x27; is a drogue (not a sea anchor) that allows the operator to increase or decrease the resistance by laying out more or less of a line with many small drag devices spread out along a line - this also serves to ease retrieval under heavy conditions.

Most larger sea anchors will provide a mechanism to collapse the anchor for retrieval. This is called a &quot;trip line&quot;, and attaches to the rear of the anchor, allowing it to be pulled in back first, shedding water rather than filling. This trip line can be rigged a number of ways, depending on the preference of the user.

==Use==
Sea anchors can be used by vessels of any size, from kayaks to commercial fishing vessels, and were even used by sea-landing naval Zeppelins in World War I. While the purpose of the anchor is to provide drag to slow the vessel, there are a number of ways this can be used:
*The first use of the sea anchor is as an aid to vessels in heavy weather. A boat that is not kept bow-on or stern-on to heavy seas can more easily be rolled by the action of breaking waves. By attaching the sea anchor to a bridle running from bow to stern, the boat can be held at any angle relative to the wind. This is useful in sailboats in conditions too windy to use the sails to maintain a heading, and in motor vessels that are unable to make sufficient headway to maintain steerage.
*Sea anchors also reduce the speed at which a vessel will drift with the wind. Often sold as &quot;drift anchors&quot; or &quot;drift socks&quot;, sea anchors are used in fishing vessels to hold them stationary relative to the water to allow a certain area to be fished, without having to use the motor.
*Sea anchors may also be used as anchors to allow warping of a vessel in deep water.

The length and type of the line, or rope, used to attach the sea anchor to the bow is also important. In addition to connecting the sea anchor to the hull, the rope also acts as a shock absorber. The stretching of the rope under load will smooth out the changes in loading caused by the changing force of the waves interacting with the hull of the vessel. Because a high degree of stretch is desirable in this application, a material with a low elastic modulus is preferred, such as nylon. If there is no concern about breaking waves and the only reason the sea anchor is being used is to reduce drift from the wind, then a short rope may be used. If short rope is used on large ocean swells, its length should be tuned to the wavelength of the waves; either under 1/3 of the wavelength, or an integer multiple of the wavelength. A line significantly shorter than the wavelength means the anchor and hull will ride over the crests together, while a line equal to the wavelength will keep the hull and anchor from ending up out of phase, which can result in severe loading on the anchor. In stormy seas, and when breaking waves are a concern, it is important to not tune the rope length to the waves, so that the anchor and boat are not rolled by the same wave or by adjacent waves. The ability to absorb shock is even more important. Under these conditions, a rope as much as 10 to 15 times the length of the hull should be used to provide a high degree of shock absorption.

<text>Kingsley Hall is a community centre, in Powis Road, Bromley-by-Bow in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It dates back to the work of Doris and Muriel Lester, who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for &quot;educational, social and recreational&quot; purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on 14 July 1927. 

A second community centre, also known as &quot;Kingsley Hall&quot; with a church (KHCCC -Kingsley Hall Church and Community Centre), was later built by the sisters in the neighbouring London Borough of Barking and Dagenham on Parsloes Avenue in Dagenham. KHCCC underwent redevelopment in 2018.

During the General Strike of 1926, Kingsley Hall in Bow became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Mohandas Gandhi stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the Gandhi Foundation. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the Jarrow March stayed at the Hall.

In 1965 R. D. Laing and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community, influenced by the World War II Northfield experiments, for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the Philadelphia Association was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by schizophrenia.
The idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by Mary Barnes an artist and former nurse and, first resident as patient.

The hall was designated a Grade II listed building in September 1973.

==Origins==
Doris, Muriel and Kingsley Lester grew up in wealth and comfort, though there was a family connection to the poor East End districts. Their grandfather Henry Lester grew up in poverty, starting work as a bricklayer&#x27;s labourer at the age of eight. Their father, also called Henry Lester started work at the Thames Ironworks at Blackwall and Canning Town at the age of ten. He latterly owned a ship repair yard in Blackwall and would help finance some of his children&#x27;s early social work. Both father and grandfather were devout Baptists.

Henry Lester bought a cottage in Loughton, (then a countryside district of Essex), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, &quot;Rachel Cottage&quot; also served to provide holidays for nursery children.

In 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one shilling (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person – the mind, body and spirit – in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.

Kingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards &quot;educational, social and recreational&quot; purposes. Doris and Muriel Lester bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a &quot;people&#x27;s house&quot;, where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for &quot;worship, study, fun and friendship&quot;. The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.

The aims of the centre were expressed on the membership cards as 
&quot;a place of fellowship in which people can meet for social, educational and recreational intercourse without barriers of class, colour or creed.&quot;

During World War I, in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for Air Raid Wardens. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the House of Commons demanding that milk be sent to Germany, where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.

After the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the Suffragettes in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in Victoria Park. After her talks, local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an Alderman on the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.

Enough money was saved to build the Children&#x27;s House on Bruce Road which was opened by H. G. Wells in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The &quot;Children&#x27;s House&quot; continues to be run as a Nursery School.

==Powis Road site==
During the 1926 General Strike, the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodation was needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was Charles Cowles-Voysey.

A stone-laying ceremony took place on 14 July 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.

* Lady Clare Annesley laid the brick of &quot;SERVICE&quot;
* George M. Ll. Davies MP laid the brick of &quot;POLITICS&quot;
* Gilbert Bayes laid the brick of &quot;ART&quot;

Kingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on 15 September 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space for worship.

==Gandhi==
In 1931 Mahatma Gandhi accepted an invitation to stay there while he took part in talks on the future of India. He stayed in a small cell-bedroom on the roof, sleeping on the roof itself when the weather was suitable.
 In 1931, Lylie Valentine was a participant in activities at the hall before she became a worker at the nursery. In her pamphlet: &quot;Two Sisters and the Cockney Kids&quot;, she recounts the excitement surrounding Gandhi&#x27;s stay in the East End:
&quot;The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall...when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.&quot;
&quot;...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o&#x27;clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way... There was something about him that always lives with the people.&quot;

His daily walk would start before dawn and typically take about an hour at a brisk pace, taking in much of the local area, especially along the Lea and the local canal network. Routes varied, but he particularly enjoyed the walk along the Sewerbank (now known as the Greenway) through Stratford to Plaistow, because of the elevated views it gave. On these walks he would be joined by crowds of well-wishers eager to speak to him on a very wide range subjects, and this included many children. On occasion he would visit the homes of local people. 
He found it easy to relate to the local people, with Muriel Lester observing

&quot;He always enjoyed the swift repartee of Cockney wit. He was never at a loss for a reply in the same vein.&quot;

Gandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks, and also visited Kingsley Hall&#x27;s Dagenham site in that time. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat were pure press invention. Among Gandhi&#x27;s visitors were Charlie Chaplin, George Bernard Shaw, the Pearly King and Queen of east London, many politicians including David Lloyd George and the Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang.
Gandhi loved East London and the East Enders reciprocated. On leaving Kingsley Hall, he wrote in its visitor book: &quot;Love surrounded me here&quot;

Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.

\in 1954 English Heritage erected a Blue plaque on the façade of the building in honour of Gandhi.

==Jarrow March==
In 1935 Ellen Wilkinson led the Jarrow March to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a &quot;Freeman of the Borough of Poplar&quot; on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.

==R.D. Laing and Kingsley Hall==

Following World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.

In 1965 R. D. Laing and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result, Kingsley Hall became home to the Philadelphia Association and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry. Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos. Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.

One notable resident of this experiment was Mary Barnes. Along with resident psychiatrist Joseph Berke, Mary later went on to write &quot;Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness&quot;, describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play &quot;Mary Barnes&quot; by David Edgar. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author Axel Jensen.

The activities of residents in the &quot;no-holds barred&quot; experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies the building was severely damaged.

==Recent history==

In the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film &quot;Gandhi&quot;. During the filming Richard Attenborough united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.

Kingsley Hall was reopened 2 March 1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.

In 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interpreted its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in innovatory ways.

The Hall is run by a trust and is a registered charity no. 263813. Its premises are normally available for use by community and other social groups. In 2009, Kingsley Hall launched its website

The Bishopsgate Institute in London houses the Muriel Lester Archive

<text>Blankey Jet City was a Japanese rock trio from Aichi Prefecture, active from 1987 to 2000. It consisted of Kenichi Asai on vocals and guitar, Toshiyuki Terui on bass, and Tatsuya Nakamura on drums.

== History ==
Blankey Jet City was formed in 1987, in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Their career then officially started in 1990, when they appeared on a popular TBS television show for amateur bands that August. Their performances attracted the attention of the major record labels, and the band then decided to sign a record contract with Toshiba EMI, who sent the band to London to record their first album. Released in 1991, their memorable debut album &quot;Red Guitar And The Truth&quot; focused on topics such as juvenile delinquency, broken families, and the pain experienced by neglected children. Fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto, used the album to promote his 1991 Paris collection.

The band embarked on their first nationwide tour and released their second album &quot;Bang!&quot; in 1992, which received numerous album of the year awards by music publications. Blankey Jet City gained a reputation for shows that highlighted their raw, emotional sound, and the label duly brought out a live album in the same year.

The next two years set the pace for the bands prodigious output. Releasing their third album &quot;C.B. Jim&quot; in 1993, they again received acclaim from critics, when each song on the album was about the same fictitious person. Enjoying success, they released their fourth album &quot;Metal Moon&quot; during the same year, and quickly followed in 1994 with the release of their fifth album, which was more Jazz orientated than previous titles. Deciding the next step was to compile a selection of singles and re-recordings, they released a compilation titled &quot;The Six&quot; in 1995, and followed up with the album &quot;Skunk&quot; eight months later.

Taking a break from Blankey Jet City, Asai started his own indie label &quot;Sexy Stone Records&quot; in 1996, and formed the dream pop band &quot;Sherbets&quot; at the same time. Meanwhile, Nakamura started his own band &quot;Losalios&quot; with members from Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. After extended disagreements with Toshiba EMI, Blankey Jet City left the label and signed with Polydor to release their new surf-rock sounding album &quot;Love Flash Fever&quot; in 1997.

In 1998, another compilation was released, along with their eighth album . After four more hit singles, they released their final studio album &quot;Harlem Jets&quot; in May, 2000, followed by their swan-song &quot;Saturday Night&quot; within the next month. Their final live performance was at the Fuji Rock Festival on July 28, 2000, with the announcement that they wish to pursue indie careers.

<text>The field hockey tournament at the 1972 Summer Olympics was the 12th edition of the field hockey event at the Summer Olympics.

The West German victory was the first title by a European nation since 1920, but this was marred by the behavior of Pakistani players, fans, and officials: during the last ten minutes of the gold-medal match, the umpires had to stop play twice so that Pakistani fans who had invaded the pitch could be removed, while Pakistani players and officials repeatedly remonstrated with the umpires throughout that time. 

At the final whistle, Pakistani fans and officials invaded the pitch and assaulted West German police and stadium security before storming the tournament officials&#x27; table and pouring a bucket of water over International Hockey Federation president Rene Frank, while the players stormed their locker room before proceeding to destroy it.

At the medal ceremony, the Pakistani players refused to wear their silver medals or face the West German flag as it was raised, and turned their backs as the West German national anthem was played.

The eleven Pakistani players were banned for life from their national team, but after a high-level apology, the ban was reduced to two years, and eight of them played at the 1976 Olympics.
