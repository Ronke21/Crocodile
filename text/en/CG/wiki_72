<text>Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson (16 January 1853 – 6 November 1937) was an English actor and theatre manager and husband of actress Gertrude Elliott. He was considered the finest Hamlet of the Victorian era and one of the finest actors of his time, despite his dislike of the job and his lifelong belief that he was temperamentally unsuited to acting.

==Early life and education==
Born in London, he was the eldest of the eleven children of John Forbes-Robertson, a theatre critic and journalist from Aberdeen, and his wife Frances. One of his sisters, Frances (1866–1956), and two of his brothers, Ian Forbes-Robertson (1859–1936), Norman Forbes-Robertson (1858–1932) also became actors, with another brother, Eric Forbes-Robertson (1865–1935), becoming a notable artist. Through his wife Gertrude Elliott, he was the brother-in-law of famed actress Maxine Elliott, the uncle of Roy Harrod the economist, and he was also the great-uncle of actress Meriel Forbes (granddaughter of his brother Norman), who married actor Ralph Richardson.

He was educated at Charterhouse. Originally intending to become an artist, he trained for three years at the Royal Academy. He began a theatrical career, out of a desire to be self-supporting, when the dramatist William Gorman Wills, who had seen him in private theatricals, offered him a role in his play &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot;.

== Acting career ==
His many performances led him into, among other things, travel to the U.S., and work with Sir Henry Irving. He was hailed as one of the most individual and refined of English actors. He was a personal friend of the Duke of Sutherland and his family and often stayed with them at Trentham Hall; he is known to have recommended to them various writers and musicians in dire need of assistance.
Forbes-Robertson first came to prominence playing second leads to Henry Irving before making his mark in the role of Hamlet. One of his early successes was in W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Dan&#x27;l Druce, Blacksmith&quot;. In 1882, he starred with Lottie Venne and Marion Terry in G. W. Godfrey&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Parvenu&quot; at the Court Theatre. George Bernard Shaw wrote the part of Caesar in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; for him. Shaw stated:

I wrote &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; for Forbes-Robertson, because he is the classic actor of our day, and had a right to require such a service from me … Forbes-Robertson is the only actor I know who can find out the feeling of a speech from its cadence. His art meets the dramatist’s art directly, picking it up for completion and expression without explanations or imitations … Without him &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; would not have been written.


Forbes-Robertson&#x27;s other notable roles were Romeo, Othello, Leontes in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; and the leading role in &quot;The Passing of the Third Floor Back&quot;; performed on Broadway 1908 (filmed in 1916, released 1918). He did not play Hamlet until he was 44 years old, but after his success in the part he continued playing it until 1916, including a surviving silent film (1913). In a theatre review of Forbes-Robertson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hamlet&quot; published in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; (2 October 1897) George Bernard Shaw wrote:

Nothing half so charming has been seen by this generation. It will bear seeing again and again. … His intellect is the organ of his passion. His eternal self-criticism is alive and thrilling as it can possible be. … Mr. Forbes-Robertson’s own performance has a continuous charm, interest and variety, which are the result not only of his well-known grace and accomplishment as an actor, but of a genuine delight – the rarest thing on our stage – in Shakespeare’s art, and a natural familiarity with the plane of his imagination.

Forbes-Robertson was also a talented painter who did a portrait of his mentor Samuel Phelps that currently hangs in the Garrick Club in London. Forbes-Robertson acted in plays with the actress Mary Anderson in the 1880s. He became smitten with her, fell in love with her and asked her hand in marriage. She kindly turned him down though they remained friends. Later he and actress Beatrice Campbell enjoyed a brief affair during the time she starred with him in a series of Shakespearean plays in the mid-1890s.

On 26 November 1908 he chaired the inaugural meeting of the Actresses&#x27; Franchise League at the Criterion Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus, London. The first president of the league was Dame Madge Kendal and his wife Gertrude Elliott became the second president a year later. Forbes-Robertson was a regular speaker at events in support of suffrage.

Johnston Forbes-Robertson was knighted in 1913 at the age of 60, at which point he retired briefly from acting.

He returned to the stage, however, for his first farewell tour of the US in 1914–1915. It began in with a three-month run in New York, then traveled the country using eight rail road freight cars to carry the sets, costumes and properties for eight shows; and two passenger cars for the actors and personnel. His last appearance was at the Sanders Theatre in Boston with a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The second farewell tour followed; it traveled to 122 towns, beginning in Detroit in October 1915, with four plays. The tour traveled to Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco – where he learned of the birth of his fourth daughter, Diana. At this point they decided to reduce the itinerary to only three plays, by eliminating &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; from the repertoire. In his autobiography he describes how, on one early morning, the set, including the sphinx, was piled onto a beach and set on fire. The tour continued into Canada. His last performance as both Hamlet and as an actor, was in 1916 at the Sheldon Lecture Theatre of the University of Harvard, the stage of which had been made to replicate the stage of the Elizabethan Fortune Theatre especially for the Forbes-Robertson&#x27;s performance.

His literary works include &quot;The Life and Life-Work of Samuel Phelps&quot; (actor and theatre manager) as well as his own autobiography &quot;A Player Under Three Reigns&quot; (1925).

==Marriage and family==
In 1900, at age 47, he married American-born actress Gertrude Elliott (1874–1950), sister of Maxine Elliott, with whom he had four daughters.

* Their first daughter was Maxine Forbes-Robertson known as &#x27;Blossom&#x27;, who married the aircraft designer F. G. Miles and became a director and designer of the Miles Aircraft company. She previously married Inigo Freeman-Thomas, 2nd Marquess of Willingdon, in 1924; they divorced in 1932. 
* Their second daughter Jean Forbes-Robertson became an accomplished actress. Through Jean he is the grandfather of actress Joanna Van Gyseghem. 
* Their third daughter was Chloe Forbes-Robertson (1909–1947), an artist. 
* Diana Forbes-Robertson (1914–1988), their fourth daughter, was a writer who later wrote a biography of her aunt Maxine Elliott.

==Death and legacy==

On 6 November 1937 he died at St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay, near Dover, Kent, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, London on 9 November. Memorial services were held at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London.

A statue of Forbes-Robertson by Brenda Putnam (1932) can be found at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C.

<doc id="996468" wikidata="Q764714" url="?curid=996468" title="Operation Brevity">
<text>Operation Brevity was a limited offensive conducted in mid-May 1941, during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, Brevity was intended to be a rapid blow against weak Axis front-line forces in the Sollum–Capuzzo–Bardia area of the border between Egypt and Libya. Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day.

Egypt had been invaded by Libyan-based Italian forces in September 1940, but by February of the following year a British counter-offensive had advanced well into Libya, destroying the Italian Tenth Army in the process. British attention then shifted to Greece, which was under the threat of Axis invasion. While Allied divisions were being diverted from North Africa, the Italians reinforced their positions and were supported by the arrival of the German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; under &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Erwin Rommel. Rapidly taking the offensive against his distracted and over-stretched opponent, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth forces in Cyrenaica back across the Egyptian border. Although the battlefront now lay in the border area, the port city of Tobruk— inside Libya—had resisted the Axis advance, and its substantial Australian and British garrison constituted a significant threat to Rommel&#x27;s lengthy supply chain. He therefore committed his main strength to besieging the city, leaving the front line only thinly held.

Wavell defined Operation Brevity&#x27;s main objectives as the acquisition of territory from which to launch a further planned offensive toward Tobruk, and the depletion of German and Italian forces in the region. With limited battle-ready units to draw on in the wake of Rommel&#x27;s recent successes, on 15 May Brigadier William Gott attacked in three columns with a mixed infantry and armoured force. The strategically important Halfaya Pass was taken against stiff Italian opposition, and deeper inside Libya Fort Capuzzo was captured, but German counter-attacks under Colonel Maximilian von Herff regained the fort during the afternoon causing heavy casualties amongst its defenders. Gott—concerned that his forces were in danger of being caught by German armour in open ground—conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May, and Brevity was closed down. The importance of the Halfaya Pass as a safe supply route was highlighted to Rommel, and 11 days later it was recaptured during Operation Skorpion, a German counter-attack.

==Background==
In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army based in Libya conducted the Italian invasion of Egypt and three months later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 due to supply shortages and because priority had been given to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn and sent to the Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped and in the case of the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.
The Italians sent the 132nd Armored Division &quot;Ariete&quot; and 102nd Motorized Division &quot;Trento&quot; to North Africa. From February 1941 until early May, Operation Sonnenblume saw the arrival of the German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; in Tripoli to reinforce their Italian allies. Commanded by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Erwin Rommel and consisting of the 5th Light and 15th Panzer Division, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; was to block British attempts to drive the Italians out of the region. Rommel seized on the weakness of his opponents and without waiting for his forces fully to assemble, rapidly went on the offensive. During March and April, the remaining units of the 2nd Armoured Division were destroyed as the Axis forces advanced, which also forced the British and Commonwealth forces into retreat.

Neame and the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt—Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor—were captured and the British command structure had to be reorganised. HQ Cyrenaica was dissolved on 14 April and its command functions taken over by a new HQ Western Desert Force (Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse). The 9th Australian Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of Tobruk and the remaining British forces withdrew a further east to Sollum on the Egypt–Libya border. With the main Axis force conducting the siege of Tobruk a small battlegroup (&quot;Kampfgruppe&quot;) commanded by Colonel Maximilian von Herff continued to press eastwards. Capturing Fort Capuzzo and Bardia in passing, it then advanced into Egypt; by the end of April it had taken Sollum and the tactically important Halfaya Pass. Rommel garrisoned these positions, reinforced the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; and ordered it onto the defensive.

The Tobruk garrison received supplies from the Royal Navy and Rommel was unable to take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were at the end of a long supply route from Tripoli, threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the British had the initiative.

==Prelude==
General Archibald Wavell—the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell intended to create advantageous conditions from which to launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity&#x27;s primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel&#x27;s forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although only as far as supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.

===Allied force===
Operation Brevity would be carried out by the 22nd Guards Brigade and elements of the 7th Armoured Division. Its armoured component consisted of 29 cruiser tanks of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2nd RTR) and 24 infantry tanks of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4th RTR). The Royal Air Force (RAF) allocated all its fighters and a small force of bombers to the operation. Brigadier William Gott—in command of all Allied front-line forces since the retreat—was to lead the operation and his plan was to advance in three parallel columns.
On the desert flank to the south, the 7th Armoured Brigade group was to move from Bir el Khireigat to Sidi Azeiz destroying any opposition encountered en route. This group included three small mobile forces (&quot;Jock columns&quot;) of the 7th Support Group, the cruiser tanks of 2nd RTR, and the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars, whose task was to patrol the open desert on the left flank and monitor the Sidi Azeiz–Bardia road. In the centre, the 22nd Guards Brigade group was to clear the top of the Halfaya Pass, secure Bir Wair, Musaid, and Fort Capuzzo, and conduct a company-sized probe toward Bardia. The group included two infantry formations (1st Battalion Durham Light Infantry and 2nd Battalion Scots Guards) and the infantry tanks of 4th RTR. In the north, the coast group was to advance along the coast road, capturing the lower Halfaya Pass, Sollum barracks, and the town of Sollum. The group included elements of the 2nd Battalion The Rifle Brigade, and the 8th Field Regiment Royal Artillery.

===Axis force===
The main Axis opposition was , positioned on the desert plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion, Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the &quot;Trento&quot; Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of —well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support. On 9 May, the Germans intercepted a British weather report over the radio. The war diary noted that &quot;In the past, such reports had always been issued prior to the important enemy offensives to capture Sidi Barrani, Bardi, Tobruk, and the Gebel&quot;. Rommel strengthened the eastern side of his cordon around Tobruk as a precaution against sorties from the garrison and to order to adopt a more aggressive posture. On 13 May, Axis aircraft bombed British tank concentrations and Herff expected an imminent British attack. On the following day aircraft were unable to locate the British, and it was reported that the &quot;enemy intentions to attack were not known&quot;.

==Battle==

===Centre column===
On 13 May, Wavell&#x27;s infantry battalions began to concentrate at their start lines, followed by the tank regiments during the early hours of 15 May. At 06:00, the three columns began their advance, supported overhead by a standing patrol of Hawker Hurricane fighters. Reaching the top of the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group ran into heavy opposition from a company of the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the found their 47 mm anti-tank guns could not penetrate the armour of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets, aiming at the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks, seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class. At the cost of the seven tanks, the position was taken by C Squadron 4th RTR and G Company 2nd Scots Guards and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken in the face of sporadic opposition.
A Squadron 4th RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) continued the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged A Squadron, disabling five tanks, but were forced to withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4th RTR&#x27;s tanks and 1DLI&#x27;s leading C Company, and the attack on the fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that C Company, reunited with A Squadron 4th RTR and reinforced by A and B Companies 1DLI, eventually took the position. D Company 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground to the north of the fort.

In the afternoon, one company of the 2nd Scots Guards probed toward Bardia, the infantry coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as they neared Sollum barracks. A group of Universal Carriers—commanded by Sergeant F. Riley—charged the gun positions and quickly neutralised them, but one carrier was disabled when the group was subsequently engaged by anti-tank guns. Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the Military Medal, the battalion&#x27;s first decoration of the war.

===Desert column===
On the desert flank, 2nd RTR advanced with the 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received of up to 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and A Squadron 2nd RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One Panzer IV was disabled and the other two driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to mechanical failure. A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No 2 Troop, destroying a Panzer III and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of A Squadron 2nd RTR began a reconnaissance patrol towards Sidi Azeiz.

===Coastal column===
The advance along the coastal road—which lacked tank support—was held up all morning by determined Italian resistance at the bottom of Halfaya Pass. This objective was finally achieved toward evening when S Company 2nd Rifle Brigade—supported by Australian anti-tank gunners fighting as infantry—overran the Italian positions taking around 130 prisoners.

===Axis reactions===
Although the German and Italian commands in North Africa knew that a British offensive was imminent, Operation Brevity nevertheless caught them unprepared, and Rommel recorded in his diary that the initial attacks had caused him considerable losses. By midday on 15 May, Axis command was showing signs of confusion. It was erroneously believed that the offensive involved more than 100 tanks, and repeated requests were made to both the and the for a concerted effort to defeat it. Forces around Tobruk were redeployed east of the besieged city, to block any attempt at relief and to prevent the garrison from breaking out to meet the British advance. Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Cramer was sent to reinforce with a tank battalion from Panzer Regiment 8 and a battery of anti-aircraft guns, and additional reinforcements under General Hans-Karl Freiherr von Esebeck were despatched the following day.

The Germans concentrated their riposte against the central column. Herff—who had been prepared to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5. At around 13:30, D Company 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment 5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.

On the desert flank, A Squadron 2nd RTR&#x27;s patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being monitored by Panzer Regiment 5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, and reported that an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. A Squadron&#x27;s patrol was interpreted as an attempt to concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff&#x27;s force and unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to join up with Cramer&#x27;s Panzer Regiment 8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.

===British withdrawal===

Realising that the 22nd Guards Brigade group would be vulnerable to German armoured counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during the early hours of the morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being.

Cramer&#x27;s reinforcements arrived in the Sidi Azeiz area at 03:00 and reached Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he made contact with but by mid-morning both groups had run out of fuel. The German advance resumed at 16:00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2nd RTR. The British reported one German tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted, while the Germans believed that they had repulsed a strong British tank attack. As nightfall approached, Herff broke off the action and went on to the defensive. He intended to repair his damaged machines, reorganise, and resume offensive operations on 18 May. 2nd RTR pulled back to Bir el Khireigat, initially followed by two German tanks, one of which withdrew after the other was destroyed. The regiment arrived at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days previously, at around 02:30 on 17 May.

==Aftermath==

Operation Brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives, succeeding only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, wounded or captured. The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded. Losses among the 2nd Rifle Brigade are unknown. German casualties numbered three tanks (a Panzer II and two Panzer IIIs, although several more suffered minor damage) and 258 men killed, wounded or captured. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place total Italian losses at 395. Allied accounts record the capture of 347 of these men.

On 5 August, Herff praised the &quot;Bersaglieri&quot;, who had defended Halfaya Pass &quot;...with lionlike courage until the last man against stronger enemy forces. The greatest part of them died faithful to the flag&quot;. Lieutenant Giacinto Cova, a platoon commander in the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, received a posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valour, Italy&#x27;s highest award for bravery. The medal citation reported that Cova had organised a counter-attack and was killed attempting to throw a hand-held bomb at a British tank. The British received plaudits from Winston Churchill, who sent a telegram to Wavell betraying his ignorance of events by stating: &quot;Without using the Tiger cubs you have taken the offensive, advanced , captured Halfaya and Sollum, taken 500 German prisoners and inflicted heavy losses in men and tanks. For this twenty I tanks and 1,000 or 1,500 casualties do not seem too heavy a cost.&quot; Churchill ended the message by asking Wavell &quot;What are your dates for bringing Tiger cubs into action?&quot;, in reference to the reinforcements that had arrived at Alexandria on 12 May as part of a convoy code-named Operation Tiger. The 11th Hussar&#x27;s regimental history notes that &quot;it was clear that no further offensive action would be possible before 7[th] Armoured Division was fully prepared&quot;. The Tiger convoy brought 238 tanks and made it possible to refit the 7th Armoured Division, which had been out of action since February as a result of the losses it sustained during Operation Compass. Preparations could now be made for Operation Battleaxe and the relief of Tobruk. In the system of British and Commonwealth battle honours, units that served in the Halfaya Pass area between 15 and 27 May were awarded the honour &quot;Halfaya 1941&quot; in 1957.

The historian, Thomas Jentz, suggests that Brevity could have ended in victory for the British. While their tank forces were fighting ineffectively, the &quot;gutsy&quot; actions by 2nd RTR and their patrol toward Sidi Azeiz had convinced the Germans that the battle was lost by the evening of 15 May. Because of their failure to engage 2nd RTR late that day, several German commanders from Panzer Regiment 5, including its commanding officer, were removed from their posts after the battle. Jentz notes that a feint by the 1st and 7th RTR out of Tobruk might have caused a realignment of the Axis forces, weakening their overall position and perhaps even forcing them to give up the Sollum area.

Operation Brevity highlighted to Rommel the importance of the Halfaya Pass; whichever side held it would have a &quot;comparatively safe route for his supplies&quot; during offensives in the area. On 27 May, he launched Operation Skorpion, during which Herff recaptured the pass and reversed the last British territorial gain from Brevity.

The town was founded at the start of the 19th century by John D&#x27;Arcy who lived in Clifden Castle (built around 1818, now a ruin) west of Clifden. He had inherited the estate in 1804 when it was mostly inhabited by fishermen and farmers. The idea of establishing a town on the coast was first voiced by him in 1812. Bad communications and a lack of private capital prevented fast progress until the 1820s when the potato crop failed in 1821–22 and D&#x27;Arcy petitioned the government in Dublin for assistance. The engineer Alexander Nimmo was sent to the area in 1822. He constructed a quay at Clifden (finished in 1831) and started a road to Galway. With these improvements to its infrastructure, the town began to grow.
It prospered until, in 1839, John D&#x27;Arcy died. By that time, Clifden had grown from virtually nothing to a town of 185 dwellings, most of them three-floored, two churches, two hotels, three schools, a police barracks, courthouse, a gaol, a distillery and 23 pubs. The population had grown to 1,100 and the town already sported the (as yet unpaved) triangle of streets still visible today. Products that were shipped out from Clifden Harbour included marble, corn, fish and kelp. However, John&#x27;s son and heir, Hyacinth, lacked his father&#x27;s abilities and confrontations with his tenants became commonplace. In 1843, Daniel O&#x27;Connell held a &#x27;Monster Meeting&#x27; at Clifden, attended by a crowd reportedly numbering 100,000, at which he spoke on repeal of the Act of Union.

The town&#x27;s surging growth and prosperity came to an end when the famine started in 1845. Large numbers of people died, as government help proved insufficient to deal with starvation, scurvy and other diseases. By 1848 90% of the population was on relief (receiving government money). Landlords went bankrupt as rents dried up. Many people emigrated to America. On 18 November 1850, Hyacinth D&#x27;Arcy put up his estates for sale and most of them were purchased by Charles and Thomas Eyre of Somerset. Hyacinth pursued a church career and became Rector of Omey and Clifden. Charles Eyre sold his share to his brother, who gave the estates to his nephew (Charles&#x27; son) John Joseph in 1864.

From 1848, the evangelical Protestant Irish Church Missions were actively proselytising, seeking to convert Catholics. In 1852, their first mission church was established at Moyard Bridge, Ballinakill, Clifden, also the ICM set up orphanages, Glenowen for girls and Ballyconree for boys (opened in 1849), in Clifden, Ballyconree was burnt down in 1922. The mission in Clifden was supported by Hyacinth D&#x27;Arcy, the landlord of Clifden Castle, and, following his bankruptcy, by the Eyre family who bought the estate.

In 1855, Sisters of Mercy from Galway came to Clifden and established St Joseph&#x27;s Convent, followed by an orphanage and St Joseph&#x27;s Industrial School in 1858.

===Early 20th century===
====Wireless telegraphy and transatlantic flight====

Clifden gained prominence after 1905 when Guglielmo Marconi decided to build his first high power transatlantic long wave wireless telegraphy station four miles (6 km) south of the town to minimize the distance to its sister station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The first point-to-point fixed wireless service connecting Europe with North America opened for public service with the transmission of 10,000 words on 17 October 1907. At peak times, up to 200 people were employed by the Clifden wireless station, among them Jack Phillips, who later perished as Chief Radio Operator on the &quot;Titanic&quot;.
On 15 June 1919 the first non-stop transatlantic flight by Alcock and Brown crashlanded in Derrygimlagh bog, close to Marconi&#x27;s transatlantic wireless station. When Captain Alcock spotted the green bog he thought it was a meadow where he could safely land his Vickers Vimy biplane. The aircraft&#x27;s landing gear sank into the soft bog and was destroyed. Alcock and Brown were later transported back to Clifden town by stagecoach with only minor injuries. When they returned using the Marconi Railway, the locals had helped themselves to parts of the aircraft as souvenirs.

====War of Independence (1920–1921)====
Events that would lead up to the &quot;Burning of Clifden&quot; began on 21 November 1920, Bloody Sunday. On that day, an IRA unit known as The Squad shot a number of British officers and civilians believed to work for military intelligence unit known as the Cairo Gang, killing eleven and wounding four. Later that day, British paramilitaries from the Auxiliary Division opened fire during what was intended to be a routine search for IRA suspects during a Gaelic football match at Croke Park, killing twelve and injuring sixty. Thomas Whelan, born in 1899 in Clifden, was arrested and charged with the Bloody Sunday assassination of British military prosecutor Captain G.T. Bagelly. Although Whelan recognised the court, pled not guilty, introduced witnesses attesting to his presence elsewhere, and maintained that he was not involved in the assassination, he was found guilty and hanged on 14 March 1921. Following its &quot;two for one&quot; policy that required the killing of two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) for every Republican executed, the West Connemara flying column of the IRA fatally shot RIC Constables Charles Reynolds and Thomas Sweeney at Eddie King&#x27;s Corner on 16 March 1921. In response to the RIC&#x27;s request for assistance through the Marconi wireless station, a trainload of Black and Tans arrived via the Galway to Clifden railway in the early hours of St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1921, and proceeded to &quot;burn, plunder and murder&quot;. They killed one civilian, seriously injured another, burned 14 houses, and damaged several others.

====Civil war (1922)====
When the Civil War started in June 1922, Connemara was controlled by the Republican Anti-Treaty IRA. In Clifden, the population tolerated the Republicans but did not support them. The Republicans occupied several buildings. In addition, all petrol was confiscated, roads barricaded and made impassable, railway bridges were blown up and telegraph lines cut. Newspapers were forbidden.

The Republicans also burned the buildings they evacuated. In Clifden, the workhouse was burned in July. In addition, on 25 July, the Republicans set fire to the Marconi Station and fired shots at it because they considered the station &quot;a British concern&quot;, and because the RIC had used the station to marshall reinforcements in March 1921. Transatlantic wireless service was transferred from Clifden to the more modern Marconi wireless station near Waunfawr, Wales. By one reckoning, the station&#x27;s closure caused an estimated 1,000 local people to lose their livelihood.

The National Army sent 150 men who, in the night of 14/15 August, marched to town. However, the Republicans retreated and there was only minimal fighting. The National troops were warmly welcomed by the people of Clifden.
The Republicans still controlled the mountains and waged a guerrilla war against the National Army. The Republicans attacked National Army posts and patrols, mainly by sniping, and attacked motor cars. On 13 October, Republicans burned down the Recess Hotel and nearby Glendalough House to prevent the National troops from using them as billets.
On 29 October, the Republicans recaptured Clifden from the around 100 National troops stationed there. The attacking force consisted of around 350 men. They also had with them an &quot;armoured car&quot;, called &quot;The Queen of the West&quot;. This was used to advance towards a defended barracks building. Eventually, the National troops surrendered. However, the Republicans did not occupy the town, which had sustained some damage during the fighting. Communications were once again severed, and the Republicans took up positions around the town.

Finally, on 16 December, the National Army returned to Clifden and the Republicans once again slipped away before their arrival. The townspeople again welcomed the National Army and soon repairs started on bridges and the Galway to Clifden railway line. Soon after, the first train in seven months arrived in Clifden.

==Transport==
===Road===
The N59 road from Galway (77 km away) to Westport, County Mayo (64 km) passes through the town.

Regular coach services are provided by Bus Éireann and Citylink, connecting Clifden with Galway city. 
Some bus services operate through Oughterard, to the south of Lough Corrib, while others operate via Clonbur / Headford to the north of Lough Corrib.

===Rail===

Beginning 1 July 1895, Clifden railway station was the western terminus of the Midland Great Western Railway Galway to Clifden line. The line closed in 1935.

===Airport===
In 1989, a group of Clifden businessmen issued shares for a company and applied for planning permission for a 1,200-metre runway and associated buildings at Ardagh. A group of locals began to campaign against this proposal, later calling themselves &quot;Save Roundstone Bog&quot;. Galway County Council refused planning permission for the airport due to feared damage to the natural beauty of the area, and because it was designated an &#x27;Area of International Scientific Importance&#x27; (ASI). The &#x27;Clifden Airport Co.&#x27; appealed and as a consequence of the legal proceedings, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, ASI designations were found to be unconstitutional. The company later proposed to exchange the site at Ardagh for part of the Marconi site at Derrygimlagh. However, this also failed due to local and nationwide opposition. Eventually, a smaller 600-metre runway was suggested at Cloon near Cleggan. This runway was built in 2008 and the airfield was supposed to be used for flights to Inishbofin. It has been assigned the airport code EICD but by 2012 it had not been opened for traffic.

==Economy==

Clifden is the main town in Connemara; therefore it is home to a range of services. The HQ for the Connemara Garda Siochana service is in Clifden and the main fire station for Connemara is in Clifden.

There is a public library serving the area which offers material relating to local history. The library hosts an ongoing programme of exhibitions, readings and other cultural events.

There are three supermarkets in Clifden and 13 pubs.

==Religion==
Clifden lies within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tuam and the Church of Ireland Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, and its Omey Union Parish. Clifden has two churches: St. Joseph&#x27;s (Roman Catholic), completed in 1879, and Christ Church (Church of Ireland), built in 1853, replacing an earlier structure dating to 1810. 

The St. Patrick Orthodox Mission, part of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, was opened in October 2023.

==In literature==
Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s novel &quot;Atomised&quot; is partly set in Clifden.

==Notable people==

* John Patrick Riley (c.1817–c.1850), a Clifden native, deserted from the United States Army after experiencing anti-Catholicism in the United States and what he said was &quot;religious persecution&quot; by U.S. officers. Riley became a major in the Mexican Army with the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, a unit of about 200 European immigrants and expatriates, many of whom had deserted from the U.S. army during the Mexican–American War. Clifden commemorates Riley with a bronze street sculpture and the town flies the Mexican flag annually on 12 September.
* John Bamlet Smallman (1849–1916), an Irish-Canadian businessman, was born in Clifden.
* Thomas Whelan (1898–1921), an IRA Volunteer executed by hanging at Mountjoy Gaol during the Irish War of Independence. Now buried as one of The Forgotten Ten at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. A ceremony still commemorates Whelan every year in his native Clifden.

<doc id="996486" wikidata="Q2024169" url="?curid=996486" title="Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld">
<text>Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld (Désirée Elisabeth Sibylla; born 2 June 1938) is a member of the Swedish royal family. She is the third child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and an elder sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf.

==Early life==
Désirée was born on 2 June 1938 as the third daughter and child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (son of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and his late wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught) and his wife, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (daughter of Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife, Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein).

Desiree was christened on 30 June 1938 at Solna Church in the Solna Municipality of Stockholm, Sweden. She was given the names: Desiree after her ancestor Queen Desideria and Sibylla after her mother, Princess Sibylla.

She grew up at the family home, Haga Palace outside Stockholm, with her three sisters; together they were known as the &quot;Haga Princesses&quot;.

In November 1960, Désirée accompanied her elder sister Princess Birgitta for a visit to the United States on behalf of their grandfather King Gustaf VI Adolf for the 50th anniversary of The American-Scandinavian Foundation. In their honour a ball was organised for the two princesses at the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel in Chicago by Mayor Richard Daley.

==Marriage and children==

Désirée&#x27;s engagement to Baron Nils-August Otto Carl &quot;Niclas&quot; Silfverschiöld, (1934–2017) was announced on 18 December 1963, and the couple married on 5 June 1964 in Storkyrkan in Stockholm. As a result of her non-royal marriage, she lost her style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and her position as a princess of Sweden, but was given the courtesy &quot;Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld&quot; by the King. Under the Swedish constitution of that time, she, as a woman, and her descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne, and when this was later changed to absolute primogeniture the right of succession was limited to the descendants of her brother, King Carl XVI Gustaf.

Désirée and her husband had three children:

* Baron &quot;Carl&quot; Otto Edmund Silfverschiöld (born 22 March 1965 in Gothenburg), married Maria Gunilla Fredriksson (born 12 April 1965 in Malmö) in 2005 and has one daughter.
* Baroness &quot;Christina&quot; Louise Ewa Madeleine Silfverschiöld (born 29 September 1966 in Gothenburg), married Baron Hans Louis Gerard de Geer af Finspång (born 26 January 1963 in Stockholm) in 1999 and has three children.
* Baroness &quot;Hélène&quot; Ingeborg Sibylla Silfverschiöld (born 20 September 1968 in Gothenburg), who served as bridesmaid at the 1976 weddings of her uncle King Carl XVI Gustaf and granduncle Prince Bertil. In a relationship with Fredrik Dieterle has one son.

Since her marriage, Désirée has lived in the family&#x27;s home at Koberg Castle and at Gåsevadholm Castle in Halland. She is the godmother of her niece, Crown Princess Victoria.

==Later life==
Désirée has occasionally attended Nobel Prize festivities and public royal events in a semi-official capacity, sometimes wearing tiaras and jewelry belonging to the royal family. She also represented Sweden in first receiving Emperor Akihito of Japan when he arrived for a state visit in 2000. She was widowed in 2017.

In 2023, Désirée was hospitalised at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for several months due to meningitis.

<doc id="996488" wikidata="Q1296537" url="?curid=996488" title="European Baccalaureate">
<text>The European Baccalaureate (or EB) is a bilingual educational diploma, which certifies the completion of secondary studies in a European School or Accredited European School by the Board of Governors of the intergovernmental organisation, &quot;The European Schools&quot;. 
The diploma is awarded for the successful achievement of coursework and concomitant examinations which require that students take a minimum of 10 courses as well as be fully proficient in two languages. Students may take up to 14 courses. It is officially recognised as an entry qualification for Higher Education in all the member states of the European Union (EU), as well as in a number of others. All participating countries are legally obligated to ensure EB diploma holders enjoy the same rights and benefits as other holders of secondary school-leaving certificates in their jurisdictions.
The name ‘European Baccalaureate’ belongs solely to the European Schools, which, since their establishment, have had a monopoly over its use in all the official languages of the EU. (This diploma should not be confused with other types of educational qualifications which also bear the name &quot;Baccalaureate&quot; like the &quot;International Baccalaureate&quot;. In German, the European Baccalaureate is called the &quot;Europäisches Abitur&quot;, not to be confused with the German Abitur.)

== Overview ==
The European Baccalaureate is a bilingual diploma taken at the end of the seventh year of secondary education. Students must study a minimum of ten subjects and are examined by means of written and oral examinations and by continuous assessment. The EB may only be awarded to students who have completed their secondary school education within either one of the thirteen European Schools, established by the intergovernmental organisation, &quot;The European Schools&quot;, or one of the fourteen schools under national jurisdiction which have received the status of an Accredited European School by the Board of Governors of the European Schools. The EB should be distinguished from the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the baccalaureates of various national systems. Details of the examination are set out in the Annex of the Statute of the European School and in the Regulations for the EB, available from the schools.

The EB is administered and directly supervised by an external examining board appointed annually by the Board of Governors. The examining board consists of up to three representatives of each member state, who must satisfy the conditions governing the appointment of equivalent examining boards in their respective countries. It is presided over by a senior university educator appointed by each member state in turn, assisted by a member of the Board of Inspectors of the schools.

Article 5 (2) of the Statute provides that holders of the Baccalaureate shall:

*enjoy, in the member state of which they are nationals, all the benefits attaching to the possession of the diploma or certificate awarded at the end of secondary school education in that country; and
*be entitled to seek admission to any university in the territory of any member state on the same terms as nationals of that member state with equivalent qualifications

The EB is a two-year course and assesses the performance of students in the subjects taught in secondary years 6–7.

The first awards of the EB were made in 1959.

The EB is marked in percentages out of 100, and, in contrast to many national systems (e.g. British A-Levels), comprises a wide range of compulsory subjects and 3–5 elective subjects. Compulsory studies include mother tongue, 1st foreign language, mathematics (5 hours/week or 3 hours/week course), philosophy, one science subject, history and geography (both taught in the 1st foreign language), and gym. These also depend on the orientation that the pupil has chosen at the end of year 5. The choice of elective subjects is large (see the list below), although the subject may not be available if the class size is too small.

A minimum of 31 periods a week must be taken, with a maximum of 35 periods, although this is sometimes extended to 36 or even 37 periods.
At least 2 Column 3 subjects must be chosen; a maximum of 4 can be taken. There is a core of compulsory subjects which include language 1 (mother tongue), language 2 (first foreign language), mathematics, history, geography, philosophy, religion/ethics and sport. In addition, if no science subject is taken as an elective subject, a science subject must be taken as a compulsory subject. Students must take a minimum of ten courses. They have the choice of two elective subjects of four lessons per week and may take as many as four additional subjects in addition to the ten compulsory subjects. These subjects may include each of the separate sciences, social sciences, Latin, art, music, philosophy and languages 3 and 4. Mathematics can be taken as a 3-lesson or 5-lesson per week course. Additional advanced courses of three lessons per week may be taken in mathematics, language 1 and language 2. Students may also choose complementary courses of two lessons per week such as practical science, introductory economics, art, music and theatre.

The total mark consists of:
* 20% coursework from 7th year
* 30% written exams in January
* 15% oral exams in June (where applicable)
* 35% written exams in June

Consequently, there is a heavy workload for the students; the system enforces not only a rounded knowledge of all subjects but also allows students to specialise in individual fields. Students are obliged to have a strong skills in one foreign language (in years 2-5 of secondary school a 2nd foreign language is also compulsory). The final pass-rate is very high (almost always over 98%), in part due to the practice of &#x27;weeding out&#x27; candidates who are not academically strong enough to complete the Baccalaureate.

This process starts from an early age whereby many pupils either leave, are asked to leave or fall foul of the &#x27;three strikes&#x27; rule (fail a year 3 times and the student will be asked to leave). Failing the same year twice also means leaving the school. Failing and repeating a year is a fairly common occurrence from age 10 upwards; roughly up to 5% of pupils will fail in each year. The 5th year is comparable to the German &#x27;Mittlere Reife&#x27; or British GCSEs.

However, the pluridisciplinarity the EB offers is advantageous to students wishing to go on to university studies, in France and Germany especially. Most of the English section students and a significant minority of students from the other language sections apply to British universities. Recent experience (2011–2012 and beyond) has shown that students applying to British universities are encountering growing difficulties, sometimes serious, in having their Baccalaureate qualifications adequately recognised.

== Difficulty ==
This reflects the demanding nature of the examination process and the fact that students need to perform very well across a very broad range of subjects and be fully bilingual. The bilingual demands of the course work and concomitant examinations entail that monolingual students cannot pass.

== Compulsory bilingual education ==
The ten compulsory courses include a mother tongue and a second language. Students are also obliged to take a third language in years 1 to 5 upon entry into secondary level education. Students must be highly skilled in two languages. They must take literature classes in both their first language and their second. Although some obligatory classes such as philosophy, biology and mathematics are taught in the students&#x27; mother tongue, other compulsory courses such as history and geography are taught in the second language ensuring students are fully bilingual. This insistence on bilingual course work and examination makes it difficult for non-bilingual new entrants to succeed.

== Evaluation ==
In a 2006 study based on a sample of over 500 former European School pupils, Kelly and Kelly compared the performances at British and Irish universities of students who had participated in the EB with the performances of students who had undertaken the dominant UK equivalent qualification, A-levels.

This showed that in terms of the probability of getting a good degree, an EB score of:
* 80 or more was roughly equivalent to 380 Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) points awarded for A-levels (3 A grades).
* 70 to 79 was equivalent to a UCAS score of 340-360 (ABB to AAB)
* 60 to 69 was equivalent to 300-320 UCAS points (BBC, BBB).

The study concluded that EB participants were disadvantaged by the then current official equivalency system for converting their mark into UCAS points, with even students with a bare pass at the EB (60-64) more likely to get a good degree at university than students who achieved 280-300 UCAS points (BBC, BCC, CCC). Kelly and Kelly remarked that students undertaking the EB received unrealistic offers when applying to UK universities, with admissions offices failing to understand how seldom an EB score of 90+% is awarded. They found that the UK National Recognition Information Centre had incorrectly assumed that a fail mark in the EB (below 60%) was equivalent to a fail mark within the A-level qualification, (2 E grades or below 40%). Similarly, Kelly and Kelly concluded that the Irish Central Applications Office had also compiled an incorrect table of equivalencies for the EB with the Irish Leaving Certificate.

<text>Richard Andree (26 February 1835 – 22 February 1912) was a German geographer and cartographer, noted for devoting himself especially to ethnographic studies. He wrote numerous books on this subject, dealing notably with the races of his own country, while an important general work was &quot;Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche&quot; (Stuttgart, 1878).

==Biography==
Andree was born in Braunschweig, the son of geographer Karl Andree (1808–1875). He followed in the footsteps of his father, studied natural sciences at the Braunschweig Collegium Carolinum and Leipzig University, and temporarily worked in a Bohemian ironworks. As a director of the geography bureau of publisher Velhagen &amp; Klasing in Leipzig from 1873 to 1890, he also took up cartography, having a chief share in the production of the &quot;Physikalisch-Statistischer Atlas des Deutschen Reichs&quot; (together with Oscar Peschel, Leipzig, 1877) and the &quot;Allgemeiner Historischer Handatlas&quot;, (with Gustav Droysen, son of Johann Gustav Droysen, Leipzig, 1886) as well as school atlases. 

Andree&#x27;s main work, however, is his &quot;Allgemeiner Handatlas&quot; (Leipzig, first edition 1881, final edition 1937), one of the most comprehensive world atlases of all times. The early editions of the &quot;Times Atlas of the World&quot; (1895-1900) are based on this atlas, as was Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Universal Atlas.&quot; Andree became an elected member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1886. In 1890 he moved to Heidelberg, where he continued the editorship of the academic journal &quot;Globus&quot; from 1891 until 1903. Andree made important contributions to comparative ethnographic studies of countries and people, advocating Adolf Bastian&#x27;s ideas of a common basic mental framework shared by all humans. His work also influenced Arnošt Muka&#x27;s studies of the Sorbian culture.

In 1903, Andree married Marie Eysn who became known as Marie Andree-Eysn. Andree died aged 76 in Munich, which had been the couple&#x27;s hometown since 1904.

<doc id="996491" wikidata="Q855330" url="?curid=996491" title="Donegal (town)">
<text>Donegal ( ; , &quot;fort of the foreigners&quot;) is a town in County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. Although Donegal gave its name to the county, now Lifford is the county town. From the 15th until the early 17th century, Donegal was the &quot;capital&quot; of Tyrconnell, a Gaelic kingdom controlled by the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty of the Northern Uí Néill. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

Donegal is in South Donegal and is located at the mouth of the River Eske and Donegal Bay, which is overshadowed by the Blue Stack Mountains (&quot;the Croaghs&quot;). The Drumenny Burn, which flows along the eastern edge of Donegal Town, flows into the River Eske on the north-eastern edge of the town, between the Community Hospital and The Northern Garage. The Ballybofey Road (the R267) crosses the Drumenny Burn near where it flows into the River Eske. The town is bypassed by the N15 and N56 roads. The centre of the town, known as The Diamond, is a hub for music, poetic and cultural gatherings in the area. There is a memorial to the Four Masters in the centre of the Diamond.

==History==
There is archaeological evidence for settlements around the town dating to prehistoric times, including the remains of ringforts and other defensive earthworks.

Donegal Town itself is famous for being the former centre of government of the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty, the great Gaelic royal family who ruled Tyrconnell in west Ulster for centuries and who played a pivotal role in Irish history. Their original homeland lay further to the north in the area of Kilmacrennan. From the 15th to the 17th century, they were an important part of the opposition to the colonisation of Ireland by England. The town itself contains Donegal Castle, on the banks of the River Eske, and the remains of Donegal Abbey, a Franciscan abbey which dates back to the 15th century on the Southern shore of the Bay. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; may have been partially written in the old abbey in the 1630s. The story of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, Lord of Tyrconnell, was the inspiration behind many books and films, not least, Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Fighting Prince of Donegal&quot;.

In 1601 the Siege of Donegal took place during the Nine Years&#x27; War. After the Flight of the Earls from near Rathmullan in September 1607, the castle and its lands were seized by the English Crown and given to an Englishman, Captain Basil Brooke, as part of the Plantation of Ulster. Captain (later Sir) Basil Brooke (ancestor of the Viscounts Brookeborough) was granted the castle around 1611 and he proceeded to carry out major reconstruction work and added a wing to the castle in the Jacobean style. The current plan of the town was also laid out by Brooke, including an attractive town square known as &quot;The Diamond&quot;. From the late 17th until the early 20th centuries, Donegal Town formed part of the vast estates of the Gore family (from 1762 Earls of Arran in the Peerage of Ireland) and it was during their ownership that the town took on its present appearance. Donegal Borough returned two members to the Irish House of Commons, the lower house of the Parliament of Ireland, until the Acts of Union 1800 came into force in January 1801. Evidence of the Great Famine still exists, including a workhouse, whose buildings are now part of the local hospital, and many famine graves.

==Buildings of note==
===Donegal Castle===
Donegal Castle was the stronghold of the O&#x27;Donnells. It has been restored by the Office of Public Works.

===St. Patrick&#x27;s Church of the Four Masters===
Dedicated to Saint Patrick and &quot;the Four Masters&quot;, this Catholic church was built in the early 1930s and was completed in 1935. Known locally as &quot;the Chapel&quot; or &quot;the Town Chapel&quot;, it was designed by Ralph Byrne, the famous Dublin architect, in a mixed neo-Irish Romanesque and neo-Gothic style.

===Donegal Parish Church===
This Church of Ireland church was built in a simple Gothic style mainly in the late 1820s and was completed in 1828. The main church appears to have been designed by a Mr Graham of Donegal Town. A chancel was added in 1890. The chancel of 1890 was designed by the office of J. Guy Ferguson in Derry and built in a neo-Gothic style by James McClean builders from Strabane.

==Industry and tourism==

There are many sandy beaches in the area of Donegal, such as Murvagh beach, and some boasting good surfing conditions, such as Rossnowlagh. Donegal is also used as a base for hill-walking in the nearby Blue Stack Mountains. The town has many hotels catering for visitors, and nearby towns such as Letterkenny offer public swimming pools, cinemas and large shopping centres.

Like most clothing manufacturers in Ireland, the size of the workforce has been in decline for many years. Some of the clothing manufacturers have survived by focusing on one particular item of clothing. For example, tailor David Hanna, who started making suits for the locals in 1924, switched to making only hats in 1964 and is now shipping them all over the world. Donegal also has a long tradition of weaving carpets. Donegal Carpets have been made in Killybegs for over one hundred years and have been found in Áras an Uachtaráin, the University of Notre Dame and the White House.

On 1 December 2016, &quot;National Geographic Traveller&quot; named Donegal as the number 1 coolest destination of 2017. According to Pat Riddell, editor of the UK magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone&#x27;s throw away. And it is wilderness . . . world-class wilderness. We think it&#x27;s due a big year.&quot;

==Transport==

The Bus Éireann service number 64 Derry/Galway route: this makes several other stops including Letterkenny and Sligo (which allows for rail connections by Iarnród Éireann, from Sligo Mac Diarmada railway station in Sligo to Dublin Connolly railway station). This route also allows for rail connections from Waterside Railway Station in Derry to Belfast Grand Central, via Coleraine. The number 30 Donegal Town/Dublin route which makes stops at other key towns such as Enniskillen (which provides connections to Belfast via Ulsterbus). The number 490 Glencolmcille/Donegal route which makes stops in Carrick, Kilcar, Killybegs and Mountcharles. The number 492 Dungloe/Donegal route connects Dungloe to Donegal, with stops in Glenties, Ardara and Killybegs.

The other public bus service, TFI Local Link, provides numerous routes for Donegal, including Route 292 to Ballyshannon, Route 293 to Glencolmcille and Route 994 to Portnoo. Route 264 from Ballyshannon to Letterkenny also has a stop in Donegal.

Bus Feda has also operates 2 services to Limerick via Letterkenny and Donegal, with stops in Sligo, Knock and Tuam. On Fridays during the college term it has a regular service to Limerick City, and on Sundays during term it also has stops at University of Limerick, TUS Limerick Moylish Campus and Mary Immaculate College.

Donegal railway station opened on 16 September 1889 and finally closed on 1 January 1960. The site of the old station is now used by CIÉ as a bus depot while the actual building is the home of the Donegal Railway Centre.

==Sport==
Donegal town is home to many amateur sports clubs. The most popular sport in the area is Gaelic football and the local GAA club is Four Masters. The club also has been developing hurling. Other popular sports include association football, rugby union, basketball and track and field.

==Media==
The town is home to the regional newspapers &quot;Donegal Democrat&quot; and &quot;Donegal Post&quot;, and previously the local &quot;Donegal Times&quot; newspaper. The &quot;Northwest Express&quot; regional newspaper is also distributed throughout the town and surrounding county, as is &quot;The Derry Journal&quot;. Ocean FM, an independent local radio station from Collooney in County Sligo, has one of its three studios in the town, which broadcasts to most of south County Donegal. Highland Radio, which is based in Letterkenny, can also be received in the town.

<text>The Taedong River () is a large river in North Korea. The river rises in the Rangrim Mountains of the country&#x27;s north where it then flows southwest into Korea Bay at Namp&#x27;o. In between, it runs through the country&#x27;s capital, Pyongyang. Along the river are landmarks such as the Juche Tower and Kim Il-sung Square.

The river is in length, and is generally deep. It is the fifth-longest river on the Korean peninsula and the second-longest in North Korea. Pyongyang is approximately 110 km upstream from the mouth, Sunchon 192 km upstream, and Taehŭng 414 km upstream. Because of its depth, it is widely used for river transport; it is navigable by large ships up to 65 km inland, although most commercial traffic stops at Songrim.

==History==
The kingdom of Koguryo was founded on its shores. Many archeological sites dating to the neolithic and Bronze Ages have been found along the river, as well as relics and ruins from Koguryo. It was also once known as the Pae River ().

==Dams and bridges==
In 1954, a bridge going over the Taedong River was partially destroyed during the Korean War. Despite the damage to the bridge, several hundred Koreans used it to cross the Taedong and flee south. Max Desfor&#x27;s photograph of the event, &quot;Flight of Refugees Across Wrecked Bridge in Korea&quot;, would win the 1951 Pulitzer Prize in Photography.

In 1986, the government completed the 8-km-long West Sea Barrage, with three locks and 36 sluices, at the mouth of the Taedong River near Namp&#x27;o. The dam acts to control floodwater and to irrigate lands newly reclaimed from the Korea Gulf. The dam prevents mixing of the outgoing river water with seawater, leading to an increase of contaminants concentration. Other dams, such as the Nyongwon Power Station, have been built to provide energy to the country.

In Pyongyang, there are six bridges on the Taedong, including the Okryu Bridge, Rungra Bridge, and Taedong Bridge.

<text>Dunfanaghy () is a small town, former fishing port, and commercial centre on the north coast of County Donegal, Ireland. It lies on Donegal&#x27;s North West coast, specifically the west side of Sheephaven Bay, on the N56 road (the West Donegal Coastal Route), 30 km north-west of Letterkenny.

==Description==
The centre of Dunfanaghy is a small square with a market house built in 1847 and a quay built in 1831 and formerly used to export corn. There are four churches: the early 17th-century Clondehorky Old Church (now ruined), constructed during the Plantation of Ulster; Dunfanaghy Presbyterian Church; Holy Cross Church (Catholic and known locally as &#x27;the Chapel&#x27;); and Holy Trinity Church of Ireland Church. The village is also home to a golf club, several art galleries and craft shops, and a museum, situated in part of a former workhouse, which describes the effects of the Great Famine on Dunfanaghy. Dunfanaghy is also home to St Michael&#x27;s GAA, a Gaelic football club.
==Local area==
Just outside the village is a three-mile-long sandy beach known as Killahoey Strand. On 16 June 1942, a RAF Ferry Command Hudson aircraft (42-66130) was forced to land on a beach near Dunfanaghy. (Irish Army archive reports call this &#x27;Hill Strand&#x27;.) It was feared the rising tides would swallow the plane, but 200 locals came out to pull it to safety. The aircraft was refuelled and the crew of four accommodated nearby overnight. They departed the next day to continue their delivery flight of the aircraft.

This event became confused with another aircraft landing in 1943 when, in the early 1990s, an American Harry X. Ford made an effort to find the town in which he crashed landed on 10 May 1943. Having visited the town in 1993 it was finally discovered he had not actually landed there but had been on a B-17 Flying Fortress which force landed on a beach at Bundoran on 10 May 1943. Irish Army Archive reports confirm Harry X Ford&#x27;s presence in Bundoran and not anywhere near Dunfanaghy or Portnablagh. Some sources published around 1993 attribute a landing on 2 May 1943 to have taken place on Killahoey Strand but this is an error confirmed by Irish Army Archives and the archives of the United States Air Force.

West of Dunfanaghy are New Lake and Tramore Strand, a two-mile-long beach. New Lake was formerly a salt water marsh, but during the First World War, over-cutting of the grass on the surrounding sand dunes led to their destabilisation and the movement of the sand to block up the river. As a result, the marsh filled with fresh water and became a lake. The sand also silted up Dunfanaghy harbour. The New Lake became a haven for seabirds and is now a Special Protection Area. Also nearby is Sessiagh Lough, a small lough with a crannog in the middle.

Across the bay from Dunfanaghy is Horn Head, which shelters Dunfanaghy from the Atlantic Ocean and is an Irish Natural Heritage Area.
Dunfanaghy is close to Portnablagh and Marble Hill, both of which also have popular beaches. Other sights in the vicinity include: Ards Forest Park, Ards (Capuchin) Friary, Glenveagh National Park, Doe Castle and the Derryveagh Mountains, the most prominent peaks being Muckish and Errigal.

===Workhouse===

As in many parts of Ireland in the mid nineteenth century, a Workhouse was constructed nearby for the detention and maintenance of destitute local people. The first occupants were admitted in June 1845, at the beginning of the Great Famine. Parts of the original building have recently been restored and now function as an interpretive centre of the Famine and its impact on the local inhabitants.

Near the workhouse, on the Falcarragh road, is the former Union fever hospital. Closed in 1922, it was reopened as a national school in the 1930s and fulfilled this role until the 1960s. Since 1968 it has been used as an artists studio and gallery.

==Transport==
Dunfanaghy Road was previously a stop on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway although the station was in fact six miles from Dunfanaghy itself. Dunfanaghy Road railway station opened on 9 March 1903, closed for passenger traffic on 3 June 1940 and finally closed altogether on 6 January 1947. Lough Swilly Buses served the area with four buses per day going from Dunfanaghy to Letterkenny and vice versa. Lough Swilly Buses also provided school transport to primary schools and the main secondary schools St Eunan&#x27;s College and Loreto Convent Secondary School, Letterkenny during school terms until April 2014 when the company ceased trading.

In 2018, Dunfanaghy is very well served by bus services to and from Letterkenny, the largest town in County Donegal. Buses are provided by Mangan Tours Buses, Gallagher Coaches, Feda O&#x27;Donnell Coaches and John McGinley Coaches.

<doc id="996518" wikidata="Q3246027" url="?curid=996518" title="General Assembly of Nova Scotia">
<text>The General Assembly of Nova Scotia is the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia. It consists of one or more sessions and comes to an end upon dissolution (or constitutionally by the effluxion of time — approximately five years) and an ensuing general election. Today, the unicameral legislature is made up of two elements: the lieutenant governor (representing the King of Canada) and a legislative assembly called the House of Assembly. The legislature was first established in 1758.

Like at the Canadian federal level, Nova Scotia uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are elected to the House of Assembly in general elections and the leader of the party with the confidence of the Assembly (normally the party with the most seats) becomes the premier of Nova Scotia and chooses the Executive Council from amongst the party&#x27;s members of the Assembly. Government is carried out in the name of the king, represented by the lieutenant governor, acting on the advice of the Executive Council (the Governor in Council).

The legislature was originally bicameral. From 1758 to 1838, it had an upper house called the Council, which also held executive functions. In 1838, the Council&#x27;s executive functions were given to an Executive Council, and the upper house was renamed the Legislative Council. That house was abolished in 1928.

<text>Emo () is a village in County Laois, Ireland. It is located near Portlaoise on the R422 regional road just off the M7 Dublin–Limerick motorway.

==History==
The late 18th century village of Emo originally developed around the gates of Emo Court. The village pub, the New Inn (now called the &quot;Gate House&quot;), dates from the village&#x27;s foundation, as does the Gothic Catholic Church, which contains the tomb of Aline, Lady Portarlington, with its recumbent effigy by Joseph Boehm. The site for the church was a gift from Lord Portarlington, and the parochial house and lands beside the church were granted by the Earl of Portarlington at a nominal rent.

Emo Court was designed in 1790 by architect James Gandon for the first Earl of Portarlington and is a well-known example of the neoclassical style.

There is a namesake town in Ontario named after this village by an Irish immigrant from the area.
==Sport==
Emo GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

==Oil==
The Emo Oil Company was historically based in Portlaoise and is named after the village. Owned by DCC plc, the company&#x27;s petrol stations were rebranded as &quot;Certa&quot; starting from September 2022.

<text>The Via Salaria was an ancient Roman road in Italy.
It eventually ran from Rome (from Porta Salaria of the Aurelian Walls) to &quot;Castrum Truentinum&quot; (Porto d&#x27;Ascoli) on the Adriatic coast, a distance of 242 km. The road also passed through Reate (Rieti) and Asculum (Ascoli Piceno).

Strada statale 4 Via Salaria (SS4) is the modern state highway that maintains the old road&#x27;s name and runs on the same path from Rome to the Adriatic Sea.

==History==
The Via Salaria owes its name to the Latin word for &quot;salt&quot;, since it was the route by which the Sabines living nearer the Tyrrhenian Sea came to fetch salt from the marshes at the mouth of the river Tiber, the Campus Salinarum (near Portus). Peoples nearer the Adriatic Sea used it to fetch it from production sites there. It was one of many ancient salt roads in Europe, and some historians, amongst whom Francesco Palmegiani, consider the Salaria and the trade in salt to have been the origin of the settlement of Rome. Some remains still exist of the mountain sections of the road.

== Roman bridges ==
There are the remains of several Roman bridges along the road, including the Ponte del Gran Caso, Ponte della Scutella, Ponte d&#x27;Arli, Ponte di Quintodecimo, Ponte Romano (Acquasanta), Ponte Salario and Ponte Sambuco.

<text>Tiberius Catius Asconius Silius Italicus (, c. 26 – c. 101 AD) was a Roman senator, orator and epic poet of the Silver Age of Latin literature. His only surviving work is the 17-book &quot;Punica&quot;, an epic poem about the Second Punic War and the longest surviving poem in Classical Latin at over 12,000 lines.

==Life==
===Sources, family and birthplace===

Silus was the son of a Greek father and a Roman mother; he acknowledges both of them in his writings. The sources for the life of Silius Italicus are primarily Letter 3.7 of Pliny the Younger, which is a description of the poet&#x27;s life written on the occasion of his suicide, some inscriptions, and several epigrams by the poet Martial. Silius is believed to have been born between AD 23 and 35, but his birthplace has not been securely identified. Italica, in the Roman province of Hispania, (modern Spain), was once considered the prime candidate, based on his cognomen Italicus, but, if that were the case, Latin usage would have demanded the form &quot;Italicensis&quot;, and it is highly improbable that Martial would have failed to name him among the literary celebrities of Spain in the latter half of the 1st century. The city of Patavium, Padua in northern Italy, has been suggested by J. D. Campbell based on a seeming bias in favor of the region in the &quot;Punica&quot; and the prevalence of the name Asconius in inscriptions from the region.

===Political career===
In early life Silius was a renowned forensic orator, later a safe and cautious politician. Silius was generally believed to have voluntarily and enthusiastically become an informer under Nero, prosecuting in court persons whom the emperor wished condemned. He was consul in the year of Nero&#x27;s death (AD 68), and afterward became a close friend and ally of the emperor Vitellius, whom he served, according to Pliny &quot;sapienter et comiter&quot;, wisely and amicably. He is mentioned by Tacitus as having been one of two witnesses who were present at the conferences between Vitellius and Flavius Sabinus, the elder brother of Vespasian, when the legions from the East were marching rapidly on the capital. Silius became proconsul of Asia AD 77-78 as attested in an inscription from Aphrodisias which describes his activities in maintaining the institutions of the city. According to Pliny (&quot;Ep&quot;. 3.7), he performed his duties well and earned himself a place of importance in the empire.

===Campanian retirement and suicide===
Despite his wealth and importance in the state, Silius eventually left politics in favor of a leisurely life; after his proconsulship in Asia he seems to have exercised little power and avoided offence. Thus, he outlived the Flavian dynasty without incident.

Pliny depicts him spending time in learned conversation at his villas, writing, passionately collecting books and sculpture, and giving recitations of his works. Silius was evidently writing poems as early as AD 88. It is firmly believed that the &quot;Punica&quot; was written during this retirement period of Silius&#x27; life. Martial 7.63 indicates that some of the &quot;Punica&quot; had been published by AD 92 and that Silius was no longer making speeches in court. His poem contains several passages relating to the Flavians, and Book 14 has been dated tentatively to after AD 96 based on the poet&#x27;s treatment of Domitian, who is eulogized both as a warrior and as a singer whose lyre is sweeter than that of Orpheus himself. The poet&#x27;s attitude to Domitian tends to be laudatory and friendly, employing the full spectrum of Virgilian panegyrical language and imagery. Certain passages towards the end of the poem can be read as referring either to Domitian or to his successor Nerva.

Silius was considered highly educated by contemporaries. The philosopher Epictetus judged him to be the most philosophic spirit among the Romans of his time, and Cornutus, the Stoic, rhetorician and grammarian, dedicated to Silius a commentary upon Virgil. He had two sons, one of whom, Severus, died young. The other, Decianus, went on to become consul. As he aged, he moved permanently to his villas in Campania, not even leaving to attend the accession ceremony of Trajan. Silius idealized and almost worshipped two great Romans of the past, Cicero and Virgil. He purchased Cicero&#x27;s estate at Tusculum and the tomb of Virgil in Naples, which he restored. Pliny records that Silius especially revered Virgil, celebrating Virgil&#x27;s birthday more lavishly than his own and treating the poet&#x27;s tomb as a shrine. His dual interests in composing epic poetry and discussing philosophical questions have been compared to the intellectual efforts of his heroes, Virgil and Cicero, respectively.

Silius was one of the numerous Romans of the early empire who had the courage of their opinions, and carried into perfect practice the theory of suicide developed in Stoicism; &quot;Punica&quot; 11.186-88 contains a praise of suicide. Stricken by an incurable tumour after the age of 75, he starved himself to death around 101 AD, keeping a cheerful countenance to the end. Pliny remarks that Silius was the last person to die who was consul under Nero.

==Works==
Whether Silius committed his philosophic dialogues and speeches to writing or not, we cannot say. His only preserved work is his epic poem entitled &quot;Punica&quot;, about the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) in seventeen books, comprising some twelve thousand lines, making it the longest preserved poem in Latin literature.

===The &quot;Punica&quot;===

The dating of the &quot;Punica&quot; has been a difficult issue for classical scholars, but two passages, 3.594 and 14.680ff., along with several poems of Martial cited above, indicate that it was composed sometime between 83 and 101, with Book 3 being dated to AD 84 and Book 14 around AD 96. Other books cannot be dated with any precision. The poem is divided into 17 books and is composed in dactylic hexameter. It has been thought that the poem was initially planned in hexads and that the original intent was to round off the composition in 18 books.

The poem takes Virgil as its primary stylistic and dramatic inspiration throughout; from its opening, the &quot;Punica&quot; is configured as the continuation of Juno&#x27;s grudge against Rome developed in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Livy and Ennius are important sources for historical and poetic information, and Homer specifically is declared an important model by Silius who remarks of him at 12.788-9, &quot;his [Homer&#x27;s] poetry embraced the earth, sea, stars, and shades and he rivalled the Muses in song and Phoebus in glory.&quot; Lucan is also an important model for the writing of historical epic, geographical excursus, and Stoic tone, although Silius&#x27; approach toward the gods is much more traditional.

The poem opens with a discussion of Juno&#x27;s wrath against Rome on account of Aeneas&#x27; treatment of Dido and of Hannibal&#x27;s character and upbringing. Hannibal attacks Saguntum and receives a Roman embassy. In Book 2, the Roman legation is heard at Carthage, but Hannibal takes the city after the defenders heroically commit suicide. The Carthaginians are catalogued, Hannibal crosses the Alps, and Jupiter reveals that the Punic War is a test of Roman manliness in Book 3. In 4 and 5 the Romans suffer defeat at Ticinus, Trebia, and Lake Trasimene. Book 6 looks back to the exploits of Marcus Atilius Regulus in the First Punic War, while Book 7 describes Fabius Verrucosus&#x27;s delaying strategy. Books 8-10 describe in vivid detail the battle of Cannae; Juno prevents Hannibal from marching on Rome. In Book 11, Hannibal&#x27;s army winters in Capua, where Venus enfeebles them with luxury. Hannibal is defeated at Nola in 12, emboldening the Romans. He makes an attempt on the city, but Juno stops him, revealing that the gods are against him. Book 13 reports the Romans&#x27; invasion of Capua and the death of two Scipios, which leads to Scipio Africanus&#x27; journey to the underworld (&quot;nekyia&quot;), his meeting with famous dead heroes, and a prophecy by the Sibyl of Hannibal&#x27;s defeat. In 14 the Marcellus&#x27; successful Sicilian campaign and the siege-craft of Archimedes are described. In 15, Scipio, choosing Virtue over Vice, has a successful campaign in Spain, while at the Battle of the Metaurus, Hannibal&#x27;s brother is killed. 16 describes the alliance between Rome and Masinissa and Scipio&#x27;s crossing into Africa, while 17 describes the bringing of the statue of Cybele to Rome, Hannibal&#x27;s stormy crossing into Africa, Juno&#x27;s appeal to Jupiter for the life of Hannibal, and the Battle of Zama. The poem ends with Scipio&#x27;s triumphal return to Rome.

Silius&#x27; style is unlike Virgil in that he does not focus on a few central characters but divides his action up between many significant heroes. This encourages him to present important events from the Roman past as a reflection on the characters and their actions in the poem&#x27;s present, echoing the Roman tradition of using &quot;exempla&quot;. While many important set pieces of epic are included, such as elaborated similes, &quot;ekphrases&quot; of objects, such as Hannibal&#x27;s shield in 2.391-456, a &quot;nekyia&quot;, and divine participation in and prophecy of events, there are also important elements of historiography such as paired contrasting speeches and detailed geographical description. Allegory is particularly important in Silius, and he includes such figures as Fides, faith, in Book 2, Italia in 15, and Virtus and Voluptas also in Book 15, continuing a trend towards allegory which was significant in Statius, Silius&#x27; contemporary. Silius&#x27; metrics and language can be closely compared to Virgilian usage, especially his use of spondees. Stoicism and stoic ethical thought are significant themes in the &quot;Punica&quot;. The war is configured as a trial of Roman &quot;virtus&quot; which must be overcome with hard work, akin to the Stoic ideal of overcoming adversity with inner courage and trial. The &quot;choice of Hercules&quot;, a favorite Stoic parable, is given to Scipio in Book 15, and everywhere the war brings out moral lessons and discussions of Stoic concepts like emotion, reason, and destiny.

==Influence==
The only ancient authors to refer to Silius are Martial, Pliny, and Sidonius Apollinaris. Pliny&#x27;s judgment that Silius wrote poetry &quot;maiore cura quam ingenio&quot; (with more eagerness than genius) has encouraged the view that Silius is a talented but mediocre and uninspired poet. The poem seems to have been mostly unknown in the Middle Ages. Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Africa&quot; was composed independently of the &quot;Punica&quot;, as the manuscript was discovered by Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 at the Abbey of Saint Gall during the Council of Constance. Julius Caesar Scaliger&#x27;s harsh opinion of Silius damaged his reputation. Many authors were familiar with Silius&#x27; work, such as Montaigne, Milton, Dryden (who considered him better than Lucan), Gibbon, and Alexander Pope. Joseph Addison particularly includes many quotations of Silius in his &quot;Dialogue on Medals&quot; as does Thomas Macaulay in his works.

Interest in Silius mostly vanished in the 19th century. As for visual arts, Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Vision of the Knight&quot; is a treatment of Silius&#x27; choice of Scipio.

<doc id="996535" wikidata="Q1114609" url="?curid=996535" title="Graiguenamanagh">
<text>Graiguenamanagh or Graignamanagh () is a town on the River Barrow in County Kilkenny, Ireland. Part of the settlement, known as Tinnahinch, is on the County Carlow side of the river, and Carlow County Council refers to the whole village as &quot;Graiguenamanagh-Tinnahinch&quot;. Also combined for census purposes, as of the 2022 census, Graiguenamanagh-Tinnahinch had a population of 1,506 people. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

Graiguenamanagh is located at the foot of Brandon Hill and is home to Duiske Abbey, the largest of the thirty-four mediaeval Cistercian abbeys in Ireland.

== History ==
===Ecclesiastical sites===
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area include an ecclesiastical enclosure and holy well sites in the townlands of Graiguenamanagh and Tinnahinch. St. Caelán reputedly founded a monastery at Tinnahinch during the 6th or 7th century.

Also located in the area are the ruined remains of the early Christian church of Ullard, founded by Saint Fiachra in the seventh century. Several miles downstream from Graiguenamanagh are the ruins of an ancient monastic establishment at St Mullin&#x27;s. 
=== Duiske Abbey ===

Based on an earlier settlement, much of Graiguenamanagh developed around the early 13th-century Duiske Abbey. The abbey, which takes its name from the river Duiske (Blackwater) which joins the Barrow here, was founded by William Marshall in 1204 and was suppressed by Henry VIII in 1536. Some remains of the monastery exist to the rear of the houses that line the east side of Lower Main Street.

The abbey&#x27;s large &quot;Early English&quot; gothic church was restored in the 1980s, and it is now the Catholic parish church in Graiguenamanagh. In its northern aisle is a model which shows the monastery as it was in the fourteenth century.

=== Economic development ===
The River Barrow, historically a transport route, was developed as a commercial navigation during the 18th century. Graiguenamanagh Bridge, a seven-arched limestone bridge spanning the River Barrow, was built in 1764.

Graiguenamanagh served as a base for commercial barges operating on the river until barge traffic ceased in 1959. These barges were later replaced by pleasure craft.

==Public transport==
The town is located on the R705 regional road. Kilbride Coaches operate a route linking it to Kilkenny via Gowran.

==Recreation and culture==

Watersports, angling, walking and cycling (including on the Barrow towpath) are common activities in the Graiguenamanagh area. The Barrow&#x27;s aquatic facilities include fishing, swimming, kayaking, and canoeing. The South Leinster Way, a long-distance trail, runs across the Barrow Valley and nearby Brandon Hill.

The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Graignamanagh GAA, fields teams in Gaelic football and hurling competitions and is based in Dr Tierney Park in the town. The town is also home to an athletics club and a soccer club.

There is a series of statues of monks in Graiguenamanagh, including several which depict the activities traditionally carried out by the Cistercian monks of Duiske Abbey. There is also a public library in the center of town. The Abbey Centre, beside the library, is home to an art gallery and a small museum.

<text>The Kalmar KVD440/441, also variously known as Tjorven or DAF Kalmar, is a delivery van based on the DAF 44, made in Sweden. The vehicle inherited the air-cooled, 844-cc boxer engine and Variomatic transmission from the DAF 44. The 440 was the postal version, while the 441 was intended for private buyers and had more comfortable front seats as its most notable revision. Kalmar also presented a pickup version (the &quot;Last&quot;, meaning &quot;cargo&quot; in Swedish) and five-seater passenger version called the Kombi in October 1969, but neither entered production.

In 1963 the then &quot;Postverket&quot; (Swedish Mail) needed a new vehicle for mail delivery, and contacted Kalmar Verkstad, who developed and built it between 1969 and 1972. On the export market it was simply called Kalmar. In addition to the heating provided by the air-cooled engine, to provide appropriate heating for postmen, some units were fitted with a gasoline-powered Eberspächer heater under the driver&#x27;s seat, with a dedicated exhaust pipe. The engine was not particularly durable and hurt the Tjorven&#x27;s reputation, while causing significant warranty claims on the company.

&quot;Tjorven&quot; was a nickname given to the Kalmar as its frumpy but sympathetic appearance was reminiscent of a contemporary Swedish television character of that name. The design was by Swedish industrial designer .

It was right-hand drive for easy driver access to road side letter boxes, and frame-built with a fiberglass bodywork.

Production ended in 1972 with about 2,000 built, most of them for mail delivery. The Swedish air force used 12 of them for support functions such as collecting the brake chute for J35 Draken and filling up the pilot&#x27;s oxygen. They were in use until 1976.

<text>Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson, (&quot;Christina Louise Helena&quot;; born 3 August 1943) is a member of the Swedish royal family. She is the fourth child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the youngest of the four older sisters of King Carl XVI Gustaf. She uses the name Christina Magnuson in a professional capacity.

==Early life==

Christina was born at Haga Palace outside Stockholm as the fourth child and youngest daughter of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She served as bridesmaid at the 1961 civil wedding of her sister Princess Birgitta to Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern as well as at the 1964 wedding of her cousin Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark to King Constantine II of Greece.

She was educated at Franska Skolan in Stockholm. Subsequently, she underwent studies at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts and as the only one of her siblings, she obtained a university degree in art history from Stockholm University.

==Public life==
Between her grandfather King Gustaf VI Adolf&#x27;s death in 1973 and her brother&#x27;s wedding to Silvia Sommerlath in 1976, Christina effectively served as Sweden&#x27;s first lady. As a result of this, she also maintained a public role within the royal family after her marriage in 1974, unlike her older sisters.
Christina chaired the Swedish Red Cross for nine years between 1993 and 2002. Through her friendship with Kjerstin Dellert, she has been chairman of the Ulriksdal Palace Theatre&#x27;s Friendship Society for several years.

Christina has co-authored several books – among them biographies about her grandmother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, and ancestress Josephine of Leuchtenberg.

In January 2023, the princess was seen and heard commenting extensively throughout a two-part documentary broadcast by Sweden&#x27;s national public service Sveriges Television about the &quot;last three kings of Sweden&quot;: her brother, grandfather and great-grandfather.

The princess has publicly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine calling it unacceptable and accusing Russia of committing war crimes.

==Marriage and children==
She met her future husband, business executive Tord Magnuson, at a lunch in Stockholm in 1961. Her engagement to Magnuson was announced on 1 February 1974. They were married on 15 June 1974 in the Palace Church of the Royal Palace of Stockholm.

The couple has three sons:

* Carl &quot;Gustaf&quot; Victor Magnuson (born on 8 August 1975), godfather of Prince Nicolas of Sweden. He married Vicky Elisabeth Andrén (born on 25 January 1983) in 2013 but were divorced in 2020. They have one daughter:
** &quot;Désirée&quot; Elfrida Christina Magnuson (born on 11 July 2014), a goddaughter of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden
* Tord &quot;Oscar&quot; Fredrik Magnuson (born on 20 June 1977), godfather of Prince Oscar of Sweden. He married Emelia &quot;Emma&quot; Charlotta Ledent (born on 18 April 1981) in 2011. They have two sons:
** Carl &quot;Albert&quot; Maurice Magnuson (born on 10 February 2013)
** &quot;Henry&quot; Guy Tord Magnuson (born on 16 October 2015)
* &quot;Victor&quot; Edmund Lennart Magnuson (born 10 September 1980), godfather of Prince Alexander of Sweden. He married Frida Louise Bergström (born on 18 February 1980) in 2017. They have two sons:
** &quot;Edmund&quot; Bengt Lennart Magnuson (born on 11 December 2012)
** &quot;Sigvard&quot; Hans Gösta Magnuson (born on 25 August 2015)

Christina is the godmother of her niece, Princess Madeleine, and Prince Joachim of Denmark, son of her first cousin, Queen Margrethe II.

==Health==
In October 2016, it was announced that Magnuson has been diagnosed with chronic leukemia. It was later made known that she had been cured following stem cell treatment.

<text>Julianstown () is a village in County Meath, Ireland. It is located near Drogheda on the R132 regional road. In 1641, the Battle of Julianstown was fought here during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

==History==
The parish of Julianstown is situated in the Barony of Lower Duleek and County Meath, and the parish is part of the Roman Catholic Union of Stamullen. Julianstown is significant in that it contains a bridge across the river Nanny on the road between Dublin and Belfast. One of the earliest mentions of Julianstown commemorates the Battle of Julianstown in 1641, which took place near the bridge. A plaque on the bridge, commemorating the battle, was erected on the bridge in the 1960s. Towards the south of the village is the smaller river Bradan (), which flows into the sea at Mosney.

Julianstown was the seat of the Moore family who lived in Julianstown House and occupied the land that now contains the townland of Julianstown West. Taylor and Skinner&#x27;s 1783 Road Map of Ireland refers to the Moore seat and also shows the Church of Ireland church which still stands today. There is little evidence of any other habitation at that time. Taylor and Skinner also show the milestone in the centre of the village marking 20 Irish miles to Dublin. There is further mention of William Moore in Lewis&#x27; &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (1837).

The Moores leased the land from Anglo-Irish landlords, including Anna Disney, the wife of Brabazon William Disney, Dean of Armagh. The land on which the present village sits was leased to Francis and Mary Thornburgh (née Moore) in 1763 by William Moore. In the lease the land was described as:

….. all that dwelling house offices orchard and garden thereunto adjoining known by the name of the Blackhorse Head Inn situate near Julianstown Bridge aforesaid together with the piece of parcel of ground opposite said house containing by common estimation 300 feet in length and 73 feet in depth more or less formerly known by the name of the Malt House bounded on the East by the Turnpike Road and on the North by the said William Moore&#x27;s ground adjoining the lands called the Corroge with two cabins or tenements standing thereon all of which lands and premises are situate in the Barony of Duleek and County of Meath.
The land was further subleased to Major Charles Pepper of nearby Ballygarth Castle in 1801. In 1856, Pepper made his lease perpetual under legislation of the time, with much of the village centre being built by the Pepper family. Around 1889 the cottages in the village, known as the Swiss Cottages, were built for the estate workers. The original public house in Julianstown was called the Black Horse Inn, and was mail coach inn, where the Lime Kiln pub and restaurant are now situated.

Milling was an important part of Julianstown&#x27;s heritage and history. In the 19th century, fourteen mills operated along the Nanny either flax or cornmills. The village became inhabited in the early 19th century and in 1869 a forge was established by Bartholomew Tiernan on land adjacent to the Nanny River. Some of his metalwork, commissioned for the cottages can still be seen to this day in Julianstown. In the past Julianstown had a dispensary, courthouse, telephone exchange, a shop, a quarry, a lime kiln and a Garda barracks.

==Local legends==
The history of east Meath and Julianstown, is very much interwoven with that of St Patrick who is reputed to have put a curse on the river Nanny, for which reason no salmon are found in the river. Tradition also has it that the saint made his first convert, who was named Benignus, now Benignus of Armagh, in Mosney Wood, using water from a nearby well to baptise him.

Located within the parish of Julianstown, about 3 kilometres outside of the village, near where the Nanny enters the sea, there is a bee-hive shaped tumulus on the north bank, locally known as Laogh&#x27;s Tomb.

==Education==
Julianstown has one primary school, Whitecross National School, founded in 1826 (). , a new &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; building was being constructed, with the 1980s extensions being demolished. As of 2021, these renovations had been completed and the renovated school was officially opened by Bishop Tom Deenihan on 18 November 2023.

==Demographics==
Julianstown/Whitecross was a census town in County Meath, comprising the adjoining villages of Julianstown and Whitecross. It had a population of 422 at the 2002 census. By 2011 this had grown to 616. For the 2016 census the census town name changed to only &quot;Julianstown&quot; (although the boundary still incorporated Whitecross), and its population to 681.

==Churches, crosses, and holy wells==
The Keenogue cross is an interesting portion of a 15th-century cross, whose original site is unknown. The shaft of the cross is carved on each of its four sides, framing at the bottom, the Crucifixion, Mary embracing the dead Christ, St Lawrence, and St James.

Whitecross is the name of the townland within Julianstown, where the school is located, and derives its name from what was most likely a termon or boundary cross. It has since been destroyed.

St Patrick&#x27;s Well is a small natural spring just east of the railway embankment, roughly 100 metres south of Mosney station. St Columcille&#x27;s Well is situated in Calliaghstown and is attributed the cure of warts and sores. There is a small statue surmounting the well, and it dates from the 14th century, and is carved from oolite stone brought from England.

<doc id="996545" wikidata="Q882119" url="?curid=996545" title="Kibbo Kift">
<text>The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift was a camping, hiking and handicraft group with ambitions to bring world peace. It was the first of three movements in England associated with the charismatic artist and writer John Hargrave (1894–1982). The Kindred was founded in 1920. Some members continued into Hargrave&#x27;s Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit, which was established in 1931–32, and which became in 1935 the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This was wound up in 1951.

Hargrave claimed all three organisations to be part of one mission, telling his followers after the last title-change: &#x27;We are the Green Shirts – indeed we are the Kindred – calling ourselves the Social Credit Party of Great Britain officially, but knowing full well who and what we are. &quot;Whelm on me ye Resurrected Men!&quot; – I give you that outcry of the Kin in 1927.&#x27;

The mission was the belief that Kibbo Kift training would produce a core of healthy and creative individuals through whom the human race would evolve into a society without war, poverty and wasted lives. The Kibbo Kift held that individual character strengthened by mental discipline was the key to the future, not mass movements based on groups defined by class, race or nation states.

==Origins==
The Kindred was formed at a meeting held on 18 August 1920 at the offices of the Charity Organisation Society. Besides Hargrave, the movers were Mrs Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, a former suffragette and Theosophist-inclined pacifist; and Dr C. K. Cullen, socialist-inclined medical officer in East London and a youth leader at the Camelot Youth Club in Poplar. All three shared a broad vision of creating a new model for character–building youth groups, a progressive, co-educational and non-militaristic alternative to The Boy Scouts Association. However, there were differences. In the early years of the Kibbo Kift, there were ideological and personal wranglings over the new organisation, from which Hargrave emerged in 1924 as the &#x27;Head Man&#x27;.

Hargrave (aka &#x27;White Fox&#x27;), artist, author and The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Commissioner for Woodcraft and Camping, had become disenchanted with the increasingly militaristic tendency in The Boy Scouts Association after World War I. Soon after the formation of the Kindred, Hargrave was expelled from The Boy Scouts Association by its chief, Robert Baden-Powell. According to Hargrave, Baden-Powell acted with extreme reluctance and only after some wealthy backers had threatened to withdraw funding from The Boy Scouts Association unless he was expelled.

The Kibbo Kift did indeed offer an alternative to The Boy Scouts Association: it was open to both sexes and all ages. The ideas of world peace and the regeneration of urban man through the open-air life replaced the nationalism and militarism Hargrave had detested in the post-World War I Boy Scouts Association. In its mixture of woodcraft, ritual and handicraft, it had much in common with the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry and the British Camp Fire Girls, which Hargrave knew through his wife, Ruth Clark, who led a Camp Fire Girls group at the Garden School run by the Theosophical Educational Trust in St John&#x27;s Wood. The school moved in 1920 to Ballinger Grange in Buckinghamshire where it became something of a Kibbo Kift centre.

== Beliefs ==
The words Kibbo Kift come from a Cheshire dialect term used to indicate &#x27;proof of great strength&#x27;, specifically lifting a heavy bag of grain (about 142 kg, or 325 lb) onto one&#x27;s shoulders. The group&#x27;s initials have led some to assume a relationship to the Ku Klux Klan but this has no basis in fact (and Hargrave took great pains to correct this misapprehension in the popular press during the group&#x27;s lifetime). Kibbo Kift had interests in regional geography and world culture that coexisted with passionate ideas about national identity. The group has been claimed to be &#x27;the only genuine English national movement of modern times&#x27;.

In 1920 Hargrave explained what the distinctive words meant:

:Kibbo Kift is an old English expression meaning literally proof of great strength – or The Strong. So today, in the woodcraft camp we speak of: 
:KIBBO KIFT – meaning the Idea and Ideal of the Great Outdoor Trail and Open Air Education
:THE KIBBO KIFT – meaning the Woodcraft Kindred, or the people who follow the great Woodcraft Trail
:TO BE KIBBO KIFT – meaning to be a good camper and woodcrafter, to be a clean, strong, upright man (woman or child).

The movement drew heavily on the woodcraft ideas of naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (also a key part of the early Scout Movement). Hargrave also imported into the movement his fondness for &#x27;symbology&#x27;, art and ritual – drawing his ideas on art from Jane Ellen Harrison, and on education from G.Stanley Hall&#x27;s then fashionable theory of &#x27;recapitulation&#x27;. Kibbo Kift was also strongly influenced by ideas about myth and religion from James Frazer&#x27;s popular anthropological study, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;.

In the second half of the 1920s the Kindred&#x27;s educational ideas tended to be swamped by Hargrave&#x27;s enthusiasm for the economic theory of Social Credit, but the faith in ritual and ceremony remained strong. According to Hargrave in 1924: &#x27;The Ceremonial System of the Kibbo Kift with all its Colour and Symbolism, has been, is, and must always remain vital to the expression of our ideals and to our method of propaganda. Other movements can go on with their everlasting, excessively dull and too often fruitless meetings, manifestos, reports and resolutions. They are not for us.&#x27; Inspiration for the more concealed of Kibbo Kift rituals came from a range of hermetic sources including the writings of Aleister Crowley.

==Activities==

Those who joined the Kibbo Kift had to sign up to a lengthy covenant, which set out some great Utopian ideals. In many aspects it resembled American President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s fourteen-point blueprint for world peace at the close of the Great War. The establishment of a League of Nations Union as well as H. G. Wells&#x27;s more far-reaching call for a World State were key touchstones for Kibbo Kift policies. A shorter, more personal, &#x27;Declaration&#x27; abbreviated the covenant and was used especially for younger members:
:I wish to be Kibbo Kift and to
:#Camp out and keep fit
:#Help others
:#Learn how to make things
:#Work for world peace and brotherhood

Kinsmen and women were organised into &#x27;Things&#x27; (districts), Clans (groups), Tribes (groups with children, such as scout patrols or classes from a school) and Lodges (groups of adults). There was also room for &#x27;Lone Kinsmen&#x27;, who kept up with the movement through newsletters: &quot;The Mark&quot; (1922–23), &quot;The Nomad&quot; (1923–25), and &quot;Broadsheet&quot; (1925–38). Each individual took a &#x27;woodcraft name&#x27;: thus Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence was &#x27;Lotosa&#x27; (Look to the Stars&#x27;). The correct costume had to be hand-made by each individual or &#x27;rooftree&#x27; (family group), according to designs laid down by Hargrave. The everyday &#x27;habit&#x27; of Saxon hood, jerkin, shorts and long cloak must have seemed outlandish in the English countryside of the early 1920s. The popular press also drew attention to the group&#x27;s skimpy exercise costumes; these included brassiere-type tops for women and gee-strings or breech-clouts for men. By the late 1920s the movement&#x27;s ceremonial occasions required brilliantly coloured surcoats or silk-embroidered robes, worn by the various office-holders such as the Tallykeeper, Campswarden, Ritesmaster and Gleeman. Hargrave himself was &#x27;Head Man&#x27;. Groups devised their own local activities, such as mumming plays, weekend camps, weekly meetings and excursions to museums. All groups came together for the annual Althings (assemblies), Spring hikes and Autumn Gleemotes (festivals). The Kibbo Kift&#x27;s central activities, hiking and camping, were elevated to the level of a spiritual exercise: all marked by colourful and impressive ritual, couched in language reminiscent of Norse Sagas and rich in Saxon archaisms. Hikes could be turned into &#x27;pilgrimages&#x27;, as for example in 1924 when the Kibbo Kift made a pilgrimage to Piltdown in Sussex, in homage to &#x27;Dawn Man&#x27;, a supposed early humanoid whose skull had recently been unearthed (later found to be a hoax). At the site the Kindred performed a ceremony, complete with fire rituals, psalm singing, ritual chanting and a plaster cast replica of the skull.

Kinsmen were not only required to make their own lightweight, one-man hiking tents (the first seen in England) but to decorate them with vivid, symbolic designs of their own devising. The movement included several talented art and craft teachers, including Kathleen Milnes (&#x27;Blue Falcon&#x27;), Winifred Tuckfield (&#x27;Iarmailteach&#x27;), a co-founder of the Knox Guild of Design and Crafts, and C.W. Paul Jones (&#x27;Old Mole&#x27;). Consequently, the robes, regalia, tents, totems and artefacts can display an extremely high standard of craftsmanship. Hargrave designed most of the movement&#x27;s official visual symbols, including the striking banners and the &#x27;sigils&#x27; (symbols) which were made into embroidered badges by Ruth Clark for the coloured surcoats of mandated officials. His designs for Kibbo Kift banners from the late 1920s are stronger and more graphic, probably a consequence of his work as a freelance advertising artist and copywriter, principally for Lever Brothers and Carlton Studios. The direct influence of commercial designers such as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Ashley Havinden is evident in Hargrave&#x27;s style.

== Members ==
The Kibbo Kift were never more than a few hundred strong at any one time but over a thousand members signed a covenant in total. Kinsmen and Kinswomen included former suffragettes Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Mary Neal and May Billinghurst, Evelyn Sharp (her husband, the journalist Henry Nevinson, was a passive supporter), the photographer Angus McBean, Ruth Clark, the mountaineer Mabel Barker (Patrick Geddes&#x27; god-daughter, through whom the Kindred became involved in Regional Survey work), the explorer Millican Dalton, Roland Berrill – later a founder of Mensa, and Rolf Gardiner – a folk-dance revivalist. Many teachers and art teachers were attracted by the movement&#x27;s educational aspirations. Kibbo-Kift friendly schools included Matlock Modern School in Derbyshire and the King Alfred School in North London. A major Kibbo Kift Educational Exhibition was held at Whitechapel Gallery in 1929.

The &#x27;Advisory Committee&#x27; named on the Kindred&#x27;s stationery did little more than lend their names to the organisation: they included Havelock Ellis, Maurice Maeterlinck, the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, H. G. Wells and Professor Julian Huxley. Patrick Geddes was the exception in taking a more active interest in the group. D. H. Lawrence followed the progress of the Kindred via the letters of Rolf Gardiner, and it has been suggested that Mellors in &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; is based on an archetypal Kinsman. T. E. Lawrence is also said to have allowed Kinsmen to camp on his land.

Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Rolf Gardiner tried to link the Kindred with European youth groups (arranging for Hargrave&#x27;s woodcraft books to be translated and published in Germany in the early 1920s). Although international Kibbo Kift groups appeared sporadically (the White Fang Tribe in Russia, for example) the only lasting European group was in Belgium, the Lawerce Lodge in Antwerp.

== Changes ==
The growth of the Kibbo Kift had setbacks. In 1924, the South London co-operative lodges seceded from the movement. This was the culmination of a growing dissatisfaction with Hargrave&#x27;s top-down decision-making structure and his tendency to make outlandish public claims for the organisation that deviated from the covenant and risked ridicule. in June 1924, a group of 32 signatories produced a circular leaflet stating &#x27;That the administration of Kibbo Kift during recent months has been profoundly unsatisfactory&#x27;. At the 1924 Althing, Dr. Cullen, Gordon Ellis, and Joseph Reeves from the Royal Arsenal Cooperative Society, which had supported the Kindred financially, led the formal walk out. One of the departing members, Leslie Paul, formed The Woodcraft Folk, which outlived its parent organisation and still exists .

In 1924, Hargrave was introduced to the theory of social credit. The theory was first put forward by C.H. Douglas, as early as the First World War. It was taken up by &quot;The New Age&quot; magazine which, under the radical leadership of A R Orage, enjoyed an influence out of proportion to its circulation. In the second half of the 1920s, Hargrave became progressively more preoccupied with social credit, seeing the Kindred as the megaphone, through which these esoteric ideas could reach the general public. By 1931, the Kibbo Kift was well on the way towards becoming a political movement with a single-minded mission: focussing on the state of the British nation and spreading social credit ideas among the unemployed (&#x27;surplus labour&#x27; in Hargrave&#x27;s terms) in Britain&#x27;s industrial cities. Again, the movement was split from top to bottom, but by 1932, the transformation was complete, and Kibbo Kift was no more. The Anglo-Saxon costume, camping, hiking and woodcraft were replaced by military uniform, marching and propagandising. The name was changed to the Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit, and later to the Social Credit Party of Great Britain.

As the Green Shirts, the Social Credit Party played a role in the political street culture of the 1930s: marching, meeting and often clashing with the Black Shirts and the Red Shirts. The Public Order Act 1936, which banned the wearing of uniforms by political groups, was a great setback for a movement that relied on agit-prop, but it was World War II that provided the deathblow. The organisation was wound up in 1951.

== Legacy ==
In 1976 &quot;The Kibbo Kift&quot; a rock musical, was put on at the Traverse Theatre for the Edinburgh Festival. The musical, created by Judge Smith and Maxwell Hutchinson, transferred to Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre, where, produced by Mel Smith, it played to great acclaim. This flurry of interest led to the formation of the Kibbo Kift Foundation, dedicated to preserving the documentary and material archive of the movement. The surviving artefacts, costume and regalia were lent to the National Trust Museum of Childhood at Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire, but in 1982 they were deposited with the Museum of London. The documentary archive went first to the University of Cardiff and then the British Library of Political and Economic Science. In 2015 over 300 items from the Museum of London&#x27;s collection were made accessible online through the museum&#x27;s website. The collection features strongly in &quot;Designing Utopia: John Hargrave and the Kibbo Kift&quot; by Cathy Ross and Oliver Bennett, published by the museum in 2015.

An exhibition, &quot;Intellectual Barbarians: The Kibbo Kift Kindred&quot;, exploring the group&#x27;s artistic output, ran at Whitechapel Gallery, London from October 2015 to March 2016, co-curated by Annebella Pollen and Nayia Yiakoumaki. The exhibition showcased original garments, sculptures, furniture, paintings, photographs and ephemera from public and private collections, and was accompanied by a series of public events. The exhibition coincided with the first full-length book to examine the organisation&#x27;s visual style and occult beliefs. Featuring over a hundred images, &quot;The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift: Intellectual Barbarians,&quot; written by Annebella Pollen, designed by Roland Brauchli, and published by Donlon Books, won a Most Beautiful Swiss Books award in 2015.

A new generation of creative practitioners have found inspiration in Kibbo Kift. Artists and designers including Olivia Plender, Steven Claydon and Liam Hodges, as well as novelists (Matthew De Abaitua, Kate Atkinson) and musicians (Ganser), have used Kibbo Kift ideas and imagery in their work.

<text>Strokestown (), also known as Bellanamullia and Bellanamully, is a small town in County Roscommon, Ireland. It is one of the 27 designated Heritage Towns in Ireland. Located in the part of the country marketed for tourism purposes as Ireland&#x27;s Hidden Heartlands, it is from Dublin and from Galway. Strokestown is one of Ireland&#x27;s few planned towns, showing evidence of deliberate planning, such as formally aligned streets and prominent public buildings. 
Features include the second-widest street in Ireland which measures 44.5 metres in width, and Strokestown Park House, an 18th-century mansion which is home to the National Famine Museum.

==Name==
&quot;Strokestown&quot; is a partial translation of the original Irish language name, Béal Atha na mBuillí, which meant &quot;the mouth of the ford of the strokes&quot;; &quot;mouth&quot; referred to the Bumlin River, running through the demesne. According to one theory, &quot;strokes&quot; referred to ancient clan battles that took place in the area; another theory has suggested that &quot;strokes&quot; signified the use of agricultural implements. Béal Atha na mBuillí was usually anglicised as Bellanamully and Bellanamullia.

The name &#x27;Bellanamullia&#x27; for Strokestown should not be confused with that of Bellanamullia, a village on the outskirts of Athlone.

The current, official Irish language name of Béal na mBuillí, which was adopted in the 1990s, originated as a version of the original name, reduced in length to fit on road signs.

==History==
===Development===
Strokestown was the site of the estate of the Mahon family, a prominent Anglo-Irish lineage, for over 300 years, from the late 17th century until 1981. As ground landlords, the Mahon family had overall control of the town planning. Founded in 1731 the Dublin Society provided guidance for landlords on a national-scale and it saw mass building and improvements of towns and villages in Ireland during this time, Evidence of landlord-sponsored improvements can be seen in Strokestown, as well as local quirks. The spatial transformation and growth was also influenced by other tenants that invested in the construction of individual buildings. During their sustained landlord patronage the Mahon family relied on these investors to achieve success in the urban project, as it allowed them to split costs while also ensuring a uniform appearance was achieved. The involvement of other tenants ultimately threatened the family&#x27;s direct input and saw a decrease in landlord influence by the second half of the 19th century.

The town was planned and laid out to centre on a broad avenue leading up to Strokestown Park House. The Mahon carried out regular building projects on the house during their sustained landlord patronage, which, alongside domestic servants, provided a steady source of employment for local people.

The diocesan census for Elphin carried out in the mid-eighteenth century showed the urban growth of Strokestown in comparison to rural neighbouring areas. The town was home to 592 people, living in 146 households, at this time.

===Famine years===
On 2 November 1847, Major Denis Mahon, a British Army officer who then held the estate, was assassinated by several local men, in an incident that became well known across Ireland and Britain. The killing was motivated by the eviction of tenant farmers during the Great Famine. However, the killing of Mahon did not halt the evictions; over 11,000 tenants were removed from the estate during the famine period.

The Great Famine is commemorated by the National Famine Museum in Strokestown. Mary Lenahan, of Elphin Street, Strokestown, an ancestor of former Irish President Mary McAleese, was among 16 people recorded in the Strokestown Estate Famine Archive as having received grain meal gratuitously on 23 June 1846. The archive was deposited in November 2008 in the Maynooth Archive and Research Centre in Celbridge, County Kildare.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Starting in 1948, a number of short film segments were shot in the area over a five-year period. These included film of sports days, Corpus Christi processions, weddings, agricultural shows, livestock fairs and FCA and fire brigade training. &quot;Strokestown on Film, The Billy Chapman (1902–59) Collection&quot; was later released as a DVD of 31 short films of people and events in and around Strokestown.

In the 20 years between the 1991 and 2011 census, the population of Strokestown increased from 568 to 814 people. As of 2016, the town had a population of 825.

==Transport==
Strokestown is located at the junction of the N5 National primary route and the R368 in the north of County Roscommon. Bus Éireann runs regular bus services to Westport and Dublin. The nearest railway stations are Roscommon (20 km), Carrick-on-Shannon (23 km), Longford (23 km), Boyle (29 km) and Castlerea (30 km). Ireland West Airport is west of Strokestown via the N5 road (Ireland). The road into the town from the entrance gate of Strokestown Park House is narrow.

==Architecture==
===Built heritage===

*Strokestown Park House The Palladian style Strokestown Park House, built c.1740, is met by a winding avenue that begins at a gothic-style entrance at the beginning of the demesne. The house was sold to the Westward Garage Group in 1979, and was subsequently restored. Its stable wing is home to Ireland&#x27;s first famine museum, opened in May 1994 by then President Mary Robinson. It is still used as a museum.
* Strokestown Park Gates A tripartite gate presents the Strokestown Park estate to the town laid out between 1810 and 1815 by Maurice Mahon. At almost one hundred and fifty feet wide, the main thoroughfare, leading up to the gates of the estate, was said to be the widest in Ireland at the time. The crow-stepped battlements belong to the &quot;picturesque&quot; style, in contrast to the restrained Classicism of the house.
* Church of the Immaculate Conception, Elphin Street - This Roman Catholic church was built between 1860 and 1863 on the site of an earlier structure, and was opened and blessed on 14 May 1863. It was built under the guidance of Fr Michael McDermott who was parish priest here from 1835 until his death. There is a plaque dedicated to him inside the church. The church was extensively modified in 1959/60. The church roof was lowered and two new bays were added to provide additional seating. The large scale renovation and extension of the church retained the altar, reredos and stained glass put in place by the original architect.
* St. John&#x27;s Church of Ireland, Church Street - This former Church of Ireland church was built in the 1820s, on the site of an earlier church dating from the eighteenth-century. The octagonal-shaped gothic church terminated function as a place of worship in the 1970s and is now home to the County Roscommon Heritage &amp; Genealogy Centre.
* St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, Carniska - The church was built in 1840/1841 and partly rebuilt and remodelled in 1909/1910 and in 1954/1955. Local stonemasons built the walls using stones quarried from nearby. Prior to this the place of worship for the area was celebrated in a barn situated on the site where the old and former Carniska School of 1841 existed. This barn was acquired and converted into a thatched chapel. Its roof was blown off during the hurricane of 1839 and the Rev. John Boyd decided to have a new church build.
* The Magnet Ballroom, Elphin Street - &quot;The Ballroom&quot; opened on Easter Sunday, 26 April 1936. The opening performance was from the Strokestown Dramatic Group. Dance bands performed here over the years, attracting couples from far and wide having been one of the few ballrooms in the vicinity. In 1950, a competition was held for a name for the hall, and after many entries &quot;The Magnet&quot; was chosen. The ballroom closed in the late 1970s. In 1989, it was bought by Walsh Mushrooms and was used as a mushroom farm until 2003.

===Derelict buildings===
As of 2021, a number of buildings on the main street in Strokestown lie vacant, representing (according to a 2021 &quot;Irish Times&quot; article) &quot;architectural evidence of Strokestown’s decline&quot;. The growing number of derelict buildings has had a significant impact on Strokestown&#x27;s streetscape. The town, which was once home to three department stores as well as three bank branches, is now home to none, with the last bank branch closing its doors in October 2021. The once &quot;bustling weekly market&quot; at the old Market House now houses just four stalls.

==Education==

Strokestown has two primary schools, St Mary&#x27;s Primary and St Patrick Boys&#x27; School, and one secondary school, Scoil Mhuire. There are also two other primary schools in the parish of Strokestown, Kiltrustan National School (5 km north of the town) and Clooncagh National School (7 km south). As of 2021, Scoil Mhuire secondary school had approximately 600 students, and offered transition year, Leaving Certificate Applied classes, and Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate state examinations. Strokestown Library is located in the town centre. Strokestown provides a community playschool and afterschool, offering care to kids between the age 2–12. Finally it provides a further education centre. The further education centre does not require any previous education. It provides training for modern offices, allowing candidates to seek education in this area.

==Places of interest==
Lisonuffy Graveyard is located 5 km southeast of Strokestown. The ruins of a 12th-century abbey are situated in the graveyard containing a pointed window and doorway. This was the site of a Christian settlement and was also in O&#x27;Connor Roe territory, descendants of an Irish noble house who were one of the most influential royal houses in Ireland. In 1734, a slab of marble sent from Italy was set into a wall of the Abbey ruins as a memorial to members of the O’Connor Roe family. The graveyard enclosing wall was built and complete by 1825.

Kiltrustan Cemetery is located 5.5 km north of Strokestown. The ruins of an 11th-century medieval church are situated in the cemetery. A wooden chapel was once erected in the cemetery grounds in 1805 by Rev. James Kelly. This was later replaced by the present church in Kiltrustan in the early 1850s. There are three vaults in the graveyard namely Donnellan, Shanley and McMahon. The grave slabs of two priests have been uncovered and the oldest headstone dates to 1717.

There are 14 lakes in the area, collectively known as the &#x27;Strokestown Lakes&#x27;.

==Sport==
Strokestown GAA is a Gaelic games club based in the town. It was founded in 1881 during a meeting in Duffy&#x27;s Hotel. A GAA pitch can be found at the top of Strokestown, surrounded by the local schools, the community centre and a soccer pitch. The club is seen as a successful club, recently winning the Roscommon County Senior Football Final in October 2022. Other local sports clubs include Kiltrustan Sports Club, which was established in 1979. In 2018 a new synthetic grass court was laid, and a walkway created around a newly reseeded pitch. Work was later commenced on lighting up the walkway.

Strokestown Golf Club is a 9-hole golf course located on the N5, approximately 2 km east of Strokestown. The club was formed in 1995 and in 2001 moved to its present location in Bumlin.

Community-based sports facilities and amenities include the Strokestown Community &amp; Sports Centre. This centre was built in 1980, and is used as a venue for indoor sports such as soccer, basketball, badminton, boxing and community games. The centre is also host to dancing championships, CCÉ Fleadhs, and other community events. The Strokestown Community Playground has been open since 2015 and is located on Boreen Road, off Church Street.

<doc id="996555" wikidata="Q1553789" url="?curid=996555" title="Mincemeat">
<text>Mincemeat is a mixture of chopped apples and dried fruit, distilled spirits or vinegar, spices, and optionally, meat and beef suet. Mincemeat is usually used as a pie or pastry filling. Traditional mincemeat recipes contain meat, notably beef or venison, as this was a way of preserving meat prior to modern preservation methods. Modern recipes often replace the suet with vegetable shortening or other oils (e.g., coconut oil) and/or omit the meat. However, many people continue to prepare and serve the traditional meat-based mincemeat for holidays.

==Etymology==
The &quot;mince&quot; in mincemeat comes from the Middle English &quot;mincen,&quot; and the Old French &quot;mincier&quot; both traceable to the Vulgar Latin &quot;minutiare&quot;, meaning &quot;chop finely&quot;. The word mincemeat is an adaptation of an earlier term &quot;minced meat,&quot; meaning finely chopped meat. Meat was also a term for food in general, not only animal flesh.

==Variants and history==
English recipes from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries describe a fermented mixture of meat and fruit used as a pie filling. These early recipes included vinegars and wines, but by the 18th century, distilled spirits, frequently brandy, were often substituted. The use of spices like clove, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon was common in late medieval and renaissance meat dishes. The increase of sweetness from added sugar made mincemeat less a savoury dinner course and helped to direct its use toward desserts.

===16th-century recipe===


Pyes of mutton or beif must be fyne mynced &amp; seasoned with pepper and salte and a lytel saffron to colour it / suet or marrow a good quantitie / a lytell vynegre / pruynes / great reasons / and dates / take the fattest of the broath of powdred beefe. And if you will have paest royall / take butter and yolkes of egges &amp; so to temper the floure to make the paest.

Pies of mutton or beef must be finely minced and seasoned with pepper and salt, and a little saffron to colour it. [Add] a good quantity of suet or marrow, a little vinegar, prunes, raisins and dates. [Put in] the fattest of the broth of salted beef. And, if you want Royal pastry, take butter and egg yolks and [combine them with] flour to make the paste.

In the mid- to late eighteenth century, mincemeat in Europe had become associated with old-fashioned, rural, or homely foods. Victorian England rehabilitated the preparation as a traditional Yuletide treat.

===19th-century recipe===
&quot;Ingredients&quot; — 2 lb. of raisins, 3 lb. currants, lb. of lean beef, 3 lb. of beef suet, 2 lb. of moist sugar, 2 oz. of citron, 2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, 2 oz. of candied orange-peel, 1 small nutmeg, 1 pottle of apples, the rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 1, pint of brandy.
&quot;Mode&quot; — Stone and cut the raisins once or twice across, but do not chop them; wash, dry, and pick the currants free from stalks and grit, and mince the beef and suet, taking care the latter is chopped very fine; slice the citron and candied peel, grate the nutmeg, and pare, core, and mince the apples; mince the lemon-peel, strain the juice, and when all the ingredients are thus prepared, mix them well together, adding the brandy when the other things are well blended; press the whole into a jar, carefully exclude the air, and the mincemeat will be ready for use in a fortnight.

===Apple mincemeat===
By the late 19th century, &quot;apple mincemeat&quot; was recommended as a &quot;hygienic&quot; alternative, using apples, suet, currants, brown sugar, raisins, allspice, orange juice, lemons, mace and apple cider, but no meat.

A recipe for apple mincemeat appears in a 1910 issue of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, made with apples, suet, currants, sugar, raisins, orange juice, lemons, spice and brandy.

There is also a similar recipe using green tomatoes instead of apples to create mincemeat in the 1970s book &quot;Putting Food By&quot;.

==20th century==

By the mid-twentieth century, most mincemeat recipes did not include meat, but might include animal fat in the form of suet or butter, or alternatively solid vegetable fats, making it vegan. Some recipes continue to include venison, minced beef sirloin or minced heart, along with dried fruit, spices, chopped apple, fresh citrus peel, Zante currants, candied fruits, citron, and brandy, rum, or other liquor. Mincemeat is aged to deepen flavours, with alcohol changing the overall texture of the mixture by breaking down the meat proteins. Preserved mincemeat may be stored for up to ten years.

Mincemeat can be produced at home. Commercial preparations, primarily without meat, packaged in jars, foil-lined boxes, or tins, are commonly available.

Mince pies and tarts are frequently consumed during the Christmas holiday season. In the northeast United States, mincemeat pies are also a traditional part of the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Like other pies, mince pies are sometimes served with cheese, notably cheddar.

<text>Rathkeale () is a town in west County Limerick, in Ireland. It is 30 km (18 mi) southwest of Limerick city on the N21 road to Tralee, County Kerry, and lies on the River Deel. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

It has a significant Irish Traveller population, and since 1995, almost half the town residents were members of the travelling community. Rathkeale also has the largest concentration of descendants of the German Palatines who immigrated to Ireland in the early 18th century.

Rathkeale has shopping facilities, a museum, two primary schools, and a community college (, founded in 1995). The town has a large Roman Catholic parish church, St. Mary&#x27;s, Augustinian Abbey ruins, and the Holy Trinity Church of Ireland church.

==History==

On the southwestern edge of the town is the 15th-century tower house of Castle Matrix. The castle was built as a fortress during the early 1400s by Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, and was later the home of Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond. It contains a display of art objects, holds historical records, and is one of a series of significant Desmond properties in County Limerick (see also Adare, Askeaton, and Newcastle West).

In the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Church are many gravestones bearing names of Irish Palatine families. These families came from Rheinland-Pfalz, in the Rhineland Palatinate, Germany as refugees in 1709. Many of their descendants now live in North America. The region around Rathkeale, namely the townlands of Killeheen, Ballingrane, and Courtmatrix, contains the largest concentration of Palatine descendants in Ireland today. Rathkeale&#x27;s former railway station on the closed North Kerry railway line from Limerick to Tralee has been converted into the Irish Palatine Museum.

==Transport==
Bus:
Rathkeale is served by Bus Eireann routes 13 and 14 which operate between Limerick and Tralee and Killarney respectively.

Railways:
Rathkeale railway station opened on 1 January 1867, closed for passenger traffic on 4 February 1963, and permanently closed on 2 December 1974. The Great Southern Trail, an off-road trail for cyclists and walkers, is a greenway rail trail which follows the route of the former Limerick-Tralee railway line between Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale.

==People==

*Sean (Jackie) Finn, Brigadier of the 4th (Rathkeale) West Limerick Battalion of the IRA during the Irish War of Independence was a native of Rathkeale. His grave in the local graveyard features an impressive Celtic cross.
*The town is reportedly home to many members of the Rathkeale Rovers crime group, who own much of the property within the town.

== Sport ==
* There is a large GAA training facility in Rathkeale called Mick Neville Park, which is owned by Limerick GAA and is used by the county teams for training and some matches. It also hosts a number of club games throughout the GAA season.
* Rathkeale A.F.C., who compete in the Limerick Desmond League Premier Division, and whose home ground is at Holy Cross, just outside the north side of the town. 
* Rathkeale GAA, who have both hurling and football teams, and whose home ground &quot;the bog garden&quot; is just outside the town on the north side.

<text>Paul Putner (born 18 March 1966) is an English actor and comedian.

==Life and career==
Putner was born in March 1966 in East Grinstead, West Sussex. He studied at LAMDA where he won the Kenneth More prize for comedy acting.

His first significant TV role saw Putner as numerous characters in &quot;The Glam Metal Detectives&quot; shown on BBC2. His real break in comedy came after he set up the club &quot;The Regency Rooms&quot; with fellow performers Steve Furst and Oliver Darly. The club developed a cult following and was attended by many comics. Richard Herring saw Paul performing there and cast him in his play &quot;Punk&#x27;s Not Dead&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe. This role led to many others including TV roles in Lee and Herring&#x27;s shows.

He has appeared in numerous British TV and radio shows, including &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot; (1998), &quot;Sir Bernard&#x27;s Stately Homes&quot; (1999), &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999), &quot;Rock Profile&quot; (2000), &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; (2004–2007), &quot;Look Around You&quot; (2004) and &quot;Little Britain&quot; (2003–2005). He appeared in a minor role as a zombie in the comedy movie &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; in 2004, and could also be heard on the zombies&#x27; &#x27;commentary&#x27; track on the DVD release. More recently he has appeared in the BBC Radio 4 science fiction comedy &quot;Nebulous&quot; (2005), &quot;Peacefully in their Sleeps&quot; on Radio 4 in 2007, &quot;The Peter Serafinowicz Show&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; in 2009 and 2014.

He has also contributed material to programmes including &quot;The Impressionable Jon Culshaw&quot;, &quot;Little Britain&quot;, &quot;The Peter Serafinowicz Show&quot; and is a co-creator of the website &quot;TV Dregs&quot;.

In 2005, Putner took the starring role (as a mime) in the 7th district section of the film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; written and directed by Sylvain Chomet. The film opened the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. From late 2005 until early 2007 Putner toured in the &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; show, and later appeared in Matt Lucas and David Walliams&#x27; TV follow-up, &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. In 2010 and 2011, Putner played the ill-fated Gerald &quot;Jelly&quot; Kelly in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; prequel trilogy, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, written by John Sullivan.

In 2013, he appeared in Kevin Eldon&#x27;s sketch show, &quot;It&#x27;s Kevin&quot; and an episode of the second series of &quot;Wizards vs Aliens&quot; as a troll called Mervyn.

Since then, Paul Putner has also appeared in many other TV/radio productions including: &quot;Kevin Eldon Will See You Now&quot;, Cabin Pressure, &quot;Up the Women&quot;, &quot;Pompidou&quot;, &quot;The Borgias&quot;, &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, &quot;Urban Myths&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Worlds of H. G. Wells&quot;, &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, and &quot;Miss Scarlet and The Duke&quot;.

<doc id="996575" wikidata="Q1741405" url="?curid=996575" title="Killybegs">
<text>Killybegs () is a town in County Donegal, Ireland. It is the largest fishing port in the country and on the island of Ireland. It is located on the south coast of the county, north of Donegal Bay, near Donegal Town. Its Irish name means &#x27;little cells&#x27;, a reference to early monastic settlements. The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward. In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional &quot;Blessing of the Boats&quot;. , the population was 1,258.

==History==

In 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel &quot;La Girona&quot;, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain&#x27;s war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the &quot;Girona&#x27;s&quot; personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.

In 1893 a railway station opened in the town, connecting it to Donegal town, but the line closed in 1960.

Bridge Street in the town centre was flooded during Storm Bert in November 2024.

==Fishing industry==

Killybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 metres at low water spring tide at the new €50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.

The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting. The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.
==Education==
The first national school, known as &#x27;Killybegs National School&#x27;, and later as the &#x27;Commons National School&#x27;, opened in 1834 on a site originally provided by the Plantation Commissioners in the reign of King James I
There are three national schools and one second-level school in Killybegs as well as a third level institution Tourism College Killybegs, the only dedicated tourism institute in Ireland, offering courses in hospitality, tourism and culinary skills. The college was academically integrated with Letterkenny Institute of Technology since 2001, and ATU Donegal since 2022.

St Catherine&#x27;s Vocational School is a non-denominational, co-educational second-level school. There are twenty-six teaching staff, five special needs assistants and three support staff. The student population is 385 and the male-to-female student ratio is approximately 50:50. The present two-storey building opened in 1987 provides facilities for students, teachers and members of the community. St Catherine&#x27;s has a range of extracurricular activities, the school has had success in English, Irish and science debates. The arts are well provided for with an art and music department, the music department has staged a number of musical productions, and students are taught a variety of instruments. Sport is also an important aspect of school life students participate in teams representing the school in soccer, Gaelic football, athletics, basketball and rugby.

==Transport==
===Road===
Killybegs is on the R263 road, joining the N26 road 3 km to the north.

===Bus===
The town is on several bus routes with many buses each day.

Local Link route 293, and Bus Éireann routes 490 and 492 operate to and from Donegal town and other local places. McGeehan Coaches operates a route 991 to/from Letterkenny and other local places.

===Rail===
There is no longer a rail service to Killybegs. A railway line opened on 18 October 1893 on the Donegal Railway Company (DR) line from Donegal town to Killybegs. The Donegal town to Killybegs branch of the DR terminated at the harbour and some of the remains can still be seen to this day. The railway was closed on 1 January 1960.

==Fintra Beach==
Fintra Beach (), a registered blue flag beach, is located on the outskirts of Killybegs town. It consists entirely of fine golden sand and receives large numbers of day-trippers during the peak of the tourist season. It is lifeguarded throughout the bathing season.

==Donegal Carpets==
Killybegs is famous for its tapestries and carpets, some of which were produced on the biggest carpet loom in the world at the &quot;Donegal Carpet Factory&quot;. The carpets, known as &quot;Donegals&quot;, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Áras an Uachtaráin and internationally the Vatican, The White House, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime &amp; Heritage Centre. The Centre provides information on carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot.

==Sport==
The local GAA club is Na Cealla Beaga. They play their home games at Eamon Byrne Memorial Park.

The local association football club, St Catherine&#x27;s, was founded in 1896. They play their home games at Emerald Park.

Killybegs Rowing Club can often be seen training in the harbour during the summer months and hold an annual regatta on the last weekend of July. The club row the Donegal Skiff, the traditional skiff of the county.

<text>John Burley Swainson (July 31, 1925 – May 13, 1994) was a Canadian-American politician and jurist who served as the 42nd governor of Michigan from 1961 to 1963.

== Early life and education ==
Swainson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He moved to Port Huron, Michigan, at the age of two, with his family.

His father, John A. C. Swainson, of Port Huron, was a Democratic presidential elector for Michigan in 1964 and an alternate Michigan delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

He was captain of his high school football team and an Eagle Scout.

Swainson served in the United States Army during World War II with C Company, 378th Infantry Regiment of the 95th Infantry Division and lost both legs by amputation following a landmine explosion November 15, 1944, near Metz, Alsace-Lorraine. He was awarded France&#x27;s &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot;, the Presidential Unit Citation with two battle stars, and the Purple Heart, all before his twentieth birthday. After months of convalescence and rehabilitation at the Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle Creek, Swainson learned to walk upright and unassisted.

Swainson received a B.A. from Olivet College, where he also met and married his wife, Alice Nielson. She accompanied him to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received a J.D. degree in 1951. While there, he was elected student president of the law school.

== Political career ==
Swainson was elected to the Michigan State Senate from the 18th District in 1954 and was reelected in 1956. In 1958, when Philip Hart was elected to the United States Senate, Swainson succeeded Hart as the lieutenant governor of Michigan under Governor G. Mennen Williams. When the long-serving and popular Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 1960, Swainson decided to enter the race. He did so despite being pressured by influential Democratic Party members, including Williams, not to run in deference to three-term Michigan Secretary of State, James M. Hare. Swainson won the primary against the party favorite, largely due to strong support from labor unions.

On November 8, 1960, Swainson narrowly (1.28% margin) defeated Republican Paul D. Bagwell, a Michigan State University professor, in the 1960 Michigan gubernatorial election. As a result, the 35-year-old Swainson became the youngest governor of Michigan in the 20th century. He was also the state&#x27;s second foreign-born governor.

Swainson&#x27;s lieutenant governor was T. John Lesinski. His opponent in the Democratic primary, Hare, continued to serve as Michigan Secretary of State until 1971.

During his two years in office, a tax was secured on the usage of telegraphs, telephones, and leased wires; court procedures and medical care for the elderly were improved, legislative pensions were excluded from both local and state taxes; and taxes on liquor, beer, and cigarettes were raised to fund educational programs.

When the Bluewater International Bridge (which spans the St. Clair River between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario) was paid off, Swainson used an executive order to cancel the $0.25 toll that had been collected. &quot;Stoically&quot;, he effectively cancelled his own father&#x27;s &quot;$6,115-a-year toll-collector&#x27;s job,&quot; which John A. C. Swainson held since 1957.

He appointed the first African American to sit on the Michigan Supreme Court.

In 1962, Swainson was defeated by Republican George W. Romney, the chairman of the American Motors Corporation, who had never before held elected office. The win was attributed in part to Romney&#x27;s appeal to independent voters, as well as to the increasing influence of suburban Detroit voters, who, by 1962, were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic city. (It also marks the only time in US history that a governor born in Canada was replaced by one born in Mexico.)

== Later years ==
On June 23, 1963, Swainson accompanied the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Detroit mayor Jerome Cavanagh, and approximately 125,000 people on a &quot;Walk for Freedom&quot; march down Detroit&#x27;s Woodward Avenue. The same year, he was also a member of Democratic National Committee from Michigan.

He served as Michigan Circuit Court judge of the 3rd Circuit from 1965 to 1971 and as a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1971 to 1975. In 1975, he was accused of accepting a $20,000 bribe from a felon, who was seeking review by the Supreme Court. He was found not guilty but was convicted of perjury over his testimony to the grand jury. As a result, he resigned from the Supreme Court, was sentenced to 60 days in a minimum-security facility, and lost his license to practice law for three years.

The criminal charges derailed his expected run to replace retiring senator Phil Hart. There are pundits who maintain that he was the &quot;victim of an overzealous prosecutor.&quot;

He later became an antiques dealer and became president of the Michigan Historical Commission. In the later years, he often represented the state at the Detroit Highland Games and apologized for not wearing a kilt: &quot;I don&#x27;t have the legs for it.&quot;

His life&#x27;s journey was described as being an inspirational story of personal redemption: &quot;By 1985, his reputation was restored when he was appointed president of the Michigan Historical Commission. (Michigan Supreme Court. Michigan Reports: Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of Michigan. Rochester, N.Y.: Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Co., 1949 - 1998, Vol. 419.)&quot;

==Death and legacy==
At the age of 68, Swainson died of a heart attack in Manchester, Michigan, and he is interred there at Oak Grove Cemetery. His wife, Alice, died on September 5, 2004, in Manchester at 77.

During his life, he was a member of American Legion, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Elks, Lions International, Delta Theta Phi, and Boy Scouts of America. In the Boy Scouts, Swainson was an active leader of the local Order of the Arrow lodge and served as secretary.

The Michigan Historical Commission established the Governor John B. Swainson Award in 1996 to honor him for his love of history and as one of the few public officials to have served in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state government. The commission presents the award to state, county, or municipal employees who have contributed to the preservation of Michigan history even if such activities are not part of their primary job responsibility. Swainson&#x27;s last public office was president of the Michigan Historical Commission as an appointee of Governor James Blanchard.

His papers are 75.1 ft, collected at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. Particularly represented are documents regarding research, public policy, and programs concerning poliomyelitis and the Salk vaccine.

Swainson was honored by an official portrait painted by Dorthea R. Stockbridge. The portrait was dedicated at a Special Session of the Michigan Supreme Court&#x27;s Special Session. The portrait hangs on the fourth floor of the Michigan Hall of Justice.

Hanging in the Michigan State Capitol on the second floor &#x27;Hall of Governors&#x27; is &quot;his gubernatorial portrait [that] is notable for appearing unfinished.&quot; It is said to be one of the most unusual portraits, a portent that Swainson&#x27;s political career was not yet finished. The Republican legislature even authorized the painting of a more traditional replacement, which has not yet been accomplished.

At the dedication of his judicial portrait, Swainson said he left the final judgement of his public career to history.

<doc id="996586" wikidata="Q4340903" url="?curid=996586" title="Thomas J. O'Connell">
<text>Thomas Joseph O&#x27;Connell (21 November 1882 – 22 June 1969) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Leader of the Labour Party from 1927 to 1932. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1922 to 1932. He was a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1938 to 1944, 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957.

==Background==
Thomas Joseph O&#x27;Connell was born near Knock, County Mayo, the second child of Maria Biesty and Thomas Connell. As part of the Gaelic revival, his family adopted the prefix &quot;O&quot; to their surname in the early 20th Century. His father was a farmer who was politically active and a community leader. Family lore held that his father had been a Fenian who had taken part in the Fenian Rising of 1867. He was also an activist in the Land League and a member of the United Irish League (UIL). One of Thomas&#x27;s aunts, Mary O&#x27;Connell, had been one of the first witnesses of the Marian Apparition at Knock in 1879. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this may have influenced the fact that Thomas was a devout Catholic throughout his life.

He qualified as a teacher in St Patrick&#x27;s training college, Drumcondra, Dublin. He taught at Horseleap, County Westmeath (1902–1905), then served as principal teacher at Streamstown, County Westmeath (1905–1916). In 1916 he became general secretary of the Irish National Teachers&#x27; Organisation (INTO), which post he would occupy until retirement in 1948.

In 1906 married Kathleen O&#x27;Connor, a fellow national school teacher. They had four children in the first five years of their marriage. A fifth child died shortly after birth. When Kathleen arranged for a substitute teacher to cover for her while she recovered from the loss of their child, she received a financial penalty from her employers for doing so. O&#x27;Connell was furious, and as a leading member of the INTO set upon a vigorous campaign to have the rule that prompted the fine removed. The campaign threw O&#x27;Connell into the national spotlight. O&#x27;Connell was able to use the old UIL connections of his father to contact John Dillon and other Irish MPs to raise the issue in the House of Commons, and eventually, the rule was dropped. The campaign was hailed as a great victory for the INTO and women teachers in Ireland.

==Political career==
At the 1922 general election, he was elected as Teachta Dála (TD) for Galway, and he was re-elected at the 1923 general election. O&#x27;Connell was able to utilise a strong grassroots organisation in the constituency as well as the vote of teachers to secure victory.

At the June 1927 election he stood instead in the new five-seat Mayo South constituency, where he topped the poll, and he was re-elected at the September 1927 election. In Mayo, O&#x27;Connell relied on the support of Teachers, migrant workers on Achill Island who were reckoned to better understand what a labour party stood for than other parts of Ireland, and the support of the area around his family&#x27;s homeland of South Mayo: Bekan, Knock and Ballyhaunis.

A critical blunder for O&#x27;Connell and the Labour Party occurred during the 5th Dáil. In August 1927, Fianna Fáil decided to enter the Dáil and it gave its support to the Labour Party&#x27;s motion of no confidence in the Cumann na nGaedheal government. The plan was to replace it with a Labour-National League Party coalition supported by Fianna Fáil, with Labour leader Thomas Johnson as President of the Executive Council. O&#x27;Connell was envisioned to be the new Minister for Education. The Cumann na nGaedheal government still had the backing of the Farmers&#x27; Party and most of the Independent TDs. When the vote was taken, John Jinks, a National League TD, failed to attend; another, Vincent Rice, crossed the floor to Cumann na nGaedheal. O&#x27;Connell himself was also missing, as he was away in Canada attending a conference on behalf of the INTO. The vote of no-confidence was a tie, and thus the Ceann Comhairle used his casting vote in favour the government. A rare chance in Irish history to place a labour led coalition in government was missed.

===Labour Party leader===
The 5th Dáil collapsed after just four months in office, resulting in the September 1927 Irish general election. The election did not go well for Labour, and they lost all the seats they had gained in the June 1927 Irish general election plus an additional one. One of the casualties was Johnson. The Labour Party&#x27;s statutes required the leader to be a sitting TD. As such, O&#x27;Connell was unanimously elected the new leader of the party, a position he would hold until 1932.

O&#x27;Connell inherited from Johnson a not particularly disciplined Labour Party. Johnson himself commented privately that between 13 TDs and 5 senators, no two of them could ever agree on the fundamental values of the party. Labour TDs not voting in line with the rest of the party was more common than with the other parties. In October 1931, the Cumann na Gaedhael government rushed to pass the Public Safety Act 1931. The act would allow the government to establish a military tribunal for hearing political cases as well as the right to suspend constitutional guarantees on their own discretion. It came in response to rising Irish Republican Army activity across the country but Labour and its members feared greatly it would trample civil liberties. An internal labour vote was held on the bill and by a margin of 3 to 1 they voted to oppose the bill. O&#x27;Connell denounced the bill in the Dáil, declaring it made a farce of the institution and that Cumann na Gaedhael might as well establish a military dictatorship in Ireland while they were at it. However, when the votes were cast on the bill, two Labour TDs, Deputy Labour leader Daniel Morrissey and Richard Anthony, broke ranks and voted with the government. Given the magnitude of such a fundamental vote, O&#x27;Connell felt he was forced to expel the two TDs from the party for their actions.

Another issue O&#x27;Connell dealt with during his tenure was in 1930 with the Letitia Dunbar-Harrison affair, perhaps better known as the &quot;Mayo Librarian Affair&quot;. Dunbar-Harrison had applied to become county librarian in Mayo, a position was that was vacant at the time. Ultimately the County Council refused to offer the position, on the stated reason she could not speak Irish but, as many felt, with the subtext being she was denied on account of being a Protestant. The issue ballooned and escalated into a national political issue with Cumann na Gaedhael supporting her appointment but the Catholic Bishops and many of the opposition parties opposing it. Perhaps surprisingly, the normally avowed non-sectarian Labour was amongst those opposing the appointment, with O&#x27;Connell working with the likes of the Archbishop of Tuam to advocate against it.

From 1929 to 1930 he was president of the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trades Union Congress. In 1935 he co-founded the Educational Building Society with Alexander McCabe.

==Later political life==
He lost his seat at the 1932 election, did not contest the 1933 general election, and in 1941 he was elected to 3rd Seanad. In 1943, he was elected to the 4th Seanad by the Cultural and Educational Panel, but did not contest the 1944 Seanad election. The Cultural and Educational Panel re-elected him in 1948 to the 6th Seanad and in 1954 to the 8th Seanad.

<text>This page lists the results of leadership elections within the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (known as the &quot;Conservative Party of Ontario&quot; before 1942).

Before 1920, leaders of the Conservative Party were usually chosen by caucus. In 1914, William Hearst was selected at a meeting of the province&#x27;s executive council (or cabinet) as James Whitney, the previous leader, had died while holding the office of Premier of Ontario.

All of the party&#x27;s leadership races before 1990 were determined by delegated conventions. The leadership races of 1990, 2002 and 2004 were determined by a weighted vote of all party members, with each constituency contributing an equal number of &quot;votes&quot; to the total. The 1990 race was decided in one round, while the 2002 race took two. For the 2004 election, the party introduced a preferential balloting system, such that party members would only be required to vote one time.

<text>William Wallace Barron (December 8, 1911 – November 12, 2002) was an American Democratic politician in West Virginia. He was the state&#x27;s 26th governor of West Virginia from 1961 to 1965.

==Life and career==
He was born in Elkins, West Virginia. He attended Washington and Lee University and the West Virginia University Law School. During World War II, he served in the United States Army. In 1949, he was elected mayor of Elkins. He became a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1950 and was re-elected in 1952. He resigned his seat when appointed as Liquor Control Commissioner by Governor William C. Marland subsequent to the 1952 election. He was nominated to Attorney General in 1956.

In 1960, he was elected governor of West Virginia and continued the clean government and civil rights reforms that had been instituted by his predecessor, Cecil H. Underwood.

He died on November 12, 2002, in Charlotte, North Carolina.

== Corruption trial and prison ==
On August 30, 1968, Barron was acquitted of federal charges concerning alleged money kickbacks and rigged state contract schemes in which he and several of his associates were involved. It was later realized that Barron and his wife, Opal Barron, had bribed the jury foreman. Barron was indicted, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison, albeit this was reduced to 12 years. He served four years of his sentence.

<text>Kilkee () is a coastal town in County Clare, Ireland. It is located in the parish of Kilkee &quot;(formerly Kilfearagh)&quot;. Kilkee is midway between Kilrush and Doonbeg on the N67 road and is a popular seaside resort. The horseshoe bay is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by the Duggerna Reef.

==History==

In the early 19th century, Kilkee was a small fishing village. Around the 1820s, a paddle steamer service from Limerick to Kilrush made Kilkee more accessible as a tourist destination, particularly for the Anglo-Irish aristocracy. Catty Fitzgerald opened the first hotel, which operated for 40 years. By the 1830s, two more hotels opened in Kilkee. Along with these, three churches were built, a Roman Catholic church in 1831, a Protestant church in 1843, and a Methodist church in 1900.

Descriptions of Kilkee during the Irish Famine can be found in John Manners’s travel narrative &quot;Notes of an Irish Tour, in 1846&quot; and Sydney Godolphin Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Gleanings in the West of Ireland&quot; published in 1850. These describe a provincial town primarily attractive for landscapes and sea-bathing. 

In the 1890s, Kilkee experienced a population boom when the West Clare Railway opened, which facilitated the transportation of goods and people. Many prominent people travelled to Kilkee during this time, including Sir Aubrey de Vere, Charlotte Brontë, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In 1896, the Crown Princess of Austria visited the town. The entertainer Percy French was a regular performer in the town and an incident on the West Clare Railway on the way to Kilkee prompted him to write the song &quot;Are Ye Right There Michael&quot;.

Kilkee has regularly been awarded the Blue Flag by the European Commission. In 2006, a statue of Richard Harris was unveiled in Kilkee by actor Russell Crowe.

=== Shipwrecks Around Kilkee ===
On 30 January 1836, the &quot;Intrinsic&quot;, a ship from Liverpool bound for New Orleans, was blown into a bay near Bishops Island in Kilkee. The ship was damaged against the cliffs and sank along with her crew of 14, of whom none survived. The shipwreck site is now called &#x27;Intrinsic Bay&#x27;. 

A chartered passenger sailing vessel named the &quot;Edmond&quot; sank at Edmond Point on 19 November 1850. The ship was sailing from Limerick to New York City but was driven into Kilkee Bay by a storm. Due to high tides, the ship was driven to Edmond Point, where it split in two. Of the 216 on board, 98 drowned in the disaster. 

Exactly 50 years to the day after the &quot;Intrinsic&quot; sank, on 30 January 1886, the &quot;Fulmar&quot; sank just north of Kilkee in an area known as Farrihy Bay. The ship was a cargo vessel transporting coal from Troon in Scotland to Limerick, but never reached its destination. Of the 17 crew members aboard only one body was ever recovered.

At some point between 28 and 29 December 1894, the &quot;Inishtrahull&quot; went missing somewhere near the Kilkee coast. At the time of the disappearance, the ship was transporting a consignment of coal from Glasgow to Limerick but never reached its intended destination. The ship was only confirmed to have sunk on 3 January 1985, when a section of a port bow from a ship with a brass plate marked &quot;Glasgow&quot; was picked up by the Kilkee coastguard. 

==Sport and recreation==
As well as bathing on the Strand, beachgoers can choose from the Pollock Holes, New Found Out, and Byrnes Cove. The Pollock Holes, also known as Duggerna Reef, are three natural rock-enclosed pools with water that change with every tide. This brings in fresh water and replenishes the marine life in the many rock pools surrounding it. The diving boards at New Found Out allow up to 13 meters (45 feet) into the open sea. The annual diving competition is held at these boards.

Every year, there are many participants in the Bay Swim, a race roughly a mile from the east end of the town to the west across the bay. The race starts at Byrnes Cove, a sheltered cove close to George&#x27;s Head, a prominent headland in the city. In 2011, nearly 200 people took part in the swim. There is also a mini Bay Swim for children under fourteen from Sandy Cove to the Pier.
The last weekend in June sees an influx of triathletes as Kilkee hosts the &#x27;Hell of the West Triathlon&#x27;, the longest-running triathlon in the country. This is one of the biggest and toughest triathlons on the Irish Triathlon calendar, with upwards of 600 athletes taking part in a 1500-metre swim, 45 km cycle, and finishing with a 10 km road race.

A version of racquetball (not squash, as is often incorrectly stated) has been played against the high sandstone walls in the West End for generations, and it is possible that the rules were codified in Kilkee before racquetball was standardized anywhere else. The main trophy, the Tivoli cup, was first competed for in Kilkee in 1935; racquetball in its current form was not codified internationally until 1950. Richard Harris, who would go on to become an internationally known actor, won the cup four years in a row, from 1948 to 1951, a record surpassed by no one to this day.

The Strand Races are horse races contested annually on the Kilkee strand. They first began in the 19th century on the sand hills where the golf club is now. The races are normally held over two days in September when the summer season is drawing to a close. The course is made by placing poles on the beach and when the tide goes out the races begin. Traditionally it was a celebration for farmers when the harvesting season was over.

A short-lived greyhound racing track was opened by the Kilkee Greyhound Racing Company on 2 July 1936. The land and assets of the track (behind the Olympia Hall and Merton Square) were put up for sale in 1942.

==Transport==
Before the West Clare Railway opened in 1887, the only way to get to the town was by paddle steamer from Limerick to Kilrush and then by horse and cart from there. This service ran from 1816 until 1918 but was stopped after World War I due to the popularity of the railway, although for many years the railway and steamer services ran together with a special &quot;Steamer Express&quot; train to and from Kilkee. After the railway closed in 1961, the only way to get to the resort was by car but as the mainline rail system now connects Limerick and Galway to Ennis, it is still possible to get the train as far as Ennis. Although the only bus routes offered by Bus Éireann from Kilkee are to Kilrush, Ennis, and Limerick (via Shannon Airport), it is possible to get to Cork or even Dublin through connecting buses or trains.

For international visitors, the closest airport is in Shannon.

<doc id="996597" wikidata="Q318254" url="?curid=996597" title="Poggio Bracciolini">
<text>Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (; 11 February 1380 – 30 October 1459), usually referred to simply as Poggio Bracciolini, was an Italian scholar and an early Renaissance humanist. He is noted for rediscovering and recovering many classical Latin manuscripts, mostly decaying and forgotten in German, Swiss, and French monastic libraries. His most celebrated finds are &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, the only surviving work by Lucretius, &quot;De architectura&quot; by Vitruvius, lost orations by Cicero such as &quot;Pro Sexto Roscio&quot;, Quintilian&#x27;s &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;, Statius&#x27; &quot;Silvae&quot;, Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27; &quot;Res Gestae&quot; (&quot;Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI&quot;), and Silius Italicus&#x27;s &quot;Punica&quot;, as well as works by several minor authors such as Frontinus&#x27; &quot;De aquaeductu&quot;, Nonius Marcellus, Probus, Flavius Caper, and Eutyches.

== Birth and education ==
Poggio di Guccio (the surname Bracciolini added during his career) was born near Arezzo, in Tuscany, in the village of Terranuova, which in 1862 was renamed Terranuova Bracciolini in his honor.

Taken by his father to Florence to pursue the studies for which he appeared so apt, he studied Latin under the amanuensis Giovanni Malpaghino of Ravenna, the friend and protégé of Petrarch. His distinguished abilities and his dexterity as a copyist of manuscripts brought him into early notice of the chief scholars of Florence; both Coluccio Salutati and Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli befriended him. He studied notarial law, and, at the age of twenty-one he was received into the Florentine notaries&#x27; guild, the &quot;Arte dei giudici e notai&quot;.

==Career and later life==
In October 1403, on high recommendations from Salutati and Leonardo Bruni (&quot;Leonardo Aretino&quot;), he entered the service of Cardinal Landolfo Maramaldo, Bishop of Bari, as his secretary, and a few months later he was invited to join the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs in the Roman Curia of Pope Boniface IX, thus embarking on 11 turbulent years during which he served under four successive popes (1404–1415), first as &quot;scriptor&quot; (writer of official documents), soon moving up to &quot;abbreviator&quot;, then &quot;scriptor penitentiarius&quot;, and &quot;scriptor apostolicus&quot;. Under Martin V he reached the top rank of his office, as &quot;Apostolicus Secretarius&quot;, papal secretary. As such he functioned as a personal attendant (&quot;amanuensis&quot;) of the Pope, writing letters at his behest and taking dictation, with no formal registration of the briefs, but merely preserving copies. He was esteemed for his excellent Latin, his extraordinarily beautiful book hand, and as occasional liaison with Florence, which involved him in legal and diplomatic work.

Throughout his long career of 50 years, Poggio served a total of seven popes: Boniface IX (1389–1404), Innocent VII (1404–1406), Gregory XII (1406–1415), Antipope John XXIII (1410–1415), Martin V (1417–1431), Eugenius IV (1431–1447), and Nicholas V (1447−1455). While he held his office in the &quot;Curia&quot; through that momentous period, which saw the Councils of Constance (1414–1418), in the train of Pope John XXIII, and of Basel (1431–1449), and the final restoration of the papacy under Nicholas V (1447), he was never attracted to the ecclesiastical life (and the lure of its potential riches). In spite of his meager salary in the Curia, he remained a layman to the end of his life.

The greater part of Poggio&#x27;s long life was spent in attendance to his duties in the Roman Curia at Rome and the other cities the pope was constrained to move his court. Although he spent most of his adult life in his papal service, he considered himself a Florentine working for the papacy. He actively kept his links to Florence and remained in constant communication with his learned and influential Florentine friends: Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli (1364–1437), Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici the elder (1395–1440), Leonardo Bruni (Chancellor, 1369–1444), Carlo Marsuppini (&quot;Carlo Aretino&quot;, Chancellor, 1399–1453), and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici (1389–1464).

===In England===
After Martin V was elected as the new pope in November 1417, Poggio, although not holding any office, accompanied his court to Mantua in late 1418, but, once there, decided to accept the invitation of Henry, Cardinal Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, to go to England. His five years spent in England, until returning to Rome in 1423, were the least productive and satisfactory of his life.

===In Florence===

Poggio resided in Florence during 1434−36 with Eugene IV. On the proceeds of a sale of a manuscript of Livy in 1434, he built himself a villa in the Valdarno, which he adorned with a collection of antique sculpture (notably a series of busts meant to represent thinkers and writers of antiquity), coins and inscriptions, works that were familiar to his friend Donatello.

In December 1435, at age 56, tired of the unstable character of his single life, Poggio left his long-term mistress and delegitimized the fourteen children he had had with her, scoured Florence for a wife, and married a girl of a noble Florentine family, not yet 18, Selvaggia dei Buondelmonti. In spite of the remonstrances and dire predictions of all his friends about the age discrepancy, the marriage was a happy one, producing five sons and a daughter. Poggio wrote a spate of long letters to justify his move, and composed one of his famous dialogues, &quot;An seni sit uxor ducenda&quot; (&quot;Whether an old man should marry&quot;, 1436).

Poggio also lived in Florence during the Council of Florence, from 1439 to 1442.

===Dispute with Valla===
In his quarrel against Lorenzo Valla—an expert at philological analysis of ancient texts with a hot temperament fitted to protracted disputation—Poggio found his match. Poggio started in February 1452 with a full-dress critique of the &quot;Elegantiae&quot;, Valla&#x27;s major work on Latin language and style, where he supported a critical use of Latin &quot;eruditio&quot; going beyond pure admiration and respectful &quot;imitatio&quot; of the classics.

At stake was the new approach of the &quot;humanae litterae&quot; (profane classical Greek and Latin literature) in relation to the &quot;divinae litterae&quot; (biblical exegesis of the Judeo-Christian &quot;sacred scriptures&quot;). Valla argued that biblical texts could be subjected to the same philological criticism as the great classics of antiquity. Poggio held that humanism and theology were separate fields of inquiry, and labeled Valla&#x27;s &quot;mordacitas&quot; (radical criticism) as &quot;dementia&quot;.

Poggio&#x27;s series of five &quot;Orationes in Laurentium Vallam&quot; (re-labeled &quot;Invectivae&quot; by Valla) were countered, line by line, by Valla&#x27;s &quot;Antidota in Pogium&quot; (1452−53). It is remarkable that eventually the belligerents acknowledged their talents, gained their mutual respect, and prompted by Filelfo, reconciled, and became good friends. William Shepherd, author of Poggio&#x27;s most extensive biography, finely comments on Valla&#x27;s advantage in the literary dispute: the power of irony and satire (making a sharp imprint on memory) versus the ploddingly heavy dissertation (that is quickly forgotten). These sportive polemics among the early Italian humanists were famous, and spawned a literary fashion in Europe which reverberated later, for instance, in Scaliger&#x27;s contentions with Scioppius and Milton&#x27;s with Salmasius.

Erasmus, in 1505, discovered Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s &quot;Adnotationes in Novum Testamentum&quot; (&quot;New Testament Notes&quot;), which encouraged him to pursue the textual criticism of the Holy Scriptures, free of all academic entanglements that might cramp or hinder his scholarly independence—contributing to Erasmus&#x27;s stature of leading Dutch Renaissance humanist. In his introduction, Erasmus declared his support of Valla&#x27;s thesis against the &quot;invidia&quot; of envious scholars such as Poggio, whom he unfairly described as &quot;a petty clerk so uneducated that even if he were not indecent he would still not be worth reading, and so indecent that he would deserve to be rejected by good men however learned he was.&quot; (Quoted in Salvatore I. Camporeale in his essay on the Poggio–Lorenzo dispute).

===Later years and death===
After the death in April 1453 of his intimate friend Carlo Aretino, who had been the Chancellor of the Florentine Republic, the choice of his replacement, mostly dictated by Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, fell upon Poggio. He resolved to retire from his service of 50 years in the Chancery of Rome, and returned to Florence to assume this new function. This coincided with the news of the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans.
Poggio&#x27;s declining days were spent in the discharge of his prestigious Florentine office—glamorous at first, but soon turned irksome—conducting his intense quarrel with Lorenzo Valla, editing his correspondence for publication, and in the composition of his history of Florence. He died in 1459 before he could put the final polish to his work, and was buried in the church of Santa Croce. A statue by Donatello and a portrait by Antonio del Pollaiuolo remain to commemorate a citizen who chiefly for his services to humanistic literature deserved the notice of posterity. During his life, Poggio kept acquiring properties around Florence and invested in the city enterprises with the Medici bank. At his death, his gross assets amounted to 8,500 florins, with only 137 families in Florence owning more capital. His wife, five sons and daughter all survived him.

== Search for manuscripts ==
After July 1415—Antipope John XXIII had been deposed by the Council of Constance and the Roman Pope Gregory XII had abdicated—the papal office remained vacant for two years, which gave Poggio some leisure time in 1416/17 for his pursuit of manuscript hunting. In the spring of 1416 (sometime between March and May), Poggio visited the baths at the German spa of Baden. In a long letter to Niccoli (p. 59−68) he reported his discovery of an &quot;Epicurean&quot; lifestyle—one year before finding Lucretius—where men and women bathe together, barely separated, in minimum clothing: &quot;I have related enough to give you an idea what a numerous school of Epicureans is established in Baden. I think this must be the place where the first man was created, which the Hebrews call the garden of pleasure. If pleasure can make a man happy, this place is certainly possessed of every requisite for the promotion of felicity.&quot; (p. 66)

Poggio was marked by the passion of his teachers for books and writing, inspired by the first generation of Italian humanists centered around Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374), who had revived interest in the forgotten masterpieces of Livy and Cicero, Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375) and Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406). Poggio joined the second generation of civic humanists forming around Salutati. Resolute in glorifying &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; (the study of &quot;humanities&quot;, a phrase popularized by Leonardo Bruni), learning (&quot;studium&quot;), literacy (&quot;eloquentia&quot;), and erudition (&quot;eruditio&quot;) as the chief concern of man, Poggio ridiculed the folly of popes and princes, who spent their time in wars and ecclesiastical disputes instead of reviving the lost learning of antiquity.

The literary passions of the learned Italians in the new Humanist Movement, which were to influence the future course of both Renaissance and Reformation, were epitomized in the activities and pursuits of this self-made man, who rose from the lowly position of scribe in the Roman Curia to the privileged role of apostolic secretary.

He became devoted to the revival of classical studies amid conflicts of popes and antipopes, cardinals and councils, in all of which he played an official part as first-row witness, chronicler and (often unsolicited) critic and adviser.

Thus, when his duties called him to the Council of Constance in 1414, he employed his forced leisure in exploring the libraries of Swiss and Swabian abbeys. His great manuscript finds date to this period, 1415−1417. The treasures he brought to light at Reichenau, Weingarten, and above all St. Gall, retrieved from the dust and abandon many lost masterpieces of Latin literature, and supplied scholars and students with the texts of authors whose works had hitherto been accessible only in fragmented or mutilated copies.

=== St. Gallen ===
In his epistles he described how he recovered Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Sexto Roscio&quot;, Quintilian, Statius&#x27; &quot;Silvae&quot;, part of Gaius Valerius Flaccus, and the commentaries of Asconius Pedianus at St. Gallen. He also recovered Silius Italicus&#x27;s &quot;Punica&quot;, Marcus Manilius&#x27;s &quot;Astronomica&quot;, and Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;De architectura&quot;. The manuscripts were then copied, and communicated to the learned. He carried on the same untiring research in many Western European countries.

=== Cluny Abbey ===
In 1415 at Cluny he found Cicero&#x27;s complete great forensic orations, previously only partially available.

=== Langres ===
At Langres in the summer of 1417 he discovered Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Oration for Caecina&quot; and nine other hitherto unknown orations of Cicero&#x27;s.

=== Monte Cassino ===
At Monte Cassino, in 1429, a manuscript of Frontinus&#x27; late first century &quot;De aquaeductu&quot; on the ancient aqueducts of Rome. He was also credited with having recovered Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27; &quot;Res Gestae&quot; (&quot;Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI&quot;), Nonius Marcellus, Probus, Flavius Caper and Eutyches.

=== Hersfeld Abbey ===
If a codex could not be obtained by fair means, he was not above using subterfuge, as when he bribed a monk to abstract a Livy and an Ammianus from the library of Hersfeld Abbey.

===&quot;De rerum natura&quot;===

Poggio&#x27;s most famous find was the discovery of the only surviving manuscript of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;) known at the time, in a German monastery (never named by Poggio, but probably Fulda), in January 1417. Poggio spotted the name, which he remembered as quoted by Cicero. This was a Latin poem of 7,400 lines, divided into six books, giving a full description of the world as viewed by the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (see Epicureanism).

The manuscript found by Poggio is not extant, but fortunately, he sent the copy to his friend Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli, who made a transcription in his renowned book hand (as Niccoli was the creator of italic script), which became the model for the more than fifty other copies circulating at the time. Poggio would later complain that Niccoli had not returned his original copy for 14 years. Later, two 9th-century manuscripts were discovered, the O (the Codex Oblongus, copied c. 825) and Q (the Codex Quadratus), now kept at Leiden University. The book was first printed in 1473.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning 2011 book &quot;The Swerve: How the World Became Modern&quot; by Stephen Greenblatt is a narrative of the discovery of the old Lucretius manuscript by Poggio. Greenblatt analyzes the poem&#x27;s subsequent impact on the development of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and modern science.

==Friends==

Poggio cultivated and maintained throughout his life close friendships with some of the most important learned men of the age: Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli (the inventor of the italic script), Leonardo Bruni (&quot;Leonardo Aretino&quot;), Lorenzo and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, Carlo Marsuppini (&quot;Carlo Aretino&quot;), Guarino Veronese, Ambrogio Traversari, Francesco Barbaro, Francesco Accolti, Feltrino Boiardo, Lionello d&#x27;Este (who became Marquis of Ferrara, 1441–1450), and many others, who all shared his passion for retrieving the manuscripts and art of the ancient Greco-Roman world. His early friendship with Tommaso da Sarzana stood Poggio in good stead when his learned friend was elected pope, under the name of Nicolas V (1447−1455), a proven protector of scholars and an active sponsor of learning, who founded the Vatican library in 1448 with 350 codices.

These learned men were adept at maintaining an extended network of personal relations among a circle of talented and energetic scholars in which constant communication was secured by an immense traffic of epistolary exchanges.

They were bent on creating a rebirth of intellectual life for Italy by means of a vital reconnection with the texts of antiquity. Their worldview was eminently characteristic of Italian humanism in the earlier Italian Renaissance, which eventually spread all over Western Europe and led to the full Renaissance and the Reformation, announcing the modern age.

==Legacy==
=== Works ===
Poggio, like Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (who became Pius II), was a great traveller, and wherever he went he brought enlightened powers of observation trained in liberal studies to bear upon the manners of the countries he visited. We owe to his pen curious remarks on English and Swiss customs, valuable notes on the remains of ancient monuments in Rome, and a singularly striking portrait of Jerome of Prague as he appeared before the judges who condemned him to the stake.

In literature he embraced the whole sphere of contemporary studies, and distinguished himself as an orator, a writer of rhetorical treatises, a panegyrist of the dead, a passionate impugner of the living, a sarcastic polemist, a translator from the Greek, an epistolographer and grave historian and a facetious compiler of &quot;fabliaux&quot; in Latin.

His cultural/social/moral essays covered a wide range of subjects concerning the interests and values of his time:
* &quot;De avaritia&quot; (&quot;On Greed&quot;, 1428−29) - Poggio&#x27;s first major work. The old school of biographers (Shepherd, Walser) and historians saw in it a traditional condemnation of avarice. Modern historians tend, on the contraryespecially if studying the economic growth of the Italian Trecento and Quattrocentoto read it as a precocious statement of early capitalism, at least in its Florentine form — breaking through the hold of medieval values that disguised the realities of interest and loans in commerce to proclaim the social utility of wealth. It is the voice of a new age linking wealth, personal worth, conspicuous expenditure, ownership of valuable goods and objects, and social status, a voice not recognized until the late 20th century.;
* &quot;An seni sit uxor ducenda&quot; (&quot;On Marriage in Old Age&quot;, 1436);
* &quot;De infelicitate principum&quot; (&quot;On the Unhappiness of Princes&quot;, 1440);
* &quot;De nobilitate&quot; (&quot;On Nobility&quot;, 1440): Poggio, a self-made man, defends true nobility as based on virtue rather than birth, an expression of the meritocracy favored by the rich bourgeoisie;
* &quot;De varietate fortunae&quot; (&quot;On the Vicissitudes of Fortune&quot;, 1447);
* &quot;Contra hypocritas&quot; (&quot;Against Hypocrisy&quot;, 1448);
* &quot;Historia disceptativa convivialis&quot; (Historical discussions between guests after a meal) in three parts (1450):
: 1) on expressions of thanks
: 2) on the dignity of medical versus legal profession (a reprise of Salutati&#x27;s 1398 treatment of the same subject, &quot;De Nobilitate Legum et Medicinae&quot;): Niccolo Niccoli, appealing to the lessons of experience, is arguing that laws are imposed by the will of the stronger to hold the state together − not God-given to rulers, nor a fact of nature − leading biographer Ernst Walser to conclude that &quot;Poggio, in his writing, presents Machiavellism before Machiavelli.&quot;
: 3) on literate Latin versus vernacular Latin in classical Rome; Poggio concludes that they were both the same language, not two distinct idioms.
* &quot;De miseria humanae conditionis&quot; (&quot;On the Misery of Human Life&quot;, 1455), reflections in his retirement in Florence inspired by the sack of Constantinople.

These compositions, all written in Latin − and reviving the classical form of dialogues, between himself and learned friends − belonged to a genre of socratic reflections which, since Petrarch set the fashion, was highly praised by Italian men of letters and made Poggio famous throughout Italy. They exemplify his conception of &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; as an epitome of human knowledge and wisdom reserved only to the most learned, and the key to what the ancient philosophers called &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;the good&quot;. And thus, they are invaluable windows into the knowledge and Weltanschauung of his age − geography, history, politics, morals, social aspects — and the emergence of the new values of the &quot;Humanist Movement&quot;. They are loaded with rich nuggets of fact embedded in subtle disquisitions, with insightful comments, brilliant illustrations, and a wide display of historical and contemporary references. Poggio was always inclined to make objective observations and clinical comparisons between various cultural mores, for instance ancient Roman practices versus modern ones, or Italians versus the English. He compared the eloquence of Jerome of Prague and his fortitude before death with ancient philosophers. The abstruse points of theology presented no interest to him, only the social impact of the Church did, mostly as an object of critique and ridicule. &quot;On the Vicissitudes of Fortune&quot; became famous for including in book IV an account of the 25-year voyage of the Venetian adventurer Niccolo de&#x27; Conti in Persia and India, which was translated into Portuguese on express command of the Portuguese King Emmanuel I. An Italian translation was made from the Portuguese.

Poggio&#x27;s &quot;Historia Florentina&quot; (&quot;History of Florence&quot;), is a history of the city from 1350 to 1455, written in avowed imitation of Livy and Sallust, and possibly Thucydides (available in Greek, but translated into Latin by Valla only in 1450–52) in its use of speeches to explain decisions. Poggio continued Leonardo Bruni&#x27;s &quot;History of the Florentine People&quot;, which closed in 1402, and is considered the first modern history book. Poggio limited his focus to external events, mostly wars, in which Florence was the &quot;defensor Tusciae&quot; and of Italian liberty. But Poggio also pragmatically defended Florence&#x27;s expansionist policies to insure the &quot;safety of the Florentine Republic&quot;, which became the key motive of its history, as a premonition of Machiavelli&#x27;s doctrine. Conceding to superior forces becomes an expression of reason and advising it a mark of wisdom. His intimate and vast experience of Italian affairs inculcated in him a strong sense of realism, echoing his views on laws expressed in his second &quot;Historia disceptativa convivialis (1450)&quot;. Poggio&#x27;s beautiful rhetorical prose turns his &quot;Historia Florentina&quot; into a vivid narrative, with a sweeping sense of movement, and a sharp portrayal of the main characters, but it also exemplifies the limitations of the newly emerging historical style, which, in the work of Leonardo Bruni, Carlo Marsuppini and Pietro Bembo, retained &quot;romantic&quot; aspects and did not reach yet the weight of objectivity later expected by the school of modern historians (especially since 1950).

His &quot;Liber Facetiarum&quot; (1438−1452), or &quot;Facetiae&quot;, a collection of humorous and indecent tales expressed in the purest Latin Poggio could command, are the works most enjoyed today: they are available in several English translations. This book is chiefly remarkable for its unsparing satires on the monastic orders and the secular clergy. &quot;The worst men in the world live in Rome, and worse than the others are the priests, and the worst of the priests they make cardinals, and the worst of all the cardinals is made pope.&quot; Poggio&#x27;s book became an internationally popular work in all countries of Western Europe, and has gone through multiple editions until modern times.

In addition Poggio&#x27;s works included his &quot;Epistolae&quot;, a collection of his letters, a most insightful witness of his remarkable age, in which he gave full play to his talent as chronicler of events, to his wide range or interests, and to his most acerbic critical sense.

===Revival of Latin and Greek===

In the way of many humanists of his time, Poggio rejected the vernacular Italian and always wrote only in Latin, and translated works from Greek into that language. His letters are full of learning, charm, detail, and amusing personal attack on his enemies and colleagues. It is also noticeable as illustrating the Latinizing tendency of an age which gave classic form to the lightest essays of the fancy.

Poggio was a fluent and copious writer in Latin, admired for his classical style inspired from Cicero, if not fully reaching the elegance of his model, but outstanding by the standards of his age. Italy was barely emerging from what Petrarch had termed the Dark Ages, while Poggio was facing the unique challenge of making &quot;those frequent allusions to the customs and transactions of his own times, which render his writings so interesting... at a period when the Latin language was just rescued from the grossest barbarism... the writings of Poggio are truly astonishing. Rising to a degree of elegance, to be sought for in vain in the rugged Latinity of Petrarca and Coluccio Salutati...&quot; His knowledge of the ancient authors was wide, his taste encompassed all genres, and his erudition was as good as the limited libraries of the time allowed, when books were extremely rare and extraordinarily expensive.

Good instruction in Greek was uncommon and hard to obtain in Italy. Proficient teachers, such as Ambrogio Traversari, were few and highly valued. Manuel Chrysoloras used to be occasionally credited as having instructed Poggio in Greek during his youth, but Shepherd cites a letter by Poggio to Niccolò Niccoli stating that he began the study of Greek in 1424, in Rome at age 44 (Shepherd, p. 6). Poggio&#x27;s preface to his dialogue &quot;On Avarice&quot; notes that his task was made the harder &quot;because I can neither translate from the Greek language for our benefit, nor are my abilities such that I should wish to discuss in public anything drawn from these writings&quot; Consequently, his knowledge of Greek never attained the quality of his Latin. His best-efforts translation of Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; into Latin cannot be praised for accuracy by modern standards. But he was the first critic to label it a &quot;political romance&quot;, instead of history. He also translated Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Ass&quot;, considered an influence of Apuleius&#x27;s Latin masterpiece, &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;.

===Invectives===
Among contemporaries he passed for one of the most formidable polemical or gladiatorial rhetoricians; and a considerable section of his extant works is occupied by a brilliant display of his sarcastic wit and his unlimited inventiveness in &quot;invectives&quot;. One of these, published on the strength of Poggio&#x27;s old friendship with the new pontiff, Nicolas V, the dialogue &quot;Against Hypocrites&quot;, was actuated by a vindictive hatred at the follies and vices of ecclesiastics. This was but another instance of his lifelong obstinate denouncing of the corruption of clerical life in the 15th century. Nicholas V then asked Poggio to deliver a philippic against Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, who claimed to be the Antipope Felix V — a ferocious attack with no compunction in pouring on the Duke fantastic accusations, unrestrained abuse and the most extreme anathemas.

&quot;Invectivae&quot; (&quot;Invectives&quot;) were a specialized literary genre used during the Italian Renaissance, tirades of exaggerated obloquy aimed at insulting and degrading an opponent beyond the bounds of any common decency. Poggio&#x27;s most famous &quot;Invectives&quot; were those he composed in his literary quarrels, such as with George of Trebizond, Bartolomeo Facio, and Antonio Beccadelli, the author of a scandalous &quot;Hermaphroditus&quot;, inspired by the unfettered eroticism of Catullus and Martial. All the resources of Poggio&#x27;s rich vocabulary of the most scurrilous Latin were employed to stain the character of his target; every imaginable crime was imputed to him, and the most outrageous accusations proffered, without any regard to plausibility. Poggio&#x27;s quarrels against Francesco Filelfo and also Niccolo Perotti pitted him against well-known scholars.

=== Humanist script ===

Poggio was famous for his beautiful and legible book hand. Berthold Louis Ullman identified him as the inventor of the type writing known as Humanist minuscule, which gave rise at the end of the fourteenth century to Roman type, which remains popular today.

Recent research by Teresa De Robertis and others has shown that other scribes had used Humanist minuscule before Poggio. So Poggio did not invent the new script, but he was one of the most prolific and distinguished scribes to use it so soon after its development, and his influence no doubt helped it spread through Italy.

<text>Kilrush () is a coastal town in County Clare, Ireland. It is also the name of a civil parish and an ecclesiastical parish in Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. It is located near the mouth of the River Shannon in the south-west of the county. Kilrush is one of the listed Heritage Towns of Ireland. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking community, until 1956.

==History==

Kilrush has existed since the 16th Century but an older church ruin at the local churchyard suggests a much older history. It is thought the name Cill Rois is derived from Church of the Wood, which would fit with the church ruins location.

Of Dutch origin, the Vandeleur family became the most prominent landlord family in West Clare. The Vandeleurs settled in the area, as tenants to the Earl of Thomond on land at Ballynote, Kilrush, in about 1656. Giles, the first Vandeleur in the area was the father of the Rev. John Vandeleur who was appointed prebend of Iniscathaigh in March 1687. He was buried at Kilrush in 1727. In 1749, John Vandeleur, son of the Rev. John, purchased lands in West Clare to the value of £9,826.0.6, from the fortune that had been acquired as one of the Commissioners for applotting quit rents in Ireland. It was not until the 18th century that the town underwent major development. This development coincided with the succession of John Ormsby Vandeleur as the wealthiest landlord in the district. He designed the layout of the town and many of the present-day street names derive from Vandeleur family names. John Ormsby Vandeleur also built the large family home, Kilrush House, in 1808.

John Ormsby Vandeleur owned much of Kilrush. With wealth achieved from a financially beneficial marriage and some political manoeuvring, he decided to develop the town. A Scots businessman James Paterson, who had been a gunboat lieutenant until 1802, assisted him in this project. Paterson entered the oats trade in west Clare and in 1802 he was given a site on the square from Vandeleur and erected a six-storey building. Buildings which Vandeleur commissioned included Kilrush Town Hall, completed in 1808.

The Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) led to an improvement in agricultural prices. As Kilrush and the neighbouring countryside began to prosper, Hely Dutton reported in 1808 that the town was &#x27;rising fast into some consequence&#x27;. He also acknowledged Paterson&#x27;s role as a &#x27;very active and intelligent inhabitant, who has been of the utmost benefit to Kilrush, and the adjoining counties&#x27;. In 1812 Paterson went into the shipping business and by 1817 he had a steamboat operating regularly between Limerick and Kilrush. The increasing popularity of Kilkee as a bathing resort brought many transit travellers to Kilrush.
In 1837 Samuel Lewis described Kilrush as a seaport, market and post town. The main industries, chiefly for home consumption, were flannels, stockings and bundle cloth. The main trade was corn, butter, pigs, agricultural products and hides. There were works for refining rock salt for domestic use, a tan-yard, a soap factory and a nail factory. Branches of the national and agricultural banks had been opened in the town and a constabulary police force was also stationed there. A small prison was built in 1825 and a courthouse in 1831.

However, the famine years (1845–1849) brought much hardship to Kilrush. Famine, evictions, fever and cholera reduced the population of south-west Clare to such an extent that it never again attained its pre-famine numbers. This was later vividly dramatised in a radio programme. In the late 1880s, the Vandeleur name became synonymous with the worst of landlord evictions. The Kilrush workhouse witnessed terrible deprivation and deaths. By that stage, Hector Vandeleur was the lord of the manor.

Kilrush commercially survived the setbacks of the Great Famine to a great extent as a result of the arrival of the West Clare Railway towards the end of the 19th century, developed into a bustling market town. There is a 1500-year-old monastic settlement at Scattery Island in the Shannon estuary which is about 15 minutes from Kilrush by boat. The settlement was founded by St. Senan. It features one of the oldest and tallest round towers in Ireland.

==Kilrush today==
The old port of Kilrush is now home to a 120 berth marina with automatic lock gate access to the Shannon Estuary, Scattery Island and the wild Atlantic Ocean. An impressive walled garden on the grounds of the old Vandeleur estate can still be visited today, though Kilrush House was gutted by fire in the late 19th century and finally demolished in the 1970s due to safety hazard. It stood where the main central car park now stands.

The nearby Moneypoint power station began construction in 1979 and was commissioned between 1985 and 1987. This brought a large economic boost to the town and wider region, with Moneypoint establishing itself as one of the primary employers in West Clare. However, due to a governmental climate change plan to cease burning coal in Moneypoint by 2025, electricity production has fallen massively, at times producing nothing. In 2019, it was announced that the workforce would be cut by more than half, raising fears for the economic health of the area.

The retail scene of Kilrush has changed massively in recent times, being almost unrecognizable to 2 decades previous. Large retailers such as Tesco (Opened 2008)) and Aldi (Opened 2009) have opened in the town, however a significant amount of smaller retailers have closed since the turn of the decade, almost decimating streets such as Moore Street.

Kilrush was the host venue for the 2013 National Famine Commemoration.

Offshore resides a large pod of Bottlenose dolphins who are resident year-round in the estuary. Dolphin-watching tour boats depart daily from the Kilrush marina, and the Shannon Dolphin and Wildlife Foundation has an information centre nearby.

Kilrush has been twinned with the town of Plouzané in Brittany, France since 1982.

In 2015, Kilrush won an Entente Florale gold medal, a European-wide horticultural and environmental competition. Kilrush represented Ireland in the &#x27;Village&#x27; category of the competition for population centres of less than 5,000 people.

==Sport==
===Current sport===
The town has an 18-hole golf course on the Ennis Road.
The Western Yacht Club has in the last decades been rejuvenated, being one of the oldest yacht clubs in the world.

Tennis, football (soccer) and athletics are catered for at the Cooraclare Road complex (under age and junior clubs). The rugby club is based on the Doonbeg Road.
Kilrush Shamrocks GAA Club is located on the Killimer Road. The ground, Captain Tubridy Memorial Park is traditionally called &quot;The Cricket Field&quot;, since it was used for that sport during the 19th century. The club was founded in 1886 and has recorded 21 county titles.
Kilrush is home to the West Clare Triathlon Club, a multi-discipline sports club, which trains and competes in the following sports – swimming, cycling and running.

Kilrush was the birthplace of a number of renowned sportspeople listed in the Notable People section below.

===Former Sport===
A short lived greyhound racing track operated from 1947 until 1950. A licence was granted on 1 October 1946 and the track opened on 31 May 1947, on the Cooraclare Road.

Kilrush has two primary schools and one secondary school. St. Senans NS is an English speaking school, the other is an Irish speaking Gaelscoil, which is called Gaelscoil Uí Choimin. The secondary school is called Kilrush Community School.

==Transport==
Kilrush is on the N67 (Galway – Tarbert) and N68 (Ennis – Kilrush). Kilrush is about 30 minutes drive from Ennis (40 km). Close by is a ferry between Killimer and Tarbert (County Kerry). The town is serviced by bus routes run by Bus Éireann and Clare Bus. The nearest airport is Shannon Airport.

Kilrush was once one of the twin termini of the West Clare Railway from Ennis, the neighbouring town of Kilkee being the other (see Irish railway history). The railway closed in 1961 but a short section of the railway has been re-opened at Moyasta as a tourist attraction. One of the original steam engines on the route, the Slieve Callan has been lovingly restored.

Kilrush Creek Marina is at the Atlantic Ocean end of the Shannon Estuary, with its lock gates providing protection from the tidal estuary.

<doc id="996600" wikidata="Q16839478" url="?curid=996600" title="Godolphin–Marlborough ministry">
<text>This is a list of the principal Ministers of the Crown of the Kingdom of England, and then of the Kingdom of Great Britain, from May 1702, at the beginning of the reign of Queen Anne. During this period, the leaders of the ministry were Lord Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough.

On 8 August 1710 Godolphin was dismissed and the Harley ministry took power.

==History==
Upon Queen Anne&#x27;s accession to the English throne in 1702, she appointed Lord Godolphin as Lord High Treasurer and the Duke of Marlborough as Master-General of the Ordnance (among other numerous appointments). They would lead this coalition of Tories and Whigs until 1708, one year after the Act of Union formed the Kingdom of Great Britain. There were three phases to the ministry. From 1702 to 1704 the ministry was largely Tory – Godolphin and Marlborough themselves were Tories, as were the Earl of Nottingham and Sir Charles Hedges, the Secretaries of State. After Nottingham&#x27;s resignation in 1704, Godolphin and Marlborough turned for support to the &quot;Country&quot; Whigs, led by Speaker Robert Harley. Not long after, the Whig complexion of the ministry grew, as Godolphin sought the support of Harley&#x27;s opponents, the &quot;second Whig Junto&quot;, bringing the Earl of Sunderland in to replace Hedges as Secretary of State in 1706, and other Junto allies like Sir William Cowper began to be appointed to positions of power. The leading ministers looked favourably on the Junto&#x27;s strong support for the War of the Spanish Succession. Harley at this point began to turn against the ministry and towards the opposition Tories, and his resignation in 1708 left the government largely in the hands of the Junto for its last two years, with Sunderland as Secretary of State, Lord Somers as Lord President of the Council, the Earl of Orford as First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Earl of Wharton as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The ministry finally collapsed in 1710 when Queen Anne turned to Harley and the Tories, dismissing Godolphin and the Junto Whigs, and, soon after, Marlborough himself.

<text>François Victor Masséna, 3rd [[Prince of Essling]] and 2nd Duke of Rivoli (born 2 April 1799 in Antibes, died 16 April 1863) was a French amateur ornithologist. He was the youngest of four children of Marshal André Masséna, Prince of Essling and Duke of Rivoli, and Anne Marie Rosalie Lamare. His siblings were Victoire Thècle Masséna, Marie Anne Elisabeth Masséna and Jacques Prosper Masséna.

Masséna accumulated a large bird collection of 12,500 specimens, which he sold to Dr. Thomas Bellerby Wilson in 1846. Wilson gave the collection to the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. Masséna described a number of new parrots with his nephew Charles de Souancé, including the green-cheeked parakeet. The slaty-tailed trogon, crimson-mantled woodpecker and Rivoli&#x27;s hummingbird were all named in his honor.

In 1823 he married Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli and they had four children. Anna&#x27;s hummingbird was named in her honor by fellow ornithologist René Primevère Lesson.

<text>Kilmallock () is a town in south County Limerick, Ireland, near the border with County Cork, 30 km south of Limerick city. There is a Dominican Priory in the town and King&#x27;s Castle (or King John&#x27;s Castle). The remains of medieval walls which encircled the settlement are still visible.

== History ==
===Foundation and development===
Saint Mocheallóg (literally &#x27;Mo - Ceallach - Og&#x27; meaning &#x27;my young Ceallach&#x27;) built a church in the area in the early 7th century, and the town&#x27;s name derives from the Irish &quot;Cill Mocheallóg&quot; meaning &quot;the church of Mocheallóg&quot;. This saint also established a hermitage or a small community of monks on Inisvickillane, one of the Blasket Islands off the coast of County Kerry. In St. Kieran&#x27;s College, Kilkenny, an ancient statue of Mocheallóg was venerated, depicting him as a bearded man with a monk’s cowl.

The town was of considerable importance in the late medieval period, ranking as one of the main urban areas in Ireland at the time. The Collegiate Church of St Peter and St Paul was built by 1241. Kilmallock was located in a position of some strategic importance, and in consequence the town frequently became a target during times of war.

In 1571, Kilmallock was sacked and burned by the forces of James FitzMaurice FitzGerald during the First Desmond Rebellion.
After being betrayed by the Rebel Earl of Desmond and captured after being secretly smuggled back to Ireland from France and put ashore at Corca Dhuibhne, Irish Catholic Martyrs Bishop Patrick O&#x27;Hely and Friar Conn O&#x27;Rourke were hanged under orders from Lord President of Munster Sir William Drury outside one of the gates in the walls of Kilmallock on 13 August 1579. Their bodies were allowed to remain suspended from the gallows for fourteen days. Both priests were beatified by Pope John Paul II in September 1992.

Seventy years later, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the Dominican Priory of Kilmallock was attacked and destroyed by a Parliamentary Army under Lord Inchiquin in 1648. Its ruins are the best known historic landmark of Kilmallock. The local cemetery is the burial place of the noted 18th-century Munster Irish poet Andrias Mac Craith. Better known as &quot;An Mangaire Súgach&quot;, his best known poem is &quot;Slán le Máigh&quot;, a Sean nos song in praise of the entire Maigue valley when he was temporarily exiled from it. The house where he died still stands at the bottom of Wolfe Tone Street near the River Loobagh. The house known as () (&quot;The Poet&#x27;s House&quot;) has information panels about the poet at the doorway. The town also has a small museum depicting the historic past of this once fortified Geraldine town.

===20th century===

During the Battle of Kilmallock, the town saw bitter fighting in July 1922 during the Irish Civil War, when it was held by anti-Treaty IRA forces under Liam Deasy and eventually taken by Irish Army troops under the command of General Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. This battle was one of a number of events which contributed to the dissolution of the short-lived Munster Republic.

As part of a brief sectarian campaign in July 1935, arsonists burnt the Church of Ireland building to the ground, causing damage costing thousands of pounds.

==Amenities==
Kilmallock is located in southern County Limerick, and provides economic and other amenities for the surrounding rural hinterland. The town was designated as a &quot;key service centre for South Limerick&quot; in Limerick City and County Council&#x27;s county development plan (2010–2016).

Services in the town include a number of primary and post-primary schools, a library and theatre, post office, a Garda station, veterinary practices, medical clinics, and retail and other businesses. Local community and development groups include the Kilmallock &amp; District Community Council, Kilmallock Tourism Development group, and Kilmallock Association for Trade and Commerce.

== Sports ==

The area is home to the Kilmallock Cycling Club, Kilmallock Athletic Club and also a centre for genetic horse breeding – with several stallion farms located in the district.

Members of the local Kilmallock GAA club have represented Limerick in the Munster hurling and All-Ireland hurling championships, and the club has won 12 senior county hurling titles.

==Transport==
===Road===
Kilmallock is at the junction of the R512 road (which runs from Limerick city to Fermoy) and the R515 road (which runs from Abbeyfeale, via Charleville, to Tipperary town).

===Rail===
Although the main Dublin–Cork railway line passes by the town, there is no longer a station: Kilmallock railway station closed in the 1970s, and the nearest one is now Charleville railway station, south-west of Kilmallock.

===Bus===
As of 2024 there are several Bus Éireann buses every day to/from Limerick city, and occasional Local Link buses to/from Charleville and other local places.

==Annalistic references==
From The Annals of the Four Masters:

* &quot;M1571.4. James Mac Maurice took Kilmallock, not from a desire of obtaining its riches and various treasures, though its riches were immense, but because it had always been the rendezvous and sally-port of the English and Geraldines in their contests against him. Before sunrise in the morning those who had gone to sleep happily and comfortably were aroused from their slumber by a furious attack made by the warlike troops of the Clann-Sweeny and Clann-Sheehy, who were along with James Mac Maurice; and they proceeded to divide among themselves its gold, silver, various riches, and valuable jewels, which the father would not have acknowledged to his heir, or the mother to her daughter, on the day before. They were engaged for the space of three days and nights in carrying away the several kinds of riches and precious goods, as cups and ornamented goblets, upon their horses and steeds, to the woods and forests of Etharlach, and sending others of them privately to their friends and companions. They then set fire to the town, and raised a dense, heavy cloud, and a black, thick, and gloomy shroud of smoke about it, after they had torn down and demolished its houses of stone and wood; so that Kilmallock became the receptacle and abode of wolves, in addition to all the other misfortunes up to that time.&quot;

<text>Manorhamilton () is the second-largest town in County Leitrim, Ireland. It is located on the N16 from Sligo and from Enniskillen.

== History ==
Before the Plantations of Ireland, the settlement was known, and continues to be known in the Irish language, as &quot;Cluainín&quot; or &quot;Cluainín Uí Ruairc&quot; (meaning &quot;little meadow of O&#x27;Rourke&quot;). This lay on the west bank of the Owenbeg. Uí Ruairc (anglicised as O&#x27;Rourke) was the local Gaelic chieftain, based in nearby Dromahair, whose land was seized by the English and then granted to Sir Frederick Hamilton for his services in the European wars of the 17th century. As a result of his actions, Hamilton to this day is considered to have been a tyrant by the local people. He began building a new town on the east bank of the river, in the townland of Clonmullen, which he renamed &#x27;Manorhamilton&#x27;. After the town emerged, the name &quot;Baile Hamaltuin&quot; was adopted by Irish speakers and its anglicised form &#x27;Ballyhamilton&#x27; was for a time used by English speakers.

;Manorhamilton Castle
Manorhamilton castle was erected in 1634 by Sir Frederick Hamilton, who had been granted land in north Leitrim by the British government. The land had been confiscated from the O&#x27;Rourkes, the ruling clan of Breifne. Hamilton was a very unpopular overlord and faced frequent native rebellion before the Castle was burned by the Earls of Clanrickard (Burkes) in 1652. The castle ruin has been renovated as a tourist attraction.

== Economy and culture==

Manorhamilton acts as a retail and services catchment for the surrounding rural area. Manorhamilton is also home to several manufacturing businesses, including manufacturers of rubber, plastics, automotive and other products.

Throughout at least the 19th and 20th centuries, a number of annual fairs were held at Manorhamilton on 8 May, 1 July, 7 October and 18 November, with four annual fairs held at nearby Lurganboy on 15 (or 17) May, 21 June, 21 August, 23 September and 21 October.

Farming is still a dominant sector, yet traditional industries and livelihoods are being replaced by new forms of economic activity.

Manorhamilton has several pubs, with many hosting traditional Irish music sessions.
== Places of interest ==
=== Manorhamilton Castle &amp; Heritage Centre ===

The ruins of Manorhamilton Castle have been renovated and now house a heritage centre and a permanent exhibition, with guided tours of the castle ruins and grounds.

=== Bee Park Resource Centre ===
The Bee Park Resource Centre is a facility on the site of the former community centre. The centre has a large main hall which stages concerts and community events. The Bee Park Centre is also used by youth, sport, disability and childcare groups. The North Leitrim Women&#x27;s Group and The North Leitrim Men&#x27;s Group are also located here.

=== Square ===
A public square has been developed adjacent to Manorhamilton Castle on the former fair green. The square, which incorporates an outdoor performance platform, features an abstract sculpture, sourced from the local Leitrim Sculpture Centre.

=== Famine graveyard ===
This plot is one of three graveyards opened shortly before and during the Great Famine of 1845 - 1849.

=== Megalithic sites ===
The north Leitrim area features a number of pre-historic sites of interest. This includes the nearby O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Rock plateau, where several well-preserved stone forts and passage tombs are located. Cairns and other tombs are also visible on Benbo Mountain and at the summits of surrounding mountains. On lower ground, the remains of ringforts and cashels, tombs and other structures are dotted throughout the landscape.

Manorhamilton previously had its own station, Manorhamilton railway station, which opened in 1880 and formed part of the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SLNCR). All maintenance on the line&#x27;s engines and rolling stock was carried out at the station works, and the railway became a major employer locally. The administrative headquarters of the SLNCR was located in the nearby village of Lurganboy. The railway served as a major business and tourism artery to the area and developed a large trade in livestock exports. The SLNCR, and with it Manorhamilton station, closed on 1 October 1957.

<doc id="996611" wikidata="Q730505" url="?curid=996611" title="Niccolò de' Niccoli">
<text>Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli (1364 – 22 January 1437) was an Italian Renaissance humanist.

He was born and died in Florence, Italy, and was one of the chief figures in the company of learned men which gathered around the patronage of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. Niccoli&#x27;s chief services to classical literature consisted in his work as a copyist and collator of ancient manuscripts; he corrected the text, introduced divisions into chapters, and made tables of contents.

== Achievements ==
His lack of critical faculty was compensated by his excellent taste; in Greek (of which he knew very little) he had the assistance of Ambrogio Traversari. Many of the most valuable manuscripts in the Laurentian Library are by his hand, amongst them those of Lucretius and of twelve comedies of Plautus. The pursuit of ancient manuscripts was a dangerous and expensive task; agents working in the field at the time included Poggio Bracciolini. Thanks to the patronage of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, Niccoli was able to build up his personal library of 800 manuscripts. He was generous with lending out his books since he had multiple copies of several Classical texts. This would be the basis of the library that Cosimo de&#x27; Medici built in San Marco.

Niccoli&#x27;s private library was bettered only by that of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici who was the pioneer of the first Florentine public library which was the largest in Europe at that time. Niccoli also possessed a small but valuable collection of ancient works of art, coins and medals. He regarded himself as an infallible critic, and could not bear the slightest contradiction; his quarrels with Francesco Filelfo, Guarino da Verona and especially with Traversari created a great sensation in the learned world at the time.

His hypercritical spirit (according to his enemies, his ignorance of the language) prevented him from writing or speaking in Latin; his sole literary work was a short tract in Italian on &quot;Latin Orthography&quot;, which he withdrew from circulation after it had been violently attacked by Guarino. His fame as a Latin stylist was extensive, and many authors would submit to him their manuscripts prior to publication for correction; Leonardo Bruni called him the &quot;censor of the Latin tongue&quot;.

He is also regarded as the inventor of the cursive script, known today as Italic or Cancelleresca. This came about from his enduring study of ancient manuscripts and the numerous copies he made. Niccoli decided he would vary his copied manuscripts by using tilted lettering and as a result later on, when Italian printers first used Italic type, they chose Niccoli&#x27;s lettering style.

Niccoli was buried in the Basilica of Santo Spirito in Florence. He was extremely indebted prior to his death, after which Cosimo offered to cover all of his outstanding payments to debtors in exchange for control over his collection of 800 manuscripts valued at around 6,000 florins. He never married, preferring to fill his houses with manuscripts, coins, statuary, vases, and gems.

<text>The 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games (Welsh: &quot;Gemau Ymerodraeth Prydain a&#x27;r Gymanwlad&quot; 1958) were held in Cardiff, Wales, from 18 to 26 July 1958. It was the sixth edition of what would come to be known as the Commonwealth Games, the second Games held in the United Kingdom, and the second held under the name British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,130 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including, for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man.

The Cardiff Games introduced the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, which has been conducted as a prelude to every Commonwealth Games ever since.

==Venues==

The British Empire and Commonwealth Games, including the opening and closing ceremonies, were held at the Cardiff Arms Park in the centre of Cardiff. A new Wales Empire Pool was constructed for the event. The Sophia Gardens Pavilion was used for the boxing and wrestling events, and Maindy Stadium was used for track cycling. 178,000 tickets were eventually sold during the Games. Rowing took place on Llyn Padarn in Llanberis.

==Participating teams==

36 countries and territories were represented (and 1,100 athletes), being the largest number to date, with a significant number of teams competing for the first time at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

At Cardiff Arms Park, an anti-apartheid crowd protested at the all-white South African team; games organisers responded that non-white South Africans were ineligible as their associations were not affiliated to the international federations. South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 and next appeared at the Games in 1994.

<doc id="996616" wikidata="Q3116900" url="?curid=996616" title="List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film">
<text>India has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film (formerly Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) since 1957, a year after the incorporation of the category. The award is given annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The &quot;Best Foreign Language Film&quot; category was not created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the academy presented a non-competitive Honorary Award for the best foreign language films released in the United States.

The Film Federation of India (FFI) appoints a committee to choose one film among those released that year to be submitted as India&#x27;s official entry to the academy for a nomination for &quot;Best Foreign Language Film&quot; the following year. The chosen films, along with their English subtitles, are sent to the academy, where they are screened for the jury. The 1957 Hindi film &quot;Mother India&quot; was India&#x27;s first submission. The film made it to the final shortlist and was nominated alongside four other films in the category. It came close to winning the Academy Award but lost to &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; by a single vote. Since 1984, India has not submitted a film on only one occasion; in 2003, the FFI controversially chose not make an entry as they felt no film would be in a position to compete with films from other nations. , only three Indian films—&quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001)—have been nominated for the award. In 2011, the jury of the 58th National Film Awards made a recommendation that the Best Film winners at the annual National Film Awards be chosen as the official entry.

== Submissions ==

As of 2024, India has sent a total of 57 films to the competition. 35 of the which were Hindi films (including five Hindustani films, one Urdu film and one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), three of which received nominations. Ten Tamil films (including one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), four Malayalam films, three Marathi films, two of each Bengali and Gujarati films and one film of each Assamese and Telugu languages have been submitted.

Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray has represented India three times in this competition, the most by any director. As actors Kamal Haasan and Raghubir Yadav have been part of seven films submitted for the consideration—more than any other performer. One of Haasan&#x27;s directorial effort was also submitted. Aamir Khan has represented India four times as an actor, including once as a director and four times as a producer; &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001), which he produced and starred in, received a nomination.

<doc id="996618" wikidata="Q3481283" url="?curid=996618" title="Soyen Shaku">
<text>Soyen Shaku (, January 10, 1860 – October 29, 1919; written in modern Japanese &quot;Shaku Sōen&quot; or &quot;Kōgaku Shaku Sōen&quot;) was the first Zen Buddhist master to teach in the United States. He was a rōshi of the Rinzai school and was abbot of both Kenchō-ji and Engaku-ji temples in Kamakura, Japan. Soyen was a disciple of Imakita Kosen.

==Biography==
Soyen Shaku was a Zen monk. He studied for three years at Keio University. In his youth, his master, Kosen, and others had recognized him to be naturally advantaged. He received dharma transmission from Kosen at age 25, and subsequently became the superior overseer of religious teaching at the Educational Bureau, and patriarch of Engaku temple at Kamakura. In 1887, Shaku traveled to Ceylon to study Pali and Theravada Buddhism and lived the wandering life of the bhikkhu for three years. Upon his return to Japan in 1890, he taught at the Nagata Zendo. In 1892, upon Kosen&#x27;s death, Shaku became Zen master of Engaku-ji.

In 1893 Shaku was one of four priests and two laymen, representing Rinzai Zen, Jōdo Shinshū, Nichiren, Tendai, and Esoteric schools, comprising the Japanese delegation that participated in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, organized by John Henry Barrows and Paul Carus. He had prepared a speech in Japan, and had it translated into English by his (then young and unknown) student D. T. Suzuki. It was read to the conference by Barrows. The subject was &quot;The Law of Cause and Effect, as Taught by Buddha&quot;. Subsequently, Shaku delivered &quot;Arbitration Instead of War&quot;.

At this conference he met Paul Carus, a publisher from Open Court Publishing Company in La Salle, Illinois. Before Shaku returned to Japan, Carus asked him to send an English-speaker knowledgeable about Zen Buddhism to the United States. Shaku, upon returning to Japan asked his student and Tokyo University scholar D. T. Suzuki to go to the United States, where he would eventually become the leading academic on Zen Buddhism in the West, and translator for Carus&#x27;s publishing company.

Shaku served as a chaplain to the Japanese army during the Russo-Japanese War. He lectured soldiers about how to face their own deaths with unwavering equanimity, stating that they had to defeat not only their external enemies, but also their inner enemies, which he called . In 1904, the Russian author Leo Tolstoy invited him to join in denouncing the war, but Shaku refused, concluding that &quot;...sometimes killing and war becomes necessary to defend the values and harmony of any innocent country, race or individual.&quot; (quoted in Victoria, 1997) After the war, he attributed Japan&#x27;s victory to its samurai culture.

In 1905, he returned to America as a guest of Ida Russell and her husband, businessman Alexander Russell. He spent nine months at their isolated oceanside house on the Great Highway in San Francisco, teaching the entire household Zen. Mrs. Russell was the first American to study koans. Shortly after arriving, Shaku was joined by his student Nyogen Senzaki. During this time he also gave lectures, some to Japanese immigrants and some translated by D. T. Suzuki for English-speaking audiences, around California. Following a March 1906 train trip across the United States, giving talks on Mahayana translated by Suzuki, Shaku returned to Japan via Europe, India and Ceylon.

Soyen Shaku died on 29 October 1919 in Kamakura.

<doc id="996619" wikidata="Q778403" url="?curid=996619" title="Newport, County Mayo">
<text>Newport (), historically known as Ballyveaghan and for many years also known as Newport-Pratt, is a small town in the barony of Burrishoole, County Mayo, Ireland. The population was 626 in 2016. It is located on the west coast of Ireland, along the shore of Clew Bay, north of Westport. The N59 road passes through the town. The county town of Castlebar is approx 18 km east of Newport. The Black Oak River flows through the centre of the town and there are walking paths along its banks.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Bus Éireann route 440, via Westport and Knock Airport, operates once a day in each direction. On Sundays route 440 does not operate however &quot;Expressway&quot; route 52 provides an evening journey each way to/from Westport and Galway.

===Rail access===
There had once been a Newport railway station, on the Westport to Achill line, but it closed in 1937 and today it forms part of the Great Western Greenway. The station building remains, and has been refurbished and repurposed.

Today the nearest train station today is Westport, which is approximately 14 km south.

==History==
Newport was established in the early 18th century by the Medlycott family. James Moore, working for the Medlycott Estate, designed the quay at Newport in a formal layout. The Medlycott family&#x27;s land agent was a Captain Pratt. Pratt introduced linen manufacturing to the town under the management of immigrant Quakers who relocated to County Mayo from Ulster. It would appear that, although the immigrant Quakers found living conditions in Mayo difficult, the linen industry picked up in the mid-18th century and for the next forty years or so the town prospered around the industry. By the early 19th century it again fell into decline, and it was superseded as a port by the town of Westport seven miles to the south. At the end of the 18th century, the Medlycott Estate was taken over by the O&#x27;Donel family who built Newport House, now a hotel, overlooking the harbour.

===Quakers in Newport===
In 1719 a community of Quakers came to Newport under a Captain Pratt who established a colony of linen weavers in the town which was known as Ballyvaughan at that time. Quakers, due to their reputation of being honest and hard-working tenants, were sought after by the landlords of estates at the time. Quaker communities usually prospered wherever they went, but the Quakers in Newport were reported to be in poor circumstances, and they needed support and help from other Quakers across Ireland and further afield from whom they were now far removed geographically by their remote location. The nearest community of Quakers was based in Ballymurray, County Roscommon.

The Newport Quakers appear to have had no meeting house, instead meeting for religious worship in each other&#x27;s homes. With many deaths of their young people occurring within the community in the years after resettling in Mayo, a burial ground had to be established for them in the town. The linen business interests fell on hard times and life was a struggle with constant assistance having to be brought to Newport by visiting Quakers. By 1736 the Newport Quakers started to think about moving from their settlement. They were unable to find suitable marriage partners from within their own community as they were all closely related and this caused them concern. The Newport Quaker community struggled on for a few more years and eventually bought some land in Roscommon where they would be closer to the Quaker community at Ballymurray. During the winter of 1739/1740 the last of the Newport Quakers left their Newport land and homes and moved to County Roscommon where their lives would be less wretched. Some Quakers went to America to make new lives for themselves in the years that followed.

===Convent of Mercy===
The O&#x27;Donel family, who took over from the Medlycotts, were Protestant. However, George O&#x27;Donel&#x27;s wife was a Catholic and he donated three acres of land on Barrack Hill to the Sisters of Mercy to build a convent in Newport. It was noted that when the foundations were being dug out for the new convent in 1884, many coins and buttons were unearthed, the buttons bearing the inscription of &quot;Pratt&quot;. In 1887 the convent was completed and St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent National School opened with a roll of 211 girls and 34 boys. The school was a success and numbers continued to grow. The nuns were a popular addition to Newport and local merchants donated gifts to the convent. In 1894, a lace school to train girls in the lacemaking industry opened and provided some industry - until the lace market collapsed after World War II. Due to rationalisation, the sisters vacated the convent in 1977 and took up residence in a rented building in the town. The convent managed Newport secondary school which opened in September 1956. However following the introduction of free education and free transport for second level pupils in the late sixties, the secondary school which had always experienced some difficulties in attracting a sufficiently large number of pupils was finally closed in June 1969. Since 1969 then, Newport pupils again travel to secondary schools in Westport.

===Revolutionary Period===
On 18 May 1921, Michael Kilroy sent out three sections of the West Mayo Flying Column of the Irish Republican Army to provoke the Royal Irish Constabulary RIC). The Newport raiding party of four led by Captain Jim Moran shot dead Sergeant Francis Butler of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as he returned from his home to the RIC station on Castlebar Road. Although Sergeant Butler was believed by the IRA to be one of five RIC men who abused civilians in the Newport area it is unlikely that they could recognise him from their vantage point 300 yards away .
 There was only one shot. In retaliation Michael Kilroy&#x27;s home was fired upon, and his wife had to throw herself over their baby Peadar as bullets shot t he plaster off the walls. The house was then burned down. His brother John Kilroy&#x27;s shop in Newport was also destroyed.

==Places of interest==
Newport has a disused railway viaduct crossing the river which, together with the Catholic church on top of the hill, dominate the town. St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was built in 1914 in the Irish Romanesque Revival style by Rudolph M. Butler. It has a stained glass east window of the Last Judgment, the last window completed by Harry Clarke in 1930. Burrishoole Friary and Grace O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Rockfleet Castle are both just to the west of the town. The town is an angling and tourist centre with two main hotels, Newport House (opened during the summer) and Hotel Newport (opened all year round) which are conveniently located on main street and the track of the Greenway.

The Kelly homestead, the ancestral home of the actress Grace Kelly, the Princess consort of Monaco, is situated off the main road from Newport to Castlebar near the Leg of Mutton Lake. It was visited by Princess Grace and her husband Prince Rainier during their 1961 state visit to Ireland. Grace bought the property in 1979.

<text>Newcastle West () or simply Newcastle (&quot;An Caisleán Nua&quot;, formerly anglicised Castlenoe) is a town in west County Limerick, Ireland. It is the largest town in the county, excluding Limerick city. It is also the county town, and sits on the River Arra which flows into the River Deel. Newcastle West is in the middle of a great bowl-shaped valley in West Limerick, known one time as the valley of the Wild Boar, apparently due to the abundance of this animal here when the area was thickly wooded. The crest of the town carries the image of a wild boar. The town is partly in the civil parish of Newcastle.

Newcastle West is on the N21 road from Limerick to Tralee, between Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale. It is the second largest urban center in the county, with a population of 7,209 in 2022.

== History ==

=== Foundation and development ===
Newcastle West grew up around a castle, the ruins of which are located off the town square. The large castle ruins are well maintained.

The castle was built by the FitzGerald family who arrived at some point after 1194, by 1298 the castle had been completed in stone. The town then came to be known as Newcastle, West Limerick, but over time the &#x27;west&#x27; became part of Newcastle and the town was known by the current name Newcastle West.

According to Begley, the parish was called Newcastle and Ardagh in 1704. Newcastle was joined with Monagea from 1722 until 1764 when it became a separate parish. Lewis stated that parts of Monagea and Killeedy were in the parish of Newcastle West.

Two notable mentions included in the history of the diocese of Limerick were the first Monsignor in the diocese, Richard Baptist O&#x27;Brien in 1881, and Denis Hallinan who was P.P. here and later became Bishop.

Sir William Courtenay, the local landlord, held of land in Newcastle West in the late 16th century. He was a staunch Catholic and suffered persecution for his beliefs. His son George may have practiced his faith in secret. Their home was reputed to have had a room in which priests were hidden. William Courtenay was denounced in the House of Commons as a papist recusant in 1624.

During the reign of Elizabeth I, three battles were fought near here. Tradition has it that the locals killed many of the Knights Templar. The town was sacked in 1302 and destroyed in 1315. Two of the Earls of Desmond died here. Garrett (better known as Gearóid Iarla) in 1399, and James, the 8th earl, in 1462.

Markets were held on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Large numbers used to attend Thursday&#x27;s hiring fairs for farm workers. Fairs were held on 1 April, 3 May, 12 July, 20 August, 1 October, and 10 December.

The motto that goes with the town coat of arms is &quot;As Dúchas Dóchas&quot;, which may be translated as &#x27;Our Hope springs from our Traditions&#x27;. The town now has a population of 7,209. The urban area has passed well beyond the old town boundaries which are due for redefinition.

=== 2008 flooding ===
On 1 August 2008, up to 20 homes were badly affected by overnight flash flooding in Newcastle West, in an incident described as a &#x27;freak&#x27; occurrence. A number of people had to be rescued from their houses after the River Arra burst its banks following heavy rain. There were a few injuries, however an elderly woman was taken to the hospital after she was airlifted from her home suffering from hypothermia. 3,000 homes in Newcastle West temporarily lost power. The Killarney Road (N21) was temporarily closed as was the R522 to Dromcolliher and the Bruff line.

== Business and commerce ==
The West Limerick and Newcastle West area has traditionally had a strong dairy and agricultural contribution to the local economy. Huge changes have occurred during the last 20 – 30 years seeing the expanding of the town as a services centre for West Limerick, also bringing an increase in population. Many people who work in Limerick City live in Newcastle West and its environs and commute the daily. However, Newcastle West itself is now a large centre of employment itself. Employers include Pallas Foods, Rettig Myson, Ballygowan Spring Water and Filtertek. There are dozens of businesses employing 10-50 including PSE Power Systems, Brian A Flynn, Brian Scully Services, and Nolan Products. Hundreds are employed in retail stores including local and international multiples. In recent times, there have been national success stories in e-business from local companies like HuntOffice.ie. and IrishTourism.com,

Retail outlets and supermarkets in the area include Dooley&#x27;s SuperValu, a Tesco, an Aldi, and a Lidl. The town is also has a number of clothes shops and fashion boutiques.

== Education ==
Newcastle West has four primary schools: Courtenay Boys&#x27; School, Scoil Iosaf (an all-girls school), Gaelscoil O&#x27;Doghair (an Irish language school), and a school in the countryside, Killoughteen National School. The town also has three secondary schools, named Scoil Mhuire Agus Ide (English translation: the School of Mary and Ita), Desmond College and Gaelcholáiste Uí Chonba (All Irish Second-level school on the grounds of Desmond College).

== Transport ==
Newcastle West is situated on the Irish national primary road N21, where it is joined by the R520, R521 and R522 regional roads. Newcastle West is forty minutes drive from Limerick City and an hour from Killarney. It is within a one-hour drive of Shannon, and Kerry International Airports, and two hours from Cork Airport.

The town is serviced by regular Bus Éireann buses and Dublin Coaches to Tralee, Killarney, Limerick and Dublin.

The town was connected to the railway network until 1975, as part of the &quot;North Kerry&quot; line, from Limerick city to Tralee, via Rathkeale and Listowel. Newcastle West railway station was on Bishop Street and opened on 1 January 1857. It closed for passenger traffic on 4 February 1963, regular goods traffic on 2 December 1974 and finally closed on 3 November 1975, although occasional passenger special trains, diesel and steam hauled, had operated into the 1970s. The station had an unusual layout, with two turntables and water columns for steam locomotives, the result of the lines from the Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale directions having been built by different companies. After the tracks were lifted in the late 1980s, in 1999, the former station house was restored as a private house within the Bishop Court development of the station area. The Great Southern Trail walking and cycling route follows the line of the railway, passing the site of the now demolished twin arch road bridge which spanned the lines to Rathkeale/Limerick and Abbeyfeale/Tralee just before they diverged.

== Sport ==

Newcastle West is home to numerous sports clubs, including Newcastle West GAA club, Newcastle West Rugby Football club, and had two association football clubs: Newcastle West A.F.C. and Newcastle West Rovers F.C., which amalgamated in 2018 to form Newcastle West Town AFC.

The &quot;senpai&quot; (, &quot;senior&quot;) and &quot;kōhai&quot; (, &quot;junior&quot;) relationship has its roots in Confucianism, but has developed a distinctive Japanese style. The term &quot;senpai&quot; can be considered a term in Japanese honorifics.

==Concept==

The relationship is an interdependent one, as a &quot;senpai&quot; requires a &quot;kōhai&quot; and vice versa, and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry into an organization. &quot;Senpai&quot; refers to the member of higher experience, hierarchy, level, or age in the organization who offers assistance, friendship, and counsel to a new or inexperienced member, known as the &quot;kōhai&quot;, who must demonstrate gratitude, respect, and occasionally personal loyalty. The &quot;kōhai&quot; defers to the &quot;senpai&quot;″s seniority and experience, and speaks to the &quot;senpai&quot; using honorific language. The &quot;senpai&quot; acts at the same time as a friend. This relation is similar to the interpersonal relation between tutor and tutored in Eastern culture, but differs in that the &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;kōhai&quot; must work in the same organization.

The relation originates in Confucian teaching, as well as the morals and ethics that have arrived in Japan from ancient China and have spread throughout various aspects of Japanese philosophy. The &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation is a vertical hierarchy (like a father–son relation) that emphasizes respect for authority, for the chain of command, and for one&#x27;s elders, eliminating all forms of internal competition and reinforcing the unity of the organization.

Over time this mechanism has allowed the transfer of experience and knowledge, as well as the expansion of acquaintances and the building of institutional memory. It also allows the development of beneficial experiences between both, as the &quot;kōhai&quot; benefits from the &quot;senpai&quot;″s knowledge and the &quot;senpai&quot; learns new experiences from the &quot;kōhai&quot; by way of developing a sense of responsibility. This comradeship does not imply friendship; a &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;kōhai&quot; may become friends, but such is not an expectation.

The Korean terms &quot;seonbae&quot; and &quot;hubae&quot; are written with the same Chinese characters and indicate a similar senior–junior relationship. Both the Japanese and Korean terms are based on the Chinese honorifics &quot;xianbei&quot; (先輩/先辈) and &quot;houbei&quot; (後輩/后辈), written in the same Chinese characters.

Similar concept exists in the Chinese-speaking world, though the terms vary depending on the context. In business, the terms are usually &quot;qiánbèi&quot; (前輩/前辈) for seniors and &quot;hòubèi&quot; (後輩/后辈) for juniors. For students, the term is usually xuézhǎng/xuéjiě (學長/姐, more common in Taiwan) or shīxiōng/shījiě (师兄/姐, mainland China) for male and female senpai, respectively, and xuédì/xuémèi (學弟/妹, Taiwan) or shīdì/shīmèi (师弟/妹, mainland China) for male and female kohai, respectively. The student terms are also used in the Taiwanese military and the police system, though the existence of this seniority system in parallel to the ranks is criticized.

==History==

The &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; system is deeply rooted in Japanese history. Three elements have had a significant impact on its development: Confucianism, the traditional Japanese family system, and the Civil Code of 1898.

Confucianism arrived from China between the 6th and 9th centuries, but the derived line of thought that brought about deep social changes in Japan was Neo-Confucianism, which became the official doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867). The precepts of loyalty and filial piety as tribute ( &quot;&quot;) dominated the Japanese at the time, as respect for elders and ancestor worship that Chinese Confucianism taught were well accepted by the Japanese, and these influences have spread throughout daily life. Like other Chinese influences, the Japanese adopted these ideas selectively and in their own manner, so that the &quot;loyalty&quot; in Confucianism was taken as loyalty to a feudal lord or the Emperor.

The Japanese family system ( &quot;&quot;) was also regulated by Confucian codes of conduct and had an influence on the establishment of the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation. In this family system the father, as male head, had absolute power over the family and the eldest son inherited the family property. The father had power because he was the one to receive an education and was seen to have superior ethical knowledge. Since reverence for superiors was considered a virtue in Japanese society, the wife and children had to obey it. In addition to the hereditary system, only the eldest son could receive his father&#x27;s possessions, and neither the eldest daughter nor the younger children received anything from him.

The last factor influencing the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; system was the Civil Code of 1898, which strengthened the rules of privilege of seniority and reinforced the traditional family system, giving clear definitions of hierarchical values within the family. This was called &quot;koshusei&quot; (, &quot;family-head system&quot;), in which the head of the household had the right to command his family and the eldest son inherited that position. These statutes were abolished in 1947, after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II. These ideals nevertheless remained during the following years as a psychological influence in Japanese society.

==Terminology==

The seniority rules are reflected in various grammatical rules in the Japanese language. A person who speaks respectfully to a superior uses honorific language ( &quot;), which is divided into three categories:

* &quot; (, &quot;respectful language&quot;): Used to denote respect towards a superior with or of whom one speaks, including the actions, objects, characteristics, and people related to this person.
* &quot;&quot; (, &quot;humble language&quot;): In contrast to &quot;sonkeigo&quot;, with &quot;kenjōgo&quot; the speaker shows respect to a superior by lowering or deprecating him or herself.
* &quot;&quot; (, &quot;polite language&quot;): Differs from the other two in that the deference is afforded only to the person being addressed, rather than those being spoken about. Use of the verb &quot;desu&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) and the verb ending &quot;-masu&quot; are examples of &quot;teineigo&quot;.

&quot;Sonkeigo&quot; and &quot;kenjōgo&quot; have expressions (verbs, nouns, and special prefixes) particular to the type of language; for example, the ordinary Japanese verb for &quot;to do&quot; is &quot;suru&quot;, but in &quot;sonkeigo&quot; is &quot;nasaru&quot; and in &quot;kenjōgo&quot; is &quot;itasu&quot;.

Another rule in the hierarchical relation is the use of honorific suffixes of address. A &quot;senpai&quot; addresses a &quot;kōhai&quot; with the suffix &quot;-kun&quot; after the &quot;kōhai&quot;″s given name or surname, regardless if the &quot;kōhai&quot; is male or female. A &quot;kōhai&quot; similarly addresses a &quot;senpai&quot; with the suffix &quot;-senpai&quot; or &quot;-san&quot;; it is extremely unusual for a &quot;kōhai&quot; to refer to a &quot;senpai&quot; with the suffix &quot;-sama&quot;, which indicates the highest level of respect to the person spoken to.

==Prevalence==

One place the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation applies to its greatest extent in Japan is in schools. For example, in junior and senior high schools (especially in school clubs) third-year students (who are the oldest) demonstrate great power as &quot;senpai&quot;. It is common in school sports clubs for new &quot;kōhai&quot; to have to perform basic tasks such as retrieving balls, cleaning playing fields, taking care of equipment, and even wash elder students&#x27; clothes. They must also bow to or salute their &quot;senpai&quot; when congratulated, and &quot;senpai&quot; may punish &quot;kōhai&quot; or treat them severely.

The main reason for these humble actions is that it is believed that team members can become good players only if they are submissive, obedient, and follow the orders of the trainer or captain, and thus become a humble, responsible, and cooperative citizen in the future. Relations in Japanese schools also place a stronger emphasis on the age than on the abilities of students. The rules of superiority between a &quot;senpai&quot; and a &quot;kōhai&quot; are analogous to the teacher–student relation, in which the age and experience of the teacher must be respected and never questioned.

The &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation is weaker in universities, as students of a variety of ages attend the same classes; students show respect to older members primarily through polite language (). Vertical seniority rules nevertheless prevail between teachers based on academic rank and experience.

The &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; system also prevails in Japanese businesses. The social environment in Japanese businesses is regulated by two standards: the system of superiority and the system of permanent employment. The status, salary, and position of employees depend heavily of seniority, and veteran employees generally take the highest positions and receive higher salaries than their subordinates. Until the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, employment was guaranteed for life and thus such employees did not have to worry about losing their positions.

The &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation is a cornerstone in interpersonal relations within the Japanese business world; for example, at meetings the lower-level employee should sit in the seat closest to the door, called &quot;shimoza&quot; (, &quot;lower seat&quot;), while the senior employee (sometimes the boss) sits next to some important guest in a position called &quot;kamiza&quot; (, &quot;upper seat&quot;). During meetings, most employees do not give their opinions, but simply listen and concur with their superiors, although they can express opinions with the prior consent of the employees of greater rank and influence in the company.

Outside Japan, the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation is often found in the teaching of Japanese martial arts, though misunderstandings arise due to lack of historical knowledge, and as the vertical social hierarchy of Japan does not exist in cultures such as those in the West.

==Issues==

Despite the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relation&#x27;s deep roots in Japanese society, there have been changes since the end of the 20th century in academic and business organizations. &quot;Kōhai&quot; no longer show as much respect to the experience of their &quot;senpai&quot;, the relation has become more superficial, and the age factor has begun to lose importance. The student body has diversified with Japanese students, who have spent a large part of their lives overseas and have returned to Japan, as well as foreign students without a mentality rooted in the Japanese hierarchical system.

The collapse of the economic bubble in the early 1990s caused a high level of unemployment, including the laying off of high-ranked employees. Companies since then first began to consider employees&#x27; skills rather than age or length of service with the company, due to which many long-serving employees lost their positions over being incapable of fulfilling expectations. Gradually many companies have had to restructure their salary and promotion systems, and seniority has thus lost some influence in Japanese society.

Attitudes towards the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; system vary from appreciation for traditions and the benefits of a good &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; relationship; to reluctant acquiescence; to antipathy. Those who criticize the system find it arbitrary and unfair, that &quot;senpai&quot; were often pushy, and that the system results in students who are shy or afraid of standing out from the group. For example, some &quot;kōhai&quot; fear that if they outperform their &quot;senpai&quot; in an activity, their &quot;senpai&quot; will lose face, for which &quot;kōhai&quot; must apologize. In some cases, the relation is open to violence and bullying. Most Japanese people—even those who criticize it—accept the &quot;senpai–kōhai&quot; system as a common-sense aspect of society, straying from which would have inevitably negative social consequences.

<text>Newbridge, officially known by its Irish name Droichead Nua (), is a town in County Kildare, Ireland. While the nearby Great Connell Priory was founded in the 13th century, the town itself formed from the 18th century onwards, and grew rapidly alongside a military barracks which opened in the early 19th century. Taking on the name Newbridge (&quot;An Droichead Nua&quot;) in the 20th century, the town expanded to support the local catchment, and also as a commuter town for Dublin. Doubling in population during the 20 years between 1991 and 2011, its population of 24,366 in 2022 makes it the second largest town in Kildare and the sixteenth-largest in Ireland.

==Name==
The Irish language name of the town is the official name, &quot;An Droichead Nua&quot;, meaning simply &quot;The New Bridge&quot; and was introduced in the 1930s. Noble and Keenan&#x27;s map of Kildare 1752, drawn before the town was started, marks &#x27;The New Bridge&#x27; in the vicinity of &#x27;Old Connel&#x27;. A number of other places marked on this map, including Ballymany and Morristown Biller, are represented in the names of modern housing estates and streets.

==History==

===Early settlement===
Settlement in the area dates from the 13th century (with the foundation of Great Connell Abbey) and the current town is made up of six ancient civil parishes along with portions of others. The parishes are Ballymany, Great Connell, Killashee, Morristown Biller, Old Connell, and Carnalway. Great Connell Priory was an important Priory, founded in 1202 by the Augustinian Canons.

===Beginning of the modern town===
The earliest known mention of Newbridge was by traveller and bookseller John Dunton in 1698, though he does not refer to any settlement other than at Ballymany. A mass house (Roman Catholic Chapel) was built beside the bridge about 1730 and an inn, called New Bridge Inn, was in existence in 1750. The first bridge was destroyed by floods in 1789 and William Chapman, an engineer on the Grand Canal extension to Naas, was employed to rebuild it the following year. He moved the site from the &#x27;Watering Gates&#x27; to its present location and redirected the high road from Buckley&#x27;s Cross (roundabout at Pfizer) to the new bridge, and continuing as what is today Main Street and Edward Street to the turnpike at Gandogue Lane (behind the modern Credit Union building). The old high road continued in use to serve the village and mass house, which was taken down in 1852 upon the opening of the new church (St Conleth&#x27;s).

The origin of the modern town lies in the establishment of Cavalry Barracks (1815–1819) on land purchased from three local landlords: Eyre Powell of Great Connell, Ponsonby Moore of Moorefield and William Hannon of Kilbelin. This barracks originally extended from the River Liffey to Cutlery Road, and from Main Street to Military Road, however little of the barracks remains today except the old walls and gateways which can be found on the Athgarvan Road, and to a lesser degree on Cutlery Road. The &quot;Watering Gates&quot; located at the entrance to the Town Park was also constructed as part of the original Barrack building (and as the name suggests this &quot;gate&quot; was used to facilitate access to the river for the horses from the barracks). At the same time, Eyre Powell gave land north of the new high road for building houses and shops to serve the new Barracks. Main Street took shape at the same time as the Barracks were being built. From 1819 various Cavalry Regiments were stationed at Newbridge and brought much business to the town.

Newbridge expanded rapidly after the Curragh Camp was established in 1855. Eyre Street (named after the local landlord Eyre Powell) and Edward Street (named after Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, who was stationed on the Curragh at the time) were built between 1855 and 1870. The new railway opened in 1846 and churches were built at Rosberry Common (1819 – St. Eustace&#x27;, Dominican), at Moorefield (1828 – St Patrick&#x27;s, Church of Ireland) and at Chapel Lane (1852 – St Conleth&#x27;s, Roman Catholic) to cater for the increasing population. A National School was opened on the Railway Road in 1842 (now the Parish Office) and a boarding school at the Dominican Friary in 1852. The town continued to prosper until the withdrawal of the cavalry in May 1922 on the establishment of the Free State. It went into a period of decline thereafter, but since the 1960s has seen considerable growth and has become a shopping catchment and commuter town.

Newbridge Town Hall was commissioned as a chapel-cum-school for the local barracks, completed in 1860 and converted for municipal use in 1927.

==Location==
The town is located on the banks of the River Liffey. Upriver are towns such as Athgarvan, Kilcullen and Blessington, while downriver are the towns of Caragh, Clane and Celbridge.

Newbridge is bounded by the Curragh Plains to the west, Pollardstown Fen and the Bog of Allen and Moulds Bog to the northwest. Around the Curragh, and to the east are a number of stud farms. To the south, the motorway now forms a boundary to the town.

==Industry==
The area&#x27;s industrial history includes rope making (at Irish Ropes PLC, established 1933, now closed) and carpet manufacturing (Curragh Tintawn Carpets Limited, established 1937, closed 2012). Cutlery and silverware is crafted at the Newbridge Silverware plant. Pharmaceutical companies such as Oral-B and Pfizer have also based themselves in the town, and the latter is located at Little Connell.

Lily O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, the Irish chocolatier, is based in the IDA Business Park on Green Road, Bord na Móna has its headquarters in the centre of Newbridge, and the Department of Defence has a base on Station Road.

The Kildare/Leixlip Branch of the general workers union SIPTU has its headquarters at Georges Street.

Many people living in Newbridge commute to work in Dublin.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The town is situated on the main Dublin–Cork railway line which connects the town to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Westport. A regular commuter train service operates between Newbridge and Dublin. Newbridge railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and was closed for goods traffic on 6 September 1976.

===Road===
The M7 motorway bypasses the town; the R445 connects the town to the bypass (Junctions 10 and 12 on the M7) along the route previously forming part of the N7. The M9 to Kilcullen, Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford leaves the M7 west of Naas at Junction 11.

==Shopping==
Retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer, and Zara are anchor tenants of the town&#x27;s shopping centre. The Whitewater Shopping Centre also has a 6-screen cinema, operated now by Odeon Cinemas, which opened in December 2009.

Shops such as Penneys and TK Maxx have also opened in Newbridge within walking distance of the Whitewater Shopping Centre.

==Churches==
There are a number of churches in Newbridge representing several denominations. In the Roman Catholic divisions, Newbridge is situated in St. Conleth&#x27;s Parish in the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, and the parish has a total of three churches in the town: St Conleth&#x27;s Parish Church (1852), Cill Mhuire (1983) and the Dominican St. Eustace&#x27;s Church (1966). A Church of Ireland church (1828) is located in the Moorefield area of town, and is part of St. Patrick&#x27;s Anglican Parish.

Newbridge Sports Centre hosts the African faith group &quot;The Kingdom of Heavenly Water, Fire and Mountains&quot; and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall is located just outside the town, near Milltown.

<doc id="996640" wikidata="Q269623" url="?curid=996640" title="Oldcastle, County Meath">
<text>Oldcastle () is a town in County Meath, Ireland. It is located in the north-west of the county near the border with Cavan, approximately 13 miles (21 km) from Kells. The R154 and R195 regional roads cross in the town&#x27;s market square. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

As of the 2022 census the town&#x27;s population stood at 1,409, a growth rate of more than 70% since the 1996 census (which recorded a population of 826 inhabitants).

==History==
The area was the birthplace of St Oliver Plunkett, the last Irish Catholic martyr to die in England.

Oldcastle is the 18th century creation of the Naper family who had received parts of the Plunkett estate following the Cromwellian wars. St. Oliver Plunkett, who served as Lord Archbishop of Armagh in the seventeenth century, and who was hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in Middlesex (now in the Marble Arch area of the City of Westminster in London) in 1681 on false charges, was the most famous member of this family.

It was also the birthplace of Isaac Jackson, son of Anthony Jackson III (who some say was a yeoman son in turn of the Charles II courtier, Sir Anthomy Jackson II, of Killingswold Grove, East Yorkshire, England) of Eccleston, Lancashire, England who died in nearby County Cavan after 1666. Isaac was an early Quaker in Ireland, as was his father. He moved to Ballitore, County Kildare, where he married and raised a large family, mostly all of whom emigrated with their parents to Chester County, Pennsylvania, USA in 1725.

Oldcastle suffered quite badly during the Great Famine and subsequent emigration. Owing to the continuation of a Gaelic way of life in the north of the county, Oldcastle suffered far more than the richer more arable land in the southern part of County Meath. The poorest class lived where Irish culture was strongest and were obliterated by starvation and emigration. Nonetheless, land patterns visible today still reveal a strong attachment to the pastoral farming of Gaelic culture. Politically and culturally the area has a strong tradition of support for radical republicanism, the Gaelic Athletic Association and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann; a local paper published in the town in the early 1900s gave its name to one of the Irish political parties, Sinn Féin.

Oldcastle Workhouse was located on St. Oliver Plunkett Street (formerly Lennox Street), part of the R195 (the main road to Castlepollard), on the southern edge of the town. Designed by George Wilkinson in a neo-Tudor style, and probably built in the late 1830s or early 1840s, it was demolished before the 1950s. Mellow&#x27;s Park was built by Meath County Council on the site around 1950. Many Germans, Austrians and Hungarians were interned in the old workhouse by the British Government during the First World War.

Fennor Upper and Lower in Oldcastle is said to be named after Queen Medb&#x27;s daughter, Findabair (Fennor). In Irish Mythology, she was sent as an offering to Cú Chulainn in his fight against Medb and her army from Connacht. She was killed by Cú Chulainn and the area was named after the place where she was murdered and buried.

In 1923, Micheal Grealy, a member of the anti-treaty IRA, robbed two banks – The Hibernian Bank and the Northern Bank – for which he was executed in Mullingar Barracks.

A monument was erected in 1961 in Oldcastle Square by Meath Brigades Executive, Old IRA Federation, 1916–1921 to the memory of Commandant Seamus Coogan and Commandant Patrick McDonnell who were killed by British Crown Forces during the War of Independence. The monument in the form of a cross was unveiled by Seán Dowling, Chairman of the National Federation of the Old IRA.

In November 1997 Michael McKevitt and other IRA dissidents held a meeting in a farmhouse in Oldcastle, County Meath, and a new organisation styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann was formed. The organisation attracted disaffected Provisional IRA members from the republican stronghold of South Armagh, as well as other areas including Dublin, Belfast, Limerick, Tipperary, County Louth, County Tyrone and County Monaghan.

===Oldcastle Detention camp (1916–1918)===
All of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1914 when the First World War broke out. The Alien Restriction Act 1914 was passed on 5 August 1914. The Act introduced strict controls on freedom of movement of foreign nationals and introduced a system of registration with the police. The Act also contained powers to deport foreign nationals and to intern all Austrian and German males between the ages of 17 and 42 i.e. men of military age. ‘The Oldcastle detention camp was the only permanent civilian POW camp in Ireland, detaining so called “enemy aliens”. This was due to a fear that these men would betray Britain by returning home and joining the German Army or becoming spies in Britain. Not all German and Austrian nationals residing in Ireland were detained immediately. These individuals tended to be citizens who had influential contacts and whose good conduct was guaranteed by them. However, even these men were detained eventually.

After this Act was passed, the British War Office started looking for suitable buildings to convert into detention centres. As stated by John Smith, &quot;disused workhouses were ideal. They had much of the infrastructure to hold hundreds of people: dormitories, kitchens, dining halls, water, washing facilities, an infirmary, store rooms, recreation yards etc&quot;. These also had the bonus of being easy to defend with their high walls and being on the outskirts of towns. Oldcastle Workhouse met these requirements perfectly.

In 1838 The Poor Law Act was passed which aimed to relieve the poor/destitute by providing basic food and accommodation. Oldcastle Workhouse was built and opened in 1842 to accommodate 600 people. By 1914 there were only 50 inmates living in the building. After the military approved the conversion of the workhouse into a detention centre, these remaining residents were moved to other workhouses in the area. In November 1914, the building was converted. The eight foot perimeter walls were reinforced, ‘There are nine sentry boxes around the workhouse grounds, while several galvanized houses have been erected... The grounds are surrounded by barbed wire entanglements about 5 feet high and 14 feet wide.’ Quoted from &quot;The Anglo Celt&quot;, a newspaper in the area at the time of the camp.

On 12 December 1914 ‘The long expected German prisoners arrived this week in Oldcastle and took up quarters in the disused workhouse.’ This was a headline from the time, &quot;The Meath Chronicle&quot; on the day the arrival. The &quot;Meath Chronicle&quot; reported that via a specially commissioned train 68 German inmates were transported into the town. From there they were marched through the town under armed guards to their new residence. Two days later another 26 civilians were moved into the camp. This continued steadily from late 1914 to 1915. 304 inmates were in the camp by February 1915 this number increased to 579 by June 1916. By this time every space in the workhouse was being utilised by the camp commandant Major Robert Johnson including the workhouses church sacristy. ‘Written accounts show that the highest recorded number of prisoners being held at the Oldcastle Detention Camp was 583 – the building appeared to be operating at full capacity.’ As taken from John Smith&#x27;s article on the subject. Up to thirty men were housed in a room on regulation camp beds - that is, plank beds with sacks stuffed with straw serving as mattresses - one pillow and three blankets per man.

The detainees were civilians from vastly different backgrounds. This ranged from clergymen, jewellery makers and musicians to cooks, butlers and butchers. Though the prison was not entirely pleasant the inmates had some privileges especially those who came from a better background. It was possible for the more affluent inmates to buy their own rooms and hire their own servants from among the less affluent detainees. The British wanted to divide the classes as they believed it was not acceptable to put a docker with a doctor. As part of camp life they were allowed to write and send two letters a week containing twenty-four lines. Parcels could be received and visitors were allowed for 15 minutes twice a month. One inmate, Aloys Fleischmann, a Bavarian church musician and composer, wrote to his wife and requested “three blankets and a pillow, a warm knitted Jacket, waterproof boots, a wash bowl, a kettle and mug, cutlery, tobacco and books.” This quote was taken from John Smith&#x27;s research article. We can gather from this that conditions in camp were cold, damp and basic. Although it is also reported that if they could gather 100 prisoners they would go on a four-mile march for exercise ending up in a pub in Dromone. They were even allowed to go in and buy a drink. Aloys Fleischmann kept a diary while in the camp.

A journalist visited the camp in June 1915, ‘he stated that he was “met by a large body of men” and described them as “fine strapping men”’. Account taken from John Smith’s article on the camp. These men caused no trouble for the guards but seemed bored and had nothing to do. The reported goes on to lament that they should be put to better use. Certainly, in the early days the inmates had nothing to occupy their time so this could have been the reason for four of the detainees to be sent to the mental asylum in Mullingar. By July 1916 it was reported that the detainees had formed committees to run the camp. They took charge of their own washing, drinking water and cooking. There were 3 bakers and 12 cooks among the inmates who provided all the meals for the camp. They were provided with regulation provisions which included &quot;bread, biscuits, fresh or frozen meat, tea, coffee, salt, sugar, condensed milk, fresh vegetables, cheese, butter, peas, beans, lentils and rice&quot;. Account taken from John Smith&#x27;s article on the detention centre. The rest of the men practiced their trades by making toys, jewellery, boots and wood-carving. Many men spent their days painting and sketching. The camp also had two orchestras’ which gave concerts and played for dramatic performances.

Apart from the boredom one of the other issues for the inmates was the relationships with their families. This led to many divorces and estrangement from their children. There were numerous escape attempts reported in newspapers. One of the most notorious attempts was by Carl Morlang and Aphonsus Grein who managed to escape for a few days. On the night of 14 August at 9.30 pm the prisoners were noticed missing at roll-call. Morlang and Grein left the prison and made their way northwards to Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, disguised as two clergymen. ‘At the village of Denn a few miles from Cavan, Grein entered the public house and treated all hands in lavish style.’ An account taken from The Anglo Celt. They were captured the following day by the local constabulary and returned to the camp. When they were searched they were found to be carrying maps, supplies and money which they should not have been able to obtain. Also among their belongings it was said there was a letter addressed to Charles Fox thanking him for helping them escape. He was a decorated ex-officer in the British Army and a successful businessman. He was very republican in his views so he was arrested and tried for treason, which was a hanging offence. However, the charges were dropped. He returned to Oldcastle and was treated like a hero by the locals.

Two inmates were killed at Oldcastle during the years 1914–1918. One on 17 September 1917 during an escape with another inmate. August Bockmeyer was shot when he refused to stop. Although he survived the shooting he later succumbed to his injuries. There was an enquiry and it was declared that ‘Private Tiernan’s actions to be “quite justified” in the “discharge” of his duty.’ As stated by the article by John Smith. The second, Franz Xaver Seemeier, died in January 1917. According to the information given to the press by the camp authorities, the detainee was playing football when he collided with another player and was taken to the infirmary; the following day he died from serious internal injuries. According to an account written by an internee, Seemeier was bayoneted by a guard after he had been seen approaching the barbed wire fence.

After the 1916 Rising, the political landscape had changed in most of Ireland. There was an anti-conscription meeting in Oldcastle held on 13 April 1918. The guest speaker was Arthur Griffith, a key figure in Sinn Féin. The rally was attended by thousands of people and was only 300 metres away from the camp. The speeches taking place were very Nationalist and anti-British. Prisoners watched from the roof of the camp ‘from which the meeting was visible’. Account taken from The Anglo Celt. Once the speeches had ended the crowd moved towards the prison but nothing became of this. Following this incident and the political concerns at the time, the British decided to move the prisoners from Oldcastle. On 25 May 1918, a specially commissioned train left Oldcastle to go to the North Wall in Dublin. The prisoners were then taken by ship to Knockaloe Camp on the Isle of Man. Oldcastle was returned to its previous owners the Oldcastle Board of Guardians and fell into disuse. In May 1920, during the War of Independence, Oldcastle Workhouse was set ablaze by the local IRA to stop the British using it as a military base. The main buildings no longer stand; the only thing still standing is the perimeter wall.

== Entertainment==

==Economy &amp; tourism==
Oldcastle acts as a retail and service centre for the surrounding hinterland, and is also home to a number of furniture-manufacturing and engineering businesses.

The town&#x27;s bed-manufacturing industries have included firms such as Gleneagle Woodcrafts, Briody Bedding and Respa Bedding which are a major source of employment for the area. In 1999, a fire broke out at Gleneagle Woodcrafts, killing one woman. The site has since been restored and continues to operate. A similar event occurred on the night of October 31, 2020, when a fire tore through an Oldcastle Co-Operative building.

There are the engineering firms located in the parish of Moylagh, County Meath, approximately from the town. These industries have attracted immigrants to the area for work, including from Lithuania and Poland. As of the 2016 census, for example, there were approximately 210 Lithuanian-born people living in the town.
Oldcastle is located a short distance from the Loughcrew Cairns, a tourist attraction that was built around 3300 BCE as passage tombs.

== Local geography ==
Oldcastle is located in the foothills of Sliabh na Caillaigh.

In 2005, an environmental disaster occurred in Oldcastle when a sewage treatment plant overflowed and spilled into the River Inny. 4,000 wild brown trout were killed as a result.

==Education==
There is a mixed primary school, Gilson National School, and a secondary school, St. Oliver Post Primary. This secondary school has been expanded in recent years, with the opening of a new building in 2002.
The secondary school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, opening four new classrooms on the date. Noel Dempsey and Bishop Micheal Smith were present. On 3 March 2007 the school won the All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship Senior Cup &#x27;B&#x27; Competition in Gaelic football.

Recently a new community library was opened replacing a smaller library in the town and is located next to the local Credit Union.

== Architecture ==

The Gilson National School is said by the local Chamber of Commerce to be the &quot;Gem in the Crown of Oldcastle&#x27;s architecture&quot;. The Gilson National School&#x27;s trust and building owe their existence to the generosity of Laurence Gilson, a native of Oldcastle and Moylagh Parish. A statue of Gilson was unveiled in May 2011. Gilson donated money to the town of Oldcastle in 1810 for the establishment of a multi-faith school.

The Show Hall in Oldcastle is located near the church. It hosts bingo, show dances, show bands and Le Chéile concerts annually.

<doc id="996649" wikidata="Q1406012" url="?curid=996649" title="Mikhail Rasputin">
<text>Mikhail Nikolaievitch Rasputin is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is the older brother of Colossus of the X-Men and Magik of the New Mutants. He first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #285 (Jan. 1992).

Mikhail is a mutant with substance-altering and dimension-hopping abilities. He was a Cosmonaut and the Russian Federal Space Agency tried to test his powers by sending him on a suicide mission. He was the only surviving member of his crew and returned to Earth mentally unbalanced, harboring a dangerous messiah complex.

He sometimes collaborates his efforts with other villains such as Callisto, Omega Red, Apocalypse, and Mister Sinister.

==Fictional character biography==
The older brother of Colossus, Mikhail was a Soviet Cosmonaut and was believed dead after a faulty mission where his space shuttle exploded. However, it was later discovered that the explosion was set up by the government who learned of Mikhail&#x27;s powers and wanted to exploit them without him being encumbered by ties to the past.

Mikhail was sent by his superiors into an inter-dimensional void, counting on his powers to keep him and his comrades safe, to see what was on the other side. He found a world, although he was the only survivor of his crew. He married Tra-Mai-A-Zath, daughter of the world&#x27;s ruler, the Worldly Avatar, and soon became a messiah-like figure and found himself embroiled in a civil war. During the fighting, the rift was opened, and only Mikhail&#x27;s powers could close it. He did so, but the backlash killed hundreds of his people, including his wife.

When a team of X-Men, with his brother Colossus, traveled through the re-opened rift to try and seal it, Mikhail had exiled himself into the desert. Eventually the team and Mikhail connected, and told that he had to close the void before it destroyed both this world and their home. However, having had one failed attempt that killed many, Mikhail was apprehensive to try it again. With the help of Sunfire, Iceman, and Jean Grey to control the energy backlash, Mikhail and the team were able to close the rift and return to Earth, without any loss of life.

Once back, however, Mikhail found it hard to adjust, and eventually went crazy, hearing and seeing his dead companions and loved ones in his mind, torturing him. He escaped the X-Mansion and fled into the near tunnels, where he met and set himself up as leader of the Morlocks, the tunnel-dwelling mutants beneath New York City. However after a battle with the X-Men, he collapsed and flooded the Morlocks&#x27; home.

The result being that many, including the X-Men, believed for a significant time that they all drowned to death, including Mikhail, which would become yet another source of grief in addition to the rest of his family&#x27;s death, for Colossus in the near future. This eventually led to Colossus having a fallout with Xavier.

Mikhail did, however, survive, along with Callisto the former leader of the band of outcasts and a group of Morlocks who later descended to form Gene Nation. In a world where time moves faster than normal, Mikhail had established a citadel for himself on the top of a massive hill. The philosophy of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; was the only thing which governed the society. If someone could reach the summit of the hill they were considered &quot;fit&quot; and worthy of being part of Gene Nation. Mikhail was forced to transport Storm and the Gene Nationals back to Earth, but he escaped once more (presumably back to the Hill) ranting about his benefactor being displeased with him. Storm then transported all of the Gene Nationals to a dying village in Africa where they would eke out a new life for themselves. It was discovered that Mikhail was working for the Dark Beast to try to propagate a group of elite warriors.

===Legacy Virus===
Distraught by the death of his little sister Illyana by the Legacy Virus, Mikhail decided to do something. Mikhail goes back and exposes his sister to the virus when she is in her aged form, thinking that with her magical abilities it would shield her from harm and help her to build an immunity. It was later revealed that Mikhail himself was suffering from the disease and was also trying to rid his body of the fatal virus. However, his plan backfired, and Illyana contracted the disease, her brother having been the one to administer it to her.

===The Twelve===
When Professor X temporarily disbanded the X-Men, Colossus took Marrow with him to Boston to see an art expo. While there, they were transported to the Hill by Mikhail Rasputin, and Colossus came face-to-face with his brother for the first time since his supposed suicide. The pair of X-Men ended up freeing Mikhail from the corrupting influence of a sentient energy native to that dimension and brought him back to the X-Mansion to recuperate when the entire team became embroiled in the gathering of .

Mikhail was one of the Twelve, and one of the Horsemen breached the mansion&#x27;s security to kidnap him. Colossus joined a strike force of X-Men who traveled to Egypt in order to confront Apocalypse, and his Skrull allies. In the resulting battles, Mikhail sacrificed himself to carry the Horsemen away from the conflict in a dimensional gateway. Although some Horsemen have reappeared since then, Mikhail did not reappear until X-Men: Colossus- Bloodline.

===Colossus: Bloodline===
Mikhail has made his reappearance and this time had allied himself with Sinister. The two were attempting to assassinate all of the members of the Rasputin family but one, so that the spirit of their forefather Grigory Rasputin may be concentrated and reincarnated in the last remaining member of the lineage. Mikhail teleported himself and his brother to another dimension that was a series of rocky caves. Not wanting to physically kill his brother, he decided to leave him in the rock dimension where he would die in a matter of weeks. However, away from Sinister for a period of time, he was able to overcome his mental manipulations and came to his senses, rescuing his brother. His final decision was to teleport to a world named The Dark Zone, a dimension from which it was impossible to return and also once entered, impossible to die in. This protected the rest of the Rasputin line from the depredations of Sinister as at some point Mikhail would have been the sole surviving Rasputin, which would then trap his ancestor in the dark zone. Colossus tried to persuade him to save himself, but Mikhail determined that it would be best for the possible problem and for his own insanity.

After the events of M-Day, Mikhail has retained his mutant powers.

===Dawn of X===
Mikhail has since returned to Earth following the destruction and rebuilding of the entire Multiverse. When Krakoa was established as a Mutant nation, Homo Superior from around the world began gathering in this new homeland. However, Mikhail was among the few that refused this call and instead remained in Russia because he considered Krakoa to be a threat to the world. As a result, he formed an alliance with the anti-Mutant organization called XENO where he provided them support but only against Krakoa. While examining the corpses of XENO&#x27;s enhanced soldiers in the Healing Gardens, Beast, Sage, and Cecilia Reyes were all shocked to discover that the soldiers were biologically engineered to have smaller agents nested inside. One of these small soldiers was able to steal the Cerebro Sword, murder Kid Omega with it, and used this dying body to access a Krakoa Gateway to Russia to deliver the sword to Mikhail Rasputin. 

After claiming the Cerebro Sword, he stabbed Quentin Quire and took the young Mutant to XENO&#x27;s secret headquarters. He was aware that Quire would not die as his consciousness would be uploaded into a new body via the Resurrection Protocols. However, Mikhail decided to use his corpse as a source of genetic material that XENO could use in its arsenal of genetically engineered soldiers. Mikhail then presented the sword to The Man with the Peacock Tattoo and XENO.

Furthermore, Mikhail Rasputin began using a powerful reality-altering mutant known as the Chronicler to seize control of the country, effectively building up a mutant shadow government to run alongside that of Vladimir Putin. Mikhail also forced the Chronicler to take control of Colossus from afar. He made Piotr snap Kayla’s neck, a water-bending mutant who had begun a relationship with him, and cover up the evidence, thus gaining a mole inside X-Force, Krakoa’s own CIA - and eventually in the Quiet Council itself when Colossus was later elected to a vacant seat.

==Powers and abilities==
Mikhail&#x27;s powers have always been rather ambiguous and have never fully been explained, but have been described as &#x27;energy warping&#x27;. His role as a cosmonaut was to use his powers to protect the crew and vessel from the energies of the void they were investigating on Sakhalin Island. Whilst in the world he had entered through the void, he attempted to close it to protect both Earth and the other world; &#x27;a source of energy that paralleled the void&#x27; was required, and Mikhail served &#x27;in lieu of that powerful source&#x27;, which indicates he could wield considerable energy. When the portal between the two worlds was later opened, and the X-Men came to Mikhail&#x27;s world, he served as the focal point of the atomic power of Sunfire, the control of low temperature of Iceman, and the telekinetic fields of Jean Grey, wielding &#x27;the untold energies of a thousand thousand stars&#x27; (sic). On his return to Earth, the traumatised Mikhail was shown to possess warping powers that could affect more than just energy, lashing out at a man delivering pizza and turning him into a tree, apparently killing him. Still wielding the inter-dimensional energies to which he was exposed traversing the void, Mikhail retained the ability to move between dimensions. He was able to extract from within his own body the Legacy Virus and transfer it to his sister, Illyana (reasoning that her older form, magically empowered, would be able to protect her and prevent her death). His apparent atomic or molecular control manifested in the ability to imbue inanimate objects with a degree of life; in his psychosis believing himself to be a god, Mikhail sought to animate a portrait of his deceased sister, but was dissuaded by his brother Colossus.

The Age of Apocalypse version is said to, &quot;command energy and force fields.&quot; In various appearances he is shown to be able to manipulate the substance of matter on a subatomic level and warp energy wavelengths, allowing him to fire destructive blasts and teleport through space and dimensions although the full extent and limit of his powers are unknown.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Mikhail was one of the Russian mutants that opposed Apocalypse&#x27;s invasion. He caught Apocalypse&#x27;s attention after he was able to kill War, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Being impressed by Mikhail&#x27;s victory, Apocalypse captured and brainwashed Mikhail. Mikhail became a Prelate and one of Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen and was placed in charge of the central United States. He later led a group of Infinite Soldiers back to Moscow where he discovered his brother Colossus was the new leader of the Soviet Super Soldiers. This group fought valiantly but were no match for their former leader and all but Colossus were killed. Despite the months of brainwashing, Mikhail could not bring himself to kill his brother. Colossus almost broke through Apocalypse&#x27;s brainwashing when the X-Men arrived, driving him away.

The months of experimental procedures and brainwashing he endured eventually made him lose his sanity, Mikhail went into seclusion and turned his powers into himself, significantly altering his physiology and appearance. He changed his flesh into a flesh-metal hybrid and opened up gateways in his own mind that gave him powers that even Apocalypse had never dreamed of. After years of mutating himself, Mikhail did not fear even Apocalypse himself. When Mikhail returned, Apocalypse gave him the added responsibility of being in charge of his Eurasian lands. Mikhail employed the &quot;Stryfe Force&quot; as his personal army, human servants that survived his &quot;Upscale Program&quot;, a program which turned ordinary humans into cyborgs under his control. At his side was his majordomo Keeper Murdock (the AoA version of Daredevil), who served Rasputin out of personal gratitude, as he believed his powers were the product of Rasputin&#x27;s Upscale Program. Another of Mikhail&#x27;s human allies was Bruce Banner, a scientist seeking to mutate himself, who obtained a supply of mutant test subjects in exchange for his aid.

Rasputin abandoned North America and approached the Human High Council with an offering of peace, which he didn&#x27;t intend to fulfill. The &quot;Forgotten Horseman&quot;, as he was nicknamed, captured the Council Agents aboard his ships and planned on murdering the Human High Council leaders. His plan was to assume control of all Europe using the amplified powers of the captured Empath to manipulate the emotions of all humans. However, the Council agents took control of Rasputin&#x27;s fleet. Mikhail was stopped from murdering the Council leaders by Donald Blake, who apparently killed the Horseman by stabbing him through the heart with his cane and pushing him out of the Big Ben, at the cost of his own life.

==In other media==
Mikhail Rasputin appears as a boss in &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot; voiced by Scott MacDonald. This version is a member of the Horsemen of Apocalypse whose design is based on that of his &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; counterpart. Additionally, he possesses the ability to produce energy blasts, self-duplication, superhuman speed, and the ability to bring inanimate objects to life.

<text>Oughterard () is a small town on the banks of the Owenriff River close to the western shore of Lough Corrib in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. It is located about northwest of Galway on the N59 road. Oughterard is the chief angling centre on Lough Corrib.

One of the fastest growing towns in Ireland, it had a population of 1,846 in 2022, an increase of 40.1% from the 2016 census.

==Places of interest==
Three kilometres outside the town stand the ruins of Aughnanure Castle, a well-preserved example of a medieval tower house. Much of the surrounding area was occupied by the O&#x27;Flaherty clan, but was taken over by Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster, in 1256. Ross Castle is also located a number of kilometres outside Oughterard. The mansion, which is visible today, was built by the Martin family in the 17th century but there is some evidence still present of the original castle structure, built in the 15th century by the O&#x27;Flaherty family, in its foundation.

The &#x27;Quiet Man Bridge&#x27; is located 8 kilometres past Oughterard, down the Leam Road, which was the setting for the 1950s film &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; starring John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

Also close to Oughterard, the Glengowla Mines (abandoned in 1865) is a &quot;show mine&quot; with exhibits on the lead and silver mining history of the area.

==Transport==
Oughterard railway station was opened by the Midland Great Western Railway on 1 January 1895, as part of its line from Galway to Clifden. The station, and the line, were closed by the Great Southern Railways on 29 April 1935.

There are daily buses going from and to Galway and Clifden along the N59. City Link and Bus Éireann are the two bus services that travel to and from Galway.

==Amenities==
Oughterard has a primary school, &#x27;Scoil Chuimín agus Caitríona&#x27;, and a co-educational voluntary secondary school, St Paul&#x27;s. Oughterard also has a public library, which is based in the town&#x27;s old courthouse, as well as a community centre with a public gymnasium.

== Events ==
Oughterard hosts a fishing festival every year in early May. The festival lasts for four days and includes fishing events, art exhibitions and concerts.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Oughterard GAA, won the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship in 2020.

Oughterard Golf Club, located outside the town, was incorporated in 1969 and developed in the early 1970s. It consists of an 18-hole championship course with a club house, pro-shop and restaurant.

(formerly known as Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation, and doing business as Starz Entertainment) is a Canadian-American entertainment company currently headquartered in Santa Monica, California. It was founded by Frank Giustra on July 10, 1997, and domiciled in Vancouver, British Columbia, being incorporated there.

Prior to 2024, the then-named Lionsgate owned film and TV studios under its own umbrella. They have since been spun off into Lionsgate Studios, of which Starz owns 87%.

==History==
===Formation===

Lionsgate was formed in 1997 by Frank Giustra, whose $16 million investment was augmented by $40 million from investors including Keyur Patel and Yorkton Securities&#x27; executives such as G. Scott Paterson. Giustra had recently retired as CEO from Yorkton, an investment bank, and Paterson was then president. Giustra then merged Lionsgate with Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Beringer Gold Corp. (founded in 1986) to take the company public. Beringer&#x27;s mining assets were soon sold off.

Lionsgate then began a series of acquisitions to get into the film industry. The company bought a number of small production facilities and distributors, starting with Montreal-based Cinépix Film Properties (which became the present-day Lionsgate Films) and North Shore Studios (which became known as Lions Gate Studios, until its acquisition in 2006) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mandalay Television was acquired by Lionsgate from Peter Guber for a 4% Lionsgate stake.

===Early history===
In 1998, Lionsgate helped Guber form Mandalay Pictures with a 45% investment in Mandalay. Lionsgate followed that up with a June purchase of International Movie Group, Inc. (IMG), a bankrupt film distributor previously invested in by Guber and Yorktown Securities, for its film library. IMG&#x27;s CEO Peter Strauss became President of Lions Gate Entertainment, Inc. (LGE), the American parent company for Lionsgate&#x27;s U.S. interests. The Lions Gate Media subsidiary was also formed to produce for television.

Completing its first year of operation, Lionsgate had a revenue of $42.2 million with a loss of $397,000. The company share price dropped to a low of $1.40. This limited the corporation&#x27;s ability to make acquisitions via stock swaps. Lionsgate instead made its next acquisition of Termite Art Productions, a reality-based television production company, for $2.75 million by issuing three convertible promissory notes. Giustra had the shareholders vote to move the company&#x27;s public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the American Stock Exchange, along with a two-for-one stock consolidation to qualify, for greater exposure that might boost share value.

In January 1999, Roman Doroniuk was named president and chief operating officers of Lionsgate, which led to the corporation&#x27;s financial operations being moved in April to Doroniuk&#x27;s offices in Toronto, Ontario while corporate headquarters remained in Vancouver, British Columbia. Lionsgate created US based Avalanche Films and acquired half of Sterling Home Entertainment, both in video sales. Again, Lionsgate registered losses in its second year of $9.3 million on revenues of $78.3 million with most of the losses from its stake in Mandalay Pictures. Thus in the summer, Lionsgate placed its studios up for sale with no buyers. TV operations were changed to non-network hourlong series over riskier network shows and ended its relationship with Mandalay Television. The corporation sought out more capital and cash with a filing of a preliminary prospectus for the sale of preferred stock and common stock warrants and a $13.4 million line of credit.

===2000s expansion===
Additional acquisition funding arrived in January 2000 as a $33.1 million investment from an investor group that included Paul Allen, former Sony Pictures executive Jon Feltheimer, German broadcasting company Tele-Munchen, and SBS Broadcasting SA. This led to Feltheimer taking over as CEO from Giustra thus the passed over Doroniuk left the company. Feltheimer increased film making including several $1 million films at Avalanche. However, Federgreen still remains one of the major owners of the company and is extremely involved in the making of all their major movies. In June, Lionsgate acquired Trimark Holdings, Inc. for approximately $50 million in stock and cash including taking on $36 million in debt.

Lionsgate continued making acquisitions during the decade to boost distribution and its film library. On December 15, 2003, Lionsgate acquired Artisan Entertainment for $220 million. Following the acquisition, Lionsgate relocated from Marina del Rey to Artisan&#x27;s headquarters in Santa Monica. In 2004, Erik Nelson reacquired Termite Art and renamed it to Creative Differences.

Lionsgate partnered with Panamax Films in 2005 to make movies for the Latino market which only produced two films. On April 13, 2005, Lionsgate spun off its Canadian distribution unit into a new distribution unit called Maple Pictures under the direction of two former Lionsgate executives, Brad Pelman and Laurie May. On August 1, 2005, Lions Gate Entertainment acquired the entire library of Modern Entertainment, the U.S. film division of the Swedish television company Modern Times Group. On October 17, 2005, Lionsgate acquired UK company Redbus Film Distribution for $35 million and became Lionsgate UK on February 23, 2006.

On March 15, 2006, Lionsgate sold Lions Gate Studios to Bosa Development Corporation. On July 12, Lionsgate purchased Debmar-Mercury, an independent television distributor, which has continued operations as a Lionsgate subsidiary. The company agreed in August to lease term with New Mexico State Land Office and the city of Rio Rancho for a new 52.8 acres studio near Rio Rancho&#x27;s under construction city center and arena.

On July 26, 2007, Lionsgate bought a partial stake in independent film distribution company Roadside Attractions. Lionsgate started up Lionsgate Music by June 2007. On September 10, 2007, Lionsgate bought Mandate Pictures for $56.3 million, $44.3 million in cash and $12 million in stock, and taking on $6.6 million of Mandate&#x27;s debt. Mandate Chief Executive Joe Drake returned to the company as co-chief operating officer of its film unit.

By July 2008, Lionsgate has not made any progress on building its new film studio in Rio Rancho or on setting up the corporation to run the studio per its agreement with New Mexico. In November, Lionsgate Music established a joint venture with music publishing company Wind-up Records.

In January 2009, Lionsgate purchased TV Guide Network and TVGuide.com from Rovi for $255 million cash. In May 2009, Lionsgate sold a 49% stake in TV Guide Network and website to One Equity Partners under pressure from shareholder Carl Icahn.

Lionsgate cut back its slate of films per year by four in February 2009. In April, Relativity Media signed with Lionsgate for a 5 picture per year multi-year film distribution. In August, Lionsgate signed with Redbox for a five-year same day release deal worth $158 million. Lionsgate, along with MGM and Paramount Pictures/Viacom, was also a co-owner of Epix, a pay TV movie channel which debuted on October 30.

===2010s===
On September 13, 2010, Lionsgate and Televisa formed a joint venture, Pantelion Films, to produce for the next five years eight to 10 films a year targeted for the U.S. Latin American market.

Lionsgate sold off its Canadian distribution unit, Maple Pictures, in September 2011 to Alliance Films.

Lionsgate announced on January 13, 2012, that it had acquired Summit Entertainment, producers and distributors of the &quot;Twilight Saga&quot; films, for $412.5 million. The two companies have planned on merging since 2008. On October 6, 2012, Lions Gate Entertainment announced that Brian Goldsmith became the co-COO of the company and joining co-COO Steve Beeks. On November 18, 2012, Lionsgate announced it has passed over the $1 billion mark for the first time with the success of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2&quot;.

On December 23, 2013, Lionsgate announced they have crossed over $1 billion domestically and internationally for the second year in a row with the success of &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;, &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, &quot;Instructions Not Included&quot;, and &quot;Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain&quot;.

On April 14, 2014, Comcast acquired the remaining stakes in Fearnet from Lionsgate and Sony Pictures Entertainment. On April 21, 2014, Lionsgate announced that they will merge its movie marketing operations. A few days later, on April 30, Lionsgate announced that the studios will expand into the gaming development.

In 2015, Lionsgate took over the distribution functions for CBS Films, the film division of CBS Corporation.

On February 11, 2015, John C. Malone swapped a 4.5% stake with 14.5% of the voting power in Starz Inc. for 3.4% of Lionsgate&#x27;s shares while joining the company&#x27;s board of directors. Fourteen days later, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht hinted a possible merger with Lionsgate.

On April 1, 2015, according to &quot;Deadline&quot;, Lionsgate announced it has created its new label, Lionsgate Premiere. This new label will handle up to 15 releases a year, targeting young audiences at theaters and digital outlets. The new label, part of the company&#x27;s diversification effort, will incorporate Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment titles (including the &quot;Step Up&quot; film series and the &quot;Red&quot; film series) and then specialize in &quot;innovative multiplatform and other release strategies&quot; to reach &quot;affinity audiences with branded content and targeted marketing.&quot; Marketing and Research SVP Jean McDowell will handle marketing, with distribution to be run by Adam Sorensen, who currently manages Western Sales.

On November 10, 2015, Malone&#x27;s two other companies, Liberty Global and Discovery, Inc. (now Warner Bros. Discovery), made a joint investment of $195–400 million in Lionsgate and acquired a 3.4% stake in the company. Then on June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock. As of December 2016, it became the parent company of Starz Inc.

On November 12, 2015, Lionsgate created a partnership with Armenian American television producer Craig Piligian when the studio acquired more than 50% of his Pilgrim Studios company worth $200 million. Piligian retained his position as CEO of the company while Pilgrim will continue to operate independently under Piligian. The deal made Lionsgate a major unscripted player.

On July 13, 2016, Lionsgate acquired a minority stake in British unscripted television production startup company Primal Media. It was launched by Matt Steiner and Adam Wood, who originally launched Gogglebox Entertainment that was acquired by Sony Pictures Television.

AT&amp;T also owns an approximately 2% stake in Lionsgate.

On December 15, 2017, the weekly US financial newspaper Barron&#x27;s revealed that Malone was selling nearly 108,000 class B shares in Lionsgate for $3.2 million, or $29.63 each, from December 4 to 13. Malone now owns directly and indirectly 6 million nonvoting class B shares, as well as beneficially about 6 million class A shares, which carry one vote each.

Following the Weinstein effect, Lionsgate was listed as one of 22 potential buyers interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company.

In 2018, Lionsgate&#x27;s newly launched digital content unit, Studio L, announced its first slate. In October 2018, Agapy Kapouranis replaced Peter Iacono as president of international television and digital distribution.

====2018−2023: Acquisition targets====
In January 2018, it was reported that Lionsgate was being subject to a bidding war for a possible acquisition, with Comcast and Sony Pictures having made offers.

At the time, Lionsgate Vice Chairman Michael Burns stated in an interview with CNBC that Lionsgate was mostly interested in merging with CBS and Viacom. Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company.

On February 27, 2018, a month after the bidding war announcement, &quot;Variety&quot; reported in a detailed article that toy manufacturing company Hasbro (which had collaborated with the company in the 2017 film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; via its Allspark Pictures theatrical film financing unit which is in turn owned by its Allspark division) came close to also acquiring Lionsgate, but the deal fell through. Hasbro would later go on to acquire Entertainment One (eOne; another Canadian-founded business) on December 30, 2019.

On October 3, 2019, Malone completed the sale of his stake in the studio.

In April 2021, Lionsgate&#x27;s Starz division filed an injunction in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico against The Walt Disney Company over the use of the Star+ brand in Latin America. The two companies would reach a settlement in August that same year.

In July 2021, Lionsgate purchased an 18.9 percent equity stake in Spyglass Media Group and acquired the catalogue of The Weinstein Company from Spyglass.

In 2024, Lionsgate optioned an Air Mail story written by Hannah Ghorashi, titled 
&quot;The Grift, the Prince, and the Twist&quot; .

===2023–present: Entertainment One acquisition, split from studios and rebranding===
From January 2023, Lionsgate entered a movie distribution deal with Cineplex Pictures, a subsidiary of Toronto-based Cineplex Entertainment which will see the release of selected Lionsgate titles in Canada.

In July 2023, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Lionsgate was a frontrunner to acquire Entertainment One from Hasbro. In August 2023, Lionsgate announced it would acquire the motion picture and television assets of Entertainment One from Hasbro for $500 million. Included among the assets are the trademarks of Maple Pictures, which Lionsgate divested to Alliance Films in 2011. The studio is expected to also pay $375 million in cash and $125 million in production financing loans related to the purchase. The acquisition was completed on December 27, 2023, and eOne would later rebrand as &quot;Lionsgate Canada&quot; the following year; re-establishing Lionsgate&#x27;s Canadian roots.

In December 2023, Lionsgate revealed its plan to split its film and television assets with Starz following the completion of the company&#x27;s acquisition of eOne. The company&#x27;s Studios division will merge with Screaming Eagle Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company led by Eli Baker, to form a separate publicly traded company, Lionsgate Studios. The transaction sets a $4.6-billion value on Lionsgate Studios and the deal was closed on May 7, 2024. The company was launched on May 14, 2024 and it has been trading on Nasdaq via the stock symbol LION. Lionsgate will remain the controlling shareholder owning around 87% of Lionsgate Studios following the split.

On November 28, 2024, Lionsgate rebranded to Starz Entertainment to distinguish itself from Lionsgate Studios.

<doc id="996676" wikidata="Q444285" url="?curid=996676" title="Quintus Asconius Pedianus">
<text>Quintus Asconius Pedianus (9 BC – AD 76) was a Roman rhetorician from Patavium. There is no evidence that Asconius engaged in a public career, but his familiarity with the politics and geography of contemporary Rome suggests that he may have written much of his works in the city. He was likely born into an equestrian family; his familiarity with senatorial procedure also suggests membership in the Roman Senate.

During the reigns of Claudius and Nero he compiled historical commentaries on Cicero&#x27;s speeches for his two sons, employing various sources: the &quot;Acta Diurna&quot;, shorthand reports or skeletons (&quot;commentarii&quot;) of Cicero&#x27;s unpublished speeches, Tiro&#x27;s life of Cicero, and speeches, letters and histories written during or shortly after Cicero&#x27;s times, by such authors as Varro, Atticus, Antias, Tuditanus and Fenestella (a contemporary of Livy whom he often criticizes). Only five commentaries survive, relating to &quot;in Pisonem&quot;, &quot;pro Scauro&quot;, &quot;pro Milone&quot;, &quot;pro Cornelio de maiestate&quot;, and &quot;in toga candida&quot;. The commentary on &quot;pro Scauro&quot; can be approximately dated, since Pedianus speaks of Longus Caecina (died AD 57) as still living, and implies that Claudius (died AD 54) is deceased. These valuable notes, written in good Latin, relate chiefly to historical and antiquarian matters. A grammatical commentary on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Verrines&quot; was transmitted alongside Asconius&#x27; main commentaries but has been shown to be a 5th century work.

Other works attributed to Asconius include a &quot;Vita Sallustii&quot; (biography of Sallust) referenced in Pliny&#x27;s Naturalis Historiae, &quot;contra Vergilii obtrectatores&quot; (a defence of Virgil against his detractors), and a treatise on health and long life, perhaps a symposium in imitation of Plato. 

The works on Sallust and Virgil were found by Poggio in a manuscript at St Gallen in 1416. This manuscript is lost, but three transcripts were made by Poggio, Zomini (Sozomenus) of Pistoia and Bartolommeo da Montepulciano. That of Poggio is now at Madrid (&quot;Matritensis&quot; X. 81), and that of Zomini is in the Forteguerri library at Pistoia (No. 37). A copy of Bartolommeo&#x27;s transcript exists in Florence (Laur. 5). The later manuscripts are derived from Poggio&#x27;s copy.

<text>The MPU-401, where &quot;MPU&quot; stands for MIDI Processing Unit, is an important but now obsolete interface for connecting MIDI-equipped electronic music hardware to personal computers. It was designed by Roland Corporation, which also co-authored the MIDI standard.
== Design ==
Released around 1984, the original MPU-401 was an external breakout box providing MIDI IN/MIDI OUT/MIDI THRU/TAPE IN/TAPE OUT/MIDI SYNC connectors, for use with a separately-sold interface card/cartridge (&quot;MPU-401 interface kit&quot;) inserted into a computer system. For this setup, the following &quot;interface kits&quot; were made:
* MIF-APL: For the Apple II
* MIF-C64: For the Commodore 64
* MIF-FM7: For the Fujitsu FM-7
* MIF-IPC: For the IBM PC/IBM XT. It turned out not to work reliably with 286 and faster processors. Early versions of the actual PCB had IF-MIDI/IBM as a silk screen.
* MIF-IPC-A: For the IBM AT, works with PC and XT as well.
* Xanadu MUSICOM IFM-PC: For the IBM PC / IBM XT / IBM AT. This was a third party MIDI card, incorporating the MIF-IPC(-A) and additional functionality that was coupled with the OEM Roland MPU-401 BOB. It also had a mini audio jack on the PCB.
* MIF-PC8: For the NEC PC-88
* MIF-PC98: For the NEC PC-98
* MIF-X1: For the Sharp X1
* MIF-AMG: For the Amiga, from Musicsoft

In 2014 hobbyists built clones of the MIF-IPC-A card for PCs.

== Variants ==
Later, Roland would put most of the electronics originally found in the breakout box onto the interface card itself, thus reducing the size of the breakout box. Products released in this manner:

*MPU-401N: an external interface, specifically designed for use with the NEC PC-98 series notebook computers. This breakout-box unit features a special COMPUTER IN port for direct connection to the computer&#x27;s 110-pin expansion bus. METRONOME OUT connector was added. Released in Japan only.
* MPU-IPC: for the IBM PC/IBM XT/IBM AT and compatibles (8 bit ISA). It had a 25-pin female connector for the breakout box, even though only nine pins were used, and only seven were functionally different: both 5V and ground use two pins each.
* MPU-IPC-T: for the IBM PC/IBM XT/IBM AT and compatibles (8-bit ISA). The MIDI SYNC connector was removed from this Taiwanese-manufactured model, and the previously hardcoded I/O address and IRQ could be set to different values with jumpers. The break-out box has three DIN connectors for MIDI (1xIN and 2xOUT) plus three 3.5mm mini jack connectors (TAPE IN, TAPE OUT and METRONOME OUT).
* MPU-IMC: for the IBM PS/2&#x27;s Micro Channel architecture bus. In earlier models both I/O address and IRQ were hardcoded to IRQ 2 (causing serious problems with the hard disk as it also uses that IRQ); in later models the IRQ could be set with a jumper. It had a 9-pin female connector for the breakout box. . Due to the incompatibility of IRQ 2/9 (and potentially I/O addresses) between the MPU-IMC and IBM PS/2 MCA models certain games will not work with MPU-401.
* S-MPU/AT (Super MPU): for the IBM AT and compatibles (16-bit ISA). It had a Mini-DIN female connector for the breakout box. The MIDI SYNC, TAPE IN, TAPE OUT, METRONOME OUT connectors was removed, but a second MIDI IN connector was added. An application to assign resources (plug and play) must be run to use the card in DOS. This application is not a TSR (it does not take up conventional memory).
* S-MPU-IIAT (Super MPU II): for the IBM or compatible Plug and Play PC computers (16 bit ISA). It had a Mini-DIN female connector for the breakout box with two MIDI In connectors and two MIDI Out connectors. An application to assign resources (plug and play) must be run to use the card in DOS. This application is not a TSR (it does not take up precious conventional memory).
* S-MPU/FMT: For FM Towns
* LAPC-I: for the IBM PC and compatibles. Includes the Roland CM-32L sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-1, was sold separately.
* LAPC-N: for the NEC PC-98. Includes the Roland CM-32LN sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-2, was sold separately.
* RAP-10: for the IBM AT and compatibles (16 bit ISA). General midi sound source only. MPU-401 UART mode only. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-10, was sold separately.
* SCP-55: for the IBM and compatible laptops (PCMCIA). Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-3, was sold separately. MPU-401 UART mode only.

Still later, Roland would get rid of the breakout box completely and put all connectors on the back of the interface card itself. Products released in this manner:


* MPU-APL: for the Apple II. Single-card combination of the MIF-APL interface and MPU-401, featuring MIDI IN, OUT, and SYNC connectors.
* MPU-401AT: for IBM AT and &quot;100% compatibles&quot;. Includes a connector for Wavetable daughterboards.
* MPU-PC98: for the NEC PC-98
* MPU-PC98II: for the NEC PC-98
* S-MPU/PC (Super MPU PC-98): for the NEC PC-98
* S-MPU/2N (Super MPU II N): for the NEC PC-98
* SCC-1: for the IBM PC and compatibles. Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source.
* GPPC-N &amp; GPPC-NA: for the NEC PC-98. Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source.

== Clones ==

By the late 1980s other manufacturers of PCBs developed intelligent MPU-401 clones. Some of these, like Voyetra, were equipped with Roland chips whereas most had reverse-engineered ROMs (Midiman / Music Quest).

Examples:
* Midiman MM-401 (8BIT, non Roland chip set, also sold as part of the Midiman PC Desktop Music Kit)
* Midi System, Inc. MDR-401, non Roland chip set 
* Computer Music Supply CMS-401 (8BIT, non Roland chip set)
* Music Quest PC MIDI Card / MQX-16s / MQX-32m (8 &amp; 16BIT, non Roland chip set)
* Voyetra V-400x / OP-400x (V-4000, V4001, 8BIT, Roland chip set)
* MIDI LAND DX-401 (non Roland chipset) &amp; MD-401 (non Roland chipset)
* Data Soft DS-401 (non Roland chipset) 

In 2015 hobbyists developed a Music Quest PC MIDI Card 8BIT clone. In 2017/2018 hobbyists developed a revision of the Music Quest PC MIDI Card 8BIT clone that includes a wavetable header in analogy of the Roland MPU-401AT.

== Modes ==

The MPU-401 can work in two modes, &quot;normal mode&quot; and &quot;UART mode&quot;. &quot;Normal mode&quot; would provide the host system with an 8-track sequencer, MIDI clock output, SYNC 24 signal output, Tape Sync and a metronome; as a result of these features, it is often called &quot;intelligent mode&quot;. Compare this to UART mode, which reduces the MPU-401 to simply relaying in-/outcoming MIDI data bytes.

As computers became more powerful, the features offered in &quot;intelligent mode&quot; became obsolete. Implementing these in the host system&#x27;s software was more efficient. Specific hardware was no longer required. As a result, the UART mode became the dominant mode of operation. Early UART MPU-401 capable cards were still advertised as MPU-401 compatible.

== SoftMPU ==
In the mid 2010s, a hobbyist platform software interface, SoftMPU, was written that upgrades UART (non intelligent) MPU-401 interfaces to an intelligent MPU-401 interface, however this only works for MS-DOS. It also does not work for all games. Especially early Sierra games, such as Jones in the Fast Lane, will not work with SoftMPU.

==HardMPU==
In 2015, a PCB (HardMPU) was developed that incorporates SoftMPU as logic on hardware (so that the PC&#x27;s CPU does not have to process intelligent MIDI). Currently HardMPU only supports playback and not recording.

== Contemporary interfaces ==

Physical MIDI connections are increasingly replaced with the USB interface, and a USB to MIDI converter in order to drive musical peripherals which do not yet have their own USB ports. Often, peripherals are able to accept MIDI input through USB and convert it for the traditional DIN connectors. While MPU-401 support is no longer included in Windows Vista, a driver is available on Windows Update. As of 2011, the interface was still supported by Linux and Mac OS X.

<text>Altinópolis is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo. The population is 16,203 (2020 est.) in an area of 929 km². The city is known for its sights, like the Praça das Esculturas, and its wide variety of caves and waterfalls.

== Tourism ==
Altinópolis has five rivers and 35 waterfalls. One of them is 72 meters high.

There are eight caves regularly visited by tourist, highlighted by the Itambé Cave with a façade of 28 meters and some 350 meters of galleries. The Department of Tourism gives visitors the necessary information and support. The ranking of the city was high in the last Hall of São Paulo Tourism.

For those interested in art, there are the works of Vaccarini Bassano (1914 - 2002).


===Bassano Vaccarini sculpture park ===
Altinópolis is home to a large group of sculptures of (1914-2002). He was born in Milan, Italy and arrived in Brazil after World War II and chose Altinópolis for his workshop in 1980. Praça das Esculturas (&quot;Sculpture Square&quot;), which covers at the highest point of the city, houses 42 of Vaccarini&#x27;s works. The sculpture park opened in 1992.

<text>, an early scholastic text whose title translates from Medieval Latin as &quot;Yes and No&quot;, was written by Peter Abelard. In the work, Abelard juxtaposes apparently contradictory quotations from the Church Fathers on many of the traditional topics of Christian theology. In the Prologue, Abelard outlines rules for reconciling these contradictions, the most important of which is noting the multiple significations of a single word. However, Abelard does not himself apply these rules in the body of the , which has led scholars to conclude that the work was meant as an exercise book for students in applying dialectic (logic) to theology.

==Content==
In , Abelard presents 158 questions that present a theological assertion and allows its negation. 

The first five questions are:

# Must human faith be completed by reason, or not? 
# Does faith deal only with unseen things, or not? 
# Is there any knowledge of things unseen, or not? 
# May one believe only in God alone, or not?
# Is God a single unitary being, or not?

The prologue frames the text as a professor&#x27;s guide, &quot;Aristotle, the most clear-sighted of all the philosophers, was desirous above all things else to arouse this questioning spirit ...&quot;.

An examination of these manuscripts demonstrates the existence of successive drafts of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;. 
*Z is the earliest known recension of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;, which, according to Constant Mews, dates to 1121. Parallels between Z and Abelard&#x27;s other works from this period show that Z is not an abbreviation of the TCEBS recension of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;, as Boyer and McKeon believed.
*TCEB and S belong to the next earliest recension of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;, which dates to 1121–1126.
*DL belong to an intermediate recension of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;, which likewise dates to the period 1121–1126.
*MKAk belong to the latest recension of the &quot;Sic et non&quot;, which dates to the period 1127–1132.

<doc id="996683" wikidata="Q947576" url="?curid=996683" title="Valerius Antias">
<text>Valerius Antias ( century BC) was an ancient Roman annalist whom Livy mentions as a source. No complete works of his survive but from the sixty-five fragments said to be his in the works of other authors it has been deduced that he wrote a chronicle of ancient Rome in at least seventy-five books. The latest dateable event in the fragments is mention of the heirs of the orator, Lucius Licinius Crassus, who died in 91 BC. Of the seventy references to Antias in classical (Greek and Latin) literature sixty-one mention him as an authority on Roman legendary history.

==Life==
Little can be deduced about the life of Valerius Antias. Historians surmise that his family were the Valerii Antiates, a branch of the Valeria gens residing (at least from early republican times) in the vicinity of Antium. He may have been descended from Lucius Valerius Antias.

He was probably a younger contemporary of Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius and lived in the times of Sulla. However some scholars dispute this, arguing that he lived later (perhaps a contemporary of Julius Caesar) and wrote his work after 50 BC, because Cicero does not include him in a list of historians in &quot;De Legibus&quot;. Antias was considered the most important of the younger annalists.

==Work==
The nearly completely lost work of Antias – cited as &quot;annales&quot; or as &quot;historiae&quot; – began its account of the Roman history with the foundation of Rome and extended at least to the year 91 BC. The second book told about the legendary Roman king Numa Pompilius, the twenty-second book about the capitulation of Gaius Hostilius Mancinus in 136 BC (this event Livy only reports in book 55 of his history). Therefore, the earlier times were reported much shorter than the contemporary history of the author.

The work of Antias was not very reliable. Livy criticizes his exaggerated numbers of killed and captured enemies in the Roman wars. Sometimes he seems to have even invented battles. But sometimes he also delivered correct values, which fact can be concluded from a comparison with some values given by Polybius.

Antias’ account of each year included the allocation of troops and provinces, important omen, battles, foundation of new colonies etc. At the end of the description of each year he reported about plays, temple inaugurations, and other news, in particular about events in the city of Rome. Under the influence of Hellenistic historiography Antias related his stories very long-winded and filled with sensationalism to entertain his readers. He embroidered the mostly short accounts of older historians with dramatic details and also recounted legends and miracles. He falsified the report about the trials of the Scipio brothers (compare Livy ) and seems to have invented high offices and deeds of members of his house, the gens Valeria, who lived in the early Roman republic because there were no reliable sources about these early times, which could have disproved his assertions. Antias gave a rationalistic account about the discovery of the coffins with the books of king Numa, because he had the coffins uncovered by rain and not by excavation like in the older tradition.

The style of Antias was simple, but not archaic, and Marcus Cornelius Fronto (&quot;epistel ad Verus&quot; 1, 1, p. 134, 2 ed. Van den Hout) judged his language and style to be unattractive (&quot;invenuste&quot;). Therefore, he was rarely cited literally by later grammarians.

==Legacy==
In one long-standing view of Antias&#x27; influence on Livy, the latter relied mainly on the former in Books 1-10 of &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot;, the legendary history of Rome. To elucidate this possible influence, A.A. Howard compared each of Antias&#x27; fragments with the equivalent story in Livy. He deduced that there is no evidence of such influence in the first ten books. Of twenty fragments falling within the period Livy does not use any, either omitting the information, or explicitly disagreeing with it. Howard says:&quot;The argument that Livy made free use of Antias and mentioned him only in case of disagreement is absolutely without foundation, for we have seen fourteen specific instances in which, although Livy does not mention him, he nevertheless disagrees with his statements as known to us from other sources, or absolutely disregards them...&quot;
For example, in Fragment 1 Acca Larentia willed her property to Romulus. Livy does not mention it. Fragment 3 mentions that exactly 527 Sabine Women were kidnapped. Livy says the number is greater than 30, and so on. For the entire period covered by Livy, 33 fragments of Antias come from Livy. He disagrees with six of these, criticizes eleven more, quotes Antias in disagreement on ten, and agrees with, but later disproves, two. Howard concludes disparagingly that&quot;It is on such evidence as this that we are asked to believe that Antias was the source of considerable portions of Livy&#x27;s history and that Livy followed blindly, at least in the earlier part of his work. &quot;

<text>John Capgrave (21 April 1393 – 12 August 1464) was an English historian, hagiographer and scholastic theologian, remembered chiefly for &quot;Nova Legenda Angliae&quot; (New Reading from England). This was the first comprehensive collection of lives of the English saints.

==Schooling==
Capgrave was born in Bishop&#x27;s Lynn, now King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk: &quot;My cuntre is Northfolke, of the town of Lynne&quot; (&quot;Life of St Katharine&quot;, p. 16). His parents are unknown but he may have been the nephew of a namesake who obtained a doctorate of theology at Oxford in 1390 and was also an Augustinian friar. Capgrave the younger joined the order at Lynn in about 1410 and was ordained in 1416 or 1417. He then studied theology at the order&#x27;s school in London. By 1421, he was a lector, qualified to teach at all but one of the order&#x27;s levels of schooling. He was then sent by the prior-general for further studies in Cambridge, where he delivered his examinatory sermon in Latin in 1422. He later wrote an English version of this as his treatise on the twelve orders that follow the rule of St Augustine. His progress from ordination to the degree of master of theology is said to have been the fastest recorded.

==Works==
Capgrave&#x27;s earliest work was a &quot;Life of St Norbert&quot; in English from some time before 1422. There followed a succession of exegeses, many of them now lost. His lost commentaries entitled &quot;In regum&quot; are known to have been dedicated to Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester and to John Low, prior-provincial of the Augustinians in 1427–1433 and later a bishop. Capgrave was present when the foundation stone of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge was laid on 2 April 1441 by Henry VI. Several hagiographies and royal biographies followed, including one in English of St Katharine. By 1446 he was Prior of the Augustinian friary at Bishop&#x27;s Lynn.

Capgrave paid a visit to Rome in 1449–1450 for the holy year of Jubilee and left an account that provides a glimpse into the histories, legends, traditions and public attitudes in the church at that time. Some later works were dedicated to William Grey, King&#x27;s Proctor in Rome in 1450 and later Bishop of Ely.

Only twelve of Capgrave&#x27;s 45 known works survive, including the seven in English. His , was derived from the which the chronicler John of Tynemouth had completed in 1366; this in turn was largely borrowed from the of Guido, abbot of Saint-Denis. The was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1516 and again in 1527. Perhaps the most important for posterity was his &quot;Abbreviacion of Cronicles&quot;, which provides a frame for world history within an Augustinian framework, drawing on the St Albans chronicles by Thomas Walsingham and others. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature&quot;, the book &quot;brings together what Capgrave felt were the most important events in world and later English history. He often moralized on historical incidents and consistently revealed a bias for Christians and later Englishmen in his depiction of events.&quot; His , completed between 1446 and 1453, was a collection of lives of German emperors (918–1198), English kings (1100–1446) and other famous Henries in various parts of the world (1031–1406).

Capgrave died on 12 August 1464 at Bishop&#x27;s Lynn.

<text>Richard Carew (17 July 1555 – 6 November 1620) was a Cornish translator and antiquary. He is best known for his county history, &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602).

==Life==
Carew belonged to a prominent gentry family, and was the eldest son of Thomas Carew: he was born on 17 July 1555 at East Antony, Cornwall. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of Sir Philip Sidney and William Camden, and then at the Middle Temple. He made a translation of the first five cantos of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; (1594), which was more correct than that of Edward Fairfax. He also translated Juan de la Huarte&#x27;s &quot;Examen de Ingenios&quot;, basing his translation on Camillo Camilli&#x27;s Italian version. (This book is the first systematic attempt to relate physiology with psychology, though based on the medicine of Galen. )

Carew was a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries, and is particularly known for his &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602), the second English county history to appear in print. Later editions were published in 1723, 1769 and 1811, and Davies Gilbert published an index in his &quot;Cornwall&quot;, vol. 4, pp. 381–92. He also published an &quot;Epistle concerning the Excellencies of the English Tongue&quot; (1605).

Carew served as High Sheriff of Cornwall (1583 and 1586), and as MP for Saltash in 1584. He was married to Juliana Arundell, the eldest daughter of Sir John Arundell of Trerice; their son Richard Carew was created a baronet in 1641 (see Carew baronets).

Carew died on 6 November 1620 and was buried in Antony church on 7 November.

<doc id="996688" wikidata="Q1077786" url="?curid=996688" title="Palatine of Hungary">
<text>The Palatine of Hungary ( or , , ) was the highest-ranking office in the Kingdom of Hungary from the beginning of the 11th century to 1848. Initially, Palatines were representatives of the monarchs, later (from 1723) the vice-regent (viceroy). In the early centuries of the kingdom, they were appointed by the king, and later (from 1608) were elected by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary. A Palatine&#x27;s jurisdiction included only Hungary proper, in the Kingdom of Croatia until 1918 the ban held similar function as the highest office in the Kingdom (after the king himself), monarch&#x27;s representative, commander of the royal army and viceroy (after the union of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia with Hungary in 1102).

== Title ==

The earliest recorded Medieval Latin form of the title was &quot;comes palatii&quot; (&quot;count of the palace&quot;); it was preserved in the deed of foundation of the Tihany Abbey, issued in 1055. A new variant &quot;(comes palatinus)&quot; came into use in the second half of the ; it was first recorded around 1067. The shortened &quot;palatinus&quot; form became the official version in the 1230s. A new official title&quot;palatinus regni Hungariae&quot; (&quot;Palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;)was adopted in the 1340s, which shows that the palatines who were still royal officials were also regarded as representatives of the Estates of the realm from that time on.

The original Hungarian version of the title was &quot;nádorispán&quot;; it was first recorded around 1405. The etymology of the word is uncertain. Most scholars agree that its root is the Slavic word for court &quot;(dvorjь)&quot;, but no documents evidence that the assumed &quot;*nadъ-dvorjь-županъ&quot; (&quot;head of the royal court&quot;) form actually existed. In Czech and Serbo-Croatian languages, similar expressions (&quot;náderšpan&quot; and &quot;nadršpan&quot;) existed, but only as loanwords from Hungarian, in reference to the palatines of Hungary.

Ludovicus Tubero and some other 16th-century scholars referred to the palatine as &quot;nándorispán&quot;. Historian András Róna-Tas says that the title may be connected to the Bulgars&#x27; old Hungarian exonym &quot;(nándor)&quot;. If his theory is valid, the palatine was originally the head of the Bulgars in Hungary. Other scholars have not accepted Róna-Tas&#x27;s theory, because the &quot;nándorispán&quot; version seems to have developed from the original &quot;nádorispán&quot; version. The modern Hungarian version of the title &quot;(nádor)&quot;, which is the shortened version of the original title, was first recorded in 1784.

== History ==
=== Origins ( 1000– 1100) ===

High-ranking officials who bore the title &quot;comes palatinus&quot; or &quot;comes palatii&quot; were present in several royal courts of medieval Europe. In the Carolingian Empire, the &quot;comes palatii&quot; was the monarch&#x27;s deputy and one of the highest judges in the , according to the contemporaneous Hincmar. In Croatia, the &quot;zuppanus palatii&quot; was the head of the royal court in 892. In 11th-century Bohemia and in Poland, the &quot;count of the palace&quot; was the monarch&#x27;s deputy in military affairs. According to a scholarly theory, the &quot;comes palatii&quot; was originally responsible for the administration of the royal household, but primary sources do not contain direct reference to the palatines&#x27; economic functions.

Hungarian historians agree that the imperial court of the Holy Roman Empire set the pattern for the organization of the royal household in Hungary. Historians also concur that the first king of Hungary, Stephen I, who died in 1038, appointed the first palatine, although no primary source mentioned this office during his reign. György Györffy says that one &quot;Comes&quot; Ceba, who was responsible for the transfer of ten villages to the Pannonhalma Archabbey on the king&#x27;s behalf around 1005, must have been a palatine, because the villages were situated in many counties, suggesting that he was not the head of one county. The &quot;Long Life of Saint Gerard&quot; say that King Stephen I made Csanád &quot;the master of the household of the king and Ajtony&quot; after Csanád defeated Ajtony. Some historians (including Györffy and Gábor Thoroczkay) say that the text suggests that Csanád held the office of palatine for some time during Stephen&#x27;s reign; other historians (for example, Tibor Szőcs and Tibor Almási) write that the author of the legend borrowed the expression from Psalm 105 which mentioned the &quot;master&quot; of the king&#x27;s household. Nevertheless, Gerard of Csanád&#x27;s same legend preserved the earliest historical event in connection with a palatinethe dethronement of Stephen I&#x27;s successor, Peter Orseolo by &quot;Count Palatine Aba&quot; in 1041. According to modern scholars&#x27; consensus, Aba, who was Stephen I&#x27;s brother-in-law or nephew, must have been made palatine by Stephen I.

A decree of King Coloman the Learned stated that messengers sent by the &quot;ispáns&quot; from the borderlands to the monarch were entitled to &quot;claim the cost of travel and an equal amount for the return journey&quot; from the palatine. No other primary sources contain direct evidence of the first palatines&#x27; economic duties, but other royal officials who were mentioned in 11th-century royal charters (including the &quot;ispáns&quot; and the stablemen) do not seem to have been responsible for the management of the royal household. Consequently, most historians say that most probably the palatines were the administrators of the royal domains and revenues up until the 1120s. The palatines&#x27; jurisdiction over the &quot;udvornici&quot;, or royal serving people, which is documented from the end of the , also validate this theory. The late 13th-century chronicler, Simon of Kéza, stated that it was King Coloman who had &quot;made over his own &quot;udvornici&quot; for the use of the palatine of the realm&quot;, but Kéza&#x27;s testimony is suspect.

In his &quot;Admonitions&quot;, King Stephen I declared that the kings should not judge legal cases in person, suggesting that a high-ranking official administered justice on the kings&#x27; behalf already in the first half of the . Modern historians agree that the palatine was that high official. A law-book, issued during or shortly before the reign of King Ladislaus I of Hungary, preserved the first reference to the palatines&#x27; judiciary function, ordering that a palatine who administer justice to people who fell outside his jurisdiction should pay a fine of &quot;fifty-five &quot;pensae&quot;&quot; (the equivalent to 2,000 pence). The same decree also ruled that the &quot;count of the duke&quot; was to pay the same amount if &quot;he judges others besides his own people&quot;, which suggests that the head of the &quot;duchy&quot; was also entitled to appoint his own palatine.

=== Middle Ages ( 1100–1485) ===

A new great officer, the &quot;curialis comes&quot;, appeared in the royal court in the first half of the . He was responsible for the management of the royal household. Authentic royal charters do not prove that the &quot;curialis comes&quot; administered justice on the king&#x27;s behalf in the royal court in the , but according to a scholarly theory, he heard disputes in the royal court already during the reign of King Coloman&#x27;s son, Stephen II of Hungary, which gave rise to the development of the palatines&#x27; own court of justice. The &quot;curialis comes&quot; was mentioned as &quot;iudex curie&quot;, or royal judge, after around 1219. Changes in the administration of the royal court and the palatines&#x27; office occurred around the same period. Hereafter the highest-ranking royal officials, including the palatine and the royal judge, were styled as &quot;barons&quot;.

The first documents issued in a palatine&#x27;s name is dated to about 1219. Up to that time, the palatines&#x27; decisions had not been recorded by their own officials, but by other authorities, especially by cathedral chapters. The earliest references to the palatines&#x27; deputies, who were later known as vicepalatines or the palatines&#x27; vicejudges, were also recorded in 1219. From the 1230s, the monarchs occasionally entrusted the palatines, along with other barons of the realm, with specific tasks. For instance, Andrew II sent Denis, son of Ampud on diplomatic missions; Stephen Gutkeled destroyed mills built without permission on the river Rába on Béla IV&#x27;s orders.

The palatines acted as itinerant judges, wandering in the whole realm in the 1230s and early 1240s. Roland Rátót, who became palatine in 1248, abandoned this practice and mostly heard cases in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). After Béla IV of Hungary and his son, Stephen divided the country along the river Danube in 1262, Stephen, who adopted the title of &quot;junior king&quot;, set up his own royal court and made Denis Péc his palatine. Andrew III, who was crowned king in 1290, often made two influential noblemen palatines. During the interregnum that followed Andrew III&#x27;s death, many oligarchs were styled palatines, including Amadeus Aba, Matthew Csák and Stephen Ákos.

He was also the judge of the Jászok (Alans), of the Cumanians and of the Jews. Title of Palatine is abolished in 1848.

From 1200, he was also the comes of several counties, thus being entitled to one third of the county taxes. From the 13th century, his deputy (&quot;vicepalatinus&quot;) was based in Pest (around 1300 temporarily in Old Buda), where he was simultaneously the county leader of the Pest county and judge of the middle nobility.

According to the Article II of Law 1439, the king could appoint the palatine only with the consent of the parliament. &lt;br&gt;
The Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary of 1455 and 1456 issued the decree &quot;de officio Palatini&quot;, which guaranteed the palatine&#x27;s position as the representative of the king.

From around 1400 he was the viceregent of the king, a function which however only became important after 1526. He was allowed to command the royal army and to preside over the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary instead of the king. When the king was not of age or if there was an interregnum, he also could convene the Diet. From around 1450 he had the right to grant royal property – like the king himself but with certain restrictions. An act of 1485 explicitly stipulated that the palatine shall be the viceregent in the king&#x27;s absence.

=== Early Modern Times (1485–1608) ===

After 1526, when the Habsburgs became rulers of the kingdom and the Turks seized large parts of the kingdom, the palatine, as the vice-regent (viceroy), had his seat outside Royal Hungary in Prague and later in Vienna. In 1526, the palatine became a life function. In 1527, the palatine István Báthory created the Hungarian Vice-regency Council (a kind of government, seat in Pozsony (German: Pressburg, now Bratislava) since 1531) comprising also other noble representatives, which became a permanent institution headed by the palatine in 1549. In 1608, the functions of vice-regent and palatine were separated. The Palatine&#x27;s office was suspended in 1673 when Emperor Leopold I appointed a Directorium to more directly administer Hungary in the crackdown that followed the Magnate conspiracy, however the office was restored in 1681. The Vice-regency council was abolished in 1673, but renewed in 1723, when the palatine became the official president of the council.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the palatine Archduke Stephen, a member of a junior branch of the Habsburgs, was a significant intermediary between the revolutionaries and the imperial court in Vienna. However, after 1848, the palatine was only a symbolic function, but it was only in 1918 – with the end of Habsburgs in the Kingdom of Hungary (the kingdom continued formally until 1945) – that the function ceased officially.

== Functions ==
=== Deputy of the monarch ===

The Golden Bull of 1222 authorized the palatine to represent the monarch at the great assembly which was customarily held at Székesfehérvár on the feast of King St Stephen in each year. The presence of the palatine at the yearly law-day enabled him to act as a mediator between the sovereign and the noblemen.

=== Judicial functions ===

Initially, the palatines administered justice on the kings&#x27; behalf, primarily in the royal court. A decree, attributed to King Ladislaus I, explicitly forbade the palatine from &quot;send[ing] the seal&quot; to anyone &quot;except only to those who are called &quot;[udvornici]&quot; and to those who come to him voluntarily&quot; while he was absent from the royal court. On the other hand, the decree also shows that in the second half of the , the palatine&#x27;s jurisdiction over the &quot;udvornici&quot; was independent of his role as the sovereign&#x27;s deputy. Around 1100, King Coloman authorized the palatine to hear appeals against decisions of judges from the counties &quot;if a popular outcry arises against them&quot;. Four royal charters show that the palatines, along with other high-ranking royal officials, occasionally heard disputes between ecclesiastic institutions and royal people as judges, specifically assigned with the task by the monarchs in the .

The palatines&#x27; own court of justice is documented from the early 13th century. In 1201, King Emeric exempted the &quot;guest settlers&quot; in Sárospatak from the jurisdiction of all judges but the king and the palatine, which proves that the palatines had already heard cases on their own right, not only as the monarchs&#x27; representatives. The Golden Bull of 1222 declared that a palatine had jurisdiction over all inhabitants of Hungary, although he was only authorized to condemn a nobleman to death or confiscate a nobleman&#x27;s property if the monarch had consented to it. The same decree was completed with a sentence which confirmed the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts (including the clergymen&#x27;s immunity) in accordance with customary law when King Andrew II of Hungary confirmed the Golden Bull on the prelates&#x27; demand in 1231.

== Deputies ==

The earliest charters referring to the palatines&#x27; deputies mentioned them under several names, including &quot;vicarius palatini&quot; (in 1220 and 1221), and &quot;vicecomes palatini comitis&quot; and &quot;viceiudex palatini comitis&quot; (in 1221). The same documents, all preserved in the &quot;Regestrum Varadinense&quot; (including Maurice Pok), suggest that the palatine and his deputies administered justice during the same period but in faraway territories: while Palatine Nicholas Szák heard cases in the lands east of the river Tisza, his deputies worked in Transdanubia in 1220. This practise was obviously unpopular, because the Golden Bull of 1222 explicitly stated that the palatine &quot;shall have no deputy judge except for the one at his own court&quot;.

==Important palatines==

Important families that provided several palatines were: in the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th century were the Aba (family), Lackfi, in the 15th century the Garay, afterwards the Báthory and the Zápolya, Esterházy, Pálffy, and ultimately the Joseph branch of the Habsburg.

Prominent palatines have been: in the early 17th century, István Illésházy of Trencsén, then up to 1616, György Thurzó and János Zakmárdi. Thurzó is the palatine who arrested Elizabeth Báthory, the countess accused for killing numerous girls and young women. The position was occupied in the remaining 17th century by members of the families Esterházy, Pálffy, Francis Wesselényi, Rhedey and others. The last palatines at the end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century were the Habsburgs Archdukes Alexander Leopold, Joseph and his son Stephen, who resigned in 1848. Following Stephen&#x27;s death in 1867 without issue, his half-brother Archduke Joseph August of Austria inherited the title, though the post by that time was symbolic only.

<text>Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius was a Roman historian. Little is known of Q. Claudius Quadrigarius&#x27;s life, but he probably lived in the .

==Work==
Quadrigarius&#x27;s annals spanned at least 23 books. They began with the conquest of Rome by the Gauls (BCE), reached Cannae by Book 5, and ended with the age of Sulla, or 82BCE.

The surviving fragments of his work were collected by Hermann Peter. The largest fragment is preserved in Aulus Gellius, and concerns a single combat between T. Manlius Torquatus and a Gaul.

==Legacy==
Quadrigarius&#x27;s work was considered very important, especially for the contemporary history he narrates. From its sixth book onward, Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; used Quadrigarius and Valerius Antias as major sources, (if not uncritically), and it seems Livy especially drew on Quadrigarius for trophies placed in the Capitoline temple and lost before Livy&#x27;s time in the fire of 83 BCE. He is cited by Aulus Gellius, and he was probably the &quot;Clodius&quot; mentioned in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Numa&quot;.

The judgment of his prose has varied. Some considered that it was his lively style which ensured his survival in various extracts; but more perhaps would agree with Fronto that his language was pure and colloquial (“puri ac prope cotidiani sermonis”), and that it benefited from its straightforwardness, and absence of archaisms.

<text>Irving Oil Ltd. is a Canadian privately-owned intergenerational gasoline, oil, and natural gas producing and exporting company, a subsidiary of the parent company Irving Group of Companies, one of the largest &quot;private conglomerates&quot; in North America. Irving Oil was established in 1924 by Canadian oil baron and billionaire, Kenneth &quot;K.C.&quot; Irving, whose family fortune when he died in 1992 was estimated by Forbes at USD$5 billion. His son, Arthur, became chairman and president of Irving Oil. Arthur Irving died in 2024. 

Irving Oil operates Canada&#x27;s largest refinery, the Irving Oil Refinery, in Saint John, New Brunswick, and Ireland&#x27;s only refinery, in Whitegate, County Cork, as well as a network of gasoline stations, fleet of oil tankers, real estate and other related assets. Irving Oil&#x27;s Home Office is located in Uptown Saint John and was officially opened in 2019.

==History ==
===Origins===
In April 1924, Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving, a then-25-year-old automobile salesman, started what would later become Irving Oil when he opened his first filling station in his hometown of Bouctouche. On October 13, 1925, Irving took control over the Ford dealership business in Saint John. Most modern sources attribute 1924 as being the year Irving Oil was founded; the first incorporation of a company which eventually led to the establishment of Irving Oil was &quot;K. C. Irving, Limited&quot;, which took place in late November 1926. Afterwards, the incorporation of &quot;K. C. Irving Oil and Gas Company, Limited&quot;, which was done under Nova Scotia jurisdiction, took place in May 1928. Irving Oil was then incorporated in February 1929 as &quot;Irving Oil Company, Limited&quot;, with the newly-formed company being headquartered in Saint John; it acquired the preceding &quot;K. C. Irving Oil and Gas Company, Limited&quot;, the &quot;gasoline and oil division&quot; of &quot;K. C. Irving, Limited&quot;, as well as the Bore Motor Fuel Company, a Moncton-based company previously unrelated to Irving which was incorporated on March 20, 1924. By November 1929, the company expanded; throughout the Maritime provinces, Irving Oil Company went from 10 wholesale bulk stations to 30 since its formation earlier that year. The company also went from having 27 retail service stations distributing its products to 450. The following year, the company went forward with developments toward creating an oil plant; the Saint John Harbor Commissioners leased out land for the company to go through with these developments. In August 1931, an unconfirmed report claimed that the company was acquired by Imperial Oil; by the end of that year, Irving Oil had grown to become one of the largest gasoline distributors in the Maritimes.

The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.

===Environmental initiatives===
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.

Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.

The resignation of president Ian Whitcomb, in February 2024, amid ongoing leadership changes and a strategic review, suggests potential significant shifts in the future direction of the company.

==Operations==
===Refining===
In 1960, the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery on the east side of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL&#x27;s share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada&#x27;s largest refinery, processing over . In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America&#x27;s lowest-emission petroleum.

Since 1970, the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009, this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the &quot;Eider Rock Refinery&quot; and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc. On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.

===Distribution===
====Marine====

Irving Oil&#x27;s core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.

The &quot;Irving Whale&quot;, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil&#x27;s sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.

In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.

====Road====
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil&#x27;s home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.

Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil&#x27;s wholesale deliveries, as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.

====Rail====
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.

Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

===Retail network===
Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.

Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.

====Convenience stores====
Most of Irving Oil&#x27;s corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply &quot;Irving&quot; stations until the late 1990s, when the &quot;Mainway&quot; banner (&quot;Marché Mainway&quot; in Quebec) was introduced; &quot;Mainway&quot; being a brand appropriated from one of Irving&#x27;s U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company&#x27;s Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard&#x27;s fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old &quot;Mainway&quot; stations under the name &quot;Bluecanoe&quot; as part of the company&#x27;s modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name &quot;Mainway&quot;.

On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of its gas stations in Atlantic Canada and New England to Couche-Tard for 20 years. Their gas remain supplied by Irving, but their convenience stores were converted to Circle K. In 2018, following Couche-Tard&#x27;s acquisition of CST Brands (which saw most of its Canadian assets sold to Parkland Fuel), 36 Ultramar gas stations in Atlantic Canada were converted to Irving/Circle K locations. Of them, 13 were in turn sold to Irving Oil and leased by Couche-Tard.

====Big Stops====

Irving Oil also operates several &quot;Big Stops&quot;, which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland.

They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.

In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called &quot;The Silver Fox&quot;; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called &quot;The Blue Canoe&quot;; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called &quot;The Back Forty&quot;; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called &quot;Crossing&quot; - the original name for the community.
==Criticisms==
Examples of vertical integration within the &quot;Irving Group of Companies&quot; (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate&#x27;s facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies.

J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. James Irving also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.

The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2000, New Brunswick New Democratic Party leader Elizabeth Weir released documents accessed under the &quot;Right to Information Act&quot; surrounding $1 billion upgrades being put in motion for the oil refinery by the government without being completely assessed for its environmental impact, suggesting that the government &quot;ignored the public interest and pandered to big business.&quot;

The July 2013 Lac-Mégantic, Quebec rail tanker explosion increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery there. Irving Oil&#x27;s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents. Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.

There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.

&quot;The Dominion&quot; newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving&#x27;s ownership of Brunswick News, as well as the newspapers&#x27; journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil. Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies&#x27; ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.&quot; The report went further, stating, &quot;the Irvings&#x27; corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province&quot; to a degree &quot;unique in developed countries.&quot; At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers&#x27; lack of critical reporting on the family&#x27;s influential businesses.

There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.

=== Irving Oil and taxes ===
In 1987, Irving Oil sued the federal government for $141 million, citing the amount as being &quot;taxes and interest&quot; which were &quot;wrongly assessed against the company from 1971-75.&quot; In response, the government alleged that Irving Oil used a &quot;sham&quot; price system to &quot;hide swollen profits from Revenue Canada, which has disallowed the company&#x27;s claimed costs.&quot;

==== Tax breaks and concessions ====
In 1981, the provincial government, then-led by Richard Hatfield, granted a tax exemption towards provincial property taxes for Irving Oil&#x27;s Canaport crude oil farm. Hatfield, who, according to CBC News, &quot;was on record opposing special tax treatment for Irving Oil&#x27;s Canaport oil terminal,&quot; granted the exemption following the 1979 oil crisis. Despite the issues caused by the crisis having long been resolved, the tax exemption has never been removed, saving Irving Oil from having to pay for over $20 million in property taxes since its introduction. Blaine Higgs, the current Premier and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, stated during a 2016 CBC interview with Harry Forestell that he would &quot;support ending a provincial property-tax exemption on Irving Oil&#x27;s Canaport oil terminal, if a review showed it was no longer needed,&quot; though progress regarding the matter has yet to have been made, despite calls for the removal of the exemption, including by provincial Green Party leader David Coon, whose campaign for the 2018 election included the removal of the exemption. In March 2023, Service New Brunswick accidentally reverted the exemption and charged Irving Oil about $580,000 in Canaport property taxes, in what was described as an &quot;inadvertent internal computer incident.&quot; The charge was later reverted and the exemption was reinstated.

In March 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial municipal tax concessions for the Canaport site which were initially passed by the Saint John City Council and subsequently the Progressive Conservative government led by Bernard Lord. The concessions, which reduced Irving Oil&#x27;s municipal property taxes from $8 million down to being capped at $500,000 until 2030, were initiated in order to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city&#x27;s then-mayor Norm McFarlane. The concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million. The tax break was cancelled in December, 2016 at the request of Saint John city council, with unanimous support in the Legislative Assembly. In 2015, the &quot;Telegraph-Journal&quot;, a daily newspaper then-owned by Irving, published an editorial arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest. In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil&#x27;s refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.

In 2022, it was revealed through leaked financial documents that during 2005, the same year that they had persuaded municipal and provincial governments in what ultimately granted them the tax concessions, Irving Oil made $250.7 million in profits. The corporation even profited $111.2 million during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which severely dropped oil prices.

<text>Henry Carey (c. 26 August 1687 – 5 October 1743) was an English poet, dramatist and composer. He is remembered as an anti-Walpolean satirist and also as a patriot. Several of his melodies continue to be sung today, and he was widely praised in the generation after his death. Because he worked in anonymity, selling his own compositions to others to pass off as their own, contemporary scholarship can only be certain of some of his poetry, and a great deal of the music he composed was written for theatrical incidental music. However, under his own name and hand, he was a prolific songwriter and balladeer, and he wrote the lyrics for almost all of these songs. Further, he wrote numerous operas and plays. His life is illustrative of the professional author in the early 18th century. Without inheritance or title or governmental position, he wrote for all of the remunerative venues, and yet he also kept his own political point of view and was able to score significant points against the ministry of the day. Further, he was one of the leading lights of the new &quot;Patriotic&quot; movement in drama.

==Early life==
Henry Carey was born in London and was the illegitimate son of George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax. Carey did not make the claim himself, but he did use &quot;Savile&quot; as the name of three of his male children, and these corresponded to the births of Halifax&#x27;s own three sons. Furthermore, he dedicated all of his major works to Halifax (Gillespie 127). His biography in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; also stated that Carey received a &quot;generous annuity&quot; from the Savile family, but that seems less likely and remains unconfirmed. The fact that, even when his most popular plays were on the boards, Carey would write for pay argues against such an annuity.

Aside from rumor, it is impossible to be sure of Carey&#x27;s parents. It is possible that a Henry and a Mary Carey, both school teachers, were his parents. Indeed, his first profession, according to Richard Hawkins, was as a music teacher in a boarding school for the middle gentry, a position he held while also working as an author, so these two Careys are the most likely candidates for at least his surrogate, if not his biological, parents.

==Early musical and literary work==
Scholars have trouble identifying Carey&#x27;s first works, because he was probably writing anonymously. 
According to Laetitia Pilkington, friend of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s and other Tory wits, Carey worked as a &quot;subaltern&quot; to James Worsdale later in his life, in 1734, when he was best paid and most famous. 
Since he was writing for pay when he had theatrical successes, it seems reasonable that he had been hiring his pen for quite some time. 
In the 18th century, he did hack work for the periodicals of the day. His first accredited work was a weekly publication of a serialized romance fictions entitled &quot;Records of Love&quot; in January through March 1710. 
This work was aimed at a female readership and was written with a clear expectation of an intelligent, educated, and populous set of readers. He also appears as a singer of Italian and English entre-acte songs at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane around 1710 (Gillespie 127). His first poetry publication came in 1713, the year of the height of the Tory ministry under Queen Anne with &quot;Poems on Several Occasions.&quot;

In 1714, Carey had a job as a psalmist at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn church and also at Drury Lane. He performed there with his music students. The Tory ministry fell with the death of Anne, and Robert Walpole&#x27;s Whigs were on the rise. The leaders of the former government, Robert Harley and Henry St. John, were accused of treason over the coming months, and, while St. John fled, Harley was imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1715, Carey wrote his first play, an afterpiece entitled &quot;The Contrivances.&quot; On 13 July 1717, Carey lost both of his posts, at Drury Lane and at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, for a singular political statement: Harley had just been freed from the Tower and had attended Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Church, and Carey set Psalm 124 to a jaunty, celebratory tune and sang it. The Psalm concerns the Exodus of the Israelites, announcing that 
:&quot;If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
:Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
:Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul.&quot;
It concludes with &quot;Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.&quot;
Even though Carey lost those two positions, he was soon back at Drury Lane, and he married Elizabeth Pearks in September. He produced his second play, &quot;Hanging and Marriage&quot;, in 1722. The theatrical seasons of 1723 and 1724 were dominated by pantomime and spectacle plays in London (inducing a young William Hogarth to satirize the abandonment of drama for puppets), and Carey provided the music to some of these productions. In 1723, he wrote the music for &quot;Harlequin Dr. Faustus&quot; (text, such as it was, by Barton Booth) at Drury Lane. From 1723 to 1733, Carey was the &quot;unofficial composer in residence&quot; for Drury Lane, and he wrote and performed much of the music between acts, preludes, and epilogue music, as well as the music called for by dances and other entertainments in the plays (Gillespie 127).

Henry Carey never ceased to be a composer nor to work as a singer and musician. Even as he began to have greater success as a poet and playwright, he continued to work in music. He worked in a theatre that was associated with the Whig party. Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, and Barton Booth were patronized first by Joseph Addison and his circle and then by Robert Walpole and his circle, and yet Carey appears to have been an unambiguous supporter of the Tory ministry of Henry St. John and Harley and the literary circle of Alexander Pope. When, therefore, Pope satirized the theatrical vacuity of the pantomime stage in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, he was aiming not at the musicians and composers, but rather at the replacement of drama with spectacle.

==Namby Pamby and anti-Walpolean satire==

His poem, &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; (1725), satirized Ambrose Philips, a frequent and famous target of Alexander Pope&#x27;s wrath. Philips had written a series of odes to &quot;all persons&quot;, from Robert Walpole to the mother in the nursery, and the latter provided the occasion for Carey to exaggerate. Philips had employed a 2.5&#x27; iambic line, and Carey devastatingly claimed that the half-line matched Philips&#x27;s halfwitted conception. The poem was so successful that Carey himself began to be known as &quot;Namby Pamby Carey&quot; (while Philips became known as &quot;Namby Pamby&quot;), and the poem even came to be used as children&#x27;s literature. Furthermore, the term &quot;namby pamby&quot; came into widespread usage to describe any nonsensical frippery. &quot;Sally in Our Alley&quot;, one of Carey&#x27;s songs, was also exceptionally successful, and it has been performed by many singers through to the modern era.

Carey was, after &quot;Namby Pamby&quot;, a well-known figure among those opposed to Robert Walpole, and the poem had been praised by Alexander Pope (as &quot;Sally in our Alley&quot; had been by Joseph Addison). Carey was an admirer and subscriber to the operas of Handel, but, like John Gay and Alexander Pope, thought that the operatic stars were absurd. Therefore, he began to satirize opera in 1726 and in that year he produced &quot;Faustina, or, the Roman Songstress&quot;, a satire of Faustina Bordoni. Faustina was at that time in a hissing fight with Francesca Cuzzoni and actually came to blows the next year during a performance of Handel. In the next year, he wrote &quot;Mocking is Catching&quot; to satirize Senesino, the Italian castrati opera star.

In 1730, he added music and introduced ballads for his previous play, &quot;Hanging and Marriage&quot;, and put the play on as &quot;The Clown&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;. He used the basic text of the play again, with new music, for &quot;Betty, or, The Country Bumpkins&quot; in 1732. These two characteristics—a love of opera and frustration at its abuses and a love of patriotism and frustration at Walpole&#x27;s policies—would show up in all of Carey&#x27;s professional works.

In the same year, Carey may have been the first to sing &quot;God Save the King&quot; at a Patriot Whig meeting, and there is some reason to attribute the song to him. The Bath Chronicle of 13 August 1795 recounted:

The earliest published version of God Save the King (for two voices) seems to date from the early 1740s.

==Carey as dramatic satirist==

As a playwright, Carey was a significant figure in the re-emergence of satirical drama in the 1730s. After the success of &quot;Namby Pamby,&quot; Carey was favored by the older generation of Tory wits and the Scriblerus Club. After John Gay&#x27;s invention of the ballad opera with &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, Carey turned to writing musical burlesques. He wrote a great deal of music and some librettos for other playwrights during this period.

In 1732, John Frederick Lampe, Thomas Arne, John Christopher Smith and Henry Carey formed the English Opera project. Their goal was to revive serious opera in English. Together, they formed the English Opera Company, and Carey wrote two librettos, for &quot;Amelia&quot; (set by Lampe and acted at the Little Theatre at The Haymarket (an opposition playhouse favored by Henry Fielding)) and &quot;Teraminta&quot; (set by Smith and performed at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields). &quot;Amelia&quot; was a great popular success, but the opera company failed, and the project came to nought (Gillespie 128).

Having satirized the foreignness of opera, in 1734 Carey turned his attention to the poorly written, mass-produced tragedy. &quot;Chrononhotonthologos&quot; was a parody of bombastic tragedy and, particularly, the very hack-written spectacle plays he had collaborated on at Drury Lane. The play was daring, for it was a satire of Caroline of Ansbach and George II of Great Britain. The Queen was attacked for her alliance with Robert Walpole and her general caprice. It also had a generous amount of music by Carey. If contemporary allies understood the criticisms inherent in the play, it was also possible to see it as a burlesque with nonsense verse. He followed that up with the ballad farce of &quot;The Honest Yorkshire-Man.&quot;

Although Carey&#x27;s attempt to revive serious, patriotic English opera did not work, his attempts at parody and satire in opera did. He had previously satirized the exoticism and emptiness of the English public&#x27;s love of prima donna singers and castrati, but in 1737, he adapted &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot; from a Lincolnshire folk ballad into a full mock-opera. This literary adaptation was a step beyond adapting literary plays into ballads (as John Gay had done), for it began with a folk ballad and transformed it into opera. The play, with music by John Frederick Lampe, punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Robert Walpole and his taxation policies. The play was a huge success. Its initial run was sixty-nine performances in the first season, which exceeded even &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera.&quot; The play debuted at the Haymarket, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that it had all of the words sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias (Gillespie 128). The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. &quot;The Musical Entertainer&quot; from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed (Gillespie 128).

From 1737 to 1740, he wrote &quot;The Musical Century in one Hundred English Ballads&quot; in two volumes. Although Carey complained that his enemies were calling him &quot;Ballad-maker,&quot; the work was praised later by Charles Burney, and in the 19th century opinion of Carey&#x27;s clear, simple, and memorable ballad tunes went even higher. Also in 1738, he helped found the Fund for Decayed Musicians, and he produced &quot;Margery, or, a Worse Plague than the Dragon,&quot; a sequel to &quot;The Dragon of Wantley.&quot;

He had another popular success in 1739 with &quot;Nancy, or, The Parting Lovers&quot;, a patriotic play about a sailor leaving his beloved to fight against the Spanish. As with other works, Carey&#x27;s point was primarily patriotic. Patriotic plays at the time were often demurrals of official policy and England&#x27;s foreign entanglements. &quot;Nancy&quot; was set as well as written by Carey, and its main characters are a sailor, Nancy, and a Press Gang officer. The play broke new ground in explicitly treating a contemporary matter of social concern in song (Gillespie 128).

==Death==
Carey&#x27;s son, Charles, died in 1743, and Carey hanged himself at his home in London later that year. He was buried in St James Churchyard, Clerkenwell.

While the anonymous account in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; says that Carey had an annuity, he left a pregnant second wife (Sarah, whom he married between 1729 and 1733) and three dependent children, and both Hawkins and &quot;The London Stage&quot; say that he was despondent over financial difficulties. Grief over the death of his son is another possible explanation of his suicide, and Suzanne Aspden speculates that Carey suffered from paranoia, while others have suspected that he had depression or other maladies. His daughter Anne became an actress and bore an illegitimate son, Edmund Carey, who later was known as the actor Edmund Kean.

==Literary significance==
Henry Carey&#x27;s work has been tarred with allegations of triviality since his own day. He had an extraordinary gift with melody and wordplay, and later authors, such as Edward Lear, would cite Carey as a predecessor for his tongue twisters and nonsense verse in &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; and &quot;Chrononhotonthologos&quot;. At the same time, Carey&#x27;s productions were noted in his own day for their political acuity and bravery (if not foolhardiness). He was willing to offend and suffer the consequences of his convictions, but he made his political statements in a diverting and apparently frivolous manner, thereby allowing his friends to respond to his politics and his enemies to dismiss his levity. In the Macaulay-dominated view of literary history of the early 20th-century, Carey was represented as a balladeer whose fundamental moroseness was proven by his shameful suicide, and his plays, now devoid of topicality, were set as broad entertainments.

Musicologists have recognized, however, the subtle gifts necessary for Carey&#x27;s music, and theater historians are beginning to recognize the context of his plays. He was the most prolific English song composer of 1715–1740, and he wrote his own lyrics to all but twelve of his two hundred and fifty songs (Gillespie 128). He was responsible for linking the vocal style of Henry Purcell to the later style of Arne by combining popular English folks song and tavern song with Italian flourishes.

<text>A green economy is an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues &quot;that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognizing global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a Just Transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive.&quot;

A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (&quot;see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital&quot;) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.

Green sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing indicators of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy. Also known as sustainability standards, these standards are special rules that guarantee the products bought do not hurt the environment and the people that make them. The number of these standards has grown recently and they can now help build a new, greener economy. They focus on economic sectors like forestry, farming, mining or fishing, among others; concentrate on environmental factors like protecting water sources and biodiversity, or reducing greenhouse gas emissions; support social protections and workers&#x27; rights; and home in on specific parts of production processes.

== Green economists and economics ==
Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the environmental movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to mainstream economics.

According to Büscher, the increasing liberalisation of politics since the 1990s has meant that biodiversity must &#x27;legitimise itself&#x27; in economic terms. Many non-governmental organisations, governments, banks, companies and so forth have started to claim the right to Define and defend biodiversity and in a distinctly neoliberal manner that subjects the concept&#x27;s social, political, and ecological dimensions to their value as determined by capitalist markets.

Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it can be regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for human-made ones such as canals). Or, it can be viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.

An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner &#x27;green economy&#x27; could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of &quot;green economics&quot;. As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (via its &quot;Green Fund&quot; initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.

The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that &quot;based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$1.05 to US$2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.&quot;

At COP26, the European Investment Bank announced a set of just transition common principles agreed upon with multilateral development banks, which also align with the Paris Agreement. The principles refer to focusing financing on the transition to net zero carbon economies, while keeping socioeconomic effects in mind, along with policy engagement and plans for inclusion and gender equality, all aiming to deliver long-term economic transformation.

The African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, New Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank are among the multilateral development banks that have vowed to uphold the principles of climate change mitigation and a Just Transition. The World Bank Group also contributed.

==Definition==
Karl Burkart defined a green economy as based on six main sectors:
* Renewable energy 
* Green buildings
* Sustainable transport
* Water management 
* Waste management
* Land management

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), representing global business, defines the green economy as &quot;an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development&quot;.

In 2012, the ICC published the &quot;Green Economy Roadmap&quot;, containing contributions from international experts consulted bi-yearly. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of &quot;green economy&quot;. It highlights the role of business in bringing solutions to global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:

* Open and competitive markets
* Metrics, accounting, and reporting
* Finance and investment
* Awareness
* Life cycle approach
* Resource efficiency and decoupling
* Employment
* Education and skills
* Governance and partnership
* Integrated policy and decision-making

==Finance and investing==
== Green growth ==
Approximately 57% of businesses responding to a survey are investing in energy efficiency, 64% in reducing and recycling trash, and 32% in new, less polluting industries and technologies. Roughly 40% of businesses made investments in energy efficiency in 2021.

==Ecological measurements==
Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. 
# 2016 - 2022 Green Score City Index is an ongoing study measuring the anthropogenic impact human activity has on nature.
# 2010 - 2018 Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI), published by consultancy Dual Citizen LLC is in its 6th edition. It measures the green economic performance and perceptions of it in 130 countries along four main dimensions of leadership &amp; climate change, efficiency sectors, markets &amp; investment and the environment.
# 2009 - 2013 Circles of Sustainability project scored 5 cities in 5 separate countries.
# 2009 - 2012 Green City Index A global study commissioned by Siemens

Ecological footprint measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.

== Green energy issues ==

Green economies require a transition to green energy generation based on renewable energy to replace fossil fuels as well as energy conservation and efficient energy use. Renewables, like solar energy and wind energy, may eliminate the use of fossil fuels for electricity by 2035 and replace fossil fuel usage altogether by 2050.

The market failure to respond to environmental protection and climate protection needs can be attributed to high external costs and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of green energy sources and green products. The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives. However, other experts argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.

In the United States, it seemed as though the nuclear industry was coming to an end by the mid-1990s. Until 2013, there had been no new nuclear power facilities built since 1977. One reason was due to the economic reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources. Additionally, there was a public fear of nuclear energy due to the Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster. The Bush administration passed the 2005 Energy Bill that granted the nuclear industry around 10 million dollars to encourage research and development efforts. With the increasing threat of climate change, nuclear energy has been highlighted as an option to work to decarbonize the atmosphere and reverse climate change. Nuclear power forces environmentalists and citizens around the world to weigh the pro and cons of using nuclear power as a renewable energy source. The controversial nature of nuclear power has the potential to split the green economy movement into two branches— anti-nuclear and pro-nuclear.

According to a European climate survey, 63% of EU residents, 59% of Britons, 50% of Americans and 60% of Chinese respondents are in favor of switching to renewable energy. As of 2021, 18% of Americans are in favor of natural gas as a source of energy. For Britons and EU citizens nuclear energy is a more popular energy alternative.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, Eastern European and Central Asian businesses fall behind their Southern European counterparts in terms of the average quality of their green management practices, notably in terms of specified energy consumption and emissions objectives.

External variables, such as consumer pressure and energy taxes, are more relevant than firm-level features, such as size and age, in influencing the quality of green management practices. Firms with less financial limitations and stronger green management practices are more likely to invest in a bigger variety of green initiatives. Energy efficiency investments are good to both the bottom line and the environment.

The shift to greener energy and the adoption of more climate regulations are expected to have a 30% positive impact on businesses, mostly through new business prospects, and a 30% negative impact, according to businesses that took part in a survey in 2022. A little over 40% of the same businesses do not anticipate the transition to greener alternatives to alter their operations.

== Criticism ==

A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the &#x27;Green Economy&#x27;, particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP&#x27;s report, &quot;Towards a Green Economy&quot;, while well-intentioned &quot;ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.&quot;

Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and &quot;green growth&quot; in particular, &quot;based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate
change&quot; and &quot;may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions. Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses, and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis. He has also criticised the UN&#x27;s project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB), and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.

<text>Armadillidium () is a genus of the small terrestrial crustacean known as the woodlouse. &quot;Armadillidium&quot; are also commonly known as pill woodlice, leg pebbles, pill bugs, roly-poly, or potato bugs, and are often confused with pill millipedes such as &quot;Glomeris marginata&quot;. They are characterised by their ability to roll into a ball (&quot;volvation&quot;) when disturbed.

==Distribution and habitat==
They chiefly feed on decaying organic matter like leaves, decomposed wood fibers, and less so on other organic material like lichens. They are usually found in moist areas such as decomposing leaf matter and soil. &quot;Armadillidium vulgare&quot; is the most abundant species in Europe and has been introduced worldwide. However, the vast majority of species are endemic to small regions close to the Mediterranean Sea, in much lower numbers than common species such as &quot;A. vulgare&quot;, and hence are understudied.

==Description==
Unlike other terrestrial arthropods such as insects and spiders, pill bugs do not have a waxy cuticle that would reduce evaporation from their bodies. Pill bugs also use modified lungs, called pseudotrachea, for respiration, and the lungs must remain moist to function. Individual pill bugs typically live for two or three years, and females brood eggs once or twice each summer. In larger species and individuals, up to over an hundred eggs are brooded at a time in the marsupium, a pocket on the ventral side of the female pill bug. The marsupium provides nutrients and oxygen to the eggs until the hatch, resulting in a sort of “live birth”.

The colouration especially of young &quot;A. klugii&quot; resembles the red hourglass marking of the Mediterranean black widow &quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot;. This is probably a kind of mimicry, to ward off predators that mistake the harmless animal for a venomous spider.

In April, 1945 at the age of 33, Jamal succeeded his father. In August 1947, the British withdrew from the Indian subcontinent, partitioning their possessions between India and Pakistan and leaving the princely states independent. Jamal visited Kashmir in the hope of persuading Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, to accede his state to the new Dominion of Pakistan. In October 1947, Jamal acceded his own state of Hunza to Pakistan. He joined in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 over Jammu and Kashmir and was rewarded with the title of &quot;Ghazi-e-Millat&quot;.

In 1951, Aga Khan IV formed 64 local councils in the Northern Areas of Pakistan, and appointed Jamal as President of his Supreme Council for Hunza and Chitral and also as his Personal Representative in Central Asia.

In 1962, for his help to the Italian mountaineering expedition to K-2, Italy awarded Jamal its Order of the Grand Officer.

In October 1969, Jamal was invited to Paris to attend the marriage of the Aga Khan with Begum Salimah. After the ceremony, he and his wife showered 49 pearls at their feet as an act of reverence.

The President of Pakistan also gave Jamal the titles of Hilal-e-Pakistan and Hilal-e-Juraet, and in December, 1964, he was promoted to the rank of honorary Major General in the Pakistani Army.

The Mir&#x27;s rule in Hunza came to an end in 1974 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, abolished his government and annexed the state to the Northern Areas of Pakistan, under the federal government. Jamal was forced to abdicate, and two years later he died at his residence in Karimabad, the former capital.

==Personal life==
In 1934 Jamal married Shams-un-Nehar, a princess of the state of Nagar, and they had two sons and three daughters, including Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan.

<text>Elizabeth Carter (pen name Eliza; 16 December 1717 – 19 February 1806) was an English poet, classicist, writer, translator, and linguist. As one of the Bluestocking Circle that surrounded Elizabeth Montagu, she earned respect for the first English translation of the 2nd-century &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot;. She also published poems and translated from French and Italian, and corresponded profusely. Among her many eminent friends were Elizabeth Montagu, Hannah More, Hester Chapone and other Bluestocking members. Also close friends were Anne Hunter, a poet and socialite, and Mary Delany. She befriended Samuel Johnson, editing some editions of his periodical &quot;The Rambler&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Deal, Kent, on 16 December 1717, Elizabeth Carter was the eldest child of Rev. Nicolas Carter, perpetual curate of Deal, and his first wife, Margaret (died c. 1728), who was the only daughter and heir of John Swayne of Bere Regis, Dorset. She died when Elizabeth was ten. Her redbrick family home still stands at the junction of South Street and Middle Street, close to the seafront.

Nicolas Carter himself undertook the labour of educating his numerous children in the Latin and Greek languages. His eldest daughter was so slow to understand her lessons that he almost despaired of ever making her a scholar, and would have given up but for her resolute perseverance as a child, in which she struggled incessantly against all obstacles. From an early age, her ambition was to be good and learned, and she steadfastly pursued that goal through life. She could never acquire grammar as a rudimentary theory, but having attained great proficiency in the Greek and Latin languages – being especially proficient in Greek – she deduced the principles from the literature. Her father also taught her Hebrew. To assist her in acquiring French, her father sent her to board for a year with the family of M. Le Seur, a refugee minister in Canterbury, where she learnt to understand it and speak it fluently. She later applied herself to Italian, Spanish, German and Portuguese, and very late in life, learnt enough Arabic to read it without a dictionary.

Being naturally heavy, and resolved to stay awake as long as possible in pursuit of her studies, she had recourse to use snuff, and never broke herself of the habit. Over-application to her studies and lack of sleep brought on intense headaches, to which she remained subject through life. Her taste for literature came from the finest models available, and her refined manner and habits from an early introduction to high society.

She carefully studied astronomy and the geography of ancient history. She learnt to play the spinnet and the German flute and was fond of dancing in her youth. She drew tolerably well, was acquainted with household economy, loved gardening and growing flowers, and occupied her leisure or social hours with needlework. In the hope of counteracting the bad effects of too much study, she habitually took long walks and attended social parties.

===Friendships===
Elizabeth Robinson, born in 1720, was the eldest daughter of Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby, who had married the heiress of the Drakes of Horton, near Hythe. She spent much of her childhood there and was early attracted by sympathy of feeling and similarity of pursuits to a contemporary neighbour, Elizabeth Carter. A close friendship formed, which lasted to the end of their long lives. In 1742, Robinson married Edward Montagu, grandson of the second Earl Of Sandwich; subsequently Carter often visited her at her country seat at Sandleford and her house in London.

In 1741 she became acquainted with Catherine Talbot and developed a close friendship, as they appreciated each other&#x27;s faculties, virtues and piety. Through Talbot and her mother, she made contact with Thomas Secker, with whom they resided. He was then Bishop of Oxford and became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1758.

==Career==

Carter&#x27;s earliest attempts at literary composition were in verse. Her father was friendly with Edward Cave, a publisher, in whose fourth volume of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; she published several pieces under the pseudonym Eliza, when she was only 16 years old. Visiting London occasionally with her father, she was introduced by Cave to many literary persons, among them Dr Johnson, soon after his first settlement there in the year 1737. In 1738, she published an anonymous collection of her poems, including those previously printed in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In the same year, her father had conversations with Carter about marriage, and again a few years later, but she remained single, wishing to stay independent. She adopted the matronly designation &quot;Mrs.&quot; after the manner of an earlier generation. Carter rendered into English De Crousaz&#x27;s &quot;Examen de l&#x27;essai de Monsieur Pope sur l&#x27;homme&quot; (&quot;Examination of Mr Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;&quot;, two volumes, 1739) and Algarotti&#x27;s &quot;Newtonianismo per le dame&quot; (&quot;Newtonianism for women&quot;).

Early in the year 1749, she began translating &quot;All the Works of Epictetus, Which are Now Extant&quot;, submitting it sheet by sheet for Secker&#x27;s revising. She finished the &quot;Discourses&quot; in December 1752, but at his suggestion added the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; and &quot;Fragments&quot;, with an introduction and notes. Subscriptions obtained by him and from her other wealthy and influential friends allowed the work to be published in 1758. Her position in the pantheon of 18th-century women writers was ensured by her translation of Epictetus, the first English translation of the known works by the Greek Stoic philosopher, which brought her a clear profit of £1,000. The translation passed through three editions and retained a high reputation in standard literature. While occupied with bringing the first edition for the press, she was also preparing her youngest brother for the University of Cambridge.

Carter befriended Samuel Johnson, editing some issues of &quot;The Rambler&quot; in the 1750s. He wrote, &quot;My old friend Mrs. Carter could make a pudding as well as translate Epictetus from the Greek...&quot;

===Style and themes===
Carter&#x27;s sound and comprehensive mind, cultured as it was, could produce nothing bad, but it lacked the qualifications of the true poet: active originality, power of conception, and of shaping of new concepts. Her poems demonstrated regularity of numbers and a well-graduated succession of thoughts.

Carter&#x27;s biographer published a broad selection of her thirty-year correspondence with Talbot, and her correspondence with Mrs Agmondesham Vesey in the period 1763–1787 in two quarto volumes. Carter&#x27;s letters were noted for correct, perspicuous and appropriate language, soundness of judgment, moderation of spirit, deep sincerity and pervading piety. Her cheerfulness was clear from her sentiments and opinions and in occasional expressions of buoyant gaiety, in which there was always something awkward, forced, and exaggerated.

Carter kept an interest in religious matters. She was influenced by Hester Chapone and wrote apologia of the Christian faith, asserting the authority of the Bible over human matters. One such, &quot;Objections against the New Testament with Mrs Carter&#x27;s Answers to them&quot;, appeared in the compilation of &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Mrs Elizabeth Carter&quot; by Montagu Pennington, which included her &quot;Notes on the Bible and the Answers to Objections concerning the Christian Religion&quot;. Her deep belief in God also appears in her poems &quot;In Diem Natalem&quot; and &quot;Thoughts at Midnight&quot; (also known as &quot;A Night Piece&quot;).

At the suggestion of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, who took delight in her conversation and writings, Carter published another volume of poems in 1762, to which George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton contributed a poetical introduction.

In August 1768, her friend Archbishop Secker died, as did her friend Miss Sutton in November 1769 and her best friend Catherine Talbot in 1770. In the same year, Carter edited and published a volume of Talbot&#x27;s papers entitled &quot;Reflections on the Seven Days of the Week&quot;, and subsequently two volumes of her &quot;Essays and Poems&quot;.

===&quot;Nine Living Muses&quot;===

Carter appeared in the engraved (1777) and painted (1778) versions of Richard Samuel&#x27;s &quot;The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain&quot; (1779), but the figures were so idealised that she complained she could not identify herself or anyone else in the work. Samuel had not done any sittings from life when preparing for it. Fanny Burney is quoted in Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; as saying in 1780 she thought Carter &quot;a really noble-looking woman; I never saw age so graceful in the female sex yet; her whole face seems to beam with goodness, piety, and philanthropy.&quot; However, Betsy Sheridan, sister of the playwright, described her five years later in her diary as &quot;rather fat and not very striking in appearance&quot;.

===Reception===
Carter&#x27;s difficulties were all confined to her books of private study; she met with no discouragements from the outer world. Her translations were approved and her verses applauded by Burke, Dr Johnson, Savage, and Baratier, and she found herself courted by many members of learned society. In 1782, at the desire of a friend, Sir W. J. Pulteney, she accompanied his daughter to Paris, but returned home in 16 days and confined her later journeys to British soil. She was repeatedly honoured at Deal with visits from various members of the royal family. The Queen, long accustomed to ask her opinion upon books via ladies of the court, in 1791 commanded her attendance at Cremorne House, where as translator of Epictetus she was formally presented and received with the highest favour.

==Personal life and other activities==
In 1763, Carter accompanied the Earl of Bath and Edward and Elizabeth Montagu on a continental tour. They crossed the Channel to Calais, visited the Spa, passed down the Rhine, and, travelling through Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, and Dunkirk to Calais, re-crossed to Dover, after an absence of nearly four months. In the summer of 1764, Lord Bath died; and as he made no mention of Elizabeth Carter in his will, the ultimate heir to his property, Sir William Johnson Pulteney, spontaneously settled upon her an annuity of £100, which he soon afterwards increased to £150.

Her father having lost his second wife, and his other children being settled in homes of their own, Carter bought a house at Deal in 1762. Her father rented part of it, while she managed the household. They had their separate libraries and spent their study hours apart, meeting at meals and spending evenings together during periods of six months. The other half of the year she usually passed in London, or visiting friends at their country houses.

After her father&#x27;s death in 1774, a small inheritance fell to her. In 1775, Edward Montagu died and his wife Elizabeth inherited a large property. Among her first acts was to bequeath an annuity of £100 to Carter. Mrs Underwood, a family connection of the Carters, afterwards bequeathed to Carter an annuity of £40, and Mrs Talbot dying in 1783, left her a legacy of £200. Thus her literary fame eventually acquired her an unexpectedly secure income for her wants and needs.

Carter belonged to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, also known as the Abolition Society or Anti-Slavery Society.

==Later years and death==
In 1796, Carter had a dangerous illness, from which she never thoroughly recovered. She continued, however, to exert herself in visiting the poor and in establishing and maintaining charitable institutions. In 1800, her faithful friend Mrs Montagu died at the age of 80. Their correspondence of 1755–1799 was published after Mrs Carter&#x27;s death by her nephew, Mr Pennington.

Like her bluestocking contemporaries, Carter lived a long life. Increasing deafness reduced her conversational abilities. On 19 February 1806, after a long period of increasing weakness, Carter died at her lodgings in Clarges Street, London.

==Influence and legacy==
The novelist Samuel Richardson included Carter&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode to Wisdom&quot; in the text of his novel &quot;Clarissa&quot; (1747–1848), but without ascribing it to her. It was later published in a corrected form in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and Carter received an apology from Richardson.

Elizabeth Gaskell, the 19th-century novelist, refers to Carter as an epistolatory model, bracketing her in &quot;Cranford&quot; with Hester Chapone, a self-taught Bluestocking. Virginia Woolf saw her as a feminist precursor – urging &quot;homage to the robust shade of Eliza Carter – the valiant old woman who tied a bell to her bedstead in order that she might wake early and learn Greek.&quot;

<text>Fenestella (c. 52 BC – c. AD 19) was a Roman historian and encyclopaedic writer.

==Biography==
He flourished in the reign of Tiberius. According to Jerome, he lived from 52 BC to AD 19 (according to others 35 BC – AD 36).

==Work==
Taking Varro for his model, Fenestella was one of the chief representatives of the new style of historical writing which, in the place of the brilliant descriptive pictures of Livy, discussed curious and out-of-the-way incidents and customs of political and social life, including literary history. He was the author of a work entitled &quot;Annales&quot;, probably from the earliest times down to his own days.

The fragments indicate the great variety of subjects discussed: the origin of the appeal to the people (&quot;provocatio&quot;); the use of elephants in the circus games; the wearing of gold rings; the introduction of the olive tree; the material for making the toga; the cultivation of the soil; certain details as to the lives of Cicero and Terence.

The work was referred to (mention is made of an abridged edition) by Pliny the Elder, Asconius Pedianus (the commentator on Cicero), Nonius and the philologists. Fragments of his work can be found in Hermann Peter&#x27;s &quot;Historicorum Romanorum fragmenta&quot; (1883).

A work published under the name of L. Fenestella (&quot;De magistratibus et sacerdotiis Romanorum&quot;, 1510) is really by A. D. Fiocchi, canon and papal secretary, and was subsequently published as by him (under the Latinized form of his name, Floccus), edited by Aegidius Witsius (1561).

<text>Captain Frederick Chamier (2 November 1796 – 29 October 1870) was an English novelist, autobiographer and naval captain born in London. He was the author of several nautical novels that remained popular through the 19th century.

==Life==
Chamier was the son of an Anglo-Indian official, John Ezechial Chamier and his wife Georgiana, daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir William Burnaby. The family home was in Grosvenor Place, London.

He entered the Royal Navy in June 1809, joining the frigate as a midshipman in time for the Walcheren Campaign. 

After the campaign the &quot;Salsette&quot; was ordered to the Mediterranean and while at Smyrna on 11 April 1810 met with Lord Byron who on hearing the ship was making for Constantinople asked Captain Bathurst for a lift. Byron took a friendly interest in the young Chamier and when the ship stopped en-route at Tenedos within sight of the plains of Troy prevailed on the captain to allow the boy ashore to carry his fowling piece. There Byron sat down on the tomb of Patroclus, and pulled out his copy of Homer and read for his companions. Chamier would become a lifelong devotee, and sprinkle his own books in the future with many Byronic quotations. Later in May 1810, Chamier watched Byron on his famous swim across the Hellespont from Europe to Asia at the second attempt. He described the episode in his autobiography. Once in Constantinople the young midshipman accompanied his captain to various receptions and audiences for Sir Robert Adair with the sultan Mahmud II.

Bathurst was promoted in November 1810 to command the 74-gun and took Chamier with him. Later by April 1811 Chamier went on to serve in the mediterranean on the fighting the slave trade. This was followed from October 1811 to 1814 on board the under Sir Peter Parker. He was onshore with Parker when the latter was killed at Bellair on 30 August 1814.

On 6 July 1815 he was promoted lieutenant, and continued service in the Mediterranean, the home station, and the West Indies. From 20 September 1824 to 3 August 1825 he was first lieutenant on the .

He was on the West Indies station until 9 August 1826, when he was put briefly in command of the 10-gun brig for bringing her home to England in 1827, but thereafter was very soon paid off.

Chamier took no further employment and in 1833 was placed on the retired list of the navy, on which he was formally promoted captain on 1 April 1856. 

Effectively retired in 1827, he settled down to the life of an Essex county squire, further dividing his time between his house in Halkin Street, Belgravia, and Paris. His autobiography, &quot;The Life of a Sailor&quot;, was serialised in &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot; in 1831–1832). 

In 1831 he was engaged in editing the translated transcript of Mikhail Zagoskin&#x27;s novel &quot;Dmitrich Miloslawsky&quot; to be issued in England as &quot;The Young Muscovite; or, The Poles in Russia&quot;, which apparently dated from 1824. The translation had been provided from Moscow by a Russian lady of rank and her two daughters. The book&#x27;s publication was ceaselessly reported as imminent throughout 1831 and in early 1834. It was intended to publish in three parts, but it was not to appear on London bookshelves until March 1834, and when it did, it was found to have been extensively adapted to acclaim by Chamier.

At the tail end of 1831 Chamier lost a considerable sum in a failed venture the premature establishment of &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot;, his friend Frederick Marryat would make something of it, later that year. Licking his wounds in Paris he met his future wife Bessie Soane in January 1831. The couple wished to marry but Bessie&#x27;s guardian Sir John Soane refused permission, despite Chamier, on the face of it, being a man of means; his father had left him a legacy of £10,000 and his writing at that stage was earning him £300 a year. The couple clandestinely eloped to Gretna Green. The couple remarried in Esher that April in an unsuccessful bid to placate the family, to no result, and went off to live in Paris From October 1832 till August 1834. Their only child Elizabeth was born there in the January. 

He also wrote nautical novels somewhat in the style of Marryat, including &quot;The Unfortunate Man&quot; (1835), &quot;Ben Brace, the Last of Nelson&#x27;s Agamemnons&quot; (1836), &quot;The Arethusa&quot; (1837), &quot;Jack Adams, the Mutineer&quot; (1838), &quot;The Spitfire&quot; (1840), &quot;Tom Bowling&quot; (1841), a trilogy &quot;Count Konigsmark&quot; (1845) and &quot;Jack Malcolm&#x27;s Log&quot; (1846). In addition, he continued William James&#x27;s &quot;Naval History&quot; and wrote some books of travel. 

Chamier invested heavily in the railways. In 1845 alone was a director of several companies, notably the &quot;Fampoux and Hazebrouck&quot;, the &quot;Paris and Lyon&quot;, the &quot;Cambridge and Lincoln Extension&quot;, the ruinous &quot;Northampton and Cambridge&quot;, and the &quot;Rugby and Worcester&quot;.

He had been in Paris during the revolution of February 1848, and published an account of that period under the title &quot;A Review of the French Revolution of 1848&quot;, in which he depicted the main personages taking part in the events. 

Chamier held for some time an official post abroad, but retired to Warrior Square, St Leonards-on-Sea, where he died on 29 October 1870 after a lingering illness, survived by his wife. The couple are buried in Hastings Cemetery. He had married in 1832 Elizabeth, daughter of the late John Soane, of Chelsea, and granddaughter of the celebrated Sir John Soane.. His wife, Elizabeth died in 1879. The couple&#x27;s only child, Eliza Maria Chamier, first married Captain Frederick Crewe, and on his death married Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe.

Frederick Chamier laid claim to being descended from the 17th-century French Huguenot politician Daniel Chamier.

==Reception==
Chamier&#x27;s most popular books were:
*&quot;Life of a Sailor&quot;, reprinted six times between 1832 and 1873
*&quot;Ben Brace&quot;, reprinted eleven times between 1836 and 1905
*&quot;Tom Bowling&quot;, reprinted five times between 1858 and 1905
*&quot;The Spitfire&quot;, reprinted three times between 1840 and 1861

In 1870 &quot;The Times&quot; described Chamier as &quot;a veteran novelist, one, indeed, whose sea novels some quarter of a century ago were almost as universally popular as those of Captain Marryat.&quot; Captain Chamier&#x27;s works were popular on the Continent; some appeared in two or three translations.

<doc id="996718" wikidata="Q1796535" url="?curid=996718" title="Hester Chapone">
<text>Hester Chapone &quot;née&quot; Mulso (27 October 1727, in Twywell, Northamptonshire – 25 December 1801, in Hadwell, Middlesex), was an English writer of conduct books for women. She became associated with the London Bluestockings.

==Life==
Hester, the daughter of Thomas Mulso (1695–1763), a gentleman farmer, and his wife (died 1747/1748), a daughter of Colonel Thomas, wrote a romance at the age of nine entitled &quot;The Loves of Amoret and Melissa&quot;, which earned her mother&#x27;s disapproval. She was educated more thoroughly than most girls in that period, learning French, Italian and Latin, and began writing regularly and corresponding with other writers at the age of 18.

Her earliest published works were four brief pieces for Samuel Johnson&#x27;s journal &quot;The Rambler&quot; in 1750. She was married in 1760 to the solicitor John Chapone (c. 1728–1761), the son of an earlier moral writer, Sarah Chapone (1699–1764), but she was soon widowed. Hester Chapone became associated with the learned ladies or Bluestockings who gathered around Elizabeth Montagu and wrote &quot;Letters on the Improvement of the Mind&quot; and &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. She died at Monken Hadley, Middlesex, on 25 December 1801.

==Conduct books==
The &quot;Letters...&quot; were written initially for Chapone&#x27;s 15-year-old niece in 1773, but by 1800 had been through at least 16 editions. A further 12 editions had appeared by 1829, at least one of them a French translation. They focused on encouraging rational understanding through the reading of the Bible, history and literature. The niece was also urged to study book-keeping, household management, botany, geology and astronomy. Only sentimental novels were to be avoided. Mary Wollstonecraft singled the book out as one of few examples of the self-improvement genre that deserved praise.

The tide of advice or conduct books in Britain reached its height between 1760 and 1820; one scholar calls the period &quot;the age of courtesy books for women&quot;. As Nancy Armstrong writes in her &quot;Desire and Domestic Fiction&quot; (1987): &quot;So popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed.&quot; Chapone&#x27;s is a typical example.

Conduct books picked up the styles and rhetoric of earlier genres such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books and works on household economy. They offered a description most often of the ideal woman, while handing out practical advice. Not only did they dictate morality, but they guided readers&#x27; choice of dress and outlined what was seen in the period as proper etiquette. Chapone&#x27;s work in particular influenced Wollstonecraft in her composition of &quot;Thoughts&quot;, for its &quot;sustained programme of study for women&quot; and basis on the idea that Christianity should be &quot;the chief instructor of our rational faculties&quot;. and on its emphasis that women should be seen as rational beings and not left to wallow in &quot;sensualism&quot;. Wollstonecraft drew on both Chapone and Macaulay&#x27;s works when she wrote &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; in 1792. Another admirer, and also a personal friend, was the novelist and diarist Frances Burney. Their surviving correspondence includes a letter of condolence of 4 April 1799 from Burney to Chapone, on the death in childbirth of Jane Jeffreyes, née Mulso, the niece to whom the &quot;Letters on the Improvement of the Mind&quot; had been addressed.

The 19th-century novelist Elizabeth Gaskell refers to Chapone as an epistolatory model, bracketing her in &quot;Cranford&quot; with Elizabeth Carter, a much better educated Bluestocking. The book also appears in Anne Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; through one of the characters, and had an influence on Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen and Mary Wollstonecraft.

In Chapter 1 of Vanity Fair, Thackeray sums up the self-image of Miss Pinkerton, proprietor of an &quot;academy for young ladies&quot;, by describing her as &quot;that majestic lady; the Semiramis of Hammersmith, the friend of Doctor Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself&quot;; later in the same chapter Miss Pinkerton notes that her establishment, The Mall, enjoyed &quot;the patronage of the admirable Mrs Chapone&quot;.

Richardson and Elizabeth Carter edited a compilation of Chapone&#x27;s writings entitled &quot;The Posthumous Works of Mrs. Chapone: Containing Her Correspondence with Mr. Richardson; a Series of Letters to Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, and Some Fugitive Pieces, Never Before Published. Together with an Account of Her Life and Character, Drawn Up by Her Own Family&quot; (1807). There, Chapone is quoted: &quot;Though men&#x27;s ways are unequal, the ways of God are equal, and with him &quot;even women&quot; shall find justice.&quot;

<text>Walter Charleton (2 February 1619 – 24 April 1707) was a natural philosopher and English writer.

According to Jon Parkin, he was &quot;the main conduit for the transmission of Epicurean ideas to England&quot;.

==Life==
He was the son of the rector of Shepton Mallet in Somerset, where he was born 2 February 1619. He received his early education from his father, and when sixteen entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, under the tuition of John Wilkins. At the early age of 22 (1641) he received the degree of M.D. and in the same year was appointed physician to Charles I, who was then at Oxford. In 1650 Charleton settled in London, and was on 8 April admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians. A royalist, he was appointed physician to the exiled king Charles II but remained in London writing, in Russell Street, Covent Garden.

He was continued in his office of physician at the Restoration, and was one of the first elected fellows of the Royal Society in 1663; on 23 January 1676 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He gave the first lectures delivered in the Cutlerian Theatre in Warwick Lane, in 1680 delivered the Harveian oration, and was president in 1689 and 1691. After his last year of presidency at the College of Physicians, Charleton left London and a dwindling medical practice. He retired to Nantwich; but returned to London, and was senior censor in the College of Physicians from 1698 to 1706, and delivered Harveian orations in 1680, 1702 and 1706, when he was also appointed Harveian librarian. He died 24 April 1707.

He had in early life read much in Van Helmont, and spent time in reading and composition, rather than with patients. Thomas Hobbes, Lord Dorchester, Sir Francis Prujean and George Ent were his friends.

==Work==
He was a copious writer also on theology, natural history, and antiquities, and published &quot;Chorea Gigantum&quot; (1663) to prove that Stonehenge was built by the Danes. Charleton claimed it was used by them as a place of assembly, and of the inauguration of kings. The only argument is that similar stone works exist in Denmark, a fact supplied to Charleton by the Danish antiquary, Wormius, with whom he had corresponded on the book of Inigo Jones in which Stonehenge is said to be a Roman temple. The &quot;Chorea Gigantum&quot; had a poem by John Dryden written in its praise, the &quot;Epistle to Dr. Charleton&quot;, prefixed to the presentation copy given to the king.

He was one of the &quot;character&quot; writers, and in this kind of literature wrote an essay &quot;A Brief Discourse concerning the Different Wits of Men&quot; (1675).

<text>Porocytes are tubular cells which make up the pores of a sponge known as ostia.

==Description==
Covering the sponge is a layer of cells known as the pinacoderm, which is composed of pinacocytes. In a sponge, pinacocytes are a thin, elastic layer which keeps water out. Between the pinacocytes, there are the porocytes that allow water into the sponge. Myocytes are small muscular cells that open and close the porocytes. They also form a circular ring around the osculum and help in closing and opening of it. Once through the pores, water travels down canals. The opening to a porocyte is a pore known as an ostium.

In sponges, like Scypha, there are some cells that have an intracellular pore. These cells are known as porocytes. They are present in the Leucosolenia (an asconoid sponge) in the body wall through which water enters the body or they are present in Scypha (a syconoid sponge) as a connection between incurrent canal and radial canal. The pore is called an ostia in asconoid type sponges as it serves as the connection between the outside of the body and the spongocoel but called a prosopyle in syconoid sponges. They are modified pinacocytes.

<text>Andrew Cherry (11 January 1762 – 12 February 1812) was an Irish dramatist, songwriter, actor and theatre manager.

==Life==
He was born in Limerick on 11 January 1762. 
His father, John Cherry, a printer and bookseller in Limerick, is said to hare intended him for the church. At eleven years of age, however, Cherry left the Limerick from school and entered the employment of James Potts, a printer and bookseller in Dublin.

From an early period, he displayed a taste for the stage, and at the age of fourteen he played as an amateur, in a room at the Black-a-Moor&#x27;s Head, Towers Street, Dublin, Lucia in Addison&#x27;s &quot;Cato&quot;. Three years later be first appeared at Naas, county Kildare, as a member of a strolling company under the management of a Mr. Martin, playing Feignwell in &quot;A Bold Stroke for s Wife&quot;. As a strolling player in Ireland, he purchased, at the cost of constant exposure and imminent risk of starvation, a fair knowledge of his art. According to the accounts of his career published during his lifetime, he was on one occasion three days without food. Yielding to discouragement he returned to his former occupation and remained in Dublin for three years. After one or two attempts to resume his profession of an actor he joined the company of Richard William Knipe, a well-known and popular manager, whose daughter, after the death of her father, he married in Belfast. Cherry then joined the &#x27;principal provincial company of Ireland&#x27; under the management of Atkins, and played with an increasing reputation in the north of Ireland a round of leading characters. Mr. Ryder having in 1787 been engaged for Covent Garden, Mr. Cherry was called up to supply his place at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, Dublin. As Ryder&#x27;s first appearance took place on 25 October 1766, this data is seen to be not wholly trustworthy.

For five or six years Cherry, familiarly known as &#x27;Little Cherry,&#x27; enjoyed a high reputation in Dublin. His first part in the Smock Alley Theatre was Darby in the &quot;Poor Soldier&quot; of O&#x27;Keefe. Early in the season of 1791–2, he appeared with his wife in Hull as a member of the company of Tate Wilkinson, playing comic characters previously assigned to Fawcett, who had just quit the York circuit for Covent Garden. He first appeared as a member of Wilkinson&#x27;s troupe at Wakefield as Vapid in the &quot;Dramatist&quot;, and Lamrillo in Jephson&#x27;s &quot;Two Strings to your Bow&quot;. In the spring of 1794, Cherry, irritated that Fawcett, then on a starring tour, resumed his old parts, threw up his engagement with Tale Wilkinson and returned to Dublin, where he continued for two seasons, after which, with his wife, he engaged with Ward and Banks at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. Thence, to replace Blisset, he proceeded to Bath, in which city he made his first appearance on 6 October 1798.

From Bath, he made his way to Drury Lane, at which house he appeared for the first time on 25 September 1802 as Sir Benjamin Dove in the &quot;Brothers&quot; of Cumberland, and Lazarillo in &quot;Two Strings to your Bow&quot;. At this house, at which one or two of his pieces were produced, he stayed until 1807, after which his name disappeared from the bills. A few years subsequently he was managing a theatrical company in Wales.

By his wife, Cherry had a large family. He died at Monmouth in February 1812.

==Assessment==
Genest was unfavourably impressed with Cherry as an actor. 
On the other hand, Tate Wilkinson says that in certain characters &quot;he possesses great merit,&quot; and adds that he 
Among some manuscript notes to the &#x27;Account of the English Stage&#x27; by Genest believed to be by the late George Daniel, appear the following observations a propos to one of Genest&#x27;s sneers (vii. 565): 

==Works==

* &quot;Harlequin on the Stocks&quot;, pantomime, 1793, produced at the Hull Theatre for his benefit. 1793.
* &quot;The Outcasts&quot;, opera, 1796 (not printed).

<doc id="996726" wikidata="Q2247097" url="?curid=996726" title="Parabolic trajectory">
<text>In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics a parabolic trajectory is a Kepler orbit with the eccentricity equal to 1 and is an unbound orbit that is exactly on the border between elliptical and hyperbolic. When moving away from the source it is called an escape orbit, otherwise a capture orbit. It is also sometimes referred to as a C3 = 0 orbit (see Characteristic energy).

Under standard assumptions a body traveling along an escape orbit will coast along a parabolic trajectory to infinity, with velocity relative to the central body tending to zero, and therefore will never return. Parabolic trajectories are minimum-energy escape trajectories, separating positive-energy hyperbolic trajectories from negative-energy elliptic orbits.

==Velocity==
The orbital velocity (formula_1) of a body travelling along a parabolic trajectory can be computed as:
:formula_2
where:
*formula_3 is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body,
*formula_4 is the standard gravitational parameter.

At any position the orbiting body has the escape velocity for that position.

If a body has an escape velocity with respect to the Earth, this is not enough to escape the Solar System, so near the Earth the orbit resembles a parabola, but further away it bends into an elliptical orbit around the Sun.

This velocity (formula_1) is closely related to the orbital velocity of a body in a circular orbit of the radius equal to the radial position of orbiting body on the parabolic trajectory:
:formula_6
where:
*formula_7 is orbital velocity of a body in circular orbit.

==Equation of motion==
For a body moving along this kind of trajectory the orbital equation is:
:formula_8
where:
*formula_9 is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body,
*formula_10 is the specific angular momentum of the orbiting body,
*formula_11 is the true anomaly of the orbiting body,
*formula_12 is the standard gravitational parameter.

==Energy==
Under standard assumptions, the specific orbital energy (formula_13) of a parabolic trajectory is zero, so the orbital energy conservation equation for this trajectory takes the form:
:formula_14
where:
*formula_15 is the orbital velocity of the orbiting body,
*formula_9 is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body,
*formula_12 is the standard gravitational parameter.

This is entirely equivalent to the characteristic energy (square of the speed at infinity) being 0:
:formula_18

==Barker&#x27;s equation==

Barker&#x27;s equation relates the time of flight formula_19 to the true anomaly formula_20 of a parabolic trajectory:
:formula_21

where:
*formula_22 is an auxiliary variable
*formula_23 is the time of periapsis passage
*formula_4 is the standard gravitational parameter
*formula_25 is the semi-latus rectum of the trajectory (formula_26 )

More generally, the time (epoch) between any two points on an orbit is 
:formula_27

Alternately, the equation can be expressed in terms of periapsis distance, in a parabolic orbit formula_28:
:formula_29

Unlike Kepler&#x27;s equation, which is used to solve for true anomalies in elliptical and hyperbolic trajectories, the true anomaly in Barker&#x27;s equation can be solved directly for formula_19. If the following substitutions are made
:formula_31

then
: formula_32

With hyperbolic functions the solution can be also expressed as:

: formula_33

where

: formula_34

==Radial parabolic trajectory==
A radial parabolic trajectory is a non-periodic trajectory on a straight line where the relative velocity of the two objects is always the escape velocity. There are two cases: the bodies move away from each other or towards each other.

There is a rather simple expression for the position as function of time:
: formula_35

where 
* &quot;μ&quot; is the standard gravitational parameter
* formula_36 corresponds to the extrapolated time of the fictitious starting or ending at the center of the central body.

At any time the average speed from formula_36 is 1.5 times the current speed, i.e. 1.5 times the local escape velocity.

To have formula_36 at the surface, apply a time shift; for the Earth (and any other spherically symmetric body with the same average density) as central body this time shift is 6 minutes and 20 seconds; seven of these periods later the height above the surface is three times the radius, etc.

<text>Analândia is a Brazilian municipality of the state of São Paulo. The population is 5,056 (2020 est.) in an area of 326 km2. Its original given name in 1887 was Cuscuzeiro, later changing to Anápolis in 1890, and finally taking on the name of Analândia in 1944 to distinguish itself from a homonymous municipality. The originally referenced &quot;Cuscuzeiro&quot; is a 900 meters tall hill that has now become a local touristic attraction.

It was the location of the Brazilian version of The Simple Life, entitled &quot;Simple Life: Mudando de Vida&quot;.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="996736" wikidata="Q740706" url="?curid=996736" title="John Cleveland">
<text>John Cleveland (16 June 1613 – 29 April 1658) was an English poet who supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. He was best known for political satire.

==Early life==
Cleveland was born in Loughborough, the son of Thomas Cleveland, Vicar of Hinckley (1620–1652), and educated at Hinckley Grammar School. Admitted to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, he graduated BA in 1632 and became a fellow of St John&#x27;s College in 1634, where he became a college tutor and lecturer in rhetoric.

==Posts==
A staunch Royalist, Cleveland opposed the election of Oliver Cromwell as member for Cambridge in the Long Parliament and lost his college post as a result in 1645. He then joined Charles I, by whom he was welcomed, and appointed to the office of judge advocate at Newark-on-Trent.

In 1646, however, he lost his judge advocacy and wandered about the country dependent on the bounty of other Royalists. In 1655 he was imprisoned at Great Yarmouth, but released by Cromwell, to whom he appealed, and went to London, where he spent the rest of his life. For his letter to Cromwell, see &quot;May it please yr Highnesse&quot; (1657) or &quot;Cleaveland&#x27;s petition to His Highnesse the Lord Protector&quot; [sic].

==Poems and other works==
Cleveland&#x27;s poems first appeared in &quot;The Character of a London Diurnal&quot; (1647) and thereafter in some 20 other collections. His achievement lay in political, satirical verses written mainly in heroic couplets. He has been called &quot;both a detached, intellectual, &#x27;metaphysical&#x27; poet&quot; and &quot;a committed satirist&quot;.

Cleveland also wrote Royalist news books such as &quot;Mercurius Pragmaticus&quot; for King Charles II, which appeared after the execution of Charles I. He was particularly interested in the 14th-century Wat Tyler rebellion against Richard II.

His own volume of &quot;Poems&quot; was published in 1654.

<text>Angatuba is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo. The population is 25,479 (2020 est.) in an area of 1028 km². The highway Rodovia Raposo Tavares passes south of the city.
There is controversy about the meaning of the name &quot;Angatuba&quot;. It is a Tupi-Guarani word for &quot;house of spirits&quot; or &quot;sweet fruit&quot;. Angatuba was founded in 1872, under the name &quot;Espírito Santo da Boa Vista&quot;. It became a town (&quot;vila&quot;) and an independent municipality in 1885, when it was separated from Itapetininga. It was elevated to a city (&quot;cidade&quot;) in 1906. The name was changed to &quot;Angatuba&quot; in 1908. In 1991 Campina do Monte Alegre was separated from Angatuba.

==Geography==
The municipality contains the Angatuba Ecological Station, a fully protected conservation unit created in 1985.
The ecological station is contained within the Angatuba State Forest.
This is a sustainable use conservation unit created in 1965.

<doc id="996739" wikidata="Q466162" url="?curid=996739" title="Frances Power Cobbe">
<text>Frances Power Cobbe (4 December 1822 – 5 April 1904) was an Anglo-Irish writer, philosopher, religious thinker, social reformer, anti-vivisection activist and leading women&#x27;s suffrage campaigner. She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) in 1875 and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage.

==Life==
Frances Power Cobbe was a member of the prominent Cobbe family, descended from Archbishop Charles Cobbe, Primate of Ireland. She was born in Newbridge House in the family estate in present-day Donabate, County Dublin.

Cobbe was educated mainly at home by governesses with a brief period at a school in Brighton. She studied English literature, French, German, Italian, music, and the Bible. She then read heavily in the family library especially in religion and theology, joined several subscription libraries, and studied Greek and geometry with a local clergyman. She organised her own study schedule and ended up very well educated.

In the late 1830s Cobbe went through a crisis of faith. The humane theology of Theodore Parker, an American transcendentalist and abolitionist, restored her faith (she went on later to edit Parker&#x27;s collected writings). She began to set out her ideas in what became an &quot;Essay on True Religion&quot;. Her father disapproved and for a while expelled her from the home. She kept studying and writing anyway and eventually revised the Essay into her first book, the &quot;Essay on Intuitive Morals&quot;. The first volume came out anonymously in 1855.

In 1857 Cobbe&#x27;s father died and left her an annuity. She took the chance to travel on her own around parts of Europe and the Near East. This took her to Italy where she met a community of similarly independent women: Isa Blagden with whom she went on briefly to share a house, the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the painter Rosa Bonheur, the scientist Mary Somerville and the Welsh sculptor who became her partner, Mary Lloyd (sculptor). In letters and published writing, Cobbe referred to Lloyd alternately as &quot;husband,&quot; &quot;wife,&quot; and &quot;dear friend.&quot; Cobbe also formed a lasting attachment to Italy and went there regularly. She contributed many newspaper and journal articles on Italy, some of which became her 1864 book &quot;Italics&quot;.

Returning to England Cobbe tried working at the Red Lodge Reformatory and living with the owner, Mary Carpenter, from 1858 to 1859. The turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.

Cobbe now focused on writing and began to publish her first articles in Victorian periodicals. She quickly became very successful and was able to support herself by writing. She and Lloyd began to live together in London.
Cobbe kept up a steady stream of journal essays, many of them reissued as books. She became a leader writer for the London newspaper The Echo (London). Cobbe became involved in feminist campaigns for the vote, for women to be admitted to study at university on the same terms as men, and for married women&#x27;s property rights. She was on the executive council of the London National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage. Her 1878 essay &quot;Wife-Torture in England&quot; influenced the passage of the 1878 Matrimonial Causes Act, which gave women of violent husbands the right to a legal separation.

Cobbe became very concerned about the rise of animal experimentation or vivisection and founded the Victoria Street Society, which later became the National Anti-Vivisection Society, in 1875. The organisation campaigned for laws to regulate vivisection. She and her allies had already prepared a draft bill, Henniker&#x27;s Bill, presented to parliament in 1875. They proposed regular inspections of licensed premises and that experimenters must always use anaesthetics except under time-limited personal licences. In response Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Burdon Sanderson and others drafted a rival Playfair&#x27;s Bill which proposed a lighter system of regulation. Ultimately the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 introduced a compromise system. Cobbe found it so watered-down that she gave up on regulation and began to campaign for the abolition of vivisection. The anti-vivisection movement became split between the abolitionists and the moderates. Cobbe later came to think the Victoria Street Society had become too moderate and started the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in 1898.

In 1884, Cobbe and Lloyd retired to Hengwrt in Wales. Cobbe stayed there after Lloyd died in 1896. Cobbe continued to publish and campaign right until her death. However her friend, the writer Blanche Atkinson, wrote, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd&#x27;s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe. The joy of life had gone. It had been such a friendship as is rarely seen – perfect in love, sympathy, and mutual understand.” They are buried together at Saint Illtyd Church Cemetery, Llanelltyd, Gwynedd, Wales.

In her will, Cobbe bequeathed all the copyrights of her works to Atkinson .

==Thought and ideas==

In Cobbe&#x27;s first book &quot;An Essay on Intuitive Morals&quot;, vol. 1, she combined Kantian ethics, theism, and intuitionism. She had encountered Kant in the early 1850s. She argued that the key concept in ethics is duty, that duties presuppose a moral law, and a moral law presupposes an absolute moral legislator - God. She argued that we know by intuition what the law requires us to do. We can trust our intuition because it is &quot;God&#x27;s tuition&quot;. We can do what the law requires because we have noumenal selves as well as being in the world of phenomena. She rejected eudaimonism and utilitarianism.

Cobbe applied her moral theory to animal rights, first in &quot;The Rights of Man and the Claims of Brutes&quot; from 1863. She argued that humans may do harm to animals in order to satisfy real wants but not from mere &quot;wantonness&quot;. For example, humans may eat meat but not kill birds for feathers to decorate hats. The harm or pain inflicted must be the minimum possible. For Cobbe this set limits to vivisection, for example, it must always be done under anaesthetia.

Cobbe engaged with Darwinism. She had met the Darwin family in 1868. Emma Darwin liked her, saying &quot;Miss Cobbe was very agreeable.&quot; Cobbe persuaded Charles Darwin to read Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. Darwin had a review copy of &quot;Descent of Man&quot; sent to her (as well as to Alfred Russel Wallace and St. George Jackson Mivart. This led to her critique of Darwin, &quot;Darwinism in Morals&quot;, in &quot;The Theological Review&quot; in April 1871. Cobbe thought morality could not be explained by evolution and needed reference to God. Darwin could show why we do feel sympathy for others, but not why we ought to feel it. 

However, the debate with Darwin led Cobbe to revise her views about duties to animals. She started to think that sympathy was central and we must above all treat animals in ways that show sympathy for them. Vivisection violated this. She also introduced a distinction between sympathy and what she called heteropathy, similar to hostility or cruelty. She thought we naturally have cruel instincts that found an outlet in vivisection. Religion in contrast cultivated sympathy, but science was undermining it. This became part of a wide-ranging account of the direction of European civilisation.

These were just some of the huge range of philosophical topics on which Cobbe wrote. They included aesthetics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, history, pessimism, life after death, and many more. Her books included &quot;The Pursuits of Women&quot; (1863), &quot;Essays New and Old on Ethical and Social Subjects&quot; (1865), &quot;Darwinism in Morals, and other Essays&quot; (1872), &quot;The Hopes of the Human Race&quot; (1874), &quot;The Duties of Women&quot; (1881), &quot;The Peak in Darien, with some other Inquiries touching concerns of the Soul and the Body&quot; (1882), &quot;The Scientific Spirit of the Age&quot; (1888) and &quot;The Modern Rack: Papers on Vivisection&quot; (1889), as well as her autobiography.

==Legacy==

In the late nineteenth century Cobbe was very well known for her philosophical views. For example, Margaret Oliphant in &quot;The Victorian Age of English Literature&quot;, when discussing philosophy, said &quot;There are few ladies to be found among these ranks, but the name of Miss Frances Power Cobbe may be mentioned as that of a clear writer and profound thinker&quot;.

A portrait of her is included in a mural by Walter P. Starmer unveiled in 1921 in the church of St Jude-on-the-Hill in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London.

Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

Her name is listed (as F. Power Cobbe) on the Reformers’ Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

The Animal Theology professorship at the Graduate Theological Foundation is named after Cobbe.

Her philosophical contribution is now being rediscovered as part of the recovery of women in the history of philosophy.

<doc id="996745" wikidata="Q22066885" url="?curid=996745" title="Anhumas">
<text>Anhumas is a Brazilian municipality in the southern region of the state of São Paulo. Situated at 422 m above sea level, Anhumas is 500 km from the city of São Paulo. The population is 4,144 (2020 est.) in an area of 321 km².

==History==
The beginnings of the town can be traced back to 1875 when the Sorocabana Railroad opened up the region bounded by the Anhumas, Paranapanema, Peixe, and Aguapeí rivers. Initially, it was only a tiny village serving two farms which between them covered 30,000 acres. With the influx of immigrants, Anhumas had grown to 120 households by 1928 with 500 farmers working the surrounding land which was planted with 4,000,000 coffee trees. At that time, the town was under the governance of the municipality of Presidente Prudente.

Until 1938, when the first wooden house was built, all the town&#x27;s buildings were made from mudbricks, including its first chapel, which was built in 1921 and serviced by visiting priests. The town received its own parish and resident priest in 1936. The cornerstone for the parish church, dedicated to Santa Luzia, was laid in 1941. The church was completed in 1953, the same year in which Anhumas was granted status as an independent municipality. 

==Geography and demography==
Anhumas lies in the Mata Atlântica, a biome with a subtropical climate and characterised by moist broadleaf forests. The population of Anhumas had reached its height in 1950 when the town had 8,843 inhabitants. However its population fell over the ensuing years. By 1960 the population was 6,668; by 1980 it was 3,242. The estimated population in 2013 was 3,941. Its economy remains largely agriculture-based.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="996746" wikidata="Q1266974" url="?curid=996746" title="Thinning">
<text>In agricultural sciences, thinning is the removal of some plants, or parts of plants, to make room for the growth of others. Selective removal of parts of a plant such as branches, buds, or roots is typically known as pruning.

In forestry, thinning is the selective removal of trees, primarily undertaken to improve the growth rate or health of the remaining trees. Overcrowded trees are under competitive stress from their neighbors. Thinning may be done to increase the resistance of the stand to environmental stress such as drought, insect infestation, extreme temperature, or wildfire.

== In forestry ==

Tree thinning may be practised in forestry to make a stand more profitable in an upcoming final felling, or to advance ecological goals such as increasing biodiversity or accelerating the development of desired structural attributes such as large diameter trees with long tree crowns.

Early thinning, e.g. after 20 years, rather than late thinning, e.g. after 50 years, has different effects on the trees thinned. An early thinning would encourage trees to develop wider crowns, increase trunk diameter and be more stable against threats like snow breakage or windthrow. Too much thinning too early in their lifespan could cause a site to overgrow with shrubs and prevent an understory from regenerating efficiently. Alternatively, thinning an area later would mean that trees will grow tall and slender; although the trees would gain value incrementally with time, they may be less marketable as thinness reduces said value. Epicormic shooting is a risk when thinning is carried out tardily, which can lead to tree branchiness and the presence of knots in the resultant timber harvest, again reducing value.

Traditionally, thinning has been performed to create a desired balance between individual tree attributes (such as tree diameter) and area-relative attributes such as volume. It has been, and often still is, applied with the desire to create uniform stands. As a result, thinning treatments are often described in terms of number of trees per area to remain or average spacing between trees. It is also necessary when too many trees were initially planted or survived through the seedling phase. Planting less and thinning less saves money in commercial forestry; thinning is carried out in a balanced manner, dependent on site qualities as well as planting régimes.

There is no certain outcome from thinning nor standard timing for it. Individual site conditions and responses of individual or mixed species on sites may vary considerably and thus responses to thinnings likewise are inconsistent. Norway spruce on a suitable site have responded well in terms of growth increment, to late thinnings (after 50 years) whereas other species have not for example slash pine.

Due to such variability it is better to talk about a thinning régime rather than one particular method of thinning taking place in a stand.

===Thinning methods===

* &quot;Thinning from below&quot; – this low thinning can be split into 4 Grades: A Grade is a very light thinning, that removes all overtopped trees Kraft crown class 4 and 5. B Grade is a very light thinning that removes overtopped trees and intermediates which are Kraft Crown class 4,5 and some 3s, C Grade and D Grade are a moderate and heavy thinning respectively removing anything that will not lead to high quality tree crown growth. 
* &quot;Thinning from above&quot; – this crown thinning removes all of the trees that impact crown wise on other trees. Smaller trees, Kraft crown class 5 for example would just be ignored and left in the stand and not cut. It is also called the French method.
* &quot;Diameter-limit thinning&quot; this selection thinning is related to the Borggreve silvicultural system. Large trees over a certain diameter are removed for smaller trees in good condition to grow. These in turn after some growth are thinned. Eventually the stand is exhausted after several cycles and the remnant is clear cut and replanted. It is used with shade tolerant species like Western hemlock.
* &quot;Geometrical thinning&quot; – mechanical thinning like this is used in plantations where one row is taken out and the next left no matter the tree condition. A different grid might be used for natural stands sometimes called strip thinning.
* &quot;Free thinning&quot; – this is done as crop tree release and it means thinning around a wanted tree, over a stand. This may mean in some areas no thinning and in others a lot of thinning. this heterogeneity represents where the most valuable trees are.

===Ecological thinning===

A thinning in which the trees removed have little or no economic value is called a pre-commercial thinning. Ecological thinning is a variant of this being studied for use in forest conservation. The primary aim of forest thinning is to increase growth of selected trees, but ecological thinning is done to favor development of wildlife habitat (such as hollows) rather than focusing on increased timber yields. Thinning may also reduce the risk of wildfire by increasing availability of groundwater as well as reducing fuel for wildfires.

Chemical thinning is a form of non-commercial thinning in which the trees are killed while they stand by injecting a chemical such as glyphosate (Round Up) into a cut made in the stem. This reduces the number of live stems remaining, providing a benefit to those that remain and may be undertaken where the cost of a traditional thin is high. It can also be done on very exposed sites where breaking the canopy through a traditional thinning operation would expose the stand to a high risk of windthrow.

Another type of thinning is called variable density thinning. In this type of thinning, the intent is to manage various portions of the stand in different ways to create structural and spatial heterogeneity. The intent is often to increase biodiversity or wildlife habitat. In variable density thinning, some portions of the stand may not be entered. These unentered areas, sometimes called reserves, leave islands, or skips (as they are skipped over) help retain a large range of tree diameters, serve as a future source of competition-related mortality, and may preserve snags, down wood, and understory plants.

Other portions of a stand could be heavily thinned or gaps or openings could be created. These areas accelerate the growth rates of trees in the open areas or on their perimeter and help retain or develop long crowns with live branches. Another portion of the stand, sometimes referred to as the matrix, is thinned to result in residual trees densities which area in between the other extremes. Over the whole area, a wide variety of trees with different diameters and species are retained.

=== Virtual thinning in marteloscopes ===
Timber marking - selecting the trees to be cut in a forest stand by marking them - is a crucial task for a forest manager. Because of the irreversible character of cutting trees, tools were developed to virtually practice tree selection. A marteloscope is a forest site (typically a one hectare rectangular site) where all trees are numbered, mapped and recorded. This information can then be visualised through an application on a hand-held device such as a tablet.

== In agriculture ==

In agriculture and gardening, thinning is the selective removal of flowers, fruits, shoots, and seedlings or young plants to allow adequate space for the remaining organs/plants to grow efficiently. In large-scale farming, techniques like precision seeding and transplanting can eliminate the need for thinning by starting plants at their optimum spacing. On a smaller scale, such as a home vegetable garden, thinning can be used as a way to make maximum use of space for certain crops. For example, beets, carrots, green onions and others can be planted densely, and then thinned to make room for continued growth of the plants left in the soil, and also as a harvest of baby vegetables (beet greens, baby carrots, baby onions). Also thinning is used in post harvesting.

<text>Aparecida is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo. It is located in the fertile valley of the River Paraíba do Sul on the southern (right) bank. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 36,185 (2020 est.) in an area of 121.08 km². The municipality is sometimes referred as Aparecida do Norte.

==History==
Once part of the municipality of Guaratinguetá, it was emancipated in 1928.

==Geography==
Aparecida is located 168 km northeast of São Paulo and 240 km west of Rio de Janeiro.

With an average altitude of 544 meters, and elevations varying from 525 to 620 meters, Aparecida has a hot climate with dry winters. Recorded temperatures are a maximum of 35 °C, a minimum of -1 °C and an average of 22 °C.

==Main sights==
It is home to and named after the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida, the patron saint of Brazil, declared so by Pope Pius XI in 1929. Pope Benedict XVI delivered a speech here in May, 2007.

It now depends exclusively on tourism generated by the devotees surrounding the statue of the Virgin. Aparecida receives more than 7 million tourists a year making it the most popular religious pilgrimage site in Latin America.

These pilgrims come to visit the Basilica containing the statue of Our Lady of Aparecida. This statue, thought to have been found in the Paraíba River in October 1717, is made of clay and measures 40 centimeters in height. The dark colour was produced by the years of exposure to candles and lamps around the altar. In 1978 it was attacked and reduced to hundreds of fragments which were meticulously put back together by specialists from the São Paulo Museum of Art.

Aparecida was the source of a proposal endorsed by Pope Francis in 2020 to establish a collaborative ministry among the local churches of the various South American countries in the Amazon basin, with differentiated priorities.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).
