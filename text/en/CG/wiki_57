<text>Kennecott, also known as Kennicott and Kennecott Mines, is an abandoned mining camp in the Copper River Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska that was the center of activity for several copper mines. It is located beside the Kennicott Glacier, northeast of Valdez, inside Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. The camp and mines are now a National Historic Landmark District administered by the National Park Service.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

== History ==
In the summer of 1900, two prospectors, &quot;Tarantula&quot; Jack Smith and Clarence L. Warner, a group of prospectors associated with the McClellan party, spotted &quot;a green patch far above them in an improbable location for a grass-green meadow.&quot; The green turned out to be malachite, located with chalcocite (aka &quot;copper glance&quot;), and the location of the Bonanza claim. A few days later, Arthur Coe Spencer, U.S. Geological Survey geologist independently found chalcocite at the same location, but was too late to stake any valuable claims.

Stephen Birch, a mining engineer just out of school, was in Alaska looking for investment opportunities in minerals. He had the financial backing of the Havemeyer Family, and another investor named James Ralph, from his days in New York. Birch spent the winter of 1901-1902 acquiring the &quot;McClellan group&#x27;s interests&quot; for the Alaska Copper Company of Birch, Havemeyer, Ralph and Schultz, later to become the Alaska Copper and Coal Company. In the summer of 1901, he visited the property and &quot;spent months mapping and sampling.&quot; He confirmed the Bonanza mine and surrounding by deposits were, at the time, the richest known concentration of copper in the world.

By 1905, Birch had successfully defended the legal challenges to his property and he began the search for capital to develop the area. On June 28, 1906, he entered into &quot;an amalgamation&quot; with the Daniel Guggenheim and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., known as the Alaska Syndicate, eventually securing over $30 million. The capital was to be used for constructing a railway, a steamship line, and development of the mines. In Nov. 1906, the Alaska Syndicate bought a 40 percent interest in the Bonanza Mine from the Alaska Copper and Coal Company and a 46.2 percent interest in the railroad plans of John Rosene&#x27;s Northwestern Commercial Company.

Political battles over the mining and subsequent railroad were fought in the office of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt between conservationists and those having a financial interest in the copper.

The Alaska Syndicate traded its Wrangell Mountains Mines assets for shares in the Kennecott Copper Corporation, a &quot;new public company&quot; formed on April 29, 1915. A similar transaction followed with the CR&amp;NW railway and the Alaska Steamship Company. Birch was the managing partner for the Alaska operation.

Kennecott Mines was named after the Kennicott Glacier in the valley below. The geologist Oscar Rohn named the glacier after Robert Kennicott during the 1899 US Army Abercrombie Survey. A &quot;clerical error&quot; resulted in the substitution of an &quot;e&quot; for the &quot;i&quot;, supposedly by Stephen Birch himself.

Kennecott had five mines: Bonanza, Jumbo, Mother Lode, Erie and Glacier. Glacier, which is really an ore extension of the Bonanza, was an open-pit mine and was only mined during the summer. Bonanza and Jumbo were on Bonanza Ridge about from Kennecott. The Mother Lode mine was located on the east side of the ridge from Kennecott. The Bonanza, Jumbo, Mother Lode and Erie mines were connected by tunnels. The Erie mine was perched on the northwest end of Bonanza Ridge overlooking Root Glacier about up a glacial trail from Kennecott. Ore was hoisted to Kennecott via the trams which head-ended at Bonanza and Jumbo. From Kennecott the ore was hauled mostly in 140-pound sacks on steel flat cars to Cordova, 196 rail miles away, via the Copper River and Northwestern Railway (CRNW).

In 1911 the first shipment of ore by train transpired. Before completion, the steamship &quot;Chittyna&quot; carried ore to the Abercrombie landing by Miles Glacier. Initial ore shipments contained &quot;72 percent copper and 18 oz. of silver per ton.&quot;

In 1916, the peak year for production, the mines produced copper ore valued at $32.4 million.

In 1925 a Kennecott geologist predicted that the end of the high-grade ore bodies was in sight. The highest grades of ore were largely depleted by the early 1930s. The Glacier Mine closed in 1929. The Mother Lode was next, closing at the end of July 1938. The final three, Erie, Jumbo and Bonanza, closed that September. The last train left Kennecott on November 10, 1938, leaving it a ghost town.

From 1909 until 1938, except when it closed temporarily in 1932, Kennecott mines &quot;produced over 4.6 million tons of ore that contained 1.183 billion pounds of copper mainly from three ore bodies: Bonanza, Jumbo and Mother Lode.&quot; The Kennecott operations reported gross revenues above $200 million and a net profit greater than $100 million.

In 1938, Ernest Gruening proposed Kennecott be preserved as a National Park. A recommendation to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 18, 1940, for the establishment of the Kennecott National Monument went nowhere. However, December 2, 1980, saw the establishment of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

From 1939 until the mid-1950s, Kennecott was deserted except for a family of three who served as the watchmen until about 1952. In the late 1960s, an attempt was made to reprocess the tailings and to transport the ore in aircraft. The cost of doing so made the idea unprofitable. Around the same time, the company with land rights ordered the destruction of the town to rid them of liability for potential accidents. A few structures were destroyed, but the job was never finished and most of the town was left standing. Visitors and nearby residents have stripped many of the small items and artifacts. Some have since been returned and are held in various archives.

KCC sent a field party under the geologist Les Moon in 1955. They agreed with the 1938 conclusion, &quot;no copper resource of a size and grade sufficient to interest KCC remained.&quot; The mill and other structures remain, however, and many are in the process of being restored.

==Demographics==
Kennecott first reported on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It appeared again in 1930 and 1940, and after its abandonment, it has not reported separately since. It is now within the McCarthy CDP.

==Geology==
Copper ore was discovered in a lode on Chief Nikolai&#x27;s house at the mouth of Dan Creek in July 1899. The geological formations in the area were described and identified by a USGS geologist by the name of Oscar Rohn in 1899. This original copper find became the basis of the Nikolai Mine in 1900. Simultaneously, placer gold was discovered on the Dan and Young Creeks. The Bonanza ore body was discovered in Aug. 1900 by Warner and Smith. Almost simultaneously, another USGS geologist named Arthur Spencer, came across the ore when mapping the area with Frank Schrader. In 1901, the Dan Creek was staked by C.L. Warner and &quot;Dan&quot; L. Kain. Gold was found on Chititu Creek in April 1902 by Frank Kernan and Charles Koppus.

Besides placer deposits, copper is found as polymetallic replacement deposits in the fault planes, fractures and joints of the Triassic Nikolai greenstone, which consists of basaltic lava flows, and in the base of the Upper Triassic Chitistone limestone. Minerals include chalcocite, bornite and chalcopyrite, with associated malachite, azurite and cuprite. Native copper can also be found in the greenstone.
==Concentration Mill==

Copper extraction was a many step process in an attempt to be as efficient as possible. Chalcocite and covellite were sent directly to the smelting plant in Tacoma. Malachite, azurite, and other forms of copper within the limestone needed separation in the 14-story mill building before shipment. The mill was mainly built between 1909 and 1923. Ore arrived at the mill via aerial tramways, where the high-grade portion (approximately 60% copper) was crushed and placed in a chute to carry it directly to the bottom to be placed in burlap sacks. Lower-grade ore was further crushed, sized and sorted. The denser ore was separated from the less dense waste via Hancock jigs and shaker tables. The tailings left over after gravity separation were further treated via ammonia leaching, for the coarse material, or via froth flotation for the fine material. The ammonia leaching plant was built in 1915, where ammonia liquefied the copper but kept the limestone in solid form. The ammonia-copper solution was heated to drive off the ammonia, which left behind a copper oxide containing 75% copper. This was then sacked for shipment. The flotation plant was built in 1923 to process the &quot;fines&quot;, which were less than 0.3 cm in size. These fines were mixed with water, oil, and buffering chemicals, before air was bubbled through the solution. Copper ore attached to the air bubbles, and floated to the top, where it was skimmed off, dried and sacked.
== Tourism ==
In the 1980s, Kennecott became a popular tourist destination, as people came to see the old mines and buildings. However, the town of Kennecott was never repopulated. Residents involved in the tourism industry often lived in nearby McCarthy or on private land in the surrounding area. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986 and the National Park Service acquired much of the land within the Kennecott Mill Town in 1998.

Popular tourist activities while visiting Kennecott include glacier hiking, ice climbing, and touring the abandoned mill. Visitors may also hike to the abandoned Bonanza, Jumbo and Erie mines, all of which are strenuous full-day hikes, with Erie Mine being a somewhat terrifying scramble along cliffs overlooking the Stairway Icefall. Local guide services offer all of these hikes if one would like some route-finding assistance.

== Accessibility ==
Kennecott is now accessible by air (McCarthy has a meter gravel runway) or by driving on the Edgerton Highway to the McCarthy Road, an unimproved gravel road. The McCarthy Road ends at the Kennicott River and a footbridge is available for pedestrian traffic to McCarthy. From McCarthy, it is to Kennecott, and shuttles are available.

<doc id="991833" wikidata="Q976856" url="?curid=991833" title="Evil Genius (video game)">
<text>Evil Genius is a single-player real-time strategy and simulation video game developed by Elixir Studios and published by Sierra Entertainment, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal Games. It was released on 28 September 2004. The game is inspired by the spy thriller genre (notably the James Bond film series), and is set in an alternative 1960s–70s era. Most closely resembling &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, the gameplay puts players in charge of a villainous force attempting to achieve global domination whilst fending off the forces of justice; to this end the gameplay is split between management of a base and the completion of &quot;acts of infamy&quot; in the rest of the world. The game has stylish, cartoon-like visuals and contains a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humour, particularly playing to clichés of the spy genre.

Elixir once worked on a sequel, but it was cancelled following the studio&#x27;s closure. Since 2 March 2006, the intellectual property rights of the game have been owned by Rebellion Developments. Rebellion released a sequel, &quot;Evil Genius 2: World Domination&quot;, on 30 March 2021.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Evil Genius&quot; contains a mixture of real-time strategy and simulation elements, and is described by Rebellion Developments as a &quot;real-time mad scientist lair management strategic simulation&quot;. Gameplay is split between managing a lair, together with the &quot;minions&quot; that populate it, and the &quot;World Domination screen&quot;. The game is set in a non-specific time period, with the use of historic regions (the Eastern Bloc) and events (the Cuban Missile Crisis) suggestive of the 1960s and 1970s, albeit in an alternate timeline; furthermore, the styling of the game is reminiscent of the 1960s Atomic Age designs. &quot;Evil Genius&quot; consists of a single game mode wherein the ultimate goal is to build a doomsday device and force the capitulation of the world to the player&#x27;s &quot;Evil Genius&quot;. This figure is selected at the beginning of the game from one of three choices—Maximilian, Alexis or Shen Yu—and acts as the player&#x27;s avatar; if killed, the game ends.

The first lair is constructed within the base of a mountain on a desert island. During the course of the game the player relocates to a larger, tropical island, the extinct volcano at the center of which is used as the foundation for a rocket silo. The lair comprises various rooms, each of which contains objects for use by minions, either for the replenishment of certain &quot;stats&quot; (e.g. objects in the Mess Hall restore endurance) or to provide a function (e.g. the Power Plant room contains objects that generate power and allow the lair to function). Corridors connect the rooms within the lair and can also contain traps, which serve as one of several ways to deter agents of justice and their attempts to enter the base and gather evidence, steal money, or sabotage equipment. Trap results vary from simple confusion and movement impairment to stat reduction and death, and catching agents within a combination of traps will reward the player with money. New objects can eventually be unlocked through the Laboratory via combining already-existing items with pieces of equipment.

The player&#x27;s forces include their Evil Genius, unique henchmen, and various minions. The Evil Genius and henchmen may be directly controlled by the player while minions are managed through the use of orders (such as: create room, buy/build item, move item, or even attack or weaken target). Minions are all initially recruited as Construction minions which are the only type that can create rooms in the lair. As the game progresses, Construction minions may also be trained to specialize in one of three color-coded fields: military (orange), scientific (blue), or social (purple). Each field has three successive minion levels, with the third level having two specialized branches. All of the minion specializations are unlocked by acquiring and interrogating civilian hostages, after which their skills can be passed on to other minions via training equipment. Henchmen are unique named characters that are much stronger than conventional Minions and can be upgraded with two special moves after gaining experience. Each of the three Evil Geniuses are paired with a specific henchmen that is available from the beginning of the game, while additional henchmen may be recruited as the game progresses.

In addition to managing their lair, the Evil Genius&#x27;s plans frequently involve taking action across the world. This is managed through the &quot;World Domination screen&quot;, consisting of an interactive map of the world divided into regions to which the player is able to send minions from their lair to steal money or to plan and commit missions known as &quot;Acts of Infamy&quot;. These Acts can be used to obtain loot to adorn the lair (increasing minion statuses), capture civilian hostages (to interrogate them), and to garner &quot;Notoriety&quot;. Many Acts advance the ultimate goal of constructing the doomsday device. Acts require variable amounts and types of minions, and each carries a degree of risk. Although the player has no direct control over a mission, they can increase the chance of success by mixing minion classes and allocating greater numbers; the danger of committing Acts is compounded by the occasional appearance of Agents in certain regions, which the player can choose to hide their minions from. Some Acts of Infamy are references to historical events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, while others are comical, such as a &quot;humanitarian mission&quot; to destroy Nashville, Tennessee and rid the world of country music.

The lair must be defended from the &quot;forces of justice&quot;: five government counter-terrorist agencies under whose control the world is split. S.A.B.R.E controls Western Europe, Australasia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southern Africa. P.A.T.R.I.O.T controls North America and the &quot;Pacific Allies&quot; (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). H.A.M.M.E.R controls the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc, and Cuba. A.N.V.I.L controls China and Southeast Asia. S.M.A.S.H controls the remainder of the world with the Middle East, Northern and Central Africa, South America, and Antarctica. Any Act of Infamy carried out within a region, and even the mere presence of minions (but especially if they are siphoning money back to the lair) will increase the level of notice, or &quot;Heat&quot;, of the alliance that controls it, triggering a proportionate response: those alliances with the highest levels of heat will send their most skilled forces. Agents, appearing singularly or in groups, are divided according to their roles: Investigators, who will try to uncover evidence of illegal operations, thus increasing &quot;Heat&quot;; Saboteurs, whose goal is to destroy parts of the base; Thieves, who will attempt to steal back stolen items and cash; and Soldiers, who will assault minions, henchmen and the Evil Genius him/herself. As the player acquires &quot;Notoriety&quot;, they will attract the attention of &quot;Super Agents&quot;, one from each of the five alliances; these agents combine two of the aforementioned roles, require special objectives to be met to permanently defeat, and are able to kill henchmen over time by depleting their pool of lives.

==Development==
The game was in development for two years and two months. with between 20 and 25 people working on it at various times. 

==Reception==
&quot;Evil Genius&quot; has an average review score of 78% and 75 out of a possible 100, according to the review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic respectively, which indicates &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Most critics praised the game for its humour and unique take on the god-game genre, but also criticised it for its frustrating micromanagement and annoying bugs.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the game a 7.3 out of 10, stating that &quot;while Evil Genius&#x27; dry, campy humor is often amusing from the start, it takes quite a bit of time and effort to pull off acts of infamy and establish your notoriety among global powers&quot; and states &quot;&quot;Evil Genius&quot; is hampered by some frustratingly haphazard pacing as well as issues with the artificial intelligence of your minions&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Evil Genius&quot; a 7.8 out of 10, the reviewer stating that &quot;&quot;Evil Genius&quot; hearkens back to the glorious Bullfrog creation &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. Not only did it have us building a base underground (far, far underground), but also put us in the shoes of a sadistic dungeon master with imps, demons, and horned reapers to &quot;control&quot;. There are quite a few differences in the two titles, but the influence is certainly there&quot; but went on to say that &quot;had there been more interactivity with during acts of infamy on the World Domination Map, less micromanagement for taking care of enemies, more information passing between the map and the base screens, and more useful information about why things happened the way they did, &quot;Evil Genius&quot; really could have been genius... but in a good way&quot;.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave &quot;Evil Genius&quot; a 7 out of 10, commenting that &quot;even as we sit here picking over the carcass, we&#x27;re not actually all that angry about the things that are wrong with the game. They&#x27;re bad on paper, but they didn&#x27;t interfere hugely with our having fun - a sure sign that that &quot;Evil Genius&quot; overcomes its flaws and ultimately satisfies&quot;.

&quot;Evil Genius&quot;″ music score, composed by James Hannigan, received a BAFTA nomination for Best Original Music in 2004. Hannigan has spoken of how the work he did for the game stands out amongst his oeuvre, on account of its &quot;uniqueness&quot;.

==Sequel==

Financial reports at the end of 2004 revealed Elixir Studios had begun work on a sequel to &quot;Evil Genius&quot;. However, the studio&#x27;s closure in 2005 led to the project&#x27;s cancellation. While Rebellion purchased the intellectual property rights to Elixir&#x27;s titles, the franchise remained dormant for several years aside from being re-released on digital platforms and the release of several online games. A proper sequel, &quot;Evil Genius 2: World Domination&quot;, was released by Rebellion on 30 March 2021.

<text>High Peak Radio was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the Peak District, Derbyshire, from studios in Chapel-en-le-Frith. It broadcast on 106.4 (Buxton &amp; Glossop), 103.3 (Buxworth &amp; Hope Valley), and 106.6 FM (Chapel-en-le-Frith).

Its sister station, Ashbourne Radio, broadcast from Ashbourne on 96.7 FM (Ashbourne) and 101.8 FM (Wirksworth &amp; Uttoxeter). On 4 November 2019, both stations relaunched as Imagine Radio, sharing off-peak programming with its sister station in Stockport.

In June 2021, Bauer Media announced that they were buying the Imagine Radio stations from the Like Media Group, which would be merged into the Greatest Hits Radio network on 1 September 2021.

Several former High Peak Radio presenters joined a competing online station called Peak Sound Radio, formed after the closure of the Imagine stations.

<doc id="991844" wikidata="Q128379" url="?curid=991844" title="David Prowse">
<text>David Charles Prowse (1 July 1935 – 28 November 2020) was an English actor, bodybuilder, strongman and weightlifter. He portrayed Darth Vader in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and a manservant in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. In 2015, he starred in two documentaries concerning his Darth Vader role, one titled &quot;The Force&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, which included Prowse voicing Darth Vader&#x27;s lines with studio effects applied for the first time, and the other titled &quot;I Am Your Father&quot;, covering the subject of the fallout between Prowse and Lucasfilm.

Prior to his role as Vader, Prowse had established himself as a super-hero figure in the United Kingdom as the Green Cross Man in Green Cross Code media aimed at teaching children and young people road safety.

==Early life==
David Charles Prowse was born on 1 July 1935 in Bristol, England. He was the son of Gladys (&quot;née&quot; Burt) and Charles Prowse. He was brought up on the Southmead housing estate in Bristol, gaining a scholarship to Bristol Grammar School. Prowse was tall, standing , and developed an interest in bodybuilding. His early jobs included a bouncer at a dance hall, where he met his future wife, at Henleaze Swimming Pool. Following his successes from 1961 in the British heavyweight weightlifting championship, he left Bristol in 1963 to work for a London weightlifting company.

==Career==
===Weightlifting and training===

Prowse won the British heavyweight weightlifting championship in 1962. The following two years he represented England in the weightlifting event at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia. During his bodybuilding course, Prowse became friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno.

Prowse could deadlift as much as and was notable for being the first person to lift the Dinnie Stones. During his prime, Prowse weighed around .

During the 1970s, Prowse developed a minor interest with wrestling and trained many British wrestlers of the time.

Prowse helped to train Christopher Reeve for the lead role in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) after lobbying for the part himself. In a television interview, he related how his response to being told &quot;we&#x27;ve found our Superman&quot; was &quot;Thank you very much.&quot; Only then was he told that Reeve had been chosen for the role and he was to only be a trainer. He trained Cary Elwes for his role as Westley in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987).

Prowse also became fitness consultant to Harrods, ripped up phone books under the stage name &#x27;Jack the Ripper&#x27;, and opened a series of gyms, including The Dave Prowse Fitness Centre in Southwark, London. Notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes trained at Prowse&#x27;s gym and the British bodybuilder was also a judge at the last Mr. Universe contest Schwarzenegger won.

After making his last professional film appearance as Vader in 1983, he returned his major focus on weightlifting and continued to appear on some strength demonstrations in the United Kingdom until the late 1990s.

===Acting===
His first appearance is a brief cameo in a gym as a weightlifter in the 1968 TV show &quot;The Champions&quot;: the opening sequence of episode 2 &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. Also in 1968, he was cast as kilt wearing and bagpipe playing Emlyn MacGregor in The Beverly Hillbillies episode &quot;Coming Through the Rye&quot; (season 7 episode 4). He made an appearance as henchman Tony in the 1969 TV show The Saint (series 6 episode 20) starring Roger Moore.

In the United Kingdom, Prowse was well known as the Green Cross Man, a superhero invented to promote a road safety campaign for children in 1975. As a result of his association with the campaign, which ran between 1971 and 1990, he received the MBE in 2000.

He had a role as Frank Alexander&#x27;s manservant, Julian, in the film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), in which he was noticed by the future &quot;Star Wars&quot; director George Lucas. He played a circus strongman in &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; (1972), a Minotaur in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Time Monster&quot; (also 1972), and an android named Coppin in &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; in 1973. He appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Beta Cloud&quot; (1976), right before he was cast as Darth Vader. Around that time, he appeared as the Black Knight in the Terry Gilliam film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977) and was supposed to play Minoton in &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1977), but the part went to Peter Mayhew instead, who later played Chewbacca in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Prowse claimed that he nearly got the role of Jaws in &quot;James Bond&quot; (which ultimately went to Richard Kiel) and was offered the part of Conan the Barbarian before Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Prowse had a small role as Hotblack Desiato&#x27;s bodyguard in the 1981 BBC TV adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. He appeared in the first series of &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; on LWT and as a bodyguard in &quot;Callan&quot; (1974), a feature film version of the TV series, as well as the character Wellington in one episode of the TV series. He played Charles, the duke&#x27;s wrestler, in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;As You Like It&quot; in 1978.
Prowse played Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in three films, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and the Hammer horrors &quot;The Horror of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot;. Prowse made two uncredited appearances on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;. On Hill&#x27;s first show for Thames Television in 1969, he played a briefs-clad muscleman in the &quot;Ye Olde Wishing Well&quot; quickie, and in 1984 &quot;Scuttlevision&quot; he showed off his muscles in a sketch set to the song &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot;. The earlier routine was also featured in the 1974 film &quot;The Best of Benny Hill&quot;, in which he was credited.

Among his many non-speaking roles, Prowse played a major role in &quot;Portrait of Brenda&quot;, the penultimate episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; broadcast in 1969.

In May 2010, he played Frank Bryan in &quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot;, an independent British film produced by Queen Bee Films. The film screened at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.

====&quot;Star Wars&quot;====
Prowse played the physical form of Darth Vader in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Prowse spoke the dialogue during filming, but George Lucas wanted a &quot;darker voice&quot; than Prowse&#x27;s relatively jovial West Country accent, and had James Earl Jones provide a more sinister, malevolent voice for the character. Prowse stated he was originally told he would be seen and heard at the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; when Vader&#x27;s mask was removed. Instead, actor Sebastian Shaw was used. Upon Prowse&#x27;s death, Lucas stated that:David brought a physicality to Darth Vader that was essential for the character. He made Vader leap off the page and on to the big screen, with an imposing stature and movement performance to match the intensity and undercurrent of Vader&#x27;s presence. David was up for anything and contributed to the success of what would become a memorable, tragic figure.In the 2004 documentary &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot;, actress Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the original trilogy films, quipped that they nicknamed Prowse &quot;Darth Farmer&quot; (a jibe regarding his West Country accent). In the lightsaber fight scenes between Vader and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Prowse, who was not a very skilled swordsman and kept breaking the staffs used as the lightsabers, was replaced by the scene&#x27;s fight choreographer, the stuntman and fencing coach Bob Anderson. Prowse felt sidelined by Anderson during the making of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in particular, and said he was only able to persuade director Richard Marquand that he should be the one to throw Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) down the shaft after Marquand had tried and failed for a week to film the scene successfully without him.

Prowse reprised his role of Darth Vader for the video games &quot;Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game&quot; (1996) and &quot;Monopoly Star Wars&quot; (1997). In 1977, Prowse appeared as a contestant on the syndicated version of the game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;, hosted by Joe Garagiola.

After the original trilogy, future actors to succeed Prowse in his physical portrayal of Darth Vader include Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous (&quot;Rogue One&quot;), Hayden Christensen (&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;), Dmitrious Bistrevsky and Tom O&#x27;Connell (&quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;). Nevertheless, they were criticized by some fans of not having the same &quot;body width&quot; and intimidating movements as Prowse.

In 2002, Prowse became an honorary member and honorary leader of the 501st Legion, a fan group dedicated to &quot;Star Wars&quot; costuming.

Prowse continued to associate himself with his role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and was involved in the convention circuit. Despite this, he was not included in some reunions of the original cast, such as those for the &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot; documentary and the 2005 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cover. While being interviewed by Kevin Moore of &quot;The Moore Show Prime Time&quot;, he admitted his dislike of the prequel trilogy and said the new films were &quot;out of context&quot; in terms of special effects in comparison to the original trilogy.

In July 2007, Prowse joined many others from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films for the first ever &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration event held outside the United States. It was run by Lucasfilm Ltd. and the Cards Inc. Group, at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London. The occasion was to mark the 30th anniversary of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Prowse played a cameo role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan films &quot;Order of the Sith: Vengeance&quot; and its sequel &quot;Downfall&quot; – &quot;Order of the Sith&quot;, alongside Jeremy Bulloch and Michael Sheard. These fan films were made in Britain in support of the charity Save the Children.

In 2008, he was one of the cast members featured on Justin Lee Collins&#x27;s &quot;Bring Back...Star Wars&quot;. In the episode, Prowse commented that he had a dispute with Lucas after he allegedly leaked reports of Darth Vader&#x27;s death to the press. Prowse had previously suggested that Darth Vader could be Luke Skywalker&#x27;s father in a speech he gave to University of California, Berkeley, in 1978. However, this was shortly after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and nearly two years before &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was released, and the script had not even been written at the time. Gary Kurtz, the producer of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, said in the 2015 documentary &quot;I Am Your Father&quot; that Prowse&#x27;s apparent plot spoiler was simply &quot;a good guess.&quot;

Prowse stated his contract for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; included a share of profits on the film, and although it grossed $475 million on a $32 million budget, Prowse explained in an interview in 2009 that he never received residuals for his performance. Due to &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot;, the actual profits are sent as &quot;distribution fees&quot; to the studio, leaving nothing to distribute to others.

In July 2010, Prowse was banned by Lucas from attending official &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan conventions. Lucas had given Prowse no reason, other than stating that Prowse &quot;burnt too many bridges&quot; between Lucasfilm and himself.

In 2011, Prowse wrote and released his autobiography &quot;Straight from the Force&#x27;s Mouth&quot;.

A 2015 Spanish documentary by filmmaker Marcos Cabotá, entitled &quot;I Am Your Father&quot;, detailed Prowse&#x27;s then life and his blackballing by Lucasfilm, which the documentary suggested was unjustified. The leaks featured in the documentary originated from a technician working on the films.

===Partnership with Jayce Lewis===

Prowse became friends with Welsh musician Jayce Lewis when the latter was a teenager, after they met at a science fiction convention. At the convention, Lewis recalled learning that Prowse&#x27;s son, whom he later met after a performance, was also a drummer. On their shared musical interest, Prowse identified himself as &quot;a music fan for years, going from big band jazz, trad jazz, modern and progressive.&quot;

The two became business partners with Prowse taking on a management and public relations role. He was also featured in the music video for &quot;Shields&quot; on the album &quot;Orderart&quot;. On 1 October 2015, Lewis created a mini-documentary entitled &quot;The Force&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, which gave Prowse the opportunity to hear himself voicing Darth Vader&#x27;s lines with studio effects applied for the first time.

==Personal life==
Prowse married Norma Scammell in 1963 and was the father of three children. He was a supporter of Bristol Rugby Club. He lived in Addiscombe, Croydon, in Surrey from 1963.

Prowse publicly declared his support for the United Kingdom Independence Party in the 2009 European Parliament election: &quot;I&#x27;ve looked right and left and right again and the only party I can safely vote for is UKIP.&quot;

===Health problems===
Prowse suffered from arthritis for much of his life. This led to replacements of both hips, and to his ankle being fused, as well as several revisionary surgeries on his hip replacements. His arthritic symptoms first appeared when he was 13. Though they seemingly disappeared after he took up competitive weightlifting, they reappeared in 1990.

Prowse worked with multiple arthritis organisations in Britain and was vice-president of the Physically Handicapped and Able-bodied Association.

In March 2009, Prowse revealed that he was suffering from prostate cancer. He underwent radiation therapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital in South London. Later that year he was said to be in remission.

In November 2014, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that he had dementia. Prowse denied this, but admitted that he had problems with his memory, which he put down to age.

===Retirement===
In late 2017, Prowse retired from all public appearances and events, due to ill health and the wishes of his family. His final onscreen appearance was filmed with his long-time friend the Welsh musician Jayce Lewis in a sci-fi music video titled &quot;Shields&quot;. Upon completing production Prowse was quoted as saying; &quot;Well, that&#x27;s that&quot; and Jayce as responding; &quot;Job done, Legacy made!&quot;

===Death===

Prowse died at a hospital in London, England, on 28 November 2020, aged 85.

==Honours and awards==
Prowse was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to charity and road safety at the New Year Honours in 2000.

<text>Elizabeth LeCompte (born April 28, 1944) is an American director of experimental theater, dance, and media. A founding member of The Wooster Group, she has directed that ensemble since its emergence in the late 1970s.

== Life and career ==
LeCompte was born and grew up in New Jersey. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Fine Arts from Skidmore College. She met director and actor Willem Dafoe at The Performance Group and began a professional and personal relationship. Their son, Jack, was born in 1982.

With The Wooster Group, she has composed, designed, and directed over forty works for theater, dance, film and video, starting with &quot;Sakonnet Point&quot; in 1975. These works characteristically interweave performance with multimedia technologies and are strongly influenced by historical and contemporary visual arts and architecture. She is known both for taking apart and reworking classics such as &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, and &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot; as well as constructing new works from scratch.

Prior to her work with The Wooster Group, she was a member of the experimental theater company The Performance Group from 1970 to 1975. Subsequently, LeCompte and Spalding Gray founded The Wooster Group, along with Jim Clayburgh, Willem Dafoe, Peyton Smith, Kate Valk, and Ron Vawter. For her work with these groups, LeCompte was included in Mitter and Shevtsova&#x27;s 2004 volume discussing 50 influential theater directors around the world. Other writers consistently include her in the lineage of experimental theater artists that passes through Meyerhold and Grotowski to the present generation of &quot;postdramatic&quot; theater makers. As a &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer put it: &quot;Luminaries of the theatrical avant-garde—Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, and Peter Sellars among them—describe her as first among equals&quot;.

LeCompte has lectured and taught at American University, the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia University, Connecticut College, the Lincoln Center Theatre Directors Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Northeastern University, the O’Neill Center, Smith College, the University of London, and the Yale School of Drama. In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critics ranked &quot;House/Lights&quot; the 16th greatest American play since &quot;Angels in America&quot;.

== Awards ==
Among her honors, LeCompte has received the National Endowment for the Arts Distinguished Artists Fellowship for Lifetime Achievement in the American Theater, the MacArthur Fellowship, the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Cultural Ministry, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship, a United States Artists Fellowship, an Anonymous Was A Woman Award, the Theater Practitioner Award from Theatre Communications Group, The Skowhegan Medal for Performance, a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Performance Artist Award and honorary doctorates from the New School for Social Research and the California Institute of the Arts. She was included in the 1993 Whitney Biennial. She won the 2016 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize.

<doc id="991848" wikidata="Q233707" url="?curid=991848" title="Michelle Ryan">
<text>Michelle Ryan (born 22 April 1984) is an English actress, best known for portraying the role of Zoe Slater in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2000–2005). In 2007, she starred in the short-lived American television series &quot;Bionic Woman&quot;. She appeared as the evil sorceress Nimueh in the 2008 BBC fantasy series &quot;Merlin&quot; and as Lady Christina de Souza in the 2009 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Michelle Ryan was born on 22 April 1984 in Enfield, London.

She attended Chace Community School, and belonged to a local theatre company from the age of 10. 

==Career==
===2000–2006: &quot;EastEnders&quot; and other work===
Ryan was chosen for the role of Zoe Slater in &quot;EastEnders&quot; when she was 15, making her first appearance in the soap alongside the Slater family in September 2000. Her character&#x27;s key storylines in the soap included discovering Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) was her mother and not her sister, as well as being involved in the cover up of the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). She left the series in June 2005.

Following her departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Ryan appeared in a run of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Daddy?&quot; at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre. The play, by Toby Young and Lloyd Evans, is based on the David Blunkett paternity case. She had a small role in an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; which screened in February 2006, and also appeared in a small independent film the same year, &quot;Cashback&quot;.

===2007–2008: &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, &quot;Jekyll&quot; and &quot;Bionic Woman&quot;===

In early 2007, Ryan was seen as Maria in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; opposite Billie Piper for ITV and also as Lila in the film &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, co-starring Carmen Electra and Mackenzie Crook.

In February 2007, it was announced that she had been cast as the lead in the drama &quot;Bionic Woman,&quot; a remake of the 70s series. The show began airing in the United States on the broadcast network NBC in September 2007. Ryan affected an American accent for the role of Jaime Sommers, except in the episode &quot;The Education of Jaime Sommers&quot; in which her character goes undercover as an English transfer student at a university; for this episode, she spoke in an Oxfordshire accent instead of her natural London accent. She has had professional dance training and attributed it to helping her with the physically demanding stunts required for the show. She also learned Krav Maga and sign language for the part (the latter because, as originally conceived, Ryan&#x27;s character was to have had a hearing impaired sister, but this story element was abandoned). Ryan stated the show&#x27;s cancellation came about because it kept changing direction, and stated it led to her being less ambitious about her career. &quot;I&#x27;m more go-with-the-flow now&quot;, she said.

On Red Nose Day 2007, Ryan appeared in a &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; sketch written and recorded for &quot;Comic Relief&quot;.

In May 2007, Ryan revealed she had auditioned the previous year for the role of Vesper Lynd in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, eventually given to Eva Green. In late 2007, she appeared in &quot;Flick&quot;, a Welsh independent film co-starring Faye Dunaway and Leslie Phillips.

Prior to &quot;Bionic Woman&quot;, she appeared in &quot;Jekyll&quot; for the BBC, a modern-day version of &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; starring James Nesbitt. It began its six-episode run on 16 June 2007, and was released on DVD in the United States on 18 September 2007, one week prior to her debut in &quot;Bionic Woman&quot;.

===2008–2011: &quot;Merlin&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Mister Eleven&quot;===
She has also appeared as the sorceress Nimueh in the BBC drama series &quot;Merlin&quot;, playing the role in several episodes of the show&#x27;s first season.

Ryan also filmed an ITV romantic drama, &quot;Mister Eleven&quot; in 2008.

In January 2009, the BBC announced that Ryan had been cast as Lady Christina de Souza in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; special episode &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;, which was broadcast on 11 April 2009. She had been rumoured for a part beforehand, and is open to reprising the role in future, although &quot;At the moment, when it comes to acting, I&#x27;m a bit of a commitment-phobe.&quot;

Ryan and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; star Kevin McKidd starred in a one-off drama for BBC Scotland, &quot;One Night In Emergency&quot;, the story of one man&#x27;s surreal search for his wife in an inner-city hospital. The film, which was filmed in and around Glasgow, was written by Gregory Burke, and directed by Michael Offer.

Also in 2009, Ryan filmed &quot;4.3.2.1.&quot;, a crime thriller starring Emma Roberts, Noel Clarke, Tamsin Egerton and Ophelia Lovibond.

She starred in a stage production of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; at the Royal Theatre in Northampton until 9 October 2010.

In October 2010, she completed filming the terrorist thriller &quot;Cleanskin&quot;. That same year, she appeared in the comedy film &quot;Huge&quot; alongside Noel Clarke, Johnny Harris, Ralph Brown, Thandiwe Newton, and Tamsin Egerton, directed by Ben Miller. Another film, &quot;No Ordinary Trifle&quot;, is in post-production. Also in 2011, Ryan played Helena from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in the BBC Learning project, &quot;Off By Heart Shakespeare&quot;.

===2012–present: &quot;Cockneys vs Zombies&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;===
Ryan also appeared in &quot;Cockneys vs Zombies&quot;, a comedy horror film about a team of bank robbers fighting the undead, directed by Matthias Hoene, alongside Georgia King, Rasmus Hardiker and Jack Doolan. The film was released in September 2012.

For the final months of 2012, Ryan toured with Will Young in a production of &quot;Cabaret&quot;. This production also played in London&#x27;s West End.

In 2018, Ryan began reprising her &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role as Lady Christina in her own Big Finish Productions spinoff audio drama series.

==Other activities==
Ryan is a patron of children&#x27;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent, and is active in The Big Cat Sanctuary, a registered animal charity whose aim is to contribute to global conservation, and The Total Green School Awards which encourages environmental education in schools and rewards outstanding projects.

<text>A hose is a flexible hollow tube or pipe designed to carry fluids from one location to another, often from a faucet or hydrant. 

Early hoses were made of leather, although modern hoses are typically made of rubber, canvas, and helically wound wire. Hoses may also be made from plastics such as polyvinyl chloride, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, or from metals such as stainless steel.

<text>In computing, a group of parallel arrays (also known as structure of arrays or SoA) is a form of implicit data structure that uses multiple arrays to represent a singular array of records. It keeps a separate, homogeneous data array for each field of the record, each having the same number of elements. Then, objects located at the same index in each array are implicitly the fields of a single record. Pointers from one object to another are replaced by array indices. This contrasts with the normal approach of storing all fields of each record together in memory (also known as array of structures or AoS). For example, one might declare an array of 100 names, each a string, and 100 ages, each an integer, associating each name with the age that has the same index.

== Examples ==

An example in C using parallel arrays:
int ages[] = {0, 17, 2, 52, 25};
char *names[] = {&quot;None&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Billy&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;};
int parent[] = {0 /*None*/, 3 /*Tom*/, 1 /*Mike*/, 0 /*None*/, 3 /*Tom*/};

for (i = 1; i &lt;= 4; i++) {
 printf(&quot;Name: %s, Age: %d, Parent: %s \n&quot;,
 names[i], ages[i], names[parent[i]]);


in Perl (using a hash of arrays to hold references to each array):

my %data = (
 first_name =&gt; [&#x27;Joe&#x27;, &#x27;Bob&#x27;, &#x27;Frank&#x27;, &#x27;Hans&#x27; ],
 last_name =&gt; [&#x27;Smith&#x27;,&#x27;Seger&#x27;,&#x27;Sinatra&#x27;,&#x27;Schultze&#x27;],
 height_in_cm =&gt; [169, 158, 201, 199 ]);

for $i (0..$#{$data{first_name}}) {
 printf &quot;Name: %s %s\n&quot;, $data{first_name}[$i], $data{last_name}[$i];
 printf &quot;Height in CM: %i\n&quot;, $data{height_in_cm}[$i];


Or, in Python:

first_names = [&quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Hans&quot; ]
last_names = [&quot;Smith&quot;,&quot;Seger&quot;,&quot;Sinatra&quot;,&quot;Schultze&quot;]
heights_in_cm = [169, 158, 201, 199 ]

for i in range(len(first_names)):
 print(&quot;Name: %s %s&quot; % (first_names[i], last_names[i]))
 print(&quot;Height in cm: %s&quot; % heights_in_cm[i])

# Using zip:
for first_name, last_name, height_in_cm in zip(first_names, last_names, heights_in_cm):
 print(f&quot;Name: {first_name} {last_name}&quot;)
 print(f&quot;Height in cm: {height_in_cm}&quot;)
==Pros and cons==

Parallel arrays have a number of practical advantages over the normal approach:
* They can save a substantial amount of space in some cases by avoiding alignment issues. For example, some architectures work best if 4-byte integers are always stored beginning at memory locations that are multiple of 4. If the previous field was a single byte, 3 bytes might be wasted. Many modern compilers can automatically avoid such problems, though in the past some programmers would explicitly declare fields in order of decreasing alignment restrictions.
* If the number of items is small, array indices can occupy significantly less space than full pointers, particularly on some architectures.
* Sequentially examining a single field of each record in the array is very fast on modern machines, since this amounts to a linear traversal of a single array, exhibiting ideal locality of reference and cache behaviour.
* They may allow efficient processing with SIMD instructions in certain instruction set architectures

Several of these advantages depend strongly on the particular programming language and implementation in use.

However, parallel arrays also have several strong disadvantages, which serves to explain why they are not generally preferred:

* They have significantly worse locality of reference when visiting the records non-sequentially and examining multiple fields of each record, because the various arrays may be stored arbitrarily far apart.
* They obscure the relationship between fields of a single record (e.g. no type information relates the index between them, an index may be used erroneously).
* They have little direct language support (the language and its syntax typically express no relationship between the arrays in the parallel array, and cannot catch errors).
* Since the bundle of fields is not a &quot;thing&quot;, passing it around is tedious and error-prone. For example, rather than calling a function to do something to one record (or structure or object), the function must take the fields as separate arguments. When a new field is added or changed, many parameter lists must change, where passing objects as whole would avoid such changes entirely.
* They are expensive to grow or shrink, since each of several arrays must be reallocated. Multi-level arrays can ameliorate this problem, but impacts performance due to the additional indirection needed to find the desired elements.
* Perhaps worst of all, they greatly raise the possibility of errors. Any insertion, deletion, or move must always be applied consistently to all of the arrays, or the arrays will no longer be synchronized with each other, leading to bizarre outcomes.

The bad locality of reference can be alleviated in some cases: if a structure can be divided into groups of fields that are generally accessed together, an array can be constructed for each group, and its elements are records containing only these subsets of the larger structure&#x27;s fields. (see data-oriented design). This is a valuable way of speeding up access to very large structures with many members, while keeping the portions of the structure tied together. An alternative to tying them together using array indexes is to use references to tie the portions together, but this can be less efficient in time and space.

Another alternative is to use a single array, where each entry is a record structure. Many language provide a way to declare actual records, and arrays of them. In other languages it may be feasible to simulate this by declaring an array of n*m size, where m is the size of all the fields together, packing the fields into what is effectively a record, even though the particular language lacks direct support for records. Some compiler optimizations, particularly for vector processors, are able to perform this transformation automatically when arrays of structures are created in the program.

<text>Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville (; 31 May 183518 May 1885) was a French academic painter who studied under Eugène Delacroix. His dramatic and intensely patriotic subjects illustrated episodes from the Franco-Prussian War, the Crimean War, the Zulu War, and portraits of soldiers. Some of his works have been collected by the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and by the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

==Early life==

Born Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe Deneuville to wealthy parents at Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais, he earned his degree of &quot;bachelier ès-lettres&quot;, and in 1856 entered the naval school at Lorient in spite of family opposition. It was there that his artistic instincts started.

The young Alphonse de Neuville was discouraged by several painters of repute, but he was admitted to work in the studio of François-Edouard Picot. He did not remain there long. He was already painting by himself when he produced his first picture, &quot;The Fifth Battalion of Chasseurs at the Gervais Battery&quot; (Malakoff). In 1860, Neuville painted an &quot;Episode of the taking of Naples by Garibaldi&quot; for the Artists&#x27; Club in the rue de Provence. In 1861, he sent &quot;The Guard Chasseurs in the Trenches of the Mamelon Vert&quot; to the Paris Salon.

==Illustrator and military artist==
Neuville participated in illustrating Pierre-Jules Hetzel&#x27;s editions of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. He also illustrated &quot;Le Tour du monde&quot; and François Guizot&#x27;s &quot;History of France&quot;. At the same time he painted a number of remarkable pictures: &quot;The Attack in the Streets of Magenta by Zouaves and the Light Horse&quot; (1864), &quot;A Zouave Sentinel&quot; (1865), &quot;The Battle of San Lorenzo&quot; (1867), and &quot;Dismounted Cavalry crossing the Tchernaia&quot; (1869). In these he showed peculiar insight into military life.

He reached the peak of his career after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. The long-term French reaction was revanchism: a deep sense of bitterness, hatred, and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat were in high demand, such as &quot;The Spy&quot; by de Neuville.

In response, Neuville aimed at depicting episodes of the Franco-Prussian War in his works, and began by representing the &quot;Bivouac before Le Bourget&quot; (1872). His fame spread rapidly and was increased by &quot;The Last Cartridges&quot; (1873), memorializing an episode involving the Blue Division of the French marines, in which it is easy to discern the vast difference between the conventional treatment of military subjects, as practised by Horace Vernet, and that of a man who had lived the life that he painted.

&quot;Fight on a Railroad&quot; (1874) was equally successful, and was followed by the &quot;Attack on a House at Villersexel&quot; (1875) and the &quot;Railway Bridge at Styring&quot; (1877). In 1878 (but not at the Great Exhibition), the painter exhibited &quot;Le Bourget&quot;, the &quot;Surprise at Daybreak&quot;, &quot;The Intercepted Despatch-bearer&quot;, and a considerable number of drawings. He also exhibited in London some episodes of the Zulu War. Fifty thousand people paid to see his impression of &quot;The Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; (1880), which the infant Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney paid a large sum to acquire.

In 1881, he was made an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur for &quot;The Cemetery of Saint-Privat&quot;, &quot;The Despatch-bearer&quot;, and &quot;Huns in the Battle of Chalon&quot;. During these years Neuville was at work with Édouard Detaille on an important although less artistic work, &quot;The Panorama of Rézonville&quot;.

Neuville died in Paris on May 18, 1885. At the sale of his works the state purchased the paintings &quot;Bourget&quot; and &quot;Attack on a Barricaded House&quot;, as well as watercolor &quot;The Parley&quot; and the drawing &quot;Turco in Fighting Trim&quot;, for the purpose of displaying them at the Palais du Luxembourg.

<doc id="991861" wikidata="Q3355416" url="?curid=991861" title="Orderly Departure Program">
<text>The Orderly Departure Program (ODP) was a program to permit immigration of Vietnamese to the United States and to other countries. It was created in 1979 under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The objective of the ODP was to provide a mechanism for Vietnamese to leave their homeland safely and in an orderly manner to be resettled abroad. Prior to the ODP, tens of thousands of &quot;boat people&quot; were fleeing Vietnam monthly by boat and turning up on the shores of neighboring countries. Under the ODP, from 1980 until 1997, 623,509 Vietnamese were resettled abroad of whom 458,367 went to the United States. 

==Background==

In June 1979, more than 54,000 Vietnamese refugees arrived by boat in neighboring Southeast Asian countries and Hong Kong. This culminated in several months in which the numbers of refugees making the dangerous passage in small boats from Vietnam had steadily grown. With new arrivals of Vietnam piling up in squalid refugee camps, the countries of Southeast Asia united in declaring that they had &quot;reached the limit of their endurance and decided that they would not accept any new arrivals.&quot;

In response, the UNHCR convened an international conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in July 1979, stating that &quot;a grave crisis exists in Southeast Asia for hundreds of thousands of refugees.&quot; Illustrating the prominence of the issue, Vice President Walter Mondale headed the U.S. delegation. The results of the conference were that the Southeast Asian countries agreed to provide temporary asylum to the refugees, Vietnam agreed to promote orderly departures and prevent the exodus of boat people, and the Western countries agreed to accelerate resettlement. The Orderly Departure Program enabled Vietnamese, if approved, to depart Vietnam for resettlement in another country without having to leave their country and attempt the voyage by boat to a neighboring country.

==Objectives and results==

As a result of the agreements at the Geneva conference, boat people leaving Vietnam declined to a few thousand per month and resettlements increased from 9,000 per month in early 1979 to 25,000 per month. The worst of the humanitarian crisis was over, although boat people would continue to leave Vietnam for more than another decade and die at sea or be confined to lengthy stays in refugee camps.

The objectives of the Orderly Departure Program were &quot;family reunion and other humanitarian cases.&quot; France saw the ODP as primarily a refugee program, i.e., to resettle political refugees; Canada, Australia, and New Zealand saw it as a family reunification program; and the U.S. wished to secure departure from Vietnam for former U.S. employees and relatives of Vietnamese in the U.S. 

Persons eligible for emigration out of Vietnam were determined by an exchange of lists between the government of Vietnam and the resettlement country. The Vietnamese list included persons the Vietnamese government had been approved for departure; the list of the resettlement country included those persons that country wished to accept. The first lists were exchanged by the U.S and Vietnam in late 1979. The US list consisted of 4,000 persons, mostly former employees of the U.S. and of Vietnamese with relatives in the United States. The Vietnamese list included 21,000 persons, the majority of them ethnic Chinese. There was very little overlap between the two lists and it took nearly 18 months of negotiation managed by UNHCR to agree on 1,700 persons eligible for the ODP. Despite this slow start, however, the ODP slowly gained steam with the number of Vietnamese immigrants under ODP rising to several tens of thousands per year. 
The Orderly Departure Program office of the U.S. was initially established in Bangkok, Thailand, in January 1980. On September 14, 1994, registration for the ODP was closed. In 1999, after normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Vietnam, the office in Bangkok was closed and the remaining open cases were transferred to the Refugee Resettlement Section at the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 

Although registration for the ODP ended in 1994, in 2005 the United States and Vietnam signed an agreement which allows those Vietnamese to register for immigration who were not able to do so before ODP registration ended.

The following table identifies those countries accepting the greatest number of Vietnamese immigrants under the Orderly Departure Program. A few thousand additional Vietnamese were resettled after 1997. More than 40 countries participated in the program.

<text>David Christopher Kelley (born June 23, 1949) is an American philosopher. He is a professed Objectivist, though his position that Objectivism can be revised and influenced by other schools of thought has prompted disagreements with other Objectivists. Kelley is also an author of several books on philosophy and the founder of The Atlas Society, an institution he established in 1990 after permanently dissociating with Leonard Peikoff and the Ayn Rand Institute.

==Education and career==
David Kelley was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in philosophy from Brown University, where he studied with the American rationalist, Roderick Chisholm. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University in 1975 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;The Evidence of the Senses&quot;, under the supervision of Richard Rorty. He was an assistant professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Vassar College for seven years. He then taught logic for a brief time at Brandeis University, while working as a freelance writer for &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; and other publications.

A member of Ayn Rand&#x27;s circle, Kelley read her favorite poem, &quot;If—&quot;, by Rudyard Kipling, at her funeral in 1982.

===Objectivism&#x27;s &#x27;open&#x27; faction===
In 1985, Leonard Peikoff and Ed Snider founded the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI), an organization devoted to the study and advocacy of Objectivism. Kelley was initially affiliated with ARI, but in 1989 he was criticized by Peter Schwartz, editor of the Objectivist newsletter &quot;The Intellectual Activist&quot;, for giving a speech under the auspices of Laissez Faire Books (LFB), a libertarian bookseller. Schwartz argued that this activity violated the Objectivist moral principle of sanction. He said Kelley was implicitly conferring moral approval on LFB by appearing at an event that it sponsored. Schwartz considered LFB morally objectionable because it promoted books, such as &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot;, that he maintained were hostile and defamatory towards Rand and Objectivism. Kelley responded with a privately circulated essay titled &quot;A Question of Sanction&quot;, which disputed Schwartz&#x27;s interpretation of the sanction principle. Peikoff subsequently endorsed Schwartz&#x27;s view and claimed that Kelley&#x27;s arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. He also declared Objectivism to be a &quot;closed system&quot; containing only the philosophic principles advocated by Rand herself.

Kelley responded to this dispute in a monograph titled &quot;Truth and Toleration&quot;, later expanded and republished as &quot;The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand&quot;. Kelley declared Objectivism to be an &quot;open system&quot; amenable to revision and addition. This disagreement split the Objectivist movement into two factions.

In 1990, he founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies (IOS), a non-profit dedicated to cultural advocacy on behalf of &quot;reason, individualism, achievement, and capitalism.&quot; IOS was established to provide an Objectivist alternative to the Ayn Rand Institute. IOS sponsored scholarly work on Objectivism and conducted summer workshops attended by academics and graduate students. In 1999, IOS was renamed The Objectivist Center (TOC), as the organization took on a more public-outreach and advocacy orientation.

In order to pursue his scholarly interests, Kelley stepped down as executive director of TOC in 2004, and the organization was again renamed as The Atlas Society (TAS). Kelley reassumed the position of executive director for TAS in 2008. He retired in 2018, but continues to serve on the organization&#x27;s board of trustees.

===Scholarly work===
Kelley&#x27;s books cover a variety of subjects within philosophy. They include &quot;The Evidence of the Senses&quot;, which argues for a unique form of direct realism about perception; &quot;Unrugged Individualism&quot;, which explores benevolence as a virtue; &quot;A Life of One&#x27;s Own&quot;, a moral critique of the welfare state; and &quot;The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand&quot;, focusing on the schisms within the Objectivist movement. With Roger Donway, he co-authored &quot;Laissez Parler: Freedom in the Electronic Media&quot;, a critique of government regulation of broadcasting.

Kelley has published little scholarly work in philosophy since 1998, but has given public addresses, taught courses, and has written articles on politics and current events. An ongoing research and writing project over the past decade has been his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Logical Structure of Objectivism,&quot; which he is co-authoring with economist William Thomas. His most recent scholarly article is &quot;Rand Versus Hayek on Abstraction,&quot; in the Fall 2011 issue of &quot;Reason Papers&quot;—a &quot;descriptive and explanatory&quot; account of the similarities and differences between Rand&#x27;s and Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s views on cognition and mind.

Kelley was a script consultant for &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part III&quot;, the third part in a film version of Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.

<text>The Black Chamber, officially the Cable and Telegraph Section and also known as the Cipher Bureau, was the first peacetime cryptanalytic organization in the United States, operating from 1917 to 1929. It was a forerunner of the National Security Agency (NSA).

== History ==
Until World War I, the only codes and cypher organizations created by the U.S. government were short-lived agencies of the United States Armed Forces, such as the U.S. Army&#x27;s Military Intelligence (MI-8).

The Cable and Telegraph Section or Cipher Bureau was established on April 28, 1917, three weeks after the U.S. Congress declared war on the German Empire and began American involvement in World War I. It was headquartered in Washington, D.C., operated under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization, and was moved in the Army&#x27;s organizational chart several times. On July 5, 1917, Herbert O. Yardley was assigned to head the Cipher Bureau, which consisted of Yardley and two civilian clerks. It absorbed the Navy&#x27;s cryptanalysis functions in July 1918.

The Cipher Bureau moved to New York City on May 20, 1919, where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company, or the Black Chamber, under Yardley&#x27;s command. Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department, the Cipher Bureau was tasked with breaking the communications of other nations, primarily diplomatic communications, as occurred during the Washington Naval Conference.

According to intelligence historian James Bamford, the Black Chamber secured the cooperation of American telegraph companies such as Western Union in illegally turning over the cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates. Eventually, &quot;almost the entire American cable industry&quot; was part of this effort. However, these companies eventually withdrew their support, possibly due to the Radio Act of 1927, which broadened criminal offenses related to breaching the confidentiality of telegraph messages.

In 1929, the State Department withdrew its share of the funding while the Army, undergoing unit reorganizations, transferred the Black Chamber to the Signal Corps, which opted to rebuild the organization for their own purposes and dismissed Yardley and all of his employees. New Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson made this decision, and years later in his memoirs made the oft-quoted comment: &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; Stimson&#x27;s ethical reservations about cryptanalysis focused on the targeting of diplomats from the U.S.&#x27;s close allies, not on spying in general. Once he became Secretary of War during World War II, he and the entire U.S. command structure relied heavily on decrypted enemy communications.

== Legacy ==
In 1931, Yardley, out of a job and desperate for an income during the Great Depression, wrote a book about the Cipher Bureau, titled &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot;. The term &quot;Black Chamber&quot; predates Yardley&#x27;s use of it in the title of his book.

During World War II, the Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the Axis powers. When the war ended, the SIS was reorganized as the Army Security Agency (ASA). On May 20, 1949, all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), a division of the Department of Defense that, after issues relating to poor interagency communication and coordination, was reformed on November 4, 1952 into the National Security Agency (NSA).

<doc id="991867" wikidata="Q7894977" url="?curid=991867" title="University Village, Seattle">
<text>University Village (colloquially known as U-Village) is a shopping mall in northeastern Seattle, Washington, United States, located in the south corner of the Ravenna neighborhood to the north of the Downtown area. It is an open-air shopping center which offers restaurants, locally owned boutiques, and national retailers, and is a popular retail destination in the region for home furnishings, popular fashions, gift items, and restaurants. It is currently owned by multimillionaire Stuart Sloan.

==History==

===Creation===
University Village was originally developed by Continental Inc. who also developed Westwood Village in West Seattle and Aurora Village in Shoreline, Washington. it was once home to a Coast Salish village named sluʔwiɫ, which means &quot;Little Canoe Channel&quot; in Lushootseed.

The shopping center was built in 1956 across NE 45th Street on an earlier part of the Montlake Landfill (since 1911, 1922–1966), taking out what remained of the Union Bay Marsh that was drained by the lowering of Lake Washington as a result of the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal (1913–1916). Some wetland was later partially restored as the Union Bay Natural Area with the Center for Urban Horticulture.

===Early history===
Until the early 1990s, the character of University Village was decidedly different. Most of its businesses were small, and the chain stores were all local: Ernst Hardware and Malmo Nursery, Lamonts department store (acquired by Gottschalks in 2000), Pay &#x27;n Save Drugs (sold to PayLess Drug in the early 1990s), and QFC supermarket, then a much smaller facility on the western side of the property, formerly an A&amp;P store. The present QFC store on the east edge opened in 1996, it was formerly a dairy facility from 1955 to 1991.

There was even a bowling alley, Village Lanes, which was originally a roller rink in the 1950s, located near the northwest corner. Many of the businesses began to falter toward the end of the 1980s, however, and in 1993 the owners of the mall decided to sell. For much of this period, University Village was owned by the Tektronix Retirement Investment Fund.

===Modern===
The chairman of QFC, Stuart Sloan, and his business partner Matt Griffin bought the property, and tenants such as those mentioned above began to move out. Barnes &amp; Noble was an anchor tenant after the mid-1990s renovation, but closed at the end of 2011. U-Village no longer has a hardware store, but features upscale national stores such as Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, Banana Republic, and Crate &amp; Barrel instead (as well as related local specialty stores). Despite this, 61% of U-Village merchants are still local. (The Ernst and Pay n&#x27; Save corporate chains went out of business in the 1990s; adjacent QFC still nominally exists, but as a division of Kroger.)

==Shops==
Anchor tenants today are Bartell Drugs (locally owned 1890-2022), Apple Store, Crate &amp; Barrel, The Gap, and Pottery Barn. Significant adjacent anchors are the Seattle QFC flagship store and a large Safeway. In 1991, neighborhood activists initiated a campaign with the City to &quot;daylight&quot; Ravenna Creek through Ravenna Park to Lake Washington, but the segment from the park to the University of Washington (UW) and the Union Bay Natural Area was successfully blocked by the owners of University Village. It has been recently updated to include more shops below the brand new medical center. 

Amazon.com, an online retailer founded and based in the region, opened its first physical storefront at University Village on November 3, 2015.

==Boundaries==
The campus of the UW is to the west and south, the neighborhood of Bryant farther to the east, and the neighborhood of Ravenna to the north, but portions of the surrounding neighborhoods are often referred to as being in &quot;University Village&quot; themselves, approximately west to 22nd Avenue NE, north to NE 55th Street, and east to Union Bay Place NE and 30th Avenue NE.&lt; The area&#x27;s principal arterials are 25th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street; 35th Avenue is a minor arterial. Collector arterials are NE Blakeley-Union Bay Place NE and NE 55th streets.

<doc id="991868" wikidata="Q7827372" url="?curid=991868" title="Torture murder">
<text>A torture murder is a murder where death was preceded by the torture of the victim. In many legal jurisdictions a murder involving &quot;exceptional brutality or cruelty&quot; will attract a harsher sentence.

==Frequency==

Lynching in the United States—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by human trophy collecting. 

In the 21st century, many of the murders of foreigners in and citizens of Iraq and Syria committed by members of the terrorist organization Daesh have been preceded by torture. Film footage of the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar documents the aftermath and testimony of torture murder by government forces, and evidence has linked torture murder with many other massacres, war crimes, and genocides, both contemporary and historical.

==Punishment==
Murder laws worldwide vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions. In the laws of Italy, Germany, Norway, and many parts of the United States, there are two or more &quot;degrees&quot; of murder, with wording such as: &quot;...inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim&#x27;s death&quot; typically used to rule that the highest degree should apply. In other jurisdictions, it may be that even if there was just one crime of murder, the sentencing practices and guidelines are such that the aggravating circumstance of any torture will nevertheless allow for a harsher than normal penalty, up to and including life imprisonment.

Trained at the Arts Educational School and the Royal Ballet School, Bussell began her professional career at Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet. In 1989, at the age of 20, she moved to The Royal Ballet, where she became the youngest-ever principal dancer.

The family spent some time in Australia, where Bussell attended school before they returned to London for Bussell to be educated at Fox Primary School in Kensington.

<text>The Copper River and Northwestern Railway (CR&amp;NW) consisted of two rail lines, the Copper River line and the Northwestern line. Michael James Heney had secured the right-of-way up the Copper River in 1904. He started building the railway from Cordova, Alaska in 1906. The town of Cordova, Alaska, was actually named by Heney on March 13, 1906, based on the original name given by Salvador Fidalgo. Both these railroads were abandoned and little remains of them. A 0-4-0 locomotive, &quot;Ole&quot;, located near Goose City on a siding of the Alaska Anthracite Railroad Company is the only equipment left. Many of the holdings of the CR&amp;NW railroad including Ole were acquired for this railroad by Mr. Clark Davis and his partners in 1908 after a major storm destroyed the Katalla area facilities in 1907. The town of Cordova would like to move Ole to a memorial site in Cordova to celebrate its role in these railroads. Ole was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
In 1905 Myron K. Rodgers received a four-year contract to assist the Guggenheim family with their interests in Alaska. This work consisted of establishing coal claims in the Bering River coal field and building a railroad (Northwestern) to serve them. Myron Rodgers employed his brother Wesley P. Rodgers to carry out the surveys in 1906 and to build the railroad in 1907. The railroad started at Palm Point and extended to the northeast past the town of Katalla towards the coal fields. At Palm Point a loading pier was built into the bay and a branch line for the Copper River railroad was extended west to connect to it. The 1907 winter storm destroyed all of these facilities, including the engine house and support base.

By Oct. 1906, Heney had retired and decided to sell his Copper River right-of-way to the Alaska Syndicate that consisted of M. Guggenheim &amp; Sons and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. However, he returned to work for Daniel Guggenheim on the Copper River railway in 1907 after the destruction of the winter storm. Guggenheim had decided Cordova was a better starting point. The railroad was built by the Kennecott Corporation (now part of the Alaska Syndicate) between 1908 and 1911 to take copper ore from Kennecott, Alaska to Cordova, Alaska, a distance of 315 km (196 mi).

The Alaska Syndicate included investment by J.P. Morgan. He had earlier bought John Rosene&#x27;s Northwestern Commercial Company, an empire of mercantile companies, shipping interests, and railroad. The syndicate started construction from Cordova, the Bonanza mine site at Kennecott, and at a point midway where the Nizina River merged with the Copper River. Challenges included bridging the Kuskulana River canyon and the Copper River with the Million Dollar Bridge. &quot;The completion of the Million Dollar Bridge in the summer of 1910 effectively guaranteed the success of the rail project and the shipment of the first load of Kennecott ore in early 1911.&quot;

Heney had traveled to New York in 1909 to meet with Daniel Guggenheim and other board members about the railroad progress. On his return journey, he departed Seattle on 23 Aug. 1909 aboard the steamship &quot;Ohio&quot;. On 25 Aug., the &quot;Ohio&quot; struck an uncharted rock and sank. Heney finally made it to Cordova on 18 Sept. On 30 Nov. 1909 the railroad reached the Tiekel River, completing the first phase of the contract. Heney made another trip to New York to turn over that portion of the railroad to the Katalla Company. On the return trip he spent the winter in Seattle. His health failing, Heney finally succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis on 4 Oct. 1910.

The last spike in the construction, a &quot;copper spike&quot;, was driven on 29 March 1911, by Chief Engineer E. C. Hawkins and Superintendent Samuel Murchison at Kennicott.

The cost of the railway at $25 million was justified because the mines produced $200 million worth of copper ore during their operation of which at least 50 percent was profit. There were 129 bridges constructed between Cordova and Chitina.

As far as is known, the CR&amp;NW was the only railway in Alaska to employ wigwags at railroad crossings.

The good ore in the mines ran out and the last train ran on 11 Nov. 1938. In 1941, the Kennecott Corporation donated the railroad right-of-way to the United States &quot;for use as a public highway&quot;. In 1953 conversion was started. The Alaska Dept. of Highways had extended the Copper River Highway to Mile 59, from Cordova to the Million Dollar Bridge, by 1964. However, the damage to 28 bridges after the Good Friday earthquake delayed further construction. By 1972 the highway extended to Mile 72 and south 20 miles from Chitina.

The bridge has recently (2005) been repaired. Bridge 339 washed out in 2012 and cut the access to the bridge. The roadbed from Chitina to McCarthy now forms the McCarthy Road.

==Historic designations==

On April 24, 1973, the railway remains, comprising 11 trestles, an abandoned native village with a Russian post and the Tiekel Station, were added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places. The railway&#x27;s bunkhouse and messhouse at Chitina were also added to the register on December 5, 2002. The 0-4-0 tank engine, Number 3, &quot;Ole&quot;, was declared eligible for the National Register in 1988.

==Rolling stock==
By 1936, the company had rostered 13 steam locomotives, 6 passenger cars and 327 freight cars.

<text>Aviation medicine, also called flight medicine or aerospace medicine, is a preventive or occupational medicine in which the patients/subjects are pilots, aircrews, or astronauts. The specialty strives to treat or prevent conditions to which aircrews are particularly susceptible, applies medical knowledge to the human factors in aviation and is thus a critical component of aviation safety. A military practitioner of aviation medicine may be called a flight surgeon and a civilian practitioner is an aviation medical examiner. One of the biggest differences between the military and civilian flight doctors is the military flight surgeon&#x27;s requirement to log flight hours.

==Overview==
Broadly defined, this subdiscipline endeavors to discover and prevent various adverse physiological responses to hostile biologic and physical stresses encountered in the aerospace environment. Problems range from life support measures for astronauts to recognizing an ear block in an infant traveling on an airliner with elevated cabin pressure altitude. Aeromedical certification of pilots, aircrew and patients is also part of aviation medicine. A final subdivision is the AeroMedical Transportation Specialty. These military and civilian specialists are concerned with protecting aircrew and patients who are transported by AirEvac aircraft (helicopters or fixed-wing airplanes).

Atmospheric physics potentially affect all air travelers regardless of the aircraft. As humans ascend through the first 9100–12,300 m (30,000–40,000 ft), temperature decreases linearly at an average rate of 2 °C (3.6 °F) per 305 m (1000 ft). If sea-level temperature is 16 °C (60 °F), the outside air temperature is approximately −57 °C (−70 °F) at 10,700 m (35,000 ft). Pressure and humidity also decline, and aircrew are exposed to radiation, vibration and acceleration forces (the latter are also known as &quot;g&quot; forces). Aircraft life support systems such as oxygen, heat and pressurization are the first line of defense against most of the hostile aerospace environment. Higher performance aircraft provide more sophisticated life support equipment, such as &quot;G-suits&quot; to help the body resist the adverse effects of acceleration, along with pressure breathing apparatus, or ejection seats or other escape equipment.

Every factor contributing to a safe flight has a failure rate. The crew of an aircraft is no different. Aviation medicine aims to keep this rate in the humans involved equal to or below a specified risk level. This standard of risk is also applied to airframe, avionics and systems associated with flights.

AeroMedical examinations aim at screening for elevation in risk of sudden incapacitation, such as a tendency towards myocardial infarction (heart attacks), epilepsy or the presence of metabolic conditions diabetes, etc. which may lead to hazardous condition at altitude. The goal of the AeroMedical Examination is to protect the life and health of pilots and passengers by making reasonable medical assurance that an individual is fit to fly. Other screened conditions such as colour blindness can prevent a person from flying because of an inability to perform a function that is necessary. In this case to tell green from red. These specialized medical exams consist of physical examinations performed by an Aviation Medical Examiner or a military Flight Surgeon, doctors trained to screen potential aircrew for identifiable medical conditions that could lead to problems while performing airborne duties. In addition, this unique population of aircrews is a high-risk group for several diseases and harmful conditions due to irregular work shifts with irregular sleeping and irregular meals (usually carbonated drinks and high energy snacks) and work-related stress.

<text>Daouda Malam Wanké (May 6, 1946 – September 15, 2004) was a military and political leader in Niger. He was a member of the Hausa ethnic group.

Wanké&#x27;s year of birth is disputed. Many sources claim it is 1954 while others suggest 1946.

==Biography==

He was born in Yellou, a town near Niger&#x27;s capital, Niamey. He entered the Niger military, rising to the rank of Major. On April 9, 1999, Wanké led a military coup in which President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara, who himself had come to power in a military coup, was assassinated. For two days there was much political uncertainty in Niger, as the prime minister, Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki and several others also had claims on the presidency. On April 11, 1999, Wanké became president, heading a transitional government that promised to hold elections later that year.

Wanké&#x27;s government fulfilled its promise, and turned over power to the newly elected president, Mamadou Tandja, in December 1999. Wanké subsequently suffered from various health problems, including cardiovascular troubles and high blood pressure. During the last months of his life, he traveled to Libya, Morocco and Switzerland for medical treatment. He died in Niamey. He is survived by a wife and three children.

<doc id="991904" wikidata="Q4177597" url="?curid=991904" title="Terrace (board game)">
<text>Terrace is a strategy game played by two, three, or four players on a multi-leveled 8×8 (or, more recently, 6×6) board. It is most widely known for also being a prop in the American television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. There are also computer versions of the game.

==Rules==
The game board for &quot;Terrace&quot; has either 64 or 36 squares of uniform color, arranged in L-shaped levels (&quot;terraces&quot;) that rise stepwise from the board&#x27;s lowest points in two diagonally opposite corners to its highest points in the other two corners. All pieces are shaped alike and move according to the same rules, but they are of four different sizes and vary in capturing &quot;power.&quot; One of each player&#x27;s smallest pieces has the letter &quot;T&quot; carved into it and has a role somewhat similar to the king in chess.

The object is to win either by moving your &quot;T&quot; piece from its starting point at one corner to an opposite corner, or by capturing your opponent&#x27;s &quot;T&quot;. Players can move any number of squares on the same terrace, and are allowed to jump over their own pieces. Players can move up a terrace by either going straight up or diagonally up. Players can move down a terrace by going straight down. Opponent&#x27;s pieces, and even one&#x27;s own pieces, may be captured by moving diagonally down. Pieces may only capture those of equal or lesser size. It is courteous to say &#x27;Terrace&#x27; when the opponent&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; piece is placed in jeopardy of being caught the next turn; &quot;Terrace-Mate&quot; should be said when the opponent&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; piece cannot escape. In 3 and 4 player games, when a player loses their &quot;T&quot;, all of their pieces are removed from the board; other players continue the game. If a player cannot make a move during their turn, the game is a draw, with no winner or loser.

==History==
The original 8×8 game of &quot;Terrace&quot; was invented in 1950 by Dutch-born Anton Dresden (September 8, 1915 - July 3, 2006), with rules that &quot;proved unworkable&quot;; in 1988, while living in Lake Oswego, Oregon, Dresden showed his game to Buzz Siler, who bought the rights to Dresden&#x27;s design for $100 and, over time, created a simplified set of rules. After the game was introduced in 1991, &quot;Terrace&quot; won a number of major awards and was subsequently featured on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; as a permanent prop.

In 1997, a revised version was introduced, with the board changed to 36 squares, with 12 pieces per player instead of 16. Two rows separate the two players&#x27; pieces, instead of four. The change came about because of legal problems with the owners of the molds to the original version of the game.

<doc id="991916" wikidata="Q2023533" url="?curid=991916" title="Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov">
<text>Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov (; born Mikhail Dimitrov Ivanov []; January 31, 1900 – December 25, 1986) was a Bulgarian philosopher, pedagogue, mystic, and esotericist. A leading 20th-century teacher of Western Esotericism in Europe, he was a disciple of Peter Deunov (Beinsa Douno), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood.

==Life==
Mikhail Dimitrov Ivanov was born in Srpci (then in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire), a village in Bitola Municipality in the present-day North Macedonia, to a Bulgarian family. His father, Ivan Dimitrov established a coal business in Varna, Bulgaria. His mother, Dolya was a religious woman, who dedicated her son to God since his very early childhood. In 1907, she decided that the family should join her husband and they moved to Varna, too. His father died when Aivanhov was seven years old. At the age of 17, after a childhood passed in poverty, he met Master Peter Deunov (1864–1944), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood in the city of Varna, Bulgaria. A few months later in 1918, he followed Master Deunov to the capital, Sofia.
During the early years of his discipleship, Aivanhov was quite poor. He owned a bed, some books, a violin (given to him by Deunov) and a few shabby clothes. He spent most of his time on spiritual retreats in the mountains, where he studied and meditated, occasionally taking a job to earn his keep. Deunov also obliged him to broaden his conventional knowledge by pursuing studies at the University of Sofia, and he enrolled in courses on psychology, education philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy &amp; medicine between 1923 and 1931. From around 1932 to around 1937, he worked as a school teacher and then a high school principal.

In 1937 with the approach of the Second World War, Peter Deunov foresaw that political unrest, war and the spread of communism would lead to a ban on all spiritual associations in Bulgaria and so he entrusted Mikhail Ivanov with bringing his teaching to France. Deunov chose Aivanhov out of 40,000 other students.

On July 22, 1937, he arrived in France penniless, with no knowledge of French and only one contact person in France, Stella Bellemin, a Bulgarian expatriate. However, Aivanhov turned out to be an excellent linguist. He took no money from his students or charged for his lectures apart from one exception when touring America. The money was banked and used later for a publishing project. On January 29, 1938, he gave his first public talk in the Luxembourg Hall, Place de la Sorbonne. This was the first of over 5000 conferences. In 1944 he published his first collection of talks. On January 21, 1948, he was arrested on a false charge and sentenced to 4 years in prison, but in March 1950 he was released.

He taught mainly in France, and he created the spiritual centers Bonfin in Fréjus, France and Izgrev, Sofia in his native Bulgaria, but also traveled a great deal. From 1938 until 1986 he gave some 4,500 talks in French, first of all in France (in Paris and its outskirts, and later at Fréjus in the Var region), and then in Switzerland (spiritual center Videlinata), Canada, the United States, India, Sweden and Norway. He also visited many other countries.

His works which include 44 pocketbooks and 32 complete works are based on his lectures, which were recorded first in shorthand and since 1960 on audio and video tape. Finally, in 1972 his Publishing House Prosveta released several collections of these talks in the form of books and brochures (translated into 30 languages), CDs and DVDs with subtitles.

In 1959, he traveled to India, where he met saint, Neem Karoli Baba, whom Baba Ram Dass/Richard Alpert made famous in North America. Babaji referred to Aivanhov as &#x27;the French Sadhu&#x27; The name Omraam was given to him by three sages who approached Aivanhov while he was in India, meditating and uttered the word &#x27;Omraam&#x27; thereafter he was known as Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov. After this he allowed himself to be called &quot;Master&quot;.

==Central idea==

Aivanhov&#x27;s philosophy teaches that everybody, regardless of race, religion, social position, intellectual ability or material means, is able to take part in the realization of a new period of brotherhood and peace on earth. This happens through the individual&#x27;s personal transformation: growth in perfection and in harmony with the divine world. Whatever the topic, he invariably focuses on how one can better conduct life on earth. Aivanhov taught that to achieve a better life, one must have a high ideal: &quot;... if you have a High Ideal, such as the bringing of the Kingdom of God on earth, you obtain everything you wished for, you taste plenitude.&quot;

==Initiatic science==
Aïvanhov teaches the ancient principles of initiatic science. He describes the cosmic laws governing both the universe and the human being, the macrocosm and microcosm, and the exchanges that constantly take place between them.

This knowledge has taken different forms throughout the centuries. It is the perennial wisdom expressed through various religions, each adapted to the spirit of a particular time, people, and level of spiritual evolution. Aivanhov&#x27;s teaching incorporates aspects of Esoteric Christianity that relate to finding the &quot;Kingdom of God on earth&quot; within the individual. One of the essential truths of initiatic science, according to Aivanhov, is that (in the higher world) all things are linked. Thus committing oneself to the Kingdom of God on earth makes it realizable: &quot;The real science is to form within ourselves, in the depths of our being, this Body that Initiates call the Body of Glory, the Body of Light, the Body of Christ.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Aïvanhov was a pescetarian. He died on December 25, 1986, in Fréjus, France, shortly after receiving French citizenship.

<text>The California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE) was an early exit testing program established under California law (California Education Code Section 48412). Testers who passed the CHSPE received a high school equivalency (HSE) diploma granted by the California State Board of Education. 

All individuals and institutions subject to California law that require a high school diploma are required to accept the CHSPE diploma as requirement fulfillment. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has ruled it acceptable in federal civilian employment applications, and the U.S. Department of Education recognizes the CHSPE as a high school diploma equivalent for various purposes, including financial aid applications. The University of California system accepts the Certificate of Proficiency awarded by the State Board of Education upon successful completion of CHSPE. 

In 2023, the exam program was discontinued and replaced by the California Proficiency Program. This was due to the SAT10, the examination the CHSPE was based on, becoming obsolete and the new CPP being administered by the HiSET and GED.

==Eligibility==
While current enrollment in school was not required, testers had to be at least 16 years old or enrolled in at least two semesters of the 10th grade. Students enrolled in schools outside of California could not register until they were sixteen years of age. Testers had to pay upwards of $230 by the regular registration deadline or more if late, and sit during one or more of the three (two in 2022) exam dates offered a year.

==Structure==
The exam tested individuals based on the high school curriculum in California using a format similar to that of the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT10). Those who had previously taken the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), required of all high school students to graduate in California, found the CHSPE similar in format, but longer in length and with more difficult, rigorous questions.

The CHSPE tests included mathematics and English-Language Arts (reading and writing). The English-Language Arts section included grammar and vocabulary questions, and also asked the examinee to write an essay. The math section assessed students on geometry, algebra, and pre-algebra. Testers had three and a half hours to complete the exam and were free to divide their time as they wished between the two sections.

===Mathematics===
The CHSPE mathematics section had 50 multiple-choice questions broken into 4 content clusters: number sense and operations; patterns, relationships, and algebra; data, statistics, and probability; and geometry and measurement. Testers had to score at least 350 within a range of 250–450 to pass the math section.

===English language arts===
The CHSPE English-language arts section had two subtests of reading and language (writing).

====Reading====
The reading subtest had 84 multiple-choice questions broken into seven content clusters: initial understanding; interpretation; critical analysis; strategies; synonyms; multiple meaning words; and context clues. Testers had to score at least 350 within a range of 250–450 to pass the reading subtest.

====Language with writing====
The language subtest had 48 multiple-choice questions broken into six content clusters: capitalization; usage; punctuation; sentence structure; pre-writing; content and organization, in addition to a writing subtask. Testers had to score at least 350 within a range of 250–450 on the language subtest, in addition to at least a 2.5 within a score range of 1-5 on the writing subtask to pass the English-language arts section.

==CHSPE vs. GED==
The CHSPE was based on the SAT10 and only administered in English, targeted at homeschoolers, students who wanted to legally conclude high school before 18, and/or start college early, such as gifted and talented ed students. Other alumni included entertainment industry or agriculture professionals who preferred to start working at an earlier age.

In contrast, the GED was traditionally only for people over 18 years of age.

In 2023, the CHSPE was replaced with the California Proficiency Program (CPP). The new CPP was to be administered by both the GED and the HiSET. The HiSET was the first to release, in 2023.

==Benefits==
Upon passing the exam, testers receive a legal, high school equivalency certificate and official transcript containing a score report, which can be used to enroll in college early. As with any college enrollment, assessment tests may be required upon college entrance to determine the student&#x27;s ability for placement in the appropriate courses.

Testers under 18 years of age who pass the exam may not leave high school without parent or guardian consent. The CHSPE eliminates the need for minors to get a work permit before being employed, but is not otherwise considered &quot;emancipation,&quot; and laws regulating minors still apply.

<doc id="991922" wikidata="Q2116527" url="?curid=991922" title="Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2">
<text>Between 1911 and 1914, the Royal Aircraft Factory used the F.E.2 (&quot;Farman Experimental 2&quot;) designation for three quite different aircraft that shared only a common &quot;Farman&quot; pusher biplane layout.

The third &quot;F.E.2&quot; type was operated as a day and night bomber and fighter by the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War. Along with the single-seat D.H.2 pusher biplane and the Nieuport 11, the F.E.2 was instrumental in ending the Fokker Scourge that had seen the German Air Service establish a measure of air superiority on the Western Front from the late summer of 1915 to the following spring.

==Design and development==
The Farman Experimental 2 designation refers to three quite distinct designs – all pushers based on the general layout employed by the French aircraft designers, the Farman Brothers – but otherwise completely different aircraft. This &quot;re-use&quot; of the F.E.2 designation has caused much confusion.

===F.E.2 (1911)===

The first F.E.2 was designed by Geoffrey de Havilland at the Royal Aircraft Factory in 1911. Although it was claimed to be a rebuild of the F.E.1, a pusher biplane designed and built by de Havilland before he joined the Factory&#x27;s staff, it was in fact an entirely new aircraft, with construction completed before the F.E.1 was wrecked in a crash in August 1911. The new aircraft resembled the final form of the F.E.1, with no front elevator, but seated a crew of two in a wood and canvas nacelle, and was powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome rotary engine.

It made its maiden flight on 18 August 1911, flown by de Havilland. It was fitted with floats in April 1912, first flying in this form on 12 April 1912, but was underpowered and its engine was therefore replaced by a 70 hp (52 kW) Gnome, this allowed it to take off carrying a passenger while fitted with floats. Later in the year the F.E.2, refitted with a landplane undercarriage, was modified to carry a Maxim machine gun on a flexible mount in the nose.

===F.E.2 (1913)===

The second F.E.2 was officially a rebuild of the first F.E.2, and may indeed have included some components from the earlier aircraft. It was, however, a totally new and much more modern design, larger and heavier than the 1911 aircraft, with the wingspan increased from 33 ft (10.06 m) to 42 ft (12.80 m) and a new, more streamlined nacelle. Loaded weight rose from 1,200 lb (545 kg) to 1,865 lb (848 kg). The new F.E.2 used the outer wings of the B.E.2a, with wing warping instead of ailerons for lateral control, and was powered by a 70 hp Renault engine. It was destroyed when it spun into the ground from 500 ft (150 m) on 23 February 1914, probably because of insufficient fin area. The pilot, R. Kemp, survived the crash, but his passenger was killed.

===F.E.2 (1914)===
Work started on another totally new design in mid-1914, the F.E.2a, specifically intended as a &quot;fighter&quot;, or machine gun carrier – in the same class as the Vickers FB.5 &quot;Gunbus&quot;. Apart from the &quot;Farman&quot; layout it bore no direct relationship with either of the two earlier designs: the outer wing panels were identical with those of the B.E.2c. It was a two-seater with the observer in the nose of the nacelle and the pilot sitting above and behind. The observer was armed with a .303 in Lewis machine gun firing forward on a specially designed, &quot;witches broomstick&quot; mounting that gave it a wide field of fire. The first production order for 12 aircraft was placed &quot;off the drawing board&quot; (i.e. prior to first flight) shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. By this time, the &quot;pusher&quot; configuration was aerodynamically obsolescent, but was retained to allow a clear forward field of fire.

The undercarriage of the &quot;third&quot; F.E.2 was particularly well designed – a small nose wheel prevented nose-overs when landing on soft ground, and the oleo type shock absorbers were also appreciated by crews landing in rough, makeshift fields. In order to reduce weight and drag some of the production aircraft were fitted with a normal &quot;V&quot; type undercarriage. This was not universally popular and when a method was devised of removing the nose wheel in the field without disturbing the shock absorbers, this became the most common form of the F.E.2 undercarriage. The &quot;V&quot; undercarriage remained standard for F.E.2 night bombers, as it permitted the carriage of a large bomb under the nacelle.

The first production batch consisted of 12 of the initial F.E.2a variant, with a large air brake under the top centre section, and a Green E.6 engine. The first F.E.2a made its maiden flight on 26 January 1915, but was found to be underpowered, and was re-engined with a Beardmore 120 hp (89 kW) liquid-cooled inline engine, as were the other eleven aircraft.

The F.E.2a was quickly followed by the main production model, the F.E.2b, again powered by a Beardmore, initially of 120 hp, although later F.E.2bs received the 160 hp (119 kW) model. The air brake of the &quot;a&quot; failed to deliver a worthwhile reduction in the landing run and was omitted to simplify production. The type could also carry an external bomb load, and was routinely fitted with a standard air-photography camera. A total of 1,939 F.E.2bs were built, only a few of them at the Royal Aircraft Factory, as most construction was by private British manufacturers such as G &amp; J Weir, Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd and Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies.

Early in the F.E.2b&#x27;s career, a second Lewis gun was added in front of the pilot&#x27;s cockpit, on a high telescopic mounting so that the pilot could fire forward, over his observer&#x27;s head. In practice, this gun was appropriated by the observers, especially when they discovered that by climbing onto the rim of their cockpits they could fire backwards over the top wing – to some extent overcoming the notorious deficiency of pusher types in rear defence, although even this failed to cover a very large blind spot under the tail. The observer&#x27;s perch was a precarious one, especially when firing the &quot;rear gun&quot;, and he was liable to be thrown out of his cockpit, although his view was excellent in all directions except directly to the rear.
The arrangement was described by Frederick Libby, an American ace who served as an F.E.2b observer in 1916:
The Royal Aircraft Factory was primarily a research establishment and other experiments were carried out using F.E.2bs, including the testing of a generator-powered searchlight attached between two .303 inch (7.7 mm) Lewis guns, apparently for night fighting duties.

The F.E.2c was an experimental night fighter and bomber variant of the F.E.2b, the main change being the switching of the pilot&#x27;s and observer&#x27;s positions so that the pilot had the best view for night landings. Two were built in 1916, with the designation being re-used in 1918 for a similar night bomber version of the F.E.2b, which was used by 100 Squadron. In the end, the observer-first layout was retained for the standard aircraft.
The final production model was the F.E.2d (386 built) which was powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine with 250 hp (186 kW). While the more powerful engine made little difference in maximum speed, especially at low altitude, it did improve altitude performance, with an extra 10 mph at 5,000 ft. The Rolls-Royce engine also improved payload, so that in addition to the two observer&#x27;s guns, an additional one or two Lewis guns could be mounted to fire forward, operated by the pilot.

At least two F.E.2bs were fitted with RAF 5 engines (a pusher version of the RAF 4 engine) in 1916 but no production followed. The F.E.2h was an F.E.2 powered by a Siddeley Puma. The prototype (&quot;A6545&quot;) was converted in February 1918 by Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies, in the hope of producing a night fighter with superior performance. When tested at Martlesham Heath, it proved to be little better than the F.E.2b. Despite this, three more aircraft were converted to F.E.2h standard, these being fitted with a six-pounder (57 mm) Davis gun, mounted to fire downwards for ground attack purposes.

While the F.E.2d was replaced by the Bristol Fighter, the older F.E.2b proved an unexpected success as a light tactical night bomber, and remained a standard type in this role for the rest of the war. Its climb rate and ceiling were too poor for it to make a satisfactory night fighter.

==Operational history==
The F.E.2a entered service in May 1915 with No. 6 Squadron RFC, which used the F.E.2 in conjunction with B.E.2s and a single Bristol Scout. The first squadron to be equipped entirely with the F.E.2 was 20 Squadron, deploying to France on 23 January 1916. At this stage it served as a fighter-reconnaissance aircraft – eventually about ⅔ of the F.E.2s were built as fighters (816) and ⅓ as bombers (395). The F.E.2b and F.E.2d variants remained in day operations well into 1917, while the &quot;b&quot; continued as a standard night bomber until August 1918. At its peak, the F.E.2b equipped 16 RFC squadrons in France and six Home Defence squadrons in England.

On 18 June 1916, German flying ace Max Immelmann was killed in combat with F.E.2bs of No. 25 Squadron RFC. The squadron claimed the kill, but the German version of the encounter is either that Immelmann&#x27;s Fokker Eindecker broke up after his synchroniser gear failed and he shot off his own propeller, or that he was hit by friendly fire from German anti-aircraft guns. In any case, by this time the F.E.2b was at least encountering the German monoplane fighters on more or less even terms and the so-called &quot;Fokker scourge&quot; had ended.

By autumn 1916, the arrival of more modern German fighters such as the Albatros D.I and Halberstadt D.II meant that even the F.E.2d was outperformed and by April 1917, it had been withdrawn from offensive patrols. Despite its obsolescence in 1917, the F.E.2 was still well liked by its crews for its strength and good flight characteristics and it still occasionally proved a difficult opponent for even the best German aces. Rittmeister Baron von Richthofen was badly wounded in the head during combat with F.E.2d aircraft in June 1917 – the Red Baron, like most German pilots of the period, classed the F.E.2 as a &quot;Vickers&quot; type, confusing it with the earlier Vickers F.B.5.

In combat with single-seater fighters, the pilots of F.E.2b and F.E.2d fighters would form what was probably the first use of what later became known as a Lufbery circle (defensive circle). In the case of the F.E.2, the intention was that the gunner of each aircraft could cover the blind spot under the tail of his neighbour and several gunners could fire on any enemy attacking the group. On occasion formations of F.E.2s fought their way back from far over the lines, while under heavy attack from German fighters, using this tactic.

Although outclassed as a day fighter, the F.E.2 proved very suitable for use at night and was used as a night fighter in home defence squadrons on anti-Zeppelin patrols and as a light tactical night bomber. It was first used as a night bomber in November 1916, with the first specialist F.E.2b night bomber squadrons being formed in February 1917. F.E.2bs were used as night bombers in eight bomber squadrons until the end of the First World War, with up to 860 being converted to, or built as bombers. Service as a night fighter was less successful, owing to the type&#x27;s poor climb and ceiling.

F.E.2bs were experimentally fitted with flotation bags for operation over water and were also used to conduct anti-submarine patrols, operating from the Isle of Grain at the mouth of the Thames River.

A total of 35 aircraft derived from the F.E.2 were sold to China in 1919 by Vickers as Vickers Instructional Machines (VIM), to be used as advanced trainers, having a redesigned nacelle fitted with dual controls and powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine.

==Fictional appearances==
Derek Robinson&#x27;s novel &quot;War Story&quot; is about the fictional Hornet Squadron flying the F.E.2b, and later the F.E.2d, giving an account of flying the fighter in the months leading up to the Battle of the Somme. Robert Radcliffe&#x27;s novel &quot;Across the Blood-Red Skies&quot; is narrated by an F.E.2 pilot, and offers an insight into the skills required to fly the aeroplane. William Stanley&#x27;s novel &quot;One Spring in Picardy&quot; is the story of a night-bomber FE2b squadron in France in the spring of 1918. Captain W.E. Johns&#x27; character Biggles starts his operational career in the fictional 169 Squadron, flying the F.E.2b. Grif Hosker&#x27;s five book series about Royal Flying Corps air combat in WWI: &quot;1914&quot;, &quot;1915–Fokker Scourge&quot;, &quot;1916–Angels Over the Somme&quot;, &quot;1917–Eagles Fall&quot;, and &quot;1918–We Will Remember Them&quot;, vividly depict combat from an F.E.2. The protagonist, (a fictional character) Capt Bill Harsker, begins his flying career as an airman gunner in the front of a Vickers Gunbus and advances to become an ace pilot. By the 1917 book, the F.E.2 suffers badly at the hands of the more advanced German aircraft and Harsker converts to a Sopwith.

==Survivors and replicas==

The Royal Air Force Museum London displays an F.E.2b. The wings and tail struts are replicas but the aircraft&#x27;s nacelle and engine are original. The nacelle was made in 1918 by Richard Garrett &amp; Sons, who were subcontracted to make the nacelles for Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd, who assembled the complete aircraft. However, this nacelle was unfinished and never built into a complete aircraft. It was retained by Garretts until 1976 when it was passed to the RAF Museum. In 1986, the museum began a restoration project and commissioned the construction of replica wings and tail; a Beardmore engine was bought in New Zealand in 1992. The lengthy restoration was finally completed and the aircraft put on display in 2009.

Two reproductions of the F.E.2b, one to full airworthiness standards and fitted with a genuine Beardmore engine, have been manufactured by The Vintage Aviator of New Zealand.

<text>The Antelope Valley Press, colloquially referred to as the &quot;Valley Press&quot; or &quot;AV Press&quot; by its staff and Antelope Valley residents, is the largest-circulation daily newspaper in Palmdale, California, United States. 

==Coverage area==
The &quot;Valley Press&quot; covers the fast-growing Antelope Valley, especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. Other areas the &quot;Valley Press&quot; occasionally covers, particularly for aerospace related stories and local high school and college level sports, include the Victor Valley, Bakersfield, and southern San Joaquin Valley areas.

==History==
The &quot;Valley Press&quot; was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915, as the &quot;Palmdale Post&quot;. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the &quot;South Antelope Valley Press&quot;.

It had been a family-owned business since beginning as a weekly newspaper in 1915, until June 30, 2017, when it was assimilated into Canadian publisher Steven Malkowich&#x27;s consortium of holdings.

<text>Mavuradonha (formerly &quot;Mvuradona&quot;) is a range of mountains lying north of Centenary on the Zambezi Escarpment in Northern Zimbabwe. It was declared a protected area in 1987 under the CAMPFIRE programme, and a national monument in 2017. The name in Shona means &#x27;Land of Falling Water&#x27; or simply &#x27;water falls&#x27;. 

The highest point is Banirembizi beacon, at 1613 m.

Visitors can hike the mountainous hills and miombo woodland, and view the many animals and birds. Antelope include sable, eland, kudu, waterbuck and impala. Elephant, baboon, warthog, zebra and leopard are common and lion are occasionally seen. The 290 species of birds include a high density of raptors such as several types of eagles that inhabit the water-berry, mhobohobo, msasa and other brachystegia trees, as well as peregrine falcon. Camping and chalets are available at a site on the main road through the area.

<text>In computing, a class driver is a type of hardware device driver that can operate a large number of different devices of a broadly similar type. Class drivers are very often used with USB based devices, which share the essential USB protocol in common, and devices with similar functionality can easily adopt common protocols.

Instead of having a separate driver for every kind of CD-ROM device, a class driver can operate a wide variety of CD-ROMs from different manufacturers. To accomplish this the manufacturers make their products compatible with a standardized protocol.

In technical terms, a class driver is used as a base or ancestor class for specific drivers which need to have slightly different or extended functionality, but which can take advantage of the majority of the functionality provided by the class driver. This concept is a key aspect of object oriented programming, which when extended to drivers makes it much easier for hardware vendors to provide driver support for their products.

Some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, and Linux distributions in x86 platforms, have included a large number of class drivers.

<text>A county ( or ; the earlier refers to the counties of the Kingdom of Hungary) is the name of a type of administrative unit in Hungary.

This article deals with counties in the former Kingdom of Hungary from the 10th century until the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. For lists of individual counties, see: &quot;Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;. For counties of Hungary since 1950, see: &quot;Counties of Hungary&quot;.

== Nomenclature ==

=== Origin of the name ===
The Latin word is derived from the word , which originally stood for companion or retinue member. In the Early and High Middle Ages, the title was a noble title used in various meanings, in the Kingdom of Hungary especially (but not exclusively) in the meaning &quot;county head&quot;.

The Hungarian word is likely derived from Southern Slavic (, ) meaning approximately territorial border. The Slavic word in turn is related to Latin (middle) through a common Indo-European root. The original word is still used in present-day Slavic languages, i.e. in Slovak (as ), in Slovenian (as ), in Serbo-Croatian (as , ), in a similar sense, and seems to have meant, initially, the border of a county in the Hungarian language. Hungarian has another word () of the same origin meaning borderland.

The Hungarian word (county head) is derived from the Southern Slavic word (), which was used by the Slavs living in the Carpathian Basin before the arrival of the Hungarians and stood for the head of various territorial units. Title was also used as a ruling title in medieval Serbia.

==== vs. county ====
For centuries, the official written language of the Kingdom of Hungary was Latin. The Latin word for the English and Hungarian county, , is sometimes used in English.

==Royal counties (late 10th century – late 13th century)==

===History===
The Hungarians settled in the Carpathian Basin in 895. The first counties were probably the counties situated in present-day northern Pannonia (Transdanubia); they arose before or around 1000. The exact time of the creation of many other counties is disputed, many of them, however, arose not later than during the rule of King Stephen I (1000/01–1038). Initially there were also several small frontier counties (Latin: ), established for military purposes only (e. g. comitatus of Bolondus), which however ceased to exist in the 14th century when royal counties were transformed into noble ones. Initially, there were also some small special castle districts, which ceased to exist in the 13th century.

===Functioning===
Each county was the responsibility of a &quot;county head&quot;, whose seat was a castle – a quasi-capital of the county. The county head was the representative of the king, the judge, and the chief law enforcement officer in his respective territory. He collected the taxes and payments in kind made by the subjects to the king, gave two thirds of them to the king and kept the rest. His castle had special fortifications and was able to withstand even long-term sieges. The sources mention &quot;deputy county heads&quot; in the 12th century for the first time.

The royal county consisted of &quot;castle districts&quot;.

==Noble counties (late 13th century – 1848)==
===History===
In the late 13th century, the royal counties gradually turned into highly autonomous noble counties. The reasons for this development were:
* The arrival of new hospites: hospites were foreign settlers who were allowed to apply their own foreign law in their settlements; particularly Germans and especially after 1242. This considerably restricted the real powers of the county heads, since the hospites were outside their jurisdiction.
* At the end of the 12th century, and even more so in the early 13th century under King Andrew II, large parts of royal territory (i. e. of the kingdom) were donated to the so-called &quot;royal servants&quot; (in the 9th–12th centuries members of certain professions, mostly craftsmen, who were settled in special villages and served the king with their respective skills).
* In the 13th century, the royal servants managed to co-ordinate their activities in order to increase their own powers at the expense of those of the county heads (see also the Golden Bull of 1222) and thus became nobles: servientes regis.

As a result, by royal decrees of 1267, 1290, and 1298, the king could only confirm that the royal counties had turned into noble ones. Nobles (mostly former royal servant families) became quasi-rulers in the counties. The change from a royal to a noble county, however, took place at different times in each county.

In the 15th century, the borders of the counties stabilised and basically remained unchanged until 1920. Between the early 16th century and the late 17th century, however, most of the counties ceased to exist once they became part of the Ottoman Empire (the Turks) or of the Principality of Transylvania. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties &quot;Temesiensis&quot;, &quot;Torontaliensis&quot; and &quot;Krassoviensis&quot; created the special administrative district &quot;Banatus Temesiensis&quot; (Temeswar Banate). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (&quot;Confiniaria militaria&quot;) till the late 19th century.

The bodies of the new counties considerably helped to defend the interests of lower and middle nobility with respect to the oligarchs, who were often the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the kingdom, and with respect to the absolutistic efforts of the Habsburg kings. The counties as noble institutions were abolished only in the course of the Revolution of 1848 by legal articles III–V and XVI/ 1848.
====Transitory period (1785–1790)====
In 1785, king Joseph II decided to abolish the counties as entities of noble autonomy (self-governance) and tried to introduce a new system of absolutist centralized state administration in the Kingdom of Hungary. The kingdom, including Croatia and Slavonia, was primarily divided into 10 newly created military/administrative districts, each of which consisted of four to seven counties. The territory of the counties corresponded to the traditional one, but in 1786 many of them were merged and the counties became pure units of state administration – the &quot;main county heads&quot; were abolished, the county clerks became employees of the state, the courts became the responsibility of the state etc. The capitals of the districts were chosen so as to be situated right in the middle of the district. The number of processus districts was reduced. The official language became German rather than Latin. The districts were headed by a &quot;commissioner&quot; appointed by the Austrian emperor, who was simultaneously also the king of Hungary. After the death of Emperor Joseph II, however, facing strong resistance against any kind of absolutist centralization in Hungary, the new king Leopold II had to repeal all the reforms and the old system of the self-governments of the counties was reinstated in 1790.

===Functioning===
Only the duty to support the king militarily, the territorial unit and formally also the title of &quot;county head&quot; remained from the former royal counties.

The new county was a self-governing (autonomous) entity of lower gentry. It was led by the county head (&quot;comes&quot;), appointed by the king, and by his deputy, appointed by the county head. These two persons were the link between the king and the nobility. As a rule, the county heads (from the 15th /16th century onwards called &quot;main county head&quot;) were the supreme feudal lords of the county. From the beginning of the 14th century, the county head was at the same time the castellan of the respective county castle in 13 counties. People became county heads for a limited period of time and could be recalled by the king, but a number of prelates (from the 15th century also seculars) received the &quot;eternal county leadership&quot; of their diocese.

Note that the formal title &quot;comes&quot; was also borne by some dignitaries of the Court (e. g. &quot;comes curiae&quot;) and other nobles in the Early Middle Ages, and then by other members of middle nobility in the Late Middle Ages, and it did not mean count in these cases.

From the 13th-14th century onwards, the deputy county heads, and not the &quot;county head&quot; himself, were the real administrators of the county. This development was emphasised by the fact that the county heads were also higher dignitaries of the state or of the court at the same time (palatine, treasurer, etc.), so that they did not have much time for the management of the county. The &quot;deputy county head&quot;″s role was to administer the county during the &quot;county head&quot;″s absence. Originally, the deputy county head was a personal employee of the king and thus the main person through which the king exercised influence in the county. At the same time, the deputy was the castellan of the castle of the county head or an economic officer (Latin: &quot;&quot;) of the properties of the same. Initially, the nobles of the county could not influence the appointment of the deputy county head, but in the early 15th century, they managed to put through a rule that only a noble from the same county can become the deputy county head (see below).
Initially, in the 13th century, influence of nobles made itself felt only in the judicial sphere. The judges of the servientes regis - the so-called &quot;iudices servientium&quot; - developed into the &quot;noble judges&quot; (see below), and the courts of the &quot;servientes regis&quot; - the so-called &quot;sedes iudiciaria&quot; or - developed into the county court (the Latin name remained ). The meetings were led by the county head, later de facto by his deputy (see below). Until the 15th century, the county head&#x27;s co-judges were his &quot;deputy county head&quot;, the (usually four) &quot;noble judges&quot;, and a number of persons appointed ad hoc from among the present nobles. From the 15th century onwards, permanent &quot;jurors&quot; were elected from among the nobles of the county. The served as the court of first instance for minor disputes of the nobles and as the appeal instance for village courts and patrimonial courts ().

From the beginning of their existence, the &quot;noble judges&quot; were the real representatives of county autonomy. They were elected by the &quot;congregatio generalis&quot; (see below) and were not only judges, but also political administrators of their respective processus districts (see below). They formed the core of the newly arising class of squires.

Later, the counties even turned to political entities representing the noble autonomy (noble self-government). This evolution started especially under the kings Charles Robert and Louis I. From 1385 onwards, the counties were sending representatives to meetings of the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary and they played a role in the collection and setting of taxes. But only in the early 15th century, the nobles managed to put through a rule that only a noble from the same county can become the deputy county head and a co-judge. From 1504 onwards the deputy county head&#x27;s appointment had to be approved by the nobles (congregatio generalis -see below), so that the deputy county head definitively became the de facto leader of the county. The county head, appointed by the king from the oligarchs (supreme nobility), was only the formal representative of the county.

The county authorities were very powerful and administered all spheres of public life. They were responsible for all inhabitants of the county, except for inhabitants of free royal towns (&quot;liberae regiae civitate&quot;), mining towns, free districts, and at the time of the Anjou kings also of royal castle domains. Until 1486, some members of the supreme nobility were exempt from the jurisdiction of the county, too.

The most important body of self-government of the county was the congregatio generalis, i. e. the county assembly convened and led by the county head. Originally, this body was created and served only as a judicial body, which comprised the judge, the &quot;sedria&quot; members and 8 elected noble &quot;jurors&quot;, and which was usually convened once a year. At the same time, the &quot;inquisitio communis&quot; (hearing of a witness) enabled the nobles to influence the proceedings conducted at the royal curia. Gradually, judicial affairs were excluded from the meetings of the congregatio generalis, which thus turned from a judicial body into an administrative body. All nobles of the county participated in person in the meetings of the congregatio and the congregatio decided on all important political, military and economic affairs.

As from the beginning of the 15th century, the territory of each county was divided into processus each of which was administered by one of the noble judges (there were therefore usually four in each county). The aim was to simplify the administration. The number of processus was increasing from the 18th century onwards, because the functions of the counties were increasing too. The processus, in turn, consisted of 2 to 6 &quot;circuits&quot; (Latin: &quot;circuli&quot;), each of which was the responsibility of a &quot;deputy noble judge&quot;.

Until the 1840s (with an exception in 1785-1790), the official language of county administration was Latin.

In 1840, the deputy county head (&quot;alispán&quot;, Ger. &quot;Vicegespann&quot; or &quot;Vizegespan&quot;) was described as &quot;the personage of the most importance in the county&quot;, having duties similar to an English sheriff but also presiding over the county court of justice. (The &quot;Obergespann&quot;, theoretically his superior, was usually a nobleman, who would commonly be in Vienna or Pesth and thus have little time for local affairs.) Furthermore, the &quot;Vicegespann&quot; presided over the county assembly, which had as late as 1840 a long list of powers, ranging from police regulations to tax, to improvements on bridges and roads.

== State counties (1849–1860) ==

In 1849, in the course of and after the defeat of the Magyars in the 1848-1849 Revolution, the Austrian Habsburgs established a military dictatorship in the Kingdom of Hungary and the counties were turned into simple state administration entities and authorities.

=== 1st provisional arrangement (1849–1850) ===
A provisional centralised administration started to be created by the Austrians in February 1849, Alexander Bach issued a decree on provisional organisation of the Kingdom of Hungary in early August 1849 and a regulation on the administrative system of the Kingdom of Hungary followed on 24 October. Under this regulation:
*Croatia-Slavonia, the Military frontier, Voivodina and the Temes-Banate were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) and directly subordinated to Vienna
*the remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into 5 military districts (in present-day Slovakia: Bratislava, Košice, in the remaining territory: Sopron, Pest-Buda, Oradea) led by generals appointed by the emperor, which in turn were divided into civil districts (around 4 in each military district), the civil districts were divided into counties (with their previous borders) and the counties into districts. German became the official language.

=== 2nd provisional arrangement (so-called Geringer Provisional Arrangement; 13 September 1850 – 18 January 1853) ===
Under a regulation on provisional political administration of the Kingdom of Hungary issued on 13 September 1850, the territory was divided into the above 5 districts (called &quot;civil districts&quot; now), which in turn consisted of counties and the counties of districts. The territories of some counties changed, some counties were newly created. The districts were led by &quot;main district county heads&quot;, the counties by a &quot;chairman&quot; (German:&quot;Vorstand&quot;) and the districts by &quot;noble judges&quot; (German: &quot;Stuhlrichter&quot;).

===&quot;Definitive&quot; arrangement (19 January 1853 – 20 October 1860)===
Only slight changes were made to the previous arrangement. Each district was formally turned to an &quot;administrative territory of a governorship department&quot; (since 1 July 1860: &quot;administrative territory of the branche-offices of the governorship&quot;). Some county territories were slightly modified and they were led by &quot;commissioners&quot;. The only responsibilities of these state counties were political administration and the management of taxes. The courts were the responsibility of other entities.

==Transitory period (1860–1867)==
The situation prevailing before 1848 was restored in October 1860, both in terms of borders and in terms of noble autonomy. In 1863, however, the noble autonomy was replaced by an absolutist system of state administration again.

==Modernised counties (1867–1920)==
=== History ===
After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, in 1868 Transylvania was definitively reunited with the Kingdom of Hungary proper, and the town and district of Rijeka declared autonomous. In 1869, the counties lost the jurisdiction powers (the courts) as royal courts were organized. Modernization of the counties was then realized in two steps.

First, an 1870 act of parliament unified the legal status and internal administrative structures of the various municipal (self-governing) administrative units, abolishing almost all historical privileges. However, this Municipalities Act retained the historical names and officials of the municipalities and did not touch their territories in general, so the territory and names of the counties still largely corresponded to those of the pre-1848 period. However, in addition to the 65 counties (49 in Hungary proper, 8 in Transylvania, and 8 in Croatia), there were 89 cities with municipal rights, including historical royal privileged towns and others, authorised by the 1870 Act, and other types of territorial municipalities (3 in Hungary proper and 18 in Transylvania), including privileged districts, the so-called &quot;seats&quot; of the Székely Land and Transylvanian Saxons and others. Thus, the total number of municipal entities was 175 under direct control of the central Hungarian government, of which about a third was a county.

The main effect of the 1870 Municipalities Act was that it was no longer only the nobles and other privileged groups who could lead the municipalities (see Functioning). The system of districts (historically, in Latin, &quot;&quot;) as administrative sub-divisions was affirmed in counties and extended to other areas.

The second step of modernization was realized in another act of parliament in 1876. This Municipal Territories Act reduced the number of municipalities significantly and made counties the only territorial units by abolishing privileged districts, seats and other forms. 73 counties were organized in place of the 65 counties and 21 other units. However, historical identities were highly considered; in Hungary proper only minor corrections were made. Bigger changes came to Transylvania where the Székely Land and the Saxons&#x27; Land were completely &quot;countified&quot;. At the same time the total number of municipal towns was reduced from 89 to 30.

After 1876 only minor changes were made to the system until 1918. The number of &quot;&quot; districts steadily increased over the next decades, growing from around 400 up to some 450 by 1918. The powers and responsibilities of the counties were constantly decreased and were transferred to ministries in different fields of special administration, like responsibilities in terms of construction, veterinary medicine and (overall) financial management. The ministries controlled these through their own regional and local agencies.

===Functioning===
The main county body was the &quot;municipal committee&quot;, comprising 50% (persons paying the highest direct taxes), and 50% elected persons fulfilling the prescribed census and ex officio members (&quot;deputy county head&quot;, &quot;main notary&quot; and others). The county was led by the &quot;main county head&quot;, who was a government official subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Hungary. The &quot;deputy county head&quot; was also an important function.

<text>Timothy White (January 25, 1952 – June 27, 2002) was an American rock music journalist and editor.

White began his journalism career as a writer for the Associated Press, but soon gravitated towards music writing. He was an editor for the rock magazine &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; in the late 1970s and a senior editor for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in the early 1980s, where he wrote an article detailing the destruction of Bob Hope&#x27;s face in a logging accident when Hope was in his teens, accounting for Hope&#x27;s unusual nose and jaw. 

White was editor-in-chief of &quot;Billboard&quot; beginning in 1991.
 On White’s watch, &quot;Billboard&quot; dramatically revamped its music charts, employing computerized sales data from SoundScan that produced the first statistically precise barometer of consumer tastes. The new charts shocked the industry, showing that fans were often more fascinated by comparatively unknown rap, metal, alternative rock and country acts than pompous superstars.&lt;br&gt; Initially, music companies resisted the change, but the new chart system ultimately altered the way records were manufactured, distributed and marketed. Under White, Billboard also implemented accurate radio airplay charts, using computerized technology that set a new standard for accuracy in the industry. 

White wrote several music-related biographies, including books on the Beach Boys, Bob Marley and James Taylor, as well as several collections of columns and short pieces. 

He also hosted and co-produced a nationally syndicated radio series, &quot;Timothy White&#x27;s Rock Stars/The Timothy White Sessions&quot;.

White remained editor-in-chief of &quot;Billboard&quot; until 2002, when he died of a heart attack. He was 50 years old.

<doc id="991962" wikidata="Q5101060" url="?curid=991962" title="Chinhoyi Caves">
<text>The Chinhoyi Caves (previously the Sinoia Caves) are a group of limestone and dolomite caves in north central Zimbabwe. Designated a National Park in 1955, and managed by the Zimbabwe Parks &amp; Wildlife Management Authority.

==Location==
The caves are located in Makonde District, Mashonaland West Province, in north central Zimbabwe. They lie approximately , by road, northwest of Chinhoyi (formerly Sinoia), the nearest large town, and the location of the district and provincial headquarters. This location lies about , northwest of Harare, the capital. The caves lie on the main road, Highway A-1, between Harare and Chirundu, at the International border with the Republic of Zambia, about , further northwest of the caves.

==Overview==
The cave system is composed of limestone and dolomite. The main cave contains a pool of cobalt blue water, which is popularly called &quot;Sleeping Pool&quot; or &quot;Chirorodziva&quot; (&quot;Pool of the Fallen&quot;). Divers have discovered a submarine passage leading from the &quot;Bat Cave&quot;, a subchamber of the &quot;Dark Cave&quot; to another room known as the &quot;Blind Cave&quot;. Diving is possible in the caves all year round, with temperatures never beyond the range with zero thermocline. Visibility is high, and and above is not unusual. This site is often visited by diving expedition teams of technical divers that perform ultra deep diving. It is not uncommon for dives in excess of to be made here by experienced technical divers. A campsite, run by the National Parks Authority, and a motel are located on-site.

==History==
The local name for the cave&#x27;s pool, &quot;Chirorodziva&quot; (&quot;Pool of the Fallen&quot;) comes from an incident that occurred in 1830, where members of the Angonni tribe attacked the local people and threw their victims into the cave to dispose of them.

The limestone caves were first described by Frederick Courtney Selous in 1888. These caves are the most extensive cave system in Zimbabwe that the public can access.

==Religion==
The caves have an important place in African Traditional Religion, with the caves themselves as a site for rainmaking, surrounded by a sacred forest, from which trees could not be felled.

<text>Moses Barrett III (born July 22, 1973), better known by his stage name Petey Pablo, is an American rapper and record producer from Greenville, North Carolina. He is best known for his 2003 crunk single &quot;Freek-a-Leek,&quot; which peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Prior, he signed with Jive Records to release his 2001 single &quot;Raise Up&quot; (featuring Timbaland), which served as a tribute to his native Greenville and peaked at number 25 on the chart. The label released his first two albums: &quot;Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry&quot; (2001) and &quot;Still Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry&quot; (2004); the former was nominated for Best Rap Album at 45th Annual Grammy Awards, while the latter peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. His following releases have failed to yield any further commercial response.

==Biography==
Born in Greenville, North Carolina, Barrett spent five years in prison for a 1993 armed robbery and upon his release moved to New York City, where he met Black Rob and Busta Rhymes, and, according to rumor, was signed to Jive Records after the A&amp;R director overheard him rapping in a club bathroom.

=== Musical career ===

==== 2001–2002: First album ====
After getting signed to Jive Records, Petey Pablo began working on his debut album. The first single &quot;Raise Up&quot; was released in summer 2001, which was produced by Timbaland. &quot;Raise Up&quot; was helped by rotation on MTV and heavy airplay on urban radio, and reached number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Pablo&#x27;s first album &quot;Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry&quot; peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

==== 2003–2006: Second album, and hiatus ====
In early 2003, &quot;Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. It lost the award to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;. 

Petey Pablo&#x27;s success continued with the release of his second studio album, &quot;Still Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry&quot; which he started working on in 2003. The album was a critical and commercial success, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The lead single off the album, &quot;Freek-a-Leek&quot;, produced by Lil Jon became Petey Pablo&#x27;s biggest hit single of his career by reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Also in 2004, Petey Pablo achieved more mainstream success for his feature on Ciara&#x27;s hit single &quot;Goodies&quot; which topped the Billboard Hot 100. 

After the release of his second studio album, Petey Pablo went on a hiatus from music.

==== 2010–present: Return to music and third studio album ====
After his departure from Jive Records, Petey Pablo founded his own independent label, Carolina Music Group. He released a track in July 2010 entitled &quot;Go&quot;, which was produced by Timbaland. In September 2011, Petey Pablo released a single called &quot;Get Low&quot; on iTunes. 

=== Arrest and incarceration ===
On September 11, 2010, Petey Pablo was arrested at Raleigh-Durham International Airport after trying to carry a stolen 9mm semi-automatic pistol aboard a US Airways flight bound for Los Angeles. On September 26, 2011, he was sentenced to 35 months in prison and entered incarceration at the Federal Correctional Institution (Beckley) on January 4, 2012. He was held at the Federal Correctional Institution (Fort Dix), with a release date of July 17, 2014, but he was released early on March 13, 2014.

On February 17, 2012, Petey Pablo released a mixtape called &quot;Carolina #1&quot; while in prison under the independent newly founded label &quot;Carolina Music Group&quot;. Pablo had also confirmed working on his third studio album &quot;A&amp;R: Anticipated Recordings&quot;, which has yet to have a confirmed release date.

=== Prison release and later music ===
In late 2015 Pablo released a new single titled &quot;Never Imagined&quot;.

On Sunday, January 17, 2016, after the Carolina Panthers&#x27; victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the 2016 NFC Divisional playoffs, Pablo released a new single via Soundcloud and YouTube titled &quot;Carolina Colors&quot;. The single was used as a hype song for the 2016 NFC Championship Game against the Arizona Cardinals.

=== Acting career ===
In 2002, Petey Pablo appeared as himself in the film &quot;Drumline&quot; where he performs &quot;Club Banger&quot;, &quot;You Can Find Me&quot;, &quot;Raise Up&quot;, and &quot;I Told Y&#x27;All&quot;. 
Petey Pablo had a guest appearance in &quot;A Thousand Deaths&quot;, a 2005 episode of &quot;The Shield&quot;. In 2009, Petey Pablo appeared in the film &quot;Just Another Day&quot; where he played B-Bone. In 2015, Petey Pablo played Clyde in the episode &quot;Without a Country&quot; on the show &quot;Empire&quot;, in which his character performed &quot;Snitch Bitch&quot; with Lucious Lyon (played by Terrence Howard) in jail.

<text>The Colne Valley Railway is a heritage railway based at Castle Hedingham Station, near Halstead in Essex, England. The railway consists of a long running line, with a fully reconstructed station, signal box and railway yard.

== History ==
The railway occupies part of the former Colne Valley and Halstead Railway (CVHR), which opened in stages between 16 April 1860 and 10 May 1863. This part of the railway was a through line from to Wakes Colne.

The line closed on 1 January 1962, when all passenger and freight traffic between and ended. On 19 April 1965, all transiting freight traffic ended. The line was dismantled and infrastructure demolished or recovered by contractors a year later, and the land on which the heritage railway station now sits resold to a local landowner.

== Preservation ==
The site was acquired from the landowner in 1973 and the Colne Valley Railway Company Limited formed to operate the railway. A volunteers&#x27; supporters body, the Colne Valley Railway Preservation Society (CVRPS), was formed in 1974. Although originally a main line railway, the track and infrastructure was taken up in the late 60s, so on acquisition there was no remaining infrastructure onsite. The original Sible and Castle Hedingham station away and was taken down carefully brick by brick, the bricks numbered, and the structure transported to the new site and subsequently reconstructed. The timber top half (first floor) of the signal box came from , remounted on a new higher (ground floor) brick base. The bridge crossing the River Colne came from Earls Colne in 1982.

The first steam locomotive to arrive on site was Hunslet &quot;Austerity&quot; 0-6-0ST No.WD190 shortly followed by No.72. Members of the CVRPS began to operate the locomotives on a short section of line. Despite its still short length, presently the CVR is home to three ex-mainline steam locomotives.

== Closure threat ==
CVR Company Limited was acquired by Australian businessman Christopher Young in 2005. The CVRPS agreed a five-year renegotiable lease to take over the operation of the railway for the 2006 season. In 2014, when the 5-year lease expires on 31 December 2015, Young offered the CVRPS the option of buying the site&#x27;s freehold. The CVRPS pursued sufficient funds and loans to complete the terms by December 2015, but were told that Young&#x27;s plans had changed.

The CVRPS were informed at their Annual General Meeting on 22 March 2015 that CVR Co. Ltd. had decided the railway no longer featured in future plans for the site and planning permission would be sought for redevelopment of the site, which lies in a conservation area – a subsequent Freedom of Information request by local media discovered that outline planning permission had been sought for 600 houses on the station. The CVRPS were served notice that operations must cease after 31 December 2015, with the CVRPS having to remove all its rolling stock and buildings during 2016, with possibility of relocation to another heritage railway.

In June 2015, it was announced by Steam Railway magazine that a new site adjacent to the current one had been procured. Permission was being sought from CVR Co. Ltd. to operate as normal during 2016, with the railway operating from the new site from 2017. A new station would be constructed at each end of the line, which would extend to . Later that month, it was announced by Steam Railway magazine that the proposed new site was &quot;no longer viable&quot; due to reasons that were not disclosed.

In September 2015, CVRPS was formally converted into a charity called Colne Valley Railway Preservation Ltd. (CVRPL).

On 6 December 2016 CVRPL announced that the railway, on its original site, was now safe and the site purchased from CVR Co. Ltd. as a result of obtaining a heritage lottery fund grant for £1.75m along with support from Braintree District Council.

<text>Patricia Marie Anthony (March 29, 1947 – July 2, 2013) was an American science fiction and slipstream author. Anthony published her first science fiction novel in 1992 with &quot;Cold Allies&quot;, about the arrival of extraterrestrials in the midst of a 21st-century Third World War. This was followed by &quot;Brother Termite&quot;, &quot;Conscience of the Beagle&quot;, &quot;The Happy Policeman&quot;, &quot;Cradle of Splendor&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Fires&quot;, each of which combined science fiction plots with other genres in unconventional ways. Several of her short-fiction works were republished in the 1998 collection &quot;Eating Memories&quot;.

Anthony&#x27;s best-known and most critically acclaimed work is probably 1993&#x27;s &quot;Brother Termite&quot;, a tale of political intrigue told from the perspective of the leader of extraterrestrials who have occupied the United States. James Cameron acquired the movie rights to &quot;Brother Termite&quot; and John Sayles wrote a script, but the movie has not been produced.

Following her initial success, Anthony taught creative writing at Southern Methodist University for three years, and as her career progressed she moved farther away from the traditional boundaries of the science fiction genre. Her 1998 novel &quot;Flanders&quot;—the highly metaphysical story of an American sharpshooter in the British Army during World War I -- represented a clean break with her science fiction past and her final outing with Ace Books. It was a critical, if not commercial, success.

After the publication of &quot;Flanders&quot;, Anthony ceased writing science fiction to work as a screenwriter, though none of her scripts have been green-lighted. Anthony completed a new novel in 2006, but it remains unpublished.

Anthony lived in Brazil during the 1970s and later drew upon that experience for &quot;Cradle of Splendor&quot;.

<text>Armando Christian Pérez (born January 15, 1981), better known by his stage name Pitbull (also known as Mr. 305 and Mr. Worldwide), is an American rapper, singer and actor. He began his career in the early 2000s as a reggaeton, Latin hip hop, and crunk performer, and signed with TVT Records to release his debut studio album, &quot;M.I.A.M.I.&quot; (2004). Executive produced by Lil Jon, it moderately entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 along with his second and third albums, &quot;El Mariel&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Boatlift&quot; (2007). His fourth album, &quot;Pitbull Starring in Rebelution&quot; (2009), yielded his mainstream breakthrough, spawning the singles &quot;I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)&quot; and &quot;Hotel Room Service&quot;—which peaked at numbers two and eight on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively.

After rebranding himself as a pop artist, Pitbull&#x27;s sixth and seventh albums, &quot;Planet Pit&quot; (2011) and &quot;Global Warming&quot; (2012) were both met with continued commercial success; the former spawned his first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one single &quot;Give Me Everything&quot; (featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer), while the latter spawned the top ten hit &quot;Feel This Moment&quot; (featuring Christina Aguilera). His 2013 single, &quot;Timber&quot; (featuring Kesha), became his second song to peak the chart, and did so in 18 other countries. His 2014 single, &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot; (with Ne-Yo), peaked within the chart&#x27;s top ten and led his eighth album, &quot;Globalization&quot; (2014). That same year, he performed the song &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot; (with Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte), which served as the official theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Pitbull made numerous guest appearances on a number of hit songs, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top four singles &quot;I Like It&quot; by Enrique Iglesias, &quot;DJ Got Us Fallin&#x27; In Love&quot; by Usher, and &quot;On the Floor&quot; by Jennifer Lopez.

His subsequent albums, &quot;Dale&quot; (2015) and &quot;Climate Change&quot; (2017), trailed commercially. His eleventh album and first independent release, &quot;Libertad 548&quot; (2019) focused on Latin hip hop and was led by the singles &quot;No Lo Trates&quot; (with Daddy Yankee and Natti Natasha) and &quot;Me Quedaré Contigo&quot; (featuring Ne-Yo). His twelfth album, &quot;Trackhouse&quot; (2023) delved further into Latin influences.

Pitbull has sold over 25 million studio albums and over 100 million singles worldwide. He has over 15 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020. He was ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the 45th Top Artist of the 2010s and the 24th Top Latin Artist of the 2010s. Pitbull&#x27;s other ventures include brand ambassadorship and for various entities, activism and philanthropy in Latino American communities, a radio station—Pitbull&#x27;s Globalization—on Sirius XM Radio, and ownership of the Trackhouse Racing NASCAR team. As of May 2019, Pitbull has won 35 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards.

==Early life and background==
Armando Christian Pérez was born on January 15, 1981, in Miami, Florida, to Cuban immigrant parents. While growing up, he was strongly encouraged by his family to &quot;take advantage&quot; of the privilege of living in America, and the opportunities that came with it. His family has a history of fighting against the Castro regime in Cuba. When he was three, he could recite the works of Cuban national hero and poet José Martí in Spanish. He learned English by watching &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as a child. His father was largely absent from his childhood; his parents separated when he was young, and he was raised mostly by his mother, later stating: &quot;my mom is my father and my mother.&quot; He briefly stayed with a foster family in Roswell, Georgia. His parents struggled with substance abuse; as a teenager, he was also involved with drug use and dealing, which eventually led to him getting kicked out of the family house. He attended South Miami Senior High School and Miami Coral Park High School. While growing up, he was influenced by the Miami bass genre of pop music and has cited Celia Cruz and Willy Chirino as sources of inspiration, in addition to rappers such as Nas, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. He stated that Miami&#x27;s melting pot characteristics exposed him to various cultures which influenced his artistry and himself as a person.

He said he chose his stage name of Pitbull because the dogs &quot;bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose. And they&#x27;re outlawed in Dade County. They&#x27;re basically everything that I am. It&#x27;s been a constant fight&quot;. After meeting Lil Jon in Miami, Pitbull was featured on Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz&#x27; album &quot;Kings of Crunk&quot; in 2002. Pitbull&#x27;s song &quot;Oye&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; the following year. In addition, Pitbull released several mixtapes, composed of freestyles and remixes of popular rap music. Pitbull also worked with Uncle Luke during his early career, being featured on Luke&#x27;s 2001 album Somethin&#x27; Nasty, including the single &quot;Lollipop&quot; along with Lil&#x27; Zane.

==Career==
===2001–2003: Luke Records and TVT Records===
In 2001, Pitbull was signed to Luther Campbell&#x27;s Luke Records by Jullian Boothe, then the label&#x27;s vice-president of A&amp;R. In 2001, Pitbull was introduced to Robert Fernandez of Famous Artist Music &amp; Management, an independent label and management company specializing in developing artists, by the Diaz Brothers, a producer duo signed to the company. Fernandez &quot;saw the eagerness and hunger he had&quot; and, with the Luke Records deal ending, began working to develop Pitbull. Together they focused on creating a more radio-friendly sound. Fernandez later told HitQuarters: &quot;At that time his music had a lot of verses and took a long time to get into the hook, and so we took time in getting the songs catchier and less on the rap side.&quot; 

Fernandez introduced Pitbull to Lil Jon, hoping to secure the rapper a small guest intro spot on Lil Jon&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Kings of Crunk.&quot; According to Fernandez, Jon took a liking to Pérez and offered him a track on the album; it is called &quot;Pitbull&#x27;s Cuban Ride Out&quot;. This track helped raise the young rapper&#x27;s profile.

=== 2004–2005: &quot;M.I.A.M.I.&quot; ===

In 2004, Pitbull released his debut album &quot;M.I.A.M.I.&quot;, with the lead single being &quot;Culo&quot; produced by Lil Jon and the Diaz Brothers. It peaked at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and No. 11 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Other singles included &quot;Dammit Man&quot;, &quot;Back Up&quot;, &quot;Toma&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s Nasty&quot; (both featuring Lil Jon). He joined the Anger Management Tour, the 2000 hip-hop concert tour headlined by Eminem and 50 Cent. Pitbull also appeared on the Ying Yang Twins&#x27; single &quot;Shake&quot;, which peaked at No.41 on the Hot 100 and No.12 on the rap chart, Adassa&#x27;s chart topping single &quot;Kamasutra&quot; &amp; Twista&#x27;s &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; (#94 Hot 100, No. 20 Rap). Remix album &quot;Money Is Still a Major Issue&quot; was released in November 2005; it included new track &quot;Everybody Get Up&quot;, a duet with hip-hop/R&amp;B group Pretty Ricky.

TVT Records, Pitbull&#x27;s label at the time, and Slip-n-Slide Records disputed over the release of &quot;Welcome to the 305&quot;, an unreleased album by Slip-n-Slide that Pitbull recorded in 2001. A Miami judge ruled that Slip-n-Slide had a legal right to release the album as it was recorded when Pitbull was a Slip-N-Slide artist, and prior to him signing with TVT Records. A US District Court judge affirmed the decision further. TVT was then ordered in March 2007 to pay Slip-n-Slide $9.1 million for attempting to block the album&#x27;s release to record stores and digital download entities.

In 2005, Pitbull and rapper Sean &#x27;Diddy&#x27; Combs co-founded Bad Boy Latino, a subsidiary of Combs&#x27; Bad Boy Records label. It primarily focuses on Latin hip hop, Latin soul, Latin pop and other tropical music and has offices in New York and Miami, Florida. Along with co-founding it, Pérez currently heads the A&amp;R division of the label.

===2006–2007: &quot;El Mariel&quot; and &quot;The Boatlift&quot;===
In January 2006, Pitbull guest-starred in UPN&#x27;s &quot;South Beach&quot;. Pitbull recorded &quot;Nuestro Himno&quot; in collaboration with Wyclef Jean, Carlos Ponce, and Olga Tañón. On &quot;Listennn... the Album&quot;, the debut album by Terror Squad member and Miami radio personality DJ Khaled, Pitbull performed on three singles: &quot;Holla at Me&quot; and &quot;Born-N-Raised&quot; alongside other Southern-based rappers.

He dedicated the album to his father, who died in May that year. Along with the usual party-oriented tracks, Pitbull also included politically themed tracks in &quot;El Mariel&quot;. The album was released on October 31, 2006, and included singles &quot;Bojangles&quot;, &quot;Ay Chico (Lengua Afuera)&quot;, &quot;Fuego&quot;, and duet with Puerto Rican singer Ken-Y, &quot;Dime (Remix)&quot;. &quot;El Mariel&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; independent albums chart and peaked at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the rap chart.

Pitbull&#x27;s third album, titled &quot;The Boatlift&quot;, was released on November 27, 2007, spawned by the single &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; featuring Lloyd on the chorus. Earlier, Pitbull announced that this album would have a more gangsta rap edge than his earlier albums. Subsequent singles included &quot;Go Girl&quot; featuring Trina, and &quot;The Anthem&quot; featuring and produced Lil Jon, that song sampling the hook from the song &quot;El Africano&quot; by Wilfrido Vargas and the beat from the song &quot;Calabria&quot; by Rune RK. &quot;Go Girl&quot; peaked at No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 36 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart; &quot;The Anthem&quot; No. 36 on the Hot 100 and No.11 on the Hot Rap Tracks.

His variety show, &quot;Pitbull&#x27;s La Esquina&quot;, debuted May 2007 and ran through 2009 on the mun2 cable network.

Pitbull also appeared on DJ Laz&#x27; &quot;Move Shake Drop&quot; and DJ Felli Fel&#x27;s &quot;Feel It&quot;.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;Pitbull Starring in Rebelution&quot; and &quot;Armando&quot; ===

<text>James Barney Pollack (July 9, 1938 – June 13, 1994) was an American astrophysicist who worked for NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center.

Pollack was born on July 9, 1938, in New York City, and was brought up in Woodmere, Long Island by a Jewish family that was in the women&#x27;s garment business. He was a valedictorian of his class at Lawrence High School and graduated from Princeton University in 1960. He then received his master&#x27;s in nuclear physics at University of California, Berkeley in 1962 and his Ph.D from Harvard in 1965, where he was a student of Carl Sagan. He was openly gay. Dorion Sagan told how his father came to the defense of Pollack&#x27;s partner in a problem with obtaining treatment at the university health service emergency department.

Pollack specialized in atmospheric science, especially the atmospheres of Mars and Venus. He investigated the possibility of terraforming Mars, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the possibility of nuclear winter since the 1980s with Christopher McKay and Sagan. The work of Pollack et al. (1996) on the formation of giant planets (&quot;core accretion paradigm&quot;) is seen today as the standard model.

He explored the weather on Mars using data from the Mariner 9 spacecraft and the Viking mission. On this he based ground-breaking computer simulations of winds, storms, and the general climate on that planet. An overview of Pollack&#x27;s scientific vita is given in the memorial talk &quot;James B. Pollack: A Pioneer in Stardust to Planetesimals Research&quot; held at an Astronomical Society of the Pacific 1996 symposium.

He was a recipient of the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize in 1989 for outstanding lifetime achievement in the field of planetary science. Pollack died at his home in California in 1994 from a rare form of spinal cancer, at age 55.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor.

<doc id="992026" wikidata="Q2872179" url="?curid=992026" title="Australian Rugby Shield">
<text>The Australian Rugby Shield is a rugby union competition in Australia. It was launched in 2000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), now Rugby Australia (RA). The competition was intended to unearth new talent outside of the existing rugby strongholds of Sydney and Brisbane. The competition was suspended after the 2008 season, but has since been revived.

The tournament was an important step in the development of rugby union in Australia, and provided an opportunity for Rugby Australia to identify and unearth talented players nationally. It provided regional teams and developing unions with a regular schedule to compete against each other at a higher level than would normally be possible within their individual states or territories.

Conducted under rules and regulations similar to the Super Rugby, the competition aimed to assist players, coaches, managers and referees in their professional development. It provided a pathway to full representative level including education in coaching, selecting and refereeing.

== History ==
The Australian Rugby Shield was first contested in 2000, with six teams playing a single round robin over five weekends and the top two teams playing in the final. The teams in the inaugural season were the Adelaide Black Falcons, Darwin Mosquitoes, Melbourne Axemen, New South Wales Country Cockatoos, Perth Gold, and Queensland Country Heelers. The New South Wales and Queensland Country teams met in the final, played as the curtain-raiser to the Bledisloe Cup match held at Stadium Australia in front of a record rugby crowd of 109,874. Queensland Country won in an upset, 23-17.

New South Wales Country went on to win the next two titles, before Perth claimed their first Australian Rugby Shield in 2003.
A first-past-the-post system was put in place in 2004, eliminating the requirement for a final. In 2006, two additional teams were added, the Tasmania Jack Jumpers and the ACT &amp; Southern NSW Vikings team that won the Australian Rugby Shield on their first attempt. The competition was split into two pools in a three-week round robin competition with the winners and runners up in each pool progressing to the semi-finals (27 May 2006) and cross-pool Final (3 June 2006). Contracted Super Rugby and academy players were excluded.

In 2007, the tournament reverted to a 6-team home-and-away round-robin tournament, without Perth and the Vikings. These two teams were excluded as the ARU determined that the local competitions were sufficient to foster talent for the new Australian Rugby Championship teams, the Perth Spirit and Canberra Vikings, respectively.

At the end of 2008, and citing the difficult economic environment, the ARU declared that the 2009 Australian Rugby Shield would be suspended. The involvement of the Australia A team in the Pacific Nations Cup was also cancelled.

=== NRC Division 2 (2018−2020) ===
An Emerging States Championship was formed in 2018 for representative teams from smaller rugby unions within Australia. There had been no regular competition for these teams since the demise of Australian Rugby Shield a decade earlier. The new tournament was hosted by Rugby Union South Australia in Adelaide and featured the South Australia Black Falcons, Victoria Country Barbarians, Northern Territory Mosquitoes and Tasmania Jack Jumpers. The Black Falcons were the inaugural winners. The tournament was rebranded as NRC Division 2 for 2019, with eight representative teams invited:
* New South Wales Country Cockatoos
* Northern Territory Mosquitoes
* Perth Gold
* Queensland Country Heelers

* South Australia Black Falcons
* South Australian U23
* Tasmania Jack Jumpers
* Victoria Country Barbarians


=== Revival of the Competition ===
During the coronavirus pandemic, Rugby Australia suffered severe economic hardship, nearing bankruptcy. These financial issues were quickly turned around by a new board and led to the reintroduction of the Australian Rugby Shield and Australia ‘A’ competitions from the 2022 season.

Held in Adelaide, teams participated from ACT &amp; Southern New South Wales, New South Wales Country, Outback Queensland, Queensland Country, Rugby Tasmania, Rugby Victoria &amp; Rugby Western Australia.

The ACT and Southern New South Wales Griffins were crowned champions defeating NSW Country 34–31 in the Grand Final at Brighton Oval, Adelaide.

The 2022 Australian Rugby Shield also had a women&#x27;s competition, with Victoria defeating all who stood before them.

Following the conclusion of the 2022 edition, Rugby Australia came under scrutiny for not promoting the competition enough, resulting a lack of awareness in the rugby community it was taking place. Critics did praise the return of the competition as a whole, calling it a significant step in growing rugby union in regional areas.

== Television coverage ==
From 2000 to 2008, the competition was broadcast on national television by the digital channel ABC2. It showcased two of the Australian Rugby Shield matches each round.

In 2022, games were only available to watch via YouTube. This contributed to the criticism that Rugby Australia received in relation to the lack of the promotion this tournament received.

<text>The Bulkley River in British Columbia is a major tributary of the Skeena River. The Bulkley is long with a drainage basin covering .

Much of the Bulkey is paralleled by Highway 16. It flows west from Bulkley Lake past Perow and is joined near Houston by the Morice River, its major tributary. The Bulkley continues north past Quick, Telkwa and Smithers. It then meets the Skeena River near Hazelton. The Bulkley River is a major tourist destination for anglers targeting wild steelhead.

The river was originally called &quot;Wet&#x27;sinkwha&quot; (&quot;blue and green river&quot;) by the Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en people, the indigenous inhabitants of the Bulkley Valley. The name Bulkley was given for Colonel Charles S. Bulkley, the U.S. Army engineer-in-charge of the survey team who, in 1866, explored the area in preparation for the failed Russian American Telegraph. The project was abandoned because of the success of the trans-Atlantic cable in 1866.

The Little Bulkley, a smaller stream running through Houston, and the Morice join just west of Houston. At the point of their joining they become the Bulkley, not the Morice, although the Morice is larger. This was done by Poudrier, a government cartographer who, it is rumoured, never saw the region.

<text>Luke Kelly (17 November 1940 – 30 January 1984) was an Irish singer, folk musician and actor from Dublin, Ireland. Born into a working-class household in Dublin city, Kelly moved to England in his late teens and by his early 20s had become involved in the folk music revival there. Returning to Dublin in the 1960s, he became a founding member of the band The Dubliners in 1962. The &quot;Irish Post&quot; and other commentators regard Kelly, known for his distinctive singing style and sometimes political messages, as one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest folk singers.

==Early life==
Luke Kelly was born to Luke Kelly and Julia Fleming, a working-class couple, in Sheriff Street, Dublin. His maternal grandmother Elizabeth McDonald, who emigrated to Ireland from Scotland, lived with the Kelly family until her death in 1953. Kelly&#x27;s father, who was also named Luke, was wounded as a child when a detachment of soldiers from the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers opened fire on a Dublin crowd on 26 July 1914 in what became known as the Bachelor&#x27;s Walk massacre. He was taken to Jervis Street Hospital with a bullet wound to the lung and, although not expected to recover, he overcame his injuries.

After growing up, Kelly&#x27;s father worked for most of his adult life at a Jacob&#x27;s biscuit factory and enjoyed playing football. The elder Luke was a keen singer: Luke junior&#x27;s brother Paddy later recalled that &quot;he had this talent...to sing negro spirituals by people like Paul Robeson, we used to sit around and join in – that was our entertainment&quot;. After Dublin Corporation demolished Lattimore Cottages in 1942, the Kellys became the first family to move into the St. Laurence O’Toole flats, where Luke spent the bulk of his childhood, although the family were forced to move by a fire in 1953 and settled in the Whitehall area. Both Luke and Paddy played club Gaelic football and soccer as children.

Kelly left school at thirteen and after a number of years of odd-jobbing, he went to England in 1958. Working at steel fixing with his brother Paddy on a building site in Wolverhampton, he was apparently sacked after asking for higher pay. He worked a number of odd jobs, including a period as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Describing himself as a beatnik, he travelled Northern England in search of work, summarising his life in this period as &quot;cleaning lavatories, cleaning windows, cleaning railways, but very rarely cleaning my face&quot;.

==Musical beginnings==
Kelly had been interested in music during his teenage years: he regularly attended céilithe with his sister Mona and listened to American vocalists including: Fats Domino, Al Jolson, Frank Sinatra and Perry Como. He also had an interest in theatre and musicals, being involved with the staging of plays by Dublin&#x27;s Marian Arts Society.

The first folk club he came across was in the Bridge Hotel, Newcastle upon Tyne in early 1960. Having already acquired the use of a banjo, he started memorising songs. In Leeds he brought his banjo to sessions in McReady&#x27;s pub. The folk revival was under way in England: at the centre of it was Ewan MacColl who scripted a radio programme called &quot;Ballads and Blues&quot;. A revival in the skiffle genre also injected a certain energy into folk singing at the time.

Kelly started busking. On a trip home he went to a &quot;fleadh cheoil&quot; in Milltown Malbay on the advice of Johnny Moynihan. He listened to recordings of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. He also developed his political convictions which, as Ronnie Drew pointed out after his death, he stuck to throughout his life. As Drew also pointed out, he &quot;learned to sing with perfect diction&quot;.

Kelly befriended Sean Mulready in Birmingham and lived in his home for a period. Mulready was a teacher who was forced from his job in Dublin because of his communist beliefs. Mulready had strong music links; a sister, Kathleen Moynihan was a founder member of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, and he was related by marriage to Festy Conlon, the County Galway whistle player. Mulready&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ned Stapleton, taught Kelly &quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot;. During this period he studied literature and politics under the tutelage of Mulready, his wife Mollie, and Marxist classicist George Derwent Thomson: Kelly later stated that his interest in music grew parallel to his interest in politics.

Kelly bought his first banjo, which had five strings and a long neck, and played it in the style of Pete Seeger and Tommy Makem. At the same time, Kelly began a habit of reading, and also began playing golf on one of Birmingham&#x27;s municipal courses. He got involved in the Jug O&#x27;Punch folk club run by Ian Campbell. He befriended Dominic Behan and they performed in folk clubs and Irish pubs from London to Glasgow. In London pubs, like &quot;The Favourite&quot;, he would hear street singer Margaret Barry and musicians in exile like Roger Sherlock, Seamus Ennis, Bobby Casey and Mairtín Byrnes.

Luke Kelly was by now active in the Connolly Association, a left-wing grouping strongest among the emigres in England, and he also joined the Young Communist League: he toured Irish pubs playing his set and selling the Connolly Association&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Irish Democrat&quot;. By 1962 George Derwent Thomson had offered him the opportunity to further his educational and political development by attending university in Prague. However, Kelly turned down the offer in favour of pursuing his career in folk music. He was also to start frequenting Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger&#x27;s Singer Club in London.

==The Dubliners==
In 1961 there was a folk music revival or &quot;ballad boom&quot;, as it was later termed, in waiting in Ireland. The Abbey Tavern sessions in Howth were the forerunner to sessions in the Hollybrook, Clontarf, the International Bar and the Grafton Cinema. Luke Kelly returned to Dublin in 1962. O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s Pub was already established as a session house and soon Kelly was singing with, among others, Ronnie Drew and Barney McKenna. Other early people playing at O&#x27;Donoghues included The Fureys, father and sons, John Keenan and Sean Og McKenna, Johnny Moynihan, Andy Irvine, Seamus Ennis, Willy Clancy and Mairtin Byrnes.

A concert John Molloy organised in the Hibernian Hotel led to his &quot;Ballad Tour of Ireland&quot; with the Ronnie Drew Ballad Group (billed in one town as the Ronnie Drew &quot;Ballet&quot; Group). This tour led to the Abbey Tavern and the Royal Marine Hotel and then to jam-packed sessions in the Embankment, Tallaght. Ciarán Bourke joined the group, followed later by John Sheahan. They renamed themselves The Dubliners at Kelly&#x27;s suggestion, as he was reading James Joyce&#x27;s book of short stories, entitled &quot;Dubliners&quot;, at the time. Kelly was the leading vocalist for the group&#x27;s eponymous debut album in 1964, which included his rendition of &quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot;. Barney McKenna later noted that Kelly was the only singer he&#x27;d heard sing it to the rhythm it was played on the fiddle.

In 1964 Luke Kelly left the group for nearly two years and was replaced by Bobby Lynch and John Sheahan. Kelly went back to London with Deirdre O&#x27;Connell, founder of the Focus Theatre, whom he was to marry the following year, and became involved in Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;gathering&quot;. The Critics, as it was called, was formed to explore folk traditions and help young singers. During this period he retained his political commitments, becoming increasingly active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Kelly also met and befriended Michael O&#x27;Riordan, the General Secretary of the Irish Workers&#x27; Party, and the two developed a &quot;personal-political friendship&quot;. Kelly endorsed O&#x27;Riordan for election, and held a rally in his name during campaigning in 1965. In 1965, he sang &#x27;The Rocky Road to Dublin&#x27; with Liam Clancy on his first, self-titled solo album.

Bobby Lynch left The Dubliners, John Sheahan and Kelly rejoined. They recorded an album in the Gate Theatre, Dublin, played the Cambridge Folk Festival and recorded &quot;Irish Night Out&quot;, a live album with, among others, exiles Margaret Barry, Michael Gorman and Jimmy Powers. They also played a concert in the National Stadium in Dublin with Pete Seeger as special guest. They were on the road to success: Top Twenty hits with &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot; and &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1968 and a tour of New Zealand and Australia. The ballad boom in Ireland was becoming increasingly commercialised with bar and pub owners building ever larger venues for pay-in performances. Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger on a visit to Dublin expressed concern to Kelly about his drinking.

As an actor, Kelly performed in the 1969 Dublin Theatre Festival, playing the role of Sergeant Kite in &quot;The Mullingar Recruits&quot;. He later played King Herod in several runs of the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre.

Christy Moore and Kelly became acquainted in the 1960s. During his Planxty days, Moore got to know Kelly well. In 1972 The Dubliners themselves performed in &quot;Richard&#x27;s Cork Leg&quot;, based on the &quot;incomplete works&quot; of Brendan Behan. In 1973, Kelly took to the stage performing as King Herod in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

The arrival of a new manager for The Dubliners, Derry composer Phil Coulter, resulted in a collaboration that produced three of Kelly&#x27;s most notable performances: “The Town I Loved So Well”, &quot;Hand me Down my Bible&quot;, and “Scorn Not His Simplicity”, a song about Phil&#x27;s son who had Down Syndrome. Kelly had such respect for the latter song that he only performed it once for a television recording and rarely, if ever, sang it at the Dubliners&#x27; often boisterous events.

His interpretations of “On Raglan Road” and &quot;Scorn Not His Simplicity&quot; became significant points of reference in Irish folk music. His version of &quot;Raglan Road&quot; came about when the poem&#x27;s author, Patrick Kavanagh, heard him singing in a Dublin pub, and approached Kelly to say that he should sing the poem (which is set to the tune of “The Dawning of the Day”). Kelly remained a politically engaged musician, becoming a supporter of the movement against South African apartheid and performing at benefit concerts for the Irish Traveller community, and many of the songs he recorded dealt with social issues, the arms race and the Cold War, trade unionism and Irish republicanism, (&quot;The Springhill Disaster&quot;, &quot;Joe Hill&quot;, &quot;The Button Pusher&quot;, &quot;Alabama 1958&quot; and &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; all being examples of his concerns).

==Personal life==
Luke Kelly married Deirdre O&#x27;Connell in 1965, but they separated in the early 1970s. Kelly spent the last eight years of his life living with his partner Madeleine Seiler, who is from Germany.

==Final years==
Kelly&#x27;s health deteriorated in the 1970s. Kelly himself spoke about his problems with alcohol. On 30 June 1980 during a concert in the Cork Opera House he collapsed on the stage. He had already suffered for some time from migraines and forgetfulness – including forgetting what country he was in whilst visiting Iceland – which had been ascribed to his intense schedule, alcohol consumption, and &quot;party lifestyle&quot;. A brain tumour was diagnosed. Although Kelly toured with the Dubliners after enduring an operation, his health deteriorated further. He forgot lyrics and had to take longer breaks in concerts as he felt weak. In addition following his emergency surgery after his collapse in Cork, he became more withdrawn, preferring the company of Madeleine at home to performing. On his European tour he managed to perform with the band for most of the show in Carre for their &quot;Live in Carre&quot; album. However, in autumn 1983 he had to leave the stage in Traun, Austria and again in Mannheim, Germany. Shortly after this, he had to cancel the tour of southern Germany, and after a short stay in hospital in Heidelberg he was flown back to Dublin.

After another operation he spent Christmas with his family but was taken into hospital again in the New Year, where he died on 30 January 1984. Kelly&#x27;s funeral in Whitehall attracted thousands of mourners from across Ireland. His gravestone in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, bears the inscription: &quot;Luke Kelly – Dubliner&quot;.

Sean Cannon took Kelly&#x27;s place in The Dubliners. He had been performing with the Dubliners since 1982, due to the deterioration of Kelly&#x27;s health.

==Legacy==
Luke Kelly&#x27;s legacy and contributions to Irish music and culture have been described as &quot;iconic&quot; and have been captured in a number of documentaries and anthologies.

The influence of his Scottish grandmother was influential in Kelly&#x27;s help in preserving important traditional Scottish songs such as &quot;Mormond Braes&quot;, the Canadian folk song &quot;Peggy Gordon&quot;, Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Parcel of Rogues&quot;, &quot;Tibbie Dunbar&quot;, Hamish Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Come-All-Ye&quot;, and Thurso Berwick&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Breakaway&quot;.

The Ballybough Bridge in the north inner city of Dublin was renamed the Luke Kelly Bridge, and in November 2004 Dublin City Council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. However, the Dublin Docklands Authority subsequently stated that it could no longer afford to fund the statue. In 2010, councillor Christy Burke of Dublin City Council appealed to members of the music community including Bono, Phil Coulter and Enya to help build it.

Paddy Reilly recorded a tribute to Kelly entitled &quot;The Dublin Minstrel&quot;. It featured on his &quot;Gold And Silver Years&quot;, &quot;Celtic Collections&quot; and the &quot;Essential Paddy Reilly&quot; CD&#x27;s. The Dubliners recorded the song on their &quot;Live at Vicar Street&quot; DVD/CD. The song was composed by Declan O&#x27;Donoghue, the Racing Correspondent of &quot;The Irish Sun&quot;.

At Christmas 2005 writer-director Michael Feeney Callan&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Luke Kelly: The Performer&quot;, was released and soon acquired platinum sales status. The documentary told Kelly&#x27;s story through the words of the Dubliners, Donovan, Ralph McTell and others and featured full versions of rarely seen performances such as the early sixties&#x27; &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. A later documentary, &quot;Luke Kelly: Prince of the City&quot;, was also well received.

In September 1988 a monument was erected to commemorate Kelly in the Larkhill area of Whitehall, where he had lived.

Two statues of Kelly were unveiled in Dublin in January 2019, to mark the 35th anniversary of his death. One, a life-size seated bronze by John Coll, is on South King Street. The second sculpture, a marble portrait head by Vera Klute, is on Sheriff Street. The Klute sculpture was vandalised on several occasions in 2019 and 2020, in each case being restored by graffiti-removal specialists.

<text>The Whole Earth &#x27;Lectronic Link, normally shortened to The WELL or The Well, is a virtual community that was launched in 1985. It is one of the oldest continuously operating virtual communities. By 1993 it had 7,000 members, a staff of 12, and gross annual income of $2 million. A 1997 feature in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine called it &quot;The world&#x27;s most influential online community.&quot; In 2012, when it was last publicly offered for sale, it had 2,693 members. It is best known for its Internet forums, but also provides email, shell accounts, and web pages. Discussion topics are organized into conferences that cover broad areas of interest. User anonymity is prohibited.

==History==
The WELL was started by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant in 1985. The name follows the naming of some of Brand&#x27;s earlier projects, including the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. Initially The WELL was owned 50% by The Point Foundation, publishers of the Whole Earth Catalog and Whole Earth Review, and 50% by NETI Technologies Inc. a Vancouver-based company of which Larry Brilliant was at that time chairman. Its original management team—Matthew McClure, soon joined by Cliff Figallo and John Coate—collaborated with its early users to foster a sense of virtual community. McClure, Coate and Figallo were all veterans of the 1970s commune called The Farm.

John Coate left the WELL to help create SFGate, the San Francisco Chronicle&#x27;s first web site. In 1991 Figallo hired Gail Ann Williams as a community manager. Williams, one of the principals of the satirical group the Plutonium Players, had been working in nonprofit theater management and was already an active member of the WELL.

In 1992 Cliff Figallo also left his job at The WELL and long time WELL member Maurice Weitman was hired as general manager. Figallo&#x27;s resignation letter to the Board cited changes in company approach: &quot;I am too much identified with the permissive and accommodating attitude that has been part of The Well&#x27;s growth to preside over a more restrictive régime.&quot;

From 1994 to 1999 The WELL was owned by Bruce R. Katz, founder of Rockport, a manufacturer of walking shoes. Katz upgraded the infrastructure and hired staff, but alarmed members with plans to franchise the WELL. &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was a communications mismatch,&quot; Howard Rheingold wrote.

The WELL was a California-run enterprise in 1998 and before.

In April 1999 it was acquired by &quot;Salon&quot;, several of whose founders, such as Scott Rosenberg, had previously been regular participants there. Wired reported, &quot;The surprise move... gives Salon a dose of new credibility by tying it directly into a members-only community of scores of artists, writers, thinkers, scientists, programmers, and visionaries.&quot;

In August 2005 Salon announced that it was looking for a buyer for The WELL, to concentrate on other business lines. In November 2006, a press release from The WELL said &quot;As Salon has not found a suitable purchaser, it has determined that it is currently in the best interest of the company to retain this business and has therefore suspended all efforts to sell The WELL.&quot;

In June 2012 Salon once again announced that it was looking for a buyer for The WELL as its subscriber base &quot;did not bear financial promise&quot;. Salon also announced that it had entered into discussions with various parties interested in buying the well.com domain name and that the remaining WELL staff had been laid off at the end of May. The community pledged money to take over The WELL itself and rehire important staff.

In September 2012, Salon sold The WELL to a new corporation, The WELL Group Inc., owned by eleven investors who were all long-time members. The sale price was reported to be $400,000. Members have no official role in the management, but &quot;can ... go back to what they do best: conversation. And complaining about the management.&quot; The CEO was Earl Crabb, a programmer and supporter of the Bay Area folk music community, who died on February 20, 2015. No announcement was made as to his successor.

== Technology and Structure ==
The original hardware for the WELL was a VAX 11/750, which cost &quot;a quarter of a million dollars and required a closet full of telephone lines and modems.&quot; The WELL&#x27;s core conferencing software, PicoSpan, is written in the C programming language and runs on Unix. PicoSpan was written by Marcus D. Watts for Network Technologies International (NETI). A license for PicoSpan, in exchange for a half interest in the company, was part of NETI&#x27;s initial investment in The WELL (along with the VAX computer running the mt Xinu variant of Unix). In 1996, the WELL began also using and licensing the &quot;Engaged&quot; conferencing software, which was built on top of PicoSpan and provides a Web-based user interface which requires less technological expertise from users. The Wall Street Journal was among the websites reported to use Engaged for online community.

The WELL&#x27;s conferencing system is organized into forums reflecting member interests, and include arts, health, business, regions, hobbies, spirituality, music, politics, games, software and many more. These community forums, known as conferences, are supervised by conference hosts who guide conversations and may enforce conference rules on civility and/or appropriateness. Initially all hosts were selected by staff members. In 1995, Gail Ann Williams changed the policies to enable user-created forums. Participants can create their own independent personal conferences—either viewable by any WELL member or privately viewable by those members on a restricted membership list—on any subject they please with any rules they like. Public conferences are open to all members, while private conferences are restricted to a list of users controlled by the conference hosts. Some &quot;featured private&quot; or &quot;private independent&quot; conferences (such as &quot;Women on the WELL&quot; and &quot;Recovery&quot;) are listed in the WELL&#x27;s directory and members may request admission to such conferences. Within the conferences, logged-in members can see the real name of the author of each post. The intent is to foster a more intimate community through &quot;people taking responsibility for opinions, obsessions, insights, silliness, and an occasional faux pas.&quot;

Women form a large percentage of the WELL&#x27;s user community, and play strong leadership roles. &quot;[A]lthough women made up only 10 percent of people going online, they constituted 40 percent of the population on the WELL.&quot;

Initially, in 1985, the WELL was a dial-up bulletin board system (BBS) influenced by EIES. Access to the WELL was via computer modem and phone line, then, when the internet opened to commercial traffic in the 1990s, the WELL became one of the original dial-up gateway ISPs to provide access to it. Over time, web technology evolved and support for dial-up access was dropped. Today users access the WELL via SSH or the web.

In addition to its conferencing services, the WELL also provided access to the Unix operating system for people who didn&#x27;t have access to an institutional or corporate computer network, and management encouraged members to make and share Unix tools. This was described by early community manager John Coate as an early expression of what would later be called &quot;maker culture.&quot; Reflecting back on that era in 1993, Howard Rheingold said that these factors made it an attractive environment for &quot;young computer wizards.&quot;

==Policy and governance==
Many early writings about the WELL stress members’ attempts to test utopian forms of self-government in the online community. Kevin Kelly recalled the original goal was for the WELL to be cheap, open-ended, self-governing and self-designing. Cliff Figallo said the &quot;exercise of free speech and assembly in online interaction is among the most significant and important uses of electronic networking,&quot; and hoped that the WELL would be a grass-roots alternative to &quot;electronic consumer shopping malls.&quot; But members were shaken in 1990 when one popular and active member &quot;scribbled&quot; (deleted) all his posts, then died by suicide, despite other members’ attempts to reach out to him. A few years later, two members involved in a messy real-life relationship posted about it across several conferences, dividing the community and ultimately becoming a central narrative device for Katie Hafner&#x27;s book about the WELL. &quot;People who had to live with each other, because they were all veteran addicts of the same social space, found themselves disliking one another,&quot; Howard Rheingold wrote.

In retrospect, Gail Ann Williams said the &quot;cyber utopianism&quot; of the founders may have always been overly optimistic. Although the ideal was egalitarian and democratic, the early pricing structure charged users based on their time spent connected to the service, which might have allowed wealthier users to dominate the conversations in what Williams called a &quot;postocracy.&quot; Thomas Valovic, then a research manager with International Data Corporation and adjunct faculty at Northeastern University, theorized that a &quot;single articulate and entertaining person&quot; might be able to steer a discussion through &quot;sheer number of postings,&quot; and that this tactic could be used effectively to spread propaganda: &quot;The same, of course, is true of other online systems.&quot; Valovic also noted that this early pricing structure gave an edge to people whose work subsidized their time on the WELL. For journalists whose work encouraged them to be online, the distinction between public and private discourse became blurred in WELL conversations, and it was not always easy to tell when people were speaking in their official roles: &quot;[...]the online environment has a way of homogenizing work and play to the point that separating the two becomes increasingly difficult.&quot; The WELL&#x27;s utopianism was also challenged by its sale to Bruce Katz, whose vision for the company was more corporate. In her 1994 essay, “Pandora&#x27;s Vox,” WELL member Carmen Hermosillo observed that by posting her thoughts and feelings where an online platform could profit from them, &quot;I had commodified myself.&quot;

On the other hand, during a panel at the 1994 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Figallo reported that &quot;encouraging the formation of core groups of users who shared their desire for minimal social disruption&quot; had been generally successful in promoting free discussion without the need for heavy-handed intervention by management. Looking back in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, Stewart Brand said, &quot;Communes failed, drugs went nowhere, free love led pretty directly to AIDS. ... But the counterculture approach to computers – which was of great ingenuity and great enthusiasm, and great disinterest in either corporate or government approaches to their problems – absolutely flourished, and to a large extent created the Internet and the online revolution.&quot;

Stewart Brand&#x27;s original member agreement was, &quot;You Own Your Own Words&quot; or “YOYOW”). Gail Ann Williams recalled the phrase had a number of different interpretations: In an era when it was uncertain how laws applied to online content, Brand intended it to place legal responsibility for posts on the people who wrote them, she said. But “a lot of people saw it as being about property, that it was about copyright, and other people saw it as meaning you have to own up to your words, if you say something heinous, it won&#x27;t go away, you&#x27;re going to have to live it down.&quot; Currently, the agreement notes members have both the rights to their posted words and the responsibility for those words. Members can also delete their posts at any time, but a placeholder indicates the former location and author of a deleted or &quot;scribbled&quot; post, as well as who deleted it.

== Cultural impact ==

The WELL&#x27;s influence online has been significant (see Katie Hafner&#x27;s 1997 article, &quot;The Epic Saga of the WELL&quot;.) Howard Rheingold noted that both Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, and Craig Newmark, who founded Craigslist, were WELL members before founding their companies. Frequent in-person meetings of WELL members have also been an important facet of The WELL. Monthly WELL Office Parties began in September 1986 and continued for many years thereafter, in the Bay Area and elsewhere. Looking back at the early years, journalist Jon Carroll wrote, &quot;Suddenly there were chili cook-offs and outings to ballgames and brunches and evenings of song... .&quot;&quot;

=== The Berkeley Singthing ===
The &quot;Berkeley Singthing,&quot; a casual gathering to play and sing popular music, is perhaps the longest running of the in-person gatherings of WELL members. Started in 1991, and taking its name from the Berkeley conference in the WELL where it was originally organized it is one of the many ways that WELL members connect in the physical world.

=== &quot;AOL for Deadheads&quot; ===
Sociologist Rebecca Adams noted that “Deadheads were electronic pioneers long before it became fashionable to use the Internet or populate the World Wide Web,” with Grateful Dead-related Usenet forums predating the creation of the first WELL conference for Deadheads on March 1, 1986. Musician David Gans, who was hosting an hour of Grateful Dead music on a San Francisco radio station, launched the conference with Bennett Falk and Mary Eisenhart as co-hosts. The creation of the Grateful Dead conference led to a &quot;growth spurt&quot; in the number of WELL members, and in the early years, Deadheads who used its conferences to make plans, trade audiotapes or discuss lyrics were the largest source of revenue for the WELL. Matthew McClure, part of the WELL&#x27;s original management team, recalled: “The Deadheads came online and seemed to know instinctively how to use the system to create a community around themselves... Suddenly our future looked assured.” By 1997, Eric F. Wybenga&#x27;s almanac of Grateful Dead resources said the WELL &quot;is to Deadheads what AOL is to the average American online.&quot;

=== The Electronic Frontier Foundation ===
The WELL was the forum through which Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore, and Mitch Kapor, the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, first met. Barlow wrote that a visit from an FBI agent investigating the theft of some Apple code made him aware how little law enforcement understood the Internet, and even though he was able to persuade the agent he was not involved in the case, he became concerned about the potential for overreach. EFF was formed in 1990 and Mike Godwin, also a WELL member, was hired as the first on-staff attorney. Barlow and Kapor hosted the EFF conference on the WELL, which discussed topics related to free speech and internet regulation. Godwin helped publicize flaws in a notorious early study of pornography on the Internet, which had led to calls for legislative censorship.

=== Craigslist ===
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark joined the WELL shortly after moving to San Francisco in 1993, and was inspired by members’ discussions about internet community, as well as by examples of members offering other members time and professional help without compensation. In 1995, he started sending out an email list of events and job opportunities to friends. Even after this list expanded to a public LISTSERV and incorporated as a for-profit, Newmark said he viewed it as a community trust and emphasized, &quot;The purpose of the Internet is to connect people to make our lives better.&quot;

=== Salon ===
Salon.com was founded in the wake of the San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994 by a group of journalists that included WELL members. &quot;The Well [sic] is where a lot of us got our first experience online,&quot; Salon co-founder Scott Rosenberg wrote. &quot;In Salon&#x27;s formative days in 1995 we actually used a private conference [on the WELL] to plan our launch.&quot; Salon hired WELL management team member Cliff Figallo in 1998 and WELL conference host Mary Elizabeth Williams to direct its online community, Table Talk. After Salon purchased the WELL in 1999, WELL community manager Gail Ann Williams (no relation) became a Salon employee.

=== Kevin Mitnick hacking case ===
In 1995, Tsutomu Shimomura noticed some of his stolen software had been stored in a WELL account. He worked with WELL management to track and identify hacker Kevin Mitnick as the culprit. This effort was described in Shimomura&#x27;s book &quot;Takedown&quot;, which he wrote with John Markoff, and in a Wired article excerpted from the book.

=== Media coverage of the internet and online community ===
The WELL was described in the early 1990s as a &quot;listening post for journalists,&quot; with members who were staff writers and editors for the New York Times, Business Week, the San Francisco Chronicle, Time, Rolling Stone, Byte, Harper&#x27;s, and the Wall Street Journal. This early visibility may have been helped by the early policy of providing free accounts for interested journalists and other select members of the media. Notable journalists who have written about their experiences on the WELL include John Seabrook of the New Yorker, Katie Hafner of the New York Times, Wendy M. Grossman of the Guardian, and Jon Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle.

==In the news==
In March 2007, The WELL was noted for refusing membership to Kevin Mitnick, and refunding his membership fee.

The WELL also received numerous awards in the 1980s and 1990s, including a Webby Award for online community in 1998, and an EFF Pioneer Award in 1994.

== Virtual community and social network difference ==
There is often confusion between a virtual community and social network. They are similar in some aspects because they both can be used for personal and professional interests. A social network offers an opportunity to connect with people one already knows or is acquainted with. Facebook and Twitter are social networks. Platforms such as LinkedIn and Yammer open up communication channels among coworkers and peers with similar professions in a more relaxed setting. Often social media guidelines are in place for professional usage so that everyone understands what is suitable online behavior. Using a social network is an extension of an offline social community. It is helpful in keeping connections among friends and associates as locations change. move. Each user has their own spider web structure which is their social network.

Virtual communities differ in that users aren&#x27;t connected through a mutual friend or similar backgrounds. These groups are formed by people who may be complete strangers but have a common interest or ideology. Virtual communities connect people who normally wouldn&#x27;t consider themselves to be in the same group. These groups continue to stay relevant and maintained in the online world because users feel a need to contribute to the community and in return feel empowered when receiving new information from other members. Virtual communities have an elaborate nest structure because they overlap. Yelp, YouTube, and Wikipedia are all examples of a virtual community. Companies like Kaiser Permanente launched virtual communities for members. The community gave members the ability to control their health care decisions and improve their overall experience. Members of a virtual community are able to offer opinions and contribute helpful advice. Again, the difference between virtual communities and social network is the emergence of the relationship.

The WELL distinguished itself from the technology of the time by creating a networked community for everyone. Users were responsible and owned the content posted, a rule created to protect the information from being copyrighted and commoditized.

<text>Anatol Borisovich Rapoport (; ; May 22, 1911January 20, 2007) was an American mathematical psychologist. He contributed to general systems theory, to mathematical biology and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion.

==Biography==
Rapoport was born in Lozova, Kharkov Governorate, Russia (in today&#x27;s Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine) into a secular Jewish family. In 1922, he moved to the United States, and in 1928 became a naturalized citizen. He started studying music in Chicago and continued with piano, conducting and composition at the Vienna Hochschule für Musik where he studied from 1929 to 1934. However, due to the rise of Nazism, he found it impossible to make a career as a pianist.

He shifted his career into mathematics, completing a Ph.D. in mathematics under Otto Schilling and Abraham Adrian Albert at the University of Chicago in 1941 on the thesis &quot;Construction of Non-Abelian Fields with Prescribed Arithmetic&quot;. According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, he was a member of the American Communist Party for three years, but quit before enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1941, serving in Alaska and India during World War II.

After the war, he joined the Committee on Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago (1947–54), publishing his first book, &quot;Science and the Goals of Man&quot;, co-authored with semanticist S. I. Hayakawa in 1950. He also received a one-year fellowship at the prestigious Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.

From 1955 to 1970, Rapoport was Professor of Mathematical Biology and Senior Research Mathematician at the University of Michigan, as well as founding member, in 1955, of the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI) at the University of Michigan. In 1970, during the Vietnam War, Rapoport moved to Toronto &quot;to live in a country that was not committed to a messianic role—a small peaceful country with no aspiration to major power status&quot;. He was appointed professor of mathematics and psychology at the University of Toronto (1970–79). The university appointed him professor emeritus in 1980. He lived in bucolic Wychwood Park overlooking downtown Toronto, a neighbour of Marshall McLuhan. On his retirement from the University of Toronto, he became director of the Institute of Advanced Studies (Vienna) until 1983.

University of Toronto appointed him professor of peace studies in 1984, a position he held until 1996, but continued to teach until 2000.

In 1984 he co-founded Science for Peace, was elected president and remained on its executive until 1998.

In 1954 Anatol Rapoport co-founded the Society for General Systems Research, along with the researchers Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Ralph Gerard, and Kenneth Boulding. He became president of the Society for General Systems Research in 1965.

Anatol Rapoport died of pneumonia in Toronto. He was survived by his wife Gwen, daughter Anya, and sons Alexander and Anthony.

==Work==
Rapoport contributed to general systems theory, to mathematical biology, and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion. He combined his mathematical expertise with psychological insights into the study of game theory, social networks, and semantics.

Rapoport extended these understandings into studies of psychological conflict, dealing with nuclear disarmament and international politics. His autobiography, &quot;Certainties and Doubts: A Philosophy of Life&quot;, was published in 2001. An article celebrating his legacy and thinking includes a career overview alongside testimonials by scholars and family that provide a glimpse of Anatol Rapoport, the scientist and the person.

Philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge called Rapoport a polymath whose work Bunge found congenial because of its applicability to real-life problems, its use of mathematics, and its &quot;avoidance of holistic blabber&quot;.

===Game theory===
Rapoport had a versatile mind, working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory, social network analysis, and peace and conflict studies. For example, he pioneered in the modeling of parasitism and symbiosis, researching cybernetic theory. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation.

Among many other well-known books on fights, games, violence, and peace, Rapoport was the author of over 300 articles and of &quot;Two-Person Game Theory&quot; (1966) and &quot;N-Person Game Theory&quot; (1970). He analyzed contests in which there are more than two sets of conflicting interests, such as war, diplomacy, poker, or bargaining. His work led him to peace research, including books on &quot;The Origins of Violence&quot; (1989) and &quot;Peace, An Idea Whose Time Has Come&quot; (1993).

In the 1980s, he won a computer tournament which was based on Robert Axelrod&#x27;s &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot; and was designed to further understanding of the ways in which cooperation could emerge through evolution. The contenders had to present programs that could play iterated games of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma and these were pitted against each other. Rapoport&#x27;s entry, Tit-for-Tat, has only four lines of code. The program opens by cooperating with its opponent. It then plays exactly as the other side played in the previous game. If the other side defected in the previous game, the program also defects; but only for one game. If the other side cooperates, the program continues to cooperate. According to &quot;Peace Magazine&quot; author/editor Metta Spencer, the program &quot;punished the other player for selfish behaviour and rewarded her for cooperative behaviour—but the punishment lasted only as long as the selfish behaviour lasted. This proved to be an exceptionally effective sanction, quickly showing the other side the advantages of cooperating. It also set moral philosophers to proposing this as a workable principle to use in real life interactions.&quot;

His children report that he was a strong chess player but a bad poker player because he non-verbally revealed the strength of his hands.

===Social network analysis===
Rapoport was an early developer of social network analysis. His original work showed that one can measure large networks by profiling traces of flows through them. This enables learning about the speed of the distribution of resources, including information, and what speeds or impedes these flows—such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, proximity, and kinship. This work linked social networks to the diffusion of innovation, and by extension, to epidemiology. Rapoport&#x27;s empirical work traced the spread of information within a school. It prefigured the study of degrees of separation by showing the rapid spread of information in a population to almost all—but not all—school members (see references below). His work on random nets predates the random graphs as defined by the Erdős–Rényi model and independently by Edgar Gilbert.

Rapoport is also the originator of the theory behind the interpretation of bias in social networks, which pertains to the extent to which a network deviates from a random base model. He introduced what is now known as &quot;preferential attachment mechanism&quot; in biased networks. It is a stochastic process that involves connected nodes that snowball into more connections. Rapoport also published an article that outlined a probabilistic approach to animal sociology, which is one of the earliest efforts at modeling simple social structures.

===Conflict and peace studies===
According to Thomas Homer-Dixon in the &quot;Toronto Globe and Mail&quot;, Rapoport &quot;became anti-militarist quite soon after World War II. The idea of military values became anathema&quot;. He was a leading organizer of the first teach-ins against the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan, a model that spread rapidly throughout North America. He told at a teach-in: &quot;By undertaking the war against Vietnam, the United States has undertaken a war against humanity…This war we shall not win&quot;. (&quot;Ann Arbor News&quot;, April 1967). He said he was an abolitionist, rather than a total pacifist: &quot;I&#x27;m for killing the institution of war&quot;. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. As a result of his opposition to the Vietnam War, J.Edgar Hoover considered Rapoport a Communist, and organized FBI agents to write letters to the president of the University of Michigan, the Governor of Michigan and others. This smear campaign drove him from Ann Arbor to the University of Toronto.

Rapoport returned to the University of Toronto to become the founding (and unpaid) Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies programme, working with George Ignatieff and Canada&#x27;s Science for Peace organization. As its sole professor at the start, he used a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to the study of peace, integrating mathematics, politics, psychology, philosophy, science, and sociology. His main concern was to legitimize peace studies as a worthy academic pursuit. The Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies continued to flourish at the University of Toronto under the leadership of Thomas Homer-Dixon, and, from 2008, under Ron Levi. When Rapoport began, there was one (unpaid) professor and twelve students. In 2007, there were three paid professors and ninety students.

Rapoport&#x27;s students report that he was an engaged and inspiring professor who captured their attention, imagination and interest with his wide-ranging knowledge, passion for the subject, good humor, kind and generous spirit, attentiveness to student concerns, and animated teaching style.

In 1981 Rapoport co-founded the international non-governmental organization Science for Peace. He was recognized in the 1980s for his contribution to world peace through nuclear conflict restraint via his game theoretic models of psychological conflict resolution. He won the Lentz International Peace Research Prize in 1976. Professor Rapoport was also a member of the editorial board of the &quot;Journal of Environmental Peace&quot; published by the International Innovation Projects at the University of Toronto.

<text>NGC 7320 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Pegasus. It was discovered on 27 September 1873 by French astronomer Édouard Stephan.

NGC 7320 is a member of Stephan&#x27;s Quintet, however, it is not an actual member of the galaxy group, but a much closer line-of-sight galaxy at a distance of about 40 million light years, the same as the nearby NGC 7331. Other galaxies of Stephan&#x27;s Quintet are some 300 million light-years distant. 

NGC 7320 has extensive H II regions, identified as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring.

The galaxy was imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope as part of Stephan&#x27;s Quintet; the picture was released on 12 July 2022.

<doc id="992047" wikidata="Q643180" url="?curid=992047" title="Bodmin and Wenford Railway">
<text>The Bodmin Railway is a heritage railway at Bodmin in Cornwall, England. Its headquarters are at Bodmin General railway station and it connects with the national rail network at .

The original line was opened in 1887 and 1888. Passenger trains were withdrawn in 1967 and freight traffic in 1983. Heritage trains started to operate in 1990. Most of the trains are typical of those that have operated in Cornwall and west Devon.

==History==

The Cornwall Railway was authorised to construct a branch from its Plymouth to Falmouth main line but lack of funds prevented this. When the main line did open in 1859 the town of Bodmin was only served by Bodmin Road station which was nearly away. An independent Bodmin and Cornwall Junction Railway was authorised in 1864 to construct the branch but again, a lack of funds prevented the work.

The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened a branch line from Bodmin Road as far as its Bodmin station on 27 May 1887 and completed it on 3 September 1888 to where it connected with the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway (B&amp;WR). This had opened a line from its own Bodmin station to in 1834, although by 1888 it was operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). This gave Wadebridge access to the main line for the first time as the LSWR&#x27;s own route from Exeter through did not open until 1895.

Boscarne Junction gave the GWR access to the mineral branch line to Wenford. The principal traffic in later years was china clay which was mostly shipped out through south coast ports such as Fowey and Par, even though this required three reversals (at Boscarne, Bodmin and Bodmin Road).

Passenger services were withdrawn by British Rail (BR) on 30 January 1967 but freight continued to Wadebridge until 2 September 1978 and to Wenford until 3 October 1983. Before that happened, a siding had been opened at the Walker Lines Industrial Estate (near Bodmin General on the line to Bodmin Road) for Fulford Trumps who suppliers of agricultural equipment.

===As a heritage railway===
The Great Western Society leased the engine shed at Bodmin General from 1969. Its GWR 1361 Class locomotive 1363 was kept there and sometimes gave trips around the station area but was moved to their headquarters at Didcot Railway Centre in 1982.

After freight traffic ceased a Bodmin Railway Preservation Society was formed in 1984, their aim being to reopen the whole of the GWR line to Boscarne Junction. Shares were issued by the Bodmin and Wenford Railway plc in 1985 to finance the purchase and restoration of the line. The Cornish Steam Locomotive Society moved their trains from the Imperial Dry at Bugle to Bodmin in 1987. The North Devon Diesel Group brought their locomotives in 1988 but relocated to in 2008.

A Light Railway Order was granted in 1989. Services started on 17 June 1990 between Bodmin General and Bodmin Parkway (the new name of Bodmin Road since 1983) and a new station was opened at on 17 April 1992. The line to Boscarne Junction reopened on 14 August 1996.

A workshop was erected at Bodmin General in 1987 using a structure moved from St Austell. A replica of the original signal box was built in 1997 and a two-road engine shed built in 1999 where the original one-road shed had been. A new shed was erected at Bodmin Parkway in 2007 to provide more under-cover storage for rolling stock.

The siding at Walker Lines was used from December 1989 until July 1991 for freight traffic dispatched by the Fitzgerald Lighting Company. Trains were worked to Bodmin Parkway by Bodmin and Wenford Railway diesel locomotives where they were handed over to British Rail. Traffic was resumed in September 1996 with English, Welsh and Scottish Railway providing the main line haulage but ceased in July 2001 when EWS closed their wagonload network.

===Proposed extensions===
The Bodmin and Wenford Railway wanted to reopen the Wenford branch so that china clay could be moved from Wenfordbridge by rail. A separate company, Bodmin and Wenford Rail Freight Limited, was set up in 1992 but the line was not reopened. There were objections from cyclists as the route was now the Camel Trail cycle route and the china clay drier closed in 2002.

Attention has since changed to the route from Boscarne Junction towards Wadebridge, although this is also alongside the Camel Trail. The Bodmin and Wenford Rail Freight company was renamed as the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway Company Limited in 2004 to facilitate this scheme. Initially referred to as &#x27;The Wadebridge Trailway&#x27; it became the &#x27;RailTrail&#x27; project in 2008. It was supported by the North Cornwall District Council but only by a single casting vote. There were objections from cyclists, environmentalists and some residents of Wadebridge. A bid for government funding was made in 2020.

£54,000 funding was secured from the Great Western Railway in 2019 to build a second platform at Bodmin General. This would allow the railway to operate additional trains.

==Route==
The railway is long and climbs about on gradients as steep as 1 in 37.

Located at , from Bodmin General.

Opened by the Cornwall Railway in 1859 as &#x27;Bodmin Road&#x27;, it was rebuilt when the Bodmin line opened in 1887. It was renamed &#x27;Bodmin Parkway&#x27; in 1983. Trains to Bodmin depart from their own platform on the north side of the station. A siding at the west end connects the Bodmin line with the main line, movements being controlled from a ground frame. Just outside the station the Bodmin line crosses the River Fowey on a viaduct.

Located at , from Bodmin General.

This platform, on the east side of the line, was opened in 1992 to serve Bodmin Farm Park which has since closed but it also gives access to Cardinham Woods.

Located at .

This is the headquarters of the Bodmin and Wenford Railway. The original platform is on the west side of the line with the station buildings at the end beyond the buffer stop. The Great Western Railway engine shed and signal box were demolished in the late 1970s but replacements have been built, the signal box being a replica of the original. A workshop has also been built on the site once occupied by the goods shed.

Located at , from Bodmin General.

The junction was the site of exchange sidings from 1888. A small wooden platform was provided from 1964 to allow passengers to connect with a shuttle service to . A new stone platform was built for the heritage trains in 1996. The Camel Trail runs along the north side of the site.

==Rolling Stock==
Most of the locomotives operating on the Bodmin and Wenford Railway are Great Western Railway steam locomotives and British Rail diesels typical of those that have operated in Cornwall and west Devon. There are also shunting locomotives typical of military and industrial sites in the area including &quot;Alfred&quot; and &quot;Judy&quot;, two low height s which were specially constructed by W. G. Bagnall for the Port of Par.

Passenger trains are mostly formed from British Rail Mark 1 coaches but some Great Western Railway coaches are also used.

Heritage goods wagons include several examples of open wagons that had been built by British Rail to carry china clay in Cornwall. Other wagons are used to maintain the railway and its equipment. The oldest item is a ganger&#x27;s pump trolley dating from when the London and South Western Railway owned the Bodmin and Wadebridge line. It used to be kept in a shed at Dunmere Junction.

<doc id="992052" wikidata="Q639891" url="?curid=992052" title="Man-eating plant">
<text>A man-eating plant is a fictional form of carnivorous plant large enough to kill and consume a human or other large animal. The notion of man-eating plants came about in the late 19th century, as the existence of real-life carnivorous and moving plants, described by Charles Darwin in &quot;Insectivorous Plants&quot; (1875), and &quot;The Power of Movement in Plants&quot; (1880), largely came as a shock to the general population, who believed it was impossible for plants to consume animals or move under their own power. Authors began to exaggerate these abilities for dramatic effect, causing the proliferation of fiction about such plants.

==The Madagascar tree==
The earliest known report of a man-eating plant originated as a literary fabrication written by journalist Edmund Spencer for the &quot;New York World&quot;. Spencer&#x27;s article first appeared in the daily edition of the &quot;New York World&quot; on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later. In the article, a letter was published by a purported German explorer named &quot;Karl Leche&quot; (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a human sacrifice performed by the &quot;Mkodo tribe&quot; of Madagascar: This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; of 27 October 1874, where it gained even greater notoriety. Describing the tree, the account related:

The slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.

The hoax was given further publicity by &quot;Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree&quot;, a book by Chase Osborn, who had been a Governor of Michigan. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged &quot;I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world.&quot;

In his 1955 book, &quot;Salamanders and other Wonders&quot;, science author Willy Ley determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: &quot;The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe.&quot;

==Yateveo==
In James W. Buel&#x27;s &quot;Sea and Land&quot; (1889), the &quot;Yateveo&quot; plant is described as being native to Africa and South America, so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase (), and having poisonous &quot;spines&quot; that resemble &quot;many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe&quot; which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach.

==The vampire vine==
William Thomas Stead, editor of &quot;Review of Reviews,&quot; published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found in &quot;Lucifer&quot; magazine, describing a plant in Nicaragua called by the natives the devil&#x27;s snare. This plant had the capability &quot;to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch.&quot; According to the article:

Mr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal&#x27;s cries came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers... The native servants who accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which they call &quot;the devil&#x27;s snare&quot;, and were full of stories of its death-dealing powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass or refuse then dropped.

An investigation of Stead&#x27;s review determined no such article was published in the October issue of &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and concluded that the story in &quot;Review of Reviews&quot; appeared to be a fabrication by the editor. The story in fact appeared in the September issue, preceded by a longer version in an 1889 newspaper describing Dunstan as a &quot;well-known naturalist&quot; from New Orleans.

<doc id="992061" wikidata="Q1939858" url="?curid=992061" title="List of administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary">
<text>The following lists show the administrative divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown (1000–1920) at selected points of time. The names are given in the main official language used in the Kingdom at the times in question.

For details on the functioning and development of the counties and some other administrative divisions see Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary.

==Notes==
This article does not show all states of administrative divisions that existed throughout the centuries, only the major ones. Especially for the medieval period, various sources often give slightly different divisions. Also, the lists of the individual points of time stem from different sources so that the first-level categorization is not necessarily compatible over time.

==1038==
==Around 1074==
Around 1074, the whole Kingdom of Hungary consisted of some 45–50 counties. The existence of many of them is disputed for this time period.

===Counties===
===Frontier counties===
The following castles are assumed to have been seats of frontier counties (&quot;marchiae&quot;, &quot;határispánságok&quot;), it is probable that other castles were such seats as well (ordered from the north to the south):

* in present-day Slovakia: Bratislava (at that time: Bresburc/ Preslawaspurch/Poson), Hlohovec (at that time: Golguc/Golgoc), Trenčín (at that time: Treinchen), Beckov (at that time: Blundus), Nitra (at that time: Nitria), Šintava (at that time: Sempte), Gemer Castle (at that time: Gomur), Zemplin Castle (at that time: Zemněn, Zemlyn)
* in present-day Ukraine: Uzhhorod (Ungvár), Borsova
* in present-day Hungary: Moson Castle, Sopron, Novum Castrum (Hungarian at that time: Újvár), Borsod Castle, Vasvár, Karakó (near Jánosháza), Zalavár (called Kolon at that time)
* present-day Romania: Dobaca (Hungarian: Doboka), Alba Iulia (Hungarian: Gyulafehérvár), Cluj-Napoca (Hungarian: Kolozsvár), Satu Mare (Hungarian: Szatmárnémeti), Timișoara (Hungarian: Temesvár), Turda (Hungarian: Torda)
* present-day Croatia: Vukovar (Hungarian: Valkóvár)
* present-day Serbia: Belgrade (Hungarian at that time: Fehérvár), Stara Palanka (Hungarian: Haram (Krassó)), Kovin (Hungarian: Kéve)

==15th century==
In the late 14th and in the 15th century there were around 70 counties, out of which 7(?) under the voivodship of Transylvania (in present-day Romania), 7 under the banate of Slavonia (mainly in present-day Slavonia and Croatia), and the rest forming Hungary proper (mainly present-day Hungary and Slovakia, with 10 counties entirely and 11 partially in present-day Slovakia.

===Counties===

====Hungary proper====

====Transylvania====
===Special status===

====Hungary proper====
*Halasszék (a sedes)
*Jászság
*Kolbázszék (a sedes)
*Kunság
*Provincia XXIV oppidorum terrae Scepusiensis (in 1412, thirteen of the towns were pawned to Poland and kept a special status)

====Transylvania====
*Aranyensis sedes (Hungarian:Aranyosszék)
*Csikiensis sedes (Csíkszék)
*Giergiensis sedes (Gyergyószék)
*Kászonszék (a sedes; Casin in Romanian)
*Kesdiensis sedes (Kézdiszék)
*Marusiensis sedes (Marosszék)
*Orbai sedes (Orbaiszék)
*Sepsiensis sedes (Sepsiszék)
*Udvarhelyensis sedes (Udvarhelyszék)

===Free royal towns and the mining towns (Liberae regiae civitate et civitates montanae)===
Their number was changing (the mining towns were largely situated in the Upper Lands – present-day Slovakia)

==16th–18th centuries==
In the 16th century, the Kingdom was so gravely impacted by Ottoman conquest that its territory was reduced to almost a third of its previous size. By 1541, the remaining part was renamed Royal Hungary and ruled by the Habsburgs.

===Captaincies (1547 – 1699)===
In 1547, Royal Hungary was divided for military and partly also administrative purposes in two &quot;captaincies-general&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;főkapitányságok&quot;, Slovak: &quot;hlavné kapitanáty&quot;): 
*Cisdanubia (largely present-day Slovakia)
*Transdanubia (the remaining Royal Hungary).

Later on, these captaincies were further subdivided.

In 1553 and 1578, southern and southeastern regions were split off into the Military Frontier and were de facto no longer part of the Kingdom.

Also, after 1606 there were the following captaincies-general:
*Captaincy of Upper Hungary (eastern Slovakia and adjacent northeastern present-day Hungary, part of present-day northern Romania and part of Carpathian Ruthenia, created 1563)
*Captaincy of Lower Hungary (western and central Slovakia, created 1563)
*Captaincy of Győr (territories between Lake Balaton and river Danube)
*Captaincy of Kanizsa (western Hungary)
*Captaincy of Croatia (western Croatia)
*Captaincy of Slavonia (northern Croatia)

===Counties (1699 - 1848)===
Note that many of the counties ceased to exist during the Turkish occupation (app. 1541 – 1699/1718). For administrative divisions on the Turkish territory see Ottoman Empire.

After the defeat of the Turks there were some 70 counties in the whole Kingdom of Hungary again. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties Temesiensis, Torontaliensis and Krassovinsis created the special administrative district &quot;Banatus Temesiensis&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Temesi Bánság&quot;). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (Confiniaria militaria) till the late 19th century.

The following list does not show Transylvania. The &quot;districtus&quot; is only a traditional formal division. Note that some of the previous counties, e. g. the Zarandiensis, were part of Transylvania at this time.

(a) Districtus Cis-Danubianus (13):
*Arvensis
*Bacsensis
*Barsiensis
*Honthiensis
*Lyptoviensis
*Nitriensis
*Neogradiensis
*Pesthiensis
*Posoniensis
*Strigoniensis
*Trenchiniensis
*Turocziensis
*Zoliensis

(b) Districtus Trans-Danubianus (11):
*Albensis
*Baranyiensis
*Castriferrei
*Comaromiensis
*Jauriensis
*Mosoniensis,

*Maramarosiensis
*Szabolcsensis
*Szathmariensis
*Temesiensis

(e) Counties between the Drava and Sava (after the defeat of the Turks around 1700, they were considered part of Croatia-Slavonia):
*Poseganus
*Sirmiensis
*Verovitiensis/Vukovariensis

===Free districts (Circuli/Districtus liberi)===
These were privileged territories, which were totally exempt from the county system.
* Districtus Jazygum et Cumanum ()
* Oppida sedecim Scepusiensia - since 1772 (First Partition of Poland); before 1772 the towns were pawned to Poland and had another special status
* Oppida privilegiata Hajdonicalia () – since the 17th century

===Free royal towns and the mining towns (Liberae regiae civitate et civitates montanae)===
Their number was changing

==After the 1848/1849 Revolution==
For details see Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)

===1849–1860===

During this period, the Kingdom of Croatia (with Međimurje), Kingdom of Slavonia, and the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banatus Temesiensis () were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to Vienna (Austria). The remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) was divided into 5 Districts. These Districts were divided into counties, whose traditional territories were modified in 1850 and 1853; several of the traditional counties were merged or partitioned. The official language during this period was German. The districts and counties were:

====Notes====
===1860–1867===
In October 1860, the Districts were abolished and the pre-1848 counties were restored.

==1867–1920==

From 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown (Kingdom of Hungary) were significantly remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited with Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume (Rijeka) declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the Military Frontier was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth.

In 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper was divided into seven statistical regions having no administrative functions, of which Transylvania formed one.

The following administrative divisions existed between 1886 and 1920:

<text>The British Rail Class 108 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby from 1958 to 1961, with a final production quantity of 333 vehicles.

==Overview==

The 108 was formed as a 2-, 3-, or 4-car unit. Its aluminium body led the type to be classed as a lightweight unit. These units stayed in regular service until 1990, when they began to be withdrawn from traffic. They were replaced on regional services by the new &quot;Sprinter&quot; derivative units, or by &quot;Turbo&quot; units on services around London. The final units lasted in traffic until October 1993, although many saw further use in departmental service, as sandite or route-learner units. Good condition on withdrawal and lack of asbestos have ensured that many of this class are now used on preserved railway lines.

== Orders ==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 19 October 1987, after the Glanrhyd Bridge over the River Towy at Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, was washed away by floodwater, a passenger train operated by a Class 108 unit fell into the river. Four people were killed.
*On 22 August 1990, a two-car Class 108 unit overran a signal and was in a head-on collision with a three-car unit majority-composed of Class 108 cars at Hyde Junction, Greater Manchester. Twenty-eight people were injured. The accident report noted the poor structural condition of the Class 108 vehicles compared to that of the Class 101 vehicle involved in the accident, and called for the 108 class to be withdrawn &quot;as quickly as is practicable&quot;.

==Preservation==

Many vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways. None are currently certified for use on the main line – although the Swanage Railway&#x27;s set was hauled from the railway to Eastleigh and back, for overhaul – and is believed to be the first class 108 to have been seen on main lines for a very long time.

==Model railways==
In 2007, Bachmann introduced OO gauge models of the Class 108 in BR green, BR blue and grey, and Network SouthEast liveries.

<doc id="992067" wikidata="Q59644" url="?curid=992067" title="Domino (character)">
<text>Domino (Neena Thurman) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is best known as a member of the mutant team X-Force. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/co-writer Rob Liefeld, Domino made her first full cover story appearance in &quot;X-Force&quot; #8 (March 1992) as an original member of the Wild Pack team led by the mutant Cable.

In addition to her exceptional marksmanship and hand-to-hand skills, Domino possesses mutant probability-altering powers. She often uses her skills as a mercenary, but has also been the partner, confidante, and love interest of the superhero Cable, a lieutenant in his militant group X-Force, and a member of the X-Men.

Domino was portrayed by Zazie Beetz in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018). She has also appeared in video games and minor animated television appearances.

==Creation==
Liefeld spoke on the conception of the character stating &quot;I was obsessed with the game dominoes. And I always thought that a character who was 100% black and white would be a tremendous visual. So when the time came for New Mutants #98 I got the full and I&#x27;m writing and drawing the book I had Deadpool, Domino, and Gideon... &#x27;What’s up with the luck power?&#x27; I told him that when you play dominoes, it&#x27;s a game of chance. When I pitched it to my editors they said, &#x27;Yeah, go with that. That&#x27;s good.&#x27;

==Publication history==
Apart from being a mainstay character in the first series of &quot;X-Force&quot;, Domino has had two limited self-titled series, one of which had her teaming with Puck against Lady Deathstrike and Donald Pierce. The second revealed her childhood.

The first female Domino to appear in Marvel comics was not the genuine Neena Thurman. A Domino imposter, a mutant shapeshifter named Copycat, first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #98 (Feb. 1991), and continued to assume Neena&#x27;s role in X-Force for a time. The real Domino was first published in the main flashback story recalled by Cable in &quot;X-Force&quot; #8 (March 1992). Her current narrative, brief cameo, second appearance was published on the last page of &quot;X-Force&quot; #11 (June 1992).

Domino received two self-titled limited series. The first came in 1997 and ran for 3 issues. The next ran for four issues in 2003. She has also appeared in a number of issues of &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; (Marvel, 2004/2006 series), and joined the first Wolverine-led X-Force as of &quot;X-Force&quot; vol. 3 #8 (Dec. 2008).

Domino appeared in her own three-issue miniseries with Wolverine entitled &quot;X-Force: Sex and Violence&quot;, written by Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle and drawn by Gabriele Dell&#x27;Otto. The story centers upon Domino and Wolverine&#x27;s mission to resolve a situation from Domino&#x27;s recent past. Chris Yost has said, &quot;It&#x27;s a chance for us to go in-depth into a couple of the characters. In the story, Domino has a hit put out on her and Wolverine finds out about it. Essentially, it&#x27;s the two of them going out to get that hit removed.&quot; Yost adds that the characters are up against the worst killers on the planet.

Domino was part of the main roster in &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; (by Dennis Hopeless and Salvador Larroca), from 2012 to 2014. She guest stars in the 2014 &quot;X-Force&quot;, beginning in issue #7.

Domino starred in her own series again starting in 2018, which led into a limited series in 2019 titled &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; where she leads an all-female team. These were written by Gail Simone and drawn by David Baldeon.

==Fictional character biography==
The woman who would become known as Domino is actually the result of a top-secret government breeding program intended to develop the perfect weapon. Domino was the only test subject to survive, but her &quot;luck&quot; power was deemed a failure at meeting the project&#x27;s goals. Her biological mother broke her out of the project and left her with Father Rudolpho Boschelli in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Chicago.

Domino eventually left the Church and became a mercenary. One of her first jobs was to stop &quot;Operation: Jericho&quot; which was a remote-controlled warbot project. Domino wrecked the robot, but in the process fried the mind of the soldier controlling it. She was then assigned to guard the hard working and innovative Dr. Milo Thurman, whose analytical ability made him too dangerous for the government to let roam free. Somehow, Domino and Thurman fell in love and were married. Due to Thurman&#x27;s love of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, he called Domino &quot;Beatrice&quot;. The two separated after a raid on the facility by AIM members, with Milo believing Domino had been killed during the altercation.

===Six Pack===
Domino helped found the mercenary band Six Pack, which introduced her to the mutant time-traveler Cable. Domino worked with the Six Pack for some time, taking on many missions for cash. The Six Pack was very brutal in their adventures, often shooting down entire crowds of people who got in their way. The team, also known as the Wild Pack, went on missions in Iran, and participated in a raid on a HYDRA base, which Domino participated in. During her time with the Wild Pack, she had her first confrontations with Stryfe (Cable&#x27;s evil clone) in Afghanistan and Uruguay.

===Replacement===
When Cable became the leader of the New Mutants following their break from the X-Men, a mutant named Copycat impersonated Domino and joined as his field leader and stayed with the team as they changed from the New Mutants to X-Force. When it was revealed that the real Domino was actually a prisoner of the supervillain Tolliver for over a year, X-Force rejected Domino&#x27;s imposter and, with Cable&#x27;s reassurances, planned to rescue the real Domino and welcome her onto the team.

Meanwhile, the real Domino learned of Tolliver&#x27;s destruction of X-Force&#x27;s Adirondack base. Cable dragged Copycat along and found her at Tolliver&#x27;s Italian home, where Copycat was stabbed from behind by her ex-boyfriend Deadpool. Domino was freed during the fight, shooting Deadpool herself. Cable sent her to find X-Force. She escaped on Tolliver&#x27;s helicopter and survived a fall from Tolliver&#x27;s helicopter into the sea. She found X-Force and joined the team.

Domino stayed with the team for most of its existence, becoming its &quot;de facto&quot; leader when Cable left the team on several occasions. For a while, she was a prisoner of the forces of Bastion, which severely affected her mentally and physically. During X-Force&#x27;s existence, Domino had several solo adventures. During one, she was forced to kill her mentally ill, ex–Six Pack partner Grizzly.

===X-Corporation===

When X-Force briefly disbanded, Domino joined the X-Corporation. While working in their Hong Kong branch, Domino&#x27;s partner, Risque, was murdered and she summoned the core group of the X-Men to help investigate. Together the mutants uncovered the truth behind John Sublime&#x27;s &quot;Third Species&quot; movement: he was harvesting body parts from living mutants to create his U-Men. They also helped free the mutant named Xorn.

During her solo period, Domino began to search for her mother, Beatrice, and clues to her past. In her search, Domino learned that the &quot;Project: Armageddon&quot;, was still active. Led to a secret base in Florida, Domino finds a mutant boy named Lazarus who had the same eye tattoo. Lazarus imprisoned Domino there for observation. Lazarus turns out to be her half-brother with powerful emotion controlling abilities and the true result of the Perfect Weapon program. Soon after attempting to liberate him, a fanatical group of quasi-priests called the Armajesuits, who were against the project, arrive to kill Lazarus and prevent him from reaching his full development. Domino discovers that her mother leads the Armajesuits and is forced to shoot her to save Lazarus&#x27;s life. She takes Lazarus to Father Boschelli and the Church she was raised in for sanctuary, although unbeknown to her, Beatrice subsequently abducts Lazarus from there.

===Cable and Deadpool===
Later, she was employed by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a member of the new Six Pack. Alongside G. W. Bridge, Hammer, Solo, Anaconda, and Constrictor, she attacked Cable at his community &quot;Providence&quot;, but she quickly defected to his side after the Six Pack was defeated by Cable and Deadpool. Domino followed Deadpool to Rumekistan, where she assassinated the country&#x27;s dictator, Flag-Smasher, only to find out it was part of a plan to install Cable as leader of that nation. After a conversation with Citizen V, she then attempted to kill Cable, believing that he would lead them to ruin.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
During the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Domino, Shatterstar and Caliban, under the X-Force name, led an attack on the Xavier Institute and broke out more than half of the 198, bringing the tension between the 198 and O*N*E to a head. After her other team, the Six Pack disbands, she and Cable are allies on Providence, until a fight with Hecatomb causes the island to sink into the ocean, leaving Cable presumed dead.

Domino is later recruited by G. W. Bridge along with Silver Sable and the Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to track down the Punisher. When a fake Punisher started targeting civilians, she was the only team member to believe in Castle&#x27;s innocence.

===X-Force===
After the Punisher stint, Domino finds Wolverine and X-Force in Tokyo and joins them in trying to capture Vanisher. Questions to Domino&#x27;s authenticity have been raised when her luck powers fail her several times.

On behalf of Wolverine, Domino is asked to stop in a cemetery to deliver flowers to a deceased loved one. She encounters Spiral, Chimera and Lady Deathstrike who have dug up Revanche&#x27;s body. After a brief fight, she wounds Chimera and the women escape with the body, but Domino manages to replace Jean Grey&#x27;s body before the Red Queen could take it as a host.

Domino and Wolverine go on a mission to resolve a situation from Domino&#x27;s past.

===2010 – present===
Domino is the first person to learn Red Hulk&#x27;s identity and is marked for death. Doc Samson provides Red Hulk with a list of people (Deadpool, the Punisher, Thundra and Elektra) to kill her. When the group arrives, they find her in a bar with the members of X-Force. Afterwards, she reveals it was her husband who named her Domino.

Domino appears post-&quot;Regenesis&quot; as a regular member of Storm&#x27;s security team, tasked with the responsibility of safeguarding Utopia from all foreign threats.. She fights with them during the war against the Avengers.

After the events of the 2012 &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Domino left Utopia like all the mutants who lived there. She later joins Cable&#x27;s new X-Force group.

As part of the 2016 Marvel NOW! branding, Domino forms a second incarnation of the Mercs for Money that consisted of Gorilla-Man, Machine Man, and Masacre. When they arrive to help Deadpool when it comes to freeing Negasonic Teenage Warhead from Umbral Dynamics, Domino stated to Deadpool that they arrived to help and that she is calling the shots on the Mercs for Money.

Domino appears as a target for the newly revamped Weapon X Program and is opted to join Old Man Logan&#x27;s new team.

For the &quot;Dawn of X&quot; relaunch, she joins the new X-Force team, which now operates as an intelligence agency for Krakoa.

==Powers and abilities==
Domino is a mutant with the ability to subconsciously generate a &quot;psionic aura&quot; that alters the probabilities of events and actions within her line of sight. The aura causes improbable (but not impossible) outcomes that are personally beneficial. The resulting effects of this &quot;subliminal telekinesis&quot; are observed as &quot;good luck&quot; for Domino and &quot;bad luck&quot; for her opponents (from enemy equipment serendipitously malfunctioning to averting imminent catastrophes through seemingly chance actions).

Instead of being consciously activated, her probability-warping powers trigger automatically when Domino faces potential harm, danger, or personal benefit (e.g. engaging in games of chance). The psionic aura benefits and protects Domino even when she isn&#x27;t consciously aware that danger is present.

Domino must be engaging in an action with multiple possible outcomes for her power to manifest: it will not trigger if she is inactive. Engaging in any action that her power can influence causes Domino&#x27;s cerebral cortex to emit bio electrical pulses that guide her movements, enhancing her reflexes and agility to near-superhuman levels.

Domino is highly trained as a weapons expert and marksman; a superb athlete and swimmer; martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant; and an accomplished linguist.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Chris Condry of &quot;Looper&quot; referred to Domino as &quot;potentially the greatest gunslinger in history,&quot; saying, &quot;Maybe the number one reason Domino deserves more love is that she is one of the only characters in comics history who allows for a complete suspension of disbelief with her every action. Domino, to whom anything is possible, is a writer&#x27;s — and therefore a reader&#x27;s –- dream come true.&quot; Rosie Knight of &quot;Nerdist&quot; called Domino &quot;Marvel’s luckiest lady,&quot; writing, &quot;Comics offer us up a smorgasbord of cool characters, and sometimes it’s hard to keep up with all of them. [...] Domino is a radical female character who has a surprisingly prestigious selection of creators in her back catalogue.&quot; Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; described Domino as a &quot;very important name for fans of Marvel Comics,&quot; asserting, &quot;Domino is a character that is packed with a lot more potential than her series and film appearances thus far seem to indicate. [...] Domino is one of the greats from X-Force history and is long overdue for some serious recognition in comics and movies.&quot; Jim Dandeneau of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; stated, &quot;She’s a ton of fun as a character. Someone who’s lucky all the time and knows it can get into some crazy stuff. Making her a mercenary just leans into the slapstick violence you can pull off with her. And when you pair her with a fourth wall breaker like Deadpool, narrative convenience becomes an end goal of its own.&quot; Darby Harn of &quot;CBR.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Domino is one of the luckiest people around, and that&#x27;s not only to do with her probability-altering powers. This member of the New Mutants and very quickly X-Force thereafter got in on the ground floor of the huge boom in popularity of the world of the X-Men in the early 90s. She quickly became a hallmark character.&quot;

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Domino&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Domino&quot; #1 was the 8th best selling comic in April 2018.

Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; called &quot;Domino&quot; #1 a &quot;thoughtful, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining book about a badass anti-heroine,&quot; writing, &quot;&quot;Domino&quot; #1 is a wonderful comic with a lot of heart and fun at its core. Simone once more shows how she is one of the greatest writers in the business, and David Baldeon brings his distinct style to make the comic look great. This one is highly recommended.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Domino&quot; #1 a grade of 7.8 out of 10, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;ve been waiting for Domino to branch out on her own, this new series won&#x27;t disappoint. It delivers some wacky good fun and stylish visuals while also making it plain that being a super-lucky assassin isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. While there are some nagging storytelling flaws in this first issue, it&#x27;s clear that Neena Thurman is in good hands.&quot;

==== &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; - 2019 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; #1 was the 43rd best selling comic book in March 2019. The &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; trade paper back was the 71st best selling graphic novel in September 2019.

Rollin Bishop of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, &quot;Whereas Domino&#x27;s previous outing ended as a muddled mess, this new miniseries picks up the pieces and orients them towards a new, Celestial threat with a capital &quot;C&quot; that gets things back in order swiftly. The initial setting of the stage is a little awkward, but the actual story here has meat on its bones, and I&#x27;m genuinely excited to see what happens next.&quot; Melody MacReady of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the &quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; comic book series 8th in their &quot;Gail Simone&#x27;s 10 Best Comics&quot; list, writing, &quot;&quot;Domino: Hotshots&quot; sees the mutant Domino creating her own team of female heroes and anti-heroes known as the Hotshots. This team features the Natasha Romanoff version of Black Widow, White Fox, Outlaw, Diamondback, and Atlas Bear. These drastically different characters who tend to operate solo now working together lead to comedic antics that will make any reader grin. However, their combined skills and ability make for unique action as they are caught between two warring nations. As a bonus, most of these characters are not household names thus making it far from the typical superhero team.&quot;

==Other characters named Domino==
A male character named Domino (Dominic Dunsinane) aided the Scourge of the Underworld as an informant. He was killed by a rogue Scourge agent named Bloodstain in &quot;U.S. Agent&quot; #4 (Sept. 1993) (Marvel Comics).

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Domino was introduced in the second part of the &quot;Cable&quot; storyline, that can be found in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #76 (Jan. 2007). Once again, Domino appears to be part of Cable&#x27;s team and looks just like her original counterpart.

=== X-Men: The End ===

<text>USS &quot;Schley&quot; (DD-103) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later designated, APD-14 in World War II. She was the first ship named in honor of Winfield Scott Schley.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Schley&quot; was laid down on 29 October 1917 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California. The ship was launched on 28 March 1918, sponsored by Miss Eleanor Martin. The destroyer was commissioned on 20 September 1918, Commander Robert C. Giffen in command.

==Service history==

===World War I===

&quot;Schley&quot; sailed from San Diego on 10 October 1918 for the east coast and, on 12 November, departed New York for the Mediterranean Sea. On 24 January 1919 at Taranto, Italy, she embarked Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, Senior American Naval Officer in Turkey, and transported him to Constantinople. &quot;Schley&quot; next assumed duty in the Adriatic Sea, acting as station ship at Pola, Italy, from 17 February to 15 April, and then visiting Italian and Yugoslav ports on the Adriatic until heading for the United States on 2 July. &quot;Schley&quot; returned to San Diego on 8 September 1919 and, except for trips to San Francisco for repairs, remained there until she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 1 June 1922.

===World War II===
With Europe again at war and war threatening in the Pacific Ocean, &quot;Schley&quot; was recommissioned at San Diego on 3 October 1940. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 December for patrols and exercises there the next year. When Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the destroyer was moored in a nest of ships undergoing and, as her guns were dismantled, was able to do little besides reply with small arms fire. Her overhaul was rushed to completion; and, on 20 December, she took up a patrol station off the channel approaching Pearl Harbor. She operated there and off Honolulu for almost a year. On 13 December 1942, she departed Hawaiian waters for conversion into a fast transport at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. &quot;Schley&quot; was reclassified APD-14 effective 6 February 1943.

&quot;Schley&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 February and proceeded to the New Hebrides, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 27 March. In the South Pacific, she trained intensively with Marine raiders and other troops, acted as a patrol and escort vessel, and operated as a transport between the Solomons, the New Hebrides, American Samoa, and New Zealand.

&quot;Schley&quot; first participated in a landing under combat conditions on 30 June at New Georgia. With two other APDs and some smaller ships, she put troops ashore at Wickham Anchorage at the southwest end of Vangunu. On 5 July, she landed a second group of troops at Rice Anchorage, New Georgia. During this operation, a Japanese reinforcement group belatedly arrived on the scene and, in retiring, sank with a long-range torpedo shot. After another trip to Rice Anchorage with supplies and ammunition, &quot;Schley&quot; sailed from Espiritu Santo on 1 August for overhaul at Mare Island.

====1944====

&quot;Schley&quot; left the west coast for Pearl Harbor on 7 October, but engine repairs at Pearl Harbor took most of the rest of the year. On 30 December 1943, she arrived at San Diego to join the task force training for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. The force sailed from the west coast on 13 January 1944 and arrived off Kwajalein on 31 January. &quot;Schley&quot; landed her troops that day and then performed antisubmarine patrol duty until she reembarked her troops on 7 February.

She sailed for Eniwetok a week later. Her activities there showed the versatility of the small, fast transports. She arrived on 17 February and, that night, put her troops ashore on Bpgon Island to prevent enemy infiltration from Engebi, which American troops had invaded earlier in the day. The next morning, she began seizing the remaining islands west of the main island of Eniwetok. That day, her troops captured five islands and helped to secure Engebi and Bogon.

On 24 February, after transferring her troops to other transports, she got underway for Kwajalein to escort two transports from that atoll to her new area of operations, New Guinea.

&quot;Schley&quot; arrived off New Guinea on 12 March and conducted convoy operations for the next month. On 22 April, she participated in the landings at Aitape, putting troops ashore and providing gunfire support. The next day at Tumleo Island, her boats landed troops from a larger transport while &quot;Schley&quot; again provided gunfire support. After repairs to a damaged propeller, &quot;Schley&quot; landed a company of troops on Niroemoar Island to set up a radar unit on 19 May. The next day, she rescued the crew of a wrecked American gasoline barge off Wakde Island and then sank two Japanese barges and silenced an enemy shore battery. The busy ship landed troops on Biak on 27 May and at Cape Sansapor at the western end of New Guinea on 30 July. She then proceeded to Australia for repairs.

&quot;Schley&quot; next participated in two important preliminaries for the reconquest of the Philippines. She landed troops on Morotai on 9 September, and, on 17 October, formed part of the APD group that occupied the small islands at the mouth of Leyte Gulf, clearing the way for the invasion of Leyte three days later.

After a month of convoy operations, &quot;Schley&quot; joined the task group which carried out landings in Ormoc Bay on 7 December. The group came under intense &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack; although her sister ship, , was sunk, &quot;Schley&quot; escaped damage. She then participated in the landings at Mindoro on 15 December 1944 and at Lingayen on 9 January 1945; and, during each operation, evaded an attacking &quot;kamikaze&quot;. At Mindoro, American planes shot down the &quot;kamikaze&quot; a scant thousand yards from &quot;Schley&quot;. At Lingayen, the &quot;kamikaze&quot; veered off at the last minute to attack another ship but missed. &quot;Schley&quot; remained on patrol off Lingayen until 18 January.

====1945–1946====
On 15 February, she landed troops at Mariveles Bay in order to cut off Japanese escape routes during the assault on Manila Bay and, two days later, put troops ashore under enemy fire on Corregidor, climaxing and completing her operations in the Philippines.

&quot;Schley&quot; departed Manila Bay on the 19th and left the Philippines for Ulithi on 25 February. She then escorted convoys in the western Pacific, and was briefly at Okinawa with one from 26 April to 28 April. On 29 May, &quot;Schley&quot; arrived at San Diego for repairs, and was redesignated DD-103 effective 5 July &quot;for duty as rear-area escort and training vessel&quot;, as she was then too worn out for further front-line service. She was still under overhaul when the war ended, and after being made seaworthy, sailed on 17 September 1945 for inactivation at Philadelphia. &quot;Schley&quot; was decommissioned on 9 November 1945 and struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1945. Scrapping was completed by the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 March 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Schley&quot; received 11 battle stars for her duty in World War II.

<doc id="992090" wikidata="Q4970762" url="?curid=992090" title="British Rail Class 24">
<text>The British Rail Class 24 diesel locomotives, originally known as the Sulzer Type 2, were built from 1958 to 1961. 151 were built at Derby, Crewe and Darlington, the first twenty of them as part of the British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan. This class was used as the basis for the development of the Class 25 locomotives.

The final survivor, no. 24081, was withdrawn from Crewe depot in 1980.

==Technical details==

===Engine===
The main power for the class 24 was the Sulzer 6LDA28 diesel engine - denoting 6 cylinders; Locomotive use; Direct fuel injection; (turbo-charged); bore cylinders. This was effectively an off-the-shelf purchase with small changes to bearings, injectors and some other minor items. The same engine was used in the CIE 101 Class locomotives in Ireland.

===Transmission===
The diesel engine powered another off-the-shelf product, the British Thomson-Houston (BTH) RTB15656 main generator which, in the class 24, was rated at , 750/525 V and 980/1400 A at 750 rpm. Traction motors, one per axle, were also by BTH being the type 137BY rated at , 525 V, 350 A at 560 rpm connected to the axle via a 16:81 gear stepdown ratio, each force ventilated by an AEI electric motor.

===Train heating===
The original pilot scheme locos (D5000–D5019) were fitted with a Stone Vapor type OK4646A steam heating boiler with a water tank. The following ten locos had the similar per hour type OK4616B and a reduced water capacity of , and this was perpetuated in the remaining production run which used the Stone Vapour per hour type L4610 boiler. These variations meant that the initial batch of 20 locomotives weighed , the following 10 locomotives slightly less at , the remaining Class 24/0 at , and the Class 24/1 at exactly . During subsequent years the boilers were removed from the majority of Class 24/1 locomotives, reducing the overall weight by . Ten locomotives (D5102–5111) had no train heating, the space being occupied by the air compressors needed for operating the Consett iron ore trains.

===Other systems===
Several of the systems within the class 24s were standard. The braking system was the standard BR system, adopted as part of the Modernisation Plan, of locomotive air and train vacuum brake, both applied by a single handle via a proportional valve. Similarly, the connection for multiple working was the standard electro-pneumatic system designated &quot;Blue Star&quot; with each loco bearing a small blue coloured 5-pointed star above each buffer to denote this. Also common was the provision of a door to allow staff to pass between locomotives, or between a locomotive and adjacent coach. In practice, these were rarely used and were sealed shut at overhaul during the 1970s to reduce draughts in the cab.

With production reaching 151 there were some differences between batches of locos too. Ten of the initial twenty had &quot;Athermos&quot; pressure-lubricated plain bearing axleboxes rather than the more usual roller-bearing axleboxes. Although these remained for the life of the locos they were the only ones so fitted. Much more noticeable were D5114–D5132 which were fitted with tablet catchers on the side of the driver&#x27;s cab for use on the Far North Line from Inverness and on the Highland Main Line from Perth to Inverness. Also very visible were the roof-mounted headcode boxes fitted from D5114 giving an outward appearance very similar to the later Class 25 but without horn grilles.

==External condition==

===Liveries===
The pilot scheme locomotives were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body. D5000 was delivered with a narrow light grey stripe at waist level while the remainder had a broad light grey stripe at solebar level. This light grey stripe may have appeared bluish and has been described as pale blue or eggshell, but in most illustrations, it appears to be off-white. At first, green liveried locos had plain green ends, but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow warning panels, and then from 1967 to full yellow ends, some locos receiving these while still in green livery. At least five locos were repainted in two-tone green livery (applied along with the small yellow warning panel) in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s.

The first class 24 painted in Rail Blue livery was D5068 in December 1966, and repainting continued into the mid-1970s, although some locomotives were withdrawn before being painted in this colour.

===Alterations===
As with many large classes of locomotive, there were some variations during the Class 24s&#x27; lifetime, some affecting all of the class (nominally), and others just individual locos. One such locomotive was 24133, one of the last survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end, the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27. This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had &#x27;car lights&#x27; fitted to each nose. These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a single lamp. Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the class 24s and class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.

In 1960 D5008 was fitted with a Pressure-charging Protection Unit which was designed to prevent the engine from running continuously above the smoke limit. The unit failed on one occasion allowing significant smoke emission, and in general did not demonstrate any significant impact on the amount of visible smoke emitted. The unit was subsequently removed.

==Operation==
Initial deliveries were for operation in the Crewe and Derby areas, but fifteen of the initial twenty were diverted for use on the Southern Region to cover for delays in the Kent Coast Electrification scheme. Here the heavy weight was not acceptable and the locos in question had to have their boilers removed before they were accepted. Later some locos had their boilers re-fitted and these examples could be found, often in tandem with a Class 33 to provide steam heating to the coaches, the 33s only having electric train heat (ETH).

As deliveries continued allocations were made to both the London Midland Region and Eastern Region, and with the class becoming familiar to crews and staff around London they were used on freight trains over the Metropolitan Widened Lines, locos so used being fitted with London Transport tripcocks – although these were removed after closure of this route in 1971. Locos allocated to East Anglia for use on freight soon became redundant due to the rundown of freight in that region, and these were, in turn, moved to Wales and Lancashire.

Class 24s took over the &#x27;Condor&#x27; fast freight service between London (Hendon) and Glasgow (Gushetfaulds) in 1961, the train having previously been hauled by the Metro-Vic Co-Bo locos for which it is best remembered. Thus the class was also used when a second &quot;Condor&quot; fast overnight freight service was introduced, running from Aston to Glasgow. These were the usual motive power from its introduction on 17 January 1963 when D5082 hauled the Down train and D5083 the up train until replaced by the first Freightliner service in 1965.

The batch D5096–D5113 were all allocated to Gateshead depot in 1966 to replace 9F steam locos on the Tyne Dock to Consett iron ore trains. These workings used a special design of bogie hopper wagon, and these locos had an additional compressor and associated pipework. These workings, typically with loads of around 1,000 tons, were double-headed and continued until taken over by Class 37s in the 1970s, when these locos were reallocated to Scottish depots. Incidentally D5096 was, when delivered in January 1960, the first main line diesel locomotive to be built at Darlington Works.

The next batch of locos, D5114–D5132, were allocated to Inverness, and became synonymous with rail operations in the Scottish Highlands, as did a similar batch of Class 26 locos, the two being considered interchangeable in operation. Single Class 24s operated from Inverness on passenger and freight trains of up to 290 tons, and double-headed on trains up to 580 tons including the Royal Highlander which was regularly made up of 16 coaches. Class 24s and Class 26s were used turn and turn about until all Class 24s allocated to Inverness were replaced by Class 26s in 1975.

The final batch of Class 24s were allocated to the London Midland Region for use on the &quot;Western Lines&quot; which covered North Wales and Mid Wales. In the latter area, particularly on the ex-Cambrian Railways lines, Class 24s and the similar Class 25s were the only diesel types to be found, and crews from Aberystwyth shed were only trained on these types. This proved to be an issue on summer Saturdays, and after problems with timekeeping and failures in service, heavier trains were double-headed or hauled by the more powerful Class 40 locomotives between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth.

===Departmental use===
In November 1975, 24061 was transferred to BRs research department based at Derby Works, and was allocated the number RDB968007. This loco was subsequently renumbered as 97201 and was finally withdrawn on 4 December 1987, the last Class 24 to be operational on BR.
After withdrawal in 1976 two Class 24s were converted into train pre-heating units and were allocated to the Western Region: 24054 was withdrawn in August and became TDB968008, being allocated to until withdrawn in October 1982; 24142 became TDB968009 and was allocated to Landore.

===Withdrawal===
The very first Class 24 to be withdrawn was in November 1967 when a fire broke out on D5051 while it was working a train of empty coal wagons in Scotland. The damage was too severe for it to be repaired, and it was cut up at Inverurie in August 1968. It had lasted exactly 8 years. The second Class 24 to be withdrawn was also as the result of an accident in Scotland, this time at Castlecary. In this case D5122, running light engine, hit a stationary DMU at about , the impact and subsequent fire bending the main frames and completely destroying the No.2 end. The accident happened on 9 September 1968 but despite being withdrawn the same month, the locomotive was not finally cut up until March 1971. A total of fourteen Class 24s were withdrawn and scrapped without receiving a TOPS number.

Some Class 24s were withdrawn in 1973 with the closure of the Waverley route, which linked and Edinburgh, but most of these were put into storage and subsequently re-entered traffic to fill gaps left by the movement of Class 25s to cover the withdrawal of Class 22s on the Western Region. Thus Class 24 withdrawals only started in earnest with completion of the Glasgow electrification in 1974, and re-allocation of Class 26 and Class 27 locos saw the Class 24s concentrated around various Lancashire depots and at Carlisle. On 27 November 1976 there were just ten Class 24s still in operational service, all allocated to Crewe Diesel Depot (depot code CD). However, with the reinstatement of 24082 and 24073 this number climbed to 12 by February 1977.

In January 1978, two farewell railtours were run – 24082 and 24087 hauled the &quot;Merseyside Express&quot; from London St Pancras to Liverpool and return on the 14th, and 24087 and 24133 hauled the &quot;Cambrian Coast Express&quot; from Birmingham to Aberystwyth and Barmouth on the 28th. On the latter trip, 24087 failed on the outward journey, was dumped at Machynlleth on the return journey and never worked again.

On 21 January 24133 had also taken part in the &quot;Farewell to the 44s&quot; tour, providing steam heating for the coaches while 44008 Penyghent provided the motive power, on the Crewe to Chester leg of a circular tour from London.

For the summer of 1978, six class 24s remained in service – 24023, 035, 047, 063, 081 and 082. In May, a North Wales DMU passenger diagram was converted to loco haulage on Mondays to Fridays, comprising the 09:42 Llandudno - Manchester, 13:30 return, 16:42 Llandudno - Crewe, 20:30 Crewe - Bangor and 22.45 Bangor - Llandudno Junction. At least five different class 24s were recorded on this diagram during the summer. Additionally, on Saturday 10 June 24082 worked a Llandudno Junction – London Euston relief train all the way to London due to a lack of a replacement loco at Crewe.

By January 1979, only three locos remained in use – 24063, 081 and 082. 24082 was withdrawn on 1 March and 24063 on 9 April, leaving 24081 the last in service. The final recorded passenger duty of a Class 24 was on 2 August 1979 when 24081 rescued 40129 at Colwyn Bay on the 18:05 Holyhead – Euston, hauling the train as far as Crewe.

Cutting up of some Class 24s was carried out at Swindon Works on the Western Region, an area which had never received an allocation of Class 24s. The first locos were 24042, 24045, 24048 and 24050 which were moved from Derby Works in December 1975, and the last of the 67 Class 24s cut up at Swindon was 24084 in early December 1978.

The very last Class 24 to be withdrawn from operational service was 24081. This loco, allocated to Crewe Diesel Depot had been considered something of a celebrity, lasting over a year after the previous withdrawal of 24063 on 9 April 1979. 24081 was finally withdrawn in October 1980 having worked its last revenue earning train, the 05.43 Grange - Shotwick freight on 7 January 1980, and then making guest appearances at Nuneaton, Crewe Works Open Day, and Southport.

==Preservation==

Four locomotives have been preserved.
==Accidents==
* D5146 was hauling a freight train that was derailed near Weedon, Northamptonshire on 1 April 1963. The accident was due to a defective wagon. An express passenger train collided with the derailed wagons.
* D5002 was involved in the 1967 Stechford rail crash.
* D5122 was involved in a serious accident at Castlecary, Dunbartonshire in 1968.
* 5028 was involved in the Chester General rail crash in 1972.

==Models==
Bachmann Branchline have produced a 00 gauge variant of the class 24 several times with recent releases listed on the Bachmann website. Sutton Locomotive Workshop also produces 00 gauge, super detail variant of the class 24.

<doc id="992091" wikidata="Q5149910" url="?curid=992091" title="Columbia University tunnels">
<text>Columbia University in New York City has an extensive tunnel system underneath its Morningside Heights campus connecting many of its buildings, used by the university as conduits for steam, electricity, telecommunications, and other infrastructure. Throughout their history, the tunnels have also been used for other purposes, mostly centering around transportation. During the first half of the 20th century, they were used by students to avoid aboveground traffic. When the university housed the Manhattan Project, they were allegedly used to move radioactive material between buildings. During the Columbia University protests of 1968, students used the tunnels to facilitate their occupation of buildings on campus.

Throughout their history, the tunnels have been thoroughly explored by generations of students, and have been the subject of numerous campus legends. Though sections have been cordoned off by the university since the 1960s, either in response to the 1968 protests or rampant campus typewriter theft, many parts can still be legally accessed. Similar tunnels also exist under the affiliated Barnard College.

== History ==

Columbia University&#x27;s current Morningside Heights campus in Manhattan was dedicated in 1896. The oldest section predates the campus dedication; it was built when the land was owned by the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which used the tunnels to transport patients between buildings. In the section under Uris Hall and the Engineering Terrace, the deepest portion of the tunnels, running underground, furnaces and tracks still remain in the tunnels from when they were used to transport coal around the university for heating purposes. The largest sections of the tunnel system emanate from the university&#x27;s power plant under the Sherman Fairchild Center.

According to student accounts, during the Manhattan Project, the tunnels were used by Columbia scientists to transport radioactive material between buildings. Prior to its removal in 2008, the basement of Pupin Hall, which was only accessible through the tunnels, contained a Manhattan Project-era cyclotron built by John R. Dunning.

In 1953, Columbia closed off the portion of 116th Street that bisected its campus. Prior to this, the tunnels were commonly used as pedestrian thoroughfares in order to avoid traffic, and were used by students well into the 1960s. During the Cold War, portions of the tunnels were used as nuclear shelters. Some time before the construction of Ferris Booth Hall, the tunnels also housed a shooting range beneath Kent Hall used by the Columbia Rifle Team.

During the 1968 student strike, student staff at WKCR, Columbia&#x27;s radio station, used the tunnels to break into telephone distribution panel rooms and seize the university&#x27;s telephone system in order to allow reporters to communicate with station headquarters through campus phones. Students also made use of the tunnels to travel between buildings occupied by strikers and to bring them supplies. Though the tunnels helped students occupy many of the buildings on campus, they were also accessible to the agents of the administration; university staff and eventually the police used them to capture and remove the protestors, with the added benefit that they could do so away from press coverage.

In the 1960s, many of the tunnels&#x27; passages were sealed off by the university administration. This has been reported to be either in response to the 1968 protests or an epidemic of typewriter theft from the administration facilitated by the tunnels, while it has been rumored by students that they were closed due to leftover radiation from the Manhattan Project. , many tunnels, including the one connecting the freshman dorms John Jay Hall, Wallach Hall, and Hartley Hall, are still accessible. , the tunnels under Barnard College, the university&#x27;s affiliated women&#x27;s liberal arts college, are still open for pedestrian use.

== Traditions ==
Over the course of Columbia University&#x27;s history there have been many stories about tunnels under the campus, including one of a rumored passage across Broadway connecting the Columbia and Barnard College campuses. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1932 that several undergraduates attempted to find such a tunnel in order to spy on the secrecy-shrouded Barnard Greek Games, but were unsuccessful. Urban legends also tell of a freshman in the early 20th century who disappeared into the tunnels and was forgotten until he failed to advance to receive his diploma. Despite having never attended any classes, he supposedly graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and was considered for Phi Beta Kappa. More recently, it has been rumored that the tunnels are used as a graveyard for underperforming graduates as part of Lee Bollinger&#x27;s &quot;extermination plan&quot; for alumni who fail to donate to the school.

The tunnels have been explored by generations of Columbia students and extensively mapped. Student activist Ken Hechtman was known to have explored the tunnels, and was expelled in 1987 after stealing uranium-238, chloroform, mercury, and pure caffeine from Pupin Hall using the tunnels. Other explorers included Steve Duncan and Miru Kim, who has used the tunnels as a backdrop for her photography. According to her 1932 memoir, &quot;The Fun of It&quot;, Amelia Earhart was &quot;familiar with all the forbidden underground passageways which connected the different buildings of the University&quot; when she was a student at Columbia in 1920.

== In popular culture ==
The Columbia tunnel system has been described as perhaps &quot;the largest of any university in America&quot; after that of MIT, and &quot;probably the most famous&quot;. Given their history with the Manhattan Project and the 1968 protests, they have been featured in numerous action novels, including &quot;Once a Spy&quot; by Keith Thomson, &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; by Charles Ardai, and &quot;The Return&quot; by Joseph Helmreich. They have also appeared in several fictional and non-fictional accounts of the 1968 protests, including &quot;A Time to Stir: Columbia &#x27;68&quot;, edited by Paul Cronin and &quot;1968: Dreams of Revolution&quot; by Wilber W. Caldwell.

<doc id="992094" wikidata="Q1185427" url="?curid=992094" title="Demetri Porphyrios">
<text>Demetri Porphyrios (; born 1949) is a Greek architect and author who practices architecture in London as principal of the firm Porphyrios Associates. In addition to his architectural practice and writing, Porphyrios has held a number of teaching positions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece. He is currently a visiting professor at the Yale School of Architecture.

While Porphyrios is considered to be an exponent of New Classical architecture, he has designed buildings in both the Gothic and classical idioms. Moreover, he has designed occasional buildings in a more modernist style, notably the glass curtain-walled office block One Forbury Square (2003) in Reading, Berkshire, England.

==Education==
Porphyrios studied at Princeton University where he earned a M.Arch. (Master of Architecture), and a Ph.D. in the history and theory of architecture. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, in which he described the themes he believed had generated Aalto&#x27;s work (typology, urbanism and nature), while arguing that Aalto&#x27;s work was the end of the line for modernist architecture. Published later as &quot;Sources of Modern Eclecticism&quot; (London: Academy Editions, 1982), the book was presented as a structuralist analysis of Aalto&#x27;s architecture; its author described as having been influenced by the philosophers Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser.

In his writing, Porphyrios has advocated a &quot;classicism without style&quot; (which he called &quot;Doricism&quot;), similar to the Nordic Classicism that prevailed in early 20th-century Scandinavia in the work of architects such as Kay Fisker in Denmark, Gunnar Asplund in Sweden, and in the early work of Alvar Aalto in Finland.

==Career==
In the 1980s, Porphyrios regularly contributed to the journal &quot;Architectural Design&quot;, advocating the classical and vernacular as rational architectural languages. In 2002, Princeton University commissioned him to design a residential college (Whitman College) in the Collegiate Gothic style, which was completed in 2007. Following Princeton, Porphyrios began work on Selwyn College, Cambridge and Magdalen College, Oxford, adding his neoclassical style to the two ancient British universities.

<doc id="992097" wikidata="Q7785602" url="?curid=992097" title="This Be The Verse">
<text>&quot;This Be The Verse&quot; is a lyric poem in three stanzas with an alternating rhyme scheme, by the English poet Philip Larkin (1922–1985). It was written around April 1971, was first published in the August 1971 issue of &quot;New Humanist&quot;, and appeared in the 1974 collection &quot;High Windows&quot;.

It is one of Larkin&#x27;s best-known poems; the opening lines (&quot;They fuck you up, your mum and dad&quot;) are among his most frequently quoted. Larkin himself compared it with W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;Lake Isle of Innisfree&quot; and said he expected to hear it recited in his honour by a thousand Girl Guides before he died. It is frequently parodied. Television viewers in the United Kingdom voted it one of the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Top 100 Poems&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The poem consists of three stanzas of four iambic tetrameter feet on an alternating rhyme scheme. The speaker, addressing the reader directly, expresses the idea that parents put a lot of emotional weight on their children with the famous line, &quot;They fuck you up, your mum and dad&quot;. The speaker goes on to explain that it may not be intentional, but stems from their own emotional baggage (with &quot;some extra, just for you&quot;). In the second stanza, the speaker describes the way that the reader&#x27;s parents were also given this emotional trauma by &quot;their&quot; parents. The third stanza is where the poem makes its assertion: the misery humanity experiences is a cycle that expands continuously. The speaker concludes with some advice: &quot;Get out as early as you can... And don’t have any kids yourself&quot;.

The title of the poem is an allusion to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (&quot;This be the verse you grave for me&quot;). Stevenson&#x27;s thought of a happy homecoming in death is given an ironic turn. He often thought of dying in a ditch, but ended up dying peacefully in his home at the age of 44. Being a &quot;[g]othic writer&quot;, Stevenson wrote a lot of grim stories. His most famous is &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;.

==Enduring appeal==
A testament to the enduring appeal of Larkin&#x27;s poem came in April 2009, when the first four lines were recited by a British appeal court judge as part of his judgement of a particularly acrimonious divorce case involving the future custody arrangements of a nine-year-old child. Lord Justice Wall referred to the emotional damage caused to the child, saying: &quot;These four lines seem to me to give a clear warning to parents who, post-separation, continue to fight the battles of the past, and show each other no respect.&quot;

==Cultural influences==
=== Literature ===
Poet Adrian Mitchell wrote an upbeat parody of the poem that begins with the lines &quot;They tuck you up, your Mum and Dad, / They read you Peter Rabbit, too.&quot;

The poem is extensively featured on Oliver James&#x27; books &quot;They F*** You Up&quot; (2002) and &quot;How Not To F*** Them Up&quot; (2010).

=== Music ===
Anne Clark set the poem to music and performed it on her albums &quot;Hopeless Cases&quot; (1987) and &quot;R.S.V.P.&quot; (1988).

The poem was set to music by Matthew Bannister for the album &quot;Hard Love Stories&quot; (1988) by New Zealand band Sneaky Feelings.

In a 2002 interview on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, David Bowie quoted the first and last stanzas, when asked about his relationship with his parents.

=== Television ===
Comedian Raphael Bob-Waksberg has cited the poem as an influence on his animated series BoJack Horseman (2014–2020).

The entire poem is recited in the &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; episode &quot;Mom City&quot; (2023). The first stanza is quoted in numerous TV series, including the &quot;Weeds&quot; episode &quot;Dearborn-Again&quot; (2010), the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; episode &quot;The Inspired&quot; (2013), the &quot;Succession&quot; episode &quot;Austerlitz&quot; (2018), and &quot;Firefly Lane&quot; episode &quot;Reborn on the Fourth of July&quot; (2022).

=== Film ===
The poem is recited by James McAvoy&#x27;s character in 2024&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;. 

=== Other ===
The streetwear brand Supreme printed the first stanza of the poem on items in their Fall/Winter 2016 collection.

<text>, better known as E. Honda, is a character created by Capcom for the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series. Introduced in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as part of the starting lineup, he has appeared in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; and the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, and made several cameos. Honda is a professional sumo wrestler and &quot;sentō&quot; proprietor. He is one of the original eight playable characters in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, representing Japan alongside Ryu.

==Conception and design==
Conceived by Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda, Honda was designed by Eri Nakamura, with oversight by Akiman due to how new she was at the company. Initially named &quot;Sumo&quot;, they wanted to give him a Japanese sounding name, considering &quot;Suzuki&quot; or &quot;Tanaka&quot; before settling on Honda, which they felt would be more familiar to Western audiences. The development team held a rock paper scissors match to pick who would work on which character with Nakamura coming in second and choosing him over &quot;the Beast&quot;, a character that would later become Blanka. The character was meant to have above average strength, but below average speed, and intended to be popular in Japan but to also make Japanese fighting styles appeal to foreigners. When creating his design and others for &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Akiman leaned heavily into the concepts of caricature and stereotypes to emphasize the contrast between the characters but also make them instantly recognizable, stating in an interview with Steve Hendershot &quot;subconsciously, I was adding elements with the idea that they could go viral. I wanted a reaction, and perfect things don&#x27;t instigate many reactions,” an idea partially influenced by his reaction to Mickey Rooney″s depiction of an Asian character in the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. To differentiate Honda from returning character Ryu, with design notes on the character stating &quot;We made him more &#x27;Japan&#x27; than necessary to make it clear to foreigners.&quot; Akiman additionally described him as &quot;a character I knew would create misunderstandings about Japan. And that&#x27;s exactly how I wanted to make him.&quot;

Standing 185 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall, early designs turned in resembled a regular sumo wrestler too closely and producer Akira Nishitani suggested they make him look more &quot;oriental&quot;, resulting in the additions of his yukata and kabuki face paint. Nakamura chose the latter in response to Akiman stating that his &quot;face was lacking&quot;, feeling the makeup would illustrate his pride for Japan, and even considered making him &quot;a hero for justice&quot; when fleshing out the concept. However, this caused some controversy after the game was released, as some outlets banned imagery of Honda due to some organizers feeling his facepaint was &quot;sacrilege to the Japanese national sport.&quot; Meanwhile, the yukata was intended to give him more of a distinctive look over just a traditional sumo wrestler&#x27;s belt, a detail Nakamura attributed to Akiman&#x27;s suggestion. While he has had a wide variety of secondary outfits in the later installments of the series, his appearance from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; has served as the basis for his primary outfit in each title, with only occasional minimal changes.

Akiman&#x27;s idea for Honda&#x27;s gameplay revolved around the idea of him rushing at his opponent, stating, &quot;I wanted the fat characters like Honda to come charging at you—for some reason. I feel that fat characters have a duty to charge.&quot; Nakamura took this concept and gave him his horizontal flying headbutt attack. Named &quot;Super Zutsuki&quot; in the notes she was given, she considered what made it super, and reasoned he had to fly. The concept completely surprised both Akiman and Nishanti, who saw it for the first time in game. Other attacks such as his Hundred Hand Slap, in which he attacks with a rapid flow of palm strikes, were fleshed out by the pixel artists on the team, and then drawn on paper by Nakamura.

==Appearances==
As introduced in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Honda is focused on becoming the greatest sumo wrestler of all time, and teaches sumo to several students. However, upon learning that the world outside of Japan did not consider sumo a true sport, he left his dojo and entered the martial arts tournament to prove that sumo wrestlers rank among the greatest fighters in the world.

Honda makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, during Sodom&#x27;s storyline. Sodom, obsessed with both Japanese culture and trying to revive Mad Gear, attempts to recruit sumo wrestlers, citing them as strong warriors. To achieve this, he enters a sumo wrestling competition and faces &quot;Fujinoyama&quot;, who is revealed to be Honda. Agreeing to the match, Honda defeats Sodom but is impressed by his effort nevertheless according to their dialogue in &quot;Alpha 3&quot;. In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, his storyline in this game serves more of a prologue to his appearance in Street Fighter II, with him traveling the world looking for strong opponents and to show the strength of sumo wrestling. Here he meets Ryu and has a sparring match with him and tells Sakura later on where she can find him. About this time he fights Sodom again in a friendly match as well. His wanderings lead him to Shadaloo&#x27;s base where he meets Zangief and while the actual extent of which is unknown the two are confirmed to have worked together to help destroy the base. In the aftermath he took in a few of Bison&#x27;s Dolls to give them somewhere to stay until they could regain their memories (which ones in particular is never exactly certain due to Capcom reusing sprites in his ending for the Dolls). According to this game&#x27;s ending and supported by his card profile in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS he may additionally have given them training in sumo during their stay, though none of his pupils in other games are female leaving this definitely up to question.

Honda returns for &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, which is set shortly after the events of the second World Warrior Tournament. His goals have not changed, as his bio states that he is fighting to promote the technique of sumo. To this end, he goes on a world tour. It is revealed that he is a &quot;haridashi-yokozuna&quot; (effectively meaning that he is of &quot;yokozuna&quot; level skill and achievement, but has yet to be officially promoted). His rival fight is against El Fuerte, after which the two share a meal. Honda returns in the fourth season of &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, having reopened the Honda Sento bathhouse and working to keep its guests happy. In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Honda opens a sumo-themed chanko restaurant called Chanko House Edomon in Metro City, which proves to be successful, thanks to Manon&#x27;s suggestion. Prior to open his restaurant outside Japan, Honda had a small friendly sumo match with Ryu, and have since been keeping in touch with him.

===In other media===
In the 1994 motion picture based on the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise, the role of Honda is played by Peter &quot;Navy&quot; Tuiasosopo. In the movie, Honda is portrayed as a close associate of Chun Li, serving as her news crew technician and programmer, while aiding her on her quest to avenge her father&#x27;s death alongside Balrog. Like Balrog, he has a personal grudge against Shadaloo, who ruined his reputation as a sumo (though no details on how are given). In the film&#x27;s climax he battles Zangief, smashing through Bison&#x27;s base. While he remains Japanese ethnically just like in the games, the film version is of mixed race, having Japanese and Polynesian heritage, and is native to Hawaii, just as many Japanese Americans are. His personality is rather laid back compared to his video game counterpart and is shown to have a near immunity to pain when one of Bison&#x27;s goons attempts to torture him, something he attributes to his discipline in sumo when Balrog asks about it. He does seem to enjoy fighting when he gets a chance to with Zangief, despite the degree of damage that it causes. This version of Honda appeared in both the arcade and console games based on the film. In his arcade ending it states that he returned to the world of professional sumo and regained the title of yokuzuna. The console game took this and expanded upon it, stating that he and Zangief had formed a friendship and had practice matches with Honda only having one win over Zangief. The outcomes of said matches however seem to be just as calamitous as their original bout, resulting in the destruction of five sumo dojos.

Honda appears as one of the more prominent characters to appear in the second half of &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, unlike a majority of the characters that were not heavily involved in the backstory of the game. He is voiced by Daisuke Gori in the original Japanese version and by Richard Epcar in the English dub. His personality is relatively unchanged from that in the games, however his goal is shown to be to fight for cash compared to his in-game goal of proving the strength of sumo to the world. Several aspects of his character appearance here saw usage in the Street Fighter Alpha series much like many other characters, but more so in the Capcom vs. SNK games, where outright nods (such as his run animation being a direct copy of his attempt to charge into Bison) were included in the game. He is first seen wrestling with Dhalsim in Calcutta to win prize money. Dhalsim manages to slip away from his grip however, and attempts to mentally subdue Honda. Ryu&#x27;s presence however distracts Dhalsim enough for Honda to regain control of the match and win due to forfeit. Honda catches up with Ryu, recognizing he helped him win and the fact Ryu is a fellow Japanese fighter, giving him half the prize money as well as a place to stay for a while. Near the movie&#x27;s climax, Guile and Bison find Ryu while he is with Honda in the mountains. While Ryu tries to deal with a brainwashed Ken, Honda charges forward to take on Bison, only for Bison to teleport out of his path and Ken strikes him which sends him stumbling forward, straight into Balrog. He and Balrog end up fighting, eventually with both of them falling off a nearby cliff. However Honda seems to recover quickly enough, seen lugging both the unconscious Balrog and Guile (who was knocked out by Bison) back just as Ryu and Ken apparently defeat Bison.

Paul Dobson voices Honda in the animated series, where he works for the team as a computer whiz.

==Promotion and reception==
In 1993, a Honda action figure was made as part of the G.I. Joe &quot;Street Fighter&quot; line, with a variant later released for the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; live action movie. The figure is unique compared to the others: no parts were reused to make it, requiring a unique mold to be made due to his size. The character&#x27;s legs could be squeezed together to have the upper body bend down in a headbutt motion and was jointed to allow kids to recreate his Hundred Hand Slap move. Another action figure was released in 2008 as part of SOTA&#x27;s Revolutions Series 1, with a limited edition variant using his &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; colors. The figure featured a positionable waist, arms, and legs, and an alternate head for a different facial expression.

Honda was well received since his debut. Elisa Rodriguez of &quot;Dualshockers&quot; described his fighting style and watching it evolve has been &quot;fascinating&quot;, adding &quot;He is a perfect example to showcase how sumo wrestlers would fight if they practiced elements of MMA.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described him as a likeable guy, &quot;one of those guys who laughs way too hard while smacking you on the back and dislocating your shoulder&quot;. They further added that Honda didn&#x27;t stand out against other sumo wrestlers in video games, until they played him off other loud, proud wrestlers. Sergio Sánchez Trujillo of &quot;RetroManiac&quot; stated that while Honda is a sumo wrestler, he felt some of his moves were taken from Judo, and compared his aggressive fighting style to that of actor Bud Spencer, both factors that encouraged him to become a better player when using the character and his fondness for him. He noted that while the series did add an actual Judo practitioner years later, Abel, &quot;it was already too late. Edmond had won my heart.&quot;

&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; briefly cited him as an example of body positivity within the franchise, in light of another series character, Rufus. &quot;Paste&quot; further elaborated on this point, stating &quot;The joy of Edmund Honda can often be highly personal; he&#x27;s the one overweight character in the series who doesn&#x27;t feel like a joke,&quot; and added &quot;His moderate size and the way his muscle accentuates his weight instead of undermining it (see Rufus for an example of what we mean) give him an air of respectability.&quot; They added he &quot;gives the overweight people among us someone to latch onto amidst all the other examples of overweight characters telling us we should be ashamed of ourselves. [...] E. Honda owns his physique in a way no other character does, and for that he&#x27;ll always be one of our favorites.&quot;

===In academic study===
Honda&#x27;s character and design has also been the topic of academic study. University of Delaware professor Rachael Hutchinson noted that in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; Honda acted in part as a Japanese caricature, in part due to the &quot;Rising Sun&quot; imagery used in his stage, describing it as a parody of Japanese nationalism but also a more pointed representation of Japan than fellow Japanese character Ryu. Coupled with his Hundred Hand Slap which tied his sumo technique &quot;into the exotic atmospheres of other nations&quot;, she felt these aspects were done to help establish Ryu as the &quot;&#x27;regular, everyday Japanese&#x27; fighter, reassuring the player of normalcy in the crazy world of Yasuda&#x27;s imagination&quot; in contrast to Honda. 

Meanwhile, the book &quot;Convergent Wrestling&quot; noted that his addition along with Zangief in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; set the game apart from other fighting game titles at the time, due to their role as wrestlers, which helped legitimize wrestling among other martial arts. It further described Honda&#x27;s look as both &quot;simple and iconic&quot;, specifically noting his facepaint, a style known as &quot;kumadori&quot; used in kabuki theatre, signifying Honda as &quot;noble and heroic&quot;, while his yukata emphasized that he was non-traditional, as sumo wrestlers tend to not wear anything over their belts in competition. They also noted that his Hundred Hand Slap embodied the primary win conditions of sumo wrestling, pushing the opponent out of the ring, and allowed the player to more properly step into the role of a sumo wrestler when playing as him.

In Nicholas Ware&#x27;s paper &quot;&quot;You Must Defeat Shen Long To Stand a Chance&quot;: Street Fighter, Race, Play, and Player&quot;, he cited a more direction connection between sumo and kabuki theater made by other scholars, and that his design was composed of multiple cultural signifiers to the Japanese: national sport, traditional theater, and everyday Japanese life. He further described Honda&#x27;s image as cartoonish, noting his constant use of a deep stance, even when moving, despite sumo matches usually at most only lasting a short period of time. He added that his attire was a bit garish, due to real-life wrestlers only wearing such during ceremonial occasions, but added that his &quot;out-of-place, yet real aspects are emblematic of how &quot;Street Fighter&quot; treats semiotic markers of race and culture. [...] E. Honda is &#x27;Japanese&#x27; in visage, but simply pop culture in construction—he recalls Japan thought his image and supposed profession but is a product of a hybrid, international popular culture aesthetic.&quot;

<text>The kting voar, also known as the khting vor, linh dương, or snake-eating cow is a bovid mammal reputed to exist in Cambodia and Vietnam. The kting voar&#x27;s existence as a real species should be regarded as questionable, and it is now thought to simply be a hoax made from water buffalo horns.

== Characteristics ==
The kting voar is normally described as a cow-like animal with peculiar twisting horns about long and spotted fur. It often has some sort of connection with snakes, varying between stories.

== Names ==
Kting voar is the animal&#x27;s Cambodian name. This was erroneously translated in the West as &#x27;jungle sheep&#x27;, leading to a mistaken assumption that the animal was related to sheep and goats.

Adding to the confusion, the Vietnamese name &quot;linh dương&quot; meaning (&#x27;antelope&#x27;) or (&#x27;gnu&#x27;) was once reported to refer to this animal. However, this is in fact a local name of the mainland serow.

Other Kampuchean names possibly include &quot;kting sipuoh&quot; (&#x27;snake-eating cattle&#x27;) and &quot;khting pôs&quot;. The Latinized binomial &quot;Pseudonovibos spiralis&quot; is invalid, given that the holotype for the species was identified as a domesticated cow. However, the name would mean c.f. &#x27;fake new cattle&#x27; with &#x27;spiral&#x27; horns.

== Controversy ==
For Western scientists, the first evidence supporting the kting voar&#x27;s existence was a set of horns found by biologist Wolfgang Peter in a Ho Chi Minh City market (Peter &amp; Feiler, 1994a). The horns were so unusual that Peter believed them to belong to a new species (Peter &amp; Feiler, 1994b).

No anatomical information, except for horns and frontlets, is available, so the phylogenetic status of the kting voar has been uncertain. Peter &amp; Feiler (1994a) proposed the relationships of &quot;P. spiralis&quot; with Antilopini, but morphological analyses by Dioli (1995, 1997) and Timm &amp; Brandt (2001) suggest affinities within Bovini, while Nadler (1997) believed &quot;P. spiralis&quot; to be related to Caprini. Genetic studies using alleged kting voar specimens have produced confusing results (Hammer et al., 1999; Kuznetsov et al., 2001a,b, 2002). However, these results from DNA have been demonstrated to be cases of DNA contamination (Hassanin &amp; Douzery, 2000; Hassanin, 2002; Olson &amp; Hassanin, 2003).

All supposed kting voar specimens that were subject to DNA analysis to date have turned out to be artificially shaped cattle horns (Hassanin et al., 2001; Thomas, Seveau, and Hassanin, 2001; Hassanin, 2002). The most likely explanation, given the DNA testing results and the unusual spotted fur (which is well known in domesticated, but unknown in wild cattle), seem to be that modern specimens at least are cattle horns shaped by a complicated technique in order to serve as anti-snake talismans.

The controversy over the existence of &quot;P. spiralis&quot; was covered in Nature (Whitfield, 2002), New York Times (Mydans, 2002), and Science (Malakoff, 2001).

There is also an earlier report of British tiger-hunters in the first part the 20th century, who observed kting voar and shot two as tiger bait.

Skeptical opinion is that the kting voar is a mythical animal. Cow horns are often sold as imitation kting voar horns in Kampuche markets. However, some scientists, notably American mammalogist Dr. Robert Timm, consider it probable that the root of the folklore is a real, distinct species of wild bovid, such as the kouprey (Brandt et al., 2001; Timm &amp; Brandt, 2001). If so, this animal would be highly endangered or more probably recently extinct, because rampant hunting and deforestation decimated populations of other big mammals in the region.

More recently, Feiler et al. (2002) established that most of the horn sheaths of the kting voar, including the holotype were superficially embellished, but added that it remains to be seen whether these horns belong to cattle or a distinct species in its own right.

Until further evidence is obtained, the kting voar&#x27;s existence as a real species should be regarded as questionable (Galbreath &amp; Melville, 2003).

<text>The [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] of [[Nova Scotia]] (informally and more commonly, the Cabinet of Nova Scotia) is the cabinet of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

Almost always made up of members of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the cabinet is similar in structure and role to the federal Canadian cabinet, though smaller in size with different portfolios.

The Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, as representative of the King in Right of Nova Scotia, heads the executive council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Other members are selected by the Premier of Nova Scotia and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a department, but this is not always the case.

==Current cabinet==
The current ministry has been in place since October 24, 2024, following the resignation of Allan MacMaster as Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance.

<text>Lenore Tamara Danz (14 December 1952 – 22 July 1996) was the lead singer and lyricist of the East German rock group Silly. She succumbed to breast cancer at the age of 43.

==Life==
Danz was born in Breitungen, Bezirk Suhl. Her childhood was spent in Romania and Bulgaria. She made her singing debut in 1971 in East Berlin with the band Die Cropies. After two years at university, she broke off her linguistics studies; however, her application to the Hochschule für Musik &quot;Hanns Eisler&quot; was rejected. She continued to sing with various bands, including the Oktoberklub, a politically oriented vocal group. Finally, in 1977 she received her diploma from the Friedrichshain School of Music, following three years of study; this was necessary in East Germany to perform as a professional musician.

In 1978, she joined the band Familie Silly, which was renamed Silly in 1980. In 1981 Danz was chosen as best female rock singer in East Germany (&quot;Rocklady Nr. 1 der DDR&quot;), and again in 1983, 1985, and 1986.

Danz was the singer of the all-star band in 1986, where she became acquainted with guitarist Uwe Hassbecker of Stern Meissen, who would later become her partner and would join Silly later in the year. With the Gitarreros she performed a duet of Bryan Adams and Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; with of .

==Other==
On 18 September 1989, she was a co-author and signatory of the &quot;Resolution der Rockmusiker und Liedermacher&quot; (Resolution of Rock Musicians and Songwriters). This was a petition to the GDR government, in which political reforms and the legalization of opposition political groups were demanded. Danz read the text illegally at concerts. In 1990, she was on several different round tables for the reform of the GDR.

==Last years and death==
Danz was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995, during the recording of Silly&#x27;s final album, &quot;Paradies&quot;. She married Uwe Hassbecker shortly before her death on 22 July 1996, aged 43.

<text>Silly is a German rock band. Founded in East Germany in 1977, Silly was one of the country&#x27;s most popular music acts, and was well known for its charismatic lead singer Tamara Danz. Her death in 1996 ended the band&#x27;s recording career after 18 years. In 2005 the surviving members began to perform as Silly again, first with several guest singers, before choosing actress Anna Loos to replace Danz. The first album with the new line-up, &quot;Alles Rot&quot;, became the band&#x27;s most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts in 2010.

==Band history==
The band was founded in East Berlin in 1977 as Familie Silly (The Silly Family) by guitarist Thomas Fritzsching and bassist Mathias Schramm, evolving from Fritzsching&#x27;s previous band Phönix. They added &quot;Familie&quot; to the band&#x27;s name after East German authorities refused to allow Silly by itself, as they saw it as an anglicism; the band claimed that Silly was the name of their mascot, a cat, who behaved in a silly manner.

The early band also consisted of keyboardists Ulrich Mann and Manfred Kusno and drummer Mike Schafmeier. They recruited singer Tamara Danz, the daughter of a diplomat who had previously studied linguistics; she had previously worked as a singer in both the Oktoberklub, a politically charged vocal group, and the , a popular progressive rock ensemble.

Silly&#x27;s first notable concert appearances outside East Germany were in Romania, where the band gained a strong following; it helped that Fritzsching and Danz could speak Romanian fluently. They participated in several music festivals, and in 1981 won the Lyra in Bratislava, the communist bloc&#x27;s best-known music prize (akin to the Sanremo Music Festival). The band was also allowed to perform in Norway.

Unusually, the band&#x27;s first, self-titled album was released first in West Germany in 1981, where it sold moderately well; this was due in part to the enthusiasm of West German record promoters (including photographer Jim Rakete) for the band, in contrast to the East German state record label Amiga&#x27;s reluctance to produce an album.

After the album was released, the band made the acquaintance of poet , who would write the lyrics for the band&#x27;s albums until 1989. His complex and often politically charged lyrics gave the band a strong intellectual appeal, but frequently landed them in trouble with the censors, who demanded changes before allowing a song to be performed. With the West German album a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, Amiga was forced to issue it domestically, as &quot;Tanzt keiner Boogie?&quot; (Isn&#x27;t Anyone Going to Boogie?), where it was immensely popular; the revised version dropped two songs in favor of two new recordings with lyrics by Karma, one of which, the atypical &quot;Der letzte Kunde&quot; (The Last Customer), a paean to alcoholism sung by drummer Schafmeier, became the early band&#x27;s signature tune.

In 1982, Danz&#x27;s then-boyfriend Rüdiger &quot;Ritchie&quot; Barton joined the band, replacing its two keyboardists. His first appearance was a note-for-note cover version of Kim Carnes&#x27; hit &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, which, following long-standing practice, the state recording label Amiga issued to avoid having to pay performance royalties for the original song. While it earned the band substantial publicity, they showed their evident unhappiness with it by performing it on television dressed as schoolchildren eating ice cream (&quot;Eis&quot;, in German, is pronounced much as &quot;eyes&quot;). The song was the only Silly release not to be in German; it was also their last release under the name &quot;Familie Silly&quot;.

Barton&#x27;s synthesizer playing lent a new wave edge to the band&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;&quot;, named for the &quot;rubbish mountain&quot; in Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichshain district that was built over the debris of a World War II flak tower in a park of the neighbourhood. The title track, a massive hit in East Germany, is typical of Karma&#x27;s narrative writing style, with several overtones. It concerns a conversation between two women, one old and one young; the younger one thanks the city fathers for the hill, which for her is only as a place to catch some fresh air; the older replies to her that it was the city mothers – Germany&#x27;s &quot;Trümmerfrauen&quot; – who had built the hill from the city ruins.

&quot;Mont Klamott&quot; was voted East Germany&#x27;s Album of the Year, cementing Silly&#x27;s popularity. At the time, the band toured constantly, spending most of its time on the road. Schafmeier was forced to leave the band for health reasons, and he took the band&#x27;s best-known song &quot;Der letzte Kunde&quot; with him, joining the cabaret trio MTS. He was replaced by Herbert Junck, formerly of NO 55.

Silly&#x27;s censorship problem became more acute in 1985 when their planned album &quot;Zwischen unbefahr&#x27;nen Gleisen&quot; (Between Untraveled Tracks; presumably those between the two German states), was blocked by East German officials, who had taken exception to the &quot;subversive&quot; message of several tracks.

It was eventually released as &quot;Liebeswalzer&quot; (Waltz of Love), containing rewritten lyrics. The offending songs, &quot;Tausend Augen&quot; (&quot;Thousand Eyes&quot;), &quot;Nur ein Lied&quot; (&quot;Only a Song&quot;), and the title track, were re-recorded with new lyrics and arrangements and renamed &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Großer Träumer&quot; (&quot;Big Dreamer&quot;), and &quot;Berliner Frühling&quot; (&quot;Berlin Spring&quot;). In 1990, as East Germany was in its dying days, &quot;Liebeswalzer&quot; was re-released with the three songs in their original form. The unaltered album was finally released on CD with both versions, in 1994.

Despite the controversy, &quot;Liebeswalzer&quot; again was voted Album of the Year, and Silly won one argument with the censors over the word &quot;Titten&quot; (tits) in the song &quot;So &#x27;ne kleine Frau&quot; (Such a Little Woman), which was left unaltered.

Bassist Jäcki Reznicek, formerly of Pankow, played fretless bass on the title track to the next album, &quot;Bataillon d&#x27;Amour&quot; (Battalion of Love, 1986), which proved to be one of the best-known songs ever to come out of East Germany (the main bass line was played by Schramm). The album was released on CBS Records in West Germany, although CBS rejected the East German cover artwork as amateurish and supplied their own. The song &quot;Schlohweißer Tag&quot; (Snow White Day) was later used in Heiner Carow&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Coming Out&quot;. After the album was released, Schramm was asked to leave the band, and was replaced by Reznicek.

Following the success of &quot;Bataillon d&#x27;Amour&quot;, the band took a two-year break from recording, during which they split with Karma. He contributed only two songs to Silly&#x27;s next effort, &quot;Februar&quot;, released in that month in 1989 (in West Germany; the domestic release was a month later). After a falling out with Werner Karma, Danz sought the assistance of up-and-coming singer-songwriter Gerhard Gundermann in writing lyrics, who had already drawn notice for his witty wordplay on his 1988 debut album. Recorded in West Berlin, the album was, like its predecessor, state-of-the-art, and as a co-production with a West German label, there was, for the first time, no censorship. Joining the band was guitarist Uwe Hassbecker, Danz&#x27;s new paramour, formerly of Stern Meißen, whom she had met while singing in the East German supergroup, &quot;Die Gitarreros&quot;, in 1986. His heavy metal-inspired playing contrasted with Thomas Fritzsching&#x27;s more melodic approach, causing Fritzsching to be marginalized; although technically the bandleader, he was excluded from the recording sessions.

Again, it was released on a West German label, this time Ariola, and again the cover artwork was replaced with a more sophisticated version. While not an enormous hit in the west, the track &quot;Verlorene Kinder&quot; (&quot;Lost Children&quot;) received some airplay. The Song is about children, who living in dysfunctional families. The song was only able to release in East Germany, because the critic of the song was officially seen as critic on West Berlin conditions. The track &quot;Ein Gespenst geht um&quot; (A Ghost Haunts), an oblique political commentary which drew on a quotation by Karl Marx about political change in the air (although the ghost here haunted a Mitropa restaurant rather than &quot;Europa&quot;), and the song seemed somewhat prescient in light of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November that year. Also &quot;Über ihr taute das Eis&quot; (&quot;The ice thawed over her&quot;) was an unusual song for East german conditions, telling the story of a minor girls suicide.

However, the end of communism did not lead to a breakthrough for Silly. Although Danz had petitioned the East German government for change during 1989, and illegally read out petitions during the band&#x27;s concerts, interest in East German bands plummeted after 9 November 1989, when East Germans were able to cross into West Germany and easily get their hands on western rock music. Danz performed as a backup singer at a massive free concert featuring the likes of Joe Cocker following the Wall opening. She later expressed skepticism that her involvement with the Neues Forum reform movement had produced any results.

At the same time, however, the West German label Ariola believed Silly could be turned into a household name across all of Germany. The band were invited to Bavaria to work on a new album. But Danz felt constrained by the Ariola executives, who deemed the band&#x27;s songs not commercial, and provided them with chart-friendly music and lyrics by outside writers. Silly walked out.

Instead, Silly&#x27;s next album would be the self-produced &quot;Hurensöhne&quot; (Sons of Bitches), released in 1993 on DSB, the successor label to the state-run Amiga. Again, the lyrics were penned by Danz and Gundermann, separately and together; as the album&#x27;s title suggests, they were angry. The song &quot;Neider&quot; (The Enviers) addresses the band&#x27;s treatment at the hands of Ariola. The album closer, &quot;Traumpaar&quot; (Dream Couple) imagines the two German states as a dancing pair, &quot;die Schlampe und der Held&quot; – the whore and the hero.

Largely ignored in western Germany, &quot;Hurensöhne&quot; reestablished Silly as an important band in the east, as fans returned in droves amid disillusionment with German reunification. The group&#x27;s concerts once again sold out. After the album, Danz, Hassbecker, and Barton began building their own recording studio in Berlin, named Danzmusik. Fritzsching, the band&#x27;s founder, whose guitar contributions had become overshadowed by those of Hassbecker, was asked to leave the band.

Late during the recording for the follow-up, &quot;Paradies&quot;, in 1995, Danz was diagnosed with breast cancer. Although she was operated on immediately, the disease had spread, and she refused chemotherapy, instead choosing an ineffective alternative medicine treatment. She died the following July, five months after the album had come out. Shortly before her death, she married Hassbecker, her live-in partner of many years; she said this was in part to avoid taxes on her share of the studio.

&quot;Paradies&quot; was the first album on which Danz alone had written the lyrics, and several of its song seem to reflect on her impending death, although Danz denied this, saying that the words had been written before her diagnosis. The album was photographed by the band&#x27;s old friend Jim Rakete. Despite minimal publicity, and the lack, for obvious reasons, of a tour, it sold reasonably well, and its title track became a radio hit.

The band did not break up after Danz&#x27;s death; the remaining members (Barton, Hassbecker, Rezniczek, and Junck) completed two unfinished tracks for inclusion on a pair of greatest hits albums, the first of which sold well over 100,000 copies, no small achievement for a compilation of an East German band. The remaining members performed Silly&#x27;s songs on tour on two occasions, the first &quot;borrowing&quot; singer from the band City for a number of one-off performances, and in 2005 using several well-known singers on a German tour promoted as a tribute to both Danz and Junck, who had died of cancer earlier in the year.

In 2006 Hassbecker, Barton, and Reznicek announced a new electro-acoustic tour with actress and singer Anna Loos; the live band included Reznicek&#x27;s son Bastian on drums, Hassbecker&#x27;s son Daniel on cello, and former guitarist . Initially billed as &quot;Silly with Anna Loos&quot;, the band asked Loos to join the band permanently following the tour.

At Loos&#x27; suggestion, the band approached, and reconciled with, lyricist Werner Karma. In early 2010, the band, which had no members from its original lineup, released its first new album since 1996, &quot;Alles Rot&quot; (Everything Red), with all its lyrics written by Karma. Thanks in part to the attention drawn by Loos, Silly was able to sign to the major label Universal Music. The album proved to be the band&#x27;s most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts, and the band toured to numerous sold-out venues.

==Legacy==

In 1998, singer Joachim Witt had a hit in Germany with a cover version of &quot;Bataillon d&#x27;Amour.&quot; The Polish goth metal band was also named for the song. A street in Berlin was named after Tamara Danz.

<text>The Joe DiMaggio Highway, commonly called the West Side Highway and formerly the Miller Highway, is a mostly surface section of New York State Route 9A (NY 9A), running from West 72nd Street along the Hudson River to the southern tip of Manhattan in New York City. It replaced the West Side Elevated Highway, built between 1929 and 1951, was shut down in 1973 due to neglect and lack of maintenance, and was dismantled by 1989. North of 72nd Street, the roadway continues as the Henry Hudson Parkway.

The current highway was complete by 2001, but required reconstruction after the September 11 attacks that year, when the collapse of the World Trade Center caused debris to fall onto the surrounding areas, damaging the highway. It uses the surface streets that existed before the elevated highway was built: West Street, Eleventh Avenue and Twelfth Avenue. A short section of Twelfth Avenue still runs between 125th and 138th Streets, under the Riverside Drive Viaduct. Eleventh Avenue is a separate street north of 22nd Street. The portion between West 42nd Street and Canal Street is part of the Lincoln Highway.

==Route description==
The highway is a six-to-eight lane urban boulevard, with the northernmost section, from 59th Street to 72nd Street (signed as the Henry Hudson Parkway), a freeway elevated above a former rail yard adjacent to tracks still used by Amtrak. Trucks and buses are allowed only on the surface section. The West Side Highway&#x27;s surface section takes three names: West Street from the Battery Park Underpass north to Tenth Avenue, then Eleventh Avenue to 22nd Street, and finally Twelfth Avenue to 72nd Street.

===West Street===

The highway begins from Battery Park close to the mouth of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel where it also accepts traffic from the southern terminus of FDR Drive. From there, the route passes close to the site of the World Trade Center at Vesey Street. The route continues with this name passing by numerous piers along the Hudson River until Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District where it becomes Eleventh Avenue.

===Eleventh Avenue===

Eleventh Avenue begins just north of the intersection with Tenth Avenue. The highway is concurrent with Eleventh Avenue north of this point, passing by the 14th Street Park at 14th Street. The highway continues with this name alongside the Chelsea Piers until it reaches 22nd Street where the highway branches off from Eleventh Avenue onto Twelfth Avenue.

===Twelfth Avenue===

At 22nd Street, the highway continues as Twelfth Avenue passing by the Chelsea Waterside Park. It passes just west of the Javits Center from 34th Street to 38th Street and over the Lincoln Tunnel at 39th Street. The road continues past the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum and Piers 84 to 92, a major cruise ship terminal building. At 59th Street, the highway becomes an elevated freeway and at 72nd Street, the highway becomes the Henry Hudson Parkway.

==West Side Elevated Highway==
Various proposals circulated in the 1920s to build an expressway on the west side. Among the proposals:

* Rail/Highway Double Decker – The New York Central Railroad proposed building a highway/rail double decked highway from 72nd Street to Canal Street, which would be constructed privately at no cost to the city. It would eliminate 106 grade crossings over 84 blocks. It ran into opposition because of fears that it would create a rail monopoly.
* Hencken&#x27;s Ten-story Train/Car/Office/People Mover – Engineer John Hencken proposed an exotic ten-story complex with a rail line underground, a road at street level, and a people mover built above that, topped by ten stories of apartments and offices. The highway would run on top of the ten-story buildings.

Manhattan borough president Julius Miller said that something had to be done right away and ultimately pushed through the plan for the West Side Elevated Highway, which was to eventually bear his name. The proposal immediately ran into stiff opposition. The City Club and New York City Mayor James J. Walker objected to the highway on the grounds that it would block waterfront-bound freight traffic. At the time, West Street exhibited a &quot;daily avalanche of freight and passengers in traffic&quot;, and was &quot;walled by an unbroken line of bulkhead sheds and dock structures&quot; blocking the view not only of the river, but even of the ships being serviced, and the commerce carried out on those piers and slips was vital to the economic health of the city. They believed that the plans should wait until the surface railroad tracks were removed in the area, at which point the elevated highway might not be necessary. Many objected that it would be ugly. Finally, in 1929, construction started, and the section between Canal Street and West 72nd Street was completed in 1937, with a &quot;Southern Extension&quot; to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel completed in 1951.

===Robert Moses proposals===
Having begun at Canal Street in 1929, implementation of the elevated roadway had progressed as far as Midtown by the time that Robert Moses became NYC Parks Commissioner and took a direct interest in local projects by 1934. However, Moses created significant works extending from the north and south ends of the West Side Highway, including:

* Henry Hudson Parkway – The West Side Highway becomes the Henry Hudson Parkway just north of 72nd Street thanks to efforts by Moses called the &quot;West Side Improvement.&quot; The parkway does not permit trucks. The parkway is partially an elevated highway over the rail tracks (now used by Amtrak).
* Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel – The highway hooks into the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel at its southern end. Moses had proposed to create the &quot;Brooklyn–Battery Crossing Bridge&quot; but federal intervention obliged Moses to use a tunnel instead.
* Battery Park Underpass connects to FDR Drive.

In the 1960s, Moses proposed straightening the West Side Highway, widening both the highway and the Henry Hudson Parkway, and constructing both the Lower Manhattan Expressway and the Mid-Manhattan Expressways, connecting routes that would have stretched across Manhattan. None of these projects were ever built. Later, in his 80s, he opposed the Westway project, but by that time his power was gone and his ideas generally weren&#x27;t taken seriously. Rather than constructing a below-grade interstate highway, Moses proposed merely straightening and rebuilding the West Side Highway south of 59th Street. Between 59th and 72nd Streets, the site of the former Penn Central 60th Street rail yard, he proposed bringing the highway to grade and moving it eastward to allow for a waterfront park and some housing at the southeast corner of the rail yard. This was the nucleus of the idea that led to the plan for Riverside South.

===1973 collapse===
The highway was not designed well, resulting in many shortcomings. Its lanes were considered too narrow and it could not accommodate trucks. Sharp &quot;S&quot; exit ramps proved hazardous, as did the left-hand exit and entrance lanes that made merging dangerous.

On December 15, 1973, the northbound lanes between Little West 12th Street and Gansevoort Street collapsed under the weight of a dump truck, which was carrying over of asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway. A four-door sedan followed the truck through the hole; neither driver was seriously injured. The next day, both directions were &#x27;indefinitely&#x27; closed south of 18th Street. This not only closed off the oldest section (between Canal Street and 18th Street), but also the newest sections (south of Canal Street), because ramps south of the collapse only permitted northbound entrances and southbound exits. The southernmost northbound exit was at 23rd Street.

==Westway==
In 1971, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) proposed rebuilding the highway as Interstate 478. UDC&#x27;s &quot;Water Edge Study&quot; called for the highway to be routed above the water at the ends of the then mostly abandoned piers on the Hudson River and the addition of hundreds of acres of concrete platforms between the bulkhead and the pierhead lines for parks and apartments. The final plan, championed by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Mayor John Lindsay, called for burying the six-lane highway in of new landfill south of 40th Street, placing the accompanying development on land instead of on platforms. It was renamed &quot;Westway&quot; in 1974.

Hugh Carey, who was to become governor, and Ed Koch, who was to become mayor, both campaigned against the plan, saying that it would be a waste of government funds and would be a windfall for private developers. After the two were elected, they both reversed their position and supported the plan.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Department of Transportation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers were on board for the construction with a 1981 price tag of $2.1 billion.

But in 1982, Judge Thomas Griesa of the U.S. District Court blocked the Corps permit, saying the road would harm striped bass. His order was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August 1985, Judge Griesa ruled that state and federal agencies had provided tainted testimony regarding the striped bass. At the same time, Congress moved to deny necessary funding for the landfill.

On September 30, 1985, New York City officially gave up on the project, allocating 60 percent of its interstate highway funds to mass transit and setting aside $811 million for the &quot;West Side Highway Replacement Project&quot;.

==Riverside South==

In the 1970s, debates raged about what to do with the elevated section from West 72nd Street and 59th Street. One version of Westway would have continued the buried highway up to the George Washington Bridge, eliminating the elevated section between 59th and 72nd streets, as well as the Henry Hudson Parkway. That option was rejected because of the cost and because it would violate the Blumenthal Amendment, which prohibited any highway construction that would alter Riverside Park. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) rejected former parks commissioner Robert Moses&#x27;s proposal to relocate the elevated section to grade also because of the Blumenthal Amendment as well as the presumed negative effect on development opportunities. Donald Trump, who had an option on the property, seized on Moses&#x27;s proposal as a way to enhance his development plans, thus negating one of NYSDOT&#x27;s objections, but his proposed 12,000-unit residential development went nowhere. So NYSDOT planned for a renovation of the viaduct.
A subsequent development project, &quot;Lincoln West&quot;, accepted the elevated highway, but, although Lincoln West won approval from the City, it failed to obtain financing. Later, Trump acquired the property and proposed Television City, a design based on a massive 13-block-long podium to hide the elevated highway. Responding to criticism, Trump switched architects, reduced the podium to eight blocks in length, and changed the name to Trump City.

Six civic organizations opposed to Trump City proposed a plan that would relocate and bury the highway in conjunction with a much smaller development and a southward extension of Riverside Park. Trump eventually agreed to this plan, known as Riverside South. After city approval in 1992, work began on the new apartment complex.

As part of the Riverside South agreement, the Urban Development Corporation proceeded with planning and environmental studies for a relocated highway. But relocating and burying the elevated highway section became politically complicated when, at the same time, NYSDOT went ahead with its $70 million project to straighten, widen, and reinforce the viaduct. In 2005 Trump&#x27;s majority partners sold the project to the Carlyle Group and Extell Development Company. In June 2006, the new developer began construction of a tunnel between 61st and 65th streets for the relocated highway.

==West Side Highway Replacement Project==

Following the end of the Westway project, there were debates on what to do about the rest of the highway. Vollmer Associates was contracted for the highway replacement project in September 1986. There were four alternatives: three at-grade options with a varying number of lanes and quality of roadway, and one option with grade-separated ramps over busy intersections. By November, a commission was set up to discuss the alternatives. Four days later, several sections of the highway were agreed on. It would be an elevated highway north of 49th Street; an at-grade roadway between 44th and 25th Streets, including a depressed northbound roadway from 32nd to 42nd Streets; a tunnel under a park between 20th and 25th Streets; an at-grade boulevard between 20th and Houston Streets; an at-grade road with a 3-lane elevated ramp between Houston and Harrison Streets; and a 9-lane boulevard with depressed ramps through Battery Park City. There would be 26 traffic lights. This proposal was assailed by mass-transit associations, environmental groups, and elected officials.
In January 1987, the commission unanimously agreed to build the highway as a six-lane urban boulevard with a parkway-style median and decorative lightposts. There would be a $100 million park on the highway&#x27;s western periphery, the latter of which was criticized by Governor Mario Cuomo as being too expensive. Afterward, there were some delays caused by Cuomo&#x27;s reluctance to prioritize the project. In the meantime, the old, abandoned highway was being used by squatters. One of the first options to be rejected in 1989 was the construction of a boulevard on landfill, which was the reason for Westway&#x27;s cancellation. There were also proposals for &quot;cove&quot; developments alongside the future boulevard.

Construction began in early 1996 on the West Side Highway project. The first of the project&#x27;s seven segments—between Clarkson and Horatio streets in the Greenwich Village neighborhood—was completed in 1998.

Construction of the West Side Highway Replacement Project was completed between the Battery and 59th Street in August 2001. The period between the 1973 collapse and the 1985 demise of Westway was a chaotic time for drivers as the original elevated highway was dismantled (finally in 1989) and traffic was rerouted to temporary highways. The new highway permits trucks, which the old elevated did not. Together with the northern Henry Hudson Parkway, it creates a leafy boulevard along the Hudson River from the northern tip to the southern tip of Manhattan.

===Hudson River Park===

Legislation in June 1998 followed an agreement by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor George Pataki to create the Hudson River Park on the west side of the highway from West 59th to the Battery. The park consists of and is the biggest park construction in the city since Central Park. A bicycle path running the length of the highway to Battery Park City was one of the first additions. Piers are currently being refurbished and other work continues, with Pier 84 as the largest.

===Joe DiMaggio Highway===
Even though the highway has had two other official names, the official names have never stuck. The first official name was the Miller Highway, in honor of the city council president who pushed for the highway. On March 30, 1999, at the urging of Mayor Giuliani, the highway was renamed for legendary New York Yankees player Joe DiMaggio, who had died three weeks earlier. Legislation to rename the highway had been introduced before DiMaggio died. Giuliani championed the name change because the highway would have been the approach to the proposed West Side Stadium at the highway and 32nd Street. DiMaggio lived on Manhattan&#x27;s east side.

Signs bearing the new, ceremonial name of the highway were erected on April 25, 1999. This was in the midst of a reconstruction, finished on March 29, 2002, after the September 11 attacks in 2001 destroyed part of the road, which was still being rebuilt. Only minimal signage for the new name was erected as a result, while &quot;West Side Highway&quot; signs abound.

=== September 11, 2001, and aftermath===

Completion of the project was originally set for October 2001, but it was delayed for years due to damage caused by the September 11 attacks. The highway, which runs just west of the World Trade Center, played a major role in the September 11, 2001 attacks and its aftermath. The famous flag raising photograph by Thomas E. Franklin of &quot;The Record&quot; took place by the highway on the northwest corner of the site. In addition, three chunks of the tower that crashed into the highway were used in iconic pictures of the day. Emergency personnel went down the West Side Highway and were greeted by cheering crowds at Christopher Street on their return. Virtually all the debris from the Center traveled up the West Side Highway to be shipped off by barge. For the last half of the month, out-of-town ambulances waited on the highway for a chance to help injured patients.

There was debate over whether to rebuild the damaged section of the road as a surface street or a tunnel. As a master plan was developed for Ground Zero, plans initially called for the West Side Highway to be buried in a tunnel between the site and Battery Park City that was expected to cost $1 billion. Goldman Sachs, which had planned to build its headquarters in Battery Park City, announced its intention to cancel those plans because of concerns about the traffic pattern and long-term construction disruptions. This prompted New York Governor George Pataki to cancel the tunnel project in favor of a boulevard. The boulevard was finished by 2014.

In 2004, the police forces of both the PANYNJ and the NYPD announced concerns that the proposed One World Trade Center would be too close to the West Side Highway and thus vulnerable to car bombs. This prompted a total redesign of the tower and the relocation of its site away from the highway.

There used to be four West Street pedestrian bridges, two of them erected after the September 11 attacks. A below-grade crossing of the West Side Highway connecting Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center) complex and the Concourse level of the World Trade Center opened in October 2013, allowing the pedestrian bridge adjacent to Vesey Street to be removed.

On October 31, 2017, a man intentionally drove a pickup truck for a mile through the Hudson River Park&#x27;s bike path, parallel to the West Side Highway, between Houston Street and Chambers Street, killing eight people and injuring at least 11. In 2022, Manhattan borough president Mark Levine proposed converting one lane of the West Side Highway into a bike path due to heavy traffic on Hudson River Park&#x27;s bike lane.

==Major intersections==
Despite mostly being a boulevard, with many at-grade intersections and traffic lights, some of the intersections are given exit numbers.

<text>Chongwen District () is a former district of Beijing, located relatively southeast to the city center (Tiananmen), and was situated between Yongdingmen and Qianmen. It spanned an area of . It bordered Dongcheng to the north, Fengtai to the south, Chaoyang to the east, and Xuanwu to the west. It merged into the Dongcheng in July 2010.

Chongwen District was one of Beijing&#x27;s more compact districts, with its geographic area being considerably less than other districts. Prior to its merger with Dongcheng District, it was the smallest of the four districts that composed the city center. The district was renowned for the Temple of Heaven and Longtan Park, as well as housing the two original (and the most authentic) Peking Duck restaurants, Quanjude and Bianyifang.

<text>David George Foster OAM (born 20 March 1957) is an Australian world champion woodchopper, and Tasmanian community figure. He has held the World Woodchopping Championship title for 21 consecutive years, and is Australia&#x27;s most successful athlete and first and possibly the only athlete in any sport in the world to win over 1,000 titles.
==Athletic career==
He started woodchopping with his father, George Foster, in 1978, and between them they won the World 600 mm Double-handed Sawing Championship eleven years running. He and his brother Peter Foster continued competing and winning this event for another ten years, until 1999, making David a world champion 21 years running. They lost in 2000, but re-gained the championship in 2001, after which David&#x27;s son Stephen took over as his wood chopping partner.

His other achievements in wood chopping include winning the Australian Axeman of the Year award nine times in a row, winning every major wood chopping event in Australia and New Zealand, becoming the first person in sporting history to have won 1,000 championships and being the only axeman to have ever won six out of seven championships at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.

The Australian Axeman&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Latrobe, Tasmania, was operated by Foster and his wife Jan from 2004 until 2006.

Foster is often joined in his charitable quests by the Launceston cricketer David Boon. Both Foster and Boon, as well as then-Premier of Tasmania Jim Bacon, also willingly allowed their famous moustaches to be shaved off for charity.

Foster has written a book called &quot;The Power Of Two&quot;. He became a supporter of same sex marriage, following his daughter coming out to him.

==Honours==
Foster has received several awards for his cultural, charitable and community activities. These include being awarded an Order of Australia Medal, a commendation from the then Governor of Tasmania Sir Phillip Bennett and an Anzac Medal for services to the community. He also received a Tasmanian of the Year award in 1995, and was appointed a director of the National Australia Day Council in 1998. In 2020, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Foster is married to Jan Foster and has four children. Following his wife&#x27;s illness, he was forced to quit management of the Australian Axeman&#x27;s Hall of Fame at Latrobe. In 2014, he announced plans to leave Tasmania following an offer by [Camden Council (New South Wales)] to set up a multimillion-dollar tourist attraction focused on his memorabilia after Tasmanian businesses and government rejected proposals for a similar attraction in Tasmania. However, he remained in Tasmania after being signed as the spokesman for OneCare, a Tasmanian aged care provider.

<text>The Narváez expedition was a Spanish expedition started in 1527 that was intended to explore Florida and establish colonial settlements. The expedition was initially led by Pánfilo de Narváez, who died in 1528. Many more people died as the expedition traveled west along the unexplored Gulf Coast of the present-day United States and into the American southwest. Only four of the expedition&#x27;s original members survived, reaching Mexico City in 1536. These survivors were the first known non-Native Americans to see the Mississippi River, and to cross the Gulf of Mexico and Texas.

Narváez&#x27;s crew initially numbered about 600, including men from Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Italy. The expedition met with disaster almost immediately. Making stops at Hispaniola and Cuba on the way to La Florida, the fleet was devastated by a hurricane, among other storms, and lost two ships. They left Cuba in February 1528. Their intended destination was the Rio de las Palmas (near present-day Tampico, Mexico), with the purpose of founding two settlements. Storms, opposing currents, and strong winds forced them north to present-day Florida. After landing near Boca Ciega Bay, about 15 miles north of the entrance to Tampa Bay, Narváez and his pilots determined that their landing place was not suitable for settlement. Narváez ordered that the expedition be split, with 300 men sent overland northward along the coast and 100 men and ten women aboard the ships were also sent northward along the coast, as Narváez intended to reunify the land and seaborne expeditions at a supposed large harbor to the north of them that would be &quot;impossible to miss&quot;. The land expedition and the ships never met, as no large harbor existed north of their landing location. As it marched northward, the land expedition encountered numerous attacks by indigenous forces and suffered from disease and starvation. By September 1528, following an attempt by the survivors to sail on makeshift rafts from Florida to Mexico, only 80 men survived a storm and were swept onto Galveston Island off the coast of Texas. The stranded survivors were enslaved by indigenous nations, and more men continued to die from harsh conditions.

Only four of the original party—Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, and Dorantes&#x27; enslaved Moor Estevanico—made it to Mexico (the 5th known survivor was Juan Ortiz, who lived with Native Americans north of Tampa until de Soto arrived in 1538), during which they wandered through what is now the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They eventually encountered Spanish slave-catchers in Sinaloa in 1536, and with them, the four men finally reached Mexico City. Upon returning to Spain, Cabeza de Vaca wrote of the expedition in his &quot;La relación&quot; &quot;y comentarios&quot; (&quot;The Account and Commentaries&quot;), published in 1542 as the first written account of the indigenous peoples, wildlife, flora, and fauna of inland North America. It was published again by Cabeza de Vaca in 1555, this time to include descriptions of his subsequent experience as Governor of the Río de la Plata region in South America. A translation was later published under the title &quot;Naufragios&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks&quot;).

==Background==
On December 25, 1526, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor granted Pánfilo de Narváez a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States for the Kingdom of Spain. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, found at least two towns of one hundred people each, and garrison two additional forts anywhere along the coast. Narváez had to secure his own funding for the expedition. He recruited investors by marketing the promise of riches comparable to those recently discovered by Hernán Cortés in Mexico. He also called in many debts owed to him, and used this money to pay for major expenses of the expedition.

Appointed by the Spanish Crown as treasurer and sheriff, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was to serve as the king&#x27;s eyes and ears, and was second-in-command. He was to ensure the Crown received one fifth of any wealth acquired during the expedition. Other expedition members included Alonso de Solís as royal inspector of mines, Alonso Enríquez as comptroller, an Aztec prince called Don Pedro by the Spanish, and a contingent of Franciscan and diocesan priests led by Padre Juan Suárez (sometimes spelled Xuárez). Most of the expedition&#x27;s 600 men were soldiers, chiefly from Spain and Portugal, including some of mixed African descent, and some 22 from Italy.

== The expedition ==
On June 17, 1527, the expedition departed Spain from the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River. The total force included about 450 troops, officers, and slaves. About 150 others were sailors, wives (married men could not travel without their wives to the Indies), and servants.

The first stop on the voyage was the Canary Islands, about a week&#x27;s journey and 850 miles into the Atlantic. There the expedition resupplied such items as water, wine, firewood, meats, and fruit.

=== Hispaniola and Cuba ===
The explorers arrived in Santo Domingo (Hispaniola) sometime in August 1527. During the stay, troops began deserting. Although always a problem on such expeditions, the men may also have deserted because of hearing about the recent return of an expedition led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, in which 450 of 600 men perished. Nearly 100 men deserted the Narváez expedition in the first month in Santo Domingo. The expedition stopped here to purchase horses, as well as two small ships for exploring the coastline. Although Narváez was able to buy only one small ship, he set sail once again.

The expedition arrived in Santiago de Cuba in late September. As Cuba was the home of Narváez and his family, he had many contacts through whom he could collect more supplies, horses, and men. After meeting with his wealthy friend Vasco Porcallo, Narváez sent part of the fleet to Trinidad to collect horses and other supplies from his friend&#x27;s estate.

Narváez put Cabeza de Vaca and a captain named Pantoja in charge of two ships sent to Trinidad, while he took the other four ships to the Gulf of Guacanayabo. On about October 30, the two ships arrived in Trinidad to collect requisitioned supplies and seek additional crew. A hurricane arrived shortly after they did. During the storm, both ships sank, 60 men were killed, a fifth of the horses drowned, and all the new supplies acquired in Trinidad were destroyed.

Recognizing the need to regroup, Narváez sent the four remaining ships to Cienfuegos under the command of Cabeza de Vaca. Narváez stayed ashore in order to recruit men and purchase more ships. After nearly four months, on February 20, 1528, he arrived in Cienfuegos with one of two new ships and a few more recruits. The other ship he sent on to Havana. At this point, the expedition had about 400 men and 80 horses. The winter layover caused a depletion of supplies, and they planned to restock in Havana on the way to the Florida coast.

Among those hired by Narváez was a master pilot named Diego Miruelo, who claimed extensive knowledge of the Gulf Coast. Historians have debated for centuries his full identity and the extent of his knowledge. In any case, two days after leaving Cienfuegos, every ship in the fleet ran aground on the Canarreos shoals just off the coast of Cuba. They were stuck for two to three weeks, while the men depleted the already meager supplies. Not until the second week of March, when a storm created large seas, were they able to escape the shoals.

After battling more storms, the expedition rounded the western tip of Cuba and made its way toward Havana. Although they were close enough to see the masts of ships in port, the wind blew the fleet into the Gulf of Mexico without their reaching Havana. Narváez decided to press on with the journey and colonization plans. They spent the next month trying to reach the Mexican coast but could not overcome the Gulf Stream&#x27;s powerful current.

=== Arrival in Florida ===

On April 12, 1528, the expedition spotted land north of what is now Tampa Bay. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for what the pilot Miruelo described as a great harbor. During these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost. Finally, after spotting a shallow bay, Narváez ordered entry. They passed into Boca Ciega Bay north of the entrance to Tampa Bay. They spotted buildings set upon earthen mounds, encouraging signs of culture, food, and water. The natives have since been identified as members of the Safety Harbor culture. The Spaniards dropped anchors and prepared to go ashore. Narváez landed with 300 men in Boca Ciega Bay at what is known as the Jungle Prada Site in present-day St. Petersburg.

The comptroller Alonso Enríquez was one of the first ashore. Making his way to the nearby native village, he traded items such as glass beads, brass bells, and cloth for fresh fish and venison. Narváez ordered the rest of the company to debark and establish a camp.

The next day, the royal officials assembled ashore and, with ritual, performed the formal declaration of Narváez as royal governor of La Florida. He read (in Spanish) the &quot;Requerimiento&quot;, which stated to any natives listening that their land belonged to Charles V by order of the pope. He also said that natives had the choice of converting to Christianity. If they converted, they would be loved and welcomed with open arms; if they chose not to, war would be made against them. The expedition ignored both pleas and threats by a party of natives the next day.

After some exploring, Narváez and some other officers discovered Old Tampa Bay. They headed back to the camp and ordered Miruelo to pilot a brigantine in search of the great harbor he had talked about. If he was unsuccessful, he should return to Cuba. Narváez never regained contact with Miruelo or any of the crew of the brig.

Meanwhile, Narváez took another party inland, where they found another village, perhaps Tocobaga. The villagers were using Spanish freight boxes as coffins. The Spanish destroyed these and found a little food and gold. The locals told them that there was plenty of both in Apalachee to the north. After returning to their base camp, the Spanish made plans to head north.

=== Narváez splits forces ===
On May 1, 1528, Narváez made the decision to split the expedition into land and sea contingents. He planned to have an army of 300 march overland to the north while the ships, with the remaining 100 people, sailed up the coast to meet them. He believed the mouth to Tampa Bay to be a short distance to the north, when in fact it was to the south. Cabeza de Vaca argued against this plan, but was outvoted by the rest of the officers. Narváez wanted Cabeza de Vaca to lead the sea force, but he refused. He later wrote it was a matter of honor, as Narváez had implied he was a coward.

The men marched in near-starvation for two weeks before coming upon a village north of the Withlacoochee River. They enslaved the natives and for three days helped themselves to corn from their fields. They sent two exploratory parties downstream on both sides of the river looking for signs of the ships, but found none. Narváez ordered the party to continue north to Apalachee.

Years later, Cabeza de Vaca learned what had become of the ships. Miruelo had returned to Old Tampa Bay in the brigantine and found all the ships gone. He sailed to Havana to pick up the fifth ship, which had been supplied, and brought it back to Tampa Bay. After heading north for some time without finding the party on land, commanders of the other three ships decided to return to Tampa Bay. After meeting, the fleet again searched for the land party for nearly a year before finally departing for Mexico. Juan Ortiz, a member of the naval force, was captured by the Uzita. He later escaped to Mocoso, where he lived until rescued by Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition.

=== Meeting the Timucua ===
From scout reports, the Timucua knew the Spanish party was nearing their territory. They decided to meet the Europeans as they came near on June 18. Through hand signs and gestures, Narváez communicated to their chief, Dulchanchellin, that they were headed to Apalachee. Dulchanchellin appeared pleased by this (it turned out the Apalachee were his enemies).

After the two leaders exchanged gifts, the expedition followed the Timucua into their territory and crossed the Suwannee River. During the crossing, an officer named Juan Velázquez charged into it on his horse, and both drowned. His was the first non-shipwreck casualty of the expedition, and the men were disturbed by his death. The starving army cooked and ate his horse that night.

When the Spaniards arrived at the Timucua village on June 19, the chief sent them provisions of maize. That night, an arrow was shot past one of Narváez&#x27;s men near a watering hole. The next morning, the Spaniards found the natives had deserted the village. They set out again for Apalachee. They soon realized they were being accompanied by hostile natives. Narváez laid a trap for the pursuing natives, and they captured three or four, whom they used as guides. The Spanish had no further contact with those Timucua.

=== Apalachee ===
On June 25, 1528, the expedition entered Apalachee territory. Finding a community of forty houses, they thought it was the capital, but it was a small outlying village of a much larger culture. The Spanish attacked, took several hostages including the village&#x27;s &quot;cacique&quot;, and occupied the village. Although the villagers had none of the gold and riches Narváez was expecting, they did have much maize.

Soon after Narváez took the village, Apalachee warriors began attacking the Europeans. Their first attack was a force of 200 warriors, who used burning arrows to set fire to the houses the Europeans occupied. The warriors quickly dispersed, losing only one man. The next day a second force of 200 warriors, equipped with large bows, attacked from the opposite side of the village. This force also quickly dispersed and lost only one man.

After these direct attacks, the Apalachee changed to quick assaults after the Spanish started trekking again. They could fire their bows five or six times while the Spanish loaded a crossbow or harquebus, then fade away into the woods. They harassed the Spanish with guerrilla tactics continuously for the next three weeks. During this time, Narváez sent out three scouting missions in search of larger or wealthier towns. All three came back without good news. Frustrated by misfortune and failing health, Narváez ordered the expedition to head south. The Apalachee and Timucua captives told him that the people of Aute had a great deal of food, and their village was near the sea. The party had to cross a large swamp to reach the place.

For the first two days out of the village, the Spaniards were not attacked, but once they were up to their chests in water in the swamp, the Apalachee attacked them with a shower of arrows. Nearly helpless, the Spanish could neither use their horses nor quickly reload their heavy weapons, and they found their armor weighing them down in water. After regaining solid ground, they drove off the attackers. For the next two weeks, they made their difficult way through the swamp, occasionally under attack by the Apalachee.

When the Spanish finally reached Aute, they found the village already deserted and burnt. They harvested enough corn, beans, and squash from the garden to feed their party, many of whom were starving, wounded and sick. After two days, Narváez sent Cabeza de Vaca to look for an opening to the sea. He did not find the sea, but after half a day&#x27;s march along the Wakulla River and St. Marks River, he found shallow, salty water filled with oyster beds. Two more days of scouting produced no better results, and the men returned to tell Narváez the news.

Narváez decided to go to the oyster beds for the food. With many of the horses carrying the sick and wounded, the Spanish realized they were struggling for survival. Some considered cannibalism to survive. During the march, some of the &quot;caballeros&quot; talked about stealing their horses and abandoning everyone else. Although Narváez was too ill to take action, Cabeza de Vaca learned of the plan and convinced them to stay.

After a few days stuck near the shallow waters, one man came up with a plan: he suggested reforging their weaponry and armor to make tools and to build new boats to sail to Mexico. The party agreed and started action on August 4, 1528.

They constructed a forge out of a log and used deerskins for the bellows. They cut down trees and made charcoal for the forge. Then they made hammers, saws, axes, and nails out of their iron gear. Caulking was made from the pitch of pine trees, and palmetto leaves were used as oakum. They sewed shirts together for sails. Occasionally they raided the Aute village, from which they stole 640 bushels of corn to sustain themselves during the construction. Twice, within sight of the camp, ten men gathering shellfish were killed by Apalachee raids.

The men killed their horses for food and material while they were building the boats – one horse every three days. They used horsehair to braid rope and the skins for water storage bags. As horses were highly valued by the Spanish, especially the nobility, they named the bay, now known as Apalachee Bay, &quot;Bahia de los Caballos&quot; in honor of the sacrifice of the animals.

By September 20, they had finished building five boats. They sailed on September 22, 1528. After being ravaged by disease, starvation, and attacks by the various peoples they intended to conquer, 242 men had survived. About 50 men were carried by each boat, which were thirty to forty feet long and had a shallow draft, sail, and oars.

=== South Texas ===

Closely following the Gulf Coast, the boats proceeded to the west, but frequent storms, thirst and starvation reduced the expedition to about 80 survivors before a hurricane cast Cabeza de Vaca and his remaining men on the western shore of a barrier island. There they suffered hunger and disease, causing them to name the island the &quot;island of misfortune,&quot; &quot;island of doom,&quot; or &quot;island of ill fortune&quot; (variously translated). Historians believe they landed at present-day Galveston, Texas. However, other historians have pointed out that there are several inconsistencies between Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s description of the island and Galveston Island. As a result, many historians believe that it is more likely that Cabeza de Vaca and his companions actually landed at what is now Follet&#x27;s Island, immediately southwest of Galveston Island. Narváez is believed to have been swept out to sea during a storm.

For the next four years, Cabeza de Vaca and a steadily dwindling number of his comrades lived in the complex indigenous world of South Texas, where tribes of different cultures and languages often lived in conflict with one another. Cabeza de Vaca wrote detailed anthropological notes on the customs and culture of the people he met, including a few tribes that have been tentatively identified by modern researchers, such as the Karankawa people along the Gulf Coast and the Tonkawa in central Texas. Most tribe names in the Relación, however, are not attested by any other written source and difficult to link to any tribes mentioned elsewhere.

=== Southwestern North America ===

By 1532, only four members of the original expedition survived: Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and Estevanico, an enslaved Moor. They headed west and gradually south hoping to reach the Spanish Empire&#x27;s outpost in Mexico, becoming the first men of Europe and Africa to enter Southwestern North America (present day Southwestern United States and Northwest Mexico). Their precise route has been difficult for historians to determine, but they apparently traveled across present-day Texas, perhaps into New Mexico and Arizona, and through Mexico&#x27;s northern provinces near the Pacific Coast before turning inland.
In July 1536, near Culiacán in present-day Sinaloa, the survivors encountered fellow Spaniards on a slave-taking expedition for New Spain. As Cabeza de Vaca wrote later, his countrymen were &quot;dumbfounded at the sight of me, strangely dressed and in the company of Indians. They just stood staring for a long time.&quot; The Spaniards accompanied the survivors to Mexico City. Estevanico later served as a guide for other expeditions. Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain, where he wrote a full account, especially describing the many indigenous peoples they encountered. He later served the colonial government in South America.

== Representation in other media ==
&quot;The Moor&#x27;s Account&quot;, a 2014 novel by Laila Lalami, is a fictional memoir of Estebanico, the Moroccan slave who accompanied Cabeza de Vaca as one of the four survivors of the expedition. He is known as the first black explorer of America. Lalami explains that nothing is known about him except for one line in Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s chronicle: &quot;The fourth [survivor] is Estevanico, an Arab Negro from Azamor.&quot; It was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in fiction. &quot;A Land So Strange&quot;, a 2007 historical narrative by Andrés Reséndez, retells the journey for a modern audience using primary sources by Cabeza de Vaca and the official report. &quot;Esteban: The African Slave Who Explored America&quot;, a 2018 nonfiction biography by Dennis Herrick, dispels centuries of myths and inaccuracies about the African. &quot;The Gentle Conquistadors&quot;, a 1971 children&#x27;s novel by Jeannette Mirsky and Thomas Morley, gives a somewhat fictionalized account of the expedition.

<text>Cex is an American musical project run by Rjyan Claybrook Kidwell and started in 1998 at the age of 16. Although Cex and Kidwell are frequently used interchangeably, Cex occasionally expands to several people at sporadic points, such as particular tours or albums. In the past it has included Kidwell&#x27;s musical associates, friends, touring partners, or high school bandmates.

==History==
The first Cex album, &quot;Cells&quot;, was a compilation of tracks Kidwell had been working on for several years, and was released in 1998 by his own CD-R label, _underscore, while he was still at Dulaney High School in Timonium, Maryland. The following year, Kidwell met Miguel Depedro (Kid 606) and the two founded Tigerbeat6, a record label which would be among the vanguards of the electronica movement at the time. The next Cex album, &quot;Role Model&quot;, was one of the label&#x27;s first releases (2000), and was quickly followed up the next year with &quot;Oops, I Did It Again!&quot;. &quot;Oops&quot; not only took its title from the Britney Spears album of the same name, but played around with the title by depicting photos of the aftermath of a murder on the cover art.

All of the Cex releases up to this time were classified as IDM (Intelligent dance music) and had very little vocals or lyrics for the most part. However, Kidwell was not content to stay behind the laptop while on tour, and quickly and openly aspired to become &quot;#1 Entertainer&quot;. He started to hone freestyling skills and performing new songs with vocal tracks like &quot;who&#x27;s the man with no clothes, underwear, fur coat, chilling in the alley?/I&#x27;m the man with no clothes, underwear, fur coat/he&#x27;s brandishing knives!&quot; (&quot;Fur Coat&quot;) and &quot;I know you&#x27;re stressed/&#x27;cause there&#x27;s only one Cex/and your girlfriend&#x27;s pissed/&#x27;cause you ain&#x27;t him&quot; (&quot;One Cex&quot;). His vocal style was very confrontational and nearly atonal, and contained typically outrageous braggadocio; he frequently would go out of his way to chat to his audience between or in the middle of songs, and was known to strip down to his underwear (or less) from time to time. In 2002, he was offered a coveted tour spot opening for the East Coast leg of the &quot;Death and Dismemberment&quot; tour with Death Cab for Cutie and old friends from Washington, DC The Dismemberment Plan. Also in 2002 he collaborated with Aaron Funk; a Winnipeg electronic artist known as Venetian Snares to create &quot;stamina&quot; the ninth track on Aaron&#x27;s &#x27;02 album &quot;237 0894&quot;. Later that year, &quot;Tall, Dark, and Handcuffed&quot;, his first album with full vocals, was released. He continued to open for noted bands such as Super Furry Animals and The Roots, as well as musical friends Grand Buffet.

2003 was a pivotal year for Kidwell - after spending his entire life living in or around Baltimore, he packed up and drove out to Oakland, California. Car malfunctions and a week stranded in the western US became the inspiration for his second album of that year, &quot;Maryland Mansions&quot;. In April, he gained further exposure opening for indie darlings The Postal Service. Before this, however, he released &quot;Being Ridden&quot; in both vocal and instrumental form. The album cover paid homage to David Bowie, imitating the cover for &quot;Heroes&quot;. Also notably, the album was not released by Tigerbeat6, and it seemed to have largely abandoned both the IDM and jokey old-school hip-hop of &quot;Tall, Dark, and Handcuffed&quot; for rawer sounds and themes. &quot;Maryland Mansions&quot; pushed those motifs further and was modelled somewhat on the Nine Inch Nails EP &quot;Broken&quot;, and was released just around the time that Kidwell returned to Baltimore. Two music videos for &quot;Maryland Mansions&quot; were released early in 2004, and Kidwell moved again, to Chicago a few months later.

Shortly thereafter, he married Roby Newton (from the band Milemarker), and reorganized Cex as a three-piece: Kidwell, Newton, and Cale Parks (from the bands Joan of Arc and Aloha). This configuration released an EP, &quot;Know Doubt&quot;, in 2005 on a Chicago label called Record Label. This trio, joined by Portland, OR duo Nice Nice and ex-Dismemberment Plan guitarist Jason Caddell, was featured on the next Cex album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Actual Fucking&quot;, made up of tracks named after and written about various American cities (Baltimore, Los Angeles, Denton, etc.). The album is heavy on vocals and was released by Seattle label Automation Records.

In 2007 Kidwell would go on to release an EP entitled &quot;Exotical Privates&quot;, which involved two different cover images for both CD and an LP. The LP cover was in response to AFI&#x27;s newly formed electronic project, Blaqk Audio, whose album was named the same as Kidwell&#x27;s first record, &quot;CexCells&quot;. The cover features an AFI tattoo on a scrotum. The EP&#x27;s musical material is made up of a combination of samples from Actual Fucking and Kate Bush. It was released on Automation Records.

Kidwell is said to be working on a newly formed side project by the name of Sandcats as well, described as being &quot;a solo project for two people&quot;, his wife and himself. They moved back to Baltimore in 2005.

Kidwell would later work in theater. Kidwell made his acting debut in an adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;Ubik&quot; in 2012. Kidwell predominantly spent 2013 working in theater productions and DJing at clubs in Baltimore. He performed new music as Cex in 2014 that was described as a &quot;dramatic change in direction&quot;.

<text>The musimon (also known as the tityrus or tytron) is a charge in European heraldry. It is a cross between a goat and a sheep; it has the feet and body of a goat, the head and beard of a ram, and two horns from each for a total of four—two curved and two straight.

Musimon can also refer to the real animal known as the European mouflon (&quot;Ovis aries musimon&quot;), a wild short-fleeced mountain sheep found on the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and parts of mainland Europe.

<text>Allegheny City was a municipality that existed in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania from 1788 until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. It was located north across the Allegheny River from downtown Pittsburgh, with its southwest border formed by the Ohio River, and is known today as the North Side. The city&#x27;s waterfront district, along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, became Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Shore neighborhood.

The area of Allegheny City included the present Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Allegheny Center, Allegheny West, Brighton Heights, California-Kirkbride, Central Northside, Chateau, East Allegheny, Fineview, Manchester, Marshall-Shadeland, North Shore, Perry South, Spring Hill–City View, and Troy Hill; most of Perry North; and parts of Northview Heights and Spring Garden.
== History ==

Allegheny was laid out in 1788 according to a plan by John Redick. The lots were sold in Philadelphia by Pennsylvania&#x27;s state government or given as payment to Revolutionary War veterans. It was incorporated as a borough in 1828 and as a city in 1840. Prior to the 1850s, most of the area was still largely farmland, but was subdivided into residential lots, first for the growing German population and later for Croat immigrants. It was commonly referred to as &quot;Deutschtown&quot;, derived from the German word &quot;Deutsch&quot;, referring to the language and ethnicity.

Allegheny annexed adjoining municipalities such as the boroughs of Manchester, Spring Garden and Duquesne, and the areas that became Brighton Heights, Observatory Hill, Perry Hilltop, Summer Hill, Spring Hill and Troy Hill.

The annexation of Allegheny by Pittsburgh began with voting in favor of a &quot;Greater Pittsburg&quot; in a special election held on June 12, 1906 and was effected on December 9, 1907, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision &quot;Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh&quot; handed down on November 19 that year.
It was approved by the federal government in 1911. The annexation was controversial at the time, as an overwhelming majority of Allegheny City residents were opposed to the merger. Previous Pennsylvania law had directed that a majority of the voters in each merging municipality had to approve an annexation agreement. In 1906, the State Assembly passed a new law that authorized annexations if a majority of the total voters in both combined municipalities approved the merger. The annexation was rejected by the residents of Allegheny City by a 2:1 margin, but was approved by much more populous Pittsburgh residents, and the annexation bill passed into law. Allegheny City residents tried unsuccessfully for years to have the annexation overturned in court.

The population of Pittsburgh rose from 321,616 in 1900 to 533,905 in 1910, which included the 132,283 who lived in Allegheny in 1910, when the last separate census of Allegheny was taken.

When the two cities were joined, both of the old ward systems were discarded. A new ward system was established made up of 27 wards. In the new ward system, Allegheny was divided into wards 21 to 27. Its past territory is easily seen by viewing a map of the city wards.

In the 1960s, Pittsburgh undertook a massive urban redevelopment project that demolished the historic core of Allegheny City, leaving only the Commons of Allegheny Center and its surrounding neighborhoods. The Carnegie Library, the Old Post Office Building, and the Buhl Planetarium buildings were not demolished. Major portions of the neighborhoods of Allegheny West, Manchester, Central Northside, California-Kirkbride (Old Allegheny Rows), and East Allegheny are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Mexican War Streets in Central Northside.

== Industry ==

Allegheny was an industrial city and had numerous commercial areas, churches, and social organizations, packing houses, tanneries, soap factories and glue factories that provided opportunities for employment to the primarily German immigrants who settled there. The H.J. Heinz Company built its factory in Allegheny City, close to the Chestnut Street bridge (this has been replaced by the 16th Street Bridge). Heyl &amp; Patterson Inc., a manufacturer of railcar dumpers and ship unloaders, also established a factory in Allegheny City. The surviving structures are now occupied by a furniture warehouse and a bus garage.

By the middle of the 19th century, the &quot;Made in Allegheny&quot; label could be found not only on basic iron but on rope, plows, cotton cloth, wool, food, paper, paint, steam engines, wagons and carts, meat, soap, candles, lumber, linseed oil, furniture and a host of other diversified products. Railroad lines were built along the north side of the Allegheny for the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad railroads in Allegheny. When workers in Pittsburgh struck against the Pennsylvania Railroad after wage cuts in July 1877, railroad workers on these lines also went on strike.

== Historic places ==

===Teutonia Männerchor===
The Teutonia Männerchor Hall in the East Allegheny (Deutschtown) neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a building constructed in 1888. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Teutonia Männerchor is a private membership club with the purpose of furthering choral singing, German cultural traditions and good fellowship. The club features a number of heritage activities and celebrations, including choral singing in German and folk dancing.

===The Priory===
The Priory is the name for two historic landmarks – the 1852 St. Mary&#x27;s German Catholic Church and the adjacent 1888 home for Bavarian Benedictine priests and brothers. Once a largely German parish, the church later merged with nearby Italian and Polish congregations. The church and rectory have since closed. The buildings are operated as a banquet hall and a bed-and-breakfast.

===Penn Brewery===
Although Penn Brewery began in 1987, it is housed in the old Eberhardt &amp; Ober Brewery (1882–1906) buildings. Penn Brewery makes the award-winning Penn Pilsner and a number of other specialty beers. The &quot;tied house&quot; (brewery owned restaurant) features a full German menu and live music.

===Saint Nicholas Church===
Saint Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church, nestled in the hillside above the Allegheny River, was the first Croatian Church built in the United States. The structure was razed in January 2013.

===Ridge Avenue Neighborhood===
Ridge Avenue, in its heyday between 1890 and 1910, was known as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;. After 20 years, the area began to decline as some residents moved further out. The entire North Side community began to fray after having been annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907.

===Mexican War Streets===
In the late 19th century, Allegheny became known for its stately homes, occupied by some of the area&#x27;s wealthy families. One such area became known as The Mexican War Streets.

The Mexican War Streets were laid out in 1847 by William Robinson Jr., who had earlier been mayor of the city of Allegheny. Robinson, who contrary to some popular tellings did not actually serve in the Mexican War, subdivided his land and named the new streets after the battles and generals (Buena Vista Street, Filson Way, Monterey Street, Palo Alto Street, Resaca Place, Sherman Avenue, Taylor Avenue) of that war.

===Carnegie Free Public Libraries===
Through his foundation matching fund, Andrew Carnegie contributed to the financing and construction of the Carnegie Free Library of Allegheny in Allegheny City.

St. Anthony Chapel

Built on Troy Hill between 1880 &amp; 1892 by Father Suitbert Mollinger, the chapel houses the largest collection of religious relics outside of the Vatican and features life sized Stations of the Cross statues.

===Ballparks===
Allegheny was the location of Exposition Park and Recreation Park, which were the earliest home fields of the Pittsburgh Pirates professional baseball team (founded as the Allegheny Base Ball Club). On the North Side of Pittsburgh today are PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Acrisure Stadium (formerly Heinz Field), home of the Pittsburgh Steelers. These facilities replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which was the shared home of both teams.

===Felix Brunot Mansion===
The Felix Brunot mansion on Stockton Avenue was once used as a station on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves from the South stopped here for food and shelter. While Pennsylvania was a free state, many slaves continued to Canada to gain more distance from slavecatchers.

===Allegheny Observatory===
The original Allegheny Observatory was built in 1859 near Perrysville Avenue, by prominent Allegheny citizens who formed the Allegheny Telescope Association. The association donated the observatory to the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) in 1867, after which it was used for astrophysical, solar, and planetary studies. The observatory maintained a successful subscription time service to railroads via telegraph for many years. A new Allegheny Observatory was built between 1900 and 1912 in today&#x27;s Riverview Park. It is owned and operated by the University of Pittsburgh for education, astronomical research, and public lectures and tours.

<text>The Aero A.100 was a biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft built in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was the final step in a design lineage that extended back to the Aero A.11 a decade earlier. A.100s remained in service throughout World War II and for a few years postwar.
==Design and development==
Development of the A.100 was in response to a Czechoslovak Air Force requirement of 1932 for a uniform replacement for the A.11s, Aero Ap.32s, and Letov Š.16s then in service. Work began with a revision of the Aero A.430 that quickly became quite a different aircraft. Of standard biplane configuration, the A.100 was a somewhat ungainly-looking aircraft which was obsolescent by the time of its first flight in 1933, becoming a member of the final generation of biplane military aircraft to be designed in Europe.

==Operational history==
Nevertheless, since the only other competitor for the air force contract, the Praga E.36, had not flown by the close of tenders, the A.100 was ordered for production. A total of 44 were built, in two batches.

==Further development==
The Aero A.100 was later developed into Aero A.101 with Praga Isotta Fraschini Asso 1000 RV engine (800 h.p.), first flying in December 1934, this type served in the Spanish Civil War curiously on both sides of the conflict. Further development led to Aero Ab.101 (enlarged hull and wings plus Avia Hispano Suiza HS 12 Ydrs engine rated 860 h.p.) produced from 1936 to 1937 and serving in the Czechoslovak Air Force up to its dissolution in March 1939. Final stage of the development was Aero A.104, where Ab.101 was converted to a high-wing monoplane with enclosed cockpit, only one prototype was built in 1937.

<text>Brush Traction was a manufacturer and maintainer of railway locomotives in Loughborough, England whose operations have now been merged into the Wabtec company&#x27;s Doncaster UK operations.

==History==

===Hughes&#x27;s Locomotive &amp; Tramway Engine Works===
Henry Hughes had been operating at the Falcon Works since the 1850s, producing items such as brass and iron cast parts for portable engines and thrashing machines. In 1860 Henry Hughes announced he had entered into a partnership with William March who had extensive experience in the timber trade, and this would be added to the existing business of &quot;engineers and manufacturers of railway plant&quot;, with the business to be called Hughes and March.

In March 1863, Hughes announced it was making a steam locomotive designed for contractors and mineral railways. This was an with a 200 psi boiler pressure and cylinders of 10 inch bore and 15 inch stroke.

In 1866, Hughes announced a sale of timber and associated equipment from the &quot;Falcon Railway Plant Works&quot; as he had decided to close down the timber side of his business, also sold was a portable steam engine and thrashing engine.

In 1877, a limited company (Hughes&#x27;s Locomotive &amp; Tramway Engine Works Ltd) was created with Henry Hughes as managing director, to carry on the business previously under the name of the &quot;Falcon Railway Plant Works&quot;. The business included the production of the original small saddle tank locomotives, but was anticipating increased demand for the production of tram engines, lightweight steam engines (usually with condensers) which drew passenger cars, made possible by the Tramways Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 78). His original patented tramway engine was reported to have been tested on the Vale of Clyde and other tramways with good results. Tram engines were distinct from those tramcars where the boiler mechanism was an integral part of the passenger car.

Examples of early engines include the tramway locomotive &quot;The Pioneer&quot; of 1877 for the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, &quot;Belmont&quot; which ran on the Snailbeach District Railways, and three gauge s for the Corris Railway supplied in 1878 (converted between 1883 and 1900 to s).

In 1881, Hughes&#x27; built two gauge for the Liverpool Corporation Waterworks Committee for use in the construction of the waterworks at Lake Vyrnwy in Wales.

The adoption of steam tram engines in the UK was very limited, though the company did make some sales abroad, for example in Paris and Lille. In February 1881, a shareholder and creditor asked that the voluntary winding up of the company should proceed under the supervision of the court, and an order was granted. Hughes departed, soon after, for New Zealand, where in collaboration with local engineer E.W Mills, he built small tramway engines.

===Falcon Engine &amp; Car Works===
Hughes&#x27;s Locomotive &amp; Tramway Engine Works was sold as a going concern, and continued production as the Falcon Engine and Car Works Ltd. In July 1882, they provided a tram engine (Falcon works number 43) for testing on the Burnley tramways, which during a late night trial suffered a condenser rupture scalding several people. This was just days after a serious fire at the works had caused considerable losses - fortunately the premises were insured.

Business continued with the production of locomotives, carriages, wagons and tramcars. This included three more locomotives of the same design as previously for the railways at Vyrnwy. In 1883, the first tramcar on the Alford and Sutton Tramway, was a horse-drawn 16-seater made by Falcon Engine and Carriage Works.

One of the less conventional products were the carriages and wagons for the Listowel to Ballybunion monorail (using the Lartigue Monorail system), which opened in 1888. The engines for this line were made by Hunslet.

Other products were tank locomotives for Ireland, Spain and the Azores. Some were subcontracts from other firms, such as Kerr, Stuart and Company, at that time, in Glasgow.

===Brush Electrical Engineering Company===

In 1889, the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation Ltd was reconstructed, absorbing the Australasian Electric Light, Power, and Storage Company Ltd, and taking over the Falcon Works in Loughborough, with the new company to be called the Brush Electrical Engineering Company Ltd.


From reports of the annual general meetings, the main activities in the 1890s were associated with municipal and ships lighting, however it is evident they were still involved with rail and tramcars and were anticipating a great increase in the market for electric traction particularly on tramways. They expanded the works by 5 acres in 1897 and added another 250 tramcars per year of production capacity. In 1898, they added capacity to make 1,000 electric traction motors per year, their own motors now claimed to be equal to or superior to the American pattern traction motors previously used.

The first Brush motorcar was launched in March 1902. It was powered by a 10 hp 2 cylinder Abeille engine, with a Sage 3 speed gearbox and double chain drive. It was joined later the same year by larger 4 cylinder Brush cars of 12, 16 and 20 hp, which also used Abeille engines and chain drive. The single-cylinder 6 hp &quot;Brushmobile&quot; car was produced only in 1904, six being constructed by Brush under licence from Vauxhall Motors; the Brush vehicles differed from the original 6 hp Vauxhalls by having steering wheels rather than tiller steering. One of these six vehicles featured in the 1966 film &quot;Carry On Screaming&quot;. In addition, nearly 100 buses, plus some lorries were built using French engines until 1907.

Brush Electrical Engineering also built some carriages that were used on the Central London Railway and the City and South London Railway in the early 1900s, the respective forerunners of London Underground&#x27;s Central and Northern lines.

In all, about 250 steam locomotives were built in addition to their tram engines. Production finished after World War I and the company concentrated on transport-related electrical equipment, including tramcars, trolleybuses and battery-operated vehicles.

Brush made 2-foot gauge battery electric narrow-gauge locomotives (at the time referred to as Brush Electric Tractors) during the war, three which were listed as surplus in October 1919. Several examples survive, one at the National Slate Museum, Llanberis, three of them went to Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry, of which two of these remain. These were reported to have originally worked at the Avonmouth mustard gas factory. One from HM&#x27;s Explosives Factory at Queensferry has been restored using parts from another from the same factory.

During World War II, Brush Coachworks diversified into aircraft production, building 335 de Havilland Dominies for the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. Wing sections were built for Lancaster bombers and Hampden fuselages were overhauled.

The coachworks continued after the war with omnibus bodies mounted on Daimler chassis using Gardner five-cylinder diesel engines and Daimler preselector gearboxes, as well as AEC and BMMO Chassis for Midland Red and 100 Leyland Titans for Birmingham City Transport. They also constructed bodies designed by the British Electric Traction group on Leyland Royal Tigers. In 1952, the coachworks were closed and the goodwill and patents were bought by neighbouring Willowbrook.

===Brush Bagnall Traction===
Close to Derby and its railway workshops, it retained its contacts with the railway. Acquired by Heenan &amp; Froude in 1947, it was merged with W. G. Bagnall to produce diesel locomotives. In 1951, the company Brush Bagnall Traction Limited was formed. When British Railways began to replace its fleet of steam engines, Brush entered the market for main line diesel-electric locomotives.

===Brush Traction===
In 1957, the Brush group were bought up by Hawker Siddeley. In 1967, the rail tractor business of Crompton Parkinson was purchased. As part of Hawker Siddeley Electric Power Group, it then passed to BTR plc and became Brush Traction. Later it became part of FKI Energy Technologies, itself purchased in 2008 by Melrose Industries.

In 2007, Brush Traction acquired Hunslet-Barclay with a facility in Kilmarnock. It was rebranded Brush-Barclay.

In February 2011, Wabtec purchased Brush Traction for US$31 million.

The locomotive works are still occupied by the Brush Traction Company and are in use for the building, overhaul and repair of locomotives.

In April 2021, Wabtec announced the Loughborough factory would close with reduced work volumes making the site unsustainable.

==Locomotives==


Brush manufactured various diesel and electric locomotives for the British railway network:
*Class 31 &quot;Brush Type 2&quot; mixed-traffic diesel locomotive
*Class 47 &quot;Brush Type 4&quot; mixed-traffic diesel locomotive (manufacture shared with Crewe Works)
*Class 48 &quot;Brush Type 4&quot; mixed-traffic diesel locomotive
*Class 53 &quot;Falcon&quot; prototype diesel locomotive
*HS4000 &quot;Kestrel&quot;
*Class 57 re-engineered diesel locomotive (rebuilt from Class 47)
*Class 60 heavy freight diesel locomotive
*Class 92 dual-voltage electric locomotive
It also manufactured the Eurotunnel Class 9 electric locomotives operated by Eurotunnel through the Channel Tunnel.

Brush Traction also manufactured locomotives for export:
*800 bhp A1A-A1A main line diesel-electric locomotives for Ceylon in 1952 (Sri Lanka Railways M1)
*1,000 bhp Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotives for Sri Lanka in 1981 (the M7 class)
*Class DE4 1730 bhp Co-Co narrow gauge diesel-electric locomotives for Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1963
*Various Bo-Bo diesel electric freight locomotives to Cuba, Tanzania, Gabon, Morocco
*Battery electric locomotives to Hong Kong
*EF class heavy freight electric locomotive (New Zealand Railways Corporation)
*Class 18 shunter locomotives for Malayan Railways in 1978

They were also a major supplier of traction equipment to rapid transit systems, in particular, London Underground and Docklands Light Railway in the UK, and to Canada and Taiwan.

Traction equipment was supplied to British Rail for various Electric Multiple Unit trains, the Class 43 HST diesel locomotive, with similar equipment being supplied to Comeng in Australia in 1979, and used in the Class 56 and 58 freight locomotives.

Brush repowered most Class 43 HST power cars with MTU engines between 2005 and 2010.

*Auckland Electric Tramways Company, No. 11 (1902) – double-bogie (Brush D1) saloon tram. Restored
*Auckland Electric Tramways Company, No. 17 (1902) – double-bogie (Brush D1) double-decker tram. Unrestored.
*Auckland Electric Tramways Company, No. 24 / No. 26 (1902) – Privately preserved box cars bodies only, which originally resided on a Brush four-wheel trucks. Unrestored.
*Auckland Electric Tramways Company, No. 44 – (1906) AETCL built box car body which originally resided on a Brush four-wheel truck. Retired 1931. Restored 2006 using a former Brussels 21E truck. Restored.
*Preserved Auckland trams 89 and 91 originally fitted with Brush D1 trucks with Brush 1200 motors and 147 fitted with Brush Improved trucks and 203 refitted with the same.
*Auckland Brush truck remnants. In 2012, excavations at the former Mount Roskill Bus Depot circa 1951 for a new shopping centre uncovered over a dozen Brush D side frames along with a single Brush improved side frame and remnants of Brush 1200 and Brush 1400 Motor cases. The side frames are now in MOTAT&#x27;s possession for research and future Auckland tram restorations with the motor remnants being cared for in private hands for possible replication for various projects. It is believed to be the only Brush 1200 and 1400 motors to have survived in New Zealand if not the world.
*Component drawings for Brush H2 and Brush H4 Controllers exist in the archives of the Auckland Electric Tramways Trust with a view to producing replicas.
*Brush four-wheel truck – a copy of a 21e Brill. built for the Napier Tramways, New Zealand. Tram number unknown. Tram bodies sold off 1931 after the Napier earthquake. The truck used subsequently as the running gear for a Saw Mill railway shunter at the Robert Holt and Sons&#x27; sawmill. Does not have traction motors.
Preserved in the United Kingdom:
*Chesterfield No. 7 (1904) – Preserved at the National Tramway Museum, Derbyshire. It was used as a holiday cottage from 1927 until 1973, when it was purchased for preservation. It was restored between 1993 and 1996 at a cost of £120,000, and has been operational since 1997.
*Derby Corporation Tramways No. 1 (1904) – Preserved by the National Tramway Museum, Derbyshire, as a static exhibit. It was used as a holiday cottage from 1933 to 1962, and was restored between then and 1970. It was re-gauged from to standard gauge during the restoration, and was put on public display as a non-operational exhibit in 1991. In 2021 it was in off-site storage. 
*Blackpool Tramways No. 298/635 (1937) – Owned by National Tramway Museum, it was on public display from 2005 to 2014.

==Battery-electric vehicles==

In 1940, Brush required some small battery-electric tractor units, but as none were commercially available, they asked AC Morrison of AE Morrison and Sons (later Morrison-Electricar) to produce a design for one. Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. Subsequently, they began selling them on the open market and shipped a large order to Russia in 1941. They added battery electric road vehicles to their product list in 1945, buying the designs and manufacturing rights from Metropolitan-Vickers, so that early Brush vehicles are almost indistinguishable from late Metro-Vicks. 3-wheeled vehicles were marketed as the Brush Pony, and they also produced 4-wheeled vehicles. In 1948 they added a 2-ton chassis to their range, which could be supplied with a large van, standard van, flat truck or milk float body. The welded box-section chassis was fitted with semi-elliptic springs and a Lockheed hydraulic braking system. The 36-cell 290 Ahr battery was mounted on both sides of the central spine. The electric motor was connected to a banjo-type rear axle by a Layrub propeller shaft. In common with other Brush vehicles, control was by a double-depression foot pedal, where the first depression gave two stages of control with the two-halves of the battery connected in parallel, and the second depression gave a further two stages with the batteries in series.

In early 1949, they reduced the prices of their electric vehicles by around 25 per cent, in an attempt to make them more competitive with petrol vehicles. The models affected were the 10-14 cwt chassis and the 18-22 cwt chassis, and they were hoping to see a five-fold increase in sales. Sales of their industrial electric truck had trebled between 1947 and 1948. All of their road vehicles were sold through the motor trade, in order to achieve a good standard of after-sales service.

In 1949, they offered 25 standard bodies for their chassis, including a mobile canteen or ice cream parlour, which they exhibited at the Dairy Show that year. The vehicle had a top speed of 16 mph, and a range of 28 miles, based on eight stops per mile. Production of 4-wheeled battery electrics ceased in 1950, although the company continued to manufacture the 3-wheeled Brush Pony milk float and their range of industrial trucks. They maintained enough spare parts to allow them to service 4-wheeled vehicles for a further 10 years and sold the remainder to Hindle, Smart and Co of Manchester, who made Helecs milk floats.

In 1972, Hawker Siddeley bought a 50 per cent share in Crompton Leyland Electricars Ltd (CLE), from British Leyland. CLE was the manufacturer of Morrison-Electricar milk floats, and at this point Hawker Siddeley owned Brush, RA Lister &amp; Company, based in Dursley and Brook Victor Electric Vehicles based in Huddersfield, all of which were producing electric vehicles. In order to rationalise their operations, construction of Brush industrial trucks was transferred to the Morrison-Electricar factory in Tredegar. Although most of the vehicles involved were industrial trucks, the 3-wheeled Brush Pony milk float was also included, and a number of these were subsequently manufactured at Tredegar. Also included was the SD tractor, which was still selling well, and included a drive unit which had originally been designed for Brush by Morrisons in 1940.

===Preservation===
An early Brush Pony 3-wheeled milk float, formerly operated by United Dairies and dating from 1947, is on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. A Brush 10/14 cwt Mark II bread van, also dating from 1947, and formerly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society, can be seen at The Transport Museum, Wythall. It was displayed at the East Anglia Transport Museum from around 1973, and then moved to a collection of battery-electric vehicles at Blandford, Dorset in 1983. When that collection was sold in 1987, it was given to Wythall, and has yet to be restored. The Ipswich Transport Museum has a Brush Pony electric laundry van dating from 1967 in their collection.

The National Transport Museum of Ireland at Howth has a Brush 2-ton electric lorry in its collection. It was supplied to Dartry Limited, a laundry company based in Dublin, in 1947 as a chassis with bodbywork built locally by Dublin Vehicle Builders of Summerhill. It was used to transfer laundry between Dartry&#x27;s branches, and to service a number of large hotels in Dublin city centre until their decline in the 1970s. It carried the registration number ZH 2511, and was finally withdrawn from service in 1981, around one year before Dartry ceased trading.

==Preserved aircraft==

A de Havilland Dominie DH.89 that Brush built in 1946 for the RAF is preserved at Tangmere Military Aviation Museum on the West Sussex coast.

==Other relics==

The large statue of a falcon from Brush&#x27;s Loughborough works is now displayed in the exhibition hall at the National Tramway Museum in Crich, Derbyshire.

<doc id="992190" wikidata="Q2993787" url="?curid=992190" title="Council of the Federation">
<text>The Council of the Federation (COF; ) is a multilateral congress composed of the premiers of each of Canada&#x27;s 13 provinces and territories, which meets at least twice annually.

Its main function is to promote interprovincial-territorial cooperation, collaborate on shared governmental priorities, and ultimately provide a united front amongst the provincial and territorial governments when interacting with Canada&#x27;s federal government. It also promotes &quot;constructive Confederation&quot;, working for Canadian unity, and recognizing differences amongst the various provinces and territories within Canada&#x27;s federal system of government.

The council meets at least twice a year, with an annual summer conference held in the jurisdiction of the Chair, which rotates annually between premiers; and at least one other meeting at a location determined by the Council. The Council also meets via teleconference periodically throughout the year.

==History==
The idea for a body akin to the Council of the Federation had long been present, but suggestions did not come to fruition until after Quebec Premier Jean Charest raised the concept again during preparation for negotiations with the federal government. The idea was for the first time embraced by all the premiers and the council was formed, its foundation being announced on December 5, 2003, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. This location was significant because Charlottetown was, in 1864, the venue for the Charlottetown Conference (the first step towards Canadian Confederation).

The first test of the council&#x27;s united front occurred between September 13 and 16, 2004, when the premiers met with Prime Minister Paul Martin to discuss reforms to Canada&#x27;s universal healthcare program. The premiers remained united and in the end won $41 billion of federal funding for healthcare over the next ten years.

The 2008 meetings of the Council took place in Quebec City, which was celebrating its 400th birthday as a settlement. At the meeting all premiers agreed to amendments to the Agreement on Internal Trade to create greater labour mobility between the provinces and territories, which came into force on January 1, 2009.

The 2009 meetings of the council took place in Regina, Saskatchewan. The agenda was dominated by economic matters including trade issues with the United States and formulating a post-recession interprovincial economic strategy.

On February 20, 2010, the council met with their American counterpart, the National Governors Association, in a Washington, D.C. hotel, for an hour-long session entitled &quot;Common Border, Common Ground&quot; to talk about issues such as environment and trade. Also attending this meeting were Lisa P. Jackson, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Larry Summers, U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s economic advisor. The Canadian premiers commented on how much more open the Obama administration was to confronting and solving problems, compared to his predecessor, George W. Bush.

==Issues==
* Healthcare funding and innovation
* Economic development (especially in the wake of the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis)
* Strengthening Confederation (working for provincial input into the selection of senators and Supreme Court Justices)
* Reaching out to young Canadians, getting them involved in the political process
* Helping those affected by emergencies
* Inter-provincial/territorial trade
* Water

<doc id="992200" wikidata="Q307613" url="?curid=992200" title="Abdullah Yusuf Azzam">
<text>Abdullah Yusuf Azzam () was a Palestinian-Jordanian Islamist jihadist and theologian. Belonging to the Salafi movement within Sunni Islam, he and his family fled from what had been the Jordanian-annexed West Bank after the 1967 Six-Day War and pursued higher education in Jordan and Egypt before relocating to Saudi Arabia. In 1979, Azzam issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; advocating for &quot;defensive jihad&quot; in light of the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War, and subsequently moved to Pakistan to support the Afghan mujahideen.

As a teacher and mentor to Saudi militant Osama bin Laden, he was one of the key figures who persuaded bin Laden to go to Afghanistan and personally oversee the mujahideen&#x27;s efforts in that country. In 1984, Azzam and bin Laden co-founded Maktab al-Khidamat, an Islamic advocacy organization that sought to raise funds for the mujahideen while also recruiting non-Afghan fighters (known as Afghan Arabs) for their cause. Following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, he continued to promote jihadist militancy on behalf of other Muslims in other countries in an effort that led to him becoming known as the &quot;father of global jihad&quot; in many circles.

On 24 November 1989, Azzam was killed by a car bomb detonated by unknown assailants in Peshawar, Pakistan.

==Early life and citizenship==
Azzam was born on 14 November 1941 in Silat al-Harithiya, in what was then the British Mandate for Palestine, to a family of Palestinian Arabs. As part of the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Azzam was granted alongside most Palestinians, Jordanian nationality. Azzam has been described by most of his biographers as being exceptionally intelligent as a child. He liked to read, excelled in class, and studied topics above his grade level.

== Education ==

=== Muslim Brotherhood ===
In the mid-1950s, Azzam joined the Muslim Brotherhood after being influenced by Shafiq Asad &#x27;Abd al-Hadi, an elderly local teacher who was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Recognizing Azzam&#x27;s sharp mind, Shafiq Asad gave Azzam a religious education and introduced him to many of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s leaders in Palestine. Azzam became more interested in Islamic studies and started a study group in his village. Shafiq Asad then introduced Azzam to Muhammad &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman Khalifa, the &quot;Muraqib &#x27;Am&quot; (General Supervisor) of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. Khalifa met with Azzam during several visits that he made to Silat al-Harithiya. During this part of his life, Azzam began reading the works of Hasan al-Banna and other Muslim Brotherhood writings which greatly influenced his views. The teachings of prominent Muslim Brotherhood members such as Sayyid Qutb and its founder Hassan al-Banna greatly influenced the views of Azzam.

In the late 1950s, after he had completed his elementary and secondary education, Azzam left Silat al-Harithiya and enrolled in the agricultural Khaduri College in Tulkarm, about 30 kilometres southwest of his village. Though he was a year younger than his classmates, he received good grades. After graduation from the college, students were sent out to teach at local schools. Azzam was sent to the village of Adir, near the town of Kerak in central Jordan. According to one of his biographers, Azzam had wanted a position closer to home, but was sent to a distant school after an argument with his college&#x27;s dean. After spending a year in Adir, Azzam returned to the West Bank, where he taught at a school in the village of Burqin, about four kilometers west of Jenin. His colleagues in Burqin remembered him as being noticeably more religious than them. During breaks, while others ate, Azzam would sit and read the Quran.

=== Islamic studies in Syria ===
In 1963, Azzam enrolled in the Faculty of Sharia at the University of Damascus in Syria. While in Damascus, he met Islamic scholars and leaders including Shaykh Muhammad Adib Salih, Shaykh Sa`id Hawwa, Shaykh Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti, Mullah Ramadan al-Buti, and Shaykh Marwan Hadid. Azzam&#x27;s mentor, Shafiq Asad `Abd al-Hadi died in 1964. This strengthened Azzam&#x27;s determination in working for the cause of Islam. During the holidays, Azzam would return to his village, where he would teach and preach in the mosque. Azzam graduated with highest honors in 1966, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Sharia. Thereafter he returned to the West Bank, where he taught and preached in the region around his village.

=== 1967 Arab–Israeli War and the Palestinian cause ===
After the 1967 Six-Day War ended with the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, Azzam and his family left the West Bank and followed the Palestinian exodus to Jordan.

In Jordan, Azzam participated in paramilitary operations against the Israeli occupation but became disillusioned with the secular and provincial nature of the Palestinian resistance coalition held together under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and led by Yasser Arafat.

Instead of pursuing the PLO&#x27;s Marxist-oriented national liberation struggle supported by the Soviet Union, Azzam envisioned a pan-Islamic trans-national movement that would transcend the political map of the Middle East drawn by European colonial powers. 

=== Islamic studies in Egypt ===
In Egypt Azzam continued his studies at the prestigious Al-Azhar University, getting a PhD in Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence in 1973, while being acquainted during his stay with the ideas of Sayyid Qutb. He completed his 600-page doctoral thesis in around 16 months.

Some researchers believe he had a role as an ideologist in founding the Islamist Hamas movement in Palestine.

=== Professor in Saudi Arabia ===
Azzam took a position as lecturer at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he remained until 1979. Osama bin Laden was enrolled as a student in the university between 1976 and 1981 and probably first met Azzam during that time.

== Involvement in the Soviet–Afghan War ==
When the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan on request of the Khalqist government in 1979, Azzam issued a fatwa, &quot;Defence of the Muslim Lands, the First Obligation after Faith&quot;, declaring that both the Afghan and Palestinian struggles were jihads and that all able-bodied Muslims had a duty to fight against foreign occupations of Islamic countries. The edict was supported by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Grand Mufti, Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz.

=== Activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan ===
Azzam began to teach at International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan in 1981. Soon thereafter, he moved to Peshawar, closer to the Afghan border, where he established Maktab al-Khadamat (Services Office) to organize guest houses in Peshawar and paramilitary training camps in Afghanistan to prepare international recruits for the Afghan war front. An estimated 16,000 to 35,000 Muslim volunteers from around the world came to fight in Afghanistan. Thousands more Muslims attended &quot;frontier schools teeming with former and future fighters.&quot; From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only 15 km east of the historic Khyber Pass, through the Safed Koh mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the Hindu Kush range. This route became the major avenue for inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern Afghanistan for the resistance against the Soviets and their DRA allies.

After Osama bin Laden graduated from the university in Jeddah in 1981, he also lived for a time in Peshawar; Azzam convinced bin Laden to help personally finance the training of recruits. Some have suggested that Mohammed Atef was responsible for convincing Azzam to abandon his academic pursuits to devote himself solely to preaching jihad.

Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden&#x27;s fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. To keep al-Khadamat running, bin Laden set up a network of couriers travelling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which continued to remain active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of The News International.

After orientation and training, Muslim recruits volunteered for service with various Afghan militias tied to Azzam. In 1984, Osama bin Laden founded Bait ul-Ansar (House of Helpers) in Peshawar to expand Azzam&#x27;s ability to support &quot;Afghan Arab&quot; jihad volunteers and, later, to create his own independent militia.

In 1988, Azzam convinced Ahmed Khadr to raise funds for an alleged new charity named &quot;al-Tahaddi&quot;, based in Peshawar. He granted Khadr a letter of commendation to take back to Canadian mosques, calling for donations. However, the pair had a sensationalist showdown when Khadr insisted that he had a right to know how the money would be spent, and Azzam&#x27;s supporters labelled Khadr a Western spy. A Sharia court was convened in bin Laden&#x27;s compound, and Azzam was found guilty of spreading allegations against Khadr, though no sentence was imposed.

Employing tactics of asymmetric warfare, the Afghan resistance movement was able to fend off the militarily superior Soviet Armed Forces throughout most of the war, although the lightly armed Afghan mujahideen suffered enormous casualties. The Saudi Arabian government and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gradually increased financial and military assistance to the Afghan mujahideen forces throughout the 1980s in an effort to stem Soviet expansionism and to destabilize the Soviet Union.

Azzam frequently joined Afghan militias and international Muslim units as they battled the Soviet Union&#x27;s forces in Afghanistan. He became an inspirational figure among the Afghan resistance and freedom-fighting Muslims worldwide for his passionate attachment to jihad against foreign occupation.

In the 1980s, Azzam traveled throughout the Middle East, Europe and North America, including 50 cities in the United States, to raise money and preach about jihad. He inspired young Muslims with stories of miraculous deeds, mujahideen who defeated vast columns of Soviet troops virtually single-handed, who had been run over by tanks but survived, who were shot but unscathed by bullets. According to his stories also, angels were witnessed riding into battle on horseback, and falling bombs were intercepted by birds, which raced ahead of the jets to form a protective canopy over the warriors. Steven Emerson&#x27;s 1994 television documentary &quot;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America&quot; includes an excerpt from a video of Abdullah Azzam in which he exhorts his audience to wage &quot;jihad&quot; in America (which Azzam explains &quot;means fighting only, fighting with the sword&quot;), and his cousin, Fayiz Azzam, says &quot;Blood must flow. There must be widows; there must be orphans.&quot; Azzam recruited the Al Kifah Refugee Center as the Marktab al-Khidamat&#x27;s official branch in the United States, the only country to have one aside from Pakistan. Azzam also radicalized El Sayyid Nosair, the man responsible for the assassination of Meir Kahane in 1990. In 1989, the FBI office in Dallas started investigating Azzam for his role in recruiting foreign mujahideen fighters for the Soviet-Afghan War.

After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Azzam became disillusioned with the breakout of the Afghan Civil War in which former Muslim members of the mujahideen fought each other. Azzam initially supported Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin in the war, but after meeting Ahmad Shah Massoud in the Panjshir Valley switched his preference to Jamiat-e-Islami. He compared Massoud to Napoleon and told audiences in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, &quot;I have seen the future of jihad. It is Massoud!&quot; This put him at odds with bin Laden, who continued supporting Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin.

===Global jihad===
Azzam&#x27;s trademark slogan was &quot;Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues.&quot; In &quot;Join the Caravan&quot;, Azzam implored Muslims to rally in defense of Muslim victims of aggression, to restore Muslim lands from foreign domination, and to uphold the Muslim faith. He emphasized the violence of religion, preaching that, &quot;those who believe that Islam can flourish [and] be victorious without Jihad, fighting, and blood are deluded and have no understanding of the nature of this religion.&quot;

Azzam has been criticized for justifying the killing of civilians deemed &quot;mushrikeen&quot; (polytheists) in jihad, telling followers that:
Many Muslims know about the hadith in which the Prophet ordered his companions not to kill any women or children, etc., but very few know that there are exceptions to this case. In summary, Muslims do not have to stop an attack on &quot;mushrikeen&quot;, if non-fighting women and children are present.
Given the broad definition of &quot;mushrikeen&quot; used by some Muslims, at least one author (Dore Gold) has wondered if this could have led to followers being less concerned about killing women and children.

However, Azzam&#x27;s son, Huthaifa Azzam, has told journalist Henry Schuster that his father did not generally approve of attacks on civilians.

Azzam built a scholarly, ideological and practical paramilitary infrastructure for the globalization of Islamist movements that had previously focused on separate national, revolutionary and liberation struggles. Azzam&#x27;s philosophical rationalization of global jihad and practical approach to recruitment and training of Muslim militants from around the world blossomed during the Afghan war against Soviet occupation and proved crucial to the subsequent development of the al-Qaida militant movement.

Like earlier influential Islamist Sayyid Qutb, Azzam urged the creation of a &quot;pioneering vanguard&quot;, as the core of a new Islamic society. &quot;This vanguard constitutes the solid base [qaeda in Arabic] for the hoped-for society. ... We shall continue the jihad no matter how long the way, until the last breath and the last beat of the pulse – or until we see the Islamic state established.&quot; From its victory in Afghanistan jihad would liberate Muslim land (or land where Muslims form a minority in the case of the Philippines or formerly Muslim land in the case of Spain) ruled by unbelievers: the southern Soviet Republics of Central Asia, Philippines, Bosnia, Kashmir, Somalia, Eritrea, and Spain.

==== Ties with Hamas ====
He believed the natural place to continue the jihad was his homeland, Palestine. Azzam planned to train brigades of Hamas fighters in Afghanistan, who would then return to Palestine and carry on the battle against Israel.&quot; He viewed Hamas as &quot;the spearhead in the religious confrontation between Muslims and Jews in Palestine&quot;. During the First Intifada, he supported Hamas politically, financially and logistically from his base in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan.

This put him at odds with another influential faction of the Afghan Arabs, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The next group of &quot;unbelievers&quot; the EIJ wanted to make jihad against were the self-professed Muslims of the Egyptian government and other secular Muslim governments, not Israeli Jews, European Christians or Indian Hindus. For the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, takfir (excommunication) against the allegedly impious Egyptian government was central, but Azzam opposed takfir of Muslims, including takfir of Muslim governments, which he believed spread fitna and disunity within the Muslim community. Towards the end of his life he said “I’m very upset about Osama. This heaven-sent man, like an angel. I am worried about his future if he stays with these people.”

==Assassination==
In 1989, a first attempt on his life failed, when a lethal amount of TNT explosive placed beneath the pulpit from which he delivered the sermon every Friday failed to detonate. The Arab mosque was in the University Town neighbourhood in western Peshawar, in Gulshan Iqbal Road. Abdullah Azzam used the mosque as the jihad center, according to a Reuters inquiry in the neighbourhood. Had the bomb exploded, it would reportedly have destroyed the mosque and killed everybody inside it. After the first attempt, Prince Turki bin Faisal of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s chief of staff Ahmed Badeeb advised Azzam to leave Afghanistan.

On 24 November 1989, Muhammad Azzam was driving his father and brother to Friday prayers in the Saba-e-Leil Mosque in Peshawar, when unknown assassins detonated a bomb as the vehicle approached. Lying in a narrow street across from a gas station, the explosive had a 50-metre detonation cord which led to the sewerage system where the assailant presumably waited. According to &quot;Time&quot;, political analyst Waheed Muzhda had noticed what he assumed was a crew doing routine road maintenance working on the culvert where the bomb was placed, the day before the assassination. Azzam and his sons were buried near the same site as his mother the year before, the Pabi Graveyard of the Shuhadaa&#x27; (martyrs), in Peshawar.

===Suspects===
Suspects in the assassination include competing Islamic militia leaders, such as Hekmatyar, as well as the CIA, the Mossad, and KHAD. Following the assassination, the President of Afghanistan Mohammad Najibullah criticized Arab foreign fighters telling them to go do &quot;jihad closer to home&quot;. Najibullah was a very active opponent of Wahhabism which he saw as contradictory to traditional Afghan values. Former FBI agent Ali Soufan mentioned in his book, &quot;The Black Banners&quot;, that Ayman al-Zawahiri is suspected of being behind the assassination. Azzam&#x27;s son-in-law, Abdullah Anas, accused the Egyptian Islamic Jihad of killing his father-in-law for issuing a fatwa that &quot;once the Russian were ejected from Afghanistan, it would not be permissible for us to take sides.&quot;

Several associates of Azzam suspect the killing was part of a purge of those who favored moving the jihad to Palestine. In March 1991, Mustapha Shalabi, who ran the Maktab al-Khidmat, the Services Bureau in New York and was also &quot;said to prefer a &#x27;Palestine next&#x27; strategy, turned up dead in his apartment.&quot; He was replaced by Wadih el-Hage, who later became bin Laden&#x27;s personal secretary.

Osama bin Laden has also been accused of being a suspect in the murder, but seems to have remained on good terms with Azzam during this time. However, it was reported that Bin Laden and Azzam also had a major dispute on where Al-Qaeda should focus their operations. Bin Laden favored using the organization to train fighters in various parts of the world while Azzam favored keeping the training camps in Afghanistan. Azzam also objected to Bin Laden&#x27;s favoring of Hekmatyar.

Yet another actor accused of the assassination is the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, an active opponent of Wahhabism. In 2009, Jordanian double agent Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi claimed knowledge of Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate cooperation with the CIA to set up the assassination.

==Legacy==
After his death, Azzam&#x27;s militant ideology and related paramilitary manuals were promoted through print and Internet media by Azzam Publications, a publishing house that operated from a London post office box and an Internet site. Both were shut down shortly after the September 11 attacks and are no longer active, though mirror sites persisted for some time afterwards. Babar Ahmad, the administrator of azzam.com, was extradited from the UK to the USA where he pleaded guilty to &quot;conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism.&quot;

Azzam popularized the idea of armed Islamic struggle (which went on to be developed further by groups such as the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA)). Prior to his work, declarations of jihad in the twentieth century (such as against Israel) were essentially rhetorical and served more as a religious blessing of wars already declared and organized by secular bodies. But with his tireless travel and exhortation of activists, thousands of whom traveled to be trained and to fight in Afghanistan, what Azzam &quot;called for actually came about&quot;.

Azzam also broadened the idea of jihad. Azzam preached that jihad was
* the transcendent in importance – &#x27;one hour in the path of jihad is worth more than 70 years of praying at home&#x27;;
* and had global significance – &#x27;if a piece of Muslim land the size of a hand-span is infringed upon, then jihad becomes fard `ayn [a personal obligation] on every Muslim male and female, where the child shall march forward without the permission of its parents and the wife without the permission of the husband&#x27;
Azzam had considerable impact. Fatwas going back to the Crusades had urged Muslims to defend one another against an invasion, but his contention that &quot;such defense was a global obligation,&quot; that &quot;Muslims everywhere were personally bound to take up arms&quot; against invasions such as the Soviet&#x27;s, was &quot;all but unprecedented&quot;.

Azzam is thought to have had influence on jihadists such as al-Qaeda with the third stage of his &quot;four-stage process of jihad&quot;. This third stage was &quot;ribat,&quot; defined as &quot;placing oneself at the frontlines where Islam was under siege&quot;. This idea is thought to reinforce militants&#x27; &quot;perception of a civilizational war between Islam and the West&quot;. While the organization of al-Qaeda was founded by Osama bin Laden, it is believed that Abdullah Azzam started the idea of creating a &quot;base&quot; organization for jihad to spread around the world. His son Huthaifa Azzam, who assumes his father&#x27;s legacy, on the other hand, says that al-Qaeda&#x27;s methods of targeting civilians in the West or elsewhere would have been rebuked by Azzam, as would have been the use of kidnappings and beheadings.

The internationally recognized terrorist group Abdullah Azzam Brigades (a Lebanese branch of al Qaeda) is named after Azzam.

== Published works ==
Having &quot;published over 100 books, articles and recorded conferences&quot;, some of his books include:

* &quot;Defence of the Muslim Lands: The First Obligation after Faith&quot;, 1979 (many typographical errors); 2002 (second English ed., revised with improved citations and spelling.) Is a study on the legal rulings of Jihad. It discusses the types of Jihad, the conditions under which Jihad becomes an obligation upon all Muslims, parents’ permission, fighting in the absence of the Islamic State and peace treaties with the enemy.

* &quot;The titans of the north&quot;, was a book written by Abdullah Azzam but which he was unable to get printed. In it, he praised noted commander Ahmad Shah Massoud (who was later assassinated by Al-Qaeda) but because almost all of Peshawar was semi-owned by warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a rival of Massoud, no one would print it there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Hayat/Ariana&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>IC 2602 (also known as the Southern Pleiades, Theta Carinae Cluster, or Caldwell 102) is an open cluster in the constellation Carina. Discovered by Abbe Lacaille in 1751 from South Africa, the cluster is easily visible to the unaided eye, and is one of the nearest star clusters, centred about 149 parsecs (486 light-years) away from Earth.

==Description==
IC 2602 has a total apparent magnitude of 1.9, and contains about 75 stars. It is the third-brightest open cluster in the sky, following the Hyades and the Pleiades. Its apparent diameter is about 50 arcminutes.

IC 2602 is likely about the same age as the open cluster IC 2391, which has a lithium depletion boundary age of 50 million years old, though the age estimated from its Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is about 13.7 million years. IC 2602 is thought to form part of the Lower Scorpius–Centaurus association.

== Components ==
Theta Carinae is the brightest star within the open cluster, with the apparent visual magnitude of +2.74. Theta Carinae is part of the asterism known as the Diamond Cross, which is often mistaken for the Southern Cross asterism in the constellation of Crux.

p Carinae (PP Carinae) is another third-magnitude star known to be a member of IC 2602, although it lies well outside the main visible grouping of stars. p Carinae exhibits a variable apparent magnitude ranging from 3.22 to 3.55.

All other members the cluster are of the fifth magnitude and fainter, but several are naked-eye objects, including HR 4196 (V518 Car), HR 4204, HD 93194, HR 4219, HR 4220, HR 4222, HD 92536, HD 93738, and V364 Carinae.

An exoplanet has been found orbiting the star TOI-837 in this cluster.

== History ==
IC 2602 was first discovered by French astronomer and abbot Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille on March 3, 1751 while in Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. In Lacaille&#x27;s initial discovery, he classified Theta Carinae (referred as &quot;Theta Navis&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Theta Argus&quot;) as a third magnitude star, whilst citing the cluster&#x27;s resemblance to the northern Pleiades.

== Observation ==
Positioned at a declination of -64º on the night sky, IC 2602 is most clearly visible from the southern hemisphere, and appears circumpolar from southern subtropics and temperate climates; the cluster is observable from a limited selection of north hemispherical regions, mainly tropical areas. IC 2602 is identifiable a few degrees south of the southern Milky Way, surrounded by various fifth and sixth magnitude stars. To the unaided eye, several faint stars are distinguishable to the east of the blue Theta Carinae.

<text>In baseball, a cleanup hitter is the fourth hitter in the batting order. The cleanup hitter is traditionally the team&#x27;s most powerful hitter. His job is to &quot;clean up the bases&quot;, that is, drive in base runners.

== Theory ==
The thinking behind the use of the cleanup hitter is that at least one of the batters before him will reach base somehow, usually via a walk or a base hit. Traditionally, the lead off hitter, the number one spot in the batting order, has good foot speed, plate discipline, and a high on-base percentage. The second batter is usually a contact hitter, meaning he is able to consistently make contact with the ball and put it in play to move base runners forward and into scoring position. The first or second batter might bunt his way on base as they both will be speedy runners. The third batter is usually the best batter, the hitter with the highest batting average. He has the role of scoring runs himself, but his job comes down to getting on base for the cleanup hitter to have a turn to bat in the same inning. The cleanup hitter coming up to hit—if he has runners on base—has the opportunity to produce runs by getting a base hit or a home run. The third and fourth batters tend to be interchangeable in the batting order. The fifth batter in the lineup also has the job of batting in runs, in effect a backup for the cleanup hitter. He shares multiple traits with the cleanup hitter and therefore can compete for the cleanup hitter&#x27;s spot in the batting order. Batters six to nine typically descend in batting skill level, meaning that the ninth batter is often the least effective batter in the lineup.

== Trends ==
Each individual hitter&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses determine their spot on the daily lineup card. As the number four hitter&#x27;s primary responsibility is to turn base runners into runs, a hitter with a high slugging percentage and batting average, especially with runners in scoring position, is generally preferred to the higher on-base percentage (OBP) and low strikeout rates of hitters earlier in the lineup. A manager may also take into account a batters tendency to hit in clutch situations or focus on home run ability. Since the home run is by far the most sure-fire method of batting in baserunners, the annual Home Run Derby tends to be a who&#x27;s who of cleanup hitters from around the league. That being said, a hitter with an unspectacular home run rate who is instead reliable when it comes to extra-base hits can also be a valuable tool for scoring with runners in scoring position (RISP). It is ultimately a question of how well a player fits into the rest of the lineup which determines the run-scoring potential of the cleanup spot.

== Designated Hitter ==
The designated hitter (DH) is a batter that hits for the pitcher and never plays defense. The DH is important because the DH is usually one of the better hitters. It is a trend that the DH is either in the third, fourth, or fifth spot in the lineup. The DH was adopted by the American League of North American Major League Baseball in 1973 and by the National League in 2022. In games without a DH, the pitcher hit in the lineup unless another player pinch hit for the pitcher, in which case the pitcher left the game and was replaced for the team&#x27;s next defensive half-inning. Between 1973 and 2022, when there were interleague games and the National League was the home team, the American League team did not use a DH, and their pitchers took their turn at bat.

<text>IC 4665 (Collinder 349 / Melotte 179) is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Ophiuchus, about 1° to the northeast of the star Beta Ophiuchi. It was discovered by Swiss astronomer Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745. The cluster lies about 1,100 light years away from Earth. It is easily visible in the smallest of telescopes and also with binoculars. From a sufficiently dark place it is also visible to the naked eye. It is one of the brightest clusters not to be cataloged by Charles Messier or William Herschel, probably because it is so loose and coarse.

Age estimates for this cluster have ranged from 20 up to as high as 100 million years. Comparison of the stellar lithium depletion with other clusters suggests it began to develop about 55 million years ago. The upper main sequence turnoff age is  Myr. 819 candidate cluster members have been identified. Two chemically peculiar stars were found to be members in 1977.

There is evidence that IC 4665 is undergoing a collision with the older cluster Collinder 350, located about 4° away. Currently they are separated by a distance of , after having formed at least apart. It is unclear whether the two clusters will merge as a result of the collision.
